can be dismissed for Sunday school if you'll go in the Psalms with me we're going to go to Psalms 39 this morning Psalms 39 there's like 13 verses here I said I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my tongue I will keep my mouth with a bridal while the wicked is before me my heart was hot within me while I was musing the fire burned then spake I with my tongue behold thou Hast made my days as in hand breath and My AG is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best stus altogether vanity Sila and now Lord what wait I for my hope is in thee I was dumb I opened not my mouth because thou did it when thou with when thou with rebu us dust correct man for iniquity thou makest his Beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is Vanity Sila this's one together oh spare me that I may recover strength before I go hands and be no more God bless you may be seated brother Brian good morning brothers and sisters you know I was just thinking as we were reading as we were reading that Psalm this morning you know people have a tendency to want to build kingdoms here on the Earth but you can't take it with you you can build all the wealth have all the natural things in the world but when you die you can't take them with you so and like the psalm was saying the only thing we have hope of is what's on the other side and I was just thinking this morning over there um you know the world we live in is just headed to Oblivion they're just they're you know your preachers will tell you they they've they're going through the guard rails well they're they're past the guard rails they've overrun any type of semblance of modesty or morality in the world today they just run completely over the top of it and they're just headed to Oblivion and there's no coming back and I was just thinking over there about you know in the book Pilgrim's Progress the the first step you had to make is you all had to come everyone had to come through the wicked gate if you didn't come through the wicked gate you weren't going to be there on that day and is when you came through the wicked gate you went to the house of The Interpreter and you received your certificate if you didn't have that certificate no matter if you didn't come through the gate and you didn't get that certificate on the other day when they asked to see it you were lost and it and simply it means if you have haven't received salvation through the baptism of the Holy Ghost where God has placed his spirit in you you won't be there on that day and everything in the world this morning is trying to get you from that way they want you to go every other way but the right way this morning and I was um I was thinking if you you don't have to turn to it and it and I was thinking I was reading in job also this morning in the last couple of days I you don't have to turn to this chapter but it's in job 16 you got to be careful who your friends are but this is what job had to say to his friends not trying to have some humor here but and these are the three people that came to job to be to talk to him and this is what job had to say about him then an excuse me then job answered and said I have heard many such things miserable comforters are you all and he's basically telling his friends you haven't been any help to me you have accused me of secret sin of of hiding Sin from the Lord but none of this am I guilty of and I'm jumping over here to uh I was reading in Jeremiah thinking of I'm if I'm jumping around you'll have to forgive me this morning but I was thinking also in the world that with what's going on in Israel this morning the whole you know the Bible says the whole world will turn its face against the the children of Israel and is is it as it keeps each year goes by each month goes by you can see the whole world is just just ready to go on the different things I will just read this is what uh God's word said out of teronomy excuse me Jeremiah the 47th chapter it's not a very long chapter this has to do with Gaza this is what the Lord from Jeremiah had to say about Gaza and the area of Gaza is where the Philistines used to live many thousands of years years ago and this is the prophecy that Jeremiah gave to the Philistines and the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines before the Pharaoh smoke Gaza and he goes on to say thus sayeth the Lord behold Waters rise up out of the North and they shall be an overflowing flood that shall overflow the land that all that is therein City and them that dwell therein then the men shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land man shall how at the noise of the stamplistic and from sedan every helper that remaineth for the Lord will spoil the Philistines and the remnant of the country of my pronouncing a in here cap the baldness to come upon Gaza and Escalon to cut them with the remnant of their Valley how long will thou cut thyself oh the sword of the Lord how long will thou ever thou be quiet put up thyself into thy Scabbard rest and be still how can be quiet seeing the Lord ha given it a charge against a ascalon and against the seashore that he hath appointed it so as I read that I know this morning that once God makes a prophecy like that it's going to come to pass and the and I was just thinking the world is going to support things that they're not going to that have any purpose but I'm going to jump over to Daniel and I was just thinking sometimes when you look at the state of the world and the current position that it is this morning and like I said coming at that Wiki gated the whole world is just going to be deceived one day that and I I was just thinking of the politics that the world is ready to receive somebody to give them peace to make everything okay the world that's the world's getting to a point this morning where they're looking for someone to make everything right for them and we know the scripture says that you can't change it it's going to go to destruction one day and it's just headed that way and we have a we have an ability right now through the word of God we know the end State we know the beginning and the end and I was going to read but I I was thinking of a guy one time his name was Nebuchadnezzar and you know God used Nebuchadnezzar to bring judgment to all the world around him and I'll just read but uh he had a dream one time and this is what Daniel told him the interpretation of the dream was but we're the world is just like Nebuchadnezzar I'll just read what it I hope I don't read too much the it's it has to do with the tree not reading all of it and I'll read where Daniel gives the interpretation starting at the 26 22nd verse of the fourth chapter here it is thou oh King Thou Art grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reacheth onto heaven and thy Dominion to the end of the Earth and where is the King s i Watcher a holy one coming down from heaven saying you the tree down and destroy it yet have the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even the band of iron and the brass in the tender grass of the field let it be wet with the Dew of heaven and let its portion be with the Beast of the field till seven times pass over him and this is the interpretation oh King this is the decree of the most high where has come upon the Lord my Lord the king that thou shalt Drive thee from men excuse me that they shall Drive thee from men and th dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and thou shal make thy make thee to eat the grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the de of the heaven and seven times shall they pass over thee until thou knowest that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and give it to whomsoever he will so Daniel's giving him this prosy and then he goes on and finishes here he says where has thou commanded to Le the stump and the tree roots thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known the heaven do rule wherefore oh King let my counsel be acceptable so Daniel's talking to the King after the interpretation oh King let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sins by righteousness and thy iniquities by showing Mercy to the poor if it may be the lengthen of thy Tranquility so after the prophecy Daniel's trying to get the king to do right trying to open his heart to the true word of God and then we go on and and this came upon the King Nebuchadnezzar and then 12 months later uh and at the end of 12 months he walked into the Palace of the kingdom of Babylon and the King spake and said is not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of Kingdom by the might of my power for the honor of my Majesty so he's after 12 months he forgets everything that Daniel talked to him and he's lifting himself up and not God who did it through him and my Majesty while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from Heaven saying oh King Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and and they shall Drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field that they shall make thee to eat the grasses the otion seven times shall they pass over thee till thou knoweth the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and giveth to what someone will he will when I read that I think I can apply it to myself you know sometimes everything is going good for you everything everything it just seems like everything's being perfect and sometimes you you can think of yourself more than you really need to be in those situations and you'll do something stupid you'll say something stupid and all of a sudden all the good things just disappear within an hour within a few seconds s and your whole world will fall apart around you and what Daniel is telling Nebuchadnezzar and the truth that's being revealed here when you think of yourself more than what you really are that's when you're going to have problems in this life you always have to think of yourself like God like there's nothing good about you and the only thing that you get good is God's mercy for you and that's what Nebuchadnezzar had to learn I'm not going to read it all but after seven years God spoke in Nebuchadnezzar again and he testified that God is God and his kingdom was returned to him and what I'm thinking we have example after example in our lives of when God raises people up or when God brings people down and I was just thinking even this morning we have examples of that I have examples in my own life where I've made mistakes and everything I thought was was going to be okay has been totally thrown away and then I have to start all over again it's no different for any of us but I was just thinking about old Nebuchadnezzar in this world that we live in I mean they've there is no more stops anymore there's no more um there's there's no guard poost for them anymore there's no gate stopping them anymore there's nothing stopping them the word of God isn't stopping them anymore they're headed to Oblivion and we don't want to be following them to Oblivion this morning we want to get back to the word of God and follow the word of God as it instruct Us in the message of the hour this morning and as I see you know I can say this as I get older I realize that all the things I say this a lot I'll keep saying it all the things that I thought was important when I was 30 or 20 or even 40 I realized that almost 65 that those things aren't as important as I thought they were the only real important thing for me this morning is to have a relationship with Jesus Christ and everything that I do should focus on that this morning to be successful in that and like I was saying you know in Pilgrims Progress if you you have to this is going to slide off this Pulpit here if you didn't have that certificate you weren't going to be there on that day and why go for you you there was a couple of examples of people that didn't have they went through all those struggles they went through all those situations but because they didn't come through through the wicked gate and they didn't come the right way it didn't mean anything on the end and it's the same for us if there's any little sin in you holding you back or something that you know you need to make right it's not going to go well for me or anyone on that day if you don't if you haven't come the right way and this morning I that's what I've heard from a lot of the ministers that come over the last several weeks it's real important that everything that we do is on the right foundation this morning and that Foundation is Christ through the word of God and the message for the hour that we all believe this morning anything outside of that it doesn't really mean anything this morning brother Josh amen good to be in the house of the Lord this morning why don't we just stand to our feet are you happy to be a Christian this morning how many has a need this this morning how many wants more of God this morning well it looks like we're in for a treat and God's bound to deliver so good to be in the house of the Lord and uh why don't we just sing that little chorus uh peace of God

many years I wrote this little song when I was 16 years old last weekend I was in Canada preaching and the Lord just put it back on my heart and I just going to try it again today well many Christians today have let Satan steal away the Victory and joy of the Lord although they pray and they press they have failed to confess that we have overcome sing and we have overcome through this word Victory

lips that we confess oh this bride will stand the test oh we have overcome oh we have overcome oh yes we have overcome praise the Lord amen and amen and praise the Lord stand with me if you will this

part 2 Samuel chapter N9 if you got your Bible amen and if not they're going to put it right up here above you amen so if you're a lazier Christian amen they got it fixed for you amen oh I just teasing you trying to make you smile a little bit 2 Samuel chapter 9 verse 1 two and three and then we're going to skip down to verse six and seven the Lord helping us I want to speak to you this morning upon a seat at the table a seat at the table and our scene opens the this morning with um David King David this is many years after the death of Saul and both Jonathan and he is inquiring of the the relationship or the kin or the family or whoever it might be Amen in the family of Saul David said is there yet any that is left in the house of Saul that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake there was at the house of Saul a servant whose name was Zeba when they had called him unto David the king said unto him art thou Zeba and he said thy servant is he the king said is there not yet any of the House of Saul that I may show kindness the kindness of God unto him and zebus said unto the king Jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet verse six and M when MTH the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was come unto David he fell on his face and did reverence and David said MF and he answered Behold thy servant and David said unto him fear not I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually let's pray over the word Lord Jesus we're so thankful for the opp to come into your house Lord as we look into the word of God this morning to look into the pages of the Bible and the message Father it would take more than just the human instruments the senses that we've been given to be able to understand and comprehend how it all fits together therefore Lord as we take this moment to Bow our heads and to talk to you we do so Lord with the idea that if you don't come and open our hearts and our minds and our eyes and our understanding what we've just read means absolutely nothing to us but Lord Jesus if you will come this morning and take your word and that you will anoint it anoint me as the speaker anoint them as the receiver and let us all be receptive me included Lord that we might hear from you and that you would anoint us and open our hearts and Minds father we know that beyond a shadow of a doubt what we've read will not only affect us but change our lives so we're asking that you will come upon all that's been accomplished thus far and bless it and then Lord in the further part of this service may your anointing fall upon this word and anoint it as well help me Lord just to get out of the way completely that you might use me to speak to your children those things which they need to hear and Lord may you close my mouth to anything that is not becoming Lord or may not be appropriate for this season of their lives help me Lord to hit the targets that you want to hit this morning and Lord may we just keep pressing and pushing Lord until you've accomplish what you want to accomplish this morning as we commit these things to you in the name of Jesus Christ chist we pray amen and amen and all the saints said amen you may be seated God bless you thank you brother I do believe that's the first good amen I've heard out of y'all so far amen got mad at me over the lazy Christian remark sorry I pick sometimes amen you one thing you'll learn about me if I don't pick on you it means I don't like you so if I tease you a little bit then you know that you got my heart amen we thank the Lord for the reading now just looking at a couple of these things in the Bible about this particular story now now mind you there's a lot more to this that you can read that'll be a great blessing to you if you focus on it when you get to focus on it what you'll find is that the the history behind this boy the history behind his whole family and the family line coming from Saul Jonathan all the way up until you see mblf enter the scene and all of the particulars if you will that uh surrounded this um this setting that David is asking about the feeling of the people whether there's anybody left in the house of Saul now this is a very crucial thing for David because we know that David in his Bedrock beginnings and his first interactions with Saul when he comes up to the place to where now he is interacting with Saul uh over the challenge that Goliath makes you know he he no doubt as he came in to play his harp and he came in to have these great discussions with Saul at different times you know there was a big part of David that no doubt looked up to Saul as being what we would call today a mentor and we would think that perhaps maybe in his mind the way he would think that Saul would be somebody that he was very connected to not just by the way of Flesh and speaking back and forth but something very deep must have resonated in David's heart for who Saul was because we look at Saul from the perspective of almost like a uh like a business office in a sense he was a king and David was working side by side and they had conflict but this for David was much more than just an arrangement of such this was more to David than just well uh you know I I'm going to do a service for the king and you know maybe get paid or uh get accolades in the Kingdom but but for David this was a responsibility that he not only committed himself to physically using his talents and his gifts to help Saul but in his heart he knit himself together to be a complete and total dedicated servant to King Saul even though you imagine this is the complete absolute complete permissive will of of God alt together God never wanted Israel to have a king God never wanted them to be ruled or controlled by a king and yet here we are and David even in this permissive will condition decides this is the way God has allowed it and I'm going to follow through and be loyal as an Israelite you know and I think it's amazing how that you see the heart of David and the kind of attitude he had toward these kind of situations and then you meet people in the message and around that will be they'll be in a permissive will type situ situation and rather stay committed to the Lord if they can't have a perfect situation well they just throw everything baby and bath water out and say well I can't even serve God we could take a lot of notes from the way that David behaved himself in situations that were not perfect per se and I think that it was good for David to have this laying in his heart for a couple reasons the first reason I believe it was good for David was because David was in need of someone to kind of ruffle his feathers a little bit you know he'd been on the back side of the desert and he'd had so many victories and so many great things had been accomplished for him that he never really got to see the negative side of anything he never got to see what a leader who does the wrong thing uh look like he never was affected by someone that would lie to him or betray him or double cross him now in our mind way of looking at things we would say oh that's that's awful we we need to avoid such situations you know you read books today and you hear TED talks and you hear these people on YouTube different ones that'll say do your best to avoid a toxic situation anybody ever heard that terminology avoid toxicity but yet you realize as a Christian one of the first things that God does when you are good and ready is he does he don't just just nudge you he kicks you right in the middle of a toxic situation and that is like an eagle he takes you and kicks you out of the nest and says Fly Boy and see what you can do about it' and I think sometimes we think in our mind I believe we think that it's a bad thing to enter into such situations but actually the real people of God shine they shine forth their real character of who they are when everything is as wrong and as bad and as ugly as it can possibly be as a matter of fact the uglier it is the prettier the bride becomes I like that can you say Amen right because in those situations these are the things that form the character and mold those good things in us that make us what we are you don't really know what's inside of you you don't really have a clue of what you can accomplish in the Lord until you have buted up and went head to-head and competed against these kind of situations like that you know you wonder do I have love well just meet somebody that has perfect hatred you'll find out if you've got perfect love find out if you've got joy meet somebody that's negative all the time and all that effect and how they are around you and then just watch that something of God Bloom out of your life amen I believe that these things are not only necessary but I believe these things are going to be present in our life every day that we live and folks listen to me people in this world today in this 21st century we're living in with these young people sitting around here they are inundated every single day with the idea find peace find solitude find comfort and ease and yet you'll realize that that is not what brings true happiness in a person's life I I I had one of my students was telling me the day one of my polar students I teach English to and and he's he's fairly fluent and so he could describe this to me pretty good and he said he was reading a study about 10 men that they had taken and these men were multi- multi-millionaires raised to millionaire homes they had always been chauffered every meal had been cooked for them and uh you know they never met La their own bed they' never done any work somebody always cleaned for them and whatever whatever whatever they had a problem in school then somebody always done you know the tutoring and helped them along they never really offended for themselves and these 10 men and I don't know why it wasn't women it just men specifically I guess in the study but these 10 men were absolutely as unhappy as it could possibly be so they decided let's do something different Let's do an opposite of their life and see what results it brings so they made them fast several days they made them wear old clothes they made them Drive thems cook for themsel clean for themsel and after about a month of this they went back to evaluate the emotional state of these 10 men and lo and behold you would think oh they were more miserable than they'd ever been wrong a thanks for playing but actually they were more happy than they had ever been in their entire lives why because adversity negative brings something out of us that we would never see had not it showed up at our doorstep thank God for every time the Lord Jesus allowed us to go through hard times you understand that you'll understand why James made that perplexing statement my brethren counted Joy when you fall into divers Temptations I've always wondered about James making such a remark I thought that poor guy somehow or another he must have slipped his pen and put the wrong thing in there but it's the word of God it's got to be just that way why he had a revelation negativity brings out the positivity the dark expresses the night the bad expresses the good come on you with me all of these negative things bring out what's really inside of Us Praise the Lord you never know if you're good in math until you get a test you don't know how great you are in English until somebody sets a big exam in front of you all you can boast and walk around like message people do the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said but we wait till the test comes you'll find out when the test comes whether or not you got the goods of what you're talking about or not yes sir that's right now for David this negativity actually didn't make him worse of a Christian we would say it actually made him better you would think that in David's heart after having javelins thrown at him being called a dog being told that he was the worst person on the face of the planet being called all kinds of names being double crossed betrayed back bit lied to you'd think it would turn David into a person of such negativity and toxicity that he would spew his hatred to anybody got within a foot of him but actually it brought out a Sweetness in David it brought forgiveness and mercy in so much as to when those men had convinced him to go to the cave and cut a piece of Saul's garment the moment he done it he had such an affection for Saul that it smoted his heart that he dare touch the Lord's anointed you know in the day we live in smot His Garment I'd like to rip his face off his skull well Hallelujah the angels have showed up this morning okay all right Angels good flap your wings now y'all know better than that be honest in church God knows you're lying don't lie in church there are people you get so aggravated at you'd like to rip the goozle out of them three head nods four eye blinks you're doing better I'll get closer oh yes I'm a Believer but you're a human first and that human part of us that emotional side of us that person gets damaged and wounded and many times takes the hit before it actually drains down into the soul and it makes it so challenging for us you look at how brother Bram dealt with the complex of being rejected his entire life cuz he was raised in a bad with the Brams having a bad name always was poor alcoholic and everything else in the family and yet here is brother brandham with everything that God is going to do with this man struggling after after years of successes to take one moment and say you know what the Lord has done good around here we've accomplished some great things the Lord and I but he finds himself in a parking lot reading the license plates just to encourage himself that people didn't hate him that human side of us gets so deeply scarred so affected until bitterness and grudges and those kind of things can settle into us and we stay there forever or you say we don't I know people in message churches families that are split completely in half that ain't spoke to each other in 40 years and yet will sit on the Pew and worship and Shout speak and tongues run and dance and everything else in the world and yet have that thing hiding inside of their heart does God bless them sure in some ways he does but they can never fully move up into that full stature of a perfect human being until they achieve that part of Brotherly kindness and the true love of God where they are able to put themselves in somebody else's choose and learn to forgive as the old axim is to forgive is divine it takes God to put that inside of your heart and here is a man friends to our shame here is a man without the Holy Ghost and yet was able to obtain the power of forgiveness within himself by the grace of God he was able to forgive a man that was so vile today we would have called Saul bipolar because one day he loved David the next day he hated him one day David was the greatest thing he ever laid his eyes on and the next day he absolutely despised the ground He Walked on how many of you would like to live in such an environment all the time some of you have some of you have lived with the narcissist or you've lived with those bipolar type personalities or with those double-minded people like that it's misery and it leaves such an impression on you that it's almost impossible to erase that from your memory here's David sitting with his Little Harp singing the Lord is my sheer I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pure he rests and restores My Soul by Still Waters the man understood that as a human being he had no ability to do this within himself it took God to get him there and he also knew that Saul didn't anoint himself Saul was chosen by God even though God never wanted Saul to be in the place at first remember we told Samuel they didn't reject you they rejected me and yet God in his mercy and his grace appointed somebody to the desires of their heart mind you it was to the leanness of their soul yes but God still provided for them a king it goes to prove sometimes friends we think that God ain't going to do nothing for us because we're in a mess or we got problems or we haven't repented right or we got stuff to fix God will still bless you right on top of of that as long as your heart is willing to do the right thing it's only when you're stubborn and hard-headed and arrogant and egotistical and won't repent that's when you get in trouble with Jesus that's when he cuts all the blessings off is when you refuse to be hot soft-hearted with all the stuff that David did God said he's still a man after my own heart and now here we are many years later and after the death of Jonathan and the death of Saul Now the nursaid runs in haste Brother Brad runs as hard as she can to flee and like any human being might do she slips or Falls or tumbles or whatever she does and accidentally drops this boy MTH and causes a crippling injury that keeps him from being what we would call normal for the rest of his life now the thing you have to understand about this boy when he comes before David to me this is so remarkable David calls this boy into his presence you have to understand where this kid had come from his very name a fi actually means a breathing shame being the son of Jonathan and also the grandson of Saul here he is the descendant of the very King that God anointed his name signifies that he's not only a shame but a breathing shame he falls into a life of poverty and winds up into a city called Lo dear which the very name loar means lack lack of Life of poverty I wonder how many people spent time sitting around the dinner table when M ff's name would come up and said boy you know that was something about that kid how awful that was that poor boy I can't believe that woman what was a matter with him she should I as a baby she should have held on to that baby now that poor kid look at him did you see him in the street the other day begging no doubt like other children are my my wife's brother Chris some of you met him had a fetal stroke because of forceps around his head squeezed a nerve and caused a a a fetal stroke and his his right arm is crippled like this and he walks with a bit of a limp you actually can see a lot of those injuries from that time when they'd used forceps in the way they did I see a lot of people on the road that's got that same kind of injury as Chris and people always made fun of him he had to have brain surgery when he was 10 and have a shunt put in his brain because if not he would have been what they used to call years ago a Waterhead kid here is injured and my my wife you know the first time she ever learned to fight she said was when somebody made fun of Chris let me tell you something that little Spitfire woman of mine she'll bite your kneecap you better watch out old Pennsylvania Tennessee girl she rough as a corn cop oh she's sweet whenever she petting a kitty this way but don't believe her Hey listen she tough God knew how to make her she had to live with me then they'd make fun and put him down you like boy did you see him the other day in rags what good is his life anyway some people might have went and said why don't he just kill himself that's what young people he on social media these days you know the world as we know it looks at any imperfection as though there's something wrong with us but God orchestrated this fall cuz remember it was the fall that put him in that shape in the beginning the fall is what caused his breathing shame the fall is what caused him to live in low debar we've all been to that City haven't we low debar a place of lack a place of poverty I think I'm the mayor of the place sometimes how they must have looked at him in shame but David David because of his heart for Saul and his soul the Bible said was knit to his best friend Jonathan when David calls maef into his presence David looks upon this boy not as a breathing shame not as a beab bond or not as a a criminal of sorts or not as just a beggar when David looks upon this boy his heart is reminded this is a son and Grandson of a king and in his blood is royalty you see friends the world looks upon you as though you're not exactly what you need to be like take our girls for example they're under so much pressure in this day and age for for everything from makeup and fashion and how to dress and how to live who says they're the boss of how you ought to do God didn't create just you created all kinds of people so one person doesn't have the Monopoly on what says what Facebook sure isn't my authority neither is Instagram Tik Tok or any of these other social media hell pits oh they can do some good but you know as well as I do they're nothing but a hell pit sometimes but that's what our kids face in this day and age quit preaching your TV stuff that's so Antiquated and outdated they don't even understand what a TV's about like we used to you old people me too they don't live in that world they live in a completely different world than we do than we did what they're up against science says within 11 seconds whatever image they see is ingrained into a subconscious part of their mind and it stays there forever how many hours of people scr rrolling through their social media Pages how much do you think actually enters into your subconscious mind and you don't even know it's there because it doesn't come through the first conscience as quickly as it comes through that subconscious part and every image you see will tell these girls to be beautiful you got to do this to be sexy you got to do this to be hot you got to do this hang on young people the old people are about to pass out on me but I've got to use terminology that they understand whether you do or not to be hap happening in Hip I'm using old people terms now you got to dress a certain way act a certain way behave a certain way and if there's any imperfection in you at all you might as well forget about being anybody at all but I got news for you and for the devil God takes imperfections and uses them glory to God for his glory to do great things for the kingdom of God we don't have to look at imperfections as a handicap especially since there's royal blood flowing through you oh glory to God the thing I wondered about was I wonder what David thought because if you read more of this chapter here the very next verse we stopped with verse eight when he comes before David he bows himself down like this somehow I don't know how he done it and he calls himself a dog and I wondered to myself when he heard those words I wondered Wonder something flashed through David's mind of all the times that he knew Saul was out to kill him but yet David would come before Saul and say my king I'm so privileged for you to come to me a flea a dog when he sees this boy call himself a dog I've always wondered did David stop and have a flashback no doubt maybe this is the point where the devil might have said to the boy to David now's your chance kid you know all that time you wanting to get even you want to get even with them over that social media post or what they said to your friends or that picture they spread around now you got them all you got to do is hit sin click post but you see when David looked upon this boy he didn't look upon him as an object or a target of his revenge nor did he pity Mev you see because I think sometimes we get in our mind that when God calls us for salvation it's as God is looking on us like we're a crippled up pathetic mess a breathing shame God's just having Mercy on us because we're such scum we're so low down and so good for nothing come on somebody preach to me that God God just looks down on us and says I've just got to have pity on them they're so pathetic they're so worthless but that is not the reason that God saved us brother BR said God don't run his business like that he said he didn't bring his son down here and say you know now somebody feels sorry for my boy said if God run his office like that he said what kind of a mess would it be anyways God knew who is going to save you for the foundation of the world and He sent Jesus to save those and so here comes David he looks down upon maef and he has a choice but you see because of the passion in his heart for the things of God and because he was dedicated to truth and fairness God's fairness not our version when he looked at this boy he said those words FF I want you to realize that for the rest of your life you have a seat at the king's table and do you know what I love about this type the seat was chosen before MF showed up the decision was already made before M said yes or no I got news for some of you you think you're in control of your life your destiny is not your own and we make all of these plans and these decisions I'm going to do this and I'm going to go to college and I'm G to get a certain education I'm going to marry a certain person and I'm going to drive a certain car and I'm gonna go to a certain place of business and I'm going to make so much money the Bible said if you're going to say it say if it be the Lord's will don't say I'm going to do this or that and make it absolute say if it's the Lord's will I'll do that cuz you don't know what tomorrow holds for you and you don't know what your destiny is come on somebody but God holds our destiny in the pal of his hand whatever he wants from me that's what I want when I get to think and I'm going to do a certain thing oh you better watch that arrogant spirit because you'll do what you do as God Wills you to do it and if you think you're bigger than him try him sometime and he'll show you how big his foot is when he kicks you through the wall smacks you upside the heads wake up dummy you say how do you know I've had it oh yeah the early days of being a Christian I hear that about spoken word spoken word speak the word so I was just going to do it all speak what I wanted do what I wanted do what I wanted you want to make God laugh just tell him your plans W preach brother man think I will come on we cannot decide based on where we were raised we cannot make decisions based on our background or our history God can take all of that disable tangle that toxic mess and do something beautiful out of it if we'll only allow him to do what he said he was going to do all things work together for the G of them that are the call according to his purpose amen amen if we can trust him like that and we don't have to worry about nothing then you can sing what I sang I ain't worried because God's in control praise the Lord do you imagine what this kid might have thought hearing David say these words now Meb have saw himself as a loser because he identified himself not with his true identity but he identified himself hang on everybody with who he thought he was big difference between who you think you are and who God thinks you are that one got so deep to some of you it couldn't even shake your head amen you see yourself in so many different capacities humans have this ability to kind of see the strengths and the weaknesses and then there's this MC mesh of whatever in between there are so many mysteries of God that quite honestly when the Lord reveals them they're the easiest things to understand and learn as you've ever got but there is one mystery that for the last 33 years I've been trying to figure out and that is the mystery of people they're the most complex and difficult to unravel one scripture says this one scripture says that one poet writes this one poet writes that one psychologist says this one doctor says that the Bible says this the Bible says that you think you got people figured out until you meet someone that is an absolute Enigma weirdos strange people you think how in the world could they think such a thing is normal how could they do such a thing and yet there they are it's kind of like brother Carol used to say about women preachers they said you believe women preachers I got to they're on every street corner not that he did but they were around same thing with us we think oh I've got life figured out until all of a sudden this curveball comes out of nowhere and you're swinging away and you can't hit it where' that picture come from that's the mystery poor girls they don't understand any of the analogies I'm using do that you wonder sometimes how this boy is so much like us in the way of how we see us his his identity was what was formed and fashioned based upon his history except for the history that spoke to who he really was is it funny how we have a tendency to cut off the main part and focus on the stuff that doesn't really matter anyways oh you say that's mean it doesn't matter he's crippled up he's a he's a beggar but in God's eyes and also in David's eyes it didn't matter what we put so much weight in what we put so much worth and value upon to God means nothing I've been like this boy sitting in church like you hearing men of God preach just like I'm preaching and hear them say you're the bride you're an overcome you're a conquer you're this God loves you this that and the other and sit there and think to myself how in the world could God really love me you say nobody uhhuh weirdos just don't forget that we're weird we're strange we're odd we are because the parts we should be screaming amen we're sitting there going how who what where when why oh praise the lord well one thing I've learned about El when I get you quiet I got you right where I want you why do we do that to oursel because we shape what we believe our own identity really is based on experience es we've had you take a person getting ready to get married take a young man young woman and they're inching toward getting married if they've ever had any bad relationships before that every relationship they ever had they will take those experiences and they will carry that baggage over into this new thing and the second he or she says something that sounded like their mean Daddy or mad mama or boyfriend or girlfriend that cut him or abused them or done some evil thing or hurt their feelings they see that person not the one that's in front of them why you form your identity of what you believe and friends when it really gets concrete it takes God to take that thing away from you and you've got to be willing to get rid of that too because if you're not willing to say to the Lord Jesus take all of this out of my heart move all of these thoughts away from me remove from me what I believe and fill my heart soul mind body strength with what you believe that's the only way you're going to win in this life is God has to fill your heart your soul your mind your body everything with what he believes about you why do you think we preach what do you think you come to church for it's so that we can by the grace of God somehow preach it in a way that you'll let go of this and let the word fill the other glory to God hallelujah That's The Power of preaching the gospel that demon is cast away from you and that idea is wrapped out of you or cut by a two-edged sword and then then the Holy Ghost can go into that absent place and go here's what I think about you you think you're a loser my fibf but I don't believe that about you I wonder how many nights this kid sat around going oh oh my life is such a mess oh I'm never going to make myself anything I'm never going to accomplish anything yet with all of them thoughts that MF had the one thing he never realized was that he was on David's mind too so don't worry where you're at in your life don't worry about it the King has got you on his mind he's thinking about you he's meditating on you he's meditating on you you know how you sit around you think about certain things and you meditate and you go back over and over and over is it hard for us to believe that Jesus is also meditating on us you know the Bible said about a minister that is to attend continually continually upon the needs of of the people he's preaching to well if a preacher is supposed to contend and always continue thinking over and over how can I help this one how can I bless that one how can I free this one of that what quote what scripture what thing can I find to help them overcome if I'm thinking that way as a preacher how much more is Jesus thinking that about you when he sees you've lost this and you've went through that and you've had this problem and that problem how much more is he thinking upon you meditating he's got his mind on what your needs are he's got his mind on where you're coming from and where you're going and whether we like it or not he don't see us the way we see ourselves I don't like that I know because it takes the control out of your hands but that's the way God wants us sometimes vulnerable weak and exposed because if you don't get there he can't help you you think you got it all wrapped up and Life by the tail and you got all this figured out that's when you're goingon to get in trouble praise the Lord no doubt this boy defined himself by his shortcomings comes before David and calls himself a dead dog that's pretty low ain't it you understand this terminology that he's using in the Bible in the Old Testament they wasn't even allowed to receive the tithe off a dog because it was considered the lowest animal in all of the animal kingdom nothing against your Pooch but we're talking about Old Testament now and this boy doesn't even call himself a dog he calls himself a dead dog it tells you where his mind was at what he what he thought about himself it's like the saraph phenician woman when Jesus says not me to give the children's bread under the dog the real translation when she said yes master but the dogs she didn't say dogs the real translation of that is the little dogs she humbled herself even lower Jesus called her a dog the lowest thing she made herself even lower than that I'm not even a full grown one I'm a baby dog a puppy praise the Lord what Jesus say I haven't found Faith like this in all of Israel because you know sometimes name calling is appropriate because God likes to test you sometimes to see what you're going to do it's like I said to someone just the other night what would you think if you were living in brother bram's time and you were sitting in the Pew and you sitting there as a woman and he said you got makeup on your face hello good morning Miss dog meat you know what the modern day woman does same thing they done back then call me dog meat I have you know I'll go to somebody else's Church they've got live streaming other places but a real Christian lady does when she hears things like that she says that's right I'm a dog not even a dog I'm a little dog but here my fi Chef is making himself even lower than that I'm a dead dog David says oh my if he could talk and maybe add comment narrative to this maybe David would have said something like I don't see you that way why do you see yourself that way why why do you think of yourself in this manner don't don't you love sermons like that when the Lord comes along and anoints Men of God to preach to you just in that manner here you've been beating yourself up all week made some stupid mistake or you're living with something in your past and in your mind you're just constantly wrestling and battling and you're telling yourself how awful you are all of a sudden Here Comes King David in the Pulpit I don't see you that way I don't see you as a failure I don't see you as a loser you're an undone creation of God dominated by the devil and I'm not here to have pity on you I'm here to offer you a seat at my table why so he can begin reidentifying himself because he's a royal he's a royal person so David wanted him to live like royalty eat like royalty talk like royalty function like royalty live in Royal places no wonder Paul said we are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus God wanted us to go ahead and get a little taste of what royalty felt like on this side glory to God not wait till we get to the Millennium not wait till we get to heaven but he said I'll catch you up right now in the Heavenly places so you can know what it's like that's why when we pray read the Bible come to church and we get caught up in that atmosphere that's why it's good for us to get a taste of what it means to be royalty praise be to God now let's turn to Exodus chapter 30:1 let me show you a couple types and in some of these types I want to show you we're going to kind of change the scene just a little bit but we're going we're staying with the same idea here about imperfections and things of this nature I I want to show you how this fits in Exodus chapter 3 vers 10 I want you to pay attention to how he words this and Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it horns of the altar once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements once in a year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your Generations it is most holy unto the Lord now if you have a a pencil a paper a pen or something you want to make a note some maybe your device or something Leviticus chap 16:34 Leviticus 16:34 I'll going give you one more numbers 6:14 Leviticus 16:34 Numbers 614 each one saying and make an offering without blemish bringing that that offering to the to the altar of the Lord now I want you to pay attention to the reality of this we read these scriptures and we think very like tunnel vision we just see one little thing but you have to really expand your view and look at all of Israel at this time you realize that in the Kingdom of Israel was there not that there was not only just the people that God cared about but also the animals the animals were also a part of the inheritance as we know Moses told Pharaoh not one hoof will be left behind God God cared about the animals so much brother Brad that when brother bradam was translated beyond the curtain of time he said all you ever loved and all that ever loved you would be there and about that time his horse and his dog appeared before him God loved these animals so much that he gave adam the ability to name them but now after the fall you know the thing that crippled up M michef and made him a breathing shame same thing that made us a breathing shame as Man became the Breath of Life came into man he became a living Soul after the fall we became a breathing shame when you take the breath of life no matter how pretty that little baby is when it comes to the age of accountability and it comes to the place to where that it can understand right from wrong watch and see what happens that little nature starts coming out they lie and they do all kinds of things and you think as a parent where in the world where in the name of God did they learn to do this stuff was born in them just like it was born in you parents ins seert your amen here aha them kids ain't tell only heathens you scream at You' be screaming at yourself too cuz you were just like them once come on now right we just forget we get so old and holy and you know walking in angels wings and all this that we forget that we used to be the same way I have to remember when I see my girls do things that absolutely just baffles me I get man I said go what's the matter with you and I said whoa bji little doggy they're only doing the same stuff you did when you was a boy God had mercy on you amen amen you see how people begin to just think about that one point for a moment you think about how people just begin to emerge their true self just emerges after some time little kid that little baby that girl that boy and they're so sweet and they're so kind and then all of a sudden this nastiness comes from somewhere parents are so shocked I know I'm the same way my girl my daughter my son what you think he was Raising little Jesus hello Mercy y'all getting Baptist quiet now keep this up we might be Methodist quiet for that's not just not go down we're trying to go up but the mindset becomes where raised in a message oh wait but every one of us no matter where we come up raised in the message not I was too by the way my mother and father came in in 68 I was born in 77 they' had been in the message several years I was here because of the message my mom was reading a book one day where brother B talked about the woman being the beding ground of Life the Lord moved on her my father and mother decided to have another child she miscarried I came along right after that March the 10th 1977 I was here because of a message book so I was raised on the Pew just like you guys are I know what it means to be raised in an environment where just believe the message believe the prophet on and on and on I know what that means but because of the Fall I'm a breathing shame until I receive the Holy Ghost baptism in my heart and I'm a crippled up mess not because of what I've done only but because of generations before me that passed things down to me that made me a crippled up mess and so because of the Fall thorns and thistles dysfunction brother talk about this seed of discrepancy he said that Satan sprayed his DDT called it and different little chemicals and things on the earth and now it produces all of this ugliness so now we go back to the scene in Israel where now God is demanding a paint to keep from seeing the sins of the people and now the the the the the order the standing order is find one lamb that is perfect what a tall order in a time of hybridization in a time of imperfection imagine trying to find that today you can't even go to Walmart without getting a bunch of hybrid tomatoes or maters I am in Kentucky ain't I I guess I don't have to speak Yankee come on now everything is deformed but God says I don't care if that cold over there and I don't care if that Ram over there and I don't care if that over there and that over there and that over there and that over there is blind Hal withered crippled missing something broken whatever it might be I want one perfect lamb and that one perfect lamb is going to stand in the place GL right all the rest of the crippled up little animal M chefs and so Aaron takes this Blood puts it upon the horns of the altar now we think in our mind that the paint was just some kind of little thing maybe on the altar but you realize when this sacrifice was offered it's the same as that Blood Ring that went around the world the paint painted all of Israel and when God looked down at the nation of Israel the entire nation he looked through red saw their red sins and could only see white praise be to God why not because of all the crippled up Lambs not because of all the other animals that were raised in the message but because of one perfect lamb oh Hallelujah brother B tells a story about this old Colt he said he said the when the master gets home he'll knock me in the head but he said if that mother farmer could talk she'd say look he said he offered a lamb for the household he said and brother R said the awfulest thing you ever seen is an old mule these aren't together tail sticking up in the air and he cross eyed I said I've preached to people like that in church say certain things they get crosseyed or tail up and they and their legs all which away and I've seen them thumb through Psalm books and fidget and jump and run to the bathroom 148 times I guarantee something you see people start doing that stuff they need a prayer line or they need a whip in one of the other praise the Lord somebody but in all that brother bam talked about this little crippled up disfigured mule he said if that Mama could come by that Mama farmer the wife the far of the farmer oh he'll knock me in the head I'm a disfigured a monstrosity I said if she could speak she'd say no you don't have to worry because he offered his perfect lamb for the whole household glory and now this lamb takes the place and dies so the the disfigured mule can live glory to God that's you and I disfigured crippled up because of the foul a breathing shame living in low dear in a place of lack but because of the perfect L Hallelujah Glory because of one perfect lamb come on somebody because of one perfect sinless Holy Lamb this disfigured mule can live on brother B says what a picture of redemption he said that little old mule could just kick his little old heels up in the air don't forget clapping's good but don't forget you're kicking up in the hill too worship of the Lord and say praise the Lord and Nod in your head that's good too but don't forget the running around part remember God don't want just formal religion when you really get set free and you realize that the Lord Jesus took your place it'll make you more than just a form a little golf clap Christian it'll make you holler amen and praise the Lord come on somebody help me clap on Lord amen clap on but don't let it become a formality CU it's so easy for us to get settled into the rut of Praise the Lord hallelujah Jesus died for my sins amen you understand what I'm saying to you we shouldn't just be settled into this idea well if you could only go back and remember how disfigured you were how crippled up you were it make you clap your hands all right amen make your shout praise the Lord cry snot roll in the hay whatever you want to do amen well you say it's not sanitary I know it wouldn't look good on social media but that's the way some Christians need to behave it do them good sometimes just to get free from the idea of the formality of it this is what happens in some of these other denominal churches and I dare say in the message churches the same we preach these kind of things and we're just kind of oh well praise the Lord isn't that great yeah Jesus died for my sins when's the last time you looked in the mirror to see that you're crosseyed when's the last time to see that your tail don't operate right and your legs aren't straight hello unless of course we've blinded oursel with message theology so deeply that we become these holy righteous people within ourselves that have no imperfections oh I know that's a bad word the bride is perfect she is if she's laying under the blood of a spotless lamb but she's not perfect within herself praise the Lord I didn't mean to discourage you clapping I was trying to make a point I did that one time got a bunch of people mad at me I wasn't trying to discourage your clapping I'm just making the point we don't want to become forign about these things do we we want to remember the impact that the revelation of what Jesus really done for us because you know I'll say this for us older ones after so many years we start to lose sight because we're so far separated from that Old life if we're not careful the devil get us on the other side we get this mentality of everything's okay and I'm all right and but Lord never let me forget what kind of condition I came here by the Fall that way I can always appreciate what you've done for me praise the Lord I never want to forget what he's done for me let's go just a little bit further can we Ephesians chapter 2 verse2 call me crippled up call me an old mule crosseyed well how you think you got here you think you were born a thorough bread oh I know that's the predestination idea of it God saw me before the F yeah but he's not talking about you he's talking about you not you cuz this mother and father they put me in a bad condition and it took the blood of Jesus Christ to change who I was in here even though I'm the same man out here hair colors the same eye colors the same genetics chromosomes all the same but in my heart I'm a new creation by the grace of God and by the blood of Jesus Christ now watch what Paul says about us Gentiles This Is Us people here tonight or this morning I should say Ephesians 2 and2 then at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope without God in the world all right now message people brag because he's not talking about Israel he's talking about us now let's brag about what we've got in our compendiums and how many tapes we've listened to and how many bibles we've read according to this right here you don't even have a brag coming nor do I praise the Lord somebody according to that I was a crippled up MF an alien a stranger without hope and without God the word he uses here for aliens is to be shut out from one 's fellowship and intimacy not only were we completely shut off we were not even invited we were shut out of God's fellowship and love and care and concern and comfort and peace friends stop for a moment and than thank when you sit in this church this morning and you feel the atmosphere like you feel right now and you hear these little things and feel things from the Lord these little bubbling things that come up the goodness of God and you feel this stuff working in you and around you don't you know how blessed you really are not only did God open the door and kick it wide open and say come on Gentiles it's your turn but he opened up himself to his fellowship and his intimacy when before that we were completely sh out just like the foolish virgin standing at the door knocking as a matter of fact we were in such a condition we didn't even care to knock we didn't care what the door was we wasn't interested in it until the door showed up to us till the door came to me oh I like that I didn't go to the door the door came to me huah cuz I wasn't looking for God and neither was you Ephesians chapter 4 now verse 17 oh praise the Lord hope I didn't discourage you clapping now I feel bad I got in trouble for that once I don't mean to discourage you clapping clap please clap God Almighty please clap verse 17 Ephesians 4:17 this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that she henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk watch in the vanity of their mind this is what I was saying before when you start making plans for yourself that's vanity you don't even have to say things like oh I'm not a good Christian I not even talking about that but it is Vanity to entertain that you control your own destiny oh you say I'm a free moral agent whoa you might be but if you're gods and you belong to Jesus I don't care what decisions you make he's got a pathway already determined for you down the road and you will take it amen because if God is determined to get us right he will see fit he couldn't leave us to our own decisions we would never decide for the right way come on somebody we would never make that choice but God made it for me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he decided for me before the foundation of the world he determined in his own mind what I would be how I would to live in this world and where I I would go my destiny would be amen amen amen and he knows if I take this road it's okay because there's another road that leads right back to this if I go this way it's all right it's going to go right back to there if I go here it's all right it's going to go back to there and the roads that would keep me from going back he just shuts them off all together I don't even take them some people might have got nervous if they would have known the story of Job like we or Jonah like we know it some of might have got nervous looking over the banister of Heaven seeing him go down to Tarsus but not the Lord the Lord wasn't worried cuz he knew before J before Jonah made the decision to go down to Tarsus for about all 40 years there had been this fish that had a deformity in it that had a big throat that was just a prophet siiz swallower and that fish had already been prepared Hallelujah before Jonah went down to tarus there was already a road back to Nineveh no matter what you think you've decided or what road you think you've taken just hang on Jonah there's another road that'll take you back to him don't worry little prodal you might wind up in the hog pin but there's a road back to Father's House glory to God [Applause] hallelujah amen it's vanity to say I'm going to do this I'm going to do that I'm going to go here I'm going to go there I'm going to be this when I grow up I'm going to be this when I get married I'm going to vanity then it's vanity for parents to say my kids going to be this my kids are going to do this my grandma and grandpa we're going to do this we're vanity you need to add these words to everything you think if the Lord be willing get that lesson down the rest of your life is smooth sailing you hear me the rest of your life is smooth sailing because you think oh I've got a a business acument I can do this and I'm smart with numbers I that may be true but God may not allow you to succeed in that because he may have another plan for your life and real Christians want only one thing what Jesus wants amen look at the next verse having the understanding dark here's that word again being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance of sin that is in them because of the blindness of their heart so they can see but they can't see they have eyes but they can't understand anything you tell them about Christ tell them who they are and fibf says no I'm just a loser I'm a dead dog I'm no good I that may be true in your eyes that are darkened alienated blackened out you may see yourself like that but if you can only allow the Lord to let you see yourself through his eyes then it's a whole new world your perception of yourself changes alt together when you see yourself the way he he does Colossians 1:21 if you'd like to write this down again Paul said you were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled oh I love this brother Bron said that was me William brandham no good not fit to live worthy to go to hell born in a sinful family raised a sinner no good not one sound part about me well I wish the tape people would say what he said there well I could quote what a God he was wish theyd quote this one one time brother bradam didn't see himself the way a lot of people have seen him he realized what he was but if you'll watch this quote carefully he goes so far and stops the next thing he says but one day I accepted Hallelujah he says when God looked down on Christ and Christ took my place then God don't see me he sees the perfect one one cuz you see there's the balance we can recognize who we are here but we have to stop after so much and say you know what I may have been born this I may have been crippled up I may have been these other things but one day God's mercy and Grace got a hold of me you see the problem is we like to live sometimes in that down trash low low dear that downcast type of living but God wants you to see this you can recognize your your weaknesses of who you are as a human being in this world but also draw a line that may be true but God who was rich in mercy God who was rich in Grace Hallelujah saved me delivered me brought me up out of the out of the muck and the m to make me what I am today praise the Lord little fur I'm going quit I'm going quit I see the time in the 10 virgins brother BR says it like this he says oh I was that barabus I was the one that deserved to die and he took my place imagine I I was thinking of this the other day and I thought to myself what it must have been like for this man in this prison cell no doubt he prepared himself for months years we don't know weeks he's going to Calvary and he's going to be crucified and all of a sudden he sees that big Roman soldier come down through there and he hears them chains are clanking and he hears all that that armor and all that stuff clinking together and them big heavy boots walking down and stick the key in the lock so to speak and pull the door open one of them big Burly guards walk in there maybe a big old red beard like I got rabbis you're free what don't don't be playing with me man don't be playing with me now you're not you're not trying to trick me is this a joke did you hear me I said you're free get out what H how how could that be you you all coming to take me to Calvary in just a little bit no not today listen if it was up to me you'd be rotten up there right now Birds picking your eyes out you low down filthy criminal we know you come here a minute pulls him out of the cell and right down the hallway can see at the end there's Pilot's judgment homeall you see that man standing that purple robe on him and that crown of thorns on his head what in the year we're allowed to release is a prisoner and the people didn't want you they wanted him that's the one that took your place did you imagine what it must have felt like for him to look down that hallway so to speak and see Jesus standing down at the end of it you know the amazing thing history records that barabus is first name barabus was his surname the first name of barabus was actually Jesus Jesus barabus and can you imagine what it must have felt like to realize I'm not going to die at Calvary after all because you see when we look up and see the three crosses we see the thief here the thief here and Jesus in the middle but the origin scene would have been one thief barabus and another thief but you see the thief that was on his left it was he pardon right the left side I should say correct left right yeah left correct the thief on his left side was predestinated by God to be pardoned by Jesus at Calvary and you see Not only was the road to Calvary a predestinated pathway for all of the whole world but there was one little thief up there that needed some personal intimacy and contact with Jesus his whole life had been spent doing the wrong thing while he's hanging at Calvary and he hears all that's going on and the scene that's unfolding before him Jesus looks and says you believe that can you say Amen to that LE Thief says you better believe I can Amen to that he said this day you'll be in Paradise he said Lord remember me you you understand it doesn't matter how you come we all have a destiny if God wants us there we're going to come whether we like it or not if you ever get some time to listen to this interview this is right before brother BR preaches the Masterpiece this is an interview with sister Bruce and he's talking to sister and he's telling her you know all the little things that's going on in her life and how he's watched her and all that but I love I love how brother Braham says this this is in July of 64 if you'd like to look it up he tells sister Bruce we've got a blood sacrifice laying there listen to these words God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we are Christian glory to God can you imagine this is how Rapture and resurrection's going to happen because for us the shout is the message the voice comes from the shout The Voice come the heart of the elect there you are standing there looking in the mirror one day and your hair falling out or getting gray and got wrinkles in your high sister and you're wearing glasses and false teeth and all kinds of things and all of a sudden you feel like this sharp and something moves on you the Holy Ghost moves on you says speak just like everything else in your life that you've done by faith rapturing faith will culminate with a voice from the elect that comes straight from the voice of God and I believe this with all of my heart that the elect of God will just simply speak it change you know why'll happen because it won't be our voice it'll be his voice speaking remember he said when he called for the name of Lazarus had not he specified Lazarus the entire Resurrection General all together would have taken place right there and where is the voice of God in the last day no longer in brother brandom it's in the elect of God that's how when Cancer's in your body that's how when you're eat up with diabetes and blood pressure problems and and and all kinds of other things PCOS and ADHD and all these other little acronyms and diseases they've named in the last days that's why when you really claim Faith like you need to claim it and you really stand on the promise of God say no more and you say body from today on I am healed if you say that with the true Faith Of God it ain't you speaking and that's the reason things start changing right there cuz it's not you talking it's the voice of God in one place brother B says he hears your voice he turns to see you and sees Jesus there it's the lamb actually talking for you God help me to always no matter how blinded these crippled up old MF eyes are help me remember that I am a King's son and that I can speak like r praise the Lord over the past several months the Lord moved on me some time ago as you know I've been in pretty poor health for the last couple years eat up with blood pressure problems and diabetic things and all that but early this year the Holy Spirit moved on me and in certain ways and showed me some things that I I I that I I need to claim and I need to do differently and as I stand here before you by the grace of God I'm completely off all of my high blood pressure medicines I've got normal blood pressure my eyes are healing my vision's coming back and right now I'm in the process of kicking that diabetic thing into remission first of all thank you for your prayers second of all I want to remind you that the Lord Jesus Christ can speak through your mouth in the simplest of ways all you got to do is believe him and trust him and say lord it's not me anyways I'm a crippled up old mule with cross eyes but Lord your perfect sacrifice is what makes me who I am today let's stand again together praise the Lord let's bow our heads with your heads bound I wonder just before they play in this quietness like this I wonder how many of you in the church this morning would stand here and say brother Ben I just see that crippled up identity that I've always been that's all I ever see maybe it's a young person people at school or people in social media even other churches in the message it's a shame to say this but I've heard of so many situations girls and boys going to camps and Revival meetings and running into these Center message kids that need the baptism of the Holy Ghost need to be saved say all manners of evil and hatefulness and things like that may may maybe you just see yourself in a certain maybe that identity is sticking with you I'm a loser I'm no good I'm shame and I but maybe today you'd like to say Lord Jesus I want to see myself differently I want to see myself the way you see me I wonder if you put your hand in the air and just tell the Lord right now God help me see differently my goodness look at the hands going up around this building thank you Lord Jesus for every one of them again don't let it be formality now let this be the Cry of your heart tell Jesus sincerely tell him when you hold your hand up before for him tell him sincerely Lord I mean this I want to be different I want to see different I'm not just raising my hand because it's something we do and brother Ben's asking us too well okay but listen if you mean business with God God will mean business with you so be deathly sincere as sincere as you know how say Lord from the bottom of my heart I want to see myself differently brother Ben will it come now maybe not month from now perhaps not but whatever faith that you put before him today don't let go of it don't stop it don't hold back on it put one foot in front of the other and keep stepping and claiming Lord you see my confession and my testimony today and from today on I'm asking you Lord to make things different in my life you know there may be some of you here today that are stuck and can't get to the baptism of the Holy Ghost over this very thing I'm preing right here because how can you have faith that God wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost when you don't believe you're worthy of any of that and friend there's a difference in seeing that you're not able to do it within yourself and then just simply putting that in front of you and and Jesus and saying well God I'm not worth it anyhow and you're you you put so much doubt in front of you that he can't move for you you got to push all that out of the way children every bit of it all you little children of God in here whether you're old children young children middle I don't care who you are you got to push all that doubt away from you and say Lord this depression I'm fighting this suicide Spirit or this cutting Spirit or this vaping thing around the school or you know if it's young people or something like that or if it's the the pressure from families for us older people it's you know moms and dads and cousins and mother-in-laws and these type of people that pressure me with this and that you got to just shove all of that out of your way and say Lord I got one thing to focus on and that's to do the will of my father help me God to get all of these little voices and things out of my way so I can focus on the right things just friends time ain't stopping for nobody and if you're a young person in here you'll blink your eyes and take one step ahead of you and be in your 40s like me you look back on your life and you think Mercy where did time go make all the best steps you can make right now this moment don't wait today is the day of salvation so in your heart decide now just decide and clinch it and say from today I'm moving on in Jesus name now bow your heads with me I want to pray with you father for every need that was represented here this morning I offer one short simple prayer that you would help them strengthen them give them the ability to walk into that Vision in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen praise the Lord let's sing something amen anything you want make more God bless you friends I love you don't get mad at me about the Clapping thing I didn't mean to hurt your [Music] feelings I make points at B time sometimes I don't mean to but you say all right now what do I do keep walking Enoch walked with God didn't he keep walking you don't need hands laid on you you don't need somebody anointing with you allil screaming at you and praying over you if the Lord will we'll do it you want somebody to pray an anointed prayer over you fine but you know what would make more of a difference for you to realize that we your own faith your own confidence in God standing right there that was able to help you get down the road I would love to pray for you if you wanted Brother Brad these other ministers around if we got other brothers here that preach they would love to lay their hands on you they'd be honored to do so I would be honored to do so but after what I've preached to you today it's going to mean more to you if you just claim your simple faith and watch it manifest before your eyes then you'll know that you're not just riding anybody's coattails but your confidence in God is true and sure and that God hears your prayer too you love the Lord did this help you today bless you appreciate you folks love you in the Lord all right sing for us let's Worship the Lord a bit before we [Music] go like the Jesus make more like the amen give me a heart like David that's fil with love and be more like thee [Music] oh if you'd like to come pray and talk to the Lord the altar is open to if you'd like to just come and kneel down for a moment just say Lord I just want to tell you I'm thanking you and I'm praising you Lord for what you've done for me today the altar is certainly open if you want prayer we'll pray but otherwise give me a heart that's filled with love and make be more like the sing it again make me more like the Jesus make me make me more like let's just raise our hands to the Lord all together now and give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like the I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no for love I could never ever out
