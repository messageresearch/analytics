Lord Jesus, we come before you tonight thankful, Lord, once again to gather ourselves together in your name, Lord. And Father, how precious it is to know that you promised 2,000 years ago, Lord. And you have kept your promise for 2,000 years that wherever two or three were gathered in your name, there you would be in our midst, Lord Jesus. And we're so grateful to have you in our midst, Lord. Father, we thank you, Lord, for the leadership of the Holy Spirit in our lives, Lord. Knowing, Father, that it is the comfort of our life, Lord. It is security of our life. You're all to us. You mean everything to us, Lord. And that's why we've gathered on this Wednesday night, Lord. Come from near and far, assembled in your house, Lord. Took time apart, Father. Set this time apart, Lord, to come to worship you in spirit and in truth. Lord, come to the open doors, Lord Jesus. Our hunger, our heart hungers for more of you, Lord. Thirsts for more of you, Lord. In a dry and a thirsty, Lord land, Lord. We know there's a spring of water bubbling up, Lord Jesus. A fountain, Lord, to get quench every one of our thirsts, Lord. Meaning, Father, if we have need of healing, Lord, we can be healed. If we have need of salvation, we can drink salvation, Lord. Whatever it is that we have need of, Lord, we can come to that fountain and drink and be filled and go from here, Lord Jesus, satisfied. We're so grateful, God, for a place that we can come that we can eat and drink and be satisfied when the world is groping. Father, they're eating and drinking and can't never get satisfied, never happy, Lord. Father, I ask, God, that you'll just bless this service tonight. Bless the meditation of our hearts and that which we feel you've laid upon our hearts to minister. We ask for your strength, the strength of the Holy Spirit, God, tonight, Lord, to minister your word. Bless it now, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Remember Mike and Grace. They're not feeling so well tonight, so we want to remember them in prayer. Amen. And of course, Brother Glenn, he is taking a little bit longer to recoup. Amen. He's pretty young man yet, so hopefully it won't take long, but Amen. We are uh amen thankful for the progress that he's had but amen some of times that is really amen he can hang on pretty hard. Amen. And so we just pray the Lord will rebuke that sickness and that he would amen come back to church chipper and with a big smile as he always has. Amen. Praise the Lord. Turn your Bibles if you you will to Romans the first chapter. Romans 1. Romans 1 verse 20. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead, so that they are without excuse. Now turn, if you will me, to the book of Luke, Luke 14. Amen. This is a quote that I didn't get to Sunday. off that quote that I didn't get to. We just want to kind of kind of continue. Amen. And take and see what the Lord will have for us. Amen. This could also be part two to the message that we preached about a week ago on arrived. Arrived. Amen. Luke chapter 14 verse 15 it says the parable about heaven's banquet and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall sit sit and eat bread shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. Then he said he unto him, a certain man, made a great supper, and bade many, and his and sent his servants at supper time to say to them that were bidden, come for all things are now ready. And they all with one consent began to make excuse. And the first one said, I have bought a piece of ground. I must need go and see it. I pray thee have me excused. Another one said, I have bought five yolk of oxen, and I must go and prove them. I pray thee have me excused. Another one said, I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come. So that servant came and showed his lord the things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servants, "Go out quickly into the streets into the lanes in the city and bring either the poor, the maim, the halt, the blind." And the servant said, "Lord, it is done as thou has commanded, and yet there is room." And the Lord said unto the servant, "Go into the highways and the hedges, and compel them to come in that my house may be filled. For I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word tonight. You can be seated. Tonight's title is going to be no excuses. No excuses. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Bram says, "Brother, one of these days the last Holy Ghost anointed gospel sermon will be preached. One of these days the last gun will fire. One of these days the last song will be sung. One of these days the last prayer will be prayed. One of these days the doors of the tabernacle will be closed for the last time. The Bible will be closed on the pulpit and you'll stand in the presence of God to give an account for what you've heard tonight. What then? What then? When the great book is open, what then? When tonight comes on record, what then? As the song says, what then? When the great book is open, what then? When the ones that's rejected the Savior today will be asked to give a reason. What then? But Abam says, "Your job stood in the in your way. Your parents stood in your way. Your boyfriend stood in your way. Your girlfriend stood in your way. Or your church stood in the way." And then Brother Brandon preached the whole thing again. And he only this time he says message. When the ones that's rejected this message tonight, you're going to be asked to give a reason. To give a reason. &gt;&gt; What then? Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we're just living in that day and happy to be a Christian. Oh my. What could I do? I believe I'd go wild if I wasn't a Christian looking at the thing. I don't see how people can stand it. I just don't understand how a man can walk on earth today without being a Christian. I wish anybody would give me a reason, some reason why not to serve Christ. You can't give a sensible reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, now why? That's the question. There's no one has a better right to ask it than God. Y'all remember the message called why? Amen. Talking about why is the daughter of my people not healed? Is there no D bomb in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Amen. God asks why. In other words, give me a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me a reason. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And he asked in it in the next test text he says tonight if God was if God makes a way of escape for the people to escape a horrible thing or sickness or death or eternal death and then the people fail to receive receive it. God asks why why didn't you do it? Now, that's going to be a great thing on the day of judgment when God is going to ask we tonight that's assembled here that will not accept him as our savior and be filled with his spirit. Why didn't you do it? Why? And we're going to have to give an answer for it. That's right. We're going to answer for every word that God has written. Why didn't you? Why? and listens. And you'll have no excuses &gt;&gt; on that day. &gt;&gt; You'll have no excuses on that day. You know, I was thinking about no excuses. No excuses. And I I really wanted to pull that quote up where brother Bam talked about over in uh foreign lands. And you all remember when he went over there and how it they would go by and I guess he called them salamanders or almost like a dump truck and they would pick out pick up all the dead bodies of bums and so forth that were on the street and they would throw them in that salamander. You'd never see them again. There was no prayer. There was no funerals that right? No. No. No. And he says he says and here we are in America fussing about doctrines and this that or the other. our little petty stuff when there's thousands and tens of thousands of people dying never hearing John 3:16 never hearing about the Savior. Ain't that right? And I thought I would ask if there was one excuse not to accept God, can somebody tell me what that would be? &gt;&gt; That's the only excuse, brother David. The only excuse that I could think of and only God will be the judge on that day is if you never heard the story, you never heard the gospel. &gt;&gt; How many knows then? Yeah, maybe you'd have an excuse because brother Bam said God is obligated to give everybody at least one chance. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And God will be the judge of that. But if you've ever heard the story, Amen. Oh my. If I was President Trump up here tonight, y'all would have ears to hear. We We listen to what the man's got to say. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Or the king of England or any great man. We You listen to what he's got to say. But do you realize the preacher preaching the word of God, it is a whole lot more authority than what any man could ever say. Amen. &gt;&gt; And people listening out there streaming, if they hear this one time that Jesus Christ died for you on Calvary, so you don't have to be lost. If that crosses your ears, that's all God's obligated, that one time. And you will give an account for what you have heard on that day. &gt;&gt; You'll be asked to give a reason why what is. In other words, he's asking for your excuse. He's going to ask what excuse do you have or what reason? What's the reason for you not accepting the Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; And that reason is the excuse. &gt;&gt; Wow. Right. So, everybody will be asked a reason why. My my my and this excuse thing goes a long way with us. Amen. because we who know a lot are accountable for a lot. &gt;&gt; And so I want to try to cover this vastly scope of it a little bit and then perhaps try to get it down a little bit more about where we live at and why we make excuses. Amen. Sometimes we make excuses. &gt;&gt; People that don't come to church on Wednesday, you made an excuse for yourself. &gt;&gt; You had some reason. There was a reason why you didn't come when the doors were open. &gt;&gt; True. said, "But if you really got God on the inside, you can't wait for them to What's your excuse?" &gt;&gt; What's your reason? &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you your reason after a while. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Sunday, I talked about as old folks how that we were get up to 60, 70, 80 years old. You know, we're about done. And I didn't mean necessarily we're about gone, even though we are. [Laughter] I didn't know if I got old folks mad or not, but I'm in 63, so I'm in that category, so I don't really care. I'm talking about myself. If you don't like it, that's just bad. But done as in the Lord working on you. Amen. We sing that song. How does it go? Don't judge me. God isn't finished with me yet. How many believe God's still working on me? &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll always be working on me, but we're wanting God to come down closer to the finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. Getting done with you. Amen. We ought to be like we was 20 years ago. We ought to act like we did it 20 and 30 and 40 and 50. &gt;&gt; Some of us ain't even 50 yet. He ain't even acting like a 50 year old yet. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Young people, aren't you glad to be happy? Glad to be happy. Young, I can't even remember to talk right think. Thank God if you can think right. Amen. God is good, isn't he? All right. So, we look at this and we realize that God has made every provision for man. He has given us when he said it is finished on Calvary. come knows that everything you ever have need of, it doesn't matter what we, everything that you have need of was provided then. It was paid for. &gt;&gt; So, it's no more God's fault. He did his part. Now, we have to do ours. &gt;&gt; And we will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Aren't you glad that judgment begins at the house of God? &gt;&gt; And you'll have to give a reason here for the way that you do things. or you'll have to give a reason over there for the way that you do things. Sooner or later, you will have to give an account for the way that you do things and why you do things and why you didn't do things. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought, you know, we say that a judgment day that every wrong will be made right. Isn't that right? Can you imagine? There's not a murder. There is nothing. There is not Oh my, here we go. There's not even any idle word that a man can speak but what you give an account for. In other words, he'll gonna make all the wrongs right. You mean he's going to righten this whole thing? Yeah. Yeah. See the judges, they ain't no they don't bring justice. But this God, he will bring justice. He will make the wrongs right. Ain't nobody getting away with nothing. &gt;&gt; So you can judge yourself here. I love where brother says you are your own judge. God don't judge you. God don't send you to hell. You are here. Amen. And you judge yourself whether you're worthy or not. &gt;&gt; You are your own judge. &gt;&gt; You send yourself to hell or heaven. &gt;&gt; By thy words, thou shalt be condemned or thou shalt be saved. Whatever you confess, thank the Lord for water and a cool fan. Amen. I like that little thing. Praise the Lord. All right. I love that. Think about it. How many knows that the whole world and everybody that hears the gospel, Amen, is forced to a decision. Even the prophet of God said the decision is forced upon people. You have to make a choice. Once it comes to your ear, once you hear it, you become responsible for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would we not accept it? Oh my. Let me don't go down this rabbit hole, but I'm here to tell you right now, how many is glad to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be a Christian. I'm with the prophet of God. How could you go through this world, Amen, knowing that just any time the nukes could go up into the air? Amen. This thing could be obliterated. There's no hopes for this world. Amen. They don't have no peace. You wouldn't have no peace. You wouldn't have no joy if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I thank God that he saved me and that he called me and that we received Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's check out this reason. Praise the Lord. You know even uh Jesus I believe it was he asked the disciples one time he says who do men say that I the son of man am and they oh say some Elias some Isaiah or this different prophets or they say this one or that one but who who do you say that I am &gt;&gt; I mean I was they had to make a choice of who they thought it was &gt;&gt; what do you think of this tell me a reason give me a reason and who you Who think it? Who do you think it was? How many knows that even some of them thought it was Beelzebub? They judged him as Beelzebub because they had to make a choice on what they thought it was. And then once they're faced with the truth, Jesus says, "Unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your unbelief. You will die in your sins." Another one time they were asking him a bunch of question. He says John's ministry, he said, "What was it of? Was it of God or was it of man?" And they dare not ask him the answer because if they say that it was of man, amen, the people are going to say, "No, no, no, no. John was of God." &gt;&gt; And then if they say John was of God, then they didn't repent. Then they condemned themselves. So they say, "We can't answer. Neither will I answer you." He said, &gt;&gt; "Put him on the spot. make a choice. How many believes that I don't know if you can do it, but zoom in over here, will you with the camera? How many believe that in this generation it's the same thing? People have to decide what do you think of this? &gt;&gt; Make your choice. Do you think that's a fake pillar of fire on his head? Do you think he's a false prophet? Do you really believe the story? That's that the only picture that was came out of many out of a critic's camera &gt;&gt; and that's the actual pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; What do you believe? Do you believe this message is of God or do you believe it's of man? &gt;&gt; Make a choice cuz God's going to ask you what you did with it one day. &gt;&gt; And he'll ask you why that you made the choice that you did. Because there'll be a lot of people giving all kinds of excuses on the judgment day. Well, my church didn't teach that. Well, I just don't believe that. That's not according to my faith. &gt;&gt; And it ain't going to bear well water. He going to hold wo water. Hello. It's going to not going to be a good enough excuse. God came and he proved it over and over and over and over again. so that they are without excuse. Amen. Praise be to God. In another instance, he talks about certain scribes of the f and the Pharisees answered saying, "Master, we would see a sign from thee." Amen. And he answered and said unto them, "An evil and adulter evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall be no sign given it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. For as Jonas was in the days of uh in three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." Really, I could have just went to 41. The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas. And behold, a greater than Jonas is here. Can you imagine the men of Nineveh? They're going to rise in judgment. Say, "Why didn't you believe him? All we had is a man coming out of a fish's mouth and we believed him. But here you had a man raising the dead, healing the sick, and you wouldn't believe. You a bunch of stubborn hardheaded people. How many of people are hard-headed, stiff necked? Stephen said, "Oh, you stiff necked and uncircumcised of harden the earth. How you resist the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; They took up stones and stones, Stephen. Don't you think they're going to have to give an answer? Why did they do it? We did it because we were jealous." Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter how righteous they thought that they were, they'll be asked to give a reason. What's your excuse? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about the rich young man story? Man, people prosper and prosper and money becomes their god. &gt;&gt; Hello. And he give the story of him being in hell. Then you're find your soul lifted up and Amen. and his love was with his money, with his prosperity. Nothing wrong with that if God blesses you in that way. But make sure it doesn't get you between you and God. &gt;&gt; Or it's an idol and it's evil. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So many stories we we have no excuse. How many know we have no excuse? The world don't have an excuse. &gt;&gt; Don't give God no excuse. Or should I say, don't give God no excuse. No, I think it ought to be yelled just a little bit. Why? If you want to be so hard-hearted, you won't receive God, won't accept Christ and what he did after what he did for you on Calvary. We as Christians, there's one thing for sure. People can go out there on the streets and they can mock Christ. I don't know if y'all watched YouTube any, but Azie Osborne died not so long ago, the prince of darkness, and they've got him up in heaven here. He ate bats, had dark uh symbols of darkness and everything represented darkness. They've got him up there with doves and clouds and angels. &gt;&gt; You reckon that's where he is? Down here, he's got bats and devils everywhere. And now they got him flying around in the heavens. You talk about deceiving to those who followed. &gt;&gt; Hello. No. My my my. That's right. What I wanted to say is God is not mocked, friends. &gt;&gt; Who knows? God is not mocked. Judgment day, like brother Bam said, that day is coming when the books are open. Amen. So there's another just one of one of different ones. The men of Nine of Queen of Sheba shall rise. Ain't that right? She came from the furthermost parts of the earth, so to speak, to come to hear the wisdom of Solomon to see his discernment. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And he says a greater than Solomon is here. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. And a greater than Solomon is here. When our prophet when he came when he preached a greater than Solomon here, he says a greater than all is here. Christ himself is here doing the very same things again and you'll give an account for that. You'll have to give a reason why you rejected. How many know Brother Bam says these tapes will meet this generation on judgment day. &gt;&gt; That's right. Those quotes, these quotes, the ministry, the preaching, it'll meet this whole generation from the 1900s on at the judgment day. Now read it. I don't know if I could find it real quick or not. Brother Bam says, "I know I've got to stand in the last days at the resurrection with this generation of people and to give an account for this word." And the Holy Spirit showing this to me, preaching out yonder, where are you going to stand? How are you going to get by with it? You can't do it, friend. Amen. That's right. Preaching the word. Nobody's going to get by with anything. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. God is good. Amen. So that's a generational generational call. A generation that's going to give have to give a reason for why they didn't accept the truth of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd like to with the help of the Lord, let's look at oursel a little bit. How many knows a lot of times we make excuses for ourselves? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very easy to make excuses, &gt;&gt; to try to make excuses for things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But a preached a message. It's called What was the Holy Ghost given for? &gt;&gt; What was he given for? Well, let's just look at it for a minute. He says, "I was talking of the power of prayer, the power of speech, the power of a holy life." Amen. That's what the Holy Ghost is to do. Some of you people walking along saying, "I just can't quit &gt;&gt; drinking. I just can't quit this." He said, "The Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make these cats get away from you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many knows if you haven't arrived where you ought to be? I I really wish I could pull that quote up because I remember preaching on it and I know brother Bam mentioned it and even even if he didn't, I could make the statement that why do we wish for things that has been bought and paid for? There's no need for wishing for things anymore. &gt;&gt; I want you to know there's no there's no waiting for things anymore. They had to wait at the day of Pentecost for 11 day. Wait till you're endued with power from on high. But brother Bam says since the Holy Ghost has come, there's not any waiting anymore. You can receive things right there in your seat right now if you really want it. &gt;&gt; And the word can't shouldn't be in our vocabulary. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a word the devil tries to tell you. You can't do it. You can't do it. I know you can't. But if you'll surrender yourself to God, God will do it. Oh my, I'm here to tell you, no, without the Holy Ghost, you can't. But yes, with the Holy Ghost, all things are possible. I'm here to tell you tonight, I believe tonight that what we all need more of is more of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you get the Holy Ghost, you'll act like the Holy Ghost. You'll follow the Holy Ghost. You'll do what the Holy Ghost says. And if you're not, if you're not doing it, then you ain't got the Holy Ghost the way you ought to have. &gt;&gt; You're still making excuses for yourself. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm going to talk to everybody tonight and including myself for sure. Hello. Oh my. This is a quote I didn't get to Sunday. So, this is where we'll take off. Can't quit drinking. These can'ts get away from you. That's right. It'll make women stop cutting their hair. &gt;&gt; Men, quit wearing shorts and slacks. No excuses, Brother Ram says. Don't give me no excuse. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just struggled with that. You're just not dead to yourself yet. &gt;&gt; You're just not surrendered yet like you ought to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Make them quit wearing shorts. No excuses. Make them quit paddling. Brother Brandon tries to cover it all. &gt;&gt; Hello. How many know the Holy Ghost will make you watch your tongue? &gt;&gt; You know, I just had a thought today and I might as well share it with you since it comes to my mind. But tattling and gossiping and causing divisions in a church, I think that is one of the worst, most sinful, deadly, deadly, devilish things that we can do. It &gt;&gt; I I I I'm not going to categorize it, but if you my own personal opinion, and maybe I shouldn't give my opinion, but it's probably worse than adultery or anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. That might be between two people, but when somebody comes and does like what the devil did up in heaven and took twothirds of the angels and divided heaven up, God never did forgive him. He's going straight to hell. And God hates division. God hates people that bring division and things. &gt;&gt; Hello. It's a terrible thing to do. That's why people better watch their mouth. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing. &gt;&gt; Quit tattling. That's what it's for, to make you live a holy life. It'll follow the instructions of the Bible every time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Women say it's just too hot. How many know it's an excuse? Amen. We sing that song, excuses, excuses. You hear them every day. Go to church. The preacher's just way too quiet or he's way too loud. Music's too soft or it's too loud. It's too hot or it's too cold. &gt;&gt; I might as well just preach. people quit church, go home. And all the other excuses was, "And there's too many hypocrites in hell in the church. That's why I didn't go to church. Somebody hurt my feelings." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "Oh, so you're hiding behind a hypocrite. You little hider. &gt;&gt; You little excuse maker." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on, folks. There not going to be no excuses. Amen. &gt;&gt; Weak. Weak. Can't have nobody say something about you without you throwing a fit. &gt;&gt; Without going and praying for him like you ought to &gt;&gt; can't take nothing. Brother Phil, people can't take nothing. &gt;&gt; I hope Gillum don't mind. We was painting away on his house and he said, "Dad," because I was telling him, he said, "You got to be patient, Dad." And I says I said patience is just not part of my DNA, Caleb. All my life I've worked hard and fast and it's so hard for me to have patience. He said, "You just don't have patience." I said, "Son," I said, "I don't know so much about that. I've went through some hard times and I've had to have a lot of patience through it. So, I've got a little patience." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I could just get it in every area of my life now, maybe we'd be all right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, he goes on, listen. Oh, too hot to where it gives me a headache if I let my hair grow, but there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's uh it's here to make it so. I like that. Don't you? It makes it so. It's got hair on its chest. It don't tally down. It's Oh, I wish. David didn't wish the giant would fall. He says, "Where's my sling? Let me add him." That's what the Holy Ghost will do. Everybody else will cower down. Oh, I'm scared. Don't get scared. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll follow the word just exactly. How many believe that? That's what the Holy Ghost is to do. It's to make you man turn your head from them half naked women and quit lusting after them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. A church member, it'll do that. It's to cause you to quit quit making you quit smoke, quit drink, quit wanting to be a big shot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It'll take all of that out of you. It'll humble you when you do that. That's what the Holy Ghost is for. It's for a holy life. Make you quit gossiping. make you quit playing cards, shooting craps, and all these other things that you do around the corner. &gt;&gt; How many knows that if you really got the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost convicts you of those little things that you do wrong? &gt;&gt; Don't think the Holy Ghost don't tell you. He does. He does me. I know the voice of the Holy Ghost. I know what he tells me. Now, you ought to do this and ought to do that. You know what it you know what it's like some too at times to ignore that and your flesh wants to do the opposite. Hello. And that's where we get in our troubles is we don't listen to the Holy Ghost and he gives us all kinds of excuses &gt;&gt; but it's all nothing but an excuse. I mean believe the Holy Ghost will tell you if you really got the Holy Ghost. I thought today I said boy oh boy. I'll tell you what what we need. We need We need young people that's got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It'll make you love your parents. It'll make you obey your parents. It'll make you a good teenager. &gt;&gt; Parents, you're in for a real treat if your children get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They'll be sensitive. They'll apologize. They won't want to do things wrong. Young people, let me tell you something. You're a blessed person if your parents get the Holy Ghost. If they got the Holy Ghost, I want to say want to say they won't half beat you to death. But brother Bland really didn't put it that way. [Laughter] Take a barrel slap. There was it teenage daughter out there doing he wouldn't walk for a week or something like that. Ain't that right? I can't imagine all that. Why? But they got such a love for you. It's better to half kill you than to have you kill yourself with your disobedience and going out into the world and getting into drugs getting killed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'll tell it again. We had a big old paint stick and we put two big old five gallon buckets paint stick. Oh, by the way, I've got a bunch of them if you parents need any. We got a bunch of buckets of that paint and they gave me way more sticks than I need. Amen. Tape them together. Good. Amen. And write on there like we did soul saver. Why? Because the Bible said that's a soul save his soul. The soul saver, right? But by God's grace, if you got the Holy Ghost, hopefully, you know what, kids, let me just give you a little trick on how to get out of weapons. How many would like to get out of weapons? &gt;&gt; None of their hands were up. Well, parents, you've seen it. No, get the Holy Ghost and you won't do things that you ought to do. &gt;&gt; They won't have to whip you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? That's certainly not in my notes, but it's totally free. Didn't cost any extra. You didn't even have to give me a tip. We're all right. Amen. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, listen what he says here. That's right. Let me see where we're at. Make you doing all this stuff. I'm true to your wife. Make you want to quit marrying somebody else's wife. That's right. That's what it is. It's to make you live a holy life. That's what the Holy Ghost power is for. It's to set your affections on things above where God stands at the right hand of God. Amen. Let this mind be in you. And you say, "Well, I just can't do it." Oh, I just can't do it. Sure you can. But the Holy Ghost come for that purpose. That's what it did. It came to take that out of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe that? Well, we get the Holy Ghost. Amen. When we come to church, Amen. Sometimes, and I was thinking, you know, that when we come to church and we have a service, it's like pulling a wagon. Amen. I'm not sure who it was anymore, but some preachers uh he they were two preachers always went with each other and one would scotch for the other. One would scotch for the other. Scotching means a wagon goes forward and you put a little scotch on it, you know. Amen, brother. Amen. Amen. Amen. Get him up over there. And one time that brother, he just didn't Amen. Amen at all. And he flowed and he just had a hard time. Amen. A and the brother asked him, "Why didn't you scotch for me?" Have you heard this one? Why didn't you scotch for me? He says, 'Well, you never move forward. You never move forward. But let me say this, it's like pushing the wagon up and I'm pulling and I'm pulling. Amen. And if you get the Holy Ghost, you'll help pull, too. Amen. How many believe we all got to pull a little? Amen. It'll make you say, "Amen. Preach it, Brother Bo. Preach it, Brother Brad. Let's pull this thing. Cuz I'm here to tell you the atmosphere of every prayer service that we come to. Amen. We sometimes I don't understand why it's not the same. Sometimes why it seems like you're plowing the whole way, pushing the whole way. And how many believe it ought to really not be that way. &gt;&gt; There should be no hindering spirit here. &gt;&gt; There should be nobody sitting with a critical attitude. And sometimes them things cause the church to fail. It causes a pullback. And we need to come prayed up. Come 30 minutes early. Pray at home. Pray wherever. But come prepared and saying, "God, we're going to pull." &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz we got the preacher to preach and let him get out of the way. Amen. Get this little wagon up over the hill going down the other side. Amen. And then everybody hang on cuz we're cruising now. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many wants to get up over the other side and say, "Oh boy, this is hold, you know, hold back almost because we're going to pump the roof off here if we don't watch it. &gt;&gt; This wagon's going to get away from us." But it ought to be easy. How many believe we ought to be in heavenly places in Christ Jesus? &gt;&gt; We're gathered in heavenly places, but the Holy Ghost comes to take those can'ts out of you. Get it away from you. Yes, you can do it. Why? because you're letting the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; do it through you. &gt;&gt; You've surrendered yourself. Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to talk about why we make excuses, why we make excuses, and then how we can overcome making those excuses, not be at the place where we make excuses. How's that sound? Sound like a lesson for this Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; All right. Praise the Lord. That good Chick-fil-A. Them chicken strips are all for good. Kelly brought us some home. How many likes them? Pretty good. make you drink water. But anyway, that's all right. So now notice he says, "You say you just can't do it." Sure, you can't. But the Holy Ghost come for that p purpose. Amen. So that you don't just have excuses, but so that you could do it. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? No excuses. That's what it did. It come to take it all that all that out of you. all of them old habits and things that you're doing. Amen. That old backbiting, separating self saying, "Bless God, I'm a Methodist." This that or the other, I won't have nothing to do with this one or that one. Come on, folks. He said, "As long as we have the Holy Ghost, we should be a unified group." How many believe that? It's to give uncction to a preacher. It's to give holiness to a group. It's to set the church in order. It's to bring unity of spirit to unite us together with power. It's get unite us together with love, brotherly love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, now look, this is what is the Holy Ghost for given for towards the end of this. Now, people look at me in the face. A lot of hands went up that you had the Holy Ghost. Amen. Now, I'm I'm just going to bounce for just a little bit. He said another place he said he's been kind of holding it back. Kind of holding it back. Trying not to be too hard on the people. Amen. But he just wants to let it go. He want He really wanted to let it go. Now, I'm just going to bounce here just a little bit here. This is taped, but we're going to get more of it tomorrow night. He says, "If you say that you're guilty of these things, I wonder what's leading you." God will never lead you away from the word. He'll keep you with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, you say, "It don't harm me to do this and that." It doesn't. If the word says it, if the Holy Spirit is in you, it'll lead you to the right way, to the right word. And there will be no excuses. No excuses. Amen. God don't make alterations or excuses. He makes the mark and you tow it. That's all. That's what it is with everyone. You come the same way. Amen. Now, I don't mean to hurt you. I love you too much. But brother, sister, do you realize that I've got to stand in the last day at the resurrection with this generation of people and give an account for this word? The Holy Spirit showing this and me preaching out yonder, where are you going to stand? How are you going to get by with it? You can't do it, friend. So now stop that. Whatever you're doing wrong, stop it. How many believe that goes for me, that goes for every one of us. Whatever you're doing that you know you shouldn't do, stop it. &gt;&gt; Repent. &gt;&gt; Now, if I was a prophet of God, the angel of the Lord come down here, I could go down through here and I tell you where every one of your faults, where every one of your failures is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Sure, he could could discern, but I am not. But you know what? How many is with me tonight? If you'll listen real close, the Holy Spirit will talk to you. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope none of you is doing anything wrong anywhere. Huh? I really hope so. &gt;&gt; But most of us will probably have to say, "He's not finished with me yet." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to take it as from the Lord bringing it back to my mind here because I started with the children. But how many knows we need parents that are Holy Ghost fil? &gt;&gt; We need marriages. We need families and our marriages, husbands and wives and that love each other, &gt;&gt; that get along with each other. Amen. Me and my wife, we've been getting together a long time. And I'm still learning how to treat her. I'm still learning how to be a a better husband. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And I didn't say it, but you let your husband get the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and you're in for a treat, honey. Well, I shouldn't call you honey. I only got one, honey. [Laughter] Wife, you are in for a good time. That's right. In the same way, if the wife gets a Holy Ghost, husbands, you're in for a treat because why? That Christianity is going to reflect right there. How many believes that shows it? &gt;&gt; Amen. We need strong relationships of husbands and wives, children. Amen. Brothers and sisters, that's what the Holy Ghost came for. to bring unity, to bring love, strong marriages. It'll make a husband treat his wife right, understanding, loving. Should I just say what comes to my mind? And remember, husband, you're the head. You're the leader in all this. Don't expect her to do the leading. I don't care if she yells at you, screams at you, tries to smack you, and you got to dodge. You're going to have to learn how to tame all that. You're going to have to learn to get her to where she don't act like that. Where she don't have to act like that, because her chances are probably pretty high you cause it in the first place. I said that a little quietly to save us fellas. But you heard me. I guess how many believes that's what I what I have told you is the truth. That husbands and wives, let them get the Holy Ghost the way they're supposed to have it. And you're going to act the way the Holy Spirit is going to act. &gt;&gt; You're going to have his reactions. You're going to have his thoughts. You're going to have his kindness. You're going to have his patience, patience, and longsuffering. You're going to have his gentleness. I don't care if you're a mountain man burly and and mountain men are mean and mountain men are rough and mountain men are low down but let them get the Holy Ghost one time and they'll become unmean gentle and meek and kind. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's what the Holy Ghost is for. Don't give no excuses. Amen. We shouldn't have to. And I I certainly don't believe in just preaching and just telling you the stories of baseball games and people pulling hats down how they worship just to get you excited &gt;&gt; and just to make you worship. But I'm here to tell you when the word comes forth that's worth worshiping about, I mean, I believe we ought to give God a little worship. &gt;&gt; And I don't believe we ought to have the preachers ought to have to pull the worship out of you. No, it ought to be there already, y'all. They come automatically. &gt;&gt; Amen. People, the song leaders, they shouldn't have to come. Come on now, y'all. Help me out here. I can't barely hear anybody. Nobody think shouldn't have to do that. No, we should come with a heart full of joy. &gt;&gt; We ought to be tuned up. We ought to have our lamps trimmed. &gt;&gt; Amen. The foolish virgin merchants, they're going to have an excuse. Well, our oil ran out. Huh? That's going to be their excuse. Why did you let your oil run out? Well, I'll tell you why. I can tell you why. Because they let the things of the world take over. Amen. And it choked out the light that was in them and people drift off. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Where are we? So he says, "I just can't." That's right. the old habits, backbiting and so forth, separating yourself. I already had that one. Okay, one more page before we get to the last one. We're running pretty good on schedule. All right. So, I'll stand before that generation and give an account out yonder. Where are you going to stand? So, whatever you're doing, stop it. Say you can't. You say you can't. Then you haven't got the caner in you or the caner. Amen. How many please? We got to have that one that can do it. Oh, how many know that's not me? That's not the flesh. That's the Holy Ghost. That's not you, but that's the Holy Ghost. How many say I the Holy Ghost can do it? &gt;&gt; He's He's the caner. Amen. When the Holy Ghost comes, he gives you power over the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen. He says if you love the world or things of the world, it's because the love of God isn't in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just want to pray for Carson here at the end of the service, but if we want to say to him just before we go, Amen. It's quite a world out there. I don't know just how it is. You're going to find out how it is. But there's one thing that's going to cause you to be able to overcome that. And to be an overcomer, it's going to be the faith that you have in Jesus Christ. Because this is the victory that overcomes the world, even your faith. Amen. People will question it and make you doubt it and everything else, but if you are grounded in that faith, you'll overcome the world. Praise the Lord. So, why is it sometimes that we have excuses or make excuses? It's because of this. Amen. A lot of times it's because of our lack of prayer. Hello. Our lack of closeness to God. &gt;&gt; Now, I like this quote to better explain it. Brother Bandon was talking about he says, "Can you imagine talking about exhausting God's love?" Well, okay. Exhausting God's love and power and beneficiaries for you. Can you imagine a little bitty fish about that long way out there in the middle of the ocean saying, "Now, wait a minute. I better consider this thing. I better drink of this water sparingly. I mean, no. He said, we've got we've got an ocean. &gt;&gt; We've got an ocean. We've got all 1100 tape. We got the book. We've got the vindication. We've got all the water that you need. &gt;&gt; You ain't got to worry about drinking sparingly. But one of the problems is why we come with excuses is because amen the the cares of life choke out our time to pray. We ain't got time to pray. We ain't got time to read. &gt;&gt; We ain't got time to listen to a preacher brother Brandon everything. And that hurts us. &gt;&gt; You're drinking too sparingly. You're a little fish in the ocean getting skinny cuz you're not eating the way you should and drinking the way that you should. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says, "Well, that could easily be done more easier than you could ever ask too much of God." How many knows? He says, "The Bible says you ask not because you believe not. You receive not because you ask not." So, how many believes you got to ask? You got to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever we have need of, ask him and believe it. He provided in every redemptive blessing that he died for at Calvary. and he gave a promise to you for everything that you have need of while on life's journey. It's yours if you'll believe. Or could you imagine the little mouse about that long in the gardeners of Egypt way down there at the bottom mine at the very bottom and saying, "Look, I better take my little bag and I'm going to go over here and store it over here in my house because I might run out." You don't have to worry about running out. It's probably I don't know how long mice live, seven years, five years. Amen. But you got enough to last you a lifetime. Amen. You can eat until you look like roly pololy and you can stay fat and sassy. How many believe I'll tell you what you can drink and drink. We've got waters to drink. &gt;&gt; And I thought, man, what we need is Christians with a spiritual drinking problem. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Folks, we're so caught up with the cares of life, we don't drink enough. People have drinking problems. They drink all the time. Can't help themselves. Walking around drunk. Alcoholics. Well, we need spiritual alcoholics. &gt;&gt; Just drinking all the time. &gt;&gt; How y'all doing? Just get a little spiritually drunk once in a while. Hello. &gt;&gt; Get so full of the Holy Ghost till you stagger like drunk people. &gt;&gt; We ain't done that in a while, have we? That's right. Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; I want to do it. I want to drink more of it. &gt;&gt; Maybe we drink sparingly. We get come to church and I'll tell you what, it's so dry. We got to go somewhere else to some church that's lively. Huh? Excuses. &gt;&gt; Excuses. &gt;&gt; Amen. Got to drink more. I got to drink more. Brother Brad, we got to drink more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Like the Bible says, I've repeated it many times. Amen. Let your soul delight itself in fatness. Come drink, buy wine, and all. That's right. Without money, without price. We ought to be happy about that. You don't have to do anything about it. You ain't You You didn't have to pay the price at Calvary. You didn't have to let them beat you to death, drag you up on a stick, and put snails in your hand, &gt;&gt; crucify you. No, he did it for you. He paid for all of it. It ought to make us happy to know it's without money. It's without price. It's free. If you don't drink, if you don't eat, don't blame him. Amen. Well, that church is too dry. You know what that is? That's a complaint. That's whining. &gt;&gt; That's spiritual starvation. Cuz you if you wouldn't do that, you wouldn't worry about everybody else. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You'd make sure that you're in the spirit the way you ought to be in the spirit. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Couple of things we want to talk about. The reason why and then how to get over it. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; I just thought of these quotes. I said, you know, this is part of the reasons why we a lot of times we get to complain and murmur. Brother, many illustrations talked about a a cactus or those plants out in the west. I don't know much about it. I just take his word for it. But he says it's so dry until their leaves coil up and they become stickers. Is that right? And if you touch against them, ow ow ow. It's the way some people are get around them and they're complaining about this and that and the other and you go away feeling like that was sticky. &gt;&gt; Boy, that wasn't very comfortable at all. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because somebody's so spiritually dry. All they can do is sit around the table and talk about somebody. Talk bad about somebody. &gt;&gt; You spiritual deprived demon. Hello. &gt;&gt; That's nothing but a complaining devil. But you get water, those sneakers unroll and they become beautiful leaves. Ain't that right? They become soft, not sticky. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, did you know somebody said this about you? Ah, they didn't mean it. Soft and gentle and flexible. &gt;&gt; But if you still sinky, somebody said that. Oh, I'll get them. Where? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, folks. &gt;&gt; That's right. Excuses. Remember, there's no excuse. There's no excuse why we shouldn't possess the things that we desire. There is no excuse to not possess the things that we desired. They're bought and paid for. It's waiting on the table for you. Get your fork and dig in. &gt;&gt; Come and dine. Ain't that right? He called them. Come on. Come on. Dinner's ready. Everything's ready. All you got to do is come. But they made excuse. How how many knows that we human beings, we sure are full of excuses. We make our excuses if we aren't careful. All right. Brother Bam says, "You all are great fruit raisers out here in California. You raise oranges. Did you know that when that little orange tree is just about a half an inch high, that every bushel of oranges that you'll ever pick off of it is in that tree right then? Amen. It's in that tree. Did you know that? Didn't brother Bab says when you get the Holy Ghost, it's maybe about the size of your fingernail or thumbnail one &gt;&gt; and it goes into your heart and it just grows from there. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Folks, I'm here to tell you something. I believe that these quotes are very powerful. &gt;&gt; They're timeless. They don't get old to me. &gt;&gt; I believe they're keys for us to become the kind of Christians that we're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Half an inch. All you got to do and listen and all that you got to do with that little tree is just plant it and then you have to give it water and it just drinks and more than its allotted portion. More it drinks the more it pushes out. I'll just say what comes to mind. You know, brother Bram said that you didn't have to go to church to be saved. Going to church doesn't save you. Can have somebody else tell me what the other half of that is? The other half of that he says church keeps you saved. Church keeps you saved. Why? Because I it would just be great that we got saved. We're in our fullness. We never have our downs. We never have no we're perfect. It's perfect. No, it's that's not how it is. a Christian life, you've got to water it. You've got to feed it. Brother B says, you've got to milk the cow or she'll go dry. You've got to share. You've got to feed on the word or you will die. You come to church to stay alive. Sure, you can get saved in church. Sure, but that's not what saves you. Church itself doesn't save you. Christ does. &gt;&gt; But coming to church is important because uh but because the Holy Ghost will feed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You come to drink and drink and push out. Now, how many knows that you shouldn't just drink here when you're at home, when you're driving down the road? &gt;&gt; I don't know if you experience this or not, but when you're driving the road thinking about the Lord, Amen. You'll his presence will come in there so strong until you begin to think and and and weeping almost because of the presence of the Lord. Presence of the Lord isn't just for in church. It's for everywhere you are. If you really want it, &gt;&gt; just keep drinking. &gt;&gt; So that when you come those doors, you're already fed up. &gt;&gt; We could go preach for a long time talking about the Christian. Amen. Living in that kind of glory is always fed up. Lord help me. I want to stay fed up &gt;&gt; because it's so easy to get distracted because of the cares of this world. Okay, we're going to just jump a little bit. Whenever a believer is placed in Jesus Christ, you're planted in there in the inexhaustible fountain of life. And the more you drink, the more you push out. That's right. Oh, I you might say, I believe that Jesus saves me. That's good. Then how about the Holy Ghost? How about getting filled with the Holy Ghost? You believe the Holy Ghost will fill you? He promised you. Every divine, even divine healing, he promised it to you. Every redemptive blessing belongs to you. All you got to do is drink. How many believe that you've got that on the inside? You already have. Let me just say it the way the prophet is. When you receive the Holy Ghost, everything that you've got need of between here and glory is in you right then. &gt;&gt; It ain't faith you need. You got faith if you got the Holy Ghost. He is your faith. But the thing of know is how to use that faith. If you understand how to use it. Amen. How many believe that? How to use it. All right, we're already a little past time. Okay, seems like I missed something now. How can we not be excuse makers or not be what we might call halfway? Halfway there. Half done. Not quite done. Half done. Amen. How can we really come to that place? I'm just going to read it to you. See, because I don't know about you, but I still see things in my life that God has to work on. &gt;&gt; How about you? &gt;&gt; I mean, if you don't, I want to shake your hand. You know, after church, come up, say, "Brother, [Laughter] now when you shake my hand, you're going to be saying, "No, brother, I'm not perfect." But Amen. All right, I'll leave that alone. Just like you listen, Brother Bam says, "Make uh he says God makes complete Christians. God don't make halfway preachers, but sometimes a preacher can be halfway." God makes his children Christian, I mean Christians, but sometimes they're halfway Christians, but it's not God's intention for them to be that way. Now, what I wanted to bring about this is why sometimes that we are not what we're supposed to be. The bottom line is something I've said many times, but maybe somebody here hasn't heard it before. Listen, it's not God's intention for them to be that way. It's their own ways that got mixed up in the plan of God in their life. How many believe that we are not there yet? Because sometimes there's still some of our self in there. &gt;&gt; We allow our flesh, our feelings, our emotions to make excuses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. to make excuses because there's a mixture there that what makes them that way. Then he says it this way and this is to tell you let you know how that we can and desire to in our hearts to become to the place where God wants us to be. He says, "And a member of that church, if he's called to be a member of this certain group, then if he would not compromise, if the church believes that he should not gamble, then that member should never touch a deck of cards. We don't believe in drinking, he should turn his head completely from drinking. If we do not believe in gambling or smoking, the member of this church should never touch a thing like that." God gives complete deliverance. How many believe that? and he will do it if we'll completely surrender our life. &gt;&gt; That's the key. That's the key. &gt;&gt; I I I could name names of people that I see in here that are more surrendered that they were a year ago. &gt;&gt; You can tell by their action. They're more surrendered. We're still doing things contrary to the word of God. That area is still not surrendered. &gt;&gt; And that's where our problems is. Lord, help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Abraham gives us a secret. If we will completely surrender ourselves to him, then if we will completely deliver ourselves into his hands, then God can live in us. Christ the hope of glory. He can reflect himself from us as we get ourselves out of the way. Then our thoughts become his thoughts. Amen. Can you imagine Christ smoking a cigar, sitting down having a whiskey, as I put it, and playing some doing some gambling. Amen. Christ playing cards and so forth. Then if your spirit is part of his spirit, he wants it to be upon your profession. But you permit the devil to come in and take over. And all the time in your heart, way down deep, you know that you're doing those things that are wrong. Now, I'm just going to read this. I don't think anybody here is doing any of this, but I'm going to read it against anyway, just in case. And when one member would talk against another member, you know that's wrong. You're commanded to pray for one another. Not talk against each other, but to love one another. And if someone is down, let's pick him up, help him. Amen. That's what makes us a unified group together. I mean, how many knows even brother Bam had to fight the thing? Amen. So, my punchline is right there. If we can completely ourselves surrender ourselves. So those listening, those here present, myself, if you want to be a complete Christian, then ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you what areas of your life is not surrendered yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's not surrendered, And I want to ask you this. All those that feel like there's still areas of your life that you need to surrender and you say, "Lord, I want I want to show I want you to show me every bad place in my life." Amen. I thank God for the places he shows me where I'm wrong and where I'm bad. Amen. Where I'm off. Amen. And you do the same. and you want to surrender your life to God just now, stand up. Say, "Lord, I want to completely surrender to you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to completely surrender to you." Raise your hands in surrenderance because raising your hands is a sign, universal sign of surrender. Lord Jesus, we come before you tonight, Lord. And Father, we don't ever want to try to make excuses for our bad places, for our wrong. We want you to come, Lord, to cleanse us from all evil, from all unrighteousness. Lord, we want to see your reflection in our lives. Lord, we ask, Lord Jesus, that we wouldn't allow the devil to talk to our hearts, to our minds, and try to give an excuse for us to do things that's contrary to what you've said. Lord, your prophet has come. He's given us a ministry that is going to perfect the bride, that he's going to have a church ready for the rapture. And I believe there's this group right here, Father, is part of that. Lord, we ask God that you would take every hand now that's up. And Lord, discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart right now. You know what they're thinking. You know what they're confessing. You know what they're saying. I surrender this to you, Lord. I surrender that. Whatever it is, Father, I pray Lord that tomorrow morning when they wake up, they'll wake up and they will not be the same as what they were when they woke up this morning. They'll have changed because they have more fully surrendered to you, Lord. And father, help them Lord to have greater joy, greater peace, more of your Holy Spirit to talk to them in a louder, planer voice to do things that you want them to do. Go places that you want them to go. Encourage people that you want them to encourage. Help people that you want them to help to for all of us, Lord, to help us to do the right thing in every aspect of our life. Forgive us of where we fail, Lord Jesus. For we certainly are failures, Lord. But we know that if we have your Holy Spirit, it's got the power for us to overcome all un unrighteousness and unbelief. Take these hands, take these hearts beneath these hands now, Lord, and receive them and fill them with a greater portion of you. Fill them with a greater portion of the Holy Ghost, Father, so that we could be led by the Holy Ghost. in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. God bless you. Brother Carson, if you want to come up, we want to pray with you. Ask his blessing as he goes off to college. You want to say anything or no? Amen. He's going off to college. How many knows he he needs the power of the Holy Spirit? He needs the power of all of our prayers. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. And we believe God's going to give him that power. that strength to overcome the enemy and to shine bright, Carson. Shine bright. Amen. Wear a smile. Amen. Make people ask, "Why are you so happy, Carson? What do you got?" Amen. And you'll know you're living your life the kind of right of life when they say, "I want what you got." Amen. Hopefully, there will be somebody there like that that'll actually want the joy that he has, the peace that he has, the God that he has, the faith that he has. Amen. When they see his firm stand for the truth, for the word. Amen. All right, let's all pray. Heavenly Father, we come before you tonight, Lord. Lord, in this young man whom we've watched, Lord, grow up, Father, go through high school, Lord Jesus. And Lord, and all the things, Lord, that he's went through, but Lord, now he gone off to college to get a degree. And I'm not just sure what it is, Lord. But I pray that you would bless him in his efforts, Lord, and in his endeavor, Lord Jesus. We ask, God, that he'd always put you first, Lord Jesus. That you'd be first in his life, Father, in his prayer life, Lord, in his reading of the Bible, Lord Jesus. listening to your prophet. We ask God that his life would reflect Jesus Christ, Lord, to those other people that are out there, Lord. Maybe get some saved. That would be wonderful, Lord Jesus. Lead some to Christ, Father. And I pray, God, for your protection against the enemy that would cry to come in perhaps, perhaps try to make him question his faith. But Lord, help him to be unwavering, steadfast, sound in the gospel, Lord Jesus. And give him, Lord Jesus, the love of God in his heart to shed abroad that others would see the reflection of Christ in him. We ask for your safety and for your blessing upon him now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. God bless you. God bless you. [Music] Amen. Praise. How many loves the Lord? Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand for his presence tonight. God bless you. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. [Music] And it's the more that I surrender, the lighter my load.
