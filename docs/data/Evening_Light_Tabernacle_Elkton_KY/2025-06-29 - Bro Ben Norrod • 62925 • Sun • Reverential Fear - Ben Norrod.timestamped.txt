[23:58] to talk about
[24:01] We realize it's because they're lost and
[24:04] they're unlike

[24:13] here.
[24:23] We ask the preacher when he comes
[24:28] that you would
[24:30] like our
[24:32] brother Brad
[24:39] call like a long faces
[24:44] depressed anxiety
[24:47] with all kind of sist
[24:53] Lord Jesus
[24:58] ask you
[25:01] know the preacher don't go ain't going
[25:04] to hinder me if my daddy don't go it's
[25:07] not going to hinder me we allitude
[25:11] this morning
[25:14] it'll be us we ask you help us this day
[25:18] all the scripture reading

[25:27] Amen. Uh children can be dismissed to

[26:46] mountains and all hills, fruitful trees
[26:50] and all cedars.
[27:06] Let them praise the name of the Lord.
[27:08] For his name alone is excellent. His
[27:11] glory is above the heaven, the earth and
[27:13] heaven.
[27:15] He also exaltth the horn of his people.
[27:17] The praise of all his saints, even of
[27:20] the children of Israel, a people near
[27:22] unto him. Praise ye the Lord. Amen.
[27:27] God bless you. Um, brother Brian,
[27:40] you can all be seated.
[27:46] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[27:51] I was just going to, you don't have to
[27:52] turn here. I was going to read a
[27:54] scripture. You know, I was
[27:57] thinking this morning,
[28:00] well, not so much thinking, trying to
[28:03] come up with a thought on what to say
[28:06] this morning.
[28:10] And the the thing that really struck me
[28:13] this morning is I was just thinking the
[28:15] scriptures say and brother Brandham
[28:17] said, you know,
[28:20] as we come to the end, the very world
[28:23] out there, the spirit that's in the
[28:25] world is trying to bind you as an
[28:27] individual, it's trying to bind
[28:29] everybody to a creed or to a way that's
[28:32] not the true way of the word of God. And
[28:35] I was I was thinking this morning, I'll
[28:38] just read these three scriptures here
[28:40] and I just see where it goes. And this
[28:43] is uh Genesis 12. And it says, "Now the
[28:45] Lord had said unto Abram, his name
[28:48] hadn't been changed yet. Get thee out of
[28:50] the country from the kindred and from
[28:53] thy father's house and the land I will
[28:55] show thee." And he also pro, this is a
[28:57] promise that he gave Abraham. Uh, I will
[29:01] make thee a great nation, and I will
[29:03] bless thee, and make thy name great, and
[29:05] thou shalt be a blessing, and I will
[29:08] bless them that bless thee, and curse
[29:10] them that curse thee, and in thee shall
[29:12] all families of the earth be blessed.
[29:15] And I was just thinking the the world
[29:18] out there whether whether it's Muslim or
[29:21] whether it's Christian or Jew
[29:26] it it's just trying to bind people to a
[29:29] creed like I said earlier away that's
[29:32] not in the word of God this morning. But
[29:35] the what really strikes me is the amount
[29:37] of
[29:39] anti-semitism
[29:40] that you see out there in the world. You
[29:42] know, we we we just live in little old
[29:45] Kentucky, but if you go to Europe or you
[29:48] go to uh nations in Europe, the
[29:51] anti-semitism, the amount of anti-Jew
[29:54] hatred in the world is unbelievable.
[29:56] It's just increasing as it goes on. And
[29:59] it won't be too long here. And and
[30:02] people read that scripture this morning
[30:04] and it'll it'll make them angry. But the
[30:07] thing they forget that through Abraham,
[30:11] we have our blessing this morning too.
[30:13] The whole world was blessed in Abraham.
[30:15] But let me and these people will accuse
[30:20] you of being a Zionist. But when when
[30:24] you read something like that and people
[30:26] tell you, well,
[30:28] um, God doesn't deal with the children
[30:30] of Israel anymore. He's moved on to the
[30:33] church of Jesus Christ. Well, I was
[30:36] listening to all these debates and all
[30:38] this struggle people had. And what
[30:40] really struck me outside of the word of
[30:43] God this morning, anything that is that
[30:47] you receive outside of the word of God,
[30:50] to me, it's just propaganda. It's
[30:52] nothing but propaganda. If it ain't if
[30:54] it ain't in the word of God or the
[30:55] message of the hour, to me, I just shake
[30:58] my head. It's just nothing but
[31:00] propaganda out there. Whether it's on
[31:03] whatever
[31:05] whatever wherever you get your news or
[31:07] whatever anything out there, it's just
[31:09] all propaganda. It's all you don't know
[31:12] what to believe anymore because it's
[31:14] people have their own way or they want
[31:16] their own idea or want they're trying to
[31:18] influence you to go away that you
[31:20] should. And I was just thinking if you
[31:22] didn't have the word of God this
[31:24] morning, where would we be this morning?
[31:26] What kind of people would we be? You
[31:28] know, and the problem with the church
[31:32] The problem with the church, you know,
[31:34] there's church natural and church
[31:36] spiritual. You know what the problem
[31:38] with the church and with the believers?
[31:40] And I see this a lot when you're dealing
[31:41] with Muslims and Jews. Most Christians,
[31:45] you know, they have to walk away. You
[31:46] know why they have to walk away? Most
[31:48] Jews know their Torah, know what they
[31:51] believe. And most Muslims know the Quran
[31:54] and know what they believe. And then
[31:57] when you just Christians, they don't
[32:00] know what they believe. They don't spend
[32:01] any time in the word of God. They don't
[32:04] get grounded in the word of God. And
[32:06] most important, they don't have a
[32:08] relationship with Jesus Christ. It's
[32:10] just a song and a dance to them. It's
[32:12] just all it's all aesthetics. It's
[32:14] something they go every Sunday and they
[32:17] leave every Sunday and the person in the
[32:20] individual has been changed. So when
[32:22] they interact with people in the world,
[32:24] there's no foundation. So they can be
[32:27] easily quieted down and really made to
[32:29] know what they be embarrassed to know
[32:32] they don't really know what they
[32:33] believe.
[32:35] But I was just thinking anytime
[32:38] someone talks to you saying that well
[32:42] and actually in the church world that we
[32:44] live in, you know, they would consider
[32:45] me a heretic because actually there's a
[32:48] lot of mainline denominations out there
[32:51] that don't believe the children of
[32:53] Israel have a right to be a nation
[32:55] again. So they would consider you a
[32:57] heretic. But I don't know if you all
[33:00] would know this, but if someone was
[33:03] questioning what I just read in in the
[33:06] uh 13th and 12th chapter, if you read
[33:09] those next 10 chapters, Abraham's name
[33:11] wasn't changed for a few chapters later,
[33:14] but they forget that the whole um I'm
[33:17] I'm going to say this again. And the the
[33:19] whole world was blessed in Abraham. and
[33:22] really strikes me if
[33:24] and you see what's happened over the
[33:27] last couple of thousands of years,
[33:30] any of the nations that fought against
[33:32] Israel, are they here on the face of the
[33:34] earth anymore? No, they're not here.
[33:37] They're dust. Their memory is gone. Moab
[33:40] is gone. Ammon is gone. All those
[33:42] nations are gone. They're not no more
[33:46] anymore. anyone that decided to fight
[33:49] against it and it's no different there
[33:50] will be outside of you walking in Christ
[33:54] there'll be no membrance of anything or
[33:57] anyone but really struck me I I don't
[34:01] I'm not going to say that I know I say
[34:02] that a lot but you know it's really
[34:06] important for the believer this morning
[34:08] I know they've been for the last couple
[34:10] of months you know the theme has been if
[34:14] you know we all know what the message of
[34:17] the hour. Just like they were talking,
[34:19] you know, Brother Brham said, "Full
[34:21] obedience to the word of God." What does
[34:23] it entitle you to? It entitles you to
[34:26] the token. It entitles you to the
[34:28] literal life of Jesus Christ, the very
[34:31] presence of Christ in your heart and
[34:33] life this morning. But you have to be
[34:36] obedient to the whole word of God. And
[34:38] if you don't know the word of God, how
[34:40] do you know to be obedient to it? And
[34:42] I'm if I read this whole chapter, but
[34:46] anytime someone questions your theology,
[34:50] Brother Brandham taught a lot of
[34:51] messages about this too, but I I would
[34:54] always go there's several other chapters
[34:56] I would go to, but I would always go to
[34:58] the 11th chapter of Romans. When people
[35:01] tell you that and then anytime someone
[35:04] talks to you about the children of
[35:05] Israel not having representation in the
[35:08] end time, well then we know that you can
[35:10] go to Daniel the 70 weeks. You know that
[35:13] they're going to be have be a nation
[35:14] again. You can go to Revelations where
[35:17] God's going to deal with him sending two
[35:19] prophets. But you have to know the word
[35:21] of God to be able to apply it. And I was
[35:23] just going to read what Paul had to say
[35:25] here. And another thing I ask people and
[35:28] this is really striking
[35:33] just like we believe that brother Brown
[35:35] was the prophetic voice for this day and
[35:37] age. I always ask people do you believe
[35:39] that Paul was the prophetic voice for
[35:42] the first church. Do you believe he is
[35:44] the one that God intended to put set the
[35:47] church in order? And their their answer
[35:49] lets you know exactly fundamentally
[35:51] where they are in the scriptures. But
[35:53] I'll read what
[35:55] this is a long chapter. I'll cut it.
[35:58] I'll go start at the beginning. But the
[36:00] 11th chapter of Romans and it deals with
[36:03] this that you know the wild branch and
[36:06] the good branch. And it says here I say
[36:09] then hath God cast away his people? God
[36:12] forbid. Paul's already establishing this
[36:15] here. For I also am an Israelite of the
[36:17] seed of Abraham of the tribe of
[36:19] Benjamin. God hath not cast away his
[36:22] people which he forneew. What not? For
[36:24] the scripture saith of Elias, he hath
[36:27] maketh intercession to God against
[36:29] Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed
[36:31] thy prophets. Dig down thy altars. I am
[36:34] left alone to seek thy life. But we know
[36:36] what the answer. But he saith the answer
[36:40] onto him, I have reserved to myself
[36:43] 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to
[36:46] the image of Bal. And it's no different
[36:48] in our day and age. There's individuals
[36:50] here that are the same way that God has
[36:52] put his token on you this morning. Even
[36:54] so, then at the present time, there be a
[36:57] remement according to election grace.
[37:00] And I'm going to jump up to
[37:03] about the 12th the 12th verse, not
[37:06] reading all this, and then sit down.
[37:07] Now, if if it fall on them to be the
[37:10] riches of the world, and the dim I'm at
[37:12] the 12th verse, diminishing of them the
[37:14] riches of the gentile, how much more
[37:17] their fullness. For I speak to you
[37:19] Gentiles, this so much which I am
[37:21] apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my
[37:24] office. And if by any means I might
[37:27] provoke to emulation them which are of
[37:29] my flesh might save some. For if the
[37:32] casting away of them be the reconciling
[37:34] of the world, what shall the receiving
[37:36] of them be? But for the life from dead?
[37:40] For if the first fruit be holy, the lump
[37:43] is hol is also holy. And if the root be
[37:46] holy, so are the branches. So anything
[37:48] that's from that original tree that God,
[37:51] if he springs out another branch, it's
[37:53] going to be holy, too. Boast not against
[37:55] the branches, but if thou boast, thou
[37:58] beest not the root, but the root there.
[38:00] If thou will say, then the branches were
[38:02] broken off, and I might be grafted in.
[38:04] This is where I think uh brother
[38:07] Brandham talk a lot of this is where I
[38:08] think most Christian churches don't
[38:10] really see it is that it should humble
[38:14] us to know that God was willing to deal
[38:15] with us as Gentiles
[38:18] and that put us in this tree to make
[38:21] give us representation on that day and
[38:24] then uh
[38:25] they say then the branches were broken
[38:27] off that I might be grafted. Well,
[38:29] because of unbelief, they were broken
[38:32] off. And thou standest by faith. Be, and
[38:35] Paul says this, "Be not high minded, but
[38:38] fear. For if God spared not the natural
[38:41] branches, take heed, least he also spare
[38:44] not thee." And I I'm not going to read
[38:46] this whole chapter, but that's what
[38:48] really strikes me.
[38:52] It's getting to be a late hour. I mean,
[38:55] I know for the preachers come up, I've
[38:58] when you get the older you get, you've
[39:00] heard it a thousand times. It's getting
[39:02] late. The hour is late. But I can say in
[39:05] my own heart, it is a late hour. And
[39:08] the, you know, you hear people say the
[39:10] time for playing church is over. But
[39:12] we're well past that statement right
[39:14] now. I mean, as an individual, I can see
[39:17] right now the way the world is, the way
[39:18] the church is, that it's really
[39:20] important that every hour and every
[39:22] minute of your life, you're connected to
[39:24] that source this morning. That the
[39:26] presence of Jesus Christ and the word of
[39:28] God, there's no way that you'll be
[39:30] successful in the world this morning or
[39:33] in this life if you're not connected. If
[39:35] you get disconnected from that presence,
[39:38] it it's just not a place to be anymore.
[39:41] It the world is a
[39:44] I just think of how quick it's going.
[39:46] You know, Brother Brandham said it's
[39:47] going to get quicker and quicker and
[39:49] quicker. You know, you can't count, you
[39:51] know, well, it used to be a day or two
[39:54] maybe things would change. Now it's it
[39:56] could the whole world could be different
[39:58] 10 minutes from that's how quick the age
[40:00] that we live in is this morning. And
[40:02] without the grace of God this morning,
[40:05] who would we really be? And I I really
[40:07] think of that a lot. So anyway, and then
[40:10] when you say that this I'll just finish
[40:12] with a thought. Always remember that
[40:14] Peter in the in the second book of Peter
[40:18] in the third chapter, Peter points back
[40:21] to Paul and identify who Paul is in the
[40:25] scripture. So the teachings of Paul are
[40:27] just as important as any other
[40:29] scripture. So you'll have a lot of
[40:31] Christians that'll fuss with you about
[40:32] the teachings of Paul. Well, the
[40:34] teachings of Paul, the teach, it's all
[40:36] the word of God. And we're all
[40:38] accountable for every word that God
[40:40] speaks. Brother David,
[40:46] excuse me.
[40:59] Amen. It's good to be here. Is it okay
[41:02] if I give a little praise report before
[41:04] singing the first song? Um, so on
[41:07] Thursday we were working out at uh land
[41:11] between the lakes right now and uh
[41:14] Thursday it was a hot sunny day and in
[41:17] the afternoon a big rain cloud come
[41:19] dumped a lot of rain everywhere and
[41:20] we're hauling logs and uh Jonah just
[41:24] loaded me and I left the woods and about
[41:26] 30 minutes later I was on a two-lane
[41:28] highway and uh it just rained real hard
[41:31] for about 15 minutes and road was real
[41:33] slick and I was coming up to a
[41:36] intersection just with stop signs on the
[41:38] side. I I had the ride away and uh so
[41:41] I'm doing about 55 and I'm fully loaded
[41:43] and there's two cars waiting to pull out
[41:46] and uh across the intersection there's
[41:48] like a restaurant right there like right
[41:49] off the road and there's not a lot of
[41:51] space on either side and um as I was
[41:54] coming through the first car pulled out
[41:56] he had plenty of time and so I kind of
[41:58] just tapped on the brakes got down to
[42:00] about 50. Well, the car behind him
[42:02] decided he wanted to go too, so he
[42:04] hammered it and I guess it was a rear
[42:06] wheel drive car because he did a total
[42:08] 360 facing back the way he started.
[42:11] Well, he kept on it and did another 180
[42:13] and came back into my lane. I guess he
[42:15] panicked and he slammed the brakes. So,
[42:17] next thing I knew, my lane was just
[42:19] totally blocked and I was maybe
[42:22] 300 yards from him with a fully loaded
[42:25] truck doing 50 and it was really slick.
[42:27] So, I about stood up on the air bra and
[42:29] I felt my truck slide forward and I had
[42:32] a line that I could pick that was just
[42:34] kind of diagonal left of him because his
[42:36] bumper was still even in the other lane.
[42:38] So, I just picked that line and just
[42:41] held my steering wheel. I was like, I
[42:42] really don't want to roll this truck.
[42:44] And uh the my truck kept tracking and I
[42:47] was able to go around him. I I I didn't
[42:50] look at my mirrors, but I'd guess it was
[42:52] probably 6 in that I missed his car by
[42:54] and cuz he was taking up part of both
[42:56] lanes and uh but yeah, and then so I was
[42:59] able to regain traction, get back on the
[43:01] road and keep going on. But I just want
[43:03] to thank the Lord for watching over me,
[43:05] protecting me that day.
[43:10] Now, let's sing. Bless the Lord, oh my
[43:12] soul.

[56:49] them a real experience Lord Jesus that

[56:59] experience experience, Lord Jesus. We

[57:10] of your grace, Lord Jesus, to be saved

[57:26] morning in a special way. Lord Jesus,

[57:31] our bodies and to our souls, Lord Jesus.

[1:01:26] the Lord.
[1:01:28] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[1:01:33] lies.
[1:01:35] For whom the raging of the sea
[1:01:40] subsides.
[1:01:42] The living sacrifice.
[1:01:46] The only source of life. My hope
[1:01:53] is in the Lord.
[1:01:56] From this time on
[1:01:59] and ever more,
[1:02:03] all of my hope
[1:02:06] is in the Lord
[1:02:10] forever more.

[1:02:19] with every rising sun
[1:02:23] to meet the sinner and his brokenness

[1:04:16] and I should have fallen
[1:04:21] my soul
[1:04:24] cast down
[1:04:26] but mercy
[1:04:29] it rero
[1:04:32] my life. Let's just close our eyes and
[1:04:34] sing it one more time.
[1:04:35] Oh God's mercy,
[1:04:39] it rro
[1:04:41] my life.
[1:04:45] Oh God's mercy,
[1:04:49] it reroll
[1:04:51] my life.
[1:04:56] Oh, and I should have fallen.
[1:05:01] My soul
[1:05:04] cast down.
[1:05:06] But bless you, buddy. Appreciate it.
[1:05:08] Good to see you. Radro
[1:05:11] my love
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:20] our life. Where will we be?
[1:05:23] One thing that I'm confident of is that
[1:05:26] my story was already wrote.
[1:05:30] My great greatgrandfathers,
[1:05:32] grandmothers, aunts, uncles, and my
[1:05:34] forefathers had already set the course
[1:05:36] of my life.
[1:05:39] Drunks, liars, thieves, mongers,
[1:05:42] you name it, that was all poured into my
[1:05:45] genetics when I took the breath of life.
[1:05:48] And had I went the same course as every
[1:05:50] other Norod ever went, I'd have been a
[1:05:53] bum, cheated on my wife, beat my kids.
[1:05:56] Ain't no telling where I wound up. But
[1:05:59] one day, Jesus stepped out of the
[1:06:00] bushes.
[1:06:02] I said, "Come here. I want to talk to
[1:06:03] you a minute about something. You're not
[1:06:06] a NORD.
[1:06:07] You're my son."
[1:06:10] And mercy
[1:06:12] rewrote my life. From that point on, my
[1:06:15] story has constantly been rewrote.
[1:06:19] every day, every mistake, every victory,
[1:06:22] every up, every down, he just constantly
[1:06:26] rewrites the story again and again. You
[1:06:30] know, one of the great blessings I had
[1:06:33] reading the message one time was when as
[1:06:36] a brother opened up about Abraham,
[1:06:39] he lied two different times before and
[1:06:42] after his name changed. He lied. Then
[1:06:44] brother Brandham said, "But when Paul
[1:06:46] wrote his divine commentary, he never
[1:06:49] mentioned anything about his lying.
[1:06:52] Never mentioned anything about him
[1:06:53] getting scared and laughing in the face
[1:06:56] of God." None of that was ever
[1:06:58] mentioned. That's what mercy does for
[1:07:00] us, friends. Hallelujah.
[1:07:03] Glory to God. It rewrites all of that.
[1:07:08] All of those little blunders, all those
[1:07:10] mistakes of life. We don't have to worry
[1:07:12] about none of that. None of that will
[1:07:14] meet us at the day of judgment.
[1:07:17] If it does go down on the book, there's
[1:07:20] this thing called the blood of Christ,
[1:07:21] the bleach. It just puts it right out of
[1:07:24] the book. And you don't you don't ever
[1:07:26] have to worry about those things meeting
[1:07:28] you at that day. Because any true
[1:07:30] Christian, they want to be right with
[1:07:31] God. The minute they do something wrong,
[1:07:33] they can tell, they can feel it, they
[1:07:35] know it, and they immediately, they want
[1:07:36] to repent, get their heart right with
[1:07:38] God. What can I do, Lord? What can I be?
[1:07:40] How how can I make this thing right? And
[1:07:42] the blood of Christ, if we walk in the
[1:07:44] light as he is in the light, the blood
[1:07:46] of Jesus Christ cleanses us from how
[1:07:49] much? All unrighteousness.
[1:07:53] Praise be to God. We sure love the Lord
[1:07:56] today. You can be seated if you'd like.
[1:07:58] Invite my wife to come. And want to just
[1:08:01] say quickly how much we appreciate
[1:08:04] Brother Ber allowing us to come by. It's
[1:08:07] always um it's always nice to get to
[1:08:09] come back home. This is home for me as
[1:08:11] much as home's ever been. And um I've
[1:08:14] been coming to you folks about 20 years
[1:08:16] now, so it better be home, huh? Amen.
[1:08:19] So, we we sure appreciate you folks and
[1:08:21] love you. And uh trust that you'll get a
[1:08:24] great blessing in today's service. And
[1:08:26] if you don't, it's your fault
[1:08:29] cuz I come loaded up and ready to
[1:08:31] preach. So if you're if you're not ready
[1:08:34] to eat, you come out of here hungry,
[1:08:35] it's going to be your own fault. Praise
[1:08:38] the Lord. Amen. So we sure appreciate
[1:08:41] God. And um appreciate the way the Lord
[1:08:44] has been moving for us as Christians.
[1:08:46] You can see the hand of the Lord
[1:08:47] everywhere we turn. And I want to say
[1:08:50] how grateful I am to hear that
[1:08:51] testimony, Sister Don. I'm so so proud
[1:08:54] for the Lord doing what he done for you.
[1:08:56] It makes me proud to be a Christian when
[1:08:58] I hear things like that. just makes my
[1:09:01] heart swell with pride to know he is you
[1:09:03] are a living testimony in 2025 that he
[1:09:07] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:09:08] forever.
[1:09:11] Thank God.
[1:09:13] I am so grateful to the Lord.
[1:09:18] And if he could do that for her, what
[1:09:20] could he do for each one of us sitting
[1:09:22] here today? He's able to do exceedingly
[1:09:25] abundantly. Is that right? above all we
[1:09:28] can ask or think. He's able to do all of
[1:09:30] it. And so we we so thank for the Lord.
[1:09:33] And again, uh we so appreciate Brother
[1:09:35] Tom and of course my friend Brother
[1:09:36] Brad. I can't ignore you back there. Not
[1:09:38] by no means he family, too. I claimed
[1:09:41] you anyways. Whether you do me or not,
[1:09:43] we've done claimed him. And so we uh we
[1:09:45] appreciate everybody. Appreciate the
[1:09:47] Lord. And sure good to be back in the
[1:09:48] house of God. Y'all happy to see the
[1:09:50] little giant here?
[1:09:53] That's the little girl with the big
[1:09:54] voice right there. And uh we sure
[1:09:57] appreciate Sam. She's uh she don't
[1:09:58] always get to come with me. You know,
[1:10:00] school and things kind of keeps her
[1:10:01] bound up sometimes, but I'm always
[1:10:03] grateful when she does. Can you believe
[1:10:04] this pretty supermodel standing over
[1:10:07] here has put up with me 27 years as of
[1:10:10] two days ago?
[1:10:13] M.
[1:10:17] Praise the Lord. Or yesterday was our
[1:10:20] anniversary, wasn't it? Today's 29th.
[1:10:22] Hey, day before. Let's see. Today's 29th
[1:10:25] 27th, wasn't it? So, two days ago. Yep.
[1:10:27] Two days ago.
[1:10:29] That's what happens the closer you get
[1:10:30] to 50. I know. That's right. But, uh, we
[1:10:33] sure appreciate my wife. I just want to
[1:10:35] say how much I love her and I appreciate
[1:10:37] her and, uh, she's a good girl and I
[1:10:40] appreciate that she's gave her talents
[1:10:41] to the Lord. She means what she sings.
[1:10:45] And, uh, I I'm always having to get on
[1:10:47] her a little bit though sometimes
[1:10:48] because she won't show off enough for
[1:10:49] me. The girl can really sing, but she
[1:10:51] holds back. And I said, 'You know, I
[1:10:53] want you to let it rip. I always tell it
[1:10:55] that all the time, just let it rip. Let
[1:10:56] it rip. And uh to me, if you're going to
[1:10:59] do anything for the Lord, of course, you
[1:11:00] all know how I am. Do it with everything
[1:11:02] you got. Don't don't hold back. Not one
[1:11:04] iota. If you're going to do it. And uh
[1:11:07] we we appreciate the Lord for her gift
[1:11:09] and for her her love for me. I want to
[1:11:12] say publicly and happy anniversary to my
[1:11:15] beloved wife. And so we love you very
[1:11:17] very much. And we appreciate her sharing
[1:11:19] her talents with this little church.
[1:11:20] She's been coming here a long time, too.
[1:11:22] So, we want to say thank the Lord for
[1:11:23] her. And so, we appreciate you folks.
[1:11:25] God bless you. We're going to sing get
[1:11:27] right into the preaching of the word of
[1:11:28] the Lord. Can you give us the key? Sure.
[1:11:31] Absolutely.

[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:54] Even though my spirit's low and it seems
[1:12:01] I can hardly go, but still
[1:12:06] I see victory.
[1:12:12] Many times
[1:12:14] I'm walking by faith.
[1:12:18] Can't see what lies before me, but still
[1:12:26] I see victory.
[1:12:32] I just got to tell you, Satan can't
[1:12:36] cross the bloodline
[1:12:39] because I'm covered by his blood.
[1:12:44] And you may stare and you may fight.
[1:12:48] You're going to lose this battle
[1:12:50] tonight. Remember,
[1:12:54] you can't cross the bloodline.
[1:12:59] Sometimes our battles get hot. It seems
[1:13:03] we're fighting a lot. Oh, I remember.
[1:13:08] I'm standing on the rock.
[1:13:13] So, Satan, if I were you, I'd turn
[1:13:18] around and give up, too. Cuz I do
[1:13:21] believe
[1:13:23] you're bound to lose.
[1:13:27] I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't
[1:13:32] cross the bloodline
[1:13:35] because I'm covered by his
[1:13:39] blood.

[1:14:14] you're going to lose this battle
[1:14:16] tonight. Cuz remember,
[1:14:20] you can't cross the bloodline. Amen. You
[1:14:24] must remember
[1:14:27] you can't cross the bloodline. Sing that
[1:14:30] second verse again.
[1:14:33] Sometimes our battles get hot and it
[1:14:37] seems we're fighting a lot. Oh, I
[1:14:40] remember
[1:14:42] I'm standing on the rock.
[1:14:47] So, Satan, if I were you, I'd turn
[1:14:51] around and give up to cuz I do believe
[1:14:57] you're bound to
[1:15:02] I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't
[1:15:06] cross the bloodline
[1:15:10] because I'm covered by his
[1:15:14] blood.
[1:15:16] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[1:15:20] you're going to lose this battle
[1:15:22] tonight. Cuz remember,
[1:15:25] I can't cross the bloodline. Sing it
[1:15:29] again. Oh, I just got to tell you,
[1:15:33] Satan, you can't cross the bloodline
[1:15:39] because I'm covered by his
[1:15:43] blood. And you may stare and you may
[1:15:47] fight. You're going to lose this battle
[1:15:51] tonight. Remember,
[1:15:54] you can't cross the bloodline.
[1:15:58] You must remember.
[1:16:02] You can't cross the bloodline.
[1:16:08] You must remember.
[1:16:12] You can cross the bloodline.
[1:16:17] You may stare and you may fight, but
[1:16:20] you're going to lose this battle
[1:16:22] tonight. Remember,
[1:16:27] we can't cross the blood.
[1:16:34] Hallelujah.
[1:16:37] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:41] And thank you, Lord God.
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:49] And when I look,
[1:16:51] what do I see?
[1:16:54] Nothing but a bunch of misery.
[1:16:57] I'm as happy as I can be with Jesus in
[1:17:02] my heart. And way down, way down in this
[1:17:07] heart of mine. And weigh down way down.
[1:17:10] There's peace of mind.
[1:17:14] There's lots of joy above in my soul.
[1:17:19] Same girl. And when the devil
[1:17:22] comes around
[1:17:25] to turn my smile upside down, I just
[1:17:29] raise my hand and say, "I'm happy in the
[1:17:33] Lord anyway."
[1:17:36] And went down way down in this heart of
[1:17:39] mine. Way down, way down. And there's a
[1:17:42] piece of way down.
[1:17:46] There's some joy above in my soul.
[1:17:52] And you may wonder why I sing and shout.
[1:17:56] Why get happy and I dance all about? I
[1:18:00] got a joy I cannot contain. with Jesus

[1:18:32] we've got a joy
[1:18:34] I cannot contain cuz Jesus is in our
[1:18:38] heart and way down

[1:19:02] down. There's a piece of way down.
[1:19:06] There's a flux of joy above the land in
[1:19:10] my soul.
[1:19:13] Above the land in my soul.
[1:19:18] In my soul.
[1:19:21] My soul.

[1:20:37] of your life

[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:45] Day stars shine town on.
[1:20:50] And let your love shine through me in
[1:20:54] the night.
[1:21:01] Oh, and lead me, Lord, and I'll follow
[1:21:06] anywhere you open up the door.
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:18] Let your word speak to me.
[1:21:21] Show me what I've never seen
[1:21:26] before.
[1:21:32] Lord, I want to be your witness.
[1:21:36] And you can take what's wrong and make
[1:21:40] it right.
[1:21:44] Make it right.
[1:21:48] Day stars shine down on me.
[1:21:52] Let your love shine through me in the
[1:21:56] night.
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:02] Lord, I see a world it's dying,
[1:22:07] wounded by the master of
[1:22:11] deceit.
[1:22:15] Groping in the darkness,
[1:22:18] they're haunted by the years of past
[1:22:22] defeat.
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:29] But then I see you standing near me,
[1:22:32] Lord. You're shining with compassion in
[1:22:37] your eyes.
[1:22:40] In your eyes,
[1:22:43] I pray Jesus shine down on me. Yes, sir.
[1:22:48] Oh, let your love shine through me in
[1:22:53] the night.

[1:23:19] what I've never seen
[1:23:23] before.
[1:23:27] [Music]
[1:23:29] Lord, I want to be witness.
[1:23:33] And you can take what's wrong and make
[1:23:36] it right.
[1:23:40] Make it right.
[1:23:44] Take your stars shine down on me

[1:23:52] the night.
[1:23:57] Oh, I pray Jesus shine down on me
[1:24:03] and let your love shine through me in
[1:24:07] the night.
[1:24:13] In the
[1:24:16] night.
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:27] Hallelujah.
[1:24:28] [Applause]
[1:24:30] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:33] Amen. Good singing. Let's stand
[1:24:35] together. We'll get right into the
[1:24:37] preaching of the word of the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:39] Sorry, brother.
[1:24:41] If you got your Bible this morning, the
[1:24:43] book of Ecclesiastes,
[1:24:45] let's go to chapter 12.
[1:24:49] Thank you, Lord. Let me be a light, God.
[1:24:53] Can you say amen to that? Amen. Let me
[1:24:56] be a light. Thank you, musicians. That
[1:24:58] was fun.
[1:25:00] I enjoyed that. People People get on me
[1:25:02] all the time. You talk about having fun
[1:25:04] in church. I said, "Yeah, where should I
[1:25:06] have it?
[1:25:08] Better place to have it in church."
[1:25:09] Ain't that right? Better spot.
[1:25:12] Ecclesiastes 12. I want to speak to you
[1:25:14] this morning on reverential fear.
[1:25:17] Reverential fear or reverent fear.
[1:25:21] And if you need help spelling it back
[1:25:23] here in the tapes, we we may have to
[1:25:25] Google it. It's a little bit of a big
[1:25:27] word, huh?
[1:25:28] Reverential fear. I had to look it up,
[1:25:30] so don't feel bad.
[1:25:33] Ecclesiastes 12, I want to look at
[1:25:35] verses uh 13-4.
[1:25:40] He said, "Let us hear the conclusion of
[1:25:42] the whole matter." Help me say these two
[1:25:46] words. Fear God and keep his
[1:25:49] commandments. For this is the whole duty
[1:25:53] of man. For God shall bring every work
[1:25:56] into judgment with every secret thing
[1:25:59] whether it be good or whether it be
[1:26:03] evil.
[1:26:04] Now I have but with me today this is the
[1:26:07] Lamza Bible. Remember brother Bram
[1:26:09] talking about the Lamza Bible. I want to
[1:26:11] read to you just that 13th verse and the
[1:26:15] way that it reads here in the Lamza
[1:26:16] Bible. Let us hear the conclusion of the
[1:26:19] whole matter. Fear the Lord and keep his
[1:26:22] commandments. This is given by one
[1:26:26] master to every man. By one master to
[1:26:29] every man. This is the whole duty, the
[1:26:32] whole commandment of God given by one
[1:26:36] master. So we don't need 78 overlords.
[1:26:41] pastors, evangelists, teachers,
[1:26:42] apostles, prophets. We're we're
[1:26:44] ministers, but we're not masters.
[1:26:47] There's one master, even God. He's the
[1:26:50] one that we answer to. He's the one that
[1:26:52] we listen to. He's the one we obey. Come
[1:26:54] on now.
[1:26:57] We may obey preachers and things, but
[1:26:59] we're only obeying them as in the word,
[1:27:01] as in the Lord. If a man gets off from
[1:27:03] the word, then there's no obedience
[1:27:04] needed there, right? We stick with the
[1:27:07] word of God. If a man is preaching the
[1:27:09] word, then that's where we take our cues
[1:27:11] from. We have one master in this
[1:27:14] message, and that is the Lord Jesus
[1:27:15] Christ. Amen. Let's pray over the word,
[1:27:17] can we? Father, thank you so much for
[1:27:19] the opportunity to come into your house
[1:27:21] today. It's such a blessing, Lord, to be
[1:27:23] here again. So many friends and faces of
[1:27:26] uh such feeling in my heart toward him.
[1:27:29] Lord, I just love this little body of
[1:27:31] people. I pray that you'll bless this
[1:27:33] meeting today. God, I trust that you'll
[1:27:37] not only come on your word and just
[1:27:40] anoint it, Lord, and bring it into a
[1:27:42] great just uh uh crescendo of your
[1:27:46] spirit, but Lord, that you'll minister
[1:27:49] it individually to all of our hearts as
[1:27:52] you just break forth upon this word,
[1:27:55] Lord. And as you lay your spirit right
[1:27:57] down into it, may these words just jump
[1:28:00] out of the pages, Lord, and become life
[1:28:01] to us. And father, may you anoint me and
[1:28:04] strengthen me today to be able to
[1:28:05] deliver it. Open their hearts that they
[1:28:07] can receive it. May we be blessed and
[1:28:10] benefited by our gathering as we ask for
[1:28:12] your great divine blessing upon today's
[1:28:14] service as we commit it to you, Lord,
[1:28:16] for the glory of God. And in the name of
[1:28:18] Jesus Christ and all the saints said,
[1:28:21] "Amen and amen." You may be seated. May
[1:28:23] the Lord bless you. I um I'm so grateful
[1:28:28] to to know the Lord Jesus as my savior.
[1:28:31] Aren't you? Amen. Not only as my savior
[1:28:34] but as my lord. He is our our soon
[1:28:38] cominging king but let us not forget he
[1:28:42] is also our master and he is also the
[1:28:45] one that we have voluntarily given our
[1:28:48] hearts to in service to him. Not just as
[1:28:53] a uh group of people that's been
[1:28:56] dictated over or forced to do something
[1:28:58] or made to do something but we have
[1:29:01] willingly and with free moral agency we
[1:29:04] have chosen to give our hearts to him to
[1:29:07] whatever he desires whatever he wants
[1:29:09] that's what we want and I think the best
[1:29:12] attitude a Christian could ever take in
[1:29:14] this life is Lord not th my my will
[1:29:17] rather but thine be done in heaven and
[1:29:20] in earth. Knowing this about Jesus and
[1:29:23] how he is, what kind of man he is,
[1:29:26] knowing that he's a God of such love and
[1:29:28] grace and healing and deliverance and
[1:29:31] things like that, we we must also
[1:29:33] realize that he's a God that demands
[1:29:36] respects out of his people. And he wants
[1:29:39] us to fear him, but not necessarily be
[1:29:43] afraid of him, but he wants us to fear
[1:29:45] him or have respect for him. And let me
[1:29:48] read to you something out of the message
[1:29:50] respects to give you a better picture of
[1:29:51] what I mean. Brother Bham said in this
[1:29:53] he's reading from the uh from the book
[1:29:55] of Ecclesiastes. And he says the
[1:29:57] conclusion of the whole matter is to
[1:30:00] fear God. And when you cannot have
[1:30:03] respects until you have fear.
[1:30:07] Pardon me. You've got to have fear of
[1:30:09] God. Solomon said in the Proverbs also
[1:30:12] that the fear of God is the beginning of
[1:30:15] wisdom. And the fear of God being the
[1:30:18] beginning of wisdom. He said, "Now, that
[1:30:19] don't mean that you're afraid of him.
[1:30:22] But when you respect God, you fear God.
[1:30:25] You fear that you might displease him in
[1:30:28] some way. You fear that you would do
[1:30:30] something wrong." He said, "You wouldn't
[1:30:32] want to do that." So, our fear of God,
[1:30:35] our reverential fear that we have for
[1:30:37] God is a fear of respects. It's a a
[1:30:40] matter of respect toward God. I go to
[1:30:43] churches around the message of the hour
[1:30:44] and and and as I've traveled for many,
[1:30:47] many years now. I I I've seen everything
[1:30:50] north, south, east, west. I could write
[1:30:52] volumes of books on the things I've seen
[1:30:54] done in church, right and wrong for that
[1:30:56] matter. And I I lose count of the times
[1:30:59] that when I go into the house of God, I
[1:31:02] can always tell where the Holy Spirit's
[1:31:04] going to show up the greatest is in a
[1:31:05] group of people that have the greatest
[1:31:07] respect for God. For those that you know
[1:31:10] when you're talking and having
[1:31:11] fellowship and things like that, they're
[1:31:13] always cutting down some old joke on
[1:31:15] somebody else or always cutting up and
[1:31:17] carrying on a bunch of nonsense all the
[1:31:19] time. Well, when you come into the
[1:31:20] church, you can pretty well tell that's
[1:31:22] about the way it's going to be when you
[1:31:23] come into service. A lot of lackluster
[1:31:26] and not really a lot of respect and
[1:31:28] people talking and passing notes and
[1:31:29] chewing gum. I've never seen so many
[1:31:31] chewing gum chewers in my life as I have
[1:31:34] in the last five years. It's like people
[1:31:36] have got to the place to where coming
[1:31:38] into the house of God for them has
[1:31:39] become a casual thing, just an easygoing
[1:31:42] thing. And we don't really get the depth
[1:31:45] of the respect that we need to have for
[1:31:47] God. I I'm sure you understand what I'm
[1:31:49] talking about. Amen. And if we're not
[1:31:51] careful, this last day spirit is going
[1:31:54] to put us in a condition of being a lot
[1:31:57] more laid-back than what we should be
[1:31:59] knowing the kind of message that's been
[1:32:01] given to us and the kind of hour that
[1:32:03] we're living in. If there ever was a
[1:32:06] group of people that should have the
[1:32:08] highest regard and the highest respect
[1:32:10] for truth, it should be you and I. We
[1:32:13] should be the ones to be able to say, "I
[1:32:15] am going to show my respects to God over
[1:32:17] everybody else in the world." Amen.
[1:32:20] That's exactly right. Amen. I I I I find
[1:32:23] it amazing that churches have gotten so
[1:32:25] bold to where you know, and I'm not
[1:32:27] talking about message churches now, at
[1:32:28] least I don't think so anyways, but you
[1:32:30] got a group of people that's got a
[1:32:32] Starbucks across the hallway there.
[1:32:34] Amen. And they come on in and they bring
[1:32:35] their coffees. And I have seen this in
[1:32:37] message meetings where some old fell
[1:32:39] come up, they're going to talk a little
[1:32:40] while, set his cup of coffee down there
[1:32:42] by the pool pit and sip around for a
[1:32:44] little while and Amen. and they'll cut a
[1:32:46] few little old jokes and people looking
[1:32:48] around and falling asleep. Brother, if
[1:32:50] we've ever come to a place to where we
[1:32:53] need to learn to reverence and fear God,
[1:32:55] it's right now in this hour we're living
[1:32:57] in. Amen. We never ever need to lose
[1:33:00] that in any condition, shape, form, or
[1:33:02] fashion. Amen. If we lose our respect
[1:33:05] for God, that is the main element that
[1:33:08] it takes in order for us to receive his
[1:33:11] presence, to receive his word, to
[1:33:13] receive revelation, to be blessed, to be
[1:33:15] healed, to be educated in his truth, and
[1:33:18] to learn of him. Amen. And to know his
[1:33:20] right way. Amen. It takes godly fear and
[1:33:24] reverence and respect to get the people
[1:33:26] in that condition right there. Amen.
[1:33:28] This is the reason why. And I'm just
[1:33:30] going to go ahead and give you a little
[1:33:31] forewarning. And I haven't looked around
[1:33:33] the building too closely. I'm just
[1:33:35] seeing a few little head nods and some
[1:33:37] eye and some eyes around here and some
[1:33:39] faces. But I'm going to talk about
[1:33:41] holiness for a little while. And and and
[1:33:43] I don't want you to get scared now. I
[1:33:45] didn't bring my ruler to make sure all
[1:33:47] the sisters dresses are right in a
[1:33:48] certain length. Amen. And I don't have
[1:33:51] uh you know any kind of Facebook uh
[1:33:54] blackmail on me of any kind, nothing
[1:33:56] like that. But I'm just going to talk
[1:33:57] about the reason why that we do
[1:34:00] reverence God in the way of holiness.
[1:34:02] And you'll see why it is important for
[1:34:04] us as Christians to not only walk right
[1:34:07] and to believe right, but to dress
[1:34:09] right, to think right, and to have a
[1:34:11] pure heart before God. Because listen to
[1:34:14] me, the hour that we're living in,
[1:34:16] people are getting lazier and lazier and
[1:34:19] lazier when it comes to the things of
[1:34:21] God. And it does not matter how much you
[1:34:24] tell them, "Don't do it. Don't do it.
[1:34:26] Don't do it." You would think that the
[1:34:28] fear of a judging God would be enough
[1:34:31] for some people in this world, amen, to
[1:34:33] clean their act up and get straight. But
[1:34:36] don't forget, the anointing has so
[1:34:38] pulled off of this age until before this
[1:34:40] is over with, it'll be a hard thing for
[1:34:44] many of us to live in that anointing all
[1:34:47] the time.
[1:34:48] Some of you older ones in here has been
[1:34:50] serving God for a long time. You
[1:34:52] remember how it was 30 years ago. I
[1:34:55] remember even when I was a boy
[1:34:56] Christian, Amen. I could be standing on
[1:34:58] this platform, not a person in the
[1:35:00] building and a revival anointing come on
[1:35:03] me and shout and praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:35:04] I wasn't even doing nothing. It just
[1:35:06] showed up. Yeah. But now it looks like
[1:35:09] you need 10 weeks of revival with the
[1:35:11] greatest preachers in the message just
[1:35:12] to get a good amen out of some people.
[1:35:16] Praise the Lord. Now you understand that
[1:35:19] when we come to the end of this thing,
[1:35:21] it's going to be based upon how deep our
[1:35:25] character goes much more than how we
[1:35:28] feel something.
[1:35:30] I love to feel the Lord and I love to
[1:35:32] see people feel the Lord. I do
[1:35:34] everything I could. If I thought it
[1:35:36] would help, I climb up on that balcony
[1:35:37] and I'd jump off. Amen. And flap like a
[1:35:40] like a like a bird. If I thought it
[1:35:41] would help you, Amen. better. Amen. And
[1:35:44] in the old fashioned tent days, some of
[1:35:46] them old revival brothers would tell me
[1:35:47] they climb up the tent post and preach
[1:35:49] just to try to get the people into a
[1:35:51] better frame of mind. I do anything I
[1:35:53] thought would help you. Amen. Move into
[1:35:55] the spirit better.
[1:35:58] But we've moved into a cycle, into a
[1:36:00] season where we cannot rely upon
[1:36:02] feelings alone.
[1:36:04] That's right. Our revival cannot be
[1:36:06] based upon whether we feel high, whether
[1:36:09] we feel anointed, whether we feel saved,
[1:36:13] whether we feel born again. You're going
[1:36:15] to have to come to the place whether I
[1:36:17] feel it or whether I don't, I'm born
[1:36:20] again anyways.
[1:36:22] Hallelujah.
[1:36:25] That is the reason why Satan had made it
[1:36:28] his objective and his goal to get into
[1:36:30] the church living God and to make it
[1:36:33] formal.
[1:36:35] You know what formality is, don't you?
[1:36:37] Formality is not always somebody that's
[1:36:39] quiet in church. That's the idea we get
[1:36:41] in our mind. But formality is when
[1:36:43] people break into a routine but have no
[1:36:46] real passion behind it.
[1:36:50] Hang on everybody. But Pentecostal
[1:36:53] shouters and speakers and tongues can be
[1:36:56] just as formal as the ones sitting there
[1:36:58] not even squeaking like a like a mouse
[1:37:01] cuz you can get into all of the
[1:37:02] celebratory ways of serving God and all
[1:37:05] the ways of praising the Lord.
[1:37:07] Hallelujah. And and every every single
[1:37:09] bit of it be all right. Nothing wrong
[1:37:11] with a bit of it. And yet not coming
[1:37:13] from a passionate heart that is on fire
[1:37:15] from the Lord, but just doing what you
[1:37:18] do because it's more of a duty or a
[1:37:20] service. rather it is because you're in
[1:37:23] love with Jesus.
[1:37:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:31] And I I mentioned this last time about
[1:37:33] the clapping thing. I think I I downed
[1:37:36] some of your spirits on accident last
[1:37:37] time, but that's the reason why I was
[1:37:39] hitting on that a little bit. Not that I
[1:37:41] don't think it's right for you to clap,
[1:37:43] but people get so formal almost like
[1:37:45] they're sitting there watching an opera.
[1:37:49] Now you're clapping for Jesus. Thank you
[1:37:51] for that. You're clapping for the word.
[1:37:53] I appreciate that. But we've gotten to
[1:37:56] the place around the message to where we
[1:37:58] have a certain routine of worship.
[1:38:03] You know, I've been looking for a long
[1:38:04] time for the rule book on what worship
[1:38:06] looks like.
[1:38:08] The parameters of what a good
[1:38:11] Pentecostal worshipper looks like. I'm
[1:38:13] wondering, is your hands this high, this
[1:38:16] high, or this high?
[1:38:22] Do you shout on your left foot or your
[1:38:23] right foot? Do you kick it sideways or
[1:38:26] you go in a twirl? Which way is the most
[1:38:29] proper way of worship?
[1:38:34] The right way to worship God is when
[1:38:36] you're not thinking about it at all.
[1:38:40] Nothing's monitored, nothing's governed,
[1:38:43] nothing's measured. You just let go and
[1:38:45] let the Lord have his way. Woo! Amen.
[1:38:49] That's the best way to get down the line
[1:38:51] is just let the Holy Ghost have control.
[1:38:56] But we get so structured, you see. So
[1:38:58] when we want people to worship, we want
[1:39:00] them to worship loudly or something's
[1:39:02] wrong with them. Well, I got news for
[1:39:05] you. The loud ones ain't always the
[1:39:06] spiritual ones.
[1:39:09] Now, you loud ones going to have to hang
[1:39:11] on with me, too. Okay.
[1:39:14] The ameners aren't always the ones
[1:39:16] that's got the right kind of worship.
[1:39:18] I've been preaching in churches before
[1:39:20] and people around there cutting up.
[1:39:21] Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. And the
[1:39:23] Holy Spirit will pull me to somebody not
[1:39:25] sitting there saying a word.
[1:39:28] They got a better pull than the loud
[1:39:29] amener sometimes. But of course, the
[1:39:32] ones that are quiet are sitting there
[1:39:33] inside themselves. Not out loud, of
[1:39:34] course, but they're saying amen. Amen.
[1:39:36] That's right. Cuz you like that inside
[1:39:39] quiet amen, don't you? But it wouldn't
[1:39:41] hurt you to let it out every now and
[1:39:42] then.
[1:39:44] It wouldn't hurt you to holler, "Glory
[1:39:45] to God. That was good."
[1:39:50] But don't let it be because it's
[1:39:51] expected of you. Let it be done because
[1:39:53] you're loving Jesus. That you're giving
[1:39:56] your
[1:39:58] that you're giving your worship and your
[1:39:59] passion over to the Lord.
[1:40:04] Cuz it's easy to fall into routines.
[1:40:06] It's easy to fall into that whole thing
[1:40:08] of, "Oh, now I'm supposed to say amen
[1:40:10] here." So, uh, amen.
[1:40:14] But what if you didn't know what was
[1:40:15] what was what if you just accidentally
[1:40:17] started fixing your tractor and didn't
[1:40:19] hear what he said?
[1:40:22] What if your mind went to Walmart?
[1:40:26] Hello.
[1:40:29] You got to stay focused on what you're
[1:40:31] hearing and amen what you're hearing,
[1:40:34] not what you assume you're hearing.
[1:40:37] Because there are preachers in this
[1:40:38] message that are good at that. They've
[1:40:40] got all these great oneliners and
[1:40:42] they'll say all these great oneline
[1:40:44] statements and boy, they'll whip the
[1:40:45] crowd into a frenzy. People like, "Glory
[1:40:48] to God. Hallelujah." But if you deduce
[1:40:50] what's really being said, not really
[1:40:52] anything that you think is being said is
[1:40:54] actually being said. I'd rather a man
[1:40:57] preach to me and I understood where I
[1:40:59] stood when I got out of there.
[1:41:03] Than just to be hyped up.
[1:41:07] Now folks, you think this ain't
[1:41:08] something needed? I'll remind you what
[1:41:10] brother said in the church age book. He
[1:41:12] said that the impersonators of the last
[1:41:14] day will be Pentecostal.
[1:41:20] So close that they could deceive the
[1:41:23] elected if it was even possible.
[1:41:25] Thank God it's not possible, Brother
[1:41:27] David.
[1:41:29] Hallelujah. Thank God it's not possible
[1:41:31] for the elected to be deceived
[1:41:36] cuz you can see right through a lot of
[1:41:37] those things. A person can shout and
[1:41:41] have no reverence for God whatsoever.
[1:41:44] A person can speak in tongues,
[1:41:46] interpret, prophesy, and have no fear
[1:41:50] for God whatsoever. Come on, don't get
[1:41:52] quiet on me now. That's true. Just
[1:41:55] because they feel the emotional touch of
[1:41:57] the Holy Spirit doesn't mean they've got
[1:41:59] the reverential fear they need to serve
[1:42:01] God in the right way.
[1:42:03] How many of those you brother I'm
[1:42:05] talking about said they could speak in
[1:42:06] tongues like pouring peas on a dry cow
[1:42:08] hide
[1:42:10] and said they'd be out with some
[1:42:11] neighbor's wife or they'd pull some
[1:42:13] shady business deal or lie through their
[1:42:15] teeth and live a life that the devil
[1:42:17] would be embarrassed of.
[1:42:22] A real Christian learns how to respect
[1:42:26] God in every aspect of their life.
[1:42:30] And you see the other side of that coin
[1:42:32] is we hear a lot of this condemnation
[1:42:34] type stuff which is opposite of fear,
[1:42:36] real godly fear to say now don't shout
[1:42:39] any higher than you live.
[1:42:41] You know when they quote that quote they
[1:42:43] leave out all that other stuff about
[1:42:44] being forgiven, fighting things,
[1:42:46] battling things. Amen.
[1:42:50] Really, statements like that made in
[1:42:52] those kind of ways are intended on
[1:42:54] controlling the people, keeping them
[1:42:56] from getting too excited. Because you
[1:42:59] know, a quieter congregation is an
[1:43:00] easier congregation to control.
[1:43:05] That's right. Woo. Y'all done forgot how
[1:43:07] to say amen. I need to help him, I
[1:43:09] guess. Huh? That's right. Keep everybody
[1:43:13] quietened down. You see, there's no
[1:43:14] gifts of the spirit in the church and
[1:43:15] there's nothing for nobody to judge or
[1:43:17] work out or straighten out.
[1:43:20] It's an easier way of doing things.
[1:43:23] People don't have to work as hard
[1:43:25] because if you knew when you come
[1:43:27] through those back doors that you are on
[1:43:28] the clock,
[1:43:30] you are here to serve this body
[1:43:33] and you should be so ready to receive
[1:43:36] any gift that God wants to give you.
[1:43:40] Amen.
[1:43:42] How do you know that you're sitting next
[1:43:44] to that person that you don't normally
[1:43:45] sit next to? At some point during the
[1:43:48] service, the gift of healing wouldn't
[1:43:49] fall into your hands and you lay your
[1:43:51] hand on somebody and God heal them right
[1:43:53] there in the church.
[1:43:56] Praise the Lord, somebody. That's the
[1:43:59] reason why we've got to have the right
[1:44:01] respect for God.
[1:44:04] Gum chewers ain't going to ever feel
[1:44:05] that kind of feeling.
[1:44:07] The note pastors and the talkers and the
[1:44:09] whispers and the irreverent ones are
[1:44:11] never going to experience that from the
[1:44:13] Lord. Which is why we have been
[1:44:15] established as a body of people that we
[1:44:18] come to church knowing this is a place
[1:44:20] where the angels of God come around
[1:44:23] here.
[1:44:24] Amen. Brother said, "I never like
[1:44:26] preaching auditorium. It looked like
[1:44:27] there was devils on every rapture." He
[1:44:28] said, "But I did like a church because
[1:44:30] the angels of the Lord encamped about
[1:44:32] those places."
[1:44:36] Glory to God. How do you know this ain't
[1:44:39] your morning? That that angel of
[1:44:40] deliverance is going to pass by your pew
[1:44:43] and receive. Amen. Hallelujah. And you
[1:44:46] receive everything you've been wanting
[1:44:48] to receive for many, many years.
[1:44:53] So, we got to have respect for God.
[1:44:56] Every part of us must be in a mode of
[1:45:00] respect and fear.
[1:45:02] Modern Christianity
[1:45:06] often emphasizes intimacy with God
[1:45:11] but sometimes many times neglects fear
[1:45:15] for God.
[1:45:17] You see modern day preaching, message
[1:45:20] preaching at that. We're the bride,
[1:45:22] we're the elect, we're going to heaven,
[1:45:23] we're going in the rapture. Glory to
[1:45:25] God. We're the saints. It's true. You're
[1:45:28] the wife of God. Amen.
[1:45:31] If God chose anybody, he chose you.
[1:45:33] Amen.
[1:45:36] But don't leave out of that preaching
[1:45:37] this attribute of fear and respect
[1:45:42] because he may be my husband
[1:45:45] and I may be co-equal with him in
[1:45:47] Christ,
[1:45:49] but I must show him godly reverence or I
[1:45:52] am not the right kind of wife.
[1:45:56] And if we're not careful, that old lady
[1:45:57] of sin thing of arrogance will get on
[1:46:00] us.
[1:46:02] We'll stick our chest out and walk by
[1:46:04] anybody that we don't consider to be the
[1:46:06] elect.
[1:46:10] Disqualify people from being bride just
[1:46:13] cuz we don't think they are. You know
[1:46:16] why people do these things? They've lost
[1:46:18] their fear.
[1:46:21] If we had the right kind of respect that
[1:46:23] God is the one that makes the call on
[1:46:26] who makes it and who don't, including
[1:46:28] me. If we had the right kind of
[1:46:30] reverence. Come on now. If we had the
[1:46:33] right kind of reverence, we would not
[1:46:35] look down our nose at any human being on
[1:46:38] this planet.
[1:46:41] But we don't do it anymore like we used
[1:46:43] to because we've lost that element of
[1:46:45] fear
[1:46:46] that God sees everything I'm doing. Like
[1:46:49] Solomon said here, whether it's good or
[1:46:51] whether it's bad, it'll be judged at the
[1:46:53] day of judgment. That goes for you and
[1:46:55] I, too.
[1:46:57] We may not stand before God as sinners,
[1:46:59] but we will give an account for our
[1:47:02] stewardship in this on this life, on
[1:47:04] this in the on this earth, and in this
[1:47:05] planet.
[1:47:07] Brother said he'll have to answer to God
[1:47:09] for all of them souls that he failed to
[1:47:11] go to after he left Mr. Walker. He said
[1:47:14] he had a fistful of invitations and his
[1:47:16] mother-in-law said, "You ain't taking my
[1:47:18] daughter around that trash."
[1:47:21] And he said, "I listened to my
[1:47:22] mother-in-law instead of God." And he
[1:47:23] said, "I paid for it." And he said,
[1:47:24] "I'll have to answer to God for every
[1:47:26] soul that I failed to go to the first
[1:47:29] time."
[1:47:32] It's hard to preach that way and get
[1:47:33] everybody shouting.
[1:47:36] That's not shouting material.
[1:47:39] It kind of gives you that little jolt of
[1:47:41] uhoh.
[1:47:43] Brother Ram had to do that. What am I
[1:47:44] going to stand there for?
[1:47:48] And I can tell by all the whites of your
[1:47:49] little eyeballs, you're thinking the
[1:47:50] same thing I am. God help me not to have
[1:47:53] to stand there like that.
[1:47:56] But this is why godly fear is so
[1:47:59] essential. A man that is fearful of God.
[1:48:02] You think he would lie and lie on his
[1:48:05] neighbor and tell dirty things and
[1:48:07] gossip and destroy people's influence?
[1:48:12] How could he ever be such a man? If he
[1:48:15] truly had fear for God,
[1:48:18] that is my brother.
[1:48:22] And to speak against him is to speak
[1:48:24] against my own flesh because we are one
[1:48:26] in the body of Christ. That's right.
[1:48:28] Fear would make you check yourself.
[1:48:32] Fear would make you govern your mouth.
[1:48:35] Monitor it.
[1:48:38] [Laughter]
[1:48:40] Woo. That judgment thing got you all
[1:48:41] sober, didn't it? It should. It should.
[1:48:44] It's a serious thing to think about that
[1:48:46] God is paying attention. Now listen,
[1:48:48] he's not a tyrant and he's not
[1:48:50] micromanaging every little move we make,
[1:48:53] waiting for that one little tiny moment
[1:48:54] to say, "I I knew you was nothing out."
[1:48:59] But God demands respects
[1:49:02] out of the elect of God.
[1:49:05] He will not allow us to go to his heaven
[1:49:08] if we don't have this in our character.
[1:49:13] Come on, somebody.
[1:49:15] Come on, somebody.
[1:49:17] This must be a part of our character or
[1:49:19] we won't go. We can say all we want to
[1:49:21] how much we believe the message and we
[1:49:23] love the Lord and all those things. If
[1:49:24] we do not have fear, it will dictate
[1:49:26] other areas of our life that will make
[1:49:28] our character less than.
[1:49:33] Fear of God
[1:49:36] in terms of the Bible is not outdated
[1:49:39] but it is in society.
[1:49:43] Look around at how much people not only
[1:49:47] disrespect God, but they live stream it.
[1:49:55] They have no compunction about putting
[1:49:58] some atheist liar
[1:50:01] in front of the world to blasphe the
[1:50:03] name of Jesus Christ and the church.
[1:50:07] Don't bother them at all. As long as
[1:50:09] they get their hit count and can make
[1:50:11] the money off the showing of the video
[1:50:13] and all that kind, as long as they can
[1:50:14] do that, they're fine.
[1:50:17] Don't bo bother them how much that
[1:50:19] somebody would get out there and tell
[1:50:20] all of these lies on Christianity.
[1:50:25] You understand some years ago when the
[1:50:26] defe when the defectors the the believe
[1:50:28] the sign group and John Collins and
[1:50:30] these other ones come up there publicly.
[1:50:33] Do you think if them men feared God that
[1:50:35] William Brandon was truly God's servant?
[1:50:38] You think they would have broadcast it
[1:50:39] to the world?
[1:50:44] I would have rather had somebody tie
[1:50:46] that piano around my neck and throw me
[1:50:48] in Lake Erie
[1:50:51] than to get out and even say anything
[1:50:54] against another brother even if I
[1:50:56] disagreed with him. Look at brother
[1:50:57] Brandham's attitude. Was that brother
[1:50:58] Brandham's attitude? He knew that a
[1:51:00] Allen was was drinking. He knew that
[1:51:02] Jack Co and him were trinitarians. He
[1:51:04] knew that they were off the mark when it
[1:51:06] came to the word. But listen at the way
[1:51:08] he took up for them men.
[1:51:11] He addressed Billy Graham higher than
[1:51:13] himself or Roberts higher than himself.
[1:51:17] Why did brother Bam do that? Not because
[1:51:19] he was a or a coward or because he
[1:51:22] was some man that didn't want to stand
[1:51:23] up to a fight.
[1:51:27] If Brother Brandham had to make a
[1:51:28] defense of the gospel, he was the
[1:51:30] toughest guy you ever laid your eyes on.
[1:51:32] But he done this because it was out of
[1:51:34] reverence and fear.
[1:51:37] That man is doing something for God. I'm
[1:51:40] not gonna speak against it.
[1:51:45] Which one of those people that's left
[1:51:47] the message or which one of these people
[1:51:48] that get up and blast the message and
[1:51:50] these how many of you here get him say
[1:51:52] things like brother Bram did when he
[1:51:54] goes to preach a message called he that
[1:51:56] is in you. And he said now I want to
[1:51:58] apologize for something I did this
[1:52:00] morning. I called a brother's name
[1:52:02] publicly and I shouldn't have done that.
[1:52:07] Can you not see the difference of
[1:52:09] character
[1:52:11] where other people on the internet
[1:52:13] they're they're immediately the first
[1:52:15] thing they do when they get a little
[1:52:17] piece of dirt
[1:52:19] they go straight to the website.
[1:52:23] Listen brother, there's a lot of itites
[1:52:24] we're going to have to conquer in the
[1:52:25] last day and websites are one of them.
[1:52:32] Hello.
[1:52:34] Are you saying, "Brother Ben, you
[1:52:35] shouldn't say it. With all these young
[1:52:36] people sitting here, you crazy."
[1:52:40] They need to know that God still wants
[1:52:43] fear and reverence in the house of God.
[1:52:50] Amen.
[1:52:52] When we see people get up on Facebook
[1:52:55] and call that one's name and on social
[1:52:57] media, call that one's name to expose
[1:52:59] that one, don't they realize what
[1:53:01] they're doing? Every idle word will be
[1:53:04] given account for in the day of
[1:53:06] judgment.
[1:53:10] And by your words you'll be justified or
[1:53:12] by your words you'll be condemned. So
[1:53:14] you better make them real sweet cuz one
[1:53:15] day you may have to eat them.
[1:53:23] Can you imagine how people must feel
[1:53:27] that have departed from this life and
[1:53:28] have went into the regions of the lost?
[1:53:31] Brother Bham said they know on earth
[1:53:33] when it's Christmas time. So certainly
[1:53:35] they must know when it's election time
[1:53:37] and when it's other times in seasons.
[1:53:40] I wonder how Marilyn Monroe and Elvis
[1:53:42] and them people feel
[1:53:44] when they get up on their broadcast and
[1:53:46] call him the king of rock and roll. I
[1:53:48] wonder if all shook up is still shook
[1:53:50] up.
[1:53:54] What would they tell us
[1:53:57] if they could crawl back into this
[1:53:59] church this morning and take this
[1:54:01] pullpit and testify?
[1:54:04] You know what they tell you? Money ain't
[1:54:06] worth it. Popularity ain't worth it.
[1:54:08] Beauty ain't worth it. Sex ain't worth
[1:54:10] it. Accolades and and and awards ain't
[1:54:14] worth it. The only thing that is worth
[1:54:16] it, fear God and keep his commandments.
[1:54:21] For this is the whole duty
[1:54:27] and given to you by one master.
[1:54:33] Now let's let's look at a couple things.
[1:54:36] Read with me Proverbs 9:10.
[1:54:40] Fear is not outdated according to the
[1:54:42] Bible, but it is according to society.
[1:54:44] It's oldfashioned.
[1:54:46] That's the reason why women dress like
[1:54:47] they dress, men do like they do and
[1:54:49] dress like they dress and act like they
[1:54:51] act. That's why people h have enough
[1:54:52] tattoos on them to make clothing.
[1:54:56] Their ears this big around from them
[1:54:57] gauges they put in there. I saw a guy a
[1:54:59] guy that they come walking had a thing
[1:55:00] in his lip. Is it this big around? I
[1:55:03] said, "Lord God, how does he eat soup
[1:55:05] with that thing?"
[1:55:10] But when you look at the way people
[1:55:11] behave,
[1:55:13] you tell them the Bible said not to mark
[1:55:15] your body like ah that's that old old
[1:55:17] testament stuff. You see what kind of
[1:55:18] fear they've got? Even if it is Old
[1:55:21] Testament, I'd want to reverence God
[1:55:23] enough to say, Lord, how how how does
[1:55:26] that apply to me today?
[1:55:32] Proverbs 9:10, the fear of the Lord is
[1:55:36] the
[1:55:42] So, how do I start with this?
[1:55:46] Anything I want to do for the Lord right
[1:55:49] here's my beginning.
[1:55:52] Be it play music, sing a song,
[1:55:55] preach, help somebody in the church, to
[1:55:58] be a blessing, anything I want to do for
[1:56:00] the Lord. This is my beginning right
[1:56:02] here. the fear of the Lord to respect
[1:56:06] God enough to say, "Lord, what do you
[1:56:08] think about it?"
[1:56:15] Amen.
[1:56:17] It's the beginning of wisdom and the
[1:56:18] knowledge of the holy
[1:56:22] is understanding. So you see what fear
[1:56:24] brings you? Fear brings understanding.
[1:56:27] Fear brings wisdom. Fear brings
[1:56:29] revelation. Fear brings stability. Amen.
[1:56:34] You know where your feet are landing
[1:56:36] when you have fear. The right kind of
[1:56:38] fear for God.
[1:56:41] Let's look at u Malachi 1 verse 6.
[1:56:46] Well, I love the Bible. Don't you? So
[1:56:48] many rich little nuggets in here.
[1:56:51] Malachi 1:6.
[1:56:53] And watch this. Is God's attitude.
[1:56:56] The people had so moved away from the
[1:56:58] things of God. Watch this. A son honorth
[1:57:01] his father and a servant his master.
[1:57:06] If then I be a father, where is mine
[1:57:09] honor?
[1:57:12] And if I be a master,
[1:57:14] where is my fear? Sayaith the Lord of
[1:57:16] hosts unto you.
[1:57:18] Can you imagine how this must have made
[1:57:20] God feel to see these people? These
[1:57:22] people right here that he's talking to.
[1:57:23] These are the ones that have kept the
[1:57:25] new moons, the Sabbath, the feast days.
[1:57:28] They still go into the temple. They
[1:57:30] still sacrifice.
[1:57:31] They still do everything they're
[1:57:33] supposed to do.
[1:57:35] And God said, "It's become such a
[1:57:37] routine
[1:57:39] till it stinks in my nostrils."
[1:57:42] Well, you think if God was such a
[1:57:43] legalist like people have made him out
[1:57:44] to be, he would love them for the things
[1:57:46] they're doing. So why why Israel? You
[1:57:49] you you you've got the right red heer
[1:57:51] and the sacrifice is right. Woo! Boy, I
[1:57:54] tell you, that priest, man, he he can
[1:57:56] light them candles with those seven
[1:57:57] sticks like no other priest.
[1:58:01] Everything they do is perfect.
[1:58:04] And God said, "It's still a stink." Am I
[1:58:06] not? You know why? Because you can do
[1:58:07] the right thing all the time and do it
[1:58:10] without your heart behind it. And God
[1:58:12] ain't interested in it.
[1:58:16] That almost sounds mean, don't it?
[1:58:19] Like to you sisters, you know, about not
[1:58:21] cutting your hair and things like that.
[1:58:23] You say, "Well, Lord, I've sacrificed
[1:58:24] and I've not cut my" You see, this is
[1:58:26] what happens when people start
[1:58:27] backsliding. Women specifically, well,
[1:58:30] I've lived this whole life. I've never
[1:58:32] worn makeup. I've never cut my hair.
[1:58:33] I've never put a pair of trousers on.
[1:58:36] And the second they backslide, first
[1:58:37] thing they do is they go cut their hair,
[1:58:39] put trousers on, wear makeup. Why?
[1:58:41] Because deep down within them, they
[1:58:44] thought that them dressing right and so
[1:58:46] forth would have been enough to please
[1:58:48] God. It's not.
[1:58:53] Well, here we go.
[1:58:56] I've preached to you long enough. I know
[1:58:58] where I'm standing at on this.
[1:59:01] Because some of y'all got this idea in
[1:59:02] your head, and you have for many years,
[1:59:04] that if a person dresses right and lives
[1:59:06] like a Christian, that makes them a
[1:59:07] Christian. Uh, if I went over and stood
[1:59:09] in a barn, does that make me a horse? If
[1:59:11] I stood in a in a garage, does that make
[1:59:13] me a car?
[1:59:15] No. No. If I crawled inside that organ,
[1:59:17] does that make me a transistor? No.
[1:59:22] Just because you do ride, doesn't mean
[1:59:24] you are right.
[1:59:29] Brother Ram said, "A prostitute could
[1:59:31] walk on the platform, have enough faith
[1:59:34] to get healed, and walk off completely
[1:59:37] healed." And he said, "The staunch
[1:59:38] Christian walk up here and walk out with
[1:59:41] nothing."
[1:59:42] Because it's not about the way you look
[1:59:44] on the outside. It's the condition of
[1:59:46] your heart first.
[1:59:49] First,
[1:59:52] boys and girls, that doesn't mean we
[1:59:53] don't want you to live right and dress
[1:59:55] right. We want you to. But more than
[1:59:57] that, as ministry, we want you to
[1:59:59] understand why.
[2:00:04] Why does a woman not cut her hair? Why
[2:00:05] does a man not run around on his wife?
[2:00:08] Why does a person not go get drunk? Come
[2:00:11] on.
[2:00:14] Because we live our life in the
[2:00:17] beginning of our wisdom. We learn to
[2:00:20] fear God first.
[2:00:23] And that fear brought us to a a a
[2:00:25] position to where we could say, "Okay,
[2:00:27] Lord, then then how do you want me to
[2:00:29] dress?" That fear uh uh uh Lord, how do
[2:00:32] you want me to think? I I I never will
[2:00:35] forget some years ago over in Cookville,
[2:00:36] Tennessee, Brother Mike Sever from
[2:00:38] Dayton, the one that's the believer's
[2:00:40] youth camp, the one that run it for many
[2:00:41] years. M Mike Mike and I Mike Mike's
[2:00:43] known me since before I was born and
[2:00:45] that literally before I was born this
[2:00:46] guy's known me and we was running a
[2:00:50] revival in Cookville. We put a tent up
[2:00:52] and went out there was trying to win
[2:00:53] some of the people in the area and this
[2:00:55] old boy had come in and he just got
[2:00:57] saved. He was an apostolic kid and he
[2:01:00] said he he didn't know nothing about
[2:01:01] God. Nothing. Didn't know didn't know a
[2:01:03] scripture in the Bible from one for the
[2:01:04] other but he gave his heart to God and
[2:01:06] he got saved. And so he was going
[2:01:08] through the factory one day and said,
[2:01:10] you know, he used to cuss and watch
[2:01:11] sports and things like that and whatever
[2:01:13] and whatever and whatever and said, you
[2:01:15] know, he said it went on and went on
[2:01:16] went on and said they finally asked him,
[2:01:17] well, how is it with this Jesus of
[2:01:18] yours? He said, well, first of all, I
[2:01:19] know he don't like swearing and I'm kind
[2:01:21] of thinking he don't like football
[2:01:22] either.
[2:01:29] And as silly as that sounds to you and I
[2:01:32] as mature Christians, yet that boy had
[2:01:35] an element of something that many people
[2:01:37] have lost in this message. And that was
[2:01:40] that touch of fear. Lord, am I doing
[2:01:43] something that might displease you? Am I
[2:01:45] would I watch something that you
[2:01:46] wouldn't like? Or would I thank
[2:01:48] something, act something, do something,
[2:01:50] hang around someone?
[2:01:52] And if we had just that simple little
[2:01:55] simple touch, Brother Joe, of that in
[2:01:57] our lives, even right now, how much
[2:02:00] cleaner would we live? How much nicer
[2:02:02] would we talk? How much more of a
[2:02:03] gentleman and lady would we be? Come on
[2:02:05] now, preach to me.
[2:02:08] Amen. It would take us way yawn farther
[2:02:11] than anything else we could do.
[2:02:15] Cuz you could build up a datab bank of
[2:02:17] revelation and not have fear. It means
[2:02:20] nothing.
[2:02:25] So God tells them,
[2:02:27] "I want my reverence and I want my
[2:02:29] fear."
[2:02:31] You take a couple chapters over from
[2:02:33] this, you go to the third chapter of
[2:02:34] Malachi, and he starts talking to him
[2:02:36] about tithes and offerings.
[2:02:39] Wonder why he was talking about things
[2:02:40] like that. Why would God, who needs no
[2:02:43] money, last I know, he don't have a
[2:02:45] checking account or a debit card.
[2:02:48] We don't barter with him and we sure
[2:02:50] don't trade with him. Why would God want
[2:02:53] us to give a tenth of our income and
[2:02:54] give an offering into the church?
[2:03:00] He's the one that gave us power to get
[2:03:01] wealth
[2:03:03] and he wants us to show our respects to
[2:03:06] him by giving back to the body.
[2:03:15] Amen.
[2:03:19] It's a simple thing.
[2:03:22] But here the Lord is asking these people
[2:03:23] in Malachi, why don't you reverence me?
[2:03:28] We've robbed God. He said, "How did you
[2:03:29] rob him?" He said, "And your tithes and
[2:03:32] your offerings."
[2:03:35] These were churchgoing people. These
[2:03:37] were people that went to the temple.
[2:03:39] They had the name put on the book that
[2:03:41] you know this little certain sin and
[2:03:42] they'd have it washed out and if they
[2:03:44] came back the next year they were stoned
[2:03:46] without mercy. They had everything to
[2:03:47] the letter of the law and God called
[2:03:50] them thieves. He called them
[2:03:52] disrespectful.
[2:03:53] [Laughter]
[2:03:56] Woo. There are message people frying
[2:03:57] like eggs all over this country right
[2:03:59] now. This kind of preaching
[2:04:02] because that's the idea that we've got.
[2:04:04] We've got this idea that oh I'm a good
[2:04:06] little message guy. Okay.
[2:04:09] But how much do you respect God in every
[2:04:12] area of your life?
[2:04:15] You want to know how spiritual you are?
[2:04:16] Check it there. That's a good spiritual
[2:04:19] thermometer for you to check the
[2:04:22] temperature of how you live your life.
[2:04:23] Not just tithes and offerings, but all
[2:04:25] these little tiny things that we ignore.
[2:04:31] Isaiah chapter 8 verse 13.
[2:04:34] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:37] Everybody still happy?
[2:04:40] If you are, you're doing good.
[2:04:42] Hey, listen. I wouldn't bring messages
[2:04:44] like this to Elton if I didn't think
[2:04:45] y'all could handle it. You know, some of
[2:04:47] these on the front row, they've heard me
[2:04:48] preach other places. I'm a little nicer
[2:04:50] in other spots, aren't I?
[2:04:52] Now, watch this. Now, Isaiah 8 and 13.
[2:04:56] Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself.
[2:04:58] Watch this. Let him be your fear
[2:05:03] and let him be your dread.
[2:05:09] One writer said, "The fear of God is the
[2:05:11] soul of godliness."
[2:05:15] Another man, aweser, said, "When men do
[2:05:18] not fear God, they give themselves to
[2:05:20] evil."
[2:05:22] Pretty good statements from some of
[2:05:23] these preachers, these writers.
[2:05:26] The very fear of God, the fear that we
[2:05:28] have, the reverence we have is the soul,
[2:05:31] the heart of all godliness.
[2:05:34] Why would a man do what he does and live
[2:05:36] as he lives without fear? How could he
[2:05:39] do it?
[2:05:42] What stops you from just living any way
[2:05:44] you want to live out here in America?
[2:05:46] That fell with them lights up there.
[2:05:51] What happens when people lose their
[2:05:52] respect for the law? They wind up in
[2:05:55] prison. They wind up in jail
[2:05:58] or dead.
[2:06:01] And you see people nowadays, watch them.
[2:06:03] Just you social media users, just go
[2:06:05] down when you were going through your
[2:06:06] reels and look, just look at how many of
[2:06:08] these things pop up every now and then
[2:06:10] about people cussing the police out and
[2:06:12] tell them to leave them alone and you're
[2:06:14] transgressing my rights and on and on
[2:06:17] and on. You know what? They've lost such
[2:06:19] a fear for the law of this land that we
[2:06:22] are on the verge of lawlessness. All
[2:06:24] it's going to take is for one right
[2:06:26] tipping point and this place will turn
[2:06:28] into anarchy.
[2:06:33] Oh, you say it won't. I know you think
[2:06:35] that because the same guy you voted is
[2:06:37] the same guy I voted in.
[2:06:40] But in case you didn't see, there was
[2:06:42] also another vote conducted over in
[2:06:44] Italy just a little bit ago, and that is
[2:06:46] prophecy and action. We've now had
[2:06:49] according to the book of revelation and
[2:06:51] according to brother Brandham the first
[2:06:53] pope voted in from the United States of
[2:06:56] America that is a signpost of how close
[2:06:59] we are to the end.
[2:07:02] [Applause]
[2:07:05] Right?
[2:07:09] You know in other translations in
[2:07:10] Spanish and different ones the brethren
[2:07:12] they get confused in Africa and
[2:07:14] different places because they use the
[2:07:15] word America. There's a lot of America,
[2:07:18] North America, South America, Central
[2:07:20] America. But he didn't say in the Acts
[2:07:22] of the Holy Spirit 54, he didn't say the
[2:07:24] first pope from America. He said from
[2:07:27] the United States.
[2:07:30] And that is Revelation 13:11.
[2:07:33] And the image of the beast is this great
[2:07:37] land
[2:07:39] of the United States of America.
[2:07:43] So let them magga all they want to.
[2:07:46] They'll make it great. You better
[2:07:47] believe they will. They'll make it so
[2:07:49] great until you can't even buy or sell
[2:07:52] unless you have that name or that mark
[2:07:54] on you.
[2:07:57] Well, hallelujah.
[2:08:00] Now, maybe some of you planning to be
[2:08:01] here to see it. I ain't. I plan on going
[2:08:04] home with Jesus.
[2:08:08] Right.
[2:08:13] Don't put your hope in this nation. I'm
[2:08:15] happy to see him doing something good
[2:08:16] for the people. I'm especially happy to
[2:08:18] see him getting rid of all this DEI
[2:08:20] nonsense.
[2:08:22] I'm sick to death of transgenderism and
[2:08:24] this stuff everywhere I look. Amen.
[2:08:28] I got enough problem being ugly, much
[2:08:30] less all the other problems I got.
[2:08:34] Hold your peace, Sam. I know what you're
[2:08:36] thinking.
[2:08:37] [Laughter]
[2:08:39] I'm going to hear in the car, "You ain't
[2:08:41] ugly. Don't you ever say that again.
[2:08:44] Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I
[2:08:46] suppose.
[2:08:49] But the climate we're living in,
[2:08:53] people will begin getting under an
[2:08:54] anointing. You understand that? And the
[2:08:56] anointing that they're going to get
[2:08:57] under is this anointing of unity?
[2:09:02] And they'll show such reverence and fear
[2:09:04] to the beast because America will be
[2:09:06] empowered to speak just like Rome did in
[2:09:09] the old days.
[2:09:14] until people will be dictated and
[2:09:16] controlled.
[2:09:20] And the only way you're going to escape
[2:09:22] it is you're going to have to be in
[2:09:24] Christ.
[2:09:27] And the only way you can get there is
[2:09:30] you've got to have respects for him.
[2:09:38] Think of it like this.
[2:09:42] True worship
[2:09:45] is not casual
[2:09:49] but costly.
[2:09:52] Dwell on that for a minute with me. True
[2:09:54] worship is not casual
[2:09:57] but costly.
[2:09:59] To be a true worshshiper of God, it
[2:10:03] costs you something.
[2:10:06] You are going to have to pay a price
[2:10:09] somewhere.
[2:10:11] to be a true worshipper of God. Now,
[2:10:14] modern day churches tell, "Oh, you don't
[2:10:16] there's no sacrifice. You just serve the
[2:10:18] Lord and uphour some evils and love
[2:10:21] God." And
[2:10:24] it's just such a casual
[2:10:27] living for the Lord. And that casualness
[2:10:31] has no price tag with it.
[2:10:35] So, a woman can dress any way she wants.
[2:10:36] A man can dress any way he wants, talk
[2:10:38] any way they want, think any way they
[2:10:39] want, act any way they want, and there's
[2:10:41] no cost associated with it all. That's
[2:10:44] right. But sister, you know as well as I
[2:10:46] do, anytime you walk into Walmart,
[2:10:48] you're paying a price.
[2:10:51] Because any of you girls know when you
[2:10:52] go in and out of the store, you've done
[2:10:54] been given the once over a thousand
[2:10:55] different times from all the people
[2:10:57] looking at you like you're some kind of
[2:10:58] an alien from Mars.
[2:11:01] And you think that don't some of the
[2:11:03] older ones, you may have gotten over
[2:11:04] that, but you think it don't affect
[2:11:05] these young boys and girls. You think it
[2:11:08] don't affect our young people that just
[2:11:10] want to be a part and not to be
[2:11:12] ostracized, not to be excluded, not to
[2:11:14] be looked at as some kind of a strange
[2:11:16] weird antique.
[2:11:19] It affects their mind.
[2:11:22] This is the reason why the world pulls
[2:11:24] so hard on them this direction and why
[2:11:28] so many times in our very own homes we
[2:11:30] battle worldliness with our kids and
[2:11:32] everything else because of the pull that
[2:11:34] we fear out there that we feel out
[2:11:36] there. But the thing that would reverse
[2:11:38] all of that in your children in your
[2:11:40] homes in your mothers in your fathers
[2:11:42] and everybody else is if the whole
[2:11:44] household practice having respect and
[2:11:47] fear for God.
[2:11:51] The reason we do it is because the Lord
[2:11:53] is watching us.
[2:11:59] If we preached holiness from this view,
[2:12:03] from this perspective right here,
[2:12:04] Brother Brad, if we preached it from
[2:12:06] here, from that that spot, I believe it
[2:12:10] would be a lot easier for the people to
[2:12:12] swallow down, brother Ber, what we
[2:12:14] preached to them if they could
[2:12:15] understand that why.
[2:12:20] But here how it's been presented through
[2:12:22] the years. Maybe not just here, but in
[2:12:24] general. You better not cut your hair or
[2:12:26] you'll go to hell. You better not wear
[2:12:28] britches, women, or you'll go to hell,
[2:12:30] boys. You keep them shorts off your
[2:12:32] body.
[2:12:34] It's preached to us almost like
[2:12:38] in the same spirit that's going to be
[2:12:40] anointing the nation in the end, a
[2:12:42] dictator type anointing.
[2:12:46] And we never present to the people.
[2:12:48] Well, I shouldn't say never, but when
[2:12:49] these things are preached, never do you
[2:12:51] hear from that kind of platform.
[2:12:52] Somebody's, "Hey, hey." But God is a God
[2:12:55] of mercy. He understands if you get
[2:12:56] weak. He understands if you get pulled
[2:12:59] on by the world. He understands if you
[2:13:00] mess up and do things wrong over and
[2:13:02] over again.
[2:13:09] But what we hear is, "You better do it
[2:13:10] right." Glory to God. You better do it
[2:13:12] right or you're going to hell.
[2:13:17] I do not preach holiness to people
[2:13:19] because I'm afraid they'll go to hell. I
[2:13:22] preach holiness because I'm afraid
[2:13:24] they'll insult my Lord
[2:13:27] and because I fear that they'll grieve
[2:13:29] his presence away from them to where he
[2:13:32] won't want to visit their doorstep
[2:13:34] anymore.
[2:13:41] So, I do everything I can not to present
[2:13:43] him in a way of a micromanager.
[2:13:47] I'm taking notes on you, Joe.
[2:13:50] Glory to God. You better keep
[2:13:51] everything. I mean, everything, boy. You
[2:13:53] better keep it right.
[2:13:56] If that's the way it was, we'd all be a
[2:13:58] bunch of neurotics.
[2:14:00] We would never be able to serve him in
[2:14:01] joy. We'd never be able to serve him in
[2:14:03] peace. How could you have peace when you
[2:14:06] think he's monitoring every little
[2:14:07] twitch of your eye?
[2:14:10] Thank God he don't do that.
[2:14:13] That's not the kind of God he is. That's
[2:14:15] not the kind of person he is.
[2:14:20] As I preached to you some time ago last
[2:14:22] year, Jesus is not the kind of man that
[2:14:25] watches you make a mistake and always
[2:14:27] jumps right in to stop you from the
[2:14:29] thing. Nor does he come behind you and
[2:14:31] condemn you with the wrath of God.
[2:14:34] If you look at your life even this
[2:14:35] morning, there are many things that
[2:14:37] you're still battling with that you do
[2:14:38] it again and again and again and repent
[2:14:40] again and again and again. And yet
[2:14:42] there's been no lightning bolt since
[2:14:43] your way to the top of your head.
[2:14:46] There's been no judging angel stand
[2:14:48] there. You do it again. Glory to God.
[2:14:50] You're going to hell. There's been none
[2:14:51] of that. Why? He gives us the time and
[2:14:54] the patience that we need to work it out
[2:14:57] with fear and trembling
[2:15:00] to keep fighting, to keep learning, to
[2:15:03] keep struggling. Oh,
[2:15:06] if there's anything to make you shout,
[2:15:08] that should have been a shouting point.
[2:15:10] Yes, sir. To think that God will
[2:15:12] absolutely give you time and patience to
[2:15:15] learn how to overcome that thing.
[2:15:19] He don't throw you in hell for the first
[2:15:20] little mistake. And the one you make
[2:15:22] again and again and again, he still
[2:15:23] don't throw you in hell for it.
[2:15:27] But you'll open the Bible and read a
[2:15:28] scripture. There it is. You go to
[2:15:30] church. You'll preach. There it is.
[2:15:33] You'll be driving down the road and
[2:15:34] something will be said, "Oh, there it is
[2:15:35] again." He'll remind you over and over
[2:15:39] and over again, "You need to deal with
[2:15:41] this. You need to deal with this. You
[2:15:44] need to you need to figure out a way to
[2:15:45] overcome this. You need to deal with
[2:15:46] this." But he don't throw us in hell.
[2:15:48] The only time that he gets really angry
[2:15:50] with us is when we're just plum being
[2:15:52] stubborn.
[2:15:56] Words. Amen. In case you forgot it.
[2:16:00] We get bullheaded. That's when we get a
[2:16:02] whipping. Amen. But as long as you're
[2:16:05] willing to try, he's willing to give you
[2:16:07] the patience and the grace you need to
[2:16:09] overcome it every day of your life.
[2:16:13] Amen. Why? because he has got the same
[2:16:16] kind of fear for you that he demands of
[2:16:19] for himself.
[2:16:22] He respects you and reverences you as
[2:16:25] the bride of Christ
[2:16:29] and he shows respect to your position
[2:16:32] for who you are. That's the reason he
[2:16:35] don't bail us out of every little thing
[2:16:36] that moves. He knows who you are.
[2:16:39] He created you. He gave you his Holy
[2:16:42] Ghost. He birthed you by the spirit. He
[2:16:44] put your name on the book before the
[2:16:45] lamb's book of uh before the foundation
[2:16:47] of the world. He done all the He knows
[2:16:49] exactly who you are and what you're
[2:16:50] capable of. And yet we are the biggest
[2:16:52] babies sometimes. Me too. Oh God, why
[2:16:54] don't you do this? And Lord, if you're
[2:16:56] God, why don't
[2:16:59] he shows us the same respect that we
[2:17:02] should be showing him.
[2:17:04] When we ask him for something, he's God.
[2:17:07] And so when we ask him for something, we
[2:17:09] show him the respect of saying, 'Lord,
[2:17:12] in your time and in your season, you do
[2:17:13] what you need to do.
[2:17:16] Well, you know what? Reverse that just
[2:17:17] on the other way around. He knows you're
[2:17:19] a Christian. He knows you're born again.
[2:17:21] He knows you've got stuff in you that
[2:17:23] the devil can't bluff. Hallelujah.
[2:17:26] Amen. And he knows, give you enough time
[2:17:30] and you'll put that thing under your
[2:17:32] feet.
[2:17:36] Amen.
[2:17:38] You see, real reverence to God
[2:17:41] is the fuel
[2:17:44] for our praise.
[2:17:47] You see, don't shout any higher and you
[2:17:49] live, quote, right? I I respect that
[2:17:51] quote. I thank the Lord for it. Don't
[2:17:53] jump any higher and you you live. Good,
[2:17:56] wonderful quote. But if I know that I
[2:17:59] reverence and fear God enough that if I
[2:18:00] do something wrong, I repent for it and
[2:18:02] I make it right and it goes underneath
[2:18:04] the blood of Jesus Christ, then the
[2:18:06] reverence that I've shown God to repent
[2:18:08] for the thing is also my fuel to come
[2:18:10] back into church and jump just as high
[2:18:12] as I want to jump and praise just as
[2:18:15] high as I want to praise.
[2:18:20] Amen.
[2:18:22] Remember,
[2:18:24] fear and love are not opposites.
[2:18:29] And I put a note down here like this.
[2:18:31] They're allies in devotion.
[2:18:35] Fear and love are not enemies.
[2:18:37] They're allies.
[2:18:39] Fear and love confederate together to
[2:18:41] fight for you,
[2:18:43] not against you. Because if you've got
[2:18:46] the right kind of fear, you'll have the
[2:18:48] right kind of love. Not for just him,
[2:18:51] but for all your brothers and sisters.
[2:18:57] Because here's the thing. When somebody
[2:18:58] does something wrong, why won't we let
[2:19:00] them repent? Why? When somebody messes
[2:19:03] up, why don't we let people repent? If
[2:19:06] they say they're sorry, then we should
[2:19:08] be like, "God, I I I'm putting out of my
[2:19:10] mind." The Lord forgives you, I forgive
[2:19:12] you.
[2:19:14] Why do we keep a compendium,
[2:19:16] a library of things that people have
[2:19:18] done in our life? We bring it up. over
[2:19:20] and over. I'll tell you, I remember when
[2:19:22] that sorry thing and old so so done.
[2:19:24] I'll let you know one thing and another.
[2:19:26] Hallelujah.
[2:19:29] [Laughter]
[2:19:32] Why don't we let him repent? Because
[2:19:35] we're not exercising the right kind of
[2:19:37] fear. Cuz it's like that thing that
[2:19:40] Jesus told about the man that was
[2:19:42] forgiven a little bit and said that guy
[2:19:45] that owed a whole lot
[2:19:47] came back and he said, "I'm going to
[2:19:49] throw you into jail." And things like
[2:19:50] that and and and he said that little guy
[2:19:54] that owed here this guy owed all these
[2:19:56] great great debts and then this little
[2:19:57] guy owed hardly nothing. And the Bible
[2:19:59] said he took him by the throat
[2:20:02] and said, "Pay me what you owe me."
[2:20:04] Amen. And the message came back. I
[2:20:07] forgave you of a lot and you wouldn't
[2:20:10] even forgive this guy of a little.
[2:20:13] Whether we realize it or not, when we
[2:20:14] keep a record of what people has done
[2:20:16] wrong, we are show we the fingerprints
[2:20:18] of your hand, your paw is around their
[2:20:21] throat.
[2:20:23] Again, why don't we let people repent
[2:20:25] because we don't have the right kind of
[2:20:27] fear?
[2:20:29] If God's forgiven them, then I'm
[2:20:31] obligated to forgive them, too. Amen.
[2:20:35] I I I know this is a bad name to bring
[2:20:37] up in the pull pit, but Jimmy Swagger,
[2:20:38] poor Jimmy, laying on life support now.
[2:20:42] You know, the first time he went out and
[2:20:43] done something wrong many, many years
[2:20:45] ago before any of y'all was born, I was
[2:20:46] little.
[2:20:48] He went out and he done a little thing
[2:20:49] wrong. And of course, he done wrong. And
[2:20:54] he got out in front of the world. I
[2:20:56] don't know if this is where they use
[2:20:57] their little trick. You know, they used
[2:20:58] to keep a little glass of lemon juice.
[2:21:00] Did you know this? They take a pencil,
[2:21:02] dip in that lemon juice, touch it their
[2:21:04] eye, and that's how they got their
[2:21:05] tears. Used to be an old charismatic
[2:21:07] Pentecostal preacher trick.
[2:21:10] I don't know if he was using the lemon
[2:21:11] juice, but he sure cried.
[2:21:14] I've sinned. Forgive me. Forgive me. But
[2:21:16] I like what he said the second time
[2:21:17] around. He messed up and done something
[2:21:18] again. Now, mind you, there's a lot of
[2:21:21] other things I could say along with
[2:21:22] this, but I'm just emphasizing,
[2:21:23] highlighting this one point. The second
[2:21:25] time around, he said, "God told me to
[2:21:26] tell you it ain't none of your
[2:21:28] business."
[2:21:30] Amen.
[2:21:31] You sweep your steps, I'll sweep mine.
[2:21:36] I'm not allowed to hold it against you
[2:21:39] if God ain't going to hold it against
[2:21:41] me.
[2:21:42] Who among us has a right to throw a
[2:21:44] stone at somebody else?
[2:21:48] [Applause]
[2:21:51] Oh, these amens ought to be at shouting
[2:21:52] level right now.
[2:21:57] real fear
[2:21:59] would keep us from behaving like that.
[2:22:03] Let me read you to me now the stat of
[2:22:04] perfect man said let's add to our faith
[2:22:07] these things he said then we might come
[2:22:09] into the full stature of Christ being
[2:22:12] joined together with godly love fear of
[2:22:14] God reverence in our heart to one
[2:22:16] another deep respects to one another
[2:22:20] brotherly and sisterly kindness never
[2:22:22] vulgarity nothing but just purity of
[2:22:25] Holy Ghost living see lives together be
[2:22:27] a Christian walk in faith he said let
[2:22:30] the virtue of God flow through you let
[2:22:32] the knowledge of God when it comes to
[2:22:34] right or wrong. And when the devil
[2:22:36] presents something that's not exactly
[2:22:37] scriptural, walk away from it. That's
[2:22:40] right. He says,
[2:22:42] this is the character of Christ. Look at
[2:22:44] how the character of Christ is tied to
[2:22:47] fear.
[2:22:49] Not just reverencing God, but
[2:22:51] reverencing one another. Again, Hebrews
[2:22:54] 12 28 and 29. Now, can I get just a few
[2:22:58] more minutes of your time? All right.
[2:23:00] But I'm I'm watching my clock up here on
[2:23:01] my tablet. So hopefully I I won't hold
[2:23:03] you any later in about 3:00 4:00
[2:23:05] something like that. It'll be all right.
[2:23:07] Be all right. I ain't killed nobody yet
[2:23:09] yet.
[2:23:11] Hebrews 12:28. Let me just go just a
[2:23:14] little bit further because I promise you
[2:23:15] some things on holiness. Wherefore we
[2:23:17] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[2:23:19] moved. Let us have grace. Watch this.
[2:23:23] whereby we may serve God acceptably
[2:23:27] with reverence and godly fear.
[2:23:33] For our God is a consuming fire.
[2:23:37] Amen.
[2:23:41] Notice the the word that he uses here
[2:23:44] for reverence
[2:23:46] is the word in Greek eddios.
[2:23:50] It almost looks like Spanish edios, like
[2:23:52] goodbye.
[2:23:54] This word means
[2:23:56] it only appears twice in the New
[2:23:58] Testament. Appears here in Hebrews and
[2:24:00] then in 1 Timothy 2:9
[2:24:02] where Paul uses the woman's modesty, the
[2:24:05] shamefacedness,
[2:24:07] addios.
[2:24:09] And this word appears these two times in
[2:24:12] the New Testament which means literally
[2:24:16] to avert one's eyes
[2:24:19] in reverence or awe.
[2:24:23] In other words, something that is so
[2:24:25] sacred, so weighty, so glorious
[2:24:29] that you can't even look deeply at it
[2:24:31] without a sense of humility striking
[2:24:34] your heart.
[2:24:37] But this is more than modesty. The
[2:24:39] meaning of this word is inward grace
[2:24:43] that guards outward behavior.
[2:24:49] Now preach holiness.
[2:24:52] Huh? Now preach holiness.
[2:24:56] If a person has that godly fear, that
[2:25:00] inward grace that is in their heart will
[2:25:03] govern what they do on the outside. Woo!
[2:25:06] Hallelujah.
[2:25:09] This is the reason why you hear brother
[2:25:11] Brandham going back and forth between
[2:25:12] Christmas, whether a woman should wear
[2:25:14] jewelry and not wear jewelry, and
[2:25:15] whether Rebecca can wear a riding skirt,
[2:25:17] and on and on and on. You know why?
[2:25:20] Brother Bram wasn't a legalist like many
[2:25:22] people made him out to be.
[2:25:24] That's why you can see photographs with
[2:25:26] Rebecca and Mey and the dresses were
[2:25:28] right at their knees and they had god
[2:25:30] forbid a little heel on their shoe.
[2:25:35] Don't pass out some of y'all. I know
[2:25:36] some that's tough preaching for some of
[2:25:37] y'all.
[2:25:43] That's why you can see brother Brandham
[2:25:44] in Africa dressed in the pygmy outfit
[2:25:46] with the little shorts below his leg.
[2:25:48] Right?
[2:25:50] Cuz brother Brandham didn't walk around.
[2:25:51] Excuse this. God in heaven. Excuse this.
[2:25:54] Like a bunch of these imbeciles around
[2:25:56] the message that think they are too holy
[2:25:58] to even chew.
[2:26:03] Can't even drink water without sinning.
[2:26:06] Woo.
[2:26:10] At this point, I don't even need him.
[2:26:16] This is why when holiness is preached
[2:26:18] many times in our churches, this is why
[2:26:21] people shun away from truth.
[2:26:26] Because the world gives them a bunch of
[2:26:28] rules, when to clock in, when to go to
[2:26:30] bed. Young people hear it from their
[2:26:32] parents. Get out of the bed. Make
[2:26:33] something out of yourself. Go to work
[2:26:35] and get a job. And then when it comes to
[2:26:37] serving God, they feel like they're just
[2:26:39] being trained in another pointless camp.
[2:26:46] [Music]
[2:26:49] Brother Brandham had a Christmas tree.
[2:26:53] Oh. Oh, I'm starting to fight. No, I'm
[2:26:56] trying to explain to you the reason
[2:26:57] Brother Brandham did certain things is
[2:26:59] because his inward fear of God was the
[2:27:03] thing that governed his outward
[2:27:04] behavior. Amen.
[2:27:08] I had a man that had enough gall and
[2:27:12] didn't have much brains, but he had
[2:27:13] nerve to say to me, "Brother Bam had a
[2:27:17] Christmas tree, and I wouldn't put that
[2:27:19] ungodly thing in my house." I said, "So,
[2:27:20] you think Brother Bram didn't have the
[2:27:22] Holy Ghost?
[2:27:24] You think Brother wasn't born again?"
[2:27:28] Woo! Praise the Lord. See, half of you
[2:27:30] want to say amen, but you're scared of
[2:27:31] what the other half's going to say if
[2:27:33] you do.
[2:27:34] Woo! Preach, Brother Ben.
[2:27:37] I know, but this is why I'm preaching
[2:27:39] this already. You can see by your own
[2:27:41] reactions how divided we are about
[2:27:44] things we should not be divided about.
[2:27:48] We're divided because the devil and the
[2:27:51] lack of preaching on these things has
[2:27:52] done more to harm to us than good. But
[2:27:54] that that we're divided because we have
[2:27:56] no clear understanding of what holiness
[2:27:59] really is. Amen.
[2:28:02] I knew a church in Ohio. The man that
[2:28:04] used to do it is dead. He used to have
[2:28:06] his deacons meet the girls at the door
[2:28:08] with a ruler and a measuring tape.
[2:28:12] And if they didn't meet a certain length
[2:28:14] of their garment, they were sent home
[2:28:17] and told to quit dressing like a
[2:28:19] coming to the house of God.
[2:28:23] Where y'all reckon those people are at
[2:28:25] today?
[2:28:26] backsley, gone, another church, atheist,
[2:28:29] you name it. Why? Because holiness was
[2:28:32] presented like the Israelites used to
[2:28:34] present it. The washing of pots and
[2:28:36] pans, the keeping of feast days and new
[2:28:38] moons and
[2:28:42] it was never God's intention to bury the
[2:28:45] people under a bunch of law.
[2:28:48] Man is the one that wanted law,
[2:28:52] not God.
[2:28:54] And if you think differently, you need
[2:28:55] to go back and read your Bible
[2:28:58] because God never intended. Grace
[2:29:00] provided a pillar of fire. Grace
[2:29:01] provided water. Grace provided mana.
[2:29:03] Grace provided the quail. Grace provided
[2:29:05] everything. And there these goofy people
[2:29:07] are standing at the bottom of the
[2:29:08] mountain. We want a law. We want
[2:29:09] something we can do. So God gave it to
[2:29:11] him. Never did he intend, it was never
[2:29:14] his perfect will
[2:29:16] for people to live under such a tyranny.
[2:29:19] But because it come from God, it had to
[2:29:21] be perfect.
[2:29:23] God himself knowing there wasn't a human
[2:29:24] being on this planet or ever would be
[2:29:26] that could keep the law. That's why he
[2:29:29] sent Jesus Christ.
[2:29:31] Amen. That's why he sent the Lord.
[2:29:34] That's why he came himself to do the
[2:29:36] job. Cuz no one could live under that.
[2:29:43] Amen. Amen.
[2:29:47] But we quoted holiness unto the Lord.
[2:29:50] That's right. Thank you, Lord. Y'all
[2:29:51] won't say amen. that little baby will.
[2:29:54] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:29:56] [Applause]
[2:30:01] But we always quoted holiness unto the
[2:30:03] Lord. Let's find out what it is.
[2:30:08] It's not just a dress code,
[2:30:10] but according to 1 Timothy 2:9,
[2:30:13] it's a heart posture.
[2:30:17] This addio
[2:30:20] shamefacedness, this reverence in a
[2:30:22] person's heart makes them godaware
[2:30:25] rather than selfaware.
[2:30:28] Woo! I'm about to hit something. Hold
[2:30:30] on. Hold on. Hold on. The captain has
[2:30:32] turned the seat belt light on.
[2:30:36] But when we are self-aware, you
[2:30:38] understand? When we put more emphasis on
[2:30:41] what's going on in our lives, we're
[2:30:43] being selfish.
[2:30:47] You can see people in their most earnest
[2:30:49] desire, oh pray for me about this and
[2:30:51] pray for me about that, pray for me
[2:30:53] about this and pray and everything in
[2:30:54] their life becomes consumed with what
[2:30:57] they want you to pray for them about.
[2:31:00] Or they're battling something. Take a
[2:31:02] man, woman going through divorce, that's
[2:31:03] all they can talk about. That's Do you
[2:31:04] realize no matter how hurt they are,
[2:31:06] that's selfish behavior.
[2:31:13] I don't care what the circumstance is. I
[2:31:17] don't care how bad it is. Ain't none of
[2:31:20] us got to the spot Job did.
[2:31:25] I am going to ask you for your amens
[2:31:26] now. Ain't none of us got that deep. And
[2:31:30] yet he was able to say, "The Lord giveth
[2:31:32] and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the
[2:31:35] name of the Lord." Amen.
[2:31:40] No matter how bad your problem is, when
[2:31:42] you put all your emphasis on it, all the
[2:31:45] emphasis you put here, you're taking it
[2:31:47] away from there.
[2:31:50] Which is why when we start going through
[2:31:52] some things, why don't we just start
[2:31:53] saying, you know, the Lord is able to do
[2:31:56] exceedingly abundantly above all we
[2:31:57] could ask or think. whatsoever things
[2:32:00] are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
[2:32:02] whatsoever things are a good report,
[2:32:04] whatsoever things are holy, whatsoever
[2:32:06] things are righteous, whatsoever things
[2:32:08] have virtue, that's where we get the
[2:32:10] English word dunamis, dynamite,
[2:32:14] whatsoever things are powerful,
[2:32:17] thank
[2:32:19] on these things.
[2:32:22] Amen.
[2:32:27] I'm persuaded to be believe if you'd
[2:32:29] walked around all the time, this cancer,
[2:32:30] this cancer, this cancer, this cancer,
[2:32:32] this cancer. But you know, the few times
[2:32:33] I interacted with you before the Lord
[2:32:35] touched you right before you went for
[2:32:36] your surgery. Matter of fact, we were
[2:32:37] sitting right down here at this little
[2:32:38] shop and you was testifying and it was
[2:32:40] all and I loved what Sister Donna was a
[2:32:42] blessing to me. She didn't even know she
[2:32:43] was blessing me. I've been battling this
[2:32:45] diabetes in my body and I got all kinds
[2:32:47] of things that goes along with it and I
[2:32:48] grumble all the time this sugar and that
[2:32:50] diabetes and I it's comes out of my
[2:32:52] mouth more than I'd like it to. But I
[2:32:53] heard her say 4,000 times, but you know,
[2:32:55] the Lord is good. God is a healer. You
[2:32:58] know, if there ever was anybody to take
[2:33:00] a lesson from on how it's done, it's
[2:33:02] that godly little woman sitting back
[2:33:04] there. Cuz we need to stop breving
[2:33:06] praise to ourself and the devil and
[2:33:10] start giving praise to almighty God and
[2:33:13] say he is able to do above and
[2:33:17] exceedingly abundantly more than we
[2:33:20] could ever ask or think.
[2:33:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:33:30] Stop being selfish.
[2:33:35] This little inward governor inside our
[2:33:37] heart puts our attention on Christ.
[2:33:41] Lord, I'm not important. Thy will be
[2:33:43] done as it is in heaven and earth. Look
[2:33:47] at your prophet laying mangled up with
[2:33:50] his leg and arm wrapped around a
[2:33:52] steering wheel. And Billy said, "Daddy,
[2:33:55] speak the word. You'll come out of it."
[2:33:58] And with brother Brandham's weak little
[2:34:00] old mouth, he could barely talk. put my
[2:34:03] hand on mommy.
[2:34:05] Billy moved his hand. Lord, don't let
[2:34:06] mommy die.
[2:34:08] Why?
[2:34:10] Because this was a prophet that
[2:34:11] understood God first
[2:34:15] and that the gift wasn't for him.
[2:34:18] And laying there tangled up in a car
[2:34:21] wreck, the Holy Ghost would not permit
[2:34:23] him to speak the word to come out of it
[2:34:25] because it was his time to go home. And
[2:34:28] in death, brother Brandham said, "Lord,
[2:34:30] whatever you want, that's what I want."
[2:34:35] Look at Paul when he came down to the
[2:34:37] end, not thinking of himself. Looked
[2:34:40] right at Nero's chop said, "Grave,
[2:34:41] where's your victory? And death, where's
[2:34:43] your sting?" Still thinking of the Lord.
[2:34:47] Putting his attention on Christ and what
[2:34:49] he had done for us.
[2:34:53] We serve God as Paul said in Hebrews
[2:34:56] acceptably.
[2:34:58] You see this inward fear teaches us how
[2:35:02] to worship
[2:35:04] not with arrogance
[2:35:07] but with gratitude and trembling.
[2:35:11] This addios in our heart isn't a
[2:35:13] weakness
[2:35:14] but it's heavenly dignity.
[2:35:18] People look at that as a shame. Oh, you
[2:35:21] fear God and you're afraid and oh, you
[2:35:23] know, and you don't want to do that. And
[2:35:24] I don't know how many of y'all had a
[2:35:26] daddy or a mama that would whip you when
[2:35:27] you done wrong and did it true. But some
[2:35:30] of y'all know
[2:35:32] somebody say, "Hey, let's go over and
[2:35:33] smoke a cigarette." Are you kidding me?
[2:35:35] My daddy will kill me.
[2:35:40] There was a fear there. And that's the
[2:35:42] human part of it. How much more would it
[2:35:44] be with God that when we go to look at
[2:35:47] something or listen to something or
[2:35:49] particip Oh my come on somebody help me
[2:35:51] preach.
[2:35:54] Somebody somebody help me.
[2:35:57] If we had that kind of fear in our
[2:35:59] heart, how much more will we reverence
[2:36:02] and respect God not to do the thing that
[2:36:05] we get caught doing over and over again?
[2:36:11] I need help with this. You need help
[2:36:13] with this. Let's not kid oursel. We're
[2:36:15] all fellas in the same ship. But what
[2:36:18] I'm preaching to you is possible.
[2:36:21] It is possible. It is tangible. We can
[2:36:23] lay our hands on it. We can accomplish
[2:36:25] having this in our heart if we are born
[2:36:27] again of the Holy Ghost. Amen. We have
[2:36:30] the ability, glory,
[2:36:34] to bring oursel in total subjection to
[2:36:37] the word. What the brother quote just
[2:36:38] before? The true omnipotence to God is
[2:36:41] being fully surrendered to God.
[2:36:45] And how can we fully surrender if we
[2:36:47] don't have full fe full fear and
[2:36:49] reverence for God?
[2:36:55] This is like a spiritual blush.
[2:36:59] You see girls that have that kind of,
[2:37:01] you know, they're
[2:37:03] they kind of blush a little bit.
[2:37:05] That's what this does for us
[2:37:08] when it comes to somebody, you know,
[2:37:11] trying to put us up on a pedestal or
[2:37:13] pump our egos up or something like that.
[2:37:15] There's there's a certain attribute of
[2:37:17] ourselves
[2:37:19] to where we kind of if any honor is
[2:37:20] given to us over Jesus, we kind of oh
[2:37:22] now brother,
[2:37:25] it doesn't make you arrogant
[2:37:28] and it doesn't allow you to become
[2:37:30] careless
[2:37:32] or reckless.
[2:37:34] Huh?
[2:37:36] It is a sense of shame, modesty,
[2:37:41] bashfulness,
[2:37:43] and respect, reverence, downcast eyes in
[2:37:46] holy fear. Like the angels in the
[2:37:48] temple, they had three sets of wings and
[2:37:50] one set of those wings was in reverence
[2:37:53] before God. Brother said, "That's what
[2:37:55] makes the complete servant." They have
[2:37:57] action. They have fear. They have all
[2:37:59] these things. But fear was one of the
[2:38:01] things that was included in what made
[2:38:03] you the right kind of son and daughter.
[2:38:08] This word
[2:38:11] adios
[2:38:13] in ancient in ancient Greek culture
[2:38:15] where this word comes from
[2:38:18] the word meant to restrain the reckless,
[2:38:21] to silence the proud, and protect honor.
[2:38:26] Oh my. And in the Christian life, it
[2:38:29] does that very thing. It restrains our
[2:38:32] reckless behavior. You realize many
[2:38:35] people that do things wrong. You take
[2:38:37] somebody that has an affair or they go
[2:38:39] get drunk or they they, you know, they
[2:38:41] they they get mad and cuss somebody or
[2:38:43] they tell us some kind of a lie or
[2:38:44] something like that. We we're so quick
[2:38:46] to throw people in hell for every little
[2:38:48] thing they do. But many times people
[2:38:51] make mistakes. It happens one time in a
[2:38:53] 40-year period.
[2:38:56] And if they're truly sensitive to the
[2:38:57] Lord at all, they repent, they make it
[2:38:58] right, they get their heart right, they
[2:39:00] move on, it never happens again.
[2:39:02] Why? Because the Holy Ghost restrains us
[2:39:06] from reckless behavior.
[2:39:09] How many of you sitting in here that
[2:39:10] would be loose in your life when it
[2:39:12] would come to relationships and and and
[2:39:14] women and men and things like that? Many
[2:39:16] of you, if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost,
[2:39:17] you'd be running with everything that
[2:39:19] had two legs.
[2:39:21] Hello. Preach, Brother Ben. Amen. Sure
[2:39:25] you would if the Holy Ghost didn't hold
[2:39:26] you back. Some of you all that was used
[2:39:29] to be drinkers and love to drink. My
[2:39:30] daddy when he was a sinner, he said, "I
[2:39:32] love to drink better than anything I can
[2:39:33] think of."
[2:39:35] What stopped him from all that drinking
[2:39:37] then for 50 years? He got something
[2:39:40] inside of here that restrained that
[2:39:43] reckless part of himself.
[2:39:50] Well, thank you for finally being honest
[2:39:51] about something
[2:39:56] cuz I know we don't like to see oursel
[2:39:58] in this kind of light, but if it wasn't
[2:40:00] for the Holy Ghost, whatever we would
[2:40:02] do, we'd do it. That's right. Don't you
[2:40:06] look at me that way. You know what I'm
[2:40:08] telling you is the truth. Amen. If it
[2:40:10] wasn't for the Holy Ghost, you would be
[2:40:13] more, way bigger, higher, greater than
[2:40:15] any of these people out in the world.
[2:40:17] You'd do it 10 times.
[2:40:20] Oh my God. The angels of the Lord have
[2:40:22] slipped into the building. Look at all
[2:40:24] them halos shining back at me. Oh,
[2:40:28] the bright light.
[2:40:32] You don't like to admit that part of
[2:40:33] yourself because you know that's a part
[2:40:35] of you. But without the Holy Ghost, it
[2:40:38] would still be you.
[2:40:44] But Addios restrains us.
[2:40:50] Amen.
[2:40:52] 1 Timothy 2:9. In light manner also, let
[2:40:56] let me let me find a place to quit.
[2:41:00] In light manner also that women adorn
[2:41:03] themsel in modest apparel with adios,
[2:41:08] shamefacedness, and
[2:41:11] sobriety.
[2:41:13] Now notice
[2:41:16] this blush of the soul.
[2:41:19] A woman is to conduct herself in
[2:41:21] shamefacedness. Now again, let's talk
[2:41:24] about holiness for a minute. Why don't a
[2:41:27] girl wear a dress above her knees? Why?
[2:41:29] The Bible said men, why don't you wear a
[2:41:31] little shorty shorts? Because the Bible
[2:41:33] said from here to here is the nakedness
[2:41:36] of a person.
[2:41:38] And you are to conceal your shape, your
[2:41:40] form, your figure, sister. You can't go
[2:41:43] out there and throw it out before every
[2:41:44] man. Because if you present yourself in
[2:41:46] a way and a man lusts after you, Jesus
[2:41:48] said you and him will meet it at
[2:41:51] judgment as committing adultery.
[2:41:55] People say, "Well, you can wear slacks
[2:41:57] and things like that that are godly.
[2:41:59] They sell women slacks."
[2:42:03] If I had time, I'd take you down through
[2:42:05] the history of how that came about in
[2:42:06] the first place. And you could tell from
[2:42:08] the from the way that it even showed up
[2:42:10] in America how ungodly it was in the
[2:42:13] very beginning and how fashion designers
[2:42:15] saw a place to make money.
[2:42:18] And so they pushed that on the women
[2:42:20] because they saw a marketing
[2:42:22] opportunity.
[2:42:24] It certainly wasn't because they were
[2:42:26] reading the Bible and went, "Well, look
[2:42:28] at here. We can make godly women slacks.
[2:42:31] They weren't looking at a Bible. They
[2:42:33] was looking at a ledger.
[2:42:38] Walks like a duck, talks like a duck.
[2:42:40] Anybody?
[2:42:46] Why don't we cut our hair, women?
[2:42:48] Because Paul said not to.
[2:42:51] Because it gives you power on your head.
[2:42:54] That's your prayer line. When you cut
[2:42:56] it, you cut it off to God. The only way
[2:42:58] he'll hear you is if you're repentant.
[2:43:00] Oh, I just trim it. I knew girls years
[2:43:02] ago used to take curling irons and burn
[2:43:04] it off to get it straight. We had one
[2:43:07] girl in the church many years ago and
[2:43:08] she'd say, "Rip it, rip it, rip it like
[2:43:10] this until you rip it straight."
[2:43:13] Is such an attitude one that reflects
[2:43:15] godly fear that a woman is treating her
[2:43:19] hair as the glory and her crown.
[2:43:23] It does not.
[2:43:26] What it shows is people trying to make
[2:43:28] excuses to be worldly and still trying
[2:43:31] to go to heaven.
[2:43:33] And guess what? You ain't going with
[2:43:35] that attitude knowhow,
[2:43:39] right?
[2:43:42] Why don't why don't men run around with
[2:43:44] gold necklaces on and all this kind of
[2:43:46] stuff like that?
[2:43:48] Where does that stuff come from? Go back
[2:43:49] look it up. Go back look at the
[2:43:51] origination of where a lot of that stuff
[2:43:53] come from. Heathenism.
[2:43:55] That's right.
[2:43:57] Why doesn't a woman wear a paint on her
[2:43:59] face? War with God. That's why
[2:44:04] there's only one woman in the Bible that
[2:44:05] ever painted her face and God fed her to
[2:44:07] the dogs.
[2:44:14] But why do we do it? Why do we live this
[2:44:16] way?
[2:44:18] It's our way of showing God respect.
[2:44:24] Lord Jesus, that doesn't mean, sister,
[2:44:26] if you've got a pimple on your face and
[2:44:27] you take a little bit of cover up and
[2:44:29] try to put it on that spot because
[2:44:30] you're embarrassed about it. You think
[2:44:33] somebody's going to send you to hell? If
[2:44:34] they if they do, they absolutely don't
[2:44:36] know their Bible and they're too
[2:44:37] legalistic for their own good.
[2:44:42] Brother Brandham, can a woman wear pain
[2:44:44] or cover up? He said, if you're so pale,
[2:44:47] go back and read it.
[2:44:50] Well, some of y'all quit saying amen.
[2:44:51] Wonder how that works. Amen. Some of
[2:44:53] y'all just quit saying amen alltogether.
[2:44:54] You doing good till I said that.
[2:44:58] My point is these things, these
[2:45:01] behaviors we preach about, they're only
[2:45:04] there because we're showing respect to
[2:45:06] God.
[2:45:10] A girl that paints her face up with a
[2:45:11] lot of great paints like that, it is
[2:45:14] designed to bring sexual appeal. Period.
[2:45:19] And if you ever watch any of these some
[2:45:21] of these videos where the girl does a
[2:45:22] before and an after and then she's
[2:45:24] putting on all the makeup, you can see
[2:45:25] these things in these reels and every
[2:45:27] great now and then you know something
[2:45:28] will pop up on my feed and this girl
[2:45:30] should be ugly as a m I shouldn't even
[2:45:32] say that. God help me. Forgive me, Lord.
[2:45:35] Brother Tom, Brother Brad, I'm sorry.
[2:45:37] Forgive me. Forgive me. Brother Ben done
[2:45:39] stuck his foot in his mouth again. But
[2:45:42] she's the most unfortunate little sister
[2:45:43] you've ever laid your eyes on.
[2:45:50] The poor little thing looked like she'd
[2:45:52] been beat with an ugly stick 10
[2:45:53] different times.
[2:45:56] Eyes crossed and brow goes straight
[2:45:58] across and big old puffy cheeks and big
[2:46:00] ugly eyes and she'll start doing this
[2:46:02] makeup stuff
[2:46:05] and then they do that little flash on
[2:46:06] the screen
[2:46:08] and the girl you're looking at ain't
[2:46:10] nothing like the one you saw before
[2:46:12] then.
[2:46:14] All you got to do is be spiritual enough
[2:46:16] to look at it and say that's why they do
[2:46:19] it.
[2:46:22] Can I quote you something? Can I?
[2:46:25] Brother Brandham said, "You don't paint
[2:46:26] your face to meet God. You do it to meet
[2:46:29] men.
[2:46:32] It's about self attention,
[2:46:36] bringing attention to self." Well, I
[2:46:38] know, I know, I know. Here comes the
[2:46:40] argument. Here come. Yeah, but what
[2:46:41] about them flashy clothes you wear,
[2:46:43] Brother Ben?
[2:46:47] You see, this is why this needs to be
[2:46:49] preached because then we start drawing
[2:46:51] all these lines in the sand of what's
[2:46:52] holy and what's not holy. And that is
[2:46:56] where you need to say, God, if I
[2:46:59] thought, Paul said it this way, if
[2:47:02] eating meat would offend my weaker
[2:47:04] brother,
[2:47:06] I'd never do it again. Can you find me
[2:47:08] in scripture where eating meat in the
[2:47:09] New Testament was wrong? You can go to
[2:47:12] the Old Testament and find you can't eat
[2:47:13] pig. And it would take a whole lot of
[2:47:15] Holy Ghost not to eat pig.
[2:47:19] I am glad. Aren't you, brethren? I got
[2:47:23] some preachers backing me up here. Now,
[2:47:24] I'm telling you, I'm glad Paul got that
[2:47:26] changed over for us in this New
[2:47:27] Testament. It would take a lot of Holy
[2:47:30] Ghost, a bucketload of Holy Ghost to not
[2:47:32] be able to eat pig and bacon and those
[2:47:34] things like that. Oh god, I can taste it
[2:47:35] now.
[2:47:45] But this is the reason why Paul would
[2:47:46] say, "If it would offend my brother, I'd
[2:47:48] never do it again.
[2:47:51] All things are lawful,
[2:47:54] but some things are not expedient.
[2:47:57] Some things are expedient, some things
[2:47:59] are not lawful, and vice versa."
[2:48:02] There were debates and battles.
[2:48:06] When Moses wrote the Ten Commandments,
[2:48:08] God by his finger writes it. He takes it
[2:48:09] down and gives it to the people. Thou
[2:48:11] shalt not kill. And God turns around and
[2:48:14] tells his predecessor Joshua, go to Ai
[2:48:17] and kill everything.
[2:48:23] Now, let's get the quotes and throw them
[2:48:24] at the people of the message. the
[2:48:26] prophet said. But here's God telling him
[2:48:30] something different than what God wrote
[2:48:31] in the law. So later on, a man standing
[2:48:35] out in the field. He's chopping wood.
[2:48:36] The axe handle flies off the uh the axe
[2:48:39] flies off the axe handle and
[2:48:40] accidentally kills his brother.
[2:48:43] According to the law, he's to be stoned
[2:48:44] without mercy under two and three
[2:48:46] witnesses. So what did they do? They
[2:48:48] created cities of refuge.
[2:48:51] That a person, that's why Abner died
[2:48:53] like a fool because he was in the city
[2:48:54] of refuge. If it had stayed put, nobody
[2:48:57] could have touched him. But they enticed
[2:48:59] him to come outside the city of refuge.
[2:49:01] And when they did, they got him.
[2:49:04] Why was there a city of refuge in the
[2:49:06] first place? Isn't the law good enough?
[2:49:08] Isn't the ten commandments cut and dried
[2:49:10] enough?
[2:49:13] Ten Commandments and what is it? 683
[2:49:16] amendments.
[2:49:18] You know why? because it goes to prove
[2:49:21] holiness
[2:49:23] is not about having every little thing
[2:49:25] to the dot.
[2:49:29] But it's about having this kind of fear.
[2:49:32] Lord,
[2:49:34] if wearing this certain shirt offended
[2:49:36] my brothers and sisters, I'll burn it
[2:49:37] tonight.
[2:49:45] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:49:47] Reverence is not restriction
[2:49:51] but liberation
[2:49:55] arrogance
[2:49:57] blinds people to that.
[2:50:00] When people become arrogant and proud
[2:50:02] and self enthused and self whatever
[2:50:08] they become blind
[2:50:10] to what reverencing God really looks
[2:50:12] like.
[2:50:14] I mean, I I've told you this thousand
[2:50:16] times. I'm gonna say it again. I I was
[2:50:17] at a place preaching one time, and this
[2:50:19] brother, he he actually believed that if
[2:50:21] a woman wear wore red, that she was an
[2:50:23] adulteress.
[2:50:26] And I'm telling you what's the truth.
[2:50:27] This man believed this. He's a good
[2:50:30] friend of mine, close friend of mine.
[2:50:31] Some of his people came in, was talking
[2:50:32] to me, and they just kept pinning me
[2:50:33] down year after year after year. What do
[2:50:34] you think about it? What do you think
[2:50:35] about it? Finally, I just said, "My
[2:50:37] brother is my friend and I love him, but
[2:50:40] it looks to me like on this issue, he
[2:50:41] needs to get out of the Scarlet Letter
[2:50:43] and get into the Bible."
[2:50:46] Because he'd read the Scarlet Letter,
[2:50:48] and that's where he got the idea. That
[2:50:50] red was prostitution. Well, if that had
[2:50:52] been the case, then when that little
[2:50:54] sister took her little red cord and put
[2:50:56] it out there as a sign of the token,
[2:50:59] Rahab would have been in trouble
[2:51:02] because she was a prostitute.
[2:51:05] But red had nothing to do with it.
[2:51:10] Huh?
[2:51:11] Oh, praise the Lord. Y'all say, "Well,
[2:51:13] that's easy, brother V. That's easy."
[2:51:14] Let's talk about Christmas again.
[2:51:18] [Laughter]
[2:51:22] Let's close.
[2:51:25] Without this inner thing, Addios,
[2:51:28] worship becomes entertainment.
[2:51:31] Preaching becomes performance.
[2:51:34] That don't mean you can't have a good
[2:51:35] time. I have a good time every time I
[2:51:37] preach.
[2:51:39] Well,
[2:51:40] in certain churches,
[2:51:44] sometimes they won't let you.
[2:51:47] I'm a bit of a cutup and sometimes I use
[2:51:49] humor and things in my preaching. And
[2:51:51] and I went to one church and oh my god,
[2:51:53] when I started being me a little bit, I
[2:51:54] thought them poor people, they I saw
[2:51:56] literally could see them taking heart
[2:51:58] pills and stuff like that. I mean, it
[2:51:59] was tearing them all to pieces.
[2:52:04] But see, you can do things in a manner
[2:52:06] and still reverence God.
[2:52:09] You don't have to walk around all the
[2:52:10] time, yay, yay, and nigh, nay, packing a
[2:52:13] Bible under your arm.
[2:52:15] Thou shalt go to Mexican with me, saith
[2:52:19] the Lord.
[2:52:25] But it's about having that inner
[2:52:27] something
[2:52:29] that tells you, who that's enough.
[2:52:33] It's enough.
[2:52:35] That little governor on the inside
[2:52:38] that tells you what to do and what not
[2:52:39] to do.
[2:52:41] See, for some things, for certain
[2:52:43] things, for some people it's fine. But
[2:52:46] for other people, if they tried that, I
[2:52:47] knew a brother that used to be a
[2:52:49] horrible alcoholic and he got saved, got
[2:52:51] converted. One day after church, the
[2:52:53] preacher wanted to take us out to eat.
[2:52:54] The only thing that was open was an
[2:52:55] Applebee's restaurant. And the brother
[2:52:58] would not go in because at a bar in the
[2:53:00] middle of the of the restaurant and and
[2:53:02] he told us and I respected him for it.
[2:53:04] He said, "Brothers, listen, it's not
[2:53:06] that I don't want to fellowship. It's
[2:53:07] not that I don't love you all. It's not
[2:53:08] that I think you're doing wrong, but I
[2:53:10] cannot go around that. I promise God I'd
[2:53:12] stay away from it all my days and I'm
[2:53:13] not going around that." He went down and
[2:53:16] I think I think Taco Bell was open. He
[2:53:18] got him a sack of tacos and went home.
[2:53:21] But I respected him for that,
[2:53:24] especially because he said, "It's not
[2:53:26] that I think you guys are doing wrong,
[2:53:28] but this is the way I've chose to serve
[2:53:30] the Lord." What's wrong with that?
[2:53:34] Why would I condemn him and throw him in
[2:53:36] hell and say, "What's the matter with
[2:53:37] you?" And you got no victory.
[2:53:40] I let him sweep his steps and I'll sweep
[2:53:43] mine.
[2:53:47] Let's stand. Let's stand.
[2:53:49] Y'all ain't going to quit pulling and
[2:53:50] I'm going to keep preaching. So, I'm
[2:53:51] going have to figure out a way to cut
[2:53:53] this off.
[2:53:56] You folks are glutton for punishment.
[2:53:57] You know that, don't you? You've just
[2:53:59] about preached me to death.
[2:54:02] It's your fault. Don't you look at me.
[2:54:04] It's your fault. You're the pullers.
[2:54:07] See, this is not just about modesty and
[2:54:09] clothing, but modesty of spirit.
[2:54:15] Reverence to God
[2:54:18] turns the volume of what we do
[2:54:23] into value.
[2:54:25] The volume of it, how much we do. Real
[2:54:29] reverence with God turns that great
[2:54:31] volume into value. Things of value come
[2:54:36] of a great price.
[2:54:41] And in the house of God,
[2:54:44] it transforms church pews,
[2:54:48] chairs,
[2:54:51] tree logs under a tree. Like I've
[2:54:53] preached in other countries like that.
[2:54:56] It turns those places into holy ground.
[2:55:00] Jesus said, "Where two and three are
[2:55:02] gathered." Did you notice he didn't say
[2:55:03] where?
[2:55:05] He just said, "If you're gathered in my
[2:55:07] name, I'll be right there in the midst
[2:55:09] of you."
[2:55:11] That's what fear does. It brings God on
[2:55:13] the scene anywhere we go.
[2:55:17] In a message,
[2:55:21] Jeremiah's message to Israel, chapter 6,
[2:55:24] were they ashamed? Verse 15, were they
[2:55:26] ashamed when they had committed
[2:55:27] abomination? Nay, they were not ashamed
[2:55:30] at all. Neither could they blush.
[2:55:38] And when we lose this spirit of adios,
[2:55:42] that's when Kabad is wrote over the door
[2:55:45] of our churches, our homes, and our
[2:55:48] lives.
[2:55:50] We lose that fear for God. Look at this
[2:55:52] nation. This nation in 1956 heard more
[2:55:55] preaching and had more ministers. And
[2:55:57] brother R said, they were going back and
[2:55:58] forth across. He said, "I predict this
[2:56:00] will be the year that they turn it
[2:56:01] down." By 1957, America had completely
[2:56:04] turned down the the gospel alto
[2:56:06] together. And guess who they crowned as
[2:56:08] their king in 1956? Elvis Presley.
[2:56:13] That was when he was crowned the king of
[2:56:14] rock and roll, America's king. Why?
[2:56:18] Brother told us why. Because the
[2:56:21] churches wouldn't quit backbiting and
[2:56:23] fussing and grumbling and lying on one
[2:56:24] another and splitting and dividing and
[2:56:27] having dysfellowship over every little
[2:56:29] thing that moves.
[2:56:31] I mean, what difference does it make if
[2:56:33] Brother Brad believes he's come back on
[2:56:35] a cloud, you believe he's come back on a
[2:56:36] horse, and I believe that he's coming
[2:56:37] back just as himself, what what what
[2:56:40] does it matter?
[2:56:42] As long as our motives and our
[2:56:43] objectives and everything we're doing
[2:56:45] are running in the same direction,
[2:56:47] why can't we let those little things
[2:56:49] just fall to the side and run together
[2:56:51] as brothers and sisters? You know why?
[2:56:55] Because we've lost that reverential fear
[2:56:57] for God and for one another. And when we
[2:57:00] lose it for God, we start losing it for
[2:57:02] one another. Lose it for one another, we
[2:57:03] start losing it for God. It's a
[2:57:04] hand-in-and deal.
[2:57:07] And when we do that, look at what
[2:57:08] happens in the church. People become
[2:57:10] critical. So everything that's not done
[2:57:12] to their liking, they're critical of
[2:57:14] everything. Why did I do that for? Why
[2:57:15] did I do that for? If I'm in the house
[2:57:18] of God and I know his presence is here,
[2:57:20] I'm not interested. If you're wearing
[2:57:22] red, blue, purple, green, polka-dotted,
[2:57:24] a potato sack
[2:57:28] or a straw hat, it don't matter to me
[2:57:30] what you got on you. And it doesn't
[2:57:32] matter to me in any way what a person is
[2:57:35] doing. When God is here, that's all I
[2:57:37] care about.
[2:57:39] Look at brother Brown. When he'd be in
[2:57:40] Africa and India and those places, those
[2:57:42] natives would come in there and those
[2:57:44] women bare breasted and things like
[2:57:45] that. So they'd be standing there in a
[2:57:47] meeting, brother Brown preaching. He
[2:57:48] didn't reach out there and holler,
[2:57:49] "Hey," he didn't go get his coat and
[2:57:52] say, "You brethren, cover these women
[2:57:54] up." Like he told the story about that
[2:57:55] girl in the tabernacle. You know why he
[2:57:57] done it to the girl in the tabernacle?
[2:57:59] Because she was disrespectful and would
[2:58:01] not behave herself in the house of God.
[2:58:04] And so, Brother Bram went and dealt with
[2:58:06] her,
[2:58:07] but he'd be preaching. And he said,
[2:58:09] "Those bare breasted women would cover
[2:58:11] theirelves up like that and start
[2:58:12] walking back." Why? Brother said, "Who
[2:58:15] told them they were naked? I never told
[2:58:17] them,
[2:58:19] but it was the fact they had enough fear
[2:58:21] when God showed up.
[2:58:23] Just like Adam and Eve, they hid
[2:58:26] themselves in the bushes.
[2:58:31] [Music]
[2:58:32] Let's take one extra thing. We'll quit.
[2:58:36] When God is talking to Cain in the book
[2:58:37] of Genesis, you ever look at those two
[2:58:39] chapters he talks to him in chapter
[2:58:41] four, he says, "Do like your brother.
[2:58:43] You'll be accepted. Don't
[2:58:46] He said, "Then sin lays at your door."
[2:58:49] He went back and forth talking to him.
[2:58:52] You notice we don't get a conversation
[2:58:54] with him and Abel.
[2:58:56] I don't find in the scriptures where he
[2:58:58] talked to Seth.
[2:59:01] But here he is talking to Cain, Satan's
[2:59:04] boy.
[2:59:05] [Music]
[2:59:07] Cain goes out, go right to the next few
[2:59:10] chapters, and you find God talking to
[2:59:12] him all over again.
[2:59:14] and a mark will be put upon you and
[2:59:16] anybody that touches you, they'll answer
[2:59:18] to me.
[2:59:22] Can't you see
[2:59:24] the Lord tried and tried and tried and
[2:59:28] tried with that boy knowing he could not
[2:59:32] be saved.
[2:59:34] But God could have come down the very
[2:59:36] first moment that Cain took the breath
[2:59:37] of life and began to understand language
[2:59:39] and understand words. God could have
[2:59:42] come down and said, "You ain't nothing
[2:59:44] but a devil. You are nothing but the
[2:59:46] serpent seed. You'll never be any good."
[2:59:51] But that wasn't his attitude. Why?
[2:59:54] Because God had fear for humanity.
[2:59:59] Why? Because he's not willing that any
[3:00:02] should perish, but that all should come
[3:00:05] to everlasting life. Let me tell you
[3:00:07] something. That reverence and respect
[3:00:10] that God has for a human's ability to
[3:00:13] choose one day will cut off just as sure
[3:00:16] as we're standing here. As sure as two
[3:00:18] and two is for. And then the Bible said,
[3:00:20] "In the day of your calamity, you'll
[3:00:22] call and I'll laugh at you."
[3:00:26] Which is why
[3:00:28] we don't need just a dose of respect. We
[3:00:31] need a double dose of it. God, fill me
[3:00:34] with the fear and the reverence of the
[3:00:35] Lord. fill me with respect and fear that
[3:00:40] I could live in a way that I know you're
[3:00:42] watching and you're taking notice and
[3:00:43] you're paying attention to my behavior.
[3:00:47] But Tom, how do we ever expect to come
[3:00:49] to adoption if we don't have this in our
[3:00:52] heart? How could we come to adoption
[3:00:54] when adoption is based on our behavior?
[3:00:58] And if I don't fear him, I'm not going
[3:00:59] to act right. I'm not going to serve him
[3:01:02] right. But if I fear him right, then
[3:01:05] I'll serve him right. I may mess up a
[3:01:08] million times. I may make a gazillion
[3:01:10] more mistakes from the moment I preach
[3:01:12] this sermon. But if I have the right
[3:01:13] kind of fear for him, brother John, I'm
[3:01:15] just going to keep saying, "Lord,
[3:01:16] forgive me. Lord, forgive me. Lord,
[3:01:17] forgive me. Lord, forgive me. Lord,
[3:01:18] forgive me. Help me, God. Give me
[3:01:20] strength, God. Give me mercy, God. Give
[3:01:22] me strength, God." Don't never give up
[3:01:24] on that kind of attitude.
[3:01:27] Cuz if you ever stop asking, you'll stop
[3:01:30] asking altogether.
[3:01:34] Never stop asking for his mercy. Never
[3:01:37] get to the place where he's, oh, he's
[3:01:39] done fooling with me. You don't know
[3:01:40] that.
[3:01:43] If you've got breath, there's a chance
[3:01:45] you can be saved. If you got breath,
[3:01:47] there's a chance you can be healed. If
[3:01:49] you got breath, there's a chance you can
[3:01:50] be restored.
[3:01:53] But it's up to how you're going to fear
[3:01:54] him, how you're going to respect him.
[3:01:57] You see, people come to the altar and
[3:01:58] pray. And you know, as long as
[3:02:00] somebody's anointed and can pray
[3:02:01] anointed over them, they'll jump and
[3:02:03] shout and run. That jumping and shouting
[3:02:06] and running at an altar like that is
[3:02:08] wonderful. If it's for if it's
[3:02:10] understood you're doing the right thing.
[3:02:14] But if it's just a feeling, if some
[3:02:16] man's just making you feel that way, in
[3:02:20] a few days time, that'll be gone and
[3:02:22] you'll be left holding a bag.
[3:02:26] We approach prayer lines. We approach
[3:02:28] altar calls. We approach prayer for the
[3:02:30] sick. We approach prayer for the saint.
[3:02:32] We approach everything with one thing.
[3:02:34] Fear for God. Lord, this is your word.
[3:02:37] You told me if I ask, you would hear.
[3:02:40] And if it's your will, you will do it.
[3:02:43] Brother said, I heard an evangelist the
[3:02:45] other day demanding God. God, I demand
[3:02:47] you. He said, I thought God have mercy
[3:02:49] on the poor man. He just doesn't
[3:02:51] understand. We don't demand God
[3:02:53] anything.
[3:02:55] We say, "Father, thy will be done
[3:02:58] and not mine."
[3:03:01] With your heads bowed, God bless you.
[3:03:03] Thank you for your time.
[3:03:06] [Music]
[3:03:08] Father, we thank you so much for your
[3:03:12] word, for your grace.
[3:03:14] We're so grateful to you, Lord, for all
[3:03:16] that you do. Thank you for the strength
[3:03:20] you've given me to preach this, Lord.
[3:03:23] here. Lord, I've held the people long
[3:03:24] and said a lot of things, but Lord,
[3:03:29] this hour we're living in is so late, so
[3:03:31] serious.
[3:03:33] It's hard when I get under this
[3:03:34] anointing not to just cut it off and
[3:03:36] walk away. So hard not to. Just stand
[3:03:40] here and hold it and hold it and hold
[3:03:42] it. If I think I'm doing any little bit
[3:03:44] of good, I just push and push.
[3:03:48] I want them to get it so bad. Lord,
[3:03:51] please don't let a one of us walk out of
[3:03:53] here and miss this.
[3:03:55] Lord, this is the keynote of many things
[3:03:57] that we're going to do in life.
[3:03:59] [Music]
[3:04:03] Father, may your spirit fall fresh upon
[3:04:08] every person in here.
[3:04:10] And Lord, may you convict their heart
[3:04:12] and deal with their heart. May you bless
[3:04:15] their heart and whatever you want to do.
[3:04:19] May your spirit go to each one of them
[3:04:22] and grant them the desires of their
[3:04:24] heart. Now we pray
[3:04:26] in Jesus name. With your heads bowed for
[3:04:28] just another minute. Now I want to know
[3:04:31] somebody in here perhaps maybe not
[3:04:32] saved. Maybe you're backslid. You'd like
[3:04:35] to give your heart to the Lord. Would
[3:04:36] you raise your hand to the Lord?
[3:04:39] God bless you. Anybody else?
[3:04:43] Somebody not saved. Brother Ben, I want
[3:04:45] to give my heart to the Lord. Anybody at
[3:04:47] all?
[3:04:48] like to raise your hand to the Lord.
[3:04:52] Now, for the rest of you believers in
[3:04:54] here, perhaps you would say, "Brother
[3:04:56] Ben, I realize that I've allowed this
[3:04:58] area of my life to just go cold, go
[3:05:00] numb. I'm not nearly as fearful as I
[3:05:02] used to be. I'm not nearly as reverent
[3:05:04] as I used to be. And I need God's help
[3:05:07] to help me bring it back. Would you just
[3:05:08] raise your hand to the Lord?" God bless.
[3:05:11] Many hands going up now. Thank the Lord
[3:05:13] for that.
[3:05:15] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[3:05:20] Thank you for your honesty before the
[3:05:21] Lord. Let's pray one more time. Can we?
[3:05:25] And if you would, would you reach over
[3:05:26] and take the hand of somebody stand
[3:05:28] there next to you? And let's pray one
[3:05:30] for another, can we?
[3:05:33] Let's just ask the Lord to be with all
[3:05:34] of us. There's many, many hands went up
[3:05:36] in this building this morning.
[3:05:38] Heavenly Father, as we come back before
[3:05:41] your throne today, we do so in the name
[3:05:44] of Jesus Christ.
[3:05:47] Lord, you see the lives of your people.
[3:05:50] You see where they're standing at, Lord.
[3:05:53] And Father, I done everything I could to
[3:05:55] not have to preach this sermon this
[3:05:56] morning because it seems to be so hard.
[3:05:59] But Lord, looking out there across this
[3:06:01] audience this morning, I can see it's so
[3:06:03] needed.
[3:06:05] The people have received it into their
[3:06:06] heart. That uplifted hand represented
[3:06:09] that place where the seed fell. Now may
[3:06:12] they take that little seed within
[3:06:14] theirel
[3:06:15] God. May they begin to water it with
[3:06:18] praise and feed it the word and feed it
[3:06:21] by the spirit. And may they Lord just
[3:06:23] keep it alive. May that little touch of
[3:06:26] the Holy Spirit that moved on them this
[3:06:28] morning to raise their hand up. I need
[3:06:31] to go back restore back to the place of
[3:06:34] such reverence like I used to be. God
[3:06:37] let it be so for each of them. I pray
[3:06:39] and as they got their hands laid one
[3:06:41] upon another Lord like one great big
[3:06:44] prayer line in here we pray the Holy
[3:06:46] Spirit will go from eagle to eagle
[3:06:48] contact to contact hand to hand life to
[3:06:50] life and may great things be done for
[3:06:53] the body of Christ and for the people of
[3:06:55] God may evil things go from the people's
[3:06:58] lives may evil spirits be cast away the
[3:07:01] blood of Jesus cleanse us from all sin
[3:07:03] and all unrighteousness may you heal up
[3:07:05] every wound Lord may you bind up every
[3:07:08] every place, Lord, that's been broken by
[3:07:10] sin and by besetting sins and little
[3:07:13] things that have easily beset the saint.
[3:07:15] May the power of God go in there and rub
[3:07:17] your bomb of Gilead in there. Bring
[3:07:20] back, restore back, I pray in the name
[3:07:22] of Jesus, this reverential fear that we
[3:07:25] need to serve you in greater ways. Grant
[3:07:28] it, Lord, for each of them. If there be
[3:07:30] any other need, Father, in this
[3:07:32] building, be it healing, sickness,
[3:07:33] deliverance, whatever it might be, may
[3:07:35] you grant that as well, Lord, as we pray
[3:07:37] and ask for these things. In the name of
[3:07:40] Jesus Christ, we pray.
[3:07:42] And all the saints said, "Amen."
[3:07:45] Now, raise your hands up like this and
[3:07:47] just start thanking the Lord for it.
[3:07:50] I I know I've held you a little long,
[3:07:52] but we got a little time to worship him,
[3:07:54] don't we?
[3:07:56] You're not in that big a hurry, are you?
[3:07:59] This is a good time just to say, "Lord,
[3:08:00] thank you for what you done for me
[3:08:02] today. Thank you for speaking to me.
[3:08:04] Thank you for correcting me. Thank you
[3:08:06] for pricking my heart. Thank you for
[3:08:08] dealing with the church, dealing with
[3:08:10] the people. Thank you for dealing with
[3:08:12] my family." Whatever it is that you've
[3:08:14] got in your heart. Now's a good time
[3:08:16] just to thank him. Say, "Lord, thank
[3:08:17] you. Thank you, Father. Thank you,
[3:08:20] Jesus.
[3:08:22] Lord, how we love you. How we thank you.
[3:08:25] We bless your holy name. We bless your
[3:08:27] holy name.

[3:12:31] Amen. And how many believes it has to
[3:12:33] come from the heart? Amen. That
[3:12:35] oldfashioned heartfelt religion. Amen.
[3:12:39] Brother Mooney, how are you doing? Did
[3:12:41] you want prayer? Are you okay? Or you
[3:12:43] want prayer? All right, come on up and
[3:12:45] uh let's pray for our brother that the
[3:12:46] devil's really giving him a round of
[3:12:48] anxiety and things and we just want to
[3:12:51] uh pray that the Lord will just give him
[3:12:53] peace in his heart and deliver him from
[3:12:54] anxiety and he's really really wanting
[3:12:57] to completely turn his heart over to the
[3:13:00] Lord and make sure that everything's
[3:13:01] right. So, let's pray for him.
[3:13:06] Lord Jesus
[3:13:08] [Music]
[3:13:10] was over my brother's head.
[3:13:13] you said in your word and pray God for
[3:13:15] mercy Lord Jesus if they anoint them
[3:13:17] with oil and call for the elders of the
[3:13:19] church
[3:13:20] that the prayer of faith shall save this
[3:13:24] and Lord no one can say any contrary
[3:13:27] because one among us raised up from the
[3:13:30] dead
[3:13:33] if you can heal cancer
[3:13:35] you can curse this anxiety
[3:13:38] you can calm these nerves as you did the
[3:13:40] sea when every devil People swore that
[3:13:43] it would drown you before you met that
[3:13:45] little maniac of Geria.
[3:13:48] Lord, you said peace and the waves
[3:13:50] calmed. Now, Father, may your great
[3:13:53] spirit, may your great voice, may your
[3:13:55] great hand speak peace to these nerves.
[3:13:59] May the spirit of anxiety and dread,
[3:14:02] Lord, may it be cast away from him. We
[3:14:06] speak to that enemy in the name of Jesus
[3:14:08] Christ.
[3:14:10] Satan, thou who callest thyself anxiety,
[3:14:13] fear, demonic oppression,
[3:14:17] I sent you, you liar, and by the spirit
[3:14:20] of the living God and the righteous
[3:14:22] Christ who shed his blood at Calvary for
[3:14:25] our brother Mooney, we command this
[3:14:28] thing in the name of the Lord God to
[3:14:30] leave his body, leave his spirit, leave
[3:14:34] his mind, you tormentor, in the name of
[3:14:37] Jesus, I send you back to hell where you
[3:14:40] came from. You're a bluff and you're a
[3:14:43] liar and you're a loser. And I adjure
[3:14:45] you. I condemn you and I expose you in
[3:14:48] Jesus name. Leave my brother's body.
[3:14:51] Leave his mind. Leave his spirit. And
[3:14:54] Father, bring healing to these nerves.
[3:14:56] Lord, they're always affected by that
[3:14:58] anointing when it comes on a person's
[3:15:00] mind, their their body, their serotonin,
[3:15:02] every part of their body. Lord, every
[3:15:05] cortisol cell, every thing floods,
[3:15:08] right? Lord, he needs healing in that
[3:15:10] physical man. Bring healing to his mind.
[3:15:13] When the mind suffers anxiety,
[3:15:15] scientists say it's like the brains
[3:15:16] received even a punch from a boxer.
[3:15:19] Bring healing to my brother's mind and
[3:15:20] body. Now that this spirit has been a
[3:15:23] jured, now that it's gone from him,
[3:15:24] bring healing to his nerves, healing to
[3:15:26] his cells. May the chemicals of his body
[3:15:29] run positive. May all that cortisol
[3:15:32] settle down. Lord, bring sleep to him.
[3:15:34] Bring restorative sleep to him. May his
[3:15:36] mind and his brain heal. May every part
[3:15:39] of him, every wit in Jesus' name. Like
[3:15:42] Moses said, not a hoof left behind.
[3:15:44] We're believing for total deliverance.
[3:15:46] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. In
[3:15:49] Jesus' name, just receive it, my
[3:15:52] brother. I believe it's going to be all
[3:15:53] right.
[3:15:56] Hallelujah.
[3:15:57] [Music]
[3:15:58] Thank you, Lord. only
[3:16:01] believe.
[3:16:04] Lord, I receive. Lord,
[3:16:08] I receive.
[3:16:12] My Lord,
[3:16:14] I receive.
[3:16:17] [Music]
[3:16:18] All things are possible.
[3:16:24] Lord, I
[3:16:26] receive.
[3:16:29] Lord,
[3:16:31] I receive.
[3:16:34] Oh yes, Lord
[3:16:37] I receive.
[3:16:41] All things are possible.
[3:16:46] Lord, I
[3:16:48] receive.
[3:16:50] Amen. Let's close in prayer this
[3:16:52] morning. Our precious heavenly father,
[3:16:54] Lord, it has been good to be in the
[3:16:56] house of the Lord. Lord, to hear your
[3:16:59] spirit speak from heaven to our hearts
[3:17:01] and to each and every one of us, Lord,
[3:17:03] telling us just where you want us to be,
[3:17:05] Father, Lord, to live, Lord, from our
[3:17:08] heart, Lord Jesus, and to do all these
[3:17:10] things and to obey your commandments,
[3:17:13] Lord, and do those things that are
[3:17:14] pleasing to you, Lord, not out of
[3:17:17] command, or Lord Jesus, or natural way,
[3:17:20] but because it's in our heart to do it,
[3:17:22] Lord. And I pray God that this week
[3:17:24] would be a special week for each one
[3:17:26] that was here or those that are
[3:17:28] listening Lord. Father, that we'd have a
[3:17:30] closer walk with you, Lord Jesus. And
[3:17:33] Father, the things of that are evil, the
[3:17:35] things that are wrong, they'll look
[3:17:36] horrible to us, Lord, will shun the very
[3:17:39] appearance of it, Lord, because of the
[3:17:42] baptism of the Holy Spirit, because of
[3:17:44] your life that is in our hearts. Father,
[3:17:47] thank you, Lord, for deliverance today.
[3:17:49] Thank you for touching us in every
[3:17:51] aspect, Lord, that we needed touched in,
[3:17:53] Lord. Bless brother Ben, Lord. Give him
[3:17:55] strength again. Build him back, Lord.
[3:17:58] And bless the people for their patience,
[3:18:00] Lord Jesus, and for their open heart,
[3:18:02] for their open mind, Lord, and for their
[3:18:04] respect for you, Lord. And we ask this
[3:18:06] in Jesus' name. Amen and amen
[3:18:11] and amen.
[3:18:13] Amen. Let's take the name of Jesus with
[3:18:15] you as we go. You all are dismissed.
[3:18:18] Amen. As we sing that song, take the
[3:18:22] name of Jesus with
[3:18:25] you,
[3:18:27] child of sorrow and of wo
[3:18:33] and it will joy and comfort give
[3:18:39] you.
[3:18:40] Take it then.
