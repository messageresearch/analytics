our spirit amen it was very good amen it was very good and appreciate it amen you singing for the lord amen i think it is going around again pretty good uh some of that coveted stuff as we call it that covert stuff and so the symptoms like from what i understand is definitely something you want to pay attention to and so if you find yourself with that just hang out at the house for a couple days right we don't want to spread it if we possibly can help it amen i went to pay to a public place pay one of my bills and the lady behind the counter was talking about how that top sick she was just around christmas after i asked her how she was doing all right i had this here and i had fever and i had that in the other and i'm like that was just a couple days ago i don't know if i should be standing here or if you should be telling everybody you know but anyway i said well praise the lord anyway you know just tell you we're only uh i mean god takes care of us don't he amen so praise the lord amen but it's good to be in the house of the lord amen and so we're here amen we're gonna miss john michael amen so i guess you brought the u-haul you know take over take our son away from us here and stuff that that just kidding but anyway so we appreciate him and being here yet tonight i don't know don't guess you'll be here sunday but god bless you amen god be with you amen let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you father tonight thankful hearts to be able to assemble ourselves together and lord feeling good father we appreciate lord the health that you have given each one lord and father we do thank you for touching those that have had this covert this different sicknesses that's going around and we know brother david said he was fever broke last night so i believe he's feeling a little better and we thank you for that lord jesus and we just ask god that you'd be with each one that is not feeling well willy and natalie and them that you just be with him and and touch him give him a touch from the master lord may the great physician touch them lord and may they raise back up lord jesus and have a testimony for you that lord you are the one that heals all of our disease this isn't sick this is lord and we thank you father for being our healer and lord we ask god tonight that you'd be in the service lord those that are streaming we pray for the the system lord that it perhaps run a little better lord we could sure use less voids in it lord jesus we ask god that you'd help them to be able to hear everything that is said in both by their ears but all of our heart lord in this midweek service we've gathered together in your name believing that you'll have your way speak through us lord tonight and have your way in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen turn if you will to the book of hebrews hebrews 1. just had a little thought come to my heart uh and really but it does have to do with god expressing himself amen in his expressions amen it could be otherwise thought of as his attributes but i call it the expressions we want to call it his expressions this evening hebrews 1 verse 1 god who had sun dry times in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets has in these last days spoken unto us by by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory being who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sin sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen amen i called it expressions tonight but i want to call it god's expressions amen for one thing but we want to talk about different expressions amen but here we want to start with this word express amen i got to thinking about that word express expressing amen uh and i thought about you know all the different things uh many times perhaps somebody will get scared or something will be said that's real gross and somebody are like ooh you know they'll have facial expressions right we express ourselves a lot of times and you can kind of see what's being said or whatever by the expression that people have amen so tonight with the help of the lord we want to talk a little about this for the with the help of the lord um but you know so it says that christ was the expressed image of his person now that was expressing how many believe that there's a lot of things that's incomprehensible about god such as his uh uh his omniscience all knowing his power how he makes things now he does uh even his existence i never could have had a start a little bit mind blowing you know all these different things but there are things that we can understand i believe uh to a great measure i would say to perfection but i wouldn't want to be wrong and go too far but it does say that jesus christ was the expressed image of god amen i mean he believes that he perfectly expressed who god is and what god is what he he what kind of character that god is i believe if the god talked about the bible being the complete revelation of god things we know about god is part it's that he's loved i mean up to god is love and so he wanted to express that now tonight i want to speak about this expression this expression and i and i heard also on the tape but i'm talking about if somebody or if you love god then he said express it right you have to in other words it you show it and you express it so i got to thinking about this and this and you know so ty i thought tonight maybe we talk about the state of missouri for just a little bit the state of missouri now and i got a new i got a couple new one things here i i thought i had a new little quote wrote down here but i've done i don't i just it's not right there where i want it to be so i just have to go with this one because i've got a another another nickname for the state of missouri i thought it was kansas uh siri said it was missouri so it's not kansas i'm not sure what can this but anyway missouri it has the nickname of uh to be the show me right the show me state another word for it is the mother of the west they called it another place escape state i call it the doubting thomas state all right i call it that that's the new thing i call the doubting thomas state yeah why because thomas he had to be shown didn't he he would not believe until you show me you know so the touting thomas state or the show me state you know if you have love we're going to find out if we really have love what it means to say i love god that's a pretty big statement or i'm a christian or i love you you know so kind of it kind of a message of the expression you've heard before of where the rubber meeting perhaps or the evidence of it you know it's it's where it work we can say a lot of things preacher can say a lot of things and tonight without the lord i'm gonna preach on the preacher a little bit okay i preach on y'all a lot maybe maybe not maybe i never hit you at all but gonna tonight i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna hit myself with a little bit all right the preacher you know can i just say something it's better [Music] to live a sermon than it is for each one puts us on the spot don't that's right right but you know one thing about and i want to talk about god and his expressions first love actually does something about it important that i show you i mean as we come to church tonight to express what [Music] i mean as we're saved by grace not by works let me ask you what is our works by obeying god it is us expressing that to god the love that he shows us that's what works is in other words it is where he cared now the question is do you care his son on calvary [Music] when he said he loved he did it with outstretched hands he went to calvary because he loved me how many knows that um the predestinated are the only ones considered in redemption y'all remember that phrase in the message the predestinators are the only ones who knew those who would want and those who would not want and he predestinated those who he seen would want right and so when you think about it but i got to think about this this afternoon how that when god loved when he saw me before the foundation of the world and i make it personal god loved me all right god loved you and then what did he do for me he made this whole planet for me he expressed his love to me to me by creating the whole world now there's a word i left out on purpose because i want to make sure that we include more than just me right i left out the only he did not just love only me he loved others also right but think about it he's all out of you he thought of me and he loved me he loved you but that's why he made the first star the first move how many knows it did that's what god did it all for he did it all for you and for me for the ones that he loved he didn't do it for those that he didn't love him if he was going to end up with nobody with him in the first place why would he have ever done it he certainly isn't a god that doesn't end up with a prophet all right or or something comes out of it huh that's right but i thought that that's wonderful that should make us happy because we know that he did that for us don't you know the bible says the meek shall what scripture that says he made it for you he made it for the meek praise be to god tonight so everything he did was an expression of his love it was all an expression god expressing himself how many knows that when he said uh you know i'll send you elijah the prophet before the great and dead from there the lord and you know he'll you'll grow up as calves of the stalls and he'll come with healing in his wings how many knows when that happened in this generation and they'd had to take some my loads after semi loads of cots stretchers you know all these thousands of people were that was an expression of what he had thought an expression of what he had said you tonight are an expression of god we're an expression god expressing himself it's really the only thing that counts huh because even the prophet said look he said if there he said but god let there be he says but it was never light until it was what man it's really faith or not you really didn't have it you have to see them according to james 2 and verse 14. can faith save him if that brother knew that you had a freezer full of food and you had mine in the bank and you didn't do anything about it you just you know he'd go that man's a liar he does not really have love i have no confidence in his prayer right but if person doesn't have the spirit to go with it then it really can't do anything right yeah a man might say thou hast and i have works faith by my work how many believes it's better to live a sermon than it is to preach one anyway i'll just say it so yeah abraham was righteous but how many knows that god eventually tested abraham on that faith that faith did get testif tested so that he could be fully expressed when he told his after he had a son huh after he believed it for 25 years he had a son gross son grew up maybe 15 16 years old and god said something he said it's wrong god would never tell you to go murder your son no but abraham knew that voice now right he didn't understand there was no logic to it no understanding of it it's just that god said it and he knew as brother bannon did when that angel tells him something and i know that's the angle telling me i know to listen when he tells me that and abraham knew it and he went up there and he absolutely so believed it that he had just expressed his faith in god by taking that dagger and he was fixing to stab him and just as he was fixing to stab him god said now i know that you believe me that you love me right he had to test it the quote i was looking for brother baby makes a statement he says what paul saw was what god saw in abraham and what james said about works and faith he says that's what man sees right that's right works god sees whether you really have faith or not then he knows whether he believe or not but what we do is what expresses to everybody what we really are whether we praise the lord i love the thought of expression because that's what we do that's what we live every day that's why we live the way we live is because we are expressing ourselves to god for what he has already done and i thought about something and i never could have put it in the proper words like i wanted to but let me just put it to you the way that i wrote it here and the way that i thought it and i hope you get it right it's like preaching or people living for god you know sometimes you come up here and you're preaching for god or we're living you're i'm living for god you know like you're trying to serve him like you're trying to do something for him but that's not correct even preaching for god isn't necessarily correct if it's something to get me now external that you're trying to do because when it's living for god it's not about living for god what it's really about is god living for you right it's god living here so that you don't have to live it's not you doing something it's god in you doing something just like preaching danny just like preaching sometimes you want to preach don't worry about preaching just let the preacher do the preaching let god preach let god speak like jesus said the words that i speak to you they're not my words they're god the father's words right he wasn't doing something for god but he was allowing it to come through him not something external i hope everybody understands that in the way that it's said if you'll notice even jesus when it comes to the rubber meeting the road or show me [Applause] or real expressions he said if you can't believe my words what did he say then believe my works right because they shouldn't believe these words but if they can't you gotta believe the works oh my listen says jesus said the works that i do bear witness of me right the things that i do what i say is what bears record of me and that's what bears record of every person by their fruits you shall know them not by what you say huh how many please it's not what i say it's not what you say it's what you do i've heard it said many times and i believe it's true that saying it is easy living it is a different story one one you want to know one let me tell you one love your enemies do good to them who say despitefully you can mistreat you and pray for them and those that curse you bless them huh can i say something that's really really hard and that's really really easy i'm sure we got a good class tonight who could tell me the difference what makes the difference that was quick that's right if you haven't got christ it's so hard so hard you have to impersonate and try and try and you just can't do it but if you've got god in there it's easy sure it is if it's truly christ in there it's easy now let me tell you something i've had to do this many times you've had to do this many times because you went through to where you was fighting you with yourself you had to battle and fight and it was harder and harder and all get out but once you learned and committed to god oh wow man that wasn't so hard just all you had to do is give it to god [Music] he'll take care of it you have you know all the bitterness goes away all the hurt all the pain all the all that begins to just heal away and you can actually pray for the person god bless that person i've had thoughts then i've had thoughts coming to my mind saying definitely going to burn in hell i got everybody's thinking now don't we that person's definitely gonna burn it out man they've done everything wicked under the sun but then immediately the holy spirit says yeah but you wouldn't want anybody to go to hell god if at all possible save that person have mercy that's what i prayed don't have mercy on that person i don't want to see him lost it wasn't hard but the carnal mind thinks oh a person you know they deserve to go to no that's what he'll think but let the holy ghost think you have compassion no you don't wish anybody to hell that's even what the prophet said isn't that right you don't wish anybody to go there amen that's right then he says do you know i'd rather you'd live me a sermon than to preach me one it's much better it speaks louder a lived sermon is really loud how many believe that we need thousands of lived sermons lived sermons the prophet said that's what we need thundering out because it's you know because whether you know it or not how many knows that if you're a christian or even not you are a written epistle known as red of all men whether good or bad right i was searching a certain quote up and i came across where brother banham i believe he was in expressions when he was no i don't know that it wasn't there but he was talking about how when you go to preach at a funeral he said sometimes that person maybe has lived a terrible terrible terrible life and he was just not good at all but when it comes to preaching his feeling all of a sudden the man becomes good and that woman becomes good and oh they're going to be in heaven and everything else you can preach all of that and he says but you know what doesn't matter what you say he says put it this way he says those folks have already made up their mind they already know what that person was like so you're not going to convince them any different why because they're loud they're their life spoke so loud it drowned out their words amen you love him that's right was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered up fact of isaac his son upon the altar seeing thou how faith wrought with his works and by works his faith was made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which said abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called to god see ye then how that by works in man is justified and not by faith only and rahab also the harlot being justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so is faith without works is dead also so if we say we have faith but we don't have the works to go to it it means what zero means nothing how many blades do works have to be there to go with it show me right there's your missouri show me there's your thomas show me how many because that's what we got to do each and every one of us that's our job is to show people people we show each other we express to each other down here you say that you love me but i will all only know when you show it in action amen talk about words words come easy words are easy but when it comes to doing it then you better have the goods you say you love god you say love with not one another how many knows that was the one great commandment is that we love one another love one another a new commandment i give you love one another let's talk about doers ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves if any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like a man be holding his face in a natural glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgiveth what manner of man he was but whosoever looketh upon the into the perfect law of liberty and continued therian he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the word this man shall be blessed in his deed amen let me ask you this action expression the golden rule is is that we love one another and the golden rule says what but what's the first word of the golden rule did you say something sisters on these go ahead if it's wrong it's okay exactly what i would think do unto others do right do didn't say love didn't say anything else but do it's something that you do because you don't have to tell them now where i come from i remember my mom and different ones if we go back home and say why don't the amish ever tell each other that they love each other they never say i love you hardly ever say i love you and i think i remember my mom reclined he says well we show we show that you love them i think it was a good response don't you why because let me ask you this if i show you that i love you do i ever have to tell you [Applause] she just shook her head no you ain't never got to tell me remember that yeah why because that speaks loud huh that speaks louder than your words ever will she will know that you love her already [Music] huh not that we don't like to hear the words very good sister becky you're off the hook brother brother brother steven there you go sure we tell each other we love each other but it means more when we show each other all the time maybe they love each other but did they stick together no then they lost their love for each other huh [Applause] amen i've been married many many years now and i'm here to tell you that what you do for your wife means more than you'll what you'll ever say actions speak louder than words when it comes to showing people that showing your spouses that you love them amen that goes for us each and every one of us how many believe that after tonight i hope everybody understands it it's about what we show it's about what we do amen and i know it's easy i know it's easy when we're preaching something like this well i know so and so when i think about this don't just put your pitchfork somewhere else quit pitching this on somebody else and somebody out now each and every one of us people look at each other real close look at just here i'm here to say i'm guilty hello i don't express like i should sometimes and what does that mean that means i don't need reformation and just to be reminded i need more of them i mean he'll tell me he'll show you what to do amen just needs to be closer to god amen i like amens i'm going to get on to everybody but no amens no praise the lords don't you realize that's an express david dance in the spirit to express himself and his and folks how many knows that man people used to run on top of the pews they'd get so happy they couldn't hold themselves they'd run scream shout a lot of times the power of god said he says the holy spirit punctuates every word of god god we got a better better man hey man i hope that he comes that evening light tabernacle don't have no amen corners that's what happens all the time one loop no it ought to be everybody everybody ought to say amen everybody ought to say praise the lord everybody can it be all right they appreciate it hey mess what's it what does that mean i mean sikkim go get him amen praise the lord all right so now i've said it all right just get close to the lord and see if you don't like that word i don't know about you but whenever my mind makes something that's extra good i say honey you outdid yourself thank you honey for making dinner that is good you know that's what we ought to do today when god comes and he moves and he gives you something special hey man that's good don't bother me bothers me if we don't hey man so try it young people listen don't get all starchy we got to teach you from a young age that you're amen the word of god you say praise the lord you know what the problem god said says let's all say praise the lord i'll say thank you jesus thank you jesus amen praise the lord that's better god likes that all right shall we go on so we see here jesus amen he says uh let's let's just take uh we're gonna let you out early tonight but anyway let's go to saint john let's let's see what it means when you say i love god what does that mean how do you know for sure if a person loves god well it's found in saint john 14 and also first john the scripture we're from we're very familiar with but i want to go over it again is that okay i love jesus i love god everything we do let me tell you something everything we do should express our love for god but i'll tell you what jesus said that you and jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him and he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the father's which has sent me so jesus clearly another place saint john 14 around 12 13 14 there if you love me he said keep my commandments huh see how he's saying the way that you're going to express your love for god is by keeping his commandments and we all know what it's like whether it's on yourself that you see that you aren't doing what the word says or when you see somebody else amen that is not doing what the bible says all you can do is pray for that person to fall more in love with god and i guarantee you those things will fall off because if we don't love god the way that we should for one thing we're going to miss a lot of church don't really care about being there because if you love god you got the holy ghost what did the father god say you can't wait for them doors to open amen sure so when you never see people in church there's something seriously wrong with their love for god let me tell you something that's not just god because the prophet said and to fellowship with your brothers and sisters the love of god will make you want to go and fellowship with your brothers and sisters it'll make you want to shake somebody's hand and say how are you doing it you know but if you get away from god you don't really want to get around the crowd you don't want to get around that bunch that's always got a smile in their face because you ain't got to smile huh you know i get all around all these happy people you know and you just want to kind of hibernate go into some little hole somewhere and you know not have to deal with all the people's feelings and oh they didn't do this and they didn't you'll deal with all of that if you've got the holy ghost you can realize that's how human beings are you'll be able to overlook ah i don't want to go back into my counseling sessions but one time i asked somebody in counseling he says what's wrong what's wrong he said oh there's a big list there's a big list if i get into it i'm like wow that's he's holding a lot of stuff what that told me is he's holding a lot of things and my bible tells me that the holy ghost don't hold no accounts no accounts it's all gone all forgiven when you hold that many things in there you know there's some torment going on up in there didn't even want to get straightened out didn't they want to talk about huh too much to deal with already somebody needs to get to the altar because love don't hold account amen praise god you love him and last scripture tonight is first john 1 in verse 3 hereby we know that somebody knows him i'm gonna put it in a little different words is that okay this is how you know you know him this is how you know somebody else knows him if we keep his commandments there's that do word again isn't that right do something how many knows you got to keep his commandments something you got to do in other words if you're going to truly express your love for god it takes an action it takes something that you do not just something that you hear that's just something that we preach but it's an action keep his commandments for he that said oh i know god praise be to god and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him amen what if we had maybe a woman up here with short hair wearing pants and makeup like tammy baker or somebody don't like mention names but we know how it was just caked on until they were somebody else don't know for sure who they are come on folks singing amazing grace like an angel huh what would it do to you kind of turn your stomach a little maybe yeah it would make you sick because it certainly makes god sick because every action says no she don't she doesn't know grace person no grace amen when i thought about this message all i want to say is lord help me that my expressions are all christ i want him living him is him living out through me that's what i want then i'll be able to do everything that he said amen let me just say this for those of us who aren't quite perfect yet all right you may not you may know things that you're not doing that's according to the word but yet you want to serve them with all your heart that's the attitude you should have you got to have we all got to have the attitude lord i see this in my life take it
