========================================

See, the devil knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church, what she is, what she stands for, and that she can do the greater works, she will be an invincible army. Amen. She says, "If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before her." I like that phrase that the devil will be powerless before you. I thought of that when I wrote this down. And I said, "Lord, let that be. Lord, let it be to me that the devil would be powerless in your life." That means jealousy, uh, lust, sin, uh, temptation, uh, hatred, malice, all those things, you're above it. Amen. Because those are all things of the devil. bitterness, hatred, all of that. That's all of the devil to be have the t power the devil to be powerless cuz he's got to have somebody to work through. Satan will be powerless before her. He will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withtood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert. See, Satan hates revelation. We love it. with true revelation in our lives. The gates of hell will not prevail against us, but we will prevail over them. Amen. How many is glad to prevail over the devil? Be an overcomer. Oh, there's a big difference between an overcomer and somebody just says he's an overcomer. Cuz if you're not really a overcomer, you still feel the agony of defeat in your heart. You still don't have that freedom. You ain't got that liberty. You don't have that joy.
