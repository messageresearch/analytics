========================================

SO GOD IS LONGSUFFERING TOWARDS US WORK, NOT WILLING THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH, but that all might come to repentance. I want to say this. YOU HAVE TO, YOU ARE forced as a human being. You are forced to MAKE A DECISION. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE. &gt;&gt; You don't have a choice in the matter. Amen. You can't say, "Well, I'm just not going TO MAKE A CHOICE." YOU JUST DID MAKE A CHOICE. You chose to ignore a solemn warning that is given TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO WITH GOD. YOU EITHER HAVE TO accept his mercy and his grace and his love or you have to accept the judgment of God. You have to do one or the other. You must make A CHOICE OF WHICH ONE YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE, WHAT YOU'RE going to accept. You can turn your face. You can turn it off. You can not listen. But one day you're going to meet God face to face. And you are going to have to give a reason and an account of what you choice that you made.
