[27:09] i'll be cd good morning brothers and
[27:12] sisters
[27:14] like my brother thomas was saying happy
[27:16] fourth of july
[27:19] you know it's a funny thing about our
[27:21] country in the world we live in
[27:23] i could mention some places that most
[27:25] young men and women wouldn't even know
[27:27] where they're at
[27:27] in the world today but i was just
[27:29] thinking you know today's july 4th but
[27:33] on july 4th 1863 the two opposing forces
[27:37] were recovering from
[27:38] thousands of men given their lives that
[27:41] after faith in you know july 31 the
[27:43] battle of gettysburg was over
[27:45] and on july 4th two opposing forces were
[27:48] withdrawn from each other
[27:50] with thousands of dead and wounded men
[27:53] you know and sometimes people forget how
[27:57] life is i was just thinking this morning
[28:00] let me just
[28:03] when i when i look at you or you look at
[28:05] me
[28:07] you don't see you don't really see me or
[28:10] and i really don't see you there's only
[28:13] one entity god himself is the only one
[28:15] when he looks at you or looks at me
[28:18] he actually sees the real you whether it
[28:21] female or male he sees the real you
[28:24] nothing and you can't matter nothing i
[28:27] can do can manufacture that that's
[28:29] something god does for us
[28:31] i know i say that a lot i can't say it
[28:34] enough
[28:34] but if you would go with me to
[28:37] second corinthians the 13th chapter
[28:42] and you know
[28:46] i was just thinking about that you i can
[28:48] mention some places and
[28:50] i don't know if they don't they choose
[28:51] not to teach
[28:53] our country's history the way it should
[28:55] be taught anymore but
[28:57] you know i could mention numerous places
[29:00] that people wouldn't even know
[29:01] anymore because they just don't teach it
[29:03] i don't they
[29:05] you just think of i don't know eight you
[29:08] take a simple year like
[29:10] 1776 most people wouldn't know that the
[29:13] first four years of the revolutionary
[29:16] war were
[29:17] a dark time for the colonists they
[29:20] didn't really have
[29:21] any real significant victories i mean
[29:23] they had little battles they won
[29:25] but it was a struggle the first three to
[29:27] four years of the war
[29:28] it almost looked like it was over you
[29:31] know and then they had some victories
[29:32] and then it accelerated and they won
[29:35] you know you wouldn't know that today
[29:37] they don't teach that
[29:38] kind of stuff to the people you know it
[29:40] was it was a real dark hour back then in
[29:42] the turn
[29:44] turn of the century back then it was
[29:46] just god's grace that
[29:47] there is the united states of america
[29:50] this morning
[29:50] and you sit in a free country even
[29:53] though you can choose
[29:54] to believe the way you want to believe
[29:56] you can choose to go
[29:57] where you want to go you know i've been
[29:59] all over the world but
[30:00] the united states is one of the few
[30:02] countries that you can go
[30:04] 1500 miles and not have a passport or
[30:07] have papers to go from one area
[30:10] to the other area that's a blessing you
[30:12] people take for granted
[30:14] um but bringing it back this uh
[30:17] chapter and second corinthians the 13th
[30:20] chapter here
[30:21] this kind of speaks for today where
[30:23] we're at and uh paul had this to say
[30:26] this is the third time i'm coming to you
[30:29] in the mouth of
[30:30] two or three witnesses shall every word
[30:32] be established
[30:34] and i've told you before and foretell
[30:36] you foretold you
[30:37] as if i were president second time being
[30:40] absent now i write to them which
[30:43] herefore have sinned and to all others i
[30:46] if i come again i will not spare so he's
[30:49] speaking to the churches in corinthian
[30:52] you know telling them that he's sending
[30:54] letters to
[30:55] bring them back to the truth but then he
[30:57] goes on it's like
[30:58] since you seek the proof of christ
[31:00] speaking in me
[31:02] which is to you word is not weak but is
[31:04] mighty in you
[31:06] for though he was crucified through
[31:08] weakness yet he liveth by the power of
[31:11] god
[31:11] for we also are weak in him but we shall
[31:14] live with him
[31:15] by the power of god towards you and this
[31:18] is
[31:18] really important scripture for this
[31:21] fifth one here
[31:22] for the age that we live in you know uh
[31:24] i can't examine you
[31:26] your pastor can you gotta examine
[31:28] yourself and
[31:29] this is what paul examined yourself
[31:31] whether you be in the faith
[31:33] prove your own self know you not your
[31:35] own selves
[31:37] that jesus christ is in you except you
[31:39] be reprobate so
[31:41] paul's given two contrasts here you've
[31:43] got to examine yourself you've got to
[31:46] know where you're
[31:47] where you're at in the in the age that
[31:50] you're in right now this morning
[31:51] and he's saying to examine yourselves
[31:54] and
[31:56] only you know if jesus christ is living
[31:58] and abiding in your heart that's what i
[31:59] was saying earlier
[32:01] i can look at you all i see is the
[32:03] outward presentation
[32:04] that i that i live with every day but
[32:07] god really knows you
[32:08] on the inside he knows inside your heart
[32:11] he knows inside your mind and the
[32:14] problem with some people god isn't in
[32:15] their heart he's in their mind and it
[32:17] never gets down
[32:19] to the heart and those kind of people
[32:21] are all over the plate
[32:22] using a baseball ism there they're just
[32:25] all over the place they don't
[32:26] consistently
[32:28] walk that line in their lives where
[32:30] they're the same person i said that last
[32:32] week i said
[32:33] the week before but i can't say are you
[32:35] the same person
[32:37] when i see you here are you the same
[32:39] person when you're at work are you the
[32:40] same person when you're playing whatever
[32:42] you're doing
[32:43] are you still the same person that's the
[32:45] same god abiding you
[32:47] at work that abides in you that's
[32:49] sitting here this morning
[32:50] in this church only you know that i i
[32:53] don't know that
[32:54] and he goes on to say examine yourselves
[32:56] whether you be in the faith
[32:58] prove your own selves know you're not
[32:59] your own self that in jesus christ is in
[33:02] you
[33:03] except you be reprobates and i know
[33:04] there's no reprobates here this morning
[33:07] but i trust that you shall know that we
[33:09] are not reprobates
[33:10] now i pray you to god you do not
[33:14] know evil that you should appear or
[33:16] prove or prove
[33:18] excuse me but that you should do that
[33:20] which is honest
[33:22] though we be as reprobates so he's
[33:24] saying
[33:26] people might look at you as a reprobate
[33:27] but you know who you are
[33:29] and everything we do we do honestly for
[33:31] we can do nothing against the truth
[33:34] but for the truth for we are glad when
[33:37] we are weak
[33:38] we ye are strong this also we
[33:41] excuse me i'm not reading these things
[33:43] right fear or glad when we are we
[33:46] you are strong and and this also we wish
[33:49] that
[33:50] even your perfection therefore i write
[33:52] these things
[33:54] being absent unless being present i
[33:56] should use your sharpness according to
[33:58] the power which the lord hath given me
[34:01] to edification and not to destruction so
[34:03] paul
[34:04] saying here that in and what
[34:07] was read in the uh in the psalms it's in
[34:10] god doesn't use the strength of the
[34:12] horse he doesn't use the strength of
[34:14] man he doesn't use the strength of a
[34:17] government
[34:18] he uses weakness just simple weakness
[34:20] people submitting to him
[34:22] and to the spirit of christ that's what
[34:24] god uses and he goes on
[34:26] to say therefore i write these things
[34:28] being absent least being present i
[34:30] should use sharpness according to the
[34:32] power
[34:32] which the lord hath given me to
[34:34] edification
[34:36] and not to destruction finally brethren
[34:38] farewell be perfect be of one comfort
[34:41] and be of one mind live in peace and
[34:43] with god
[34:46] of love and peace shall be with you you
[34:48] know uh
[34:50] god is asking us paul is asking us to be
[34:52] perfect
[34:53] can you be perfect in yourself no the
[34:55] only way you can be perfect
[34:56] is in god's word this morning and let me
[34:59] jump over here since i have a
[35:01] thompson chain reference bible here
[35:04] and i probably didn't write down what i
[35:06] should have wrote down
[35:08] let me see if i can find it again this
[35:14] morning
[35:22] uh if you have a thompson chain
[35:24] reference you can turn turn the page 15
[35:26] 20. you know we have to examine
[35:29] ourselves
[35:31] every day every morning every hour you
[35:33] know brother branham said you shouldn't
[35:35] go to bed at night
[35:36] unless you need to write whatever that
[35:38] is in your heart or in your life
[35:40] and uh lamentations the third chapter
[35:43] and the 40
[35:44] it says let us search and try our ways
[35:47] and return again to the lord
[35:49] and it goes back to what paul was saying
[35:51] in the 13th chapter of second
[35:52] corinthians
[35:54] you got to examine yourself are you the
[35:57] same person you were 40 years ago like i
[35:59] said last sunday
[36:00] are you a different person the
[36:03] desires that you had in your heart 10
[36:06] years ago five
[36:07] are they the same desires that you have
[36:09] in your heart this morning
[36:10] and then matthew 7 which i read a lot
[36:14] too
[36:14] it um val hypocrite first cast out the
[36:18] beam out of thine own eye
[36:20] and thou shalt seek clearly to cast out
[36:22] more out of thy brother's iron
[36:24] and that's a perfect example of the
[36:26] world we live in everyone sees everyone
[36:28] else's faults
[36:29] you know they always look at everyone
[36:31] else they always
[36:33] condemn everyone else they never lift
[36:35] anyone else up that's the age we're in
[36:38] very rarely do you have a kind of person
[36:41] that looks deep inside himself
[36:43] before he even tries to help someone
[36:45] else you know what he's saying here
[36:47] is before you see something wrong with
[36:49] someone else you really got to examine
[36:51] yourself are you doing
[36:52] are you doing the same thing yourself
[36:54] and you're about to tell someone else to
[36:56] stop doing something you're doing
[36:58] yourself
[36:58] and i like i said again when i look at
[37:01] you
[37:04] i can't see the real you god sees the
[37:06] real you and it's the same with me
[37:08] is god in this heart of mind is he in
[37:11] this life of mine
[37:12] showing me who i really am and it takes
[37:15] a lot of prayer
[37:16] takes a lot of humility a lot of self
[37:19] seeking before the lord just have god
[37:22] show you
[37:23] who you really are and what you are and
[37:25] he goes on to say
[37:26] here in in corinthians first corinthians
[37:30] 11 and 28
[37:31] but let amen and this is part of the
[37:34] communion service it says
[37:36] but let a man examine yourself so let
[37:38] him eat of the bread and drink of that
[37:40] cup
[37:40] and paul goes talks in that chapter how
[37:43] every man should examine himself
[37:45] and see if he's in the faith and then
[37:48] second i just read second
[37:51] corinthians 13 if let me see if i can
[37:53] jump here
[37:55] if you'll jump with me to matthew the
[37:57] seventh chapter
[38:10] yeah i'm one of those kind of people to
[38:12] get in there everything i do has to be
[38:15] fast
[38:15] i'm not one of those guys that draws
[38:17] back for something and takes his time
[38:19] if anyone knows me you know that about
[38:21] me i'm
[38:23] i'm not one of those kind of people uh
[38:27] and it goes to what i was reading and
[38:29] this is what jesus had to say
[38:32] you know as i i was thinking the world
[38:34] we live in
[38:36] they they like to take what christ said
[38:38] one place
[38:39] and they forget about what he said
[38:41] somewhere else so they twisted so much
[38:44] they make him say things he didn't
[38:46] say or do things that he didn't do
[38:49] but this is simply what he said here
[38:52] judge not
[38:52] and you be not judged for with the
[38:55] judgment you judge you shall be judged
[38:57] and with the measure you might it shall
[38:59] be measured to you
[39:00] again and i've read this one already and
[39:03] that why beholdest thou the mode in my
[39:04] brother's eye consider
[39:06] not the being in their own eyes and like
[39:08] i said
[39:09] you have to have a life before the lord
[39:11] where he can show you who you really are
[39:13] before
[39:14] you can before you can have help anyone
[39:16] else you've got to help yourself
[39:17] to get into that position and how will
[39:20] thou say to thy brother let me pull out
[39:22] the moat out of an
[39:23] eye behold the beam that it is in their
[39:26] own eye
[39:26] thou hypocrite first cast out the beam
[39:29] out of their
[39:30] own eye and thou shalt see clearly to
[39:32] cast a moat out of that brother's eye
[39:34] you know that's the way life is we see
[39:37] issues in other people that we think are
[39:39] so
[39:40] big uh but maybe in god's eyes it's
[39:44] not a big issue for them you might have
[39:47] an issue that god might think is even
[39:49] bigger than their issue
[39:50] like i said that's what people are they
[39:53] they don't they don't want to see the tr
[39:55] see themselves for who they really are
[39:57] and he goes on
[39:59] he goes on jesus says here give not that
[40:02] which is holy on the dogs
[40:03] neither cast your pearls before swine at
[40:06] least they trample under their feet
[40:08] and turn again around you ask and it
[40:10] shall be given seek and you shall find
[40:12] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[40:14] for everyone that asks receive it and he
[40:17] that seeketh find that to him that knock
[40:19] it it should be open
[40:20] and i would just end with that scripture
[40:23] this morning
[40:25] are you knocking enough are you seeking
[40:27] enough are you desiring enough to see
[40:29] god do something for you in your life
[40:32] you know we all have plateaus in our
[40:34] life we all have
[40:35] valleys we all have ups and downs
[40:39] you shouldn't be in the down your whole
[40:40] life you should be living in a valley
[40:42] you should have some victories i'm not
[40:44] i'm not laughing at your
[40:46] i have my rises and my falls i'm just
[40:49] saying
[40:50] your life shouldn't be a deadline you
[40:51] shouldn't have a you should like a dead
[40:53] person you shouldn't have a single line
[40:55] going one direction
[40:56] your life should have ups and downs you
[40:58] should have great moments
[41:00] you might have some slow moments but
[41:02] everybody has to have that time in their
[41:04] lives where god
[41:06] raises you up and lifts you down you
[41:08] know we all have to move forward you
[41:10] know that's the one thing about
[41:14] life you have to keep going forward in
[41:16] life and you have to keep desiring
[41:18] to see god do something for you in life
[41:21] that's greater than the day before
[41:23] you have to count on his grace and his
[41:25] mercy and everything that you say
[41:27] and do brother david

[46:04] sister parrish and sister peggy smith
[46:06] and the different ones so god bless you
[46:09] this morning and
[46:10] i thought my what a beautiful day and
[46:14] as brother brian talked about the 4th of
[46:17] july and
[46:18] we take we take so much for granted
[46:21] in our lives being americans because we
[46:25] are truly a blessed people
[46:27] and then on the spiritual side
[46:31] to have the message come in our language
[46:34] that
[46:35] god blessed us with in this hour to not
[46:37] have to go through an interpreter and
[46:39] have
[46:39] everything that our access
[46:43] that we have need of and you know
[46:46] when i was growing up it was real to
[46:48] reels but now the message lays
[46:50] right there any message you want to hear
[46:53] the prophets speak
[46:55] all you have to do is type it in and
[46:57] he'll play it for you
[47:00] what a blessing this is this morning and
[47:02] i thought you know lord you gave us our
[47:04] freedom naturally and
[47:06] like brother brian said i thought about
[47:07] that the other day i thought you know
[47:09] we want to go somewhere we get in the
[47:11] car we just go
[47:12] we don't have to be stopped and we don't
[47:14] have to be searched and
[47:16] looked at and i thought to live in a
[47:19] country and then for god to bless us in
[47:21] such a way and
[47:23] mine's just it's just an honor i think
[47:26] i think it's an honor brother branham
[47:28] said you know we live in america he said
[47:30] even though all her problems he said but
[47:33] it's still the greatest place in the
[47:34] world to be to live

[1:10:08] our praise
[1:10:09] you can have your seats for just a few
[1:10:11] minutes if you'd like
[1:10:14] so happy fourth of july i know we've got
[1:10:17] some in here that had fought for our
[1:10:19] freedoms and we thank you for that and
[1:10:21] it's something that seems to be taken
[1:10:22] for granted nowadays and
[1:10:25] and just how blessed and fortunate we
[1:10:27] are to to have
[1:10:28] those down through history that has
[1:10:30] fought for the the freedoms that we have
[1:10:32] um just a quick little testimony if we
[1:10:35] if we might take a minute here while
[1:10:37] you're
[1:10:37] while you're sitting um i think brother
[1:10:40] david may mention last week that
[1:10:42] weston was gone out to oklahoma and just
[1:10:44] to show you how
[1:10:45] how fortunate and blessed we we truly
[1:10:48] are even
[1:10:49] uh just just to say maybe we live where
[1:10:52] we live in kentucky
[1:10:53] uh how thankful we should be for our
[1:10:56] independence and our freedom and
[1:10:58] they were he was out there working with
[1:11:01] a couple of churches from a school
[1:11:02] and working with the native american
[1:11:05] children
[1:11:06] and oto is that right oto
[1:11:09] oto oklahoma and
[1:11:13] the work out there was started years ago
[1:11:15] by actually a minister from
[1:11:16] here in todd county uh
[1:11:22] i went blank jimmy kenner yeah jimmy
[1:11:25] kenner
[1:11:26] uh brother jimmy kenner started up there
[1:11:28] the lord laid on his heart to go out
[1:11:29] there in oklahoma years ago
[1:11:31] to to work with the uh the native
[1:11:34] american indians out there and
[1:11:36] on the reservations and just see what he
[1:11:37] could do to lead them lead them to
[1:11:39] christ and
[1:11:40] it's been a very good work it's been a
[1:11:41] hard work for him i know i went out
[1:11:43] there i guess it was two years ago
[1:11:46] we actually took our baseball team out
[1:11:48] there to do some a little bit of work
[1:11:50] and just
[1:11:50] witness and see the the children and try
[1:11:52] to help
[1:11:54] but it's been a hard work we talk about
[1:11:56] our independence and where we live
[1:11:58] and where we live here we got pretty
[1:12:00] much the freedoms that we want
[1:12:02] and and you know you get along pretty
[1:12:04] good with your neighbor but
[1:12:06] you can imagine a white man going out
[1:12:08] into the indian reservations and
[1:12:10] knocking on a door
[1:12:11] and saying i'd like to tell you about
[1:12:12] christ well he's had several doors
[1:12:14] slammed in his face literally
[1:12:16] so it's not been an easy road for for
[1:12:18] bro jimmy out there but
[1:12:21] just to tell you how thankful we should
[1:12:22] be for our freedom and independence
[1:12:24] westin said there was about 150
[1:12:26] uh children there and uh
[1:12:30] out of those 150 three of them went home
[1:12:33] to parents
[1:12:34] that lived in a home together with a
[1:12:36] mother and a father
[1:12:37] out of 153 went home to but
[1:12:40] a mom and a dad in the same household uh
[1:12:44] and most of those children went home to
[1:12:46] a grandparent
[1:12:47] uh the other that was left out of the
[1:12:49] 150.
[1:12:51] um and so you know we i know today's
[1:12:54] missionary
[1:12:55] sunday and and we we send missionary
[1:12:58] work around the world and
[1:12:59] and and we're very thankful to be able
[1:13:01] to do that but sometimes we
[1:13:03] fail to look within a few miles of us
[1:13:05] sometimes
[1:13:07] the children many of them he said didn't
[1:13:09] have shoes
[1:13:10] that fit they would they would walk in
[1:13:13] on the backs of their shoes because
[1:13:15] their shoes didn't fit when they got the
[1:13:16] opportunity to take their shoes off they
[1:13:18] just run barefooted
[1:13:19] because i'm sure their feet were hurting
[1:13:21] so you know there's just a lot of things
[1:13:23] uh on this fourth of july that we got to
[1:13:25] be thankful for in our own little part
[1:13:28] of the world here so
[1:13:30] just kind of let you know what he was
[1:13:31] doing out there and it was with the
[1:13:33] several different uh churches i think
[1:13:36] probably most of them were baptist
[1:13:37] churches but
[1:13:38] just want to try to get the word to the
[1:13:39] children and the children love to come
[1:13:42] and they
[1:13:42] love to hear the word of god and they
[1:13:44] love to the fellowship
[1:13:46] and so you just trust that over the
[1:13:49] years and over the time
[1:13:51] spent that they just continue to get
[1:13:54] children
[1:13:55] softened and closer to christ and you
[1:13:57] know
[1:13:58] we've heard the prophet tell about it if
[1:13:59] you're i think if you get a kid
[1:14:02] if you can lead them to christ when
[1:14:03] they're young age three to five
[1:14:06] they'll serve christ the rest of their
[1:14:08] life and i actually just heard a
[1:14:09] preacher
[1:14:09] he was preaching about that on the radio
[1:14:11] this week and the importance of our kids
[1:14:14] being in church and in sunday schools
[1:14:17] and then
[1:14:18] in the word and so um
[1:14:21] something there that's it's a good work
[1:14:22] out there and just pray for brother
[1:14:24] jimmy and
[1:14:25] that he'll be able to continue doing
[1:14:26] that but that's where he was at and
[1:14:28] thankful that he got that experience
[1:14:30] because
[1:14:30] like i said a lot of times we take for
[1:14:32] granted what's going on a couple hundred
[1:14:33] miles down the road from us
[1:14:35] because we live in our own little world
[1:14:37] and that's just the way it is
[1:14:39] we are accustomed to what we have around
[1:14:41] us so
[1:14:42] if we would let's just stand
[1:14:46] turn in your bibles to the book of
[1:14:54] joshua
[1:14:59] look at joshua chapter 12 i think it's
[1:15:03] 7 there joshua 7.
[1:15:16] we'll try not to hold too long today
[1:15:18] we've got the communion lords
[1:15:20] communion here and i will try to
[1:15:22] transition
[1:15:23] smoothly over into that and um turn to
[1:15:26] the service to brother byler at the end
[1:15:28] here
[1:15:29] but we want to look at a few things this
[1:15:31] morning talking about
[1:15:33] uh aiken we're going to look at aiken
[1:15:36] and joshua and the battles they fought
[1:15:38] and
[1:15:38] and how aiken's life was uh was
[1:15:42] involved so much in the way things went
[1:15:44] there with the children of israel so
[1:15:46] joshua 7 but the children of israel
[1:15:49] committed a trespass and the accursed
[1:15:52] thing
[1:15:53] for achan the son of karmy the son of
[1:15:56] zebe the son of zerah of the tribe of
[1:15:59] judah took
[1:16:01] of the accursed thing now watch now
[1:16:04] and the anger of the lord was kindled
[1:16:07] against
[1:16:08] who the children of israel
[1:16:11] let's just bow our heads heavenly father
[1:16:13] we thank you lord for this day you've
[1:16:15] given us for our independence and
[1:16:16] freedom that was
[1:16:17] bravely fought for our forefathers and
[1:16:20] and those that are still fighting today
[1:16:22] and it seems many times that we uh
[1:16:24] we we fall short and we we feel
[1:16:26] restricted and some of our freedoms are
[1:16:28] being taken away but lord
[1:16:29] you've blessed us to live in the
[1:16:30] greatest nation in the world lord and
[1:16:32] we're thankful for that lord and for all
[1:16:35] you the goodness that you showed to us

[1:16:39] reading of the word went forth lord we
[1:16:41] just ask that we could be able to look
[1:16:42] at this and examine it

[1:17:00] the bride this morning if we're not
[1:17:01] ready if we're not right
[1:17:03] the that the word of the lord would come
[1:17:05] down and speak to our hearts to draw us
[1:17:07] close and near to you
[1:17:08] lord we just want to tell you we love
[1:17:10] you and we appreciate you in jesus name
[1:17:12] amen amen you can have your seats
[1:17:16] so brother branham's talking here and
[1:17:17] he's talking about
[1:17:19] joshua and what's going on with aiken
[1:17:21] and he says joshua after he crossed over
[1:17:24] into the land
[1:17:25] god gave him promise to fight an entire
[1:17:28] campaign
[1:17:29] without losing a man without even
[1:17:32] getting a scratch without even having a
[1:17:34] nurse or a first aid or a
[1:17:37] a bandage he said god said the land is
[1:17:40] yours go
[1:17:40] fight think of it a fighting a campaign
[1:17:44] and there's no red cross around there's
[1:17:46] nobody gonna get
[1:17:47] hurt brother sister god makes some
[1:17:49] amazing promises god makes some
[1:17:52] amazing promises in in life and he don't
[1:17:54] back down on his promises but what we do
[1:17:57] with his promises
[1:17:58] affect the outcome of the situation
[1:18:01] brother brown said among them
[1:18:02] he said and he's they slayed the
[1:18:04] amorites
[1:18:06] and they slayed the hittites and and
[1:18:08] there wasn't one
[1:18:09] hurt among them until sin
[1:18:12] come in the camp and when aiken took
[1:18:16] that babylonian garment
[1:18:18] and that gold wedge and he hid it under
[1:18:21] his camp
[1:18:22] and then the next day they lost 36 men
[1:18:25] joshua said stop stop wait a minute
[1:18:28] there's something wrong
[1:18:30] something's wrong here we're going to
[1:18:33] call seven days of fast because
[1:18:35] god made us a promise and there would be
[1:18:38] nothing to hurt us
[1:18:39] and our enemies will fall at our feet so
[1:18:41] something is wrong
[1:18:43] here something went wrong because we got
[1:18:46] 36 dead men laying here
[1:18:49] our israelite brothers and they're dead
[1:18:53] why did they die innocent man he said
[1:18:56] because one man stepped out of line you
[1:18:59] see this is the reason it has to be
[1:19:01] taught
[1:19:02] that's what he said this is the reason
[1:19:04] this has to be taught
[1:19:06] and it has to be taught not because we
[1:19:08] want to uh pick people apart not because
[1:19:10] we want to throw stones not because we
[1:19:12] want to
[1:19:12] make people feel less than what they are
[1:19:15] but i liked what brother ben how he
[1:19:16] brought it out on wednesday night
[1:19:18] that there is a day and a time we have
[1:19:20] to get ourselves right with god
[1:19:23] we can't just continually keep preaching
[1:19:25] and preaching you're the bride you're
[1:19:26] the bride
[1:19:27] because eventually you get in your mind
[1:19:28] that you are the bride and that's what
[1:19:30] we want we are the bride
[1:19:32] but we got to be careful that we won't
[1:19:34] get out such of our mind that we're the
[1:19:35] bride that's
[1:19:36] thoughtless on earth
[1:19:40] we can't get to a place so high but we
[1:19:42] don't even see our own mistakes
[1:19:44] is what i'm trying to say we don't even
[1:19:45] see our own failures that we begin to
[1:19:48] think things that are that maybe we
[1:19:50] didn't used to think we're okay but now
[1:19:51] they're okay we begin to start these
[1:19:53] things start creeping into our lives
[1:19:57] he said why did they die innocent man
[1:19:59] because one man
[1:20:00] stepped out of line you see there's a
[1:20:03] reason it has to be taught the church
[1:20:05] lining up lining up with the word of god
[1:20:09] he said lining up with the word of god
[1:20:11] lining up with each other walking
[1:20:12] perfectly
[1:20:14] upright soberly before all men fearing
[1:20:17] god
[1:20:18] it's not just enough to be called the
[1:20:20] bride you know there's a lot of brides
[1:20:24] a lot of churches call themselves the
[1:20:25] bride but are they walking upright
[1:20:29] are they walking soberly are they are
[1:20:31] they doing all this before men are they
[1:20:33] are they fearing god in the way that the
[1:20:34] bride of christ truly should fear god
[1:20:37] it's a good question now good question
[1:20:39] he said there's something wrong
[1:20:41] god made the promise and he says listen
[1:20:44] when we bring up the sick before us
[1:20:47] and they fail to be healed we need to
[1:20:50] call a solemn fast
[1:20:52] call an assembly because something's
[1:20:54] wrong somewhere
[1:20:55] god made the promise god's got to stick
[1:20:58] to that promise and he will do it
[1:21:00] and he said joshua called for a fast and
[1:21:04] they found out and they cast lots and
[1:21:06] aiken
[1:21:06] confessed it and they killed aiken
[1:21:11] family and all and burnt them and
[1:21:14] took their ashes and left it for a
[1:21:16] memorial and joshua went
[1:21:18] right on through the battles taking
[1:21:21] everything without scratch
[1:21:23] or wound
[1:21:28] so we look here and we see here in
[1:21:29] joshua six and seven
[1:21:31] this is a tragic story of aiken and his
[1:21:34] sin
[1:21:35] now i'm going to try my best to go
[1:21:37] through history and slow things down and
[1:21:39] you're probably going to hear a lot of
[1:21:40] stuff that maybe you haven't really
[1:21:42] thought about or brought out but it's
[1:21:44] part of the history of the life of aiken
[1:21:46] and i think if we look at it we can tie
[1:21:47] it right down to where we was because
[1:21:49] here's aiken one man
[1:21:53] sinned by stealing a garment 200 shekels
[1:21:56] of silver and a wedge of gold
[1:21:58] after the heat of the battle and he was
[1:22:00] instructed do not take any of the
[1:22:02] treasures
[1:22:04] from jericho the treasures of jericho
[1:22:06] they are to be devoted to god
[1:22:08] so keep in mind here that aiken had no
[1:22:11] accomplice
[1:22:13] there was no witnesses so there was
[1:22:15] nobody that knew he'd done it nobody
[1:22:17] could
[1:22:18] could point him out he had no accusers
[1:22:20] but nonetheless
[1:22:22] because of what he did the israelites
[1:22:24] were now
[1:22:25] paralyzed with fear when they go to
[1:22:28] attack
[1:22:29] the city of i.e
[1:22:34] the whole nation of israel their fate
[1:22:36] depends upon
[1:22:37] this one person
[1:22:41] do you see how important your life is
[1:22:43] and how important you and your organ and
[1:22:44] the orchestration of god your life is
[1:22:46] into the plan of god
[1:22:48] again his life was was determining the
[1:22:51] whole outcome of what was about to
[1:22:53] happen 36 men died
[1:22:57] wives were widowed children lost their
[1:22:59] father
[1:23:00] and in the end aiken's entire family
[1:23:02] destroyed even though they were innocent
[1:23:04] of his sin
[1:23:09] the whole nation affected
[1:23:12] that's what god said god said it was a
[1:23:14] national sin you look in verses 10 and
[1:23:16] 12
[1:23:17] and he says joshua get up israel
[1:23:20] hath sinned and transgressed against my
[1:23:24] covenant
[1:23:25] he didn't say joshua get up aiken is the
[1:23:28] one
[1:23:30] israel has transgressed
[1:23:34] the whole nation has transgressed
[1:23:36] against me because of what one man
[1:23:39] has done so brothers and sisters
[1:23:43] realize that it's more than just an
[1:23:45] individualized walk in our life
[1:23:47] and we do serve god in an individual
[1:23:50] basis god deals with each one of us
[1:23:52] individually on a day by day basis but
[1:23:54] it's bigger than that
[1:23:55] we may be individually but we're walking
[1:23:58] in this together we're not walking alone
[1:24:01] and a lot of times people fail to
[1:24:03] realize that god
[1:24:04] is god is wanting to see his bride move
[1:24:06] in a unit
[1:24:08] and we need to be another we need to be
[1:24:11] lifting one another we need to be
[1:24:12] working with one another
[1:24:13] and keeping in constant step with what
[1:24:16] god wants
[1:24:16] this church this part of the bride of
[1:24:19] christ to be doing
[1:24:22] brother branham said on july the 3rd of
[1:24:25] 1964
[1:24:27] he said he fell into a trance and he
[1:24:30] said when i did there was somebody with
[1:24:32] me he said i didn't see the person but i
[1:24:34] just
[1:24:34] heard the voice and he said i looked and
[1:24:37] he said the bride will come in for
[1:24:39] preview
[1:24:41] you've seen this you heard this you know
[1:24:42] the story and he said i looked and
[1:24:44] coming to me i seen the most
[1:24:47] prettiest bunch of clean dressed women i
[1:24:49] ever seen in my life
[1:24:51] each one of them long hair long sleeves
[1:24:54] and
[1:24:54] long skirts and so forth young women i'd
[1:24:57] say in
[1:24:57] about 20. and he said
[1:25:00] but this bride her eyes she was the
[1:25:04] cleanest
[1:25:05] sweetest looking people i've ever seen
[1:25:08] in my life he said i don't know how many
[1:25:11] it was he said
[1:25:13] it was uh they were in the ground in the
[1:25:16] around about them
[1:25:17] but she passed by sweetly with an air
[1:25:22] there was an air about this group of
[1:25:24] ladies that walked by him
[1:25:26] that was the bride and the vision there
[1:25:28] was an air about them the upright
[1:25:31] they stood before god knowing who they
[1:25:33] were
[1:25:34] not as one person but as a group of
[1:25:37] ladies that stood and walked in line
[1:25:39] in tune together
[1:25:42] and he said next
[1:25:45] he said next we'll review the churches
[1:25:50] and they come and i notice them coming
[1:25:52] up each one of them and it looked like
[1:25:53] they
[1:25:54] got worse and worse he said i've never
[1:25:57] seen such a filthy bunch
[1:25:59] in my life he said and then i said next
[1:26:02] i heard a voice and it said
[1:26:03] here comes the american group
[1:26:08] here comes the american group and he
[1:26:10] said now i'm an american and he said but
[1:26:12] this just made me sick
[1:26:14] he said i'm not even elegant enough to
[1:26:16] to to speak about it in a mixed audience
[1:26:18] what was taking place you'll have to
[1:26:20] read between the lines
[1:26:23] what kind of day are we living in
[1:26:27] he said but these women were coming and
[1:26:28] the leader of them was a witch
[1:26:31] she had a great long nose and a big
[1:26:33] mouth and was dressed in some kind of
[1:26:34] lower clothes down here in the top with
[1:26:36] just a strap
[1:26:37] about a half inch strap and and and
[1:26:40] moving around them like this and
[1:26:42] he and he said the parts were exposed
[1:26:45] and he said cut hair and frizzy looking
[1:26:48] and real short and full of makeup
[1:26:49] nothing but look like a bunch of street
[1:26:51] prostitutes
[1:26:55] and he's looking at this vision 57 years
[1:26:57] ago and i think he can be seen from
[1:26:59] yesterday
[1:27:02] and he's looking at this vision 57 years
[1:27:04] ago
[1:27:05] and he said is that the church
[1:27:08] is that the church and he said there she
[1:27:10] went and they were singing and twisting
[1:27:12] to the rock and roll songs and
[1:27:13] and going down here and and moving this
[1:27:16] way in that way
[1:27:17] and they left and disappeared into chaos
[1:27:19] still marching to the beat of that music
[1:27:23] into chaos
[1:27:26] and he said i just started to bow my
[1:27:28] head
[1:27:29] and i said wait the bride has to
[1:27:33] come again the bride must come again he
[1:27:36] said i looked and
[1:27:37] here they come and they pass by them
[1:27:39] sweet looking ladies and i noticed each
[1:27:41] one of them
[1:27:42] their hair down the back looked like
[1:27:43] these were from germany
[1:27:45] they took german or something like that
[1:27:46] as i watched them and he said they
[1:27:48] started
[1:27:48] leaving and two or three of them in the
[1:27:50] back kind of got out of step
[1:27:54] so here's that group of bride from the
[1:27:56] beginning that's walking the straight
[1:27:57] and narrow they're all in tune they're
[1:27:59] marching together they're all on the
[1:28:01] same mission they're upright they're
[1:28:02] going forward
[1:28:03] the most beautiful group then he sees
[1:28:05] america the most filthy bunch he's ever
[1:28:07] seen polluted
[1:28:08] and then the bride comes back through
[1:28:10] and he's watching but now something's
[1:28:11] happened
[1:28:12] one of them or two of them three of them
[1:28:13] in the back is starting to fall to the
[1:28:15] side a little bit
[1:28:17] they're kind of getting off the word
[1:28:19] just a little bit they're they're kind
[1:28:20] of leaving this way he said and i wanted
[1:28:22] to holler at him he's in a vision he
[1:28:24] says i wanted to holler at him
[1:28:33] he said but then i seen them and they
[1:28:35] was trying to get back in step
[1:28:39] so here's the bride and she's walking
[1:28:41] and there's a few of them that's trying
[1:28:42] to start getting and then he said no i
[1:28:44] was going to holler at them
[1:28:45] but no i seen them they started getting
[1:28:46] herself back in step
[1:28:48] why because they knew who they were they
[1:28:50] knew that they had to walk in unison
[1:28:52] it's more than an individual it's a
[1:28:54] group
[1:28:54] effort
[1:28:58] and i like what brother ben said the
[1:29:00] other night
[1:29:03] i like when he said it's up to the
[1:29:05] pastors and preachers
[1:29:07] it's their job to meddle in your
[1:29:08] business
[1:29:12] i don't know if you liked it
[1:29:16] and my flesh didn't like it
[1:29:19] i'll be honest i'm thinking nobody build
[1:29:20] my own business
[1:29:23] don't nobody need to be in my business
[1:29:24] but that's not the truth
[1:29:26] we need people to get into our business
[1:29:28] and meddle in our business because we
[1:29:29] become so complacent with life we become
[1:29:32] so complacent
[1:29:33] with a word that things like i said that
[1:29:35] we used to wouldn't do it begins to
[1:29:36] creep in
[1:29:37] we find ourselves getting out of step we
[1:29:39] need somebody to holler
[1:29:42] we need somebody to holler and to get
[1:29:44] into our business
[1:29:45] and let me tell you brother and sister
[1:29:47] if the pastor can't look at you directly
[1:29:49] in the eyes
[1:29:50] and tell you you're wrong in the right
[1:29:54] kind of way and say
[1:29:55] i'm telling you this because i want you
[1:29:56] to get right with god
[1:29:58] and you can't handle that you've got a
[1:30:00] real problem
[1:30:03] and we don't like that because we're men
[1:30:05] we're adults we're grown men and women
[1:30:07] right
[1:30:08] we don't like telling us what problems
[1:30:10] are
[1:30:12] it's your soul he's worried about he's
[1:30:15] not worried about
[1:30:16] he's not worried about your job yeah he
[1:30:18] wants you to do well
[1:30:19] he's not worried about the little things
[1:30:21] that you worry and fret over so much
[1:30:23] he's worried about getting your soul
[1:30:25] to heaven he's not just being a busybody
[1:30:30] and that's what we want to do a lot of
[1:30:31] times we want to say that this person is
[1:30:32] just a busybody
[1:30:34] but that's not the case god was
[1:30:37] personally involved with what was going
[1:30:39] on with joshua and his army
[1:30:42] i mean after all it is god's nation it's
[1:30:45] his church
[1:30:46] it's his people he's going to be
[1:30:48] intensely concerned about
[1:30:52] and we look at the story and it contains
[1:30:54] a clear
[1:30:55] illustration of sins
[1:30:58] leavening power
[1:31:02] until a correction was made
[1:31:06] the leaven it just didn't lie there and
[1:31:08] die
[1:31:10] you know it just increased and increased
[1:31:14] and increased now i don't understand all
[1:31:16] the bacon stuff
[1:31:17] and all how all this works but i know my
[1:31:19] wife she puts this in the bread and that
[1:31:21] and her bread and
[1:31:22] she'll wrap it up next thing you know
[1:31:23] she's wanting to see i think right he's
[1:31:25] going to raise
[1:31:25] the stuff right off off the pot
[1:31:28] because she stuck something in there
[1:31:31] that leavened that bread and made it
[1:31:33] rise up
[1:31:34] and brother sisters that's what happens
[1:31:36] in our life if we let these things come
[1:31:38] in there it don't just lay there
[1:31:40] jesus said a little leaven leaveneth the
[1:31:41] lump it don't just sit there and die
[1:31:45] the sin begins to grow
[1:31:48] and it begins to consume the area that
[1:31:51] it's in
[1:31:52] and it begins to fill that space bigger
[1:31:54] and bigger and bigger just a little
[1:31:58] living
[1:32:00] and brother branham said the minister
[1:32:02] has got a place of duty
[1:32:04] to stand and preach the riches of christ
[1:32:06] without
[1:32:07] compromising if he's called to be a
[1:32:11] preacher
[1:32:11] he shouldn't spare one thing for one
[1:32:13] person
[1:32:16] if he's called to be a preacher and as a
[1:32:18] member of the church he's called to be
[1:32:20] uh he's called to be a member of this
[1:32:22] certain group that he would not
[1:32:23] compromise
[1:32:25] and if the church believes that we
[1:32:26] should not gamble
[1:32:29] then you should never touch a deck of
[1:32:31] cards
[1:32:34] we don't like to hear these quotes
[1:32:38] it's where you where do you draw the
[1:32:40] line
[1:32:42] we we talk about a balanced life and yes
[1:32:44] christians and has to live a balanced
[1:32:46] life you can't go so far this way or so
[1:32:48] far
[1:32:48] that way but he said if we don't believe
[1:32:50] in gambling you should never touch a
[1:32:52] deck of cards
[1:32:54] if we don't believe in drinking you
[1:32:57] should turn your head completely
[1:32:59] from drinking
[1:33:05] some people in a message think it's okay
[1:33:06] to have social drinks
[1:33:12] they think it's okay
[1:33:19] i hope it ain't y'all y'all for quiet
[1:33:25] he should turn his head completely from
[1:33:28] drinking if we do not believe in
[1:33:29] gambling or smoking
[1:33:30] the member of the church should never
[1:33:31] touch such a thing
[1:33:34] god gives complete deliverance
[1:33:37] he will do it as if we completely
[1:33:39] surrender ourselves to him if we will
[1:33:40] completely deliver ourselves into his
[1:33:43] hand
[1:33:43] then god can live in us christ the hope
[1:33:46] of glory can reflect himself
[1:33:49] from us as we get ourselves out of the
[1:33:51] way
[1:33:52] then our thoughts are his thoughts
[1:33:56] and brother brown says can you imagine
[1:33:58] christ smoking a cigar
[1:34:01] and i'm seeing a guy walking down the
[1:34:03] road and i didn't even have this quote
[1:34:04] pulled up but i seen this guy
[1:34:05] walking down the road the other day and
[1:34:07] he had a cigar in his i don't even know
[1:34:09] how it was so big i don't know how he
[1:34:10] had it in his mouth
[1:34:12] and when i read this quote i thought
[1:34:15] i can put the two together now i can see
[1:34:19] i can't imagine christ walking down the
[1:34:21] road
[1:34:22] with a cigar
[1:34:25] so how could this guy possibly be
[1:34:28] portraying christ
[1:34:29] what would jesus do that's the theme for
[1:34:32] the last
[1:34:33] 25 30 years of my life everybody still
[1:34:35] talks about it it started out when i was
[1:34:37] a teenager wwjd
[1:34:39] what would jesus do
[1:34:42] i can't see jesus doing that and he says
[1:34:47] can you imagine smoking can you imagine
[1:34:49] christ drinking or playing cards
[1:34:53] it's even hard to imagine a picture in
[1:34:55] your mind
[1:34:57] of that it is so incomprehensible to me
[1:35:00] so why does why is it okay for
[1:35:02] people why is it okay for christians
[1:35:05] if he wouldn't do it why would we do it
[1:35:07] it's simple
[1:35:08] we the ones that make it hard he wants
[1:35:11] it upon your confession
[1:35:12] but you permit the devil to come in and
[1:35:14] take over
[1:35:16] and all the time in your heart listen to
[1:35:18] this all the time in your heart
[1:35:20] way down deep you know you're wrong when
[1:35:22] you do those things you might do it
[1:35:29] but deep down in your heart deep down
[1:35:32] inside like brother ben talked about you
[1:35:34] get that convicting power
[1:35:37] there's a convicting power that comes
[1:35:38] down and convicts you of the things that
[1:35:40] you're doing and you know as
[1:35:42] good as the day is long that what you're
[1:35:44] doing is not right before god
[1:35:48] aiken he knew what he was doing
[1:35:52] was not right before god
[1:35:57] we can't ignore the convicting power and
[1:36:00] i think that's where brother ben was
[1:36:01] trying to go
[1:36:02] we can't just can ignore when we know
[1:36:04] things are wrong to stand back
[1:36:06] and let it continue on and on and on and
[1:36:08] on if not
[1:36:10] if we do that we're going to find
[1:36:11] ourselves in a situation like aitkin was
[1:36:14] and now your whole family is affected
[1:36:15] the whole church is affected the whole
[1:36:17] bride is affected
[1:36:24] listen to this
[1:36:27] when one member would talk against
[1:36:30] another member
[1:36:31] he's still in the same quote here if one
[1:36:33] member would talk against another member
[1:36:36] you know that's wrong
[1:36:42] how often do we get caught in those
[1:36:43] conversations
[1:36:46] you know that's wrong
[1:36:49] if one member talks about another
[1:36:50] amendment you know that's wrong
[1:36:53] and if someone is down let's pick them
[1:36:56] up
[1:36:58] you're commanded to pray for one another
[1:37:00] not to talk against one another but to
[1:37:02] love one another and if someone is down
[1:37:04] let's pick them up help them up that's
[1:37:06] what makes us
[1:37:07] a unified group of believers
[1:37:14] marching in step marching in time
[1:37:17] as a group of believers not as an
[1:37:19] individual
[1:37:20] god's going to deal with you as an
[1:37:21] individual but you're marching in time
[1:37:23] we're helping each other we're a unified
[1:37:24] group of believers
[1:37:25] and he said when you don't obey that you
[1:37:27] don't but you don't
[1:37:29] believe obey god and you displease god
[1:37:34] when you don't obey that you don't obey
[1:37:36] god and you displease god
[1:37:39] therefore our church our people cannot
[1:37:42] prosper
[1:37:43] our church cannot go on because it's
[1:37:45] disunified
[1:37:47] it's not together a little eleven
[1:37:52] leavens the lump
[1:37:55] brothers sisters i think whenever we
[1:37:57] read scriptures
[1:37:59] and we read scriptures we're supposed to
[1:38:01] be able to learn from these scriptures
[1:38:02] we're supposed to be able to take these
[1:38:03] scriptures as warning signs as beacons
[1:38:06] and we look at these examples and it
[1:38:08] tells us don't live like this don't live
[1:38:10] like that don't do this
[1:38:11] and here we look at aiken and there's
[1:38:13] such an example set right here a lesson
[1:38:15] for the bride of christ
[1:38:17] on his background his behavior
[1:38:20] he acted unfaithfully
[1:38:25] to the devoted things of israel
[1:38:30] and the lord's anger burned against
[1:38:33] israel
[1:38:37] so who is this man that the lord's
[1:38:40] angers burned against israel so much who
[1:38:44] is this man that could cause god to look
[1:38:46] down upon his people
[1:38:47] and get angry
[1:38:57] the story i'm fixing to tell
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:00] and the words that come out of it are
[1:39:02] really food for thought
[1:39:04] because we ought to look at these words
[1:39:06] and it ought to be a reminder to us
[1:39:08] and that it ought to awaken us when we
[1:39:10] become sleepy
[1:39:11] when we become complacent when we become
[1:39:13] careless and we draw back and we find
[1:39:15] ourselves
[1:39:16] at the personal edge of destruction
[1:39:24] it angers god
[1:39:30] sometimes people think about aiken and
[1:39:33] they want to think and they look at him
[1:39:34] and they want to think about him being
[1:39:36] as a
[1:39:36] as a pagan this man is a bad man this
[1:39:40] man he he's just full of iniquity he's
[1:39:42] always on the lookout he's trying to
[1:39:43] grab
[1:39:44] property he wants to to gain easy money
[1:39:46] he's just a common thief
[1:39:49] and that's the way in our minds we begin
[1:39:50] to think about aiken but aiken was
[1:39:52] nothing of the sort of that
[1:39:55] aegin was one of the prominent families
[1:39:57] of the noble tribe of judah
[1:39:59] his father his grandfather his great
[1:40:01] grandfather carmy zimri zera
[1:40:03] they all lived a century in egypt under
[1:40:06] the taskmasters
[1:40:10] they were the ones that were there in
[1:40:11] egypt making bricks with no straw
[1:40:14] they were the ones that were the mud
[1:40:16] daubers brother sisters
[1:40:18] his own life had been spared when the
[1:40:20] egyptian soldiers
[1:40:22] sought to kill all the babies of
[1:40:25] israel it was aiken's life that was
[1:40:28] spared
[1:40:29] being the firstborn when when the death
[1:40:32] angel was going to pass through it was
[1:40:33] his
[1:40:34] own life that was spared
[1:40:42] his grandparents his parents his
[1:40:44] grandparents
[1:40:45] both of them saw the rise of moses they
[1:40:48] saw the rise of aaron
[1:40:50] they heard the miracles that the man
[1:40:53] done he was right there his parents
[1:40:55] witnessed the plagues
[1:40:56] as they come up on the egyptian
[1:40:58] taskmasters when the nile turned to
[1:40:59] blood
[1:41:00] and the frogs came and the gnats and the
[1:41:02] flies and the death of the livestock the
[1:41:04] bowls
[1:41:05] they were right there living this life
[1:41:10] he's not a pagan he's not a common thief
[1:41:14] his parents were right there they
[1:41:16] sacrificed a spotless lamb
[1:41:18] and sprinkled the blood upon the lentil
[1:41:20] of the doorpost
[1:41:21] and prepared a passover meal so that he
[1:41:24] could live
[1:41:25] it was his own people's obedience to the
[1:41:29] word
[1:41:30] that he's alive
[1:41:33] think about this
[1:41:36] aiken's father was right there and he
[1:41:40] experienced the deliverance through the
[1:41:41] opening of the red seas he saw the
[1:41:43] enemies he saw
[1:41:44] pharaoh and the chariots he saw them be
[1:41:46] swallowed up with the waves
[1:41:49] of water he experienced
[1:41:52] the quails falling from the sky to eat
[1:41:55] on
[1:41:56] he experienced the manna as
[1:41:59] it come down he experienced the water as
[1:42:01] it flowed from the rock
[1:42:03] and as he was a little boy he can
[1:42:04] remember the brazen serpent raised up on
[1:42:06] a pole
[1:42:07] and his family looked upon it
[1:42:10] and we're spared
[1:42:15] these are the stories that he lived this
[1:42:17] is the story of the life he lived he can
[1:42:19] remember hearing the stories about the
[1:42:21] pyramids
[1:42:22] and the mighty river and the fish and
[1:42:24] the abundance
[1:42:26] he remembers hearing the stories about
[1:42:28] the patriarch joseph
[1:42:30] and how joseph was thrown into the pit
[1:42:32] and how joseph come out
[1:42:34] and the patriarch was sold into slavery
[1:42:36] he heard those stories over and over and
[1:42:40] over
[1:42:42] so could we say this morning that aiken
[1:42:45] was raised in the message of the hour
[1:42:52] think about it don't let the story get
[1:42:55] so deep that you
[1:42:56] exclude yourself akin was right there
[1:43:00] he lived through the experiences
[1:43:03] brother sisters we have people around
[1:43:05] the message that's been raised
[1:43:06] we have kids that cut their teeth
[1:43:08] hearing the prophet
[1:43:11] in their bed at night in their little
[1:43:12] baby bed and they hear these stories
[1:43:14] over and over and over
[1:43:16] but where do they walk where do they
[1:43:22] walk
[1:43:26] aiken's just like the rest of us here's
[1:43:28] a young man he ended up he grew up
[1:43:31] raised up into the message we might say
[1:43:33] lived all the experiences he grew up and
[1:43:35] he fell in love and married one the
[1:43:36] daughter of the tribes and
[1:43:38] soon they had children that were born
[1:43:40] and he could see the rewards of god and
[1:43:43] their tent had to be expanded because
[1:43:45] more children were on the way he was
[1:43:46] really prospering
[1:43:48] and he became a man of substance a man
[1:43:52] may be a business successful and he
[1:43:54] labored six days a week and he had
[1:43:55] flocks and herds and oxen are you with
[1:43:58] me this is us
[1:43:58] this morning this is the world we live
[1:44:01] in
[1:44:02] this is the life we live message people
[1:44:06] born in a message raised in the message
[1:44:08] walk with the prophet was that the
[1:44:09] meetings
[1:44:11] god is prospered god is blessed god is
[1:44:14] give
[1:44:14] god give abundance and here he is
[1:44:18] the same person right here if we could
[1:44:21] say that he would have tractors and
[1:44:22] farms and
[1:44:23] marketable products he would have all
[1:44:25] this stuff
[1:44:32] constantly reminded of the life that he
[1:44:35] lived
[1:44:38] aiken sees his own personal triumph
[1:44:41] day after day as he obeyed god
[1:44:47] they entered into the land of canaan and
[1:44:49] they approached their first obstacle
[1:44:54] and as they come up to this first
[1:44:55] obstacle
[1:44:57] this land of a vast fortress named
[1:45:00] jericho
[1:45:02] they come up to this and they begin to
[1:45:03] look and they they have a strange plan
[1:45:06] that comes forth from god
[1:45:09] to joshua
[1:45:12] you're going to take this city
[1:45:16] once a day you're going to follow the
[1:45:18] ark of god and you're going to blow
[1:45:19] trumpets and you're going to walk around
[1:45:21] the city
[1:45:21] and you're going to repeat this for six
[1:45:23] consecutive days
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:29] god laying down the the plan here
[1:45:32] everybody's in agreeance they're
[1:45:33] marching they're walking they're moving
[1:45:35] forward
[1:45:35] and so again and again and again they go
[1:45:37] around and around and around but on that
[1:45:39] last day
[1:45:40] you're going to give a great shout and
[1:45:41] you're going to sound the trumpets and
[1:45:43] then the walls of jericho were going to
[1:45:45] come to the ground
[1:45:47] and that's exactly what they did they
[1:45:49] did what god said and the walls come
[1:45:51] down those evil people of that city
[1:45:53] were put to the sword by god command
[1:45:57] not anything that man done everybody in
[1:46:01] that city except for rahab and her
[1:46:03] family
[1:46:04] died by the sword
[1:46:08] and not a scratch on the children of
[1:46:10] israel
[1:46:12] not not one bit of harm not a not a
[1:46:15] bruise not a scratch not a drop of blood
[1:46:17] fell to the ground for the children of
[1:46:19] israel
[1:46:20] this was this was aiken this is who
[1:46:22] aegon was he was a man highly favored
[1:46:24] he knew god he he knew about the fall he
[1:46:27] knew about redemption he understood the
[1:46:29] bible
[1:46:30] he understood about the lamb the
[1:46:32] sprinkling of the blood this was the man
[1:46:33] aiken was
[1:46:37] brothers and sisters we can be around
[1:46:40] this message our whole life
[1:46:43] but if you don't know god
[1:46:47] i'm sorry
[1:46:51] knowing a prophet is not going to get
[1:46:53] you there
[1:46:54] you got to know the god the prophet you
[1:46:57] got to go
[1:46:58] know the god that raised the apostle
[1:47:03] we hear these stories and they encourage
[1:47:04] us we hear the stories of all these
[1:47:06] this was raised and that was raising the
[1:47:07] fish come to life in a possum
[1:47:09] and we hear all these stories and
[1:47:11] they're they're wonderful they're true
[1:47:12] they're they're true scripturally by the
[1:47:15] by the message of the hour they're true
[1:47:18] but do you know the god that made those
[1:47:21] things
[1:47:22] happen
[1:47:25] here's achin
[1:47:28] a sin of disobedience a sin of
[1:47:32] covetousness
[1:47:34] all the spoils of jericho
[1:47:38] were to be dedicated to the lord
[1:47:42] the rest was going to be burned with
[1:47:43] fire and they were going to take all the
[1:47:46] treasures the gold the silver and
[1:47:48] eventually they were going to build a
[1:47:49] big tabernacle
[1:47:51] to god
[1:47:55] because it was god's strategy that took
[1:47:58] down jericho
[1:47:59] man had no no business trying to take
[1:48:01] any credit any of the spoils any of the
[1:48:03] treasures because man had nothing to do
[1:48:05] with it
[1:48:06] they were just merely doing what god
[1:48:07] said so god's strategy
[1:48:09] was for me to take down this city and
[1:48:11] then we're going to build a temple
[1:48:12] someday
[1:48:13] and god alone was to be honored for this
[1:48:15] day
[1:48:17] god alone was the one to get the credit
[1:48:20] they were just the instruments of god's
[1:48:23] judgment on these people
[1:48:28] but watch aiken now aiken enters into
[1:48:32] the city
[1:48:33] of rumble of of rummage and
[1:48:36] and rubble laying around and he opens
[1:48:39] his eyes
[1:48:40] into the house he had entered and maybe
[1:48:42] he was just looking around and he opened
[1:48:44] up into a little cupboard
[1:48:45] in the in the in the living room there
[1:48:48] and in there he sees in there this
[1:48:50] beautiful babylonian robe
[1:48:54] and he sees this 200 shekels of silver
[1:48:57] and a wedge of gold
[1:49:00] 50 shekels that's about a pound and a
[1:49:03] quarter if i'd done my math right
[1:49:06] 32 000 worth in today's gold
[1:49:14] the story goes away it goes over thirty
[1:49:17] two thousand dollars
[1:49:18] in my mind i'm thinking hey it must have
[1:49:20] been millions
[1:49:22] no thirty two thousand dollars
[1:49:27] and he looks at these and he begins to
[1:49:29] covet these objects
[1:49:32] and he begins to take him and he takes
[1:49:34] them and he hides them away under his
[1:49:40] tent
[1:49:42] after god specifically told the people
[1:49:44] do not
[1:49:45] take any of the spoils
[1:49:52] has god ever specifically told us to do
[1:49:54] anything
[1:50:03] in my mind i'm thinking of this gold and
[1:50:04] silver is not worth much but back then
[1:50:06] it was probably the wages for a dozen
[1:50:08] shepherds for a year so it's a pretty
[1:50:10] good
[1:50:10] chunk of money that he's dealing with
[1:50:16] and he sees this beautiful robe
[1:50:19] from babylon and in his mind he's
[1:50:23] thinking man this is
[1:50:24] this is this is the most beautiful piece
[1:50:25] of garment i've ever seen
[1:50:28] this will be a real family treasure i
[1:50:30] want to i can take this and i can pass
[1:50:31] this down to generation after generation
[1:50:35] this is this is the kind of robe that
[1:50:37] jonathan wore
[1:50:38] this is the kind of road that david
[1:50:39] would have took over this is the kind of
[1:50:41] road that
[1:50:41] that we would go to weddings with and
[1:50:43] i'll go to a feast and i'll put on this
[1:50:45] robe
[1:50:46] it's so beautiful why would i let it go
[1:50:48] to waste
[1:50:52] a lot of times we think that way we
[1:50:53] think some of the things that god gives
[1:50:55] us
[1:50:56] that doesn't want us to have it's just
[1:50:57] waste why don't we just take it
[1:51:00] it don't work that way but here's this
[1:51:02] road maybe
[1:51:03] it's it's a robe that perhaps the oldest
[1:51:05] boy would be presented such a robe when
[1:51:07] he comes to age
[1:51:10] here's a road from from babylon the most
[1:51:12] famous
[1:51:13] styles and tailoring come out of the
[1:51:15] land of babylon
[1:51:17] they're known for their bright dyes and
[1:51:19] their beautiful fabric
[1:51:22] those things are hard to not grab a hold
[1:51:25] of
[1:51:26] josephus the jewish historian says that
[1:51:28] the garment that aiken took was a royal
[1:51:30] robe woven entirely of
[1:51:32] gold he'd never seen nothing like that
[1:51:37] and sometimes our eyes gravitate to
[1:51:40] things that god
[1:51:40] really don't want us to be involved with
[1:51:43] but because it's beautiful because it
[1:51:45] looks like pleasure because it's things
[1:51:47] that look fun
[1:51:48] and enticing to us we get in and we
[1:51:50] begin to take these things
[1:51:51] and we pull them into the hidden place
[1:51:53] of our heart
[1:51:59] think about this gown this rope
[1:52:04] you know people pay outrageous amounts
[1:52:06] of money
[1:52:08] for robes or gowns or jerseys of
[1:52:11] athletes of movie stars
[1:52:13] millions and millions of dollars because
[1:52:15] somebody wore it
[1:52:19] and here's aiken through dishonesty
[1:52:25] and dishonorably gained the gold
[1:52:28] the silver and the garment
[1:52:33] and paul calls it idolatry
[1:52:39] it sounds simple it sounds easy it
[1:52:42] sounds like something that we wouldn't
[1:52:43] get
[1:52:44] involved with but brother and sister
[1:52:45] your secret sins control your life
[1:52:50] and this is where it gets serious
[1:52:51] because your secret sins if you're not
[1:52:53] careful
[1:52:54] they will take over everything going on
[1:52:57] in your life you'll begin to get
[1:52:58] consumed with things that you know like
[1:53:01] we said
[1:53:01] you shouldn't be doing
[1:53:08] aiken hid it under the tent under the
[1:53:10] floor in his tent
[1:53:13] and no doubt he was sitting there many
[1:53:14] times when he would close
[1:53:16] the door on his tent in his secret place
[1:53:21] and light up his little lamp he would
[1:53:22] pull out his gold
[1:53:24] and his silver and he's weighing it in
[1:53:27] his hand look at this man i
[1:53:29] i'm rich why would god not want us to
[1:53:32] have this
[1:53:34] why would god not want us to be
[1:53:36] prosperous look at this rope let me just
[1:53:38] feel the fabric of it it's beautiful
[1:53:40] why would god not want us to have this
[1:53:43] and he's weighing the stuff and he's
[1:53:45] looking at it over and over and over and
[1:53:47] he thinks man this is so glorious this
[1:53:48] is wonderful i'm living the life
[1:53:53] that's what secret sin does for you you
[1:53:56] think you're living the life
[1:54:01] we're going to have to get where the
[1:54:02] rubber meets the road
[1:54:05] i read story
[1:54:08] about men who get consumed in
[1:54:10] pornography
[1:54:15] yeah i can hear crickets now
[1:54:19] and it's a secret sin in their life
[1:54:22] and they begin to get so consumed by
[1:54:24] this secret sin
[1:54:25] in their life that that's all their
[1:54:27] focus and all their intent
[1:54:29] they lose their jobs because of watching
[1:54:32] a video
[1:54:36] begin to get so consumed in their life
[1:54:38] with this
[1:54:39] with this event but it's going on it
[1:54:40] starts out maybe just a clip
[1:54:43] just maybe starts out just so five
[1:54:45] minutes here
[1:54:46] 10 minutes there an hour here
[1:54:49] three hours there then you're dis
[1:54:52] disconnected from your family you're
[1:54:54] walking out of tune
[1:54:57] and the next thing you know this begins
[1:54:59] to consume their lives into such a place
[1:55:02] that they have no
[1:55:02] control over their lives
[1:55:09] maybe it's money
[1:55:13] people allow money to consume their
[1:55:16] lives
[1:55:18] a dollar is not enough
[1:55:22] two dollars is not enough
[1:55:26] a hundred thousand dollars is not enough
[1:55:29] and they begin to get consumed over and
[1:55:31] over and over and god's probably
[1:55:32] wondering why don't you show me the kind
[1:55:34] of attention you're showing to this
[1:55:36] filthy pornography this filthy money
[1:55:39] this filthy greed these filthy desires
[1:55:42] why don't you show me that kind of
[1:55:43] attention i don't want to be
[1:55:45] disrespected
[1:55:47] i'm first in your life
[1:55:53] brother i don't like this kind of
[1:55:55] preaching
[1:55:57] but it's the truth you get you get
[1:56:00] consumed with these secret sins
[1:56:02] you know somebody might see you out do
[1:56:04] something you may say something slight
[1:56:06] off the word sometime and somebody think
[1:56:07] oh he's gonna said that or
[1:56:09] he shouldn't have done that but i'm not
[1:56:10] talking about those kinds of things
[1:56:13] i'm talking about the things that you
[1:56:14] put into your tent i'm talking about the
[1:56:16] things you hide underneath the floor of
[1:56:18] your tent
[1:56:19] that's where your treasure's at
[1:56:30] what pain and poverty
[1:56:34] these things cause families
[1:56:38] what hurt it places on the children in
[1:56:40] families
[1:56:41] the distress the children's goes through
[1:56:43] the loneliness the abandonment
[1:56:49] coveting items coveting is what makes a
[1:56:54] man
[1:56:55] stalk a woman at his place of business
[1:56:59] coveting is what causes a man to go
[1:57:01] after a woman that's not his
[1:57:02] and ruin their family
[1:57:07] coveting secret sins
[1:57:11] nobody knows nobody saw me
[1:57:15] there's no witnesses i've got the gold
[1:57:19] i've got the silver i got the garment
[1:57:21] tuck it away
[1:57:27] if you're coveting for or itching for
[1:57:30] riches and money and popularity
[1:57:32] possession success fame esteem
[1:57:37] glory
[1:57:40] that kind of covetousness is gonna lead
[1:57:43] your heart to a dream world
[1:57:45] because it don't exist it's for a season
[1:57:51] people would take years
[1:57:54] years they would spend building up a
[1:57:56] home a marriage a life
[1:57:58] kids and give it all
[1:58:01] for 15 minutes
[1:58:10] don't place any gold or treasury of
[1:58:14] yourself but put it in the lord's house
[1:58:17] don't take it leave it
[1:58:20] why is it so hard somebody tells you to
[1:58:22] do something like that god says leave it
[1:58:24] why was it so hard it wasn't a hard
[1:58:26] commandment
[1:58:29] what do you think aiken was thinking
[1:58:30] about
[1:58:32] the days after the fall of jericho
[1:58:36] you know there was there was a time they
[1:58:37] didn't just leave jericho and go
[1:58:39] straight to ie and go take it and try to
[1:58:40] take it over
[1:58:42] but there was days that went by do you
[1:58:45] think he's sitting there anything man
[1:58:46] what
[1:58:47] what miraculous event took place that we
[1:58:50] would walk around
[1:58:51] the city blowing horns and shouting
[1:58:56] and the walls would come crumbling down
[1:58:58] walls the chariots drove around
[1:59:01] walls that they would hold cherry hey
[1:59:03] can you imagine god is so glorious do
[1:59:05] you think that's what he's saying no he
[1:59:07] was tucking away
[1:59:08] enjoying his little secret sin
[1:59:13] what a pathetic little man he became
[1:59:18] his greed his defiance diminished him
[1:59:22] no longer was he moral moral
[1:59:25] leader he had no more leadership ability
[1:59:29] ability about him he was not a leader in
[1:59:30] his family
[1:59:32] but he was consumed with things that
[1:59:34] would
[1:59:36] diminish away
[1:59:41] let's look at what happened next with
[1:59:44] the soldiers of god
[1:59:45] we know where aiken was we know what
[1:59:47] he'd done nobody's seen him we know
[1:59:48] where he's at now the
[1:59:50] the the stuff is in the tent the the
[1:59:52] articles are in the tent he's hitting
[1:59:54] them away
[1:59:55] and now their next path is to go to ie
[1:59:59] and joshua being the the the soldier he
[2:00:02] was he didn't presume
[2:00:03] anything so in joshua's mind he said i'm
[2:00:06] gonna send some scouts out to go see
[2:00:08] what kind of city this place is before
[2:00:09] we take it over
[2:00:11] and he sends the guys over the spies to
[2:00:14] go scout it out
[2:00:15] and they come back and they say joshua
[2:00:16] there is nothing near
[2:00:18] like jericho there
[2:00:21] they don't have any kind of the fortress
[2:00:23] that jericho's got this is going to be a
[2:00:25] cakewalk joshua
[2:00:27] we don't need half a million we don't we
[2:00:28] just just send a few thousand men
[2:00:31] and we will take this city over so
[2:00:34] joshua then begins to send about 3
[2:00:36] 000 men and to the shocking of
[2:00:38] those men
[2:00:40] now they're tucking tail they're running
[2:00:42] as fast as they can from this little
[2:00:44] city that should cause no threat to them
[2:00:47] and now they look behind
[2:00:48] and there's 36 men of their fallen
[2:00:51] friends and family
[2:00:53] behind them
[2:00:57] 36 men that died innocently
[2:01:02] because aiken has one little sin in his
[2:01:06] life
[2:01:11] 36 men dead on a battlefield their
[2:01:14] morale began to
[2:01:16] disappear from israel their hearts
[2:01:20] melted
[2:01:22] they fell down joshua took rent his
[2:01:24] clothes and fell down face first onto
[2:01:26] the ground as to say god what have i
[2:01:28] done
[2:01:28] what am i going to do he remained there
[2:01:30] until the evening
[2:01:34] what a surprise god had become angry
[2:01:37] with the people
[2:01:38] and he left them to their own demise
[2:01:41] and god's teaching them a lesson that
[2:01:43] christ's people
[2:01:45] need to be taught today and that is
[2:01:46] without god we can do nothing
[2:01:53] but if you take things into your own
[2:01:55] hands
[2:01:58] and you become a secret sinner
[2:02:01] and i hate to say that word over and
[2:02:03] over
[2:02:05] but i'm afraid there's times that we
[2:02:06] have to look at that and we have to
[2:02:07] really examine ourselves i need to
[2:02:09] examine myself
[2:02:11] examine my life my wife needs to examine
[2:02:13] herself my kids need to examine
[2:02:15] themselves
[2:02:15] and say what kind of life are we living
[2:02:19] and i encourage you to do the same thing
[2:02:22] don't play with it
[2:02:25] don't play with it but take it serious
[2:02:27] because we don't want to be like aiken
[2:02:29] who looted the school and brought it in
[2:02:31] there and god couldn't do nothing with
[2:02:33] him
[2:02:33] and this little sin ruined the whole
[2:02:36] nation
[2:02:39] 36 men killed 36 families destroyed
[2:02:42] parents
[2:02:42] wives people defeated crippled the
[2:02:46] reputation of the children of
[2:02:47] israel for the next 800 years
[2:02:54] aiken is the one who made the lord's
[2:02:58] enemies bold achin is the one who
[2:03:02] strengthened
[2:03:04] the enemies of god aiken is the one
[2:03:07] who brought hardship upon
[2:03:20] aiken has little sin
[2:03:26] they begin to consume his life
[2:03:32] brothers and sisters i just want to
[2:03:38] take just a solemn moment we're fixing
[2:03:41] to observe
[2:03:42] the lord's supper the communion today
[2:03:46] the bread the body of christ that was
[2:03:49] broken
[2:03:51] bruised beaten
[2:03:55] the wine the fruit of the vine
[2:03:57] representing the blood that was shed
[2:04:00] down calvary and as i hear and think
[2:04:03] about this story of aitkin and i want to
[2:04:05] transition it over now
[2:04:07] and i want to just ask each one of us as
[2:04:10] individuals
[2:04:12] the communion is not something we take
[2:04:14] lightly
[2:04:15] the communion is not something that you
[2:04:17] play with
[2:04:19] the communion is a sincere and dedicated
[2:04:21] time of your life when you have to
[2:04:22] examine your life
[2:04:25] and you have to be able to look and you
[2:04:26] look through the eyes and say do i have
[2:04:28] anything that i have pulled away and
[2:04:30] tucked away have i done anything
[2:04:32] wrong have i done anybody wrong am i
[2:04:34] being the moral christian that i should
[2:04:36] be
[2:04:38] but i'm when i take this i'm
[2:04:39] representing what god done for me
[2:04:46] so if we could this morning i just want
[2:04:48] to quietly bow our heads maybe sister
[2:04:50] becky if you would like to come to the
[2:04:52] piano
[2:04:53] and we'll just transition to brother
[2:04:55] byler in just a few minutes
[2:04:57] over into the communion service and let
[2:04:59] him take over the communion
[2:05:01] but as we said here this morning if we
[2:05:03] could just all bow our heads and
[2:05:04] honestly
[2:05:05] and sincerely just you and you alone as
[2:05:09] we get ready to take this communion
[2:05:11] and we think about this story that we've
[2:05:13] heard of with aiken
[2:05:19] i'm asking myself this morning
[2:05:23] maybe you just play
[2:05:26] he was bruised or something be fine
[2:05:28] [Music]
[2:05:32] and i'm looking at i'm asking myself
[2:05:35] this morning
[2:05:37] is there anything in my life that would
[2:05:40] bring a weakness
[2:05:42] to this congregation
[2:05:46] this is our church body as individuals
[2:05:50] we can go before god
[2:05:52] continuously day after day after day
[2:05:55] as long as there's mercy on the seat and
[2:05:58] we can ask for forgiveness and he's just
[2:06:00] and he's
[2:06:01] he's free to give he promises he would
[2:06:02] do that for his people
[2:06:05] but i'm asking this morning and myself
[2:06:07] is there anything that would bring
[2:06:08] weakness upon this congregation
