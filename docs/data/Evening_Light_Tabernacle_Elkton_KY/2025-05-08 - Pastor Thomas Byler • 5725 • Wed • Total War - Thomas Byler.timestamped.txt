[22:46] and uh I don't know what's wrong with me
[22:49] other than being lazy. That's all I'll

[36:57] A man just teaching or just preaching,
[36:59] it's it's good and it's edifying, but

[37:02] about when that spirit just comes in a
[37:04] special way. Amen. And so, that we

[38:18] Amen. That might as well be in a
[38:20] revival. Amen. Amen. We in a revival.
[38:23] So, praise the Lord. Amen. God is good.
[38:26] Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[38:29] Kind heavenly father, we come before
[38:30] you, Lord Jesus. Once again, thankful,
[38:32] Lord, to be able to assemble ourselves
[38:33] together, Lord. Father, our country, our
[38:37] nation, our laws are still letting us do
[38:40] this. And we appreciate that, Father,
[38:42] for we know there was a time when
[38:44] Christians like us, if we did something
[38:46] like that, like something like this,
[38:49] that we'd be drugged out and we'd be
[38:51] killed and imprisoned and all these
[38:54] things, Lord. And there may come a time
[38:56] for that again, Lord Jesus. But we do
[38:59] appreciate the freedom that we have to
[39:01] be able to assemble ourselves together
[39:03] and to do what we love to do, Father.
[39:05] And that's to come together to give you
[39:07] the honor and glory and praise to
[39:09] worship you, Lord Jesus, with the songs
[39:11] that we sing. And then, Father, to open
[39:13] our hearts, Lord Jesus, that you'll come
[39:15] and speak to our hearts, Father, the
[39:17] word of life, Lord Jesus, that we can
[39:19] call from here a change people, a better
[39:21] people than what we've come. Lord, we
[39:24] ask God that this this little thought
[39:26] that I feel Lord, you've laid upon my
[39:28] heart to minister, we just ask God that
[39:30] you'll just help me to get out of the
[39:31] way and even as it was prayed earlier
[39:34] that we just get out of the way and let
[39:36] you have your way tonight. Father, we
[39:38] thank you, Lord, for every believer that
[39:40] loves you. Everybody that comes to
[39:42] church and loves you and and listens to
[39:44] the word and those who can't come that
[39:45] stream. Lord, we ask God blessing upon
[39:48] them. But we ask God that you'll just
[39:50] have your way now in this service in
[39:51] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Amen. We do
[39:55] want to have Amen. uh a u special prayer
[40:01] for the Fox family and Tracy. Amen. At
[40:04] the end, it just takes some time for all
[40:07] us to pray for them. Amen. How many
[40:10] believe they need it? Amen. And may may
[40:13] may the
[40:15] strength, amen, that comes only from the
[40:18] Lord. May they feel that. Amen. Because
[40:20] I believe God hears his children's
[40:23] prayer and it makes a difference. Amen.
[40:26] But uh anyway, so if you will turn your
[40:28] Bibles, Amen. this
[40:30] evening. Amen. And if you have my title
[40:34] up there, Amen. I want to speak on
[40:38] uh a title called Total War. Total war.
[40:44] Amen. Very different title, but I've
[40:46] only heard it a few times, but Amen.
[40:49] We'll get into it and kind of Amen. just
[40:53] uh try to express ourselves if we can.
[40:56] Okay. And uh where did what did I tell
[40:59] you to go?
[41:01] All right. Let's go to book of Daniel.
[41:04] Daniel. Amen. Book of Daniel, the third
[41:07] chapter. Amen. Praise the
[41:14] Lord. They have Devon and Jana on a
[41:16] Wednesday night. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[41:20] Amen. Hope y'all are enjoying it up on
[41:22] that hill so far. Amen. One of these
[41:25] days you'll have a big old house maybe
[41:26] somewhere. Amen. It'll
[41:29] grow. Gotta have dreams, right? Praise
[41:33] the Lord. Daniel
[41:35] 3. Little bit of
[41:37] reading. Amen. Only because I love this
[41:40] story so much, I decided not just to
[41:41] give a little scripture, but I decided
[41:43] to read it. Amen. In Daniel 3, and we'll
[41:46] begin with verse 16. Shadrach, Meshach,
[41:50] and Abidne answered and said to the
[41:52] king, this is chapter 3,
[41:55] 16, answered the king, oh
[41:57] Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
[41:59] answer thee in this matter. If it be so,
[42:02] our God whom we serve is able to deliver
[42:04] us from the burning fiery furnace, and
[42:07] he will deliver us out of thy hand, O
[42:10] king. But if not, be it known unto thee,
[42:12] O king, that we will not serve thy God,
[42:16] nor worship the golden image which thou
[42:18] hast
[42:20] made. Amen. Now, we know heated the
[42:23] furnace seven times hotter. Ain't that
[42:25] right? And verse 21 says, "Then these
[42:28] men were bound in their coats and their
[42:30] hos and their
[42:31] hats." It sounds like they were pretty
[42:33] much wrapped up, don't you? I mean,
[42:36] bound up in their clothes, everything.
[42:38] And were cast into the midst of the
[42:40] burning fiery furnace. Therefore,
[42:42] because the king's commandment was so
[42:44] urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot,
[42:46] the flame of the fire slew those men
[42:49] that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and
[42:51] Abednego. And these three men, Shadrach,
[42:54] Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound
[42:56] into the midst of the burning fiery
[42:58] furnace. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king
[43:00] was
[43:03] astonished, and rose up in haste, and
[43:06] spake, and said unto his counselors,
[43:08] "Did we not cast three men bound into
[43:10] this midst of the
[43:12] fire?" They answered, and said unto the
[43:15] king, "True, O king." And he answered
[43:17] and said, "Lo, I see four men loose
[43:20] walking in the midst of the fire, and
[43:22] they have no hurt. And the form of the
[43:25] fourth man is like unto the son of God."
[43:28] And Neb then Then Nebuchadnezzar came
[43:30] near to the mouth of the burning fiery
[43:31] furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach,
[43:33] Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of
[43:35] the most high
[43:37] God and come hither. Then Shadrach,
[43:39] Meshach, and Abednego came forth out of
[43:42] the fire. And the princes and the
[43:44] governors, the captives, the captives
[43:45] counselors being gathered together saw
[43:48] these men put whose uh upon whose bodies
[43:51] the fire had no
[43:53] power, nor was an hair of their head
[43:56] singed. Neither were their coats
[43:59] changed, nor the smell of smoke, so to
[44:01] speak, fire had passed on them. Then
[44:04] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, "Blessed
[44:06] be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
[44:08] Abednego, who has sent his angel and
[44:10] delivered his servants that trusted in
[44:13] him, have changed the king's word, and
[44:15] yielded their bodies that they might
[44:17] listen to that that word and yielded
[44:21] their bodies." Amen. Remember over in
[44:24] the New Testament he said uh he said uh
[44:27] uh Paul said that you present your
[44:29] bodies a living sacrifice holy and
[44:31] acceptable unto God which is your
[44:33] reasonable service. Ain't that right?
[44:36] Amen. So we are to yield ourselves to
[44:39] God also. Ain't that right? That they
[44:41] might not serve nor worship any god
[44:43] except their own god. Therefore, I make
[44:46] a decree that every people, nation,
[44:48] language which speak anything a miss
[44:50] against the God of Shadrach,
[44:52] Meso shall be cut to pieces, and their
[44:55] houses shall be made because there is no
[44:58] other god great that can deliver after
[45:02] this
[45:03] sword. How many believes that tonight?
[45:05] We've got a God that can deliver like
[45:08] nobody else.
[45:10] Amen. Then the king promoted Shadrach,
[45:13] Meshach, and Abednego in the province of
[45:15] Babylon. May God add his blessings to
[45:17] the reading of the word, you can be
[45:19] seated. Amen. As we think about total
[45:22] war, Amen. I guess I heard this phrase
[45:25] somewhere uh I heard this phrase. Amen.
[45:29] That came out of World War World War II.
[45:33] And I believe the Germans made it. The
[45:36] Germans, I believe, made that statement.
[45:38] I heard him make that statement one
[45:40] time. Amen. One of their spokesmans up
[45:42] there because guess
[45:44] what? They had they had all of the
[45:47] allies coming after them. Ain't that
[45:49] right? And they realized that, hey,
[45:51] guess what? We're going to have to think
[45:53] of this as total war. Complete war.
[45:57] Amen. So, I looked up and I I asked Siri
[46:00] to pull up what this uh where this uh
[46:03] total war phrase comes from and what it
[46:05] really means. The phrase total war
[46:07] seemingly originated amongst French
[46:10] writers during World War I. Amen. Uh f
[46:15] the French writer Leon Doet
[46:18] uh published a collection of essays
[46:20] called the total war. Amen. Like a world
[46:25] war, complete
[46:27] war.
[46:29] Amen. Amen.
[46:31] And uh in 18 in 1918, the phrase was
[46:36] popularized by the 1935 publication of a
[46:39] German general general Eric
[46:43] Ludenolf World War II memoir. He says at
[46:47] the total war. Amen. Amen. And I thought
[46:51] about that total war.
[46:54] I thought about what the prophet of God
[46:56] said, how that we're now uh the the
[47:00] greatest battle that was ever fought is
[47:03] just beginning is going is is going on.
[47:06] Amen. In that message called the
[47:08] greatest battle that was ever fought.
[47:10] And I thought, you know, that's the way
[47:12] that a believer, a Christian, that's
[47:13] what we're going to have to do. We're
[47:16] going to have to go to total war.
[47:20] Amen.
[47:21] In other words, go into uh the area
[47:24] that's supposedly ours, the property
[47:27] that is ours, and take back, Amen.
[47:31] everything that the devil perhaps has
[47:33] taken from us. We are not going to uh
[47:36] and ex to accept a conditional
[47:39] surrender.
[47:42] Isn't that what uh Moses tried, Pharaoh
[47:44] tried to do with Moses? And he says,
[47:46] "Well, just take some of your men and
[47:48] women and whatever and go off for a
[47:49] while, but then come back or and leave
[47:51] this and leave that."
[47:54] Amen. But he said, "No, we're not going
[47:56] to leave one hoof behind. We're not
[47:58] going to leave one thing behind."
[48:03] Amen.
[48:04] How many believe that we're in the final
[48:06] war?
[48:08] You and I are in the final war.
[48:11] We are the final soldiers of God in the
[48:15] final war.
[48:18] You might not think much of yourself,
[48:20] but God thinks quite a bit of you. Why?
[48:23] Because he had you born in this
[48:26] generation. He called you
[48:29] specifically. Amen.
[48:31] Personally, how many believe that to be
[48:34] a real child of God, you have to have a
[48:36] personal call from God. God has to
[48:38] personally call you. They had to
[48:40] personally save you, bring you into this
[48:44] army of God.
[48:49] Amen. The other thing that it says that
[48:52] it means total war is a type of warfare
[48:54] that
[48:55] includes any and all
[48:58] resources. Amen. I like that. Amen. in
[49:01] the war you uh includes any and all
[49:07] resources and
[49:09] infrastructure. Now, this says as
[49:11] legitimate military
[49:14] targets. Amen. So, you know, that's a
[49:17] little bit of what we did in World War
[49:19] II. We, you know, we did a little bit of
[49:21] that civilian
[49:24] bombing. How many knows we burnt cities,
[49:27] man? We had one one night 40,000 we
[49:31] would kill in one night. It was pretty
[49:33] devastating. It was bad cuz we realized
[49:36] that we're going to have to break these
[49:37] Germans. We're going to have to break
[49:39] them. And it was tough to
[49:42] break. Amen. Because they were out for
[49:46] total war. They were out. Amen.
[49:50] I thought I thought, you know, I've seen
[49:52] quite a bit of that. And I'll just put
[49:53] this in here because they thought that
[49:55] they were supreme. They were better than
[49:59] anybody else. And the Russians were
[50:02] undermentioned. Undermentioned under
[50:04] under people. Underhumans. Subhumans, I
[50:07] believe it's called. They were
[50:10] subhumans. You know, after brother
[50:13] brother Glenn, after we defeated them,
[50:16] you could have rubbed it in a little
[50:17] bit, couldn't you? They say, "Okay, now
[50:19] who is the subhuman?
[50:22] You aggravate you a little bit, right?"
[50:25] Amen. The subhumans whooped y'all. What
[50:27] does that put you? Where does that put
[50:29] you?
[50:31] Way down there
[50:33] somewhere. Amen. But anyway, we'll leave
[50:37] that alone. But I thought about that.
[50:39] And the other part is it says that Amen.
[50:42] It mobilizes all of its resources of
[50:46] society to fight the war and gives
[50:50] priority to warfare over
[50:53] non-combatant needs. Amen. I mean, he
[50:58] believes even Jesus said, he said,
[51:01] "Don't worry about your food or your
[51:03] clothes or what you shall wear." Ain't
[51:06] that right? He says, "God knows that you
[51:08] have need of these things, but seek ye
[51:10] first the kingdom of God. And all these
[51:13] things will be added unto you." In other
[51:15] words, all of our natural things, that's
[51:17] all secondary.
[51:20] The first thing is is to have God in
[51:23] your heart.
[51:25] The first God is first.
[51:32] Amen. I wrote down here in order. In
[51:35] other words, you you got to go all out.
[51:41] Amen.
[51:42] To be all to be all in. You got to be
[51:45] all out. You got to go all out if you
[51:47] want to be all in.
[51:50] Even Jesus I mean even Jesus said,
[51:52] "Unless you're willing to forsake all to
[51:54] follow me, you're not worthy of me."
[52:02] Amen. Amen. This tonight's service
[52:04] really is focused towards Christians
[52:07] that are Christians like yourselves,
[52:10] seasoned
[52:11] Christians. I want to talk to seasoned
[52:14] Christians tonight. Would that be okay?
[52:17] I want to talk to about how that you can
[52:19] go a little higher,
[52:22] go a little deeper. Isn't that right?
[52:26] I'll use a lot of quotes that I'm
[52:27] familiar with that I just basically
[52:29] wrote down there new revelation on.
[52:32] Amen. But completely,
[52:34] totally. Amen. Paul, what did Paul say
[52:36] about it? Paul said, "I have I have uh
[52:41] suffered the loss of all things that I
[52:43] may win Christ." When Paul went in, he
[52:47] went all in.
[52:50] You cannot be a real Christian unless
[52:53] you are all in.
[52:57] 100%.
[53:02] We're living in the hour of climax.
[53:05] Isn't that right? We're in the final
[53:10] stage, the final lap, so to speak. How
[53:14] many knows in that final lap, in that
[53:16] last 10 yards, so to speak, what do they
[53:19] do? They give it all they got.
[53:24] And that's what you all got to do.
[53:26] That's what I got to do.
[53:29] Evening Light Tabernacle. That's where
[53:31] we've come to. We've come to the place,
[53:34] amen, that we're moving forward. But
[53:35] we're going to have to give it all that
[53:37] we got.
[53:41] If we're going to be triumphant and if
[53:43] we're going to make that rapture,
[53:48] Amen. I want to tell you something that
[53:50] those tapes and those messages, the word
[53:52] off of those books, it's going to have
[53:55] to come off the books and into our
[53:57] hearts. That's where it's got to come
[53:59] to. Nothing less than that is going to
[54:02] take us in the rapture. It's time for us
[54:04] to have a complete and total
[54:06] deliverance.
[54:08] It's time for us to come to the place
[54:10] where we separate ourselves total a
[54:13] total separation from unbelief. How many
[54:16] know the biggest enemy that you and I
[54:18] have is doubt. The biggest devil there
[54:21] is a devil of unbelief because that
[54:23] stops you from getting saved. It stops
[54:25] up everything from the blessings of God.
[54:28] But faith, if thou can't believe, all
[54:31] things are possible. So if you can
[54:33] believe tonight, there's nothing that is
[54:36] impossible. Brother Andrew Glover
[54:38] preached on that. Believing that all
[54:40] things are possible, there's more power
[54:42] for you.
[54:46] [Music]
[54:47] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[54:57] Amen. God's doing something in in the
[55:00] church here.
[55:03] Move going on. Amen. Notice a lot of our
[55:07] young men and different ones, they're
[55:08] coming to church and they're all dressed
[55:10] up in suits.
[55:16] Praise the Lord. People's dressing
[55:17] nicer.
[55:20] I had to think, you know, what's what's
[55:21] this all about? Even I'm trying to dress
[55:23] a little nicer. I dress I dress
[55:27] green. My wife does a good job, right?
[55:30] And I said, "Honey, you know, it's
[55:32] green. Doesn't that have something with
[55:34] St. Patrick's Day or something?" You
[55:35] know, she said, "Don't worry about all
[55:40] that." But I thought, you know, I
[55:42] thought that's good. It's a good thing
[55:47] if I come and you invited me to your
[55:49] house, I wouldn't come in my dirty work
[55:52] clothes, would I? No. If I went to visit
[55:55] you each other, we'd kind of dress our
[55:57] better clothes. Ain't that right?
[56:01] Sure we would. What about coming to the
[56:04] Lord's house?
[56:06] Coming to see the Lord, we want to
[56:08] present ourselves and be decent.
[56:11] That's right.
[56:13] Amen. Now, we've had several come to
[56:17] church not so long ago, and I don't want
[56:19] to mention names, but you'll know who
[56:20] I'm They'll know who I'm talking about.
[56:22] Come to church. Amen. And working and
[56:24] come with dirty
[56:29] clothes. And you know, I wanted to go
[56:31] up. I think I think might might have
[56:33] been might I won't mention, but I wanted
[56:35] to go and shake their hand. I said
[56:37] because guess what? Just if you are
[56:39] working somewhere, that's all you got.
[56:40] Well, praise God. Come to church anyway.
[56:43] We don't want you to miss church.
[56:47] Amen. Praise the Lord. Most of them say,
[56:49] "Well, I ain't dressed. I ain't ready.
[56:51] I'll go. Just listen to the devil if you
[56:53] want to." Amen. I don't care if you're
[56:55] all greasy. Just try to get you a chair
[56:57] out there somewhere where you don't get
[56:59] our nice pews all
[57:01] dirty. We'll fix you up somewhere.
[57:05] Amen. But but come to church. come
[57:07] expecting.
[57:09] Amen. I thought that's all right. Praise
[57:11] the Lord.
[57:14] Amen. God's moving.
[57:18] When preachers come here, every one of
[57:20] them say, "It's so easy to preach to
[57:22] your group. So easy to preach."
[57:25] Woo. This is off the page trip. But you
[57:28] know, I thought that's right. We're not
[57:30] fussing and fighting and bickering and
[57:32] complaining about everything. Because if
[57:34] you add that to brother Bam said the
[57:36] Holy Spirit would be gone. You can't
[57:38] have any revival under that kind of
[57:40] conditions hopefully. Amen. We're mature
[57:43] enough. How many know this is the age of
[57:44] maturity?
[57:46] This is the hour of absolute total.
[57:50] Amen. A complete maturity for people.
[57:54] We're not babies anymore. We're not
[57:56] children anymore. We're not tossed about
[57:58] anymore.
[58:00] We've come through trials. We've come
[58:01] through testings. We've come through
[58:03] molding places. We've come Amen. And I'm
[58:06] here to tell
[58:07] you, Amen. You want to get stronger. How
[58:10] many wants to get stronger? But guess
[58:12] what? If you're going to fly higher,
[58:14] what does it take? Sometimes it takes
[58:16] wind to push you higher. You realize how
[58:20] much of a push this church got. When my
[58:22] my wife was diagnosed with that cancer,
[58:24] I'm telling you what it did. It didn't
[58:26] take us down. It pushed us greater up
[58:28] there. When the wind blows, we set
[58:30] ourselves in
[58:37] Christ. Our worship went up. Our
[58:39] expectation, our unity went up.
[58:43] Why? Because of the wind. I love it.
[58:44] I've even preached a message on it
[58:46] before. Amen. But everything the devil
[58:48] throws at you. Amen. It works. It's
[58:50] counterproductive to the devil. The more
[58:53] he does that, the stronger he makes us.
[58:57] And God allows him to do stuff to make
[58:59] us stronger.
[59:05] Amen. Praise the Lord. We don't like it.
[59:08] Don't feel good.
[59:10] But that's the only way you get it. The
[59:13] only way Amen. Completion, the only way
[59:15] character comes is through
[59:18] suffering. God never promised us a
[59:21] flowery bene. How many knows it's not
[59:24] just about running the aisles and
[59:26] shouting and screaming and having a good
[59:28] time in church? No, it's about the
[59:30] trials and the tribulations and the
[59:32] hardships that we go through. Amen. And
[59:34] a Christian can show his gratitude and
[59:37] his love to God by conducting himself
[59:40] with joy amidst the trials that God
[59:42] allows to come his way.
[59:46] That's a direct quote. Amen. Praise the
[59:49] Lord. Hallelujah.
[59:53] Amen. Total
[59:55] war. Amen. Will not leave one hoof
[59:59] behind.
[1:00:01] It's time to make footprints.
[1:00:03] Footprints means possession.
[1:00:09] Amen. If you're in a battle, do you got
[1:00:11] a sword? You got a
[1:00:13] shield. All of your warriors are there
[1:00:15] with you. And you meet on that center
[1:00:18] that that molding ground that that
[1:00:21] battle ground. Come here,
[1:00:24] brother. That right. Stand right here.
[1:00:28] Amen. We're fighting each other. We're
[1:00:29] fighting each other. And we have that
[1:00:31] sword up. We have that shield up. And
[1:00:32] all of that warriors will go up and push
[1:00:35] a little bit against me. Oh, this is
[1:00:36] going to be rough, ain't it? But every
[1:00:38] step I get, woo, there I got 5 10 in.
[1:00:42] That's right. Woo! There's another five
[1:00:44] 10 inches. Footprint means possession.
[1:00:47] Don't even try
[1:00:53] Danny. But get 4 foot, get 8 foot. Every
[1:00:57] inch of ground that you gain that you
[1:00:59] fight for, but B says the land is yours.
[1:01:03] This Bible is yours. But you're going to
[1:01:05] have to fight for every edge. You're
[1:01:07] going to have to fight the the the
[1:01:09] doubts that come into your mind. Amen.
[1:01:12] You're going to have to fight every
[1:01:13] thought that comes into your mind.
[1:01:15] That's where the battle is.
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:19] [Applause]
[1:01:28] Amen. Wear me out,
[1:01:37] Danny. Yeah, I thought about that.
[1:01:40] Every inch, every place where the foot
[1:01:44] of your soul puts is yours.
[1:01:48] However much of this you can take, it's
[1:01:51] yours.
[1:01:53] And I don't know about you, but I want
[1:01:56] complete victory.
[1:01:58] I want complete
[1:01:59] joy. I want complete peace
[1:02:03] that passes understanding.
[1:02:06] I want complete power of God in my life.
[1:02:08] Amen. Not just partial, not just a
[1:02:12] little bit.
[1:02:14] But I'm telling you, that's where our
[1:02:16] problem is.
[1:02:19] Amen. This partial stuff. There's a
[1:02:22] little bit. We got to go all in. We're
[1:02:25] going to have to go all in.
[1:02:29] Amen. Let me just start
[1:02:34] here. All in. And I thought allin.
[1:02:37] That's right. In Psalms, how many knows
[1:02:39] that David knew all about
[1:02:42] allin? He said, "Blessed is the man that
[1:02:45] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:02:46] ungodly, nor standeth in the way and of
[1:02:48] sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the
[1:02:50] scornful, but his delight is in the law
[1:02:53] of the Lord, and in his law does he
[1:02:55] meditate day and night." Now, how many
[1:02:58] knows that a lot of times that that's
[1:03:00] where we have we're so busy
[1:03:04] that we got to fight, we got to do
[1:03:06] battle just to have a little time.
[1:03:10] Amen. I went out there and did my
[1:03:12] chores, Brother John. You know, when I
[1:03:14] got done
[1:03:18] 11:00. That's quite something. You said,
[1:03:21] "Well, what time did you get up,
[1:03:22] brother?" as late as I
[1:03:25] [Laughter]
[1:03:27] could. I'm going to preach tonight. I'm
[1:03:29] going rest long as I can this morning.
[1:03:31] I'mma do my eight hours
[1:03:33] tonight. But still, you know, just and I
[1:03:36] thought, boy, you know, if I wouldn't
[1:03:38] have this, I'm here to tell you, brother
[1:03:40] Ben, we know that if we don't have time
[1:03:42] for prayer, we don't have time to study,
[1:03:45] it ain't going to be all that good. It
[1:03:48] takes dedication. It takes devotion. How
[1:03:50] many believe we need to be more
[1:03:51] dedicated?
[1:03:53] Oh my different time people rededicate
[1:03:56] the building and rededicate this. So
[1:03:58] many time we need to rededicate this
[1:04:00] thing and keep it dedicated. You want to
[1:04:03] be stronger, you're going to have to be
[1:04:05] more dedicated.
[1:04:08] Dedicated to prayer, dedicated dedicated
[1:04:12] to listening to the voice of God.
[1:04:17] Amen. I have several things I want to go
[1:04:19] through if I can. This is just the first
[1:04:21] part.
[1:04:25] Amen. Praise the
[1:04:28] Lord. In other words, you got to be
[1:04:30] focused. Ain't that right? Keep your
[1:04:34] focus. It's so easy to get distracted.
[1:04:40] I dare say you go very long without
[1:04:43] thinking about
[1:04:44] God, you're going to God is going to
[1:04:46] just kind of drift away from you.
[1:04:50] Ain't that right? Why do you think that
[1:04:52] he said on his law does he meditate day
[1:04:55] and night? It's something that's 24/7.
[1:05:00] Amen. Everything else is secondary.
[1:05:07] Joshua, he told Joshua, "This book of
[1:05:08] the law shall not depart out of the
[1:05:10] mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein
[1:05:12] day and night." Think about it. If he
[1:05:14] told Moses that, he told Joshua that,
[1:05:16] don't you think if we're going to be
[1:05:18] Christians, we're going to have to do
[1:05:19] the same thing? day and night, and thou
[1:05:21] mayest observe to do all according to
[1:05:23] all that is written therein. For then
[1:05:26] thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and
[1:05:28] then thou shalt have good success. I
[1:05:31] don't know about you, but that's what I
[1:05:33] want. Didn't Don't you want to be a
[1:05:35] successful Christian in this hour?
[1:05:40] I'm just going to preach it as it comes.
[1:05:41] Amen. We ain't got no persecution. There
[1:05:44] ain't people coming in here putting guns
[1:05:46] in our heads. Hey, you better quit.
[1:05:48] When's the last time somebody actually
[1:05:50] persecuted you for righteousness and for
[1:05:52] your goodness? No, it's not so much so,
[1:05:54] but what did what did brother Bam say?
[1:05:56] The pressure at this hour. It's riches.
[1:05:59] It's lukewarmness.
[1:06:01] That's what you got to fight.
[1:06:03] Lukewarmness and too much worldly
[1:06:06] things, riches and cares of life. They
[1:06:09] want to drown out the Holy Ghost out of
[1:06:11] you. It sucks the life out of you.
[1:06:15] The cares of life suck the life out of
[1:06:17] you. I even believe brother Bam said he
[1:06:19] said we could be this. We could be
[1:06:21] better Christians if it wasn't for all
[1:06:23] the other stuff that we had to
[1:06:25] do. We got to do it though. Can't stop
[1:06:28] doing it. Can't be lazy. But you got to
[1:06:31] get a balance. Amen.
[1:06:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. And I like this.
[1:06:38] I like because listen, he said you're
[1:06:40] going to have good success.
[1:06:42] Then he said, I commanded be strong and
[1:06:44] of courage, good courage. Be not afraid
[1:06:47] and don't be
[1:06:49] dismayed. Amen. Don't be dismayed. Don't
[1:06:51] let anything dismay you. I want to be
[1:06:54] the kind of soldier this battle that's
[1:06:56] all out that isn't dismayed about
[1:06:59] anything.
[1:07:02] Let's admit it. Stuff comes that rattles
[1:07:05] us.
[1:07:06] Amen.
[1:07:08] Sometimes it takes you a while for you
[1:07:10] to get your balance.
[1:07:14] Amen. But wasn't it something what Billy
[1:07:16] Pal said about his dad? He says, "The
[1:07:19] miracle of my dad was was such a miracle
[1:07:21] his heart that he could control every
[1:07:24] circumstance." I believe it was. No
[1:07:26] matter what comes his way, he controlled
[1:07:29] every
[1:07:30] circumstance.
[1:07:31] Amen. Lord, help us to be like that.
[1:07:35] So our thought tonight is first of all
[1:07:38] you have to you have to stay
[1:07:41] focused. In other words, keep your mind
[1:07:45] on God. Keep God first in
[1:07:49] everything. You get away from that, you
[1:07:52] get away from God.
[1:07:56] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Day and
[1:08:00] night. Another place he talks about tie
[1:08:02] it on your bed post. Meditate on him.
[1:08:06] Ain't this something? When you talk
[1:08:07] about the Lord, he comes near. We can
[1:08:10] come in here in the church all drooy and
[1:08:12] drabby, but let the preacher come here
[1:08:14] and start preaching the word. You begin
[1:08:16] to receive it. Hello. And some of that
[1:08:18] begins to go away. Amen.
[1:08:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:24] All right.
[1:08:31] The second thing that I want to talk
[1:08:33] about is us as warriors in this total
[1:08:39] war. I'm talking about defeating devil.
[1:08:43] The devil driving him from every part of
[1:08:48] your being.
[1:08:54] Hello. Amen. And the
[1:08:57] biggest enemy you got is
[1:09:02] yourself.
[1:09:04] That self.
[1:09:12] Amen.
[1:09:14] Amen. That little areas, those little
[1:09:17] areas that are still not surrendered to
[1:09:19] God. I want to say that. I'm going to
[1:09:22] talk talk about that for a minute. But
[1:09:24] listen, God wants us to be complete
[1:09:29] Christians.
[1:09:31] I want to be a complete Christian. I
[1:09:33] don't want to be a half Christian, not
[1:09:34] threequarter. I don't want to believe
[1:09:36] mostly or somewhat, but I want to be
[1:09:40] 100% Christian. I don't care nothing to
[1:09:43] be a nothing about being a fake.
[1:09:47] Amen. I don't want to be a Pharisee. You
[1:09:50] see? Amen.
[1:09:52] I don't want to be sad like a sad. You
[1:09:54] see? You see? I want to be a Christian,
[1:09:58] Lord. I want to be a Christian in my
[1:09:59] heart. Now, I want to be a whole
[1:10:01] Christian. Amen. A real warrior in this
[1:10:05] battle. Amen. Because I truly believe I
[1:10:09] was thinking this as I was meditating on
[1:10:11] the Lord of how brother Brandon would
[1:10:12] say, he says, "Something's fixing to
[1:10:14] happen. Something's fixing to happen."
[1:10:17] Didn't he keep saying that? Something's
[1:10:19] fixing to happen. and always something
[1:10:21] happened. I mean, how many believe
[1:10:23] something's fixing to happen? We'll
[1:10:25] still say something's fixing to happen.
[1:10:28] Now, I want to tell you something else.
[1:10:30] Something is happening.
[1:10:33] Something is happening in the hearts of
[1:10:35] his warriors. Something is happening in
[1:10:38] his church, in his people. God is
[1:10:40] moving.
[1:10:50] Because we in this battle, we're either
[1:10:53] going to be ready for the rapture or
[1:10:54] we're not.
[1:10:56] Is that right? But Abraham says he, you
[1:10:59] know, I don't see anything hindering the
[1:11:01] coming of the Lord outside of the
[1:11:02] readiness of the
[1:11:03] bride. Of us being
[1:11:06] ready.
[1:11:08] Amen. To be ready,
[1:11:11] to get ready. And we want to look at
[1:11:13] some of those things that we got to have
[1:11:15] in order to be ready with the help of
[1:11:16] God. But let's talk about this first.
[1:11:19] Let me read just being listen. Brother
[1:11:22] Abraham says when God called
[1:11:27] Moses, he called him to be a complete
[1:11:30] prophet. When God sends a man to do
[1:11:32] anything, he completely or
[1:11:36] totally he says that prophet was a total
[1:11:40] complete prophet. He completely equips
[1:11:42] him with everything that he has need of.
[1:11:48] Amen. How many glad for that? How many
[1:11:51] take that for yourself? Come on, suck
[1:11:53] that up. Say, "Yeah, that's right. He
[1:11:55] gives you everything that you have need
[1:11:58] of to be a Christian."
[1:12:03] Thoughts are just coming so fast.
[1:12:06] But brother Bam says, you know, if you
[1:12:07] could get everybody to be in a believer
[1:12:09] and get all doubt gone in the next 20
[1:12:11] minutes, 10 minutes, there wouldn't be a
[1:12:13] feeble one among us.
[1:12:16] There would be nobody desiring the Holy
[1:12:18] Ghost.
[1:12:19] So what's hindering? What's stopping it?
[1:12:24] Amen. He said, you know, everybody's
[1:12:25] making everybody an example, wanting to
[1:12:27] be an example. You remember when he
[1:12:28] preached on that talking about you know
[1:12:31] if you see watch hop along Cassidy and
[1:12:33] everybody's riding a broom or this that
[1:12:35] or the other they watch a little bit
[1:12:37] Tarzen of the apes and they're up in a
[1:12:38] tree. He was brother Brandham was he
[1:12:40] said for a tree you know and he says
[1:12:42] it's what people look at it's what they
[1:12:44] want to be he says if everybody really
[1:12:46] wanted to be like Jesus as much as that
[1:12:48] you could dismiss the police force you
[1:12:51] could dismiss the hospitals
[1:12:57] I don't see the police force dismissed
[1:12:59] yet.
[1:13:01] Amen. What about the hospitals? We still
[1:13:03] have to go visit the hospital. Would to
[1:13:05] God that we was at that place where the
[1:13:07] people at this church wouldn't have to
[1:13:09] go to the hospital.
[1:13:14] That's a kind of big, isn't it? But
[1:13:16] that's him. Amen.
[1:13:20] My Lord, help us to see where we're
[1:13:23] at. Amen. Perfectly. He completely
[1:13:26] equips him. Amen. God always completely
[1:13:30] or totally equips his
[1:13:35] man. And listen, just like you, if
[1:13:38] you're a Christian, God don't make any
[1:13:40] halfways. He makes complete total
[1:13:42] Christians. That's his impression is for
[1:13:46] you to be a 100% warrior,
[1:13:49] a soldier for the cross.
[1:13:56] Amen.
[1:14:00] One thing Hitler did was completely
[1:14:02] brainwash his soldiers from youth. Isn't
[1:14:05] that
[1:14:07] right? I mean, them folks believed that
[1:14:10] they were a superior
[1:14:14] race. It was terrible what they did
[1:14:16] because of what they believed. Amen. God
[1:14:20] doesn't brainwash us, but he washes our
[1:14:22] brain.
[1:14:25] Amen. The carnal mind is emnity against
[1:14:28] God. He wants to have let this mind be
[1:14:30] in you that was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:14:34] How many believes to be a real warrior
[1:14:36] in this battle, you've got to have the
[1:14:38] mind of Christ. You got to think like he
[1:14:40] does.
[1:14:45] Amen. All
[1:14:48] right. God don't make halfway preachers,
[1:14:51] but a preacher can be halfway. God and
[1:14:53] God makes his children Christians. But
[1:14:55] sometimes they're halfway Christians.
[1:14:57] God's not God's intentions for them to
[1:14:59] be that way. How many times have I pre
[1:15:01] repeated that? Maybe we need it again.
[1:15:03] Isn't that right? But it's their own
[1:15:05] way. Still a little bit of our own ways.
[1:15:07] How many believe that tonight? We as a
[1:15:09] Christian mature Christians. If we're
[1:15:11] still not what we ought to be, then all
[1:15:13] I can point you to is that there's still
[1:15:15] a little bit of your own ways in there.
[1:15:19] The Lord help us. There's still a little
[1:15:21] bit of our own ways there.
[1:15:30] What does a complete what does a real
[1:15:32] Christian complete Christian a real
[1:15:35] warrior look
[1:15:37] like? You want to see
[1:15:40] it? Here's a something that I read not
[1:15:44] so long
[1:15:46] ago.
[1:15:48] Amen. Amen. Listen. God cut every
[1:15:52] obstacles from the human beings that we
[1:15:55] might be connected back like in the
[1:15:57] garden of Eden. Now man, better stops. I
[1:16:00] was going to choke on it, but I'm going
[1:16:02] to say it. Man is
[1:16:03] omnipotent. Don't you believe that? Yes,
[1:16:06] he is.
[1:16:07] Amen. I love this phrase because it's
[1:16:11] the key to the next one. How can you be
[1:16:14] omnipotent? All things are possible.
[1:16:17] Nothing shall be impossible for you.
[1:16:20] That's true. How can you be that way?
[1:16:24] How many wants to know?
[1:16:26] Right here it is. A man that's fully
[1:16:36] surrendered. Men, I want to say in this
[1:16:39] complete and total
[1:16:41] war, a man that is really going to be
[1:16:44] victorious has to be totally and
[1:16:47] completely surrendered.
[1:16:50] In other words, you've got to realize
[1:16:52] that you're dust like the prophet of God
[1:16:54] said. No big eyes and little 's, no high
[1:16:57] horses, no pride. We all realize
[1:17:02] that we're just dust.
[1:17:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:09] That if time
[1:17:11] carries this nice suit, he'll dress me
[1:17:14] in a nice suit. If time carries and I
[1:17:17] don't make the rapture, which I'm
[1:17:18] trusting for the rapture.
[1:17:20] They'll laid his body in a
[1:17:23] casket. There's nothing to this body.
[1:17:26] There's nothing to me. There's nothing
[1:17:28] to you. The only thing that is of any
[1:17:30] value about us is him.
[1:17:35] Amen.
[1:17:36] We got to go on that Damascus dust and
[1:17:38] realize we're nothing and say, "God,
[1:17:40] keep me out of this. You have control."
[1:17:43] Completely surrender to God. My third
[1:17:46] thought here. Complete surrender.
[1:17:50] Like what, brother
[1:17:51] Ber? What kind of an example can you
[1:17:54] give
[1:17:56] me? All right. Let me give you an
[1:18:05] example.
[1:18:08] Amen. Wives submit.
[1:18:13] submission completely surrendered.
[1:18:16] Submit yourselves to your own husband as
[1:18:17] unto the Lord. For the husband is the
[1:18:20] head of the wife, even as Christ is the
[1:18:23] head of the church, and he is the savior
[1:18:25] of the body. Therefore, as the church is
[1:18:28] subject unto Christ, so let the wives be
[1:18:31] to their husbands in
[1:18:33] everything. Amen. So, what does God use
[1:18:37] for an illustration of complete
[1:18:38] surrenderance?
[1:18:41] submission. Perfect submission. All is
[1:18:44] at
[1:18:45] rest. My head tells me what I'm to do
[1:18:49] next. Amen.
[1:18:52] Praise the Lord. How many knows? The
[1:18:55] head controls the body. Kick. Kick
[1:19:00] back. Jump. Put your hands
[1:19:03] out. Amen. I mean, that's what God wants
[1:19:07] out of his church. Christ is the head.
[1:19:11] We are the
[1:19:14] body. Glory. Aren't you glad to be the
[1:19:17] body? And whatever the head says, that's
[1:19:20] what you do. How many believe we need to
[1:19:22] be sensitive every
[1:19:24] day, every hour of the day. If you have
[1:19:28] a question about something, here's a
[1:19:30] key. If you have a question about
[1:19:33] something and want don't know what to
[1:19:34] do, ask God.
[1:19:37] How many believe God will tell you?
[1:19:41] Sometimes you'll ask your pastor this,
[1:19:43] that, or the other. But I want to tell
[1:19:44] you, I believe it's important for every
[1:19:46] individual to be so close to God that
[1:19:49] sooner or later he'll tell you exactly
[1:19:52] what you ought to do. And you need to
[1:19:55] develop that relationship with God that
[1:19:57] you know, hey, I asked him and he told
[1:19:59] me.
[1:20:01] I ain't got to ask Tommy. I ain't got to
[1:20:03] ask. I ain't got to ask brother Brad.
[1:20:06] I've got a master that tells me what I
[1:20:08] ought to do, what I shouldn't do.
[1:20:11] Don't be a baby have to have people baby
[1:20:13] you all the time. No. Have an experience
[1:20:15] of your own. Have a relationship of your
[1:20:17] own. Hear the voice of God for yourself.
[1:20:24] How many believes that? Hear the voice
[1:20:26] of God for yourself. He'll answer you.
[1:20:28] He's not a dead God.
[1:20:31] We're just deaf when it comes to hearing
[1:20:33] sometimes. And we need to get our ear
[1:20:36] on.
[1:20:37] Say, "God, help me to hear
[1:20:40] when the spirit says something." That's
[1:20:43] why I don't try to do anything too
[1:20:44] hasty. Lord, what do you say in this?
[1:20:49] Amen. Praise the
[1:20:54] Lord. Amen.
[1:21:00] Okay. A man is omnipotent when he is
[1:21:05] fully
[1:21:07] surrendered to
[1:21:09] God. Fully surrendered to God. That's
[1:21:13] what it
[1:21:15] takes.
[1:21:18] Amen. Brother Bram says, "Not the
[1:21:20] power." Amen. and our
[1:21:24] brother Joe Adams. Brother Joe Adams
[1:21:27] preached on us having the power of God.
[1:21:29] The power that'll raise us
[1:21:33] up is right in us now.
[1:21:37] How many you believe that it's in us
[1:21:39] now? Resurrection power. We are now in
[1:21:42] heavenly places. We are now in the power
[1:21:45] of the resurrection.
[1:21:48] And he says, "If there wasn't a law to
[1:21:50] that power, sons and daughters of God
[1:21:53] would create them a world out here and
[1:21:56] go live a private life on it.
[1:22:01] You have to have the power in you. You
[1:22:04] have the power in you to do
[1:22:07] it."
[1:22:08] Amen. See, God is omnipotent. The power
[1:22:11] is that's in you. You could speak a
[1:22:14] world into existence and go live on it.
[1:22:16] Hallelujah. There you
[1:22:19] are. Ain't that something? He said, you
[1:22:21] got the power. You have the power to
[1:22:24] create a world and go live on it.
[1:22:31] Now, my next part is going to be that if
[1:22:37] we're going to go to a rapture and if
[1:22:38] we're going to conquer everything that
[1:22:39] the devil has and throws at us, one
[1:22:43] thing you're going to have to do is
[1:22:45] you're going to have to be uh like
[1:22:49] Enoch because before Enoch left, he had
[1:22:53] this testimony that he pleased God.
[1:22:59] And how do you please God? Well, the
[1:23:01] Bible says that without faith, it's
[1:23:03] impossible to please God. So, you have
[1:23:06] to have faith. How many believe you got
[1:23:09] to have faith? You got to live by faith.
[1:23:11] You got to walk by faith. And we want to
[1:23:13] take a look at this. I don't know if
[1:23:15] I'll get any further than this or not,
[1:23:17] but let's look at that the meaning and
[1:23:19] and and and the detailedness of the of
[1:23:22] faith because I was thinking, you
[1:23:27] know, I was thinking of this and then I
[1:23:29] pulled the quote up and he says, "We've
[1:23:31] got the power in us to create a world
[1:23:33] and go live on it." He says, "And that's
[1:23:36] the power that is in the church, but
[1:23:39] it's controlled by a
[1:23:41] law." Amen.
[1:23:44] And that law is not a bunch of a
[1:23:46] commandments or keeping a bunch of a
[1:23:48] commandment but it is the law of
[1:23:52] faith. The law of
[1:23:54] faith. Jesus said all things are
[1:23:57] possible to them that believe. If you
[1:23:59] can
[1:24:00] believe anything is possible.
[1:24:06] Let me stop
[1:24:08] there and ask you what faith is.
[1:24:12] Brother Bam
[1:24:13] said that faith is something that is
[1:24:16] revealed to you,
[1:24:19] something that's shown you. He also
[1:24:22] makes a statement that you ought to pray
[1:24:24] for revelation more than anything else
[1:24:27] in the world. Cuz revelation is God
[1:24:30] making his word real to you.
[1:24:41] real to you. That's what we need. The
[1:24:44] reality of God in our lives. Reason why
[1:24:47] we can't do that is because you've got
[1:24:50] to have
[1:24:51] faith. And how many believes you it's
[1:24:53] got to be the faith of
[1:24:56] God.
[1:25:00] Amen. God's faith. Paul said, "The life
[1:25:04] that I now live, I live by the faith of
[1:25:07] the son of God." The song says that
[1:25:10] we're living by faith. The just shall
[1:25:13] live by faith. That's what we're to live
[1:25:16] by if we're going to please God is we
[1:25:18] live by what God reveals to us.
[1:25:24] I preach what God reveals to me.
[1:25:31] Amen. All right. Let me go into this for
[1:25:34] just a little
[1:25:37] bit. The law of faith. Here it is.
[1:25:41] Here's the statement that
[1:25:43] really is going to help somebody that
[1:25:46] just thinks that you can just believe
[1:25:48] this
[1:25:50] uh believe something, ask for it, and
[1:25:53] then be greatly
[1:25:56] disappointed because that can happen.
[1:26:04] Because see, it's got to be revealed by
[1:26:06] faith. God has to reveal it to you.
[1:26:09] Faith is a revelation. The law of
[1:26:13] faith. Isn't that something how he put a
[1:26:15] clause in there? And here, this goes for
[1:26:19] just about
[1:26:21] anything. I truly believe.
[1:26:25] He says, "If you will believe it,
[1:26:26] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:26:31] believe."
[1:26:33] Amen. That is yours.
[1:26:38] Every place the soul of your feet sets
[1:26:40] by faith, God gives it to you.
[1:26:43] We could preach all night. How many
[1:26:44] knows Moses had a
[1:26:48] revelation from God that he is to go and
[1:26:50] deliver God's people? There wasn't
[1:26:53] enough devils in hell or hell to stop
[1:26:55] that. Brother Bam said if God reveals to
[1:26:58] me, he gives me the faith to go and
[1:27:00] raise Abraham Lincoln up, I would invite
[1:27:03] the whole world.
[1:27:06] It's very important. There's a big
[1:27:08] difference between you just trying to
[1:27:10] believe something and God quickening
[1:27:12] something to you. God giving you the
[1:27:15] faith for it.
[1:27:17] God's not going to give you faith for
[1:27:19] something that doesn't that isn't in his
[1:27:22] will. Even the Bible says God doesn't
[1:27:24] give you things that is not according to
[1:27:26] his will. And that's why we ask a
[1:27:31] myths. God has to drop the faith in your
[1:27:35] heart, the revelation.
[1:27:38] If it's cancer, healing for cancer, I
[1:27:41] don't care what it is, God has to drop
[1:27:44] that down in your heart. You can say, "I
[1:27:47] believe I'm healed. I'm believe I'm
[1:27:48] healed. I believe I'm healed. I'm
[1:27:50] believe." You may do that
[1:27:52] mentally. And
[1:27:55] die. Hello. But if God drops it down in
[1:27:58] there, you don't know how much I was how
[1:28:02] happy I was when my wife said, "No, it's
[1:28:05] not me. is not my faith. I don't get the
[1:28:09] credit. It's all him. If it's the right
[1:28:11] faith, it will produce what God has
[1:28:17] said. That's what it's going to take to
[1:28:19] be a mighty warrior for us not to miss
[1:28:22] it so much. How many would say, "Lord,
[1:28:23] help me not to miss it so much. Drop it
[1:28:25] down." Even brother Bannon wouldn't tell
[1:28:28] people, "Oh, your child is well. If I
[1:28:31] tell you that and then it doesn't
[1:28:32] happen, look what it'll do." No, I wait
[1:28:35] on God to tell me that's going to be.
[1:28:37] Then I will tell you.
[1:28:42] Amen. God's got to drop that faith down
[1:28:45] in your heart. And if he does, that's
[1:28:48] God's faith and it can't be stopped. How
[1:28:51] many believes it was God's faith
[1:28:53] according to Hebrews 11 there? By faith,
[1:28:55] we know that God created the heavens and
[1:28:57] the earth. By faith, we understand that
[1:29:00] Moses would come into Egypt, took over.
[1:29:03] By faith, Samson slew a thousand
[1:29:05] Philistines.
[1:29:09] Ain't that right? By faith, Shamgar got
[1:29:11] a revelation. I'm gonna knock him dead.
[1:29:14] When he went out there, he had no
[1:29:15] question. I'm going to knock him dead.
[1:29:18] And he did. And he become omnipotent.
[1:29:22] A man that was completely surrendered to
[1:29:24] God is omnipotent, all powerful. But you
[1:29:28] got to be surrendered to God. your will
[1:29:30] to surrender to God.
[1:29:33] Everything about you surrendered to God.
[1:29:36] Not one arm in and one arm out. This
[1:29:38] halfway stuff will never work. A halfway
[1:29:41] walk with God will never work.
[1:29:45] Hello.
[1:29:50] Having a revival every six months ain't
[1:29:52] going to work. Having a revival once a
[1:29:54] year ain't going to work. That's not the
[1:29:57] way that we are. We're the kind of
[1:29:59] people that have a revival all the time.
[1:30:03] You never have to let the revival die.
[1:30:10] Glory. They must have took a picture and
[1:30:12] put it on that paper out there. Brother
[1:30:14] Tommy took a picture of that fire. Holy
[1:30:17] Ghost fire.
[1:30:24] Well, we're all assembled here today and
[1:30:27] we just want to share a few thoughts
[1:30:29] with you that we feel like maybe we
[1:30:31] could share might help you a little
[1:30:33] and boring as all get out.
[1:30:38] No fire,
[1:30:43] life, joy.
[1:30:46] Oh, I'm just so happy. I can't stand
[1:30:49] myself.
[1:30:53] What does it say? If you're happy, why
[1:30:55] don't you notify your face?
[1:31:00] You need a notification if you really
[1:31:02] have joy.
[1:31:04] Amen. You'll act like these little kids
[1:31:05] when they go out there. They'll just
[1:31:07] jump and run and carry on. Why? Because
[1:31:11] well, oh my. How many knows it's so
[1:31:13] needful? The baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:31:16] the falling of the Holy Ghost that sets
[1:31:19] the preacher free. Amen. Should fall on
[1:31:21] you and sets you free, too. It's not
[1:31:24] just for me. It's for
[1:31:27] everybody because there's liberty in the
[1:31:30] Holy Ghost. There's freedom in the Holy
[1:31:32] Ghost. There's joy in the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:34] And every one of us can have
[1:31:37] it. Yeah. Give me five. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:43] Glory.
[1:31:46] See, where Christ is, there's liberty.
[1:31:49] There's freedom.
[1:31:51] We need more of it.
[1:31:54] The preacher needs to let go. He needs
[1:31:56] to get out of the way. The congregation
[1:31:58] needs to let go and get out of the
[1:32:02] way. Let God have his
[1:32:06] way. Worship God like never before. Live
[1:32:09] for him like never before. Fight like
[1:32:12] never before. Believe like never
[1:32:16] before. I ain't got that much breath.
[1:32:22] God is
[1:32:30] good.
[1:32:34] No
[1:32:36] conditional surrender.
[1:32:41] unconditional. You're getting off my
[1:32:43] land and you're getting all the way off
[1:32:46] my land. Don't you ever come back.
[1:32:49] That's what we're gonna tell the devil.
[1:32:51] Don't you never come back. Don't you
[1:32:54] never try to steal my joy again. Don't
[1:32:56] you never rob me again. We don't have a
[1:32:59] partnership. You can't live in this part
[1:33:02] of my life. You can't live in that part
[1:33:04] of my life. Be gone, devil.
[1:33:07] Be gone, depression.
[1:33:11] We're here for a total war. Complete
[1:33:14] war. We're gone to the other end. We're
[1:33:16] going to find that Hitler. We're going
[1:33:17] to find his bunkers. We're going to go
[1:33:19] all the way down there. He better commit
[1:33:24] suicide cuz we will shoot him up. We
[1:33:28] will blow him away. Hello. That's what
[1:33:31] we'll do to devil. Don't you hide in no
[1:33:32] basement nowhere. Don't you hide in no
[1:33:35] corner of this church. You better get on
[1:33:37] out.
[1:33:39] We want the lame to walk. We want the
[1:33:41] sick to raise be
[1:33:43] healed. We want the dead to rise. Christ
[1:33:47] can do anything.
[1:33:55] We want the clock to stop.
[1:34:10] Give me a minute to catch my breath.
[1:34:12] That all
[1:34:17] right. Amen. How many believes we're not
[1:34:20] just fair weather Christians? God don't
[1:34:23] want just fair feather fair weather
[1:34:26] Christian. Man, the Bible says if that
[1:34:29] we by sufferings and through much
[1:34:31] patience come to perfection. Now we
[1:34:34] praise God in the good times. We praise
[1:34:37] God in the bad times. We conduct
[1:34:39] ourselves with joy. Whatever trials come
[1:34:42] our way. Blessed be the name of the
[1:34:44] Lord. If Job could lose all of his
[1:34:46] children and still said God takes away
[1:34:49] God gives, blessed be the name of the
[1:34:51] Lord. He worshiped God. He was at total
[1:34:54] war with the enemy. His wife might even
[1:34:57] give up, but he
[1:35:00] didn't. Why? Because Job was such a
[1:35:04] great man. No. Because the great God was
[1:35:06] in the great job. Hello. It ain't the
[1:35:09] Holy Church. It's the Holy Ghost in the
[1:35:12] church. That's who gets promoted. That's
[1:35:14] who get
[1:35:17] exalted. It wasn't Samson. It was a
[1:35:20] surrendered Samson that when he stayed
[1:35:23] in the place where God had put him,
[1:35:24] there was no stopping him.
[1:35:28] Woo. Tell it to me again. How many know
[1:35:31] there's no stopping this
[1:35:33] bride? Cuz I'm here to them tapes.
[1:35:36] They're jumping off the books and
[1:35:37] they're coming into my heart. God is
[1:35:39] building a statue of a perfect man, not
[1:35:42] imperfect man. How many wants to come to
[1:35:45] the fullness of the stature of Christ,
[1:35:47] not a partiality?
[1:35:54] That's why I'm so thankful that all the
[1:35:57] babying, all the
[1:35:59] bickering. Oh, the pastor doesn't do
[1:36:01] this and this one doesn't do that. I'm
[1:36:04] sorry. Let me go over here and flop this
[1:36:06] down in the bathroom and pull you out a
[1:36:10] diaper. Cuz that's what you need. You
[1:36:12] need a diaper. Brother said, "You're
[1:36:15] still in kindergarten. You're still a
[1:36:17] baby.
[1:36:20] You ain't overgotten. You haven't
[1:36:22] overcome
[1:36:23] anything. How many believes that Jesus
[1:36:26] is coming? He's coming not for defeated
[1:36:28] people. He's coming for overcomers.
[1:36:31] People who have overcome.
[1:36:35] That's who he's coming for.
[1:36:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:48] Pull that parachute.
[1:36:52] We're done.
[1:36:56] That's in memory of Brother Juwel. Ain't
[1:36:58] that right? In memory of Brother Juul.
[1:37:00] Not that he's dead, but just all the
[1:37:01] good times. The good times he's preached
[1:37:03] to us. Pray God still gives him long
[1:37:05] life. Amen. We love Brother Juwel. He's
[1:37:09] always said, "Let me parachute out of
[1:37:11] here." Praise the
[1:37:15] Lord. You're going, church. You're
[1:37:18] moving. Don't let the devil have one
[1:37:20] foot. Don't let him push you back that
[1:37:23] 12 ines. You keep going forward and
[1:37:26] forward and forward.
[1:37:30] Amen. God bless you. Okay, let's
[1:37:34] stand. And before the musician, before
[1:37:37] the musicians come, Amen. We want to
[1:37:40] have
[1:37:42] prayer. Amen. For brother Wilson Fox and
[1:37:45] Tracy Fox. Their little
[1:37:48] boy, precious little son, didn't make it
[1:37:52] in birth early this morning. And I can
[1:37:56] only imagine it. Their sorrow, how
[1:37:58] they're feeling. Amen.
[1:38:01] I don't know if they'll be listening,
[1:38:03] but I'll say this. You have to be
[1:38:06] careful during that time because the
[1:38:09] devil will whisper to you. He'll tell
[1:38:12] you things like, "God isn't real. God
[1:38:15] doesn't love you or you did something
[1:38:17] wrong or whatever it might be." Ain't
[1:38:19] that right? And you can just really
[1:38:22] depress yourself even more. Or you can
[1:38:25] have this confidence that he's in God's
[1:38:28] hands and he's in much better hands than
[1:38:31] even the parents would be. Amen. Sure,
[1:38:34] you wanted him, but he's in good hands.
[1:38:36] And we believe you'll see him on that
[1:38:38] day. Ain't that right? Realize and live
[1:38:41] for the day. Just as brother Brandon
[1:38:43] when his little baby died and his wife
[1:38:44] died, he lived to see the day that he
[1:38:47] would see him again. Amen. We pray that
[1:38:51] they'll be encouraged that the Holy
[1:38:53] Spirit will give them strength through
[1:38:55] the thoughts that they will have on the
[1:38:57] word and the promises of God. The
[1:38:58] promises of God is their only hope for
[1:39:01] strength. Amen. God knew best. Ain't
[1:39:07] that right? God knows best.
[1:39:11] Amen. You worship him. He love Lord
[1:39:14] gave. He take away. Blessed be the name
[1:39:17] of the Lord. don't always understand it,
[1:39:18] but we trust his hand. Amen.
[1:39:22] Yes, brother Joe.
[1:39:27] No, I haven't heard.
[1:39:39] So Monday night we were coming from
[1:39:41] Hopkinsville and we seen a bunch of uh
[1:39:43] heard a bunch of sirens and saw lights
[1:39:45] and so forth. Well, come to find out the
[1:39:46] next day I found out that four uh
[1:39:49] Menanite girls that three of them uh
[1:39:52] were the daughters of John Hoover down
[1:39:55] the road and a visiting friend of their
[1:39:57] a relative or visitor from Pennsylvania
[1:40:00] drunk driver run over them in front of
[1:40:02] Hampton's meat market. And um it's it's
[1:40:06] to my my knowledge that that two of them
[1:40:09] are very critical. Um and I had actually
[1:40:12] heard that two of them had passed, but I
[1:40:13] heard that was not true. So we're hoping
[1:40:15] that's not true, but uh we know they're
[1:40:18] in critical need. It's like I said,
[1:40:20] three sisters. One of the sisters was in
[1:40:22] very critical condition. I think one of
[1:40:24] them worked at Slayighbox Bakery. Uh but
[1:40:27] just a terrible situation for that
[1:40:29] family and it kind of it's devastated
[1:40:31] the community and and the ones who know
[1:40:34] them. And so let's just remember them in
[1:40:36] prayer and just trust that the the Lord
[1:40:37] will uh go and intervene in that
[1:40:39] situation as well. and and uh we believe
[1:40:41] he's more than able to to go to that
[1:40:44] hospital uh and touch those young ladies
[1:40:46] and if they don't know him in the way
[1:40:48] they should, we trust that he will speak
[1:40:50] to their hearts that they would turn
[1:40:51] their lives to him and just believe that
[1:40:54] uh he'll move in their life and and just
[1:40:57] be with the community during this time.
[1:40:58] So, and you know, you know, we we pray
[1:41:01] for them and it's sometimes it's hard to
[1:41:03] say, but we we have to also be conscious
[1:41:05] of the guy who hit him. Even though he
[1:41:07] was intoxicated, he was under the
[1:41:09] influence, he probably needs the Lord
[1:41:12] more than they did. So, it's all in the
[1:41:15] perspective. You look at it and it's
[1:41:16] hard to say that sometimes, but uh let's
[1:41:18] remember those young ladies if we could.
[1:41:21] All right. Thank you, brother Brad.
[1:41:23] Let's go in deepest of sincerity. Bow
[1:41:26] our heads. Also continue to remember
[1:41:30] sister
[1:41:31] Marjorie. She is also hanging in there.
[1:41:35] It's kind of in
[1:41:37] balance.
[1:41:38] And for every word the doctor comes and
[1:41:41] tells her, it's has so much meaning. And
[1:41:45] she really looks for a positive word, a
[1:41:49] good word. and she really hasn't had
[1:41:50] heard any bad words. They're still
[1:41:53] trying to figure out why it was that
[1:41:55] that water built up like that. So,
[1:41:57] they're going to have to check her liver
[1:41:58] out and a few things, but right now
[1:42:00] she's holding steady and eating a little
[1:42:02] bit this morning, but still very hard
[1:42:05] time having being able to eat and her
[1:42:07] belly and everything still hurts a lot.
[1:42:09] So, let's remember her too. Let's all of
[1:42:11] us pray. Our heavenly father as we come
[1:42:14] before you Lord Jesus tonight father
[1:42:17] with these needs first of all these

[1:42:37] critical condition Lord God that they

[1:42:53] We believe God that you said if we ask
[1:42:56] anything in your name that you would do
[1:42:58] it, Lord. And then, Brother Wilson and
[1:43:01] Tracy,
[1:43:02] Lord, not being able to have their
[1:43:05] little boy, Lord Jesus, but you took him

[1:43:10] depths of our heart pray God that you

[1:43:18] And we pray for them Lord. Our heart
[1:43:19] goes out to them asking God that you
[1:43:22] would quicken scriptures to him. Speak
[1:43:25] to them, Father. Speak to their hearts
[1:43:26] during this tender moment. Lord, may the
[1:43:30] enemy be enemy be thwarted. May they not
[1:43:32] be depressed and completely downhearted
[1:43:35] and discouraged of serving you or
[1:43:37] anything like that, God, but they may
[1:43:40] they realize that God allows us to go
[1:43:42] through these things for a reason, Lord.
[1:43:44] And we ask, God, for strength for them,
[1:43:46] Lord Jesus, Brother Wilson, and for
[1:43:48] Sister Tracy, our heart father goes to
[1:43:51] them. May your Holy Spirit go to them
[1:43:53] just now and bring a peace, Father,
[1:43:56] about them. May they have a peace that
[1:43:59] their baby is okay, that their baby is
[1:44:01] in good hands. And so we ask God for all
[1:44:04] these requests, Lord, tonight, God, that
