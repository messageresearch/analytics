[37:30] start to a new year so how many say

[37:35] tell you what the Lord's certainly been
[37:37] good to us this past year and and
[37:38] thankful for all the opportunities he's
[37:40] done for us and and the church here and
[37:44] watching the the growth of the church
[37:45] and and uh
[37:47] Esther and his family and all they do
[37:50] for the church
[37:51] and and you just don't see the the
[37:54] behind the scenes that goes on
[37:56] throughout the year and we just asked
[37:58] the Lord's blessing on on them uh this
[38:01] 2023
[38:02] . so but I was uh you know I I was
[38:06] thinking almost called brother Byler
[38:08] last night and said I'm just don't think
[38:10] I'm going to make it to service and
[38:12] just been feeling a little under the
[38:14] weather off and on throughout the week
[38:16] and you know uh
[38:18] the prophet notice there's different uh
[38:21] uh I guess uh demons and tormentors that
[38:24] are throughout the countries and about
[38:26] December and January of every year
[38:28] there's one at vacations in in Kentucky
[38:30] and it causes me to have a dry cough and
[38:33] just it's just aggravating and
[38:36] and uh and I've been having a little bit
[38:38] of chills and and stuff it's not not
[38:40] anymore I feel fine but I think it's
[38:42] just more sinus infection than anything
[38:44] so
[38:45] um but yeah I was almost going to call
[38:47] him last night and say you know what I
[38:49] don't I don't think I'm going to be able
[38:50] to to preach tomorrow night so but it's
[38:53] a I didn't want to give the devil that
[38:54] satisfaction
[38:56] so I said I'm Gonna Keep studying I'm
[38:58] gonna keep praying I'm gonna keep
[38:59] putting forth and we'll just let God
[39:01] move on the scene so Brother David asked
[39:04] me he said in the back he sits are you
[39:05] ready I said are you ever ready
[39:08] are you ever ready because I tell you
[39:11] you can prepare you can pray you can
[39:13] study you can read but if he don't come
[39:15] on the scene
[39:17] the service is just not going to go very
[39:20] well and uh what caused him on the scene
[39:23] you do
[39:24] so we covet your prayers as ministers we
[39:27] covered your prayers so you know I I
[39:30] hope you you know the service this
[39:32] morning I I tell you we uh
[39:35] together
[39:36] we uh preparing and I've had stuff on my
[39:40] mind all week and then it seems like we
[39:42] went a different direction a different
[39:43] scripture completely different scripture
[39:45] come to me yesterday and and I'll just
[39:48] be honest I thought am I just doing this
[39:50] on my own or or what is going on you
[39:53] know because I just didn't feel
[39:55] brother Butler will and he knows you run
[39:58] through times like this you just wonder
[39:59] am I just manufacturing something to
[40:02] tell the people or God or is this you
[40:04] and because it certainly was
[40:06] what I felt like I wanted to preach and
[40:09] you know probably every song every song
[40:13] or singer when they've been asked to
[40:16] sing a special they sat down their seat
[40:17] and they they prepare and they get their
[40:19] mind right and they know what song
[40:21] they're going to sing but their worst
[40:22] nightmare must be if the person gets up
[40:24] in front of them and sings
[40:26] the song they've prepared
[40:29] that must be the worst nightmare well
[40:31] it's a preacher's worst nightmare too so
[40:33] brother Butler gets up this morning he
[40:35] says turn with me to Philippians I was
[40:37] like no no way
[40:40] there's no way he can he can be reading
[40:42] out of Philippians
[40:44] and uh I thought well he surely he can't
[40:47] pick pick my scripture and I thought
[40:48] well you know there's only four chapters
[40:50] in the book so there's a pretty good
[40:52] chance he's going somewhere close to it
[40:54] yeah Philippians 3. so that's where
[40:57] we're at tonight too but it's it's it's
[41:00] all good you know you know and I listen
[41:02] to the songs and as a as a minister you
[41:05] try to pick up on every little detail
[41:06] and be sensitive to the spirit and
[41:09] sensitive to the things that are said
[41:10] and done and
[41:12] the free service and and and those kinds
[41:16] of things and so I think we're right on
[41:18] track and he didn't preach from the
[41:20] direction I'm preaching but uh we'll
[41:22] take a little different approach
[41:24] um but here we are a brand new day right
[41:26] January 1.
[41:28] and I hope everybody's got their goals
[41:30] set in place I was coming to church just
[41:33] a few minutes ago and I seen somebody
[41:35] had an elliptical on the back of the
[41:37] their trailer and I thought well that'll
[41:39] be a closed hanger in about four days
[41:42] so that's what happens to most
[41:43] ellipticals you know
[41:45] but here we are brand new day and
[41:48] January 1st 2023.
[41:51] and thinking about this I want us to
[41:53] look tonight and just kind of my thought
[41:54] was this
[41:57] looking at this first day of the year
[41:59] you could say this is the first day of
[42:01] the rest of your life
[42:03] you've heard that and we've heard it and
[42:05] we've said it and other people have said
[42:07] it and preached on it but the first day
[42:08] of the rest of your life and I thought
[42:11] to myself what a great opportunity it is
[42:13] to know that we have a day-to-day we set
[42:17] aside a first day of the year but in
[42:20] Christ it's every day we a week every
[42:23] day we get up is the first day of the
[42:25] rest of our life and so in reality in
[42:27] the grand scheme of things you could do
[42:29] something if your life that'll really
[42:32] make a count that'll that'll make
[42:34] something happen that God can be
[42:36] pleasing to God because when we think
[42:37] about life we think about time
[42:40] but when we look at
[42:42] really what our life is our life is just
[42:45] a vapor
[42:46] it is so minuscule and and just we're
[42:49] just here it's just a speck on a set of
[42:52] sand and this and the beaches of the
[42:54] sand of time because when we think about
[42:56] that we think about oh we've had a long
[42:58] day we've been at work and man I'm tired
[43:00] and then time drags on and drags on but
[43:04] in God's eyes
[43:05] it's just a snap of the finger things
[43:07] that torment us things that we Hound the
[43:10] things that Hound us it's just it's just
[43:12] a vapor it's here and it's gone and so
[43:15] today is the first day of the rest of
[43:18] your life and that may sound a little a
[43:20] little bold and a little over the top
[43:22] but I want you to think about this
[43:23] because if we are serving a living God
[43:27] if we're serving a living God tonight
[43:29] and the word of God says your steps are
[43:31] ordered by the Lord
[43:33] and your steps are ordered by the Lord
[43:35] then you can rest assured that God's
[43:37] going to make something in your life
[43:38] count
[43:39] whatever you do from this day forward if
[43:41] this is the first day of the rest of
[43:43] your life
[43:44] let it be your best day
[43:49] brother Branham says this and we'll read
[43:51] the scripture here in just a minute
[43:53] I've got a little concoction here it's a
[43:57] lemon and honey and water so we've been
[44:00] slurfing on this for a little bit trying
[44:02] to keep the cough down so uh bear with
[44:05] us and and we'll get through this
[44:08] so brother Brown says this this is a New
[44:11] Year's night Eve he's preaching he says
[44:13] of course everybody's got a Val Road out
[44:16] and a pledge you're going to go and make
[44:18] for New Year's then about a day after
[44:21] tomorrow they'll all be broke
[44:24] he said and so you know you turn a new
[44:26] page every year and then you turn back
[44:29] the next morning and say I did it again
[44:32] how many has ever been there
[44:35] I've lost a thousand pounds in my life
[44:44] or more
[44:49] he says there's one thing he said that I
[44:51] would say and that is like the Apostle
[44:54] Paul said forgetting those things that
[44:56] are in the past all of my mistakes and
[44:58] all the things that I have done
[44:59] impressed towards the mark of the High
[45:02] Calling he said
[45:04] in Christ he said that's my only regrets
[45:07] that I have is errors that I've made in
[45:10] the past year and the past part of my
[45:12] life and I only humbly ask him for Grace
[45:15] to press on toward the mark of the High
[45:18] Calling he said I'm sure that's the
[45:21] testimony of all of us we'd all feel
[45:24] that way
[45:26] let's stand to our feet we read the
[45:28] scripture as we as we read and we'll
[45:30] stand and in honor of the scripture but
[45:32] I want you to think about that as we're
[45:33] as we're reading
[45:35] and brother Byler hit on some of that
[45:36] this morning but this morning we did a
[45:39] reconsecration
[45:41] we rededicated
[45:43] and we re applying ourselves to the Lord
[45:46] to the Lord God Almighty
[45:49] now what do we do with that now that
[45:52] we're here with this day what are we
[45:54] going to do with this day
[45:55] and that would be my my uh title for the
[45:58] scripture for the message tonight is
[46:01] what will you do with this day
[46:04] what will you do with this day
[46:06] Philippians 3
[46:08] and we'll start with verse 10.
[46:11] that I may know him
[46:13] and the power of his resurrection
[46:16] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[46:19] being made conformidable unto any means
[46:23] I might attain unto the resurrection of
[46:26] the Dead
[46:27] not as though I had already attained
[46:29] either were already perfect but I follow
[46:33] after if that I may apprehend now when
[46:36] you look at that word I may apprehend it
[46:38] means to lay hold of
[46:41] for that which also I am apprehended
[46:45] of Christ Jesus so what Paul's saying
[46:48] here is I want to lay hold of all that
[46:51] Christ is because I've come to realize
[46:54] that Christ has laid hold of me
[46:57] so now you've got Paul and you've got
[46:59] Christ in there looking at each other
[47:00] and they've got a hold of each other and
[47:02] one greater place is there to be than
[47:04] hand in hand with Jesus Christ
[47:07] and Paul recognizes this and he says
[47:10] Brethren I count not myself to have
[47:12] apprehended but that's one thing I do
[47:14] forgetting those things which are behind
[47:18] and reaching forth unto those things
[47:21] which are before I press toward the mark
[47:24] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[47:27] in Christ Jesus let us therefore as be
[47:31] perfect thus be thus minded and if
[47:33] anything ye be otherwise-minded God
[47:37] shall reveal even this unto you
[47:40] nevertheless where to we have already
[47:42] attained let us walk by the same rule
[47:45] let us mind the same thing Brethren be
[47:48] followers together of me
[47:51] what's he saying
[47:53] watch me
[47:56] watch me the way I act watch me the way
[47:59] I conduct myself
[48:01] Watch Me Be followers together of me and
[48:05] mark them which are also which also walk
[48:08] as ye have for an example for us
[48:13] let's pray Heavenly Father we're just
[48:15] grateful to be in your house tonight
[48:16] Lord and Lord we've come before you
[48:19] today Lord consecrating ourselves
[48:21] rededicating and committing Our Lives
[48:24] fully into your hands today Lord and now
[48:26] we want to ask ourselves what will we do
[48:28] with this day now now that we've done
[48:30] that what will we do with this day and
[48:33] how we approach the days to come Lord we
[48:36] just asked or that you would move on the
[48:38] scene in a mighty way tonight Lord that
[48:40] you would speak to our hearts and as
[48:42] always draw Us close to you Lord because
[48:43] there's no greater feeling than to be in
[48:45] your presence tucked up close into you
[48:47] Lord Jesus when I'll tell you we love
[48:49] you we appreciate you in Christ's name
[48:51] amen you can be seated
[48:54] foreign
[48:55] so I want to speak like I said on what
[48:58] will you do with this day and I'm not
[49:01] going to try to keep you very long
[49:02] tonight I'm going to be conscious of
[49:03] time thank you for your for coming
[49:05] tonight and your sacrifice I think God
[49:07] will honor your sacrifice I know you've
[49:09] missed your nap but
[49:10] please hold off for about 30 minutes
[49:13] before you nap
[49:16] brother Brown said many people say I'm
[49:18] going to quit lying
[49:22] and I'm going to get him around a better
[49:23] class of people I'm going to get into
[49:24] some Society he said here it is God
[49:27] don't care about you turning a new page
[49:30] in our minds as human beings we always
[49:32] want to set goals and we should and we
[49:34] want to get better and we should and we
[49:37] want to be successful in life and we
[49:39] should
[49:39] but he says that is not what the most
[49:41] important thing is to God God does not
[49:44] care about you turning a new page he
[49:46] wants you to turn your heart to Christ
[49:48] he says he wants you to turn your heart
[49:50] to Christ and let him make out of you
[49:52] not what you can do but what he can do
[49:55] not by your good works but by what he
[49:58] does through you he says turn your heart
[50:01] to Christ because Mercy has bought that
[50:04] nothing works that's any man should
[50:06] boast he says for we are Gods because it
[50:10] isn't what I am
[50:12] it isn't Paul wasn't Paul Paul didn't
[50:14] say it isn't what I am but he said it's
[50:17] what God is in me you see brothers and
[50:20] sisters as we look at the life of Paul
[50:22] we see that from the very first day of
[50:24] his conversion his desire and his sole
[50:28] purpose was he wanted that personal
[50:30] relationship with God Paul's number one
[50:33] desire was I want to know the power of
[50:36] his resurrection
[50:38] he states that I want to know the power
[50:40] of His Resurrection The Fellowship of
[50:43] his sufferies I want to know him in such
[50:45] a way that I've never known him before
[50:47] in my life because Paul can draw
[50:51] remembrance and recollect a time that
[50:54] when everything he knew was legalistic
[50:57] everything all lived for God in the
[50:59] kingdom of God was about rules and laws
[51:02] and don't do this and don't do that and
[51:05] and read this and read that and Walk
[51:07] This Way dressed this way act this way
[51:10] Paul says I want much much more
[51:13] than rules and regulations and laws and
[51:16] do's and don'ts he says I want to know
[51:19] Christ that died on the cross for me
[51:22] that is the Christ that I want to know I
[51:24] want to know his power in such a way
[51:26] that I've never seen it before
[51:29] so Paul wasn't interested in his self
[51:32] anymore
[51:34] because that's what Paul was doing
[51:36] before prior he was interested in his
[51:38] status
[51:39] he was interested in setting goals and
[51:42] becoming more prominent and being a
[51:44] better Pharisee
[51:46] are you with me but now it's no more
[51:49] about how I want to be good for himself
[51:51] but he's wanting to know more about
[51:53] Christ
[51:56] to know Jesus
[51:59] is not the same as knowing his
[52:02] historical life
[52:04] it's not the same
[52:06] there's no nothing nothing similar to it
[52:09] it's not the same knowing the doctrines
[52:12] as it is knowing Christ on the cross
[52:17] foreign
[52:18] we can say we know someone because we
[52:21] recognize them
[52:22] right
[52:25] if I point to this picture
[52:27] you recognize that you know who that is
[52:29] if I point to this picture this has been
[52:31] ingrained in our minds as children
[52:33] you know who this is so
[52:36] facial recognition says I know them
[52:39] if I show you a picture of him in in
[52:41] Africa or wherever he I know who that is
[52:44] you know him
[52:47] you can say you know someone because
[52:49] you're acquainted with what he does
[52:51] in other words maybe it's somebody you
[52:53] go and go to the market and hey I know
[52:55] them they work at the market hey that's
[52:57] the butcher at Piggly Wiggly that's
[52:59] that's the the woman that makes bread
[53:01] over at the Dutch Country
[53:03] you know these people by by what they do
[53:05] and you associate it and you can look at
[53:07] someone you say well I know them because
[53:09] I'm on speaking terms with them
[53:12] their relationship's getting a little
[53:13] stronger then because you kind of got a
[53:15] communication you can look at somebody
[53:17] and you can talk to them and they know
[53:18] you and you know them I know them
[53:22] and you can look at someone and and
[53:24] maybe know him because you spend time in
[53:26] their house or with their family and you
[53:29] begin to grow and mold and you begin to
[53:31] know them in a much closer way maybe you
[53:33] know somebody and and many of us have
[53:36] been married and you begin to know it
[53:37] somebody through marriage and all of a
[53:39] sudden now you begin to know everything
[53:41] about this person
[53:43] good bad and ugly
[53:45] you know it
[53:47] but there's something different
[53:50] there's something different there's a
[53:52] different way of knowing who Jesus is
[53:55] that includes all of this but it goes so
[53:58] much farther and so far beyond of just
[54:01] knowing who he is by a picture or by
[54:03] scripture or knowing this or that it's
[54:05] about knowing and having that personal
[54:07] relationship that every drop of blood
[54:09] that was shed on Calvary was shed for
[54:12] you to cover your sins for the remission
[54:15] of your sins for your healing
[54:18] that's knowing god and that's what Paul
[54:22] was wanting to know I want to know him
[54:24] in such an intimate way that he's so
[54:27] important to me that nothing else in
[54:29] this world matters
[54:33] if I were to ask confessions
[54:39] of what what are what are your goals
[54:42] many many of them were I want my
[54:44] business to succeed here I want this
[54:47] I want this
[54:49] I want this for this and
[54:53] sometimes our goals and ambitions
[54:57] are not what really is important to God
[55:04] knowing brothers and sisters knowing
[55:07] Jesus
[55:08] means knowing his power
[55:12] that ought to be our number one goal
[55:14] tonight that ought to be our number one
[55:16] thought is I want to know just like Paul
[55:19] wanted to know I want to know the power
[55:21] of his resurrection
[55:24] I want to know the power of his
[55:26] resurrection I want to know that life
[55:28] that is given to us now
[55:30] not when we die
[55:33] that power is laying here for us today
[55:39] you know Sister Johnny she just crossed
[55:41] over
[55:44] she does that from one dimension of time
[55:47] like a vapor into an eternal
[55:50] destination a Time
[55:53] you know she gained not one bit of Power
[55:55] by doing that
[55:58] why are you so quiet
[56:01] why do we why do we think that because
[56:03] man would make it to heaven now we're
[56:05] powerful
[56:06] no God says I'm going to give you
[56:08] everything that I am now now through the
[56:12] power of my resurrection through the
[56:13] power of my resurrection healing is
[56:16] yours today because the power of the
[56:19] Resurrection said by his stripes and it
[56:22] was a finished work on Calvary
[56:25] I won't strike him no more
[56:28] he took his last stripe why so you can
[56:31] have the power of the resurrection of
[56:33] healing today love is yours today
[56:37] love is a power of a resurrection
[56:42] you don't believe me let me ask you this
[56:44] what does it take for a person to go be
[56:46] beaten spit on mocked and scorned the
[56:50] way he was to die and Rise Again
[56:54] that's love
[56:56] that is the power of the resurrection of
[56:58] love
[56:59] that he would do such as that for you
[57:02] peace is yours today understanding Grace
[57:06] overcoming forgiveness all of this stuff
[57:09] is the power of the resurrection of
[57:11] Jesus Christ
[57:17] the power of the resurrection of Jesus
[57:19] Christ is evidencing power
[57:21] it's evidence that everything has been
[57:23] sealed that everything Jesus did was
[57:26] true
[57:28] do you think about that
[57:32] it's powerful
[57:34] the life that Jesus lived
[57:37] think about the Miracles think about all
[57:40] the things that happened in those 33
[57:42] years there
[57:44] but what's more powerful
[57:47] is he done something by the resurrection
[57:51] that sealed exactly what he was nobody
[57:54] could doubt anymore anything he'd done
[57:58] there could be no more naysayers why
[58:00] because he said destroy this temple in
[58:02] three days I'll raise it again
[58:04] we're talking about the man who healed
[58:06] the blind who healed the who opened
[58:08] blinded eyes healed the sick raised the
[58:11] dead he done it to himself
[58:15] that is evidence of a sealed power of
[58:19] God the power of the Resurrection
[58:21] justifies us
[58:25] connected
[58:27] with Jesus Christ
[58:30] the power of the Resurrection
[58:33] is consoling comforting
[58:36] foreign
[58:38] other consolation and comfort is there
[58:40] to know when a loved one passes on
[58:44] that they knew Jesus Christ
[58:51] if you felt like they were
[58:53] thinner
[58:57] no but you want to make sure when your
[58:58] loved ones crossed over that they know
[59:00] who Jesus Christ was that they were
[59:02] saved by Jesus Christ that is the power
[59:04] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[59:07] and Paul says I want to know him in all
[59:09] this magnitude all of these Powers I
[59:11] want it and I want to own it
[59:14] but we know as Christians
[59:16] that this is not going to be an easy
[59:18] Road
[59:20] and we know as Christians many times as
[59:23] we come to this new year
[59:25] every year when this time rolls around
[59:27] we somehow try to convince ourselves
[59:30] that this year is going to be a perfect
[59:32] year
[59:35] well some of us do
[59:39] it's gonna be the best year of my life
[59:41] I hope it is
[59:43] I hope you have no
[59:45] troubles I hope you have no setbacks
[59:53] because it molds us
[59:55] it makes us it causes us to be join
[59:58] heirs with Christ the reality of
[1:00:00] everything is going to be perfect in
[1:00:01] this in this next year is a far-fetched
[1:00:04] idea because brothers and sisters
[1:00:06] knowing Jesus Paul says is knowing the
[1:00:09] fellowship of his suffering
[1:00:12] oh
[1:00:17] knowing the fellowship of his suffering
[1:00:22] but the Bible tells us if we're children
[1:00:25] heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with
[1:00:28] Christ we indeed suffer with him
[1:00:33] that we be glorified
[1:00:38] we get on into verse 12 and through 14
[1:00:41] and we see Paul here
[1:00:43] and he's beginning to talk about his
[1:00:45] relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:00:49] many of us think about Paul in such a
[1:00:51] way of his spiritual maturity right
[1:00:54] and we think about Paul and we think man
[1:00:57] this guy has conquered all spiritual
[1:00:59] difficulties
[1:01:01] this man's almost right here on the on
[1:01:03] the verge of near Perfection and we see
[1:01:05] him right there and but yet what did
[1:01:07] Paul say
[1:01:08] he said I'll assure you I'm not perfect
[1:01:14] Brother David said it in a song service
[1:01:16] he said Paul said I have to die
[1:01:18] what daily
[1:01:21] so that's why I say today is the first
[1:01:23] day of the rest of your life
[1:01:26] if Paul had to Die daily I for sure have
[1:01:29] to Die daily and so us as individuals we
[1:01:32] have to look at that and Paul says
[1:01:33] because I'm not perfect I press on
[1:01:37] I have to press on I realize that I have
[1:01:41] not arrived
[1:01:43] Paul says we're not there yet
[1:01:45] as much as we love it as much as we love
[1:01:48] this feeling it's just we love the Holy
[1:01:49] Ghost until we walk through those
[1:01:51] streets of gold
[1:01:53] we have not arrived
[1:01:56] and therefore I have to Die daily and
[1:01:59] I'm going to have to keep pressing on
[1:02:01] because Paul says listen to this Paul
[1:02:03] says I'm going to put my hands through
[1:02:04] the plow and I'm going to refuse to look
[1:02:06] back
[1:02:08] I'm going to keep pressing on
[1:02:13] many times I think we wake up and and we
[1:02:16] pray and we get down and before God when
[1:02:18] we wake up and say God this is what I I
[1:02:20] want today
[1:02:22] but I think maybe we should rephrase
[1:02:24] that when we get down and pray and say
[1:02:26] God what do you want today
[1:02:29] you see the difference in the context
[1:02:32] because in our minds we tell ourselves
[1:02:34] as Christians that we want to do what
[1:02:36] God wants to do but God this is the way
[1:02:38] we want to do it
[1:02:42] we want our businesses to be so
[1:02:45] successful so that we can give here and
[1:02:47] we can give there and we can do this and
[1:02:48] we can do that
[1:02:53] but I think the correct approach is God
[1:02:55] what do you want to do today what do you
[1:02:58] want me to do with my business today
[1:03:00] where do you want me to invest my money
[1:03:02] today where do you want me to go witness
[1:03:04] today where do you want me to do today
[1:03:06] what Can I Do Lord to further your
[1:03:09] kingdom
[1:03:10] that's our goal in this new year
[1:03:13] man this church here has been on fire
[1:03:15] have you noticed
[1:03:17] the church hears there's been something
[1:03:19] there's been a movement going on in the
[1:03:21] church here and people has been getting
[1:03:23] excited about the word of God
[1:03:25] why is that it's because we're in a late
[1:03:28] hour and God is calling out to his bride
[1:03:30] and he's trying to get her ready and
[1:03:33] he's trying to alert her to the hour
[1:03:35] we're living in and his power and his
[1:03:37] demonstration and His holy spirit is
[1:03:39] moving amongst the people let me tell
[1:03:41] you it's okay to Cloud brother Tommy
[1:03:43] it's okay to shout it's okay to speak in
[1:03:46] tongues
[1:03:48] it's okay to do these things
[1:03:57] Paul Begins the verse
[1:03:59] with the idea
[1:04:04] that Jesus Christ had laid hold of him
[1:04:09] sometimes we
[1:04:11] get it in our minds that Jesus has got a
[1:04:13] hold of me I'm a Christian and that's it
[1:04:18] no it's so much more than that
[1:04:20] Jesus has a hope to Paul and why does it
[1:04:24] say that why did it why did Paul say
[1:04:26] that he wanted he wanted Jesus to have
[1:04:28] it lay a hole to him and him lay a hole
[1:04:30] of Jesus why did Paul say that Jesus
[1:04:33] laid a hold of Paul to make him a new
[1:04:35] man
[1:04:36] do you realize that Jesus got to hold
[1:04:38] them and said Paul I'm going to make you
[1:04:39] a new man he did that so that Paul would
[1:04:42] lay a hold to that and see what the
[1:04:44] converting power of God was all about
[1:04:49] Jesus laid a hold to Paul
[1:04:52] to confront to conform and to him the
[1:04:55] image of Jesus Christ
[1:04:58] so that Paul could lay a hold of them
[1:05:00] and wanted to see the nature of Jesus
[1:05:02] Christ within him
[1:05:07] you see you can't have a hotel one and
[1:05:10] the other night I have a hope to view
[1:05:13] if you want a strong bond it takes two
[1:05:19] if Jesus can hold on to me as tight as
[1:05:21] he wants but if I'm not looking to hold
[1:05:23] on to him
[1:05:25] I'm not giving him a chance
[1:05:28] he's not going to let me go if I'm one
[1:05:30] of his he's not going to let me go he
[1:05:32] didn't teach us to swim to watch us
[1:05:33] drown you know the song
[1:05:35] but it works out so much better if
[1:05:38] you're locked hand and hand and
[1:05:40] everything you're doing is is with God
[1:05:43] lock together hand in hand
[1:05:46] Paul was focusing on this one thing
[1:05:50] and he would not let those things which
[1:05:53] were behind him
[1:05:56] distracting
[1:06:00] because it says he pressed on for the
[1:06:02] prize
[1:06:04] and if we're not careful
[1:06:07] as believers
[1:06:09] if we're not real careful as Believers
[1:06:11] those things which are behind us
[1:06:14] distract us
[1:06:21] whether they be good or bad
[1:06:25] brother Butler talked about looking in
[1:06:26] the rearview mirror we're not going to
[1:06:27] be rearview mirrors Lookers Christians
[1:06:29] not rearview Christians
[1:06:31] there's no room for that
[1:06:33] and look at this the Apostle Paul
[1:06:37] sometimes looking
[1:06:38] in the past keeps us from what God has
[1:06:41] in store for us in the future
[1:06:46] your past experiences can place doubt in
[1:06:49] your lives
[1:06:51] let's talk about it for just a minute
[1:06:54] you prayed about something you're
[1:06:56] waiting for something to happen to take
[1:06:57] place it never takes place
[1:07:00] at least in your mind
[1:07:02] and your outlook and you're thinking it
[1:07:04] never takes place God never answers your
[1:07:06] prayers
[1:07:09] six months down the road is another
[1:07:11] incident another situation you begin to
[1:07:13] pray
[1:07:14] and you begin to pray and you're like
[1:07:16] well this will be just like last time
[1:07:21] God won't answer
[1:07:23] it works the same way with fears
[1:07:26] and anxieties
[1:07:28] and those kinds of things that hinder us
[1:07:29] if we continue to look back to the past
[1:07:31] you can let the fears of things that's
[1:07:33] happened in your past keep you from
[1:07:35] doing what God wants you to do in the
[1:07:38] future
[1:07:39] and Paul recognized this and Paul began
[1:07:41] to challenge himself as we as Christians
[1:07:44] ought to be challenged on a day-to-day
[1:07:46] basis to keep moving forward to keep
[1:07:49] walking in the faith and he says
[1:07:51] Brethren I do not count myself to be
[1:07:53] have been apprehended but one thing I do
[1:07:55] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:07:57] me and repressing toward the goal high
[1:08:01] calling for the prize of the High
[1:08:02] Calling of Christ
[1:08:04] so when Paul says he's forgetting those
[1:08:07] things which are behind him
[1:08:09] he's referring to not looking back at
[1:08:11] past relationships
[1:08:13] his memories his failures his
[1:08:16] Temptations things that distract him
[1:08:19] from that single-minded Focus
[1:08:23] single-minded Focus
[1:08:25] remember he wants to get so close to
[1:08:27] Christ he can't be looking back at the
[1:08:30] things in his life
[1:08:33] Paul gives us a an image
[1:08:37] and Paul was probably one of the
[1:08:38] greatest illustrators in the Bible
[1:08:41] he could give an illustration and a
[1:08:43] picture and paint a picture and he tells
[1:08:44] us he says I want you to think about an
[1:08:46] athlete running a race
[1:08:49] and he says this athlete has to have
[1:08:51] this under this this
[1:08:52] uncompromising determination
[1:08:55] to reach the finish line and win this
[1:08:58] race
[1:09:01] I want you to listen to the way the New
[1:09:03] Living Translation says it I know we we
[1:09:05] we read out of the King James version
[1:09:07] don't don't think I've converted but I
[1:09:09] do look at other commentaries
[1:09:12] the New Living Translation says it like
[1:09:14] this
[1:09:15] I focus on this one thing
[1:09:18] forgetting the past and looking forward
[1:09:21] to what lies ahead I press on to reach
[1:09:24] the end of this race and receive the
[1:09:26] Heavenly prize for which God through
[1:09:29] Christ
[1:09:30] calling us
[1:09:34] let me tell you
[1:09:35] brothers and sisters as we run this race
[1:09:38] Christ Jesus is your biggest fan
[1:09:45] can you just say
[1:09:48] I'm standing at the finish line
[1:09:50] and he's standing at the finish line of
[1:09:52] this race and he's saying keep running
[1:09:53] Don't Look Back press forward dig in run
[1:09:57] get go go go go don't quit don't give up
[1:10:02] that's what Christ is doing
[1:10:04] and Paul here is telling us this Paul is
[1:10:07] telling us to win this race you
[1:10:09] surrunner must dis
[1:10:11] Miss ever
[1:10:12] every distraction
[1:10:15] have you ever watched Olympic runners
[1:10:17] when they come to the line they set
[1:10:19] their feet in
[1:10:21] they take one hand put it down put this
[1:10:24] hand down and then they usually bow
[1:10:25] their head
[1:10:26] they're meditating getting their
[1:10:28] thoughts together and then they look up
[1:10:31] and that's it there is no more
[1:10:34] distractions
[1:10:35] it's like the eye of the tiger
[1:10:38] they've got a goal they've got a purpose
[1:10:40] their focus is 100 on what's happening
[1:10:43] in front of them because they know they
[1:10:45] can't look back if you ever watch a
[1:10:47] runner run and he begins to look back at
[1:10:49] the competition they'll catch him
[1:10:51] and they move so fast that they catch
[1:10:53] them in just an instant and so he says I
[1:10:56] got to forget and he says look at this
[1:10:57] Runner forget what's behind you don't be
[1:11:00] looking back
[1:11:02] looking back causes heartache
[1:11:11] you know when you run
[1:11:13] forward motion
[1:11:15] did you ever know that or did you
[1:11:17] realize that everywhere that you
[1:11:19] you move your eyes as your body tends to
[1:11:21] follow
[1:11:22] yeah watch preachers preach they turn
[1:11:24] their head they'll start walking this
[1:11:25] way if I look over here I'm coming back
[1:11:28] this way
[1:11:30] natural response to the human anatomy
[1:11:32] and physiology wherever you look
[1:11:33] wherever your head goes your body will
[1:11:36] follow I remember when I used to swim as
[1:11:39] a young person I was trying to learn how
[1:11:40] to do flips they said just tuck your
[1:11:42] head whichever way your head goes your
[1:11:44] body will will follow you know what it
[1:11:46] wasn't long I was doing front flips back
[1:11:48] flips side flips because I figured out
[1:11:50] wherever way I turned my head that's
[1:11:53] what direction I would go and Paul's
[1:11:55] saying be like this Runner don't look
[1:11:57] behind because when you're running and
[1:11:59] you're running forward if you look back
[1:12:01] oh you're slowing down
[1:12:03] we don't have time to slow down in this
[1:12:06] race we've got to keep pressing forward
[1:12:08] and that's why he says I'm pressing
[1:12:10] towards the mark of the High Calling
[1:12:13] Paul urges us to stop looking back
[1:12:18] think about the emotions of looking back
[1:12:21] and how it hinders your spiritual growth
[1:12:25] we don't want to we're not trying to
[1:12:26] rehash your past
[1:12:29] but if you're honest with yourself
[1:12:32] that's what you're when you're you're
[1:12:33] looking back and you're thinking back
[1:12:35] next thing you know uh bitterness Creeps
[1:12:38] in
[1:12:41] unforgiveness Creeps in
[1:12:46] doubts creeped in jealousy Creeps in
[1:12:50] yeah anger Creeps in Temptation creep
[1:12:54] Creeps in deceit Creeps in
[1:12:57] and the next thing you know you begin to
[1:12:58] lose this full experience of your
[1:13:00] salvation
[1:13:04] because your eyes are not on the prize
[1:13:08] foreign
[1:13:12] so I challenge you today
[1:13:14] and I ask you what will you do with this
[1:13:17] day
[1:13:19] what will you do with this day
[1:13:22] there was a man by the name of Abraham
[1:13:24] I've got several characters
[1:13:26] I don't want to bring them out and I
[1:13:28] want you to realize what he says what
[1:13:29] he's preaching in these when the
[1:13:30] prophet's preaching about these
[1:13:32] I'll bring out some high points but he
[1:13:35] said there was a man called Abraham and
[1:13:37] this man was a good man he was a just
[1:13:38] man but he said I want you to know it
[1:13:40] was just an ordinary man
[1:13:42] how many of you feel like you're just an
[1:13:44] ordinary person
[1:13:45] you're just an ordinary man or woman
[1:13:47] child and you're sitting here and you're
[1:13:49] going through life you're just an
[1:13:50] ordinary person he said that's who
[1:13:52] Abraham was you're just an ordinary
[1:13:54] person he said and Abraham one day
[1:14:00] did you hear what I said
[1:14:02] one day he said when he was out in the
[1:14:05] field he was hunting or picking berries
[1:14:06] or he was working one day he'd come out
[1:14:10] there and he said he met God
[1:14:18] one day
[1:14:20] one day changes the course
[1:14:23] of his history
[1:14:25] one day he said he met God and from that
[1:14:27] time he was changed he said he could
[1:14:30] call things that was not as though they
[1:14:31] were because he had met God he had known
[1:14:34] the minute the hour that he met God it
[1:14:36] changed him
[1:14:37] and God called him to be the father of
[1:14:40] many nations and believed God and
[1:14:42] believed his promise because he hadn't
[1:14:44] met God one day
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:49] yeah
[1:14:50] one day he says when when man meets God
[1:14:53] it changes his entire makeup
[1:14:58] let me tell you I'm talking about today
[1:15:00] I'm talking about tomorrow I'm talking
[1:15:03] about Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday
[1:15:04] and Friday we need that to be our one
[1:15:07] day
[1:15:08] the first day of the next 364 or the
[1:15:12] first day of the next day of the rest of
[1:15:14] our life
[1:15:16] and he says one day he said watch this
[1:15:18] 25 years later they were trying to
[1:15:21] disgust him
[1:15:22] and Tony said you must have believed
[1:15:25] something wrong Abraham
[1:15:27] you must have believed something wrong
[1:15:29] and it says what happened the Bible said
[1:15:32] no he got stronger and stronger all the
[1:15:37] time
[1:15:38] he said he got stronger and stronger all
[1:15:40] the time giving praise to God because he
[1:15:43] knew that God had to keep that promise a
[1:15:46] one-day event
[1:15:50] there was a man named Moses
[1:15:52] this man was trained in all the wisdom
[1:15:55] of the world
[1:15:56] had all all the theology
[1:16:00] school by the best he could teach the
[1:16:02] Egyptian Scholars about the word of God
[1:16:06] but he was a cat Howard
[1:16:11] that's your Prophet I said that I did
[1:16:15] he was a coward he said he was a coward
[1:16:17] and he was running around on the back
[1:16:19] side of the desert herding sheep for a
[1:16:21] stranger
[1:16:22] but there came a
[1:16:24] day
[1:16:29] and we give ourselves little hope of
[1:16:31] ever overcoming
[1:16:33] he said and there came a day when God
[1:16:36] met him there in a burning bush and from
[1:16:39] that time on Moses was changed because
[1:16:41] he'd met God in a burning bush and he
[1:16:44] came face to face with God so he
[1:16:46] couldn't be the same anymore
[1:16:49] when I wake up with a temper
[1:16:52] if I go before God face to face I can't
[1:16:54] be the same
[1:16:57] if you want to walk around and money
[1:16:59] grub and be be mad and angry all the
[1:17:02] time it's because you haven't been face
[1:17:04] to face with God
[1:17:05] and I don't mean ever I mean that day
[1:17:09] brothers and sisters it's my desire in
[1:17:12] 2023 to meet God on a day-to-day basis
[1:17:17] to find out that I want to meet him in
[1:17:19] the morning I want to meet him in the
[1:17:21] noon time I want to meet him in the
[1:17:22] night time I want to meet him over and
[1:17:24] over and over because I have found out
[1:17:27] we have just scratched the surface
[1:17:29] of who God is
[1:17:33] the more I study the more I realize how
[1:17:36] minute we are
[1:17:38] how little we know
[1:17:40] and how much we think we do
[1:17:45] he said didn't only change Moses listen
[1:17:49] now it didn't only change Moses but it
[1:17:51] changed Israel it changed Egypt it
[1:17:54] changed the world
[1:17:58] one day
[1:18:00] one day
[1:18:02] there was a little girl
[1:18:04] teenager
[1:18:07] she was on the road to the well one
[1:18:09] morning to get a bucket of water
[1:18:12] down there in Nazareth
[1:18:14] says she was a nice little girl she
[1:18:16] believed she had faith
[1:18:18] maybe that's your granddaughter maybe
[1:18:20] that's your daughter maybe that's your
[1:18:22] niece
[1:18:24] think about it
[1:18:26] a good little girl down there to go get
[1:18:27] a bucket of water she had Faith but what
[1:18:30] that morning
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:34] one time
[1:18:36] been raised around Church
[1:18:39] had heard the Scrolls over and over and
[1:18:41] over
[1:18:43] but that morning she met God he said and
[1:18:46] he told her something and she believed
[1:18:48] it and it changed the whole course of
[1:18:50] life for this woman and made her
[1:18:52] immortal
[1:18:56] do you see what the power of the
[1:18:57] Resurrection is
[1:18:59] do you see the power of one day can mean
[1:19:02] in your life
[1:19:04] he said that little girl he said
[1:19:09] that little her name was Mary
[1:19:12] the mother of
[1:19:17] there was a man by the name of Peter hey
[1:19:19] we're gonna hit everybody today
[1:19:21] every character every every personality
[1:19:23] you can think of why because it's us
[1:19:27] it's us today
[1:19:30] you know scriptures are being written in
[1:19:32] heaven about us isn't that amazing
[1:19:36] what will they say
[1:19:39] but every day we live is being scribed
[1:19:43] you know the prophets of our whole lives
[1:19:44] will be played back like on a big screen
[1:19:46] right
[1:19:48] well you know what I thought about that
[1:19:49] and and it just popped up one day and I
[1:19:51] got to read about this study it's not in
[1:19:54] my note so this is one of those free
[1:19:55] things
[1:19:57] but they
[1:20:00] found out I forgot what university it
[1:20:02] was but they said when a person dies
[1:20:05] they figured out that the neurons in
[1:20:07] their brain continue to be active for
[1:20:09] about 10 to 15 seconds
[1:20:11] okay so you've heard of people having
[1:20:13] near-death experiences
[1:20:15] and they've determined when these people
[1:20:17] would come out of these near-death
[1:20:19] experiences they would recount their
[1:20:21] whole life I I see myself as a child I
[1:20:24] see myself as a young adult I see myself
[1:20:26] get married I've seen my kids I've seen
[1:20:28] all of this and it lasted forever it was
[1:20:30] like I lived my whole life you know how
[1:20:32] long they were dead
[1:20:34] about 10 or 15 seconds
[1:20:38] so in 10 or 15 seconds time
[1:20:40] when you die your brain fires and your
[1:20:44] whole life flashes before you
[1:20:48] that's an amazing thought
[1:20:50] here's Peter
[1:20:53] and the prophet said he was an Old
[1:20:55] Rugged fisherman as rough as they come
[1:21:00] big old Burley bully guy he said bully
[1:21:05] this is Peter a big old bully guy
[1:21:07] probably it's just a big push of a bully
[1:21:10] rugged fella didn't care about nothing
[1:21:12] he didn't believe in hardly anything but
[1:21:14] one day he met God
[1:21:17] you see it don't matter what your Walk
[1:21:19] of Life is
[1:21:20] you can be rough and tough and rugged
[1:21:23] and think that you're the next thing
[1:21:25] next thing closest to John Wayne
[1:21:30] but if you'll ever meet God face to face
[1:21:34] he said from that time on he was changed
[1:21:37] from that time he become an apostle of
[1:21:39] Jesus Christ
[1:21:42] and we can't forget about the author of
[1:21:44] our text today Paul's written a text
[1:21:46] that's been used twice today so we can't
[1:21:49] forget about Saul of Tarsus here is a
[1:21:51] murderer of murderers
[1:21:54] oh
[1:21:55] a murderer sitting there holding the
[1:21:58] coats of murderers as they watch Stephen
[1:22:01] be
[1:22:02] stoned to death
[1:22:04] do you know how that ritual was carried
[1:22:06] out let me tell you how brutal this was
[1:22:08] and what what Saul set back and watched
[1:22:10] they would dig a hole in the ground
[1:22:13] about
[1:22:14] maybe waist deep and then have the
[1:22:17] accused get down on his knees in that
[1:22:19] hole and fill and fill the hole up with
[1:22:21] dirt around him until nothing stuck out
[1:22:23] but his
[1:22:24] chest and his head
[1:22:27] and then they commenced to beating his
[1:22:28] brains out with rocks
[1:22:31] that throws some light on the picture
[1:22:33] doesn't it
[1:22:34] and this is Saul of Tarsus this man
[1:22:36] right here the murderer of murderers and
[1:22:39] he's going down to persecute more
[1:22:40] because they're singing and shouting and
[1:22:42] having a good time in the Lord and he
[1:22:44] says this is uncalled for this is
[1:22:46] unheard of they'll be put to death
[1:22:50] but that day
[1:22:53] one day
[1:22:57] I thought it was amazing as I began to
[1:22:59] study these and look these up and read
[1:23:01] about these it was always he said
[1:23:03] but one day
[1:23:05] but one day he was on the road to
[1:23:07] Damascus where he met God and God the
[1:23:10] light of God shined about him and from
[1:23:12] that time on he was no more Saul of
[1:23:14] horses but he was Paul
[1:23:20] who the humble one
[1:23:22] the make one
[1:23:27] how does a man who is a staunch
[1:23:30] cold-hearted murderer
[1:23:33] how does that man become Meek and gentle
[1:23:36] and humble
[1:23:40] one day with God
[1:23:45] there was a leopard laying at the gates
[1:23:48] there was a leper laying at the gates
[1:23:50] and all the remedies of medicine have
[1:23:53] been used and here he laid with his
[1:23:55] hands drawn up in his little fingers all
[1:23:58] survived sores the prophet said as he
[1:24:00] sat there at the gate
[1:24:02] and he could hardly drag himself and he
[1:24:05] was so hopeless but one day he met God
[1:24:10] the power of Resurrection
[1:24:13] the power of life one day he met God
[1:24:16] coming to the gate and he fell down and
[1:24:18] worshiped him he said if thou wilt thou
[1:24:21] can make me whole
[1:24:27] if thou wilt
[1:24:29] you think how many people must have been
[1:24:31] sitting around that gate when he come
[1:24:33] through there
[1:24:35] I can only imagine many of them are
[1:24:37] sitting there saying Heal Me Heal Me
[1:24:39] heal me
[1:24:42] remember what I said and sometimes we
[1:24:44] pray I want this I want to be healed I
[1:24:46] want to be healed I want to be healed
[1:24:48] instead of saying God what do you want
[1:24:51] and here's this leper said If thy will
[1:24:55] he didn't say come heal me
[1:24:57] If thy will
[1:25:00] come and heal me
[1:25:02] from that time he said no more or less
[1:25:04] leprosy why because he met God face to
[1:25:08] face with God
[1:25:10] because a day with God can change your
[1:25:14] entire life
[1:25:15] so I ask you again what will you do with
[1:25:18] this day
[1:25:22] there's a blind man sitting by the road
[1:25:25] and the prophet said he couldn't see
[1:25:27] daylight from dark that's pretty blind
[1:25:31] so his whole life was a life of just
[1:25:34] complete utter Darkness nothing he said
[1:25:37] come up here but one day
[1:25:39] somebody come walking down the city of
[1:25:41] Jericho and when he met God from that
[1:25:43] time he could see he was healed the
[1:25:46] sight of light had broken to his eyes
[1:25:48] and he could see again that day
[1:25:52] that day
[1:25:54] there was a man
[1:25:56] tied up in Chains the chains couldn't
[1:25:59] hold him that he could break the chains
[1:26:01] with the strength of the demons that he
[1:26:02] had upon him but the prophet said that
[1:26:05] one day when he met Jesus he went right
[1:26:08] back to this country as a good
[1:26:09] Countryman went back to his house as a
[1:26:12] father and raised his family why because
[1:26:14] he met Jesus and let me tell you
[1:26:17] brothers and sisters there's not one of
[1:26:19] us sitting here that wouldn't be just as
[1:26:21] brute as he was if it wasn't for God
[1:26:23] almighty
[1:26:26] so I ask you again what will you do with
[1:26:30] this day
[1:26:31] how do we have this day how does this
[1:26:34] day come as I'm closing
[1:26:36] how do we get this day I tell you how we
[1:26:38] got this day there was a man on a day
[1:26:41] one day they took it and they began to
[1:26:44] spit up on him they began to tie him up
[1:26:47] and they scores them and they planted a
[1:26:48] crown of thorns and placed it up on his
[1:26:51] head and they spat up on his face
[1:26:54] and then he went down there and they
[1:26:56] went to the hill called gal goth and he
[1:26:58] walked up that bumpy road bumpity Bop
[1:27:00] dragging that cross and he went up to
[1:27:02] the cross of Calvary and he sat there
[1:27:04] and he cried out not my will but thine
[1:27:07] Lord
[1:27:09] he didn't say come take me off of this
[1:27:11] tree
[1:27:12] he said not my will but thine Lord why
[1:27:15] because we needed one day we needed one
[1:27:18] day when he would die on that cross go
[1:27:21] down into the pits of hell and shake the
[1:27:23] pegs of Heaven of Hell shake the pants
[1:27:26] of hell and say devil give me those keys
[1:27:29] we needed that day
[1:27:34] because without that day
[1:27:37] Our Lives mean nothing
[1:27:40] without that day
[1:27:43] we die a cold hard
[1:27:47] Sinner's death
[1:27:49] as musicians come
[1:27:52] so I ask you once again what will you do
[1:27:54] with this day
[1:27:56] and when I say this day every day
[1:28:01] I have to have it every day
[1:28:04] you have to have it every day
[1:28:07] we're not setting a resolution here
[1:28:09] we're not saying oh every day I'm going
[1:28:11] to do this or I'm going to do that
[1:28:12] because you'll fail
[1:28:15] I put it on my calendar last year I was
[1:28:18] gonna do this this and this I made it
[1:28:20] through about January the 19th I think a
[1:28:22] calendar still on my desk never flipped
[1:28:24] the first month
[1:28:29] I had a lot of good intentions
[1:28:33] but God's not worried about your new
[1:28:34] Leaf
[1:28:35] he's not worried about
[1:28:37] turning the page on that he just won't
[1:28:41] used to spend time with you face to face
[1:28:46] hand in hand as you walk through this
[1:28:48] journey
[1:28:50] this year you have purpose
[1:28:53] what will you do with this day
[1:28:55] let's stand to our feet
[1:29:04] let's just pray
[1:29:10] gracious kind Heavenly Father
[1:29:13] we're just thankful Lord
[1:29:15] that you moved on the scene tonight
[1:29:18] We Trust as we lifted your name you were
[1:29:21] pleased Lord
[1:29:23] and realizing in ourselves we're nothing
[1:29:27] and we look at ourselves and we think
[1:29:28] about Paul and Paul's desire to just
[1:29:31] know you in such a greater way that he
[1:29:34] could understand and realize and get a
[1:29:36] grasp of what the power of the
[1:29:38] Resurrection was
[1:29:42] they'll never spit on you again
[1:29:46] they'll never whoop you again
[1:29:48] they'll never stick another crown of
[1:29:50] thorns on your head again
[1:29:52] they'll never Mock You Again
[1:29:55] all many will doubt many will will make
[1:29:57] fun of many will will ridicule the
[1:30:00] Believers
[1:30:02] but the work is finished
[1:30:05] the power of the Resurrection is here
[1:30:07] for us today
[1:30:09] the power resurrection power of love and
[1:30:11] grace and mercy
[1:30:13] and forgiveness and endurance and
[1:30:16] dedication and commitment those are all
[1:30:19] Resurrection powers and Lord we just bow
