TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh oh oh so um [Music] uh uh foreign foreign so [Music] so uh so so [Music] me foreign foreign uh this morning brothers and sisters beautiful day to be in the house of god ask us all to stand please birth bread would you open us a prayer so amen children can be dismissed for sunday school ask us open our bibles to first john 5. we're going to read verses 1 through 15. that's one together be first john 5. whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and everyone that loveth them that beget loveth him also that is begotten of him for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son and this is the record that god hath given up to us eternal life and this life is in his son these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that you have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god last one together and if we know that he hear us whoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him brother brian you can all be seated you know after reading those 15 words you can kind of say to yourself why are you worrying if god has settled it if you return with me to second timothy again but this time to the fourth chapter uh before i get started um i was just i forgot to tell you the last time our uh our general fund is right about a thousand dollars and i have to make a deposit this week which will probably make it a little bit more than that uh and i always give you a note on the principal before i get started we have about 83 and 900 in principle left on this church and i was just thinking that's we were we've when we were in the old church before we started this new church i think we were at like 76 78 000 on the old church before we started the new church so we're getting close to that point and it shouldn't start as we get ahead i'm i don't know if we'll uh we should beat the maturity date by a year or two if we keep going the way we're going but going to timothy the second timothy the fourth chapter you know i was in my office reading a little bit praying a little bit studying a little bit and uh i was just thinking everyone here this morning i don't god knows where you're at or what state you're at this morning but i was thinking of that message brother brown i'm preaching on identification and what you see going on in the church world or in the message or out there in the world is satan himself shaking everything that he can shake so people have no boundaries anymore they don't have anything to hold their faith or you know have anything to trust anymore so when they don't have those principles anymore everything is acceptable any nothing is unacceptable anymore and that's where we're at but it shouldn't be that way for a christian this morning you should you should have a path that you're walking no matter what they're doing out there that you have a path and whatever's going wrong or going right he taught him that message and identification you can't change who you are but we're not identified out there in the world we're identified in jesus christ and all those attributes that were in christ should also be in us this morning and let me read a few of these verses but you should it shouldn't worry you this morning whatever's going on in the church world or in the world if you have that foundation that's in christ i'm not saying it's easy i i would never say that but you shouldn't be running from place to place worrying for your position because your position is in jesus christ it gives you a hope gives you a grounding and i've always said this before christian hope it's settled god has settled it you're going to be there on that day that's the hope that you have if god started the walk in you he's going to finish that walk but let me read a few of these verses i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ we shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and in his kingdom preach the word and be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke and exhort with all long suffering and doctrine and this is the fundamental for every person whether you're the the preacher of the church all the way down to the youngest person in the church paul's talking to everyone here and i i think i just read this preach the word the instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine for the time will come they will not endure sound doctrine and after their own lust shall heap to themselves teachers have an itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned to fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist and make full proof of thy ministry for i am now ready to be offered it and the time of my departure is at hand and he goes on to talk i have fought the good fight and i have finished the course and i have kept the faith and i'm gonna jump back here if you to the gospel of john here this morning you can tell i read these chapters here in the book of john a lot because my pages are coming out of my bible these uh these chapters if you turn with me to got the 16th chapter in the gospel of john so so whatever you see out there in the world whatever foundations you see being broken or far apart this morning you should have confidence as a christian that it shouldn't make a difference in you you know i don't know how else to say you know i i say this a lot can't get any it can get worse but i didn't think it'd get as bad as it's getting as quick as it's getting but then if you're looking out there for a baseline then you're going to be pretty miserable but i'll just read here i want to read the right go to the right place uh starting at about the 19th verse here and then i'm gonna jump jump to numbers the one thing i've learned in life that uh you can spend a lot of time on i'm 62 years old you can waste just your time of your life and things that really don't matter but one day you realize that you know some of the things that you spend a lot of time doing as you get closer to the end of your life they really don't mean anything the only thing that really means anything is the time that you spend alone with the lord the time that you give him is really the only thing that has any meaning in life and the age of the world that we live in is trying to separate you from that time trying to separate you from getting closer to the lord it's trying to make you get further away and i'll just read this is 19th verse and jesus knew that they were the hours to ask him and said on them do you inquire among yourselves of what i said but a little while you shall not see me and again in a little while you shall see me verily i say unto you that that you shall weep and lay and lament but the world shall rejoice and you should be sorrowful but your sorrows will be turned to joy and a woman when he was in travail have sorrow because i didn't read the women once she is in travail have sorrow because their hours come but as soon as she's delivered of trial she remembers no more the anguish for the joy that a man is born into the world and you now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice your joy no man taketh away from you and that's where i'm hoping everyone's at this morning that the joy of christ the joy of this relationship that you have with jesus christ is there abiding in you this morning and that in that day he shall ask me nothing verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he will give you you know i was just thinking in this world they do everything they can to convince you that this is impossible for the day that we live in and but that's not you know the church world the natural world they try to attack that simple fundamental that god's it's not a big daughting grandfather that so it just has no concern for what's going on in the general life but it's actually something totally different for your living father jesus christ he cares about everything that's happening in your heart and your life every day of your life everything out there in the world is trying to tell you he doesn't everything in the scripture is telling you the opposite and he does and he goes um he goes in that day she'll ask me nothing very i say unto you whosoever shall ask of the father on my name he will give it to you hereafter you've asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full these things have spoken on to you in proverbs but the time cometh one i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall show you plainly of the father and at that day you shall ask in my name and i will say unto you that will i pray and the father for you for the father himself love with you because ye have loved me and you have believed that i've come from god i've come forth from the father and i've come into the world again and i leave the world and go on the father i'm not gonna i could i know i spent a lot of time reading but the the one thought i would have this morning i'm gonna turn to here you know um is don't ever forget that your your heavenly father jesus christ himself he cares about everything aspect of your life if you have a need you need to ask him don't don't be afraid to ask for something that you know that you need and i was just gonna you know you all know i was i'm not you can tell from my accent i'm not from around here as they like to say i'm not trying to be funny but you know i was raised a catholic boy and i always wondered you know that when you used to go to church or you go around the priest before you left they'd always they'd always have this incontaction that they would talk to you from but then then i realized not wanting to get too loud here that what they were saying to you is it came out of the bible and i'm just going to read what moses told aaron to to talk to the people one thing moses told aaron and told the priest that they were continually to put the word of god upon the people you know in that day and age not everyone was as fortunate as you that could read and write so the only communication they had from the lord was when the priests or the preachers read the word and presented it to the people and i'll just read what it has to say here and it's in you don't have to turn to it but it's if you want to write it down it's in the sixth chapter of numbers and then it's after the law of the nazarites and it starts at about and about the 26th verse of the sixth chapter of numbers and it said the lord spoke to moses and speak unto aaron and unto his son saying on this wise you shall bless the children of israel saying unto them the lord bless thee and keep thee the lord make his face to shine upon thee and be graces unto thee and the lord lift up thy continents upon thee and give thee peace and they shall put my name upon the children of israel and i will bless them and you know the whole purpose of this thing is a relationship between us and jesus christ his goal for anyone here this morning including myself is to be successful not in the world but in a relationship with jesus christ and this morning anyone sitting here you have all the weapons all everything you need to be successful one thing you have to be willing to yield yourself and then what i'm holding in my hand the message of the hour and the bible you have everything you need to be there on that day this morning you don't lack anything other than having that relationship brother david hey man you love all your heart this morning hey man let's stand if we could and it's good to see each and everyone out this morning and amen but the steve's gone and sister becky and sister natalie

saturday okay amen so you hunters you can go out and hunt till about 10 30 and then it's time to come in no not really it's easy for me to say right amen so praise the lord god is good isn't he amen well we want to go on a little another uh power portion of the series um amen talking about god's attributes what god is amen and so well i tell you donna has a picture at home with all the different titles that god has and i'll tell you what he has a lot of titles amen so we want to talk about that here in a minute with the help of the lord but turn if you will with my with the turn with me if you will in the bible and we'll go to the book of first kings first kings let's go to the 18th chapter first kings 18. amen we are just been preaching on basically preaching on and about god amen and so we know that is a big subject right very big amen and so uh the all that he is god and all that he is and so this morning if you will with me on the first kings the 18th chapter and we'll begin with verse um all right i apologize go to numbers number 16 number 16. this is the story of nathan and korra nathan and cora nathan and korra actually first kings 19. first kings 18 hold on a minute if the lord be god follow him no it is right it's correct let's go with first kings first that's my second story first kings 18 forgive me okay first kings 18 and verse 19 now therefore sinned and gathered to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal 450 and the prophets of the groves 400 which eat at jezebel's table so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him and if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word and then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baal's prophets are 450 men let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under it and i will dress the other block and lay it on the wood and put no fire under it and call ye on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord for the god that answereth with fire let him be god amen and all the people answered and said it is well spoken now i'll notice here how that there is a challenge made between balaams worshipers balaams prophets and so forth on the side of jezebel and ahab and also elijah so he makes a challenge to them to find out who is god amen who is really uh the true god amen and how many knows that this what god does now elijah in verse 25 and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourself and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under and they took the bullock which was given them and addressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying obeyo hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which which was made and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them notice it's a half a day later mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or pre-adventure he sleepeth and must be awakened and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out of them and it came to pass that mid when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any answer nor any that regarded and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he prepared the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of israel or the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made the trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the blocks in pieces and laid them on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt offerings and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they it the third time and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham and of isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word hear me o lord hear me that these people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their thou has turned their back heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifices and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trenches when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is god he is the god the lord he is the god amen praise the lord can you say praise the lord this morning and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal and let not one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishron and slew them there amen may god add his blessing to the reading of the word she can be seated i title this if god be god amen if god be god amen if the lord here it says if he is lord amen then serve him why halt she between two opinions if god is god if our lord is the lord then serve him and if baal then serve him now how many remembers that when brother branham went to india he made that same challenge and while he was making that challenge he told those people in india he says now the sikhs and the jains and all of these different ones they're all basically kind of like the people are in america between the baptists and the methodists the pentecost and everybody's you know always trying to proselyte one from another and and really all it's doing is changing your ideas that's really all it's doing um but he made a challenge to him and he says you know if your god is god let him come on uh for the first night it was a death and a dumb boy that was healed he says let him come and open up his ears and let him be able to speak and of course you know the lord jesus christ the resurrected jesus christ of 2000 years ago amen came down and healed the boy but abraham said that he couldn't barely get away from the platform or whatever they had to have the militia because those indians as you know they worship anything amen everything ants insect just about anything to worship amen when they see that kind of power displayed of course spider-man said they'll grab your shoes they'll rip your clothes off of you almost and man just to touch you and so forth you know they don't really understand but you know the next night of course the blind man brother baptism says he had never made the challenge if he hadn't seen it in the vision that god was going to do it amen and he says you know basically he said if your god is god whoever's god is the real god come up and open this darn man's eyes amen now how many knows for the most part we as human beings we all follow a man amen amen in the days of john the baptist we know that they followed john the baptist and he pointed them to christ and when christ came they followed christ when paul came along he says follow me as i follow christ isn't that right so we follow the teachings of paul is that right because he was inspired of god amen because god always has a man if god would have could have chose god could have chose anything to preach the gospel he could have chose anybody to use to preach the gospel but he chose man amen so and god uses man god has his seven stars in his hands he always uses mankind amen but you know to think just just to think this morning you know that we're following a man isn't that right we follow brother branham you know awful quiet this morning not ashamed of that are you no because why because he followed the teachings of paul right follow me as i follow christ because he know he paul he preached exactly what paul preached whenever he was beyond the curtain of time and and you've got to be judged for what you've preached you'll be judged for what you've preached and he says well will paul have to be judged for what he was preached and the angel says yep he's going to have to be judged well i'll praise be to god i'll be all right because i preached just what he preached how many knows that's important because if you have paul said if an angel from heaven come and preach anything other than what we have preached in his name let him be a curse so it's very important to preach what paul preached amen but to think this morning that we follow a man that has actually god used in such a way that he used him in the same measure as god used this elijah and that right this elijah to challenge those religions back then to see who's really god and you know the thing of it is folks it's not just it didn't happen just there just think about that that deaf and dumb boy that was healed and he could speak again or the blind man who had been worshipping the son because he was taught wrong and he had and then his eyesight was restored and that was his sign that only god can do that i mean those only god can do that and just to see a blind man's eyes being restored or a death in a dumb boy being healed how many knows that's just the earnest of our resurrection if god can do something like that and restore something like that he can restore this entire body back to the way that it was supposed to be to be at the beginning amen so if god be god now we're talking about god talking about his attributes and who he really is now i just wanted to talk a little bit to start with this morning about his attributes now i'm not going to mention very many of them this morning i want to bring that picture with all of those titles of all that he is everything from he is uh he is um the alpha he's the omega he's the beginning he's the end he's uh he's the chief shepherd of our souls he's the father he's the son he's the holy ghost amen you've heard it say many times god the father god the son god the holy ghost amen and they see three gods well if every time that you made a god out of a title we'd have many many many gods huh but you know we found out that he is god the father he is god the son he is god in the form of the holy ghost it was the same god in three different offices amen and i got to thinking of how many offices how many offices just i hold or you whole just think of the titles we call them titles you know in another place the title of father a tiny little title of son hold some titles and i just wrote down here that i am a son i hold the title of being a son i hold the title of being brother i hold the title of being a cousin i hold the title of being uncle i hold the title of husband i hold the title of father i hold the title of grandfather i hold the title of carpenter i hold the title of pastor i hold the title of leader i hold the title of bishop i hold the title of being a christian what are you well i'm a christian you hold all those titles those are all things that you are as an individual but you're just one person and that's the way it is god he is just one person there's only one god i'm at least there's only one god there's not three different gods don't ever get that in your head hero israel the lord your god is one lord only one there's only one lord one faith one baptism the bible says so anytime you get three remember heathenism is to have many gods heathenism is when you have more than one god amen you know like i said thomas got that one thing right whenever he bowed down for me he said before him he says my lord and my god jesus whenever he was washing the disciples feet and so forth he says you know you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am amen i believe it was uh in matthew it talks about that they were supposed to go into all nations baptizing in them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost in acts 2 he says no assuredly that god has made this same jesus whom you have crucified he has made him both lord and christ so all three of them was jesus christ the lord father the son jesus and christ the holy ghost he's all three of them amen jesus whenever he was going to be crucified he says i lay my life down and i take it back up again you know there's one thing that we would expect of a god and that is that he could not be killed you could not kill a god but you know isn't it something that a god can actually die and then rise again that's really a god [Laughter] are you with me to think he can actually die and then raise back up again now we know the spirit left the body of jesus isn't that right amen and then jesus died or he would have never died but that spirit will never die but the body could die the spirit can never die or you'd it'd be all over with but amen so we think about that think about the father the son the holy ghost he's got all these different titles amen and you know i want to say this it's just attributes these are just things attributes that god is amen we call them many times god the father god the father he's the father of all he's the dad of all amen over in uh i believe it's in malachi let me just read it over in malachi jesus i mean god says in the old testament he says it this way a son honoreth his father and a servant his master if i then be a father where is my honor amen how many knows that you know most of us by no doubt everybody in here amen raising the message especially we are taught respect for our parents amen if you you learn it the hard way if you don't learn it quick and most of the time it takes a good licking takes a good whooping for you to learn that you don't talk to like a mama like that you don't talk to your daddy like that amen you learn respect and god says here if i am a father amen then where is my honor and if i be a master where is my reverence or my fear amen that's why i thought about this message of god be god don't you know that when you think about when you just try to comprehend god trying to comprehend who he really is because we've already mentioned some of the things that he is he has the ability he had made everything that is made everything was made was made by him amen and many times paul even paul if i remember right i believe it was in ephesians it talks about he says everything was created by him and for him without him was not anything created that was created isn't that right that's right so you know he many times he refers even yeah right here it is in colossians 1 it talks about in verse 15 who is invisible the image jesus christ was the invisible image of the invisible god he was the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers or things all things were created by him and for him amen think about your world think about everything you built you built your house you built your garage you do this you build your business you know those things you build those things that were created by you and what for you those things are yours and that's the way this whole thing is he was created by him and for him amen now notice he says and all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consists and of course he's the head of the body the church who is the beginning but the point that paul makes you find people peter also different places whenever these preachers get the preaching they talk about a god that has made everything amen how many glad to be serving because there is only one god only one true god now how many of those god means object of worship therefore there are many gods amen even the bible talks about would you choose what god you're going to sue you know what you who you're going to serve the god of baal or the god of you know the lord the lord god amen so it's the object of worship but as far as god himself and his essence there is only one true living god all else are false all else can't do anything for you i don't care if it's buddha muhammad all of that even remember brother baum says he says you know christianity is the only real religion how do you reckon that would go over in the white house right about this morning would that be uh taking everybody in no it wouldn't be it would be putting everybody out it wouldn't be very popular at all no but we're here to tell you there's only one god there's only one lord one thing all else is wrong i want to with the help of the lord this morning i want to try to emphasize on each with each and every one of us that even in the ranks all the way down to the ranks of this message you have to be careful and you've got to make sure that what you believe and the god you serve is truly the right god make sure make sure you're on the right side okay because just as i i mean just i might just uh rehearse this rather than read over there in numbers where nathan and carl rose up against moses and they say you know you're not the only holy one god works with these princes he works with these people here and he works with those people there and here you are putting yourself above us and moses when he heard it fell on his face because he knew that this was not a good thing maybe nathan thought it was a light thing hey the holy ghost works with us too huh not just you the number one huge mistake that nathan and korra made was that they've said that you put yourself above us that was a lie from the devil because moses did not put himself over those folks moses didn't even want the job but god chose him and when they spoke against god had put him like that and when god had put him like that because oh my think about when god sets something up god doesn't go in the middle of that and come fighting against that not god won't no it's always the devil that comes working and fighting against what god has already set up amen and it's a different god it might be the same name might proclaim christianity might claim to be the message but it's not god it's not truly god amen and sometimes the only way that you'll know is when god comes down and proves it and vindicates who's right and who's wrong and in every case remember this amen here these 400 prophets how did they end up dead nathan and cora in their decision are thinking they're holy too how did they end up dead why because they come against almighty god they had an idea of their own oh my and it took that moses said bring your censors do the priests work do whatever bring your senses and he says we're gonna see who god is really god or who god really has chosen is what we're gonna see amen and when they came up before the door and brought their senses god said to moses separate yourself from their company that i may consume them in a moment how many believe we got to watch every thought to go through our mind you got to make sure that you're on the right side amen you got to be make sure that you're on god's side and that god is with you because he won't be on both no he's not on both he wasn't on date and i yeah yeah you're i don't know he wasn't he's on one or the other just the same as he was with elijah and baal he wasn't them and us it's not it's not all religions together no it's not let me say something this morning you might think well what about the baptist the methodist armies the mennonite and all of the what about all of those religions what about all these other ones the very same one who challenged the buddha that seeks the chains and all of that he said if your god is god let him come up here and we'll see who it is well i didn't say a while ago was that that oh my to follow a man that almost every sermon that he preached could say now if he is still here let him come and show himself and he would come and jesus christ would come and prove himself service after service after service after service after service after service huh i'll follow something like that won't you amen to think that same prophet said baptist medicine is pentecostal even pentecostals he said they are dead he declared him dead god's not with him y'all getting quiet on me go back and listen to their tape he said they're dead how many knows i would never say that in myself i say it because they vindicated prophet said it amen i wouldn't but yet he did and guess what look at the fruits the fruits show their dad oh yeah it shows you that they're drifting further and further and further away from god all the time think about it think about that message believers we have coming way down the journey a long way now and if you aren't careful you will slowly die yourself huh you'll go the wrong direction you'll go backwards inside the front forward now i'm telling you right now i don't believe that those who are gonna be in the rapture are gonna go backwards they're gonna go forwards they're gonna keep getting closer to god preacher or no preacher inspiration no a good church or not a good church real genuine you believe they're gonna find a cornfield they're gonna find some way to get closer to god nothing will stop them because we're fixing to go on the body change folks he is the author and the finisher of our faith aren't you glad that that's one of his titles is he has begun the good work and you is able to perform it praise be to god how many believe it's important to be on god's side he was on god's side moses didn't just you know he didn't allow god just to consume him in the moon he fell down before him and then god says okay go over there and tell him whoever wants to be on your side to come away from the camp of nathan and so forth get away from their camps huh he give him a chance and don't you know what the earth began to shake everybody that decided to come over on the moses side amen they were glad that they did why because moses says if uh they die a common death then god's not with me but if some strange things happen like the earth opens up its mouth and swallows them up huh i don't know forgive me for presumptuously preaching here but i don't know that god ever told moses you tell him to tell him the earth is going to open up i don't know whether he did or not the bible probably don't say whether he did but out of moses mouth come he says if the earth opens up its mouth huh just maybe he has fun prophesied and says god i'll honor that and god got him to come to earthquake huh and shook them all right down into the hole one-way ticket straight to hell and the prophet said the hell is in the middle of the earth i was asking my wife this morning i said what is in the middle of the earth what is in the center of the earth pure love probably pure lava just hot very hot amen but think about it so you look at that and you see how that it's important that this god that is the same yesterday today and forever that you're part of it amen now notice as we talk a little bit more about this the one thing about god is he's so great god is great and the bible says greatly to be praised amen oh my this i hope this morning it'll bring a worship of our souls to know that there's such a great being out there the very essence of god like i said earlier we talked about how he's created the earth the trees he created all the animal life all of that but let's just go back a little bit perhaps before he created the earth and then you go out in astronomy and that right you go into these great big scopes i've never looked into one hopefully into the hubble space scope or whatever they call it right i'd like to look at that sometime wouldn't you to go look and they said trillions and trillions of light space now prophet taught us that those stars that you see up there all of them close together right he says and don't they say just how they know brother tommy i don't know just like i asked my wife how do they know what's down there under the earth all the way down there i highly doubt they ever got down that deep but maybe they did i don't know but anyway you look at those stars and he says you know those are so far away but yet they say that those stars are further apart from each other than we are to them talk about blowing your mind and to think the galaxies the milky white way all of the star all of that that he created all of those things that simply come off of his hand that he spoke into existence and that'll give you a little of idea of i just can't comprehend this great god how great this being is that could could do all that it's too big for our little three inch by three inch gray matter up here to comprehend absorbed even take in like i said last week i said his omnipotence all-powerful right his power is beyond our comprehension his all-knowingness is beyond our comprehension his omnipresence is beyond human comprehension amen that's why i say that it was so important in this hour that god came and proves that he's alive that he's real because most of those out there it is just too much for them to be able to believe you know can we let me tell you something on a carnal standpoint of god on a carnal standpoint of looking at god he's too big to believe and he's too evident not to believe you get that in other words he's too much to comprehend but yet it's too evident that he is not to believe it amen so you choose which one you're going to do are you going to be an atheist or you're going to believe in god you gotta do one or the other and most of them out there are atheists most of them out there don't believe god they don't they might in their mind know that there is a god somewhere because something tells them there is but as far as accepting it and believing it the way that they're supposed to and getting saved isn't that right they don't let me just let me just say something else this morning something that i the lord kind of revealed to me last week talking about having rules for your body right trying to bring this body subject and how unruly oh sinful man that i am like paul said oh wretched man that i am right just how wretched and vile and horrible this human flesh [Music] can be right and i thought about i says really all you got to do is look at early 1900s when women were allowed to wear pants right way back when they were not allowed to wear the garment they weren't allowed to wear scorched skirts they certainly weren't allowed doing no bathing suit out huh and when you look at how that's gone to debauchery to debauchery to debauchery to debauchery until now look at where it's at huh we have people in leadership i'm not sure if it's it's the head of a major thing i believe it's a four-star something in the military where it's a transgender now huh and look at the oh my and that's what think young people think about it you better have rules you better have the holy ghost you better have something to keep you right where you are to be because that's where it'll go homosexuality lesbian all the filth of the world that's how bad your flesh will go if you don't have god to control this thing that's why it's so important that you don't live by the desires of your flesh but you delivered by the power of the spirit ain't that right brother brad right let that holy ghost sons of god are led by the spirit of god amen and it'll lead you to holiness it'll bring you right make you dress right look right talk right act right love right be right the other way goes into what we see out there today horrible amen oh my let me say something else about god's this is just kind of when i get into and we won't get all the way today but we'll just go as far as we can what else what else about got the hang of stars the galaxies the solar system that we can't comprehend oh my you know i was thinking about this message and i thought about what i would say to somebody that says i don't believe there's a god there's just one question that i'd like to ask him and that is that every day and every day of the year the sun comes up at a certain time sets at a certain time do you really think that's just by chance only a stupid person would say yeah then it's time for me to go right well i say stupid okay but the bible says a fool says in their heart there is no god but in our language it's not very intelligent because there ain't no way every year not just one day just one day is enough brother toy just one day he came up at the same time or or when he was supposed to maybe a minute less right because that's why the cycle of it but they know already exactly the sunrise not only one day but one week one month year after year the solar system and the stars and hayley's comment that's going to come back in 78 years and he comes back hey guess what haley's gonna pop supposed to show it shows up you'd have to be a fool to believe that's by chance why because the bible says he created all things and by him all things consist in other words everything runs smooth because of him ain't no way ain't no way that it can be by chance ain't no way amen it can't just be by chance i think we as human beings we are always trying to be trying to see how great we can be this is where you say amen that's right we're always seeing we want the nicest car we want the nicest house we want the this that or the other huh how great you know we had a great big house uptown and i concluded i don't want a big house i want a smaller house i love my small house 900 square feet something which i knew i'd build an addition on so i'm getting a little bit more for my comfort in that right but you know it's just it just puts more on you but god is so great okay god is so great but the one thing he's a master at one thing that god is a master at that is hiding and i i don't know if i can just go to it i doubt that i can but i sure wish i could yeah here it is i was reading it yesterday it says verily thou art a god that hideth thyself he's good he is good at hiding himself i mean folks let's admit it when you look at his creation and when you look at what we just said that's not hiding it's pretty obvious right there's got to be a god somewhere he has got it's got to be i remember when i was a sinner just out there in the world and something in my heart said there's got to be a god have been amish i'd been mennonite i done done went out into the world and into sin but you know there is got to be a right way there's got to be god somewhere there's got to be a great way amen aren't you glad for that something that in there because i'll tell you what i've had buddies you know that passed away drunks never did quit drinking never did find their way always thought that it was just country music and rock and roll and whatever you know and keep going that time aren't you glad you're not in that world anymore i know brother tommy is oh my you know a lot of them perish in that that's so sad that they never really realized that there is so much more to life than that that's not what what it's all about amen that there's a god and and you could tell by the universe romans the first chapter he says being evident by the things that are made people can see that there's a god by the things that are made but yet they don't never really find him now in this church i'm sure that when i ask this question somebody's going to be able to answer me where does she hide speak up [Music] i heard somebody say simplicity that's one uh two main things that he hides himself one is simplicity and the other is humility humility and simplicity that's where he hides himself wouldn't it be nice that whenever god talks to you and whenever you have a question he just audibly speak to you like he did moses just like you're hearing my voice when i say audibly hear you that means that you literally hear a voice like this right there in your ear because remember uh you know because god spoke to miriam and aaron and so forth and he says you know i'll speak to them in a dream or a vision he speaks that way but he says moses he's special i talked to him lip to ear amen just like he did our prophet lift the ear that'd be nice that'd be nice if you could hear that but how many knows that none of us probably maybe maybe somebody here has heard him audibly a voice because most of the time it's a voice in our mind most of the time it's a voice in our heart that's what we hear why because it wouldn't take much faith for the audible would it and god wants us to operate by faith he hides himself in such a way that he did it come to god got the first belief that he is you know and that he's a rewarder of those that diligently he hides you seek how many believes that he hides you see if you want god you better go to seeking [Music] now i know we've heard that there's no man that seeks god and i realize i understand that but i can show you many many scriptures where the bible says seek him seek him seek him seek him seek him seek him seek him amen and the answer for it you want the answer for that then how does that match up how can you make that fit together you would not seek him unless he put that desire in there amen he wouldn't seek him unless he had to doubt god put that desire to in there and that's why i thought well when i sought the lord and i found god hey i was seeking the lord come to find out no that was him seeking me that was him down here drawing me no man can come unto me except my father draw him [Music] aren't you glad for that well aren't you glad to be in church amen you had a desire to be in church you know how many people don't have no desire to be in church oh my when we look at god who he is what he's done then what should we do make up our mind who we're going to serve how many believes that's the biggest thing is you got to make up your mind who you're going to serve how many knows that many many people there in the bible and joshua even talking about putting to put away those idols as your father's worship and so forth and brother baby says you know you might not think that americans are idle worshipers he says they're the big bunch of zion worship you ever saw but i the worshipers your wife can be your idol your job can be your idol your money can be your idol all kinds of idols that you can have that you put before god anything you put before god i've got the quote anything you put before god is a idol lord help us make up your mind are you going to serve this living god that is in your heart in the form of the holy ghost let me come back a little bit i'm going off my subject humility simplicity you hear he made it to where you'd have to listen real hard you might even have to pray remember brother bannon would go back in his cave for days to get a message from the lord to find out what god wanted him to do he'd go for days let me just tell you i think that's a good example if you're not getting an answer tell your wife and kids and tell whoever you have to make arrangements i'll be back when i can i'm going to go get an answer from the lord maybe you need to take a little more time to listen instead of doing all the talking and listen to what god has to tell you because i made this statement over the last couple of months real loud because that is that god wants to and does talk to us but a lot of times we aren't listening we have got too much rattling going on too many buzzing of cars and and business and cares of life and problems and stuff is going on rather than hearing what he's got to say me tell you that's something i've learned as a preacher in that you know and that is that when i'm working i feel lately i'm working a lot and everything i feel like i've got a hammer in one hand and a sword in the other that's right while i'm hammering while i'm building while i'm doing i'm also listening lord what do you have to say to me amen and when that's bill saw a voice comes and speaks something like what we're preaching about this morning just as simplicity if god be god if he really is god if he really is god then he is worthy of us giving our best to him to give our first to him to give our all to him that no matter where we're working or whatever he's always on our mind he's always in our hearts when we get up in the morning we talk to him maybe midday take time to say lord thank you for helping me through half of this day folks when i get up and i pray and i'm just so happy in the lord a lot of times and man i say lord help me to get this wall up help me to get this on help me to get that done and it just goes so much better i pick up a board because i need a certain size over here i pick up that board and i take a tape to it and it's exactly right that's it take you lord i don't even have to cut it that's how it goes oh yeah how many believe that we need to give him our own this is another scripture that came out came to me when i thought about if god is god if he really is god and he is there is such a great divine thing as almighty god who did all of that and if there is if god be god then he deserves more from us in every aspect of our life but this is the scripture that came to me in colossians 3 23 says it this way i'll just read it quick let me go back up a little bit can i so that we can encumber what he was talking about and whatsoever you do in word or indeed do all in the name of the lord jesus amen i like that because remember elijah built that altar in the name of the lord right he built it in the name of the lord whatever you do do it in the name of the lord if you can't do it in the name of the lord don't do it then in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father and the father by him i had something come in my mind as if it's okay let me back up just a little bit let me say this that there is many titles to god but there is only one name [Laughter] oh man i like that there's only one name this god with all the title has only one name the bible says it acts there there is only one name given under heaven whereby men must be saved how many believe that praise the lord now notice go back to our subject wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents if they're right or wrong or whatever no he says in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord fathers provoke not to children unto anger at least they be discouraged servants obey in all things your master according to the flesh don't you just love to have a servant that argues with you all the time huh no you don't like to have a servant that argues with the whole time obey just obey just do what you're told all right not with eye service as men pleases but in singleness of heart fearing god and whatsoever ye do do it heartily do it heartily as to the lord and not unto man so if you're gonna serve god serving heartily amen brother brahm told billy palsy it's billy paul if you're gonna be a bomb be a good one don't work a day in your life another place he says anything that's worth doing is worth doing right do it good if you're gonna do anything if you're gonna serve god save him with all your heart all of your mind follow your soul holy respect if you're gonna worship god then begin to worship him in spirit any truth amen you love it do it heartily as unto the lord not just halfway [Applause] amen now i wrote down here listen whatever you're gonna do amen if you don't love the lord why don't never darken the day of the church stars in your life if you don't love the lord because the prophet told me he says if you're filled with the holy ghost you can't hardly wait and kill them doors open why because the holy ghost wants to get him them doors because he's hungry how many knows the holy ghost feeds on many things no the holy ghost feeds on only one thing and that is the word of god that's the only thing the holy ghost feeds on eat heartily let thy soul delight itself in fatness evening my tabernacle you need to be fat now let me add a little something to you you make you feel better spiritually that's right the bible says let thy soul delight itself in fatness come unto me you who are thirsty and hungry i'll give you water and i'll give you food let your soul delight itself and happiness i want you big fat and sassy well i feel good huh that's how god wants you to be i come to give you life and more abundant he came to give you more life than walmarters have and then person next to you walking down the street that just don't have any joy don't have any peace don't have any forgiveness don't have any holiness don't have anything to live for oh my whatever you do do it heartily as unto the lord if you're gonna do something do it right do with all your heart how many believes that this morning because that's what god expects from us they'll do it all with all of our heart amen get up in the morning and pray say god i commit this dead to you lord i can't go i can't go do business i want to go on this business venture but lord if it be your will whatever your will is lord you want him to lead you him to guide you everything you do everything you said got to be the will of the lord oh my god in the middle of the day thank him again like daniel did how many knows daniel he was a he was a fat man daniel was fat he had so much of god in him the lions couldn't touch him that's right them hebrew children they had so much of god until the fire wouldn't burn amen we as christians in this laodicea edge we've got so much of god lukewarmness can't touch us amen believes god is worthy of praise he's worthy of honor in our lives can i back up just a little bit i'd start it with wives submit yourselves unto your husband remember all of this paul said whatever you're gonna do do it hardly wives if you're gonna submit yourself really submit yourself to him huh praise the lord then the very next verse is husbands love your wives right love your wives and peanut bitter against them i don't know about you but my wife has made me mad she has made me mad hey we're just being honest if y'all were honest you probably say the same thing and if you haven't it'll probably happen so when it happens remember the advice of the old preacher up here remember the bible says don't you hold it against them you forgive them huh that's right when you thought you ought to have the last word she still had the last word you had to quit just shut up let it be we getting down to where we live now huh sure i've done it be the man just shut up argument's over with then be another man be a man even a little more do it hardly all right i ain't gonna hold it against her wipe that big old frown off your face and smile and say i ain't gonna hold i ain't gonna be bitter against you huh that's right now the bible didn't say that about the wife to the husband but don't we all think it applies oh yeah vice versa amen brother father go ahead and preach it that's the truth he made me so bad one time it took me a week to get over it [Music] that's the truth amen and all the people said amen that's the truth that's right children obey your parents children obey your parents do what your mom and daddy says or it'll be flip flop time it'll be ruler sick time it'll be spanking time give him a good whip and dad and tell him now thank me son huh i'm saving you another one he'll thank you he will trust me all right obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord and fathers provoke not your children unto anger at least they be discouraged servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh how many believes that lord listen he keep keeps talking about in all things because we people we have a tendency to just be so part of all i'll listen to him in this and all this god i ain't listening to him about that huh isn't that how we tend to be well i go so far but knows it in all things be obedient and whatever you do do it heartily because listen you're not really just serving that's master you're not just loving your wife or your husband the way you treat them huh it's the way you're treating the lord amen remember jesus at one place he said why do you call me master or lord and what don't do the things i tell you how many knows you can't claim him as your master and lord if you don't obey what he says amen oh i like that and whatsoever you do do it heartily as unto the lord amen biggest thing is you have to decide that this is the god that i'm going to serve not the god of yesterday but the god of today amen let me let me say something in closing here i'd like to talk about worship just a little bit yet you love him let's go to that let's just go to that over in in in psalms these i love these these last three chapters of psalms when we think about how awesome and greedy god is and you've accepted his blood you've accepted the forgiveness of your sins you've received him in your heart you have the baptism of the holy ghost you've got a checkbook in your hand everything that you have need of if you need anything just write the check are you with me this morning that's the kind of god that we serve that whatever you have need of he supplied all these things in christ jesus for us we're going down through life we have the peace of god in our hearts so what is it left to do hey man i was talking to david beachy brother woody dad talking to him on the phone he was talking about an old deacon in his church that passed away but he always was always going on about how thankful that we ought to be for our health i don't know about you but when you're younger you eat all the chicken you can and you're not just you don't you take your health for granted a little bit right when you get older you begin to say thank you lord i've had five of my friends pass away and died this way that way i'm still going thank you jesus thank you for my health lord amen thank you that we're not in a you know a on a bed somewhere and can't get up thank you lord for our health appreciation that's what we give back to god appreciation how many believes even where he says if i'm a father where's my honor if i'm a god you know where's my worship amen he's giving us everything 148 chapter 148 of psalms talking about giving god back and i think that's one of the most terrible things that we as human beings do is when god gives so much we don't give back one of the things that broke his heart when he come was he came to his own and his own didn't even receive him we are so bad that he created all of us and we absolutely deny him having created us now i'm not us but i'm talking about the world out there we as human beings they want to deny that god created them do you see why god wants to consume in a moment and he will praise ye the lord 148 praise he the lord from the heavens praise him in the heights praise him all his angels praise him all ye hosts praise him son and moon praise him all ye stars of light praise him be heavens of heavens any waters that be above the heavens let them praise the name of the lord for he commanded and they were created amen he has also established them forever and ever and he had made a decree which shall not pass i like that in other words he told them what to do and that's what they do amen praise you the lord from the earth you dragons and all deeps fire hail snow vapers stormy wind fulfilling his word mountains and hills fruitful trees and cedars beasts and cattle i don't know about you but i got a few cattle i got a few horses whenever the first wind come down from the north and then when it was hot man they would be up under the tree and everything but when that cold wind comes up you ain't hurt a bunch of bellering and kicking their heels up then fat cows i didn't see that they could even leave that bow tall but boy they were having themselves up praising the lord time you know if you have animals you see them
