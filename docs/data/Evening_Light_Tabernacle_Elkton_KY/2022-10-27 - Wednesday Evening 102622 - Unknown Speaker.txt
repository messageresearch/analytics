praise God [Music] any man good to be in the house of the Lord tonight you love the Lord having a good week praise the Lord you can have your seats for a few minutes if you'd like I want to just kind of lay a foundation I guess before we stand for the scripture reading but I was in thinking and you know pondering on what to what to speak on and what direction the church seems to be going and and you know my Ministries uh you know it's it's just uh I could go myself but as far as as what's happening right now I've been looking at what's going on in the church and we've been seeing that we've been hearing the preaching of love and grace and laying your burdens down and and uh just all these wonderful messages and brother Butler preached on prayer if you want to get closer to God you what read your Bible and pray and so you know and and I think well God what are you what are you doing what what are you you know we're going in a direction that we're we're in a different kind of Direction it seems like we've heard these things forever but it seems like we're not into the so much the the do's and the don'ts but we're more geared towards a different direction and this is just my thinking but you tell me but it seems like the thought come on my mind is worship God wants worship and uh thinking about this I was looking back and kind of looking over history and some of the different things and of the church itself back even into the 1800s and in this area and I was looking and trying to put some stuff together and tonight probably be a little slower I'm looking at the clock because I'm afraid I'll go too long I'll just warn you okay uh Brother David you just wave at me when we get close so I'm gonna try not to go along but I do Wednesday nights I feel like are the time to get in and teach you got you got to you know you got a group of people here that's hungering for the word and it's time to teach and get get closer to God and really dig into this preachers in the message and so I want to try to slow down and look at some scriptures today talking about worship and I don't want you to think oh this is another one of those Services where he's trying to get us to all sing more he's trying to get us to that's not what I'm talking about and you'll you'll find out we're looking at it in a different direction so but looking at history um I was looking you haven't heard of Peter Cartwright if you've heard the messages you've heard of Peter Cartwright I've studied on him a little bit and I'm reading a book it's uh he's called The Backwoods preacher and uh boy was he back woods uh you know he's the one brother random talked about was cleaning the windows and you all know the story the guy comes in to to tell him he can't have Revival and he says well the Lord told me to have Revival and he says well you'll have to whoop me first and he says well that's what I'll do next and so he he whooped him and saved he was saved that night the gentleman was but uh story after story after Story and I was trying to figure out about some of the forefathers like that and just a little bit of history for you Peter Cartwright was born in uh Virginia Elkton Virginia and uh he was moved when he was a young man into Logan County Kentucky so just across the border when he was a teenager his family moved and that's where his ministry took off out of Logan County just he read the book it talks about right just on the other side of uh problem thinking probably the days will area in that area somewhere in that area there into Tennessee but he would talk about back in the 1800s now at 15 years old 1800 1801 15 years old and they would have 20 000 people gathered to come to meetings 20th in Logan County in 1800 and a little more history for you the the courthouse that we have is the second oldest standing Courthouse here in Todd County and it was in 1835. so you can imagine 1800 how did 20 000 people come to these services these people were dedicated it was more than just say I'm going to go to church this Sunday it's more than just saying I'm going to be a part of this group or I'm going to go over here but they were dedicated they got together on horse and buggy and wagons and they got the word out and they spread the word and they got everybody together 20 000 people and said that the shouting and the screaming of the meetings were so loud that it could be heard from two to three miles away what kind of worship is that that's an amazing worship back then I was looking at more and I thought who are some of these big people that run campaigns A.A Allen 20 000 people would gather under a canvas tent and he would preach and they would shout and they would worship and they would praise and big things happen in these meetings Billy Graham packed out the the stadium at Texas stadium 83 000 people in attendance 12 000 young people on the outside of the stadium watching on a big screen what was that there was a desire for these people I got to see what God is doing today I want to get in there I want to get where the fire is I want to get down there and I want to see how God is going to move and I'm going to worship and I'm going to praise you take brother Brown 1952 a campaign in South Africa his largest of his Camp campaigns ever over 200 000 people meeting in one spot that's amazing these people came to worship where's the worship today one of the biggest displays I've ever witnessed in my life of worship it was a couple of weeks ago there was over a hundred and two thousand people in attendance 12 to 15 000 people outside watching on a screen the city sold out of hotel rooms 9 500 hotel rooms sold 11.6 million viewers on television what's the name of that church in Knoxville brother Joe Neyland Stadium are you with me that was one of the biggest displays of worship that I have seen you say man where are you going on this those people knew how to worship they had a goal they had a reason they had a purpose they prepared for weeks after you think what kind of services would would churches have around the world if they prepared the way that those people prepared to go to that service they prepared for weeks and days and weeks in anticipation for what was about to happen they came early to the service to meet up with fellow believers hey they even came before the doors were open they walked from miles to get to the service it didn't matter if it was going to rain snow sleet hail so where's our worshipers where's our worshipers at they dressed in their best outfits they wanted a piece of the action hey when Tennessee won that ball game they demolished the stadium they tore the goal pose down marched them out praising praising praising now you know I'm not a I'm not on people for for sports you know that you know me well enough to know that but these people's display was more than just fans they wanted a piece of this they took the goal post down carried them into the streets down to the streets threw them in the river and then they come back and said no no no go get them so in fraternity Brothers goes down and pulls the goal post back out of the river takes it back to the fraternity house they start cutting it up and sell in the little pieces because everybody wanted a piece of what they were worshiping and this collects dust on our Shelf are you with me so I want to speak tonight I'll let the worshipers arise he would stand with me we'll go into the scriptures you know they sure are going to be disappointed with Kentucky rolls in there this weekend foreign I say that to get your attention but think about this they worship something that is up and down they're number 21 weeks sixth one week three one week they get beat by the underdog they win the biggest game let me tell you my God don't lose I've got something to worship about they're worth worshiping on something that's not solid it's not absolute they don't know what's going to happen from year to year are you with me we've got a Reason To Worship turn it if you would in the book of Acts 13. 1-3 . and I also want you to hold your place in Ezekiel I'll tell you early so you can find it it kind of hides from us Ezekiel 28. save it for later the book of Acts 13 1-3 now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers Barnabas and Simon that was called Niger Lucius of Cyrene Monet which had been brought up with Herod the Tea Tree Art and Saul as they minister to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where unto I have called them and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away may the Lord add His blessings to the Ring of the word you can have your seeds so I'm going to look at two quick definitions before we get started I'm gonna look at the definition of entertain so entertaining means to provide someone with amusement or enjoyment to provide someone with amusement or enjoyment and the word worship we know it means expressing reverence and adoration for deity or God so the two totally different definitions there but worship does something for us when we completely worship God and when we dedicate ourselves before God something happens in our body the University of Utah done a study with the MRI and they notice they put these probes and all these uh things onto an MRI and they sent people to church or had church service wherever the study was and I noticed that when people were worshiping God that something happened in their brain it turned on receptors in their brain in the pre-quarter cortex of their brain and the frontal cortex neurons started firing electrodes started firing things started happening when they were worshiping and what they found out is what what turned on was the reward center so when they were worshiping God something in their body scientifically said hey you're fixing to be rewarded yeah think about that so whenever you want something from God we need to worship God because the reward is going to come they proved it time and time again that these reward was set receptors would come on like hey ding ding ding God's fixing to get back and we need God to give back so here we're looking at this church here in the book of Acts and I'm going to take my time here and I want you to look now we're looking at this church in Antioch and we see Barnabas and Saul and John Mark they were all up in the in the church in Antioch and the returning delivering a gift of support uh to the church in Jerusalem and here is Saul and Barnabas amongst these teachers and Prophets and Simon and Lucius and manea and here they are Simon I want you to notice this because we talked about him here a while back scholars believe that this Simon who was called Niger he said it was a black man so they think that it's the same Simon of Cyrene that carried the cross to Calvary you want to know the correlation this guy here is somebody special he done something for Jesus right here and so here's this Simon that carried the cross Manan it says was mentioned and he grew up with who Herod you see the contrast you got Herod here he grew up with Herod it's the same Herod that beheaded John the Baptist it's the same hair that took place in the pre-trial of Jesus Christ but these two grew up together so what happened something happened in their childhood that made them both go very different ways because one kills Jesus and one becomes a Christian and begins to serve and worship Jesus NOW Watch What Happens here as they ministered to the Lord now I've been involved in meetings before where people were ministering to others we caught ministering the preacher gets up and ministers the word we go to the sick and we minister to the needs we go to the hungry the needy whoever and you minister to them but now it says here they are ministering to the Lord let me ask you this was Jesus sick or was God sick Jesus already gone at this time this is so we're talking about God same same thing don't get me confused don't get confused on me but God almighty they're ministering to the Lord did God need help was he sick was he needy no was he poor no it says they were ministering to the Lord and that ought to be our job as any servant any Christian of God that we minister to God because when we minister to the Lord it means we're doing what pleases him it means that when we're ministering it means we're worshiping God it means we're praising God we're praying to God we're listening to God to see what he would have back to get back to us and we're beginning to honor God and we're lifting God up because when you look at the word ministering here it's different than what I'm doing right now foreign translate it's worship they Minister into the Lord and fasted so here they come to the part of the service they're before the Lord they're ministering to the lord they're fasting so this must have been something that was really really important right because we don't fast anymore well when we hear the word fast we think that there's something dire it's something to me something needed desperately needed so here are the men of God now and there's ministering to the lord they're fasting before the Lord and this is a serious situation because they're trying to figure out who will we send out to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world God we need direction from you and if more of us would take time to fall down before God and worship and minister to him in the decisions in our lives we would say that God would move on to the scene you say how do you know that well you can't be backseat drivers you got to be on the Forefront you got to be there right at God's feet minister to him and that's the way God sends back his word to his people so Watch What Happens they're ministering to the Lord and fasting and what does it say happens next the holy spirit said did you catch that the Holy Spirit said the holy spirit said that I want you to send Barnabas and Saul to do my specific work so here's these brothers all gathered together they're ministering to God they're praising God lifting up God lord we've seen all of your Mighty works we see Jesus when he walked we've seen the Miracles that's happened Lord you're awesome you're mighty you're more than we could ever ask for God but we need your guidance and the Holy Ghost said you want something from God go minister to God and ask him and he'll get back to you so many times we want to pray and we've got to pray I'm not not knocking that at all but there's more than just asking God wants more from you than just asking asking asking nothing gets under my nerves more than my kids coming to me and just asking asking asking asking has anybody ever been there can I go can I go dad can I go can I go here can I kind of counter Canada man you sound like a horse which comes to be minister to and so many times in our in our lives we have needs and we have desires that we would like to see the manifestations of God in and we'd like to see those manifestations in action and we pray and we pray and we pray and nothing happens is that because God is mad at us or he's displeased with us or he's discouraged or he's scolding you no but let me ask did you worship Him and I'm asking myself I wonder do we fall short in worshiping god with praise and honor and glory and reverence and adoration before we ask the need because let me tell you he knows everything you need the Sparrow's need for nothing the deer need for nothing anything in nature needs for nothing you need for nothing he knows what you need but he wants love he wants worship he wants adoration I'm not scolding anybody tonight because I'm trying to learn myself because I'm trying to learn how to properly worship God I want to get to a place that I'm worshiping God in such a way because if you look down through scriptures you'll find out that those people who worship God the most are the most powerful and have the most authority of Jesus and God that you could ever ask for because you are quiet tonight but I'm afraid that this world has hardened us this world that we live in has hardened us to a place we don't see those gospel meetings that I mentioned before we don't have people coming to church early to try to get a close parking spot or try to get the front row seat or or rubbing shoulders to fight through the doors hoping that you don't have your standing room only at Kneeland Stadium we put 150 people in here and we've got the greatest thing going that the world could ever ask for um but this world I'm afraid has brought us to a place that we're uncomfortable to truly worship God uncomfortable to truly worship God brothers and sisters why is that are we in a hurry ask yourself these questions are we in a hurry are you in a hurry when you come to church are you in a hurry are we worried about what the person next to us is going to think say or look at us I've never heard them say anything boy they must have had a real experience boy he can't sing are you worried or here's the one that gets me the most that I thought about the most I studied and looked into it are we not aware of his presence because I found out the more I make myself aware to take the time to slow down and don't worry what everybody thinks and notice God in his presence I was driving down the road just uh two or three days ago and I looked over my shoulder and and the little Cloud over there was blue and had one of those real bright flashes of gold and yellow well they call them brother Butler you used to call them something Chicago Sun dog years ago and it was just the prettiest thing and I just look I said Lord that's beautiful only you can do that there's not a man there's not an invention there's not a creation they could go and put that up in the sky just like you did thank you for showing that to me because God you're amazing you're the best artist I've ever seen in my life so I'm trying to get my place into a place of worship where I notice God's presence I was driving down the road yesterday going to a job that I had to go to in Owensboro and I thought Lord these leaves are more orange than I've ever seen in my life is it just me that's getting older and slowing down and thinking about this and I'm noticing it or is it always been this way because this is awesome God this is awesome and as I'm telling God that I had songs playing I I really get down in the car but I had songs playing and it just so happened that the music just fit the the scenario and tears started running down my eyes for no reason and I just couldn't quit crying I'm just like Lord You're So Good help me worship God day by day by day like that that's what I want I want that kind of worship that I feel his presence I notice his presence and I make him aware that I know he's there listen here the ram says the irreverence he said you know what it is they are not conscious of the presence of God he said the world has become so so common and religion has become so low ebbed that there's no respects that's just the way it is he said look at them soldiers we could think tonight how irrational and horrible a thing it was for them soldiers to put a rag over the face of our Lord Jesus to make fun of him being a prophet and they put the rag over his face he said how irrational is that he said they could feel no virtue because you know God was full of virtue God was full of virtue and he's just waiting for for people to recognize that virtue the woman with the issue come up to him and he touched the Hem of her garment and what did he do he turned around and said who touched me virtue has left me there was something she needed she knew he had and she began to worship him if I could just Touch the Hem of my Lord's garment and virtue left him he said like David says let me back up he says we got these five senses that we live in it's this little world of our own he said see taste here smell touch all those things he said it's our little world we live in he said but that's that wasn't a given so that we can talk contact our Earthly home he says but their senses beyond that another dimension he said and God is always present if we could just remember that so many times we get caught up we fail to remember that God is around us or has representation around us all the time he said the angels of the Lord are encamped about those that fear Him he says in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ he said in this building tonight stands a host of angels thousands of them if we could open our eyes our spiritual eyes and God would reveal to us we would probably have a heart attack well I don't know that we could handle what happens in the Unseen World around us I don't know that we can handle that because he said there's thousands of them right there and he said those angels they stayed they don't leave they stay near those and he does it makes him and the world that we cannot see our five senses doesn't contact but Jesus is here present if we could just get conscious of that I like what he says here he said remember not only here talking about in the church so many times we want to come say well I'm going to worship service I'm going to church I'm going to Worship the Lord now it's more than just coming to church to Worship the Lord he says these are these angels are camped about you all the time whether you're walking down the street he says and wherever you are you that profess to be Believers and fear the lord angels of God are moving with you wherever you are he said they watch everything you do he said they watch everything you do and everything that goes through your mind they know all about you and you must be conscious of that if we're not conscious of it then you'll act any way you know most of the stupid things I've done in my life the stupid things I've said is when I didn't stop and look around and just think to myself I'm a Christian I'm a Believer you say what does that have to do with anything because if I'm a Believer the word just told me that angels are encamped about me and that God never leaves me he's never going to stray away from me and anywhere I go so if I always tell myself I'm a Believer I shouldn't say stupid things I shouldn't say silly things because I ought to be conscious of what's going on around me amen Christopher listen this that's the very objective of these meetings that's the objective my brethren of holding my Ministry out from the denominations he said is to try to let people see that still alive and he's here to every believer to every denomination that will believe him or people in those denominations the Lord is before me and David said I shall not be moved and what we need today is Believers that in this last day says I will not be moved I don't care what people say I don't care what people think of how I worship we need Believers that says I'm not ashamed to praise God when God is there to be praised [Music] then we'll see the movement of God then we'll see the manifestations of God because Jesus said that the father is looking for people who would worship Him in spirit and in truth you know you look out into the church World here when you say the spirit and Truth the church world has changed that to praise and worship that's what they call it now praise and worship and what do they do with praise and worship now I want you to notice we call it spirit and Truth they call it praise and worship and you look at the world of what has happened with these churches they call it praise and worship they look at that as their praise and worship service as a thermometer of how hot they are and how on fire they are for God louder the music paid musicians paid singers light shows hmm but the problem is a lot of times those things don't have a real relationship or a true meaning of worship really is let me tell you if you want to see a super fast growing Church all we've got to do is talk brother Byler into putting in a light show yes you want these benches full brother bottle we need you to hire about a sixty thousand dollar song leader that graduated from from Berkeley music yeah you say oh you're just saying that I can I can prove it to you I talked to a gentleman here a while back probably the largest numbered in in numbers Church in a neighboring County I'm not going to give too much because you're liable to figure it out I said uh how many people y'all running in here now on Sunday oh about 1200. I said man y'all how many services you all have this place don't seek oh we have to have three services thinking about going to four he said yeah when when we first started he's not the pastor he's one of the music music pastors they got seven pastors on staff music Pastor child's pastors young adults pastor it just goes on and I said uh and he said yeah when we started here it was about 300. and I got to think because I'm familiar with the situation uh you know I talk a little bit about I listen I listen I kind of poked the bear and listen you know and uh and so I come to find out that this church their numbers started growing when their music department grew their music department grew they puts paid people on staff now you're going to think I'm gonna I'm joking with you here they actually put in light show dim the lights in the congregation when the band comes out when the people come out on stage and this is where it's going to get you ground effects smoke fog machines in church but it grew in numbers it grew financially they've got huge buildings got fancy cars yeah why is that it's because people want to be entertained if you're here to be entertained you're in the wrong place because we're not here to entertain anybody we're not here to enter entertain but we're here to minister to the Lord we're here to Worship the Lord I don't care if you sing off key I'd prefer you be on key but if you can't do the best you can but the problem said we feel very safe and tucked in and we feel like uh the habits of man when they feel real safe he says they forget God they're safe in their entertaining environment there's another church in Tennessee right across the border they've done the same thing I know the guy that headed up the music department they didn't have that kind of music he's a musician he had inspiration to build the music department next thing you know it's a huge platform of professional style singers yeah the best instruments that money can buy and more you can't you you don't have they can't get enough seats in that place but my question is what did the preacher preach let me go step farther with that whenever we get into a place as Believers and we get into a place in our lives when we come to the church service and we leave here and we say man that guy can preach man that guy he could sing man he could sing he's the best worship leader I've ever heard of man I tell you what that's such a good environment in that church we're missing it because it's not about how the preacher preaches it's not about how the singers sing but it's about what God is doing in the lives of his believers I want people to leave here and say God moved for sister Becky last week not because she was playing the piano but because she had failed before him and she dedicated herself and she worshiped God and God answered a prayer in her life that's the testimonies we want to see leaving here it's not about how well we sing or how good we preach it's about what is God doing in his people he said but we are free Americans we do what we want he said their pleasure craze to mine is full of tummy rot because Americans we seek and want entertainment so so bad and we have to be careful that we don't get caught up in the culture of entertainment taking precedence over worship but we need worshipers to arise I told you this wasn't going to be a standard message like we would talk about worship and seeing in it televisions and televisions and Hell phones and you know that's that's that's a that's a toothache to Satan that's nothing we need worshipers people want to take worship and say that people would worship this or that or the other I'm not talking about the things out there that can become Idols to us I'm talking about a relationship between you and God turn with me if you would to Ezekiel we have to be careful of this entertainment world because Satan is the master of entertainment and if you'll look with me here in Ezekiel 28 I think I said the wrong verse 28 or chapter 28 is where we're going you will look here let's read this and you ask how did Satan get into the place that he is so good at captivating people for entertainment how did he get and so so lifted up and such such a good Entertainer because you know we're it's easy for us as Americans This is somebody to dangle something in front of us and we just start following oh boy there's a new there's a new Instagram there's a just dangle in front of us we're just like a horse with a carrot and we begin to follow this stuff around why because Satan is an Entertainer And We crave entertainment Ezekiel 28 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus saith the Lord God thou seal us up the sum full of wisdom perfect in Beauty thou has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone thy covering sardius topaz Diamond Barrel Onyx Jasper Sapphire Emerald carbuncle and gold the worksmanship of the tablets and of the pipes was prepared in the the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that covered and I set I've set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect and thy ways from the day thou was created two iniquity found you say what does this have to do brother and sister this is talking about Satan this scripture is a direct reflection of Satan he's not talking to the king of Tyrus he's comparing into what Satan did so look at this and break it down he said you were sealed of perfection full of wisdom and beauty and perfect so we read it immediately realized this is not a human being he's talking about because this guy was in enthroned in Perfection and beauty and wisdom so here we have probably the most graphic illustration of Satan the entire Bible and many times it's overlooked watch what he says he said you were still a perfection so what does a seal mean anybody who has a seal has Authority if you've got a seal you have authority and you have authenticity this is my seal you know they would have Insignia Rings back in the old days that they would dip in they would put waxing and dip and they'd stick their seal in it and basically what this is saying is God was telling him this person that he's talking about which we know was Lucifer at the very right hand of God he had the Seal of God you were sealed in Perfection I made you a deputy to sign my documents you realize that I make you a deputy to seal my documents so you were in Eden in the garden of God that's not the king of Tyree you were in my garden so there was no human beings there at the time other than Adam and Eve and they were created so he couldn't have been this King so who else was in Eden that old serpent that old serpent so we began to look at this and we see Satan here in Ezekiel 28 it tells him he's Perfection he's wisdom he's Beauty and every precious stone was his covering you say what does that have to do with anything well you think about the children of Israel they had 12 Stones that made up the tablet of their breastplate this was royalty this was priesthood and Satan in God's presence Lucifer before he fell he owned these nine stones that was mentioned here in the Bible it says they were in God so no doubt he wore some kind of tablet more than likely of showing priesthood and he wore a ring of Insignia that said I'm at God's right hand man this guy was close this fella was real close the worksmanship of your tablets and pipes was prepared for you what's tablets Timbers like a tambourine and pipes to make what music what do we use music for entertainment worship so here when we look at this we have to be able to associate this Lucifer before the fall here he is the worship leader in heaven he is a professional Godly worship leader that stands at the very Throne of God and leads all the angels of heaven and saying holy holy holy praise you God praise you God he is the greatest worship leader that ever was in heaven and you know the rest of the story the fall and what happens when he fail did it change his characteristics no so you want to know why things are so hard to overcome why entertainment is so catchy why do we get trapped with entertainment why is it people would rather go to a church that's full of smoke and mirrors and lights and and loud and fancy music rather than go to a church that is preaching solid gospel word because they are grasping for the entertainment aspect because Satan has wrapped his claws into him and said Let Me Entertain You I Will amuse your spirit you say well I don't know about that I don't know if he could do that or not what's verse 15 say it said he was perfect in his ways from the day he was created till iniquity was found in him the perfect worshiper hello sisters Satan the perfect worship leader leading worship service around the very Throne of God professional do you know why we have to be so careful what our eyes see what our ears hear how we respond to things around us who's it coming from is it something that we should be uh uh amused by or is it something we should be giving worship back to that's a good question we ought to always ask ourselves because worship is not about what the way you feel worship is not about the way I feel because let me tell you there's many many many times that I have not wanted to even open my mouth to sing I didn't feel like it but I know in my heart God is worthy and desires praise from our lips it may not have been the best effort I may not you heard me in front of the bench in front of me but I opened my mouth I tried to make an effort you say well I I I don't I don't like to sing I'm not just talking about singing worship is so much more than just singing worship is is being able to draw to lay yourself down and fall before the Lord with your eyes closed and completely meditate and dedicate your thoughts and your intents to God and lift him up and worship him he wants to be lifted up and praised brother Bob we're gonna have to make this two-part series we think of biblical worship who are you often drawn to David had something special about his style of worship what was it so different about David that always stands out to us David had what passion David was passionate about God David cared about God he was full of passion he wasn't shallow and self-serving and say oh I don't know if I'm going to go because I don't know what I can get out of it David many many times you read and you look and he'll say Lord you delivered me from my enemies when I was at my lowest death when I was in my deepest pit Lord you were the one you were there I praise you God it's easy to praise God on a mountain it's easy to worship God on the mountain but let me ask you what it feels like when you're in the valley when your enemies are encamped all about you hmm [Music] but David knew how to connect with God there was a connection there that he could look and he said no matter what betrays me no matter what comes around me no matter what Falls my way whether it's a whether it's a line whether it's a bear whether it's a giant whether it's a king that hates my guts my God is able I wonder if David ever feared a defeat because he had so much confidence and what fate I've never seen it why do we have to fear defeat we don't have to fear defeat we just need to worship God you know I had somebody make fun of me one time because I said praise God when you're in the valley he said I guess you're one of them it Praises God all the time good and bad I said yeah yeah I am it's not easy it's no fun when you're going through the valley when people sick around you or the death has just happened or you lose your job or Things Fall Apart but he's still my God he still provides my needs he's still going to take care of my family because when it all said and done you know what matters is if when that role was called if that Rapture takes place all that matters is that me and my family's there it doesn't matter what happens to me here no matter how bad it hurts and I know that's bold saying that I don't want bad on me or anybody else but life happens foreign but people come to church and they get bored it's I I don't want to ask don't raise your hands but how many has ever come and said man that was boring let me ask you did you come to worship did you come prepared did you come to worship did you come with anticipation and expectation or did you just come to another service just to be entertained say man I thought brother Byler was going to preach this morning but wasn't him at visiting minister I didn't get nothing out of service I couldn't even tell you what he preached on we get bored we get confidence in people there's a little boy riding in the car with his mother and they were just going down talking having a good time talking and they were going little boys looked at his mom and said Mom how high have you ever counted and she thought for a minute she said well really I just don't even remember counting because I just don't count for no reason and she said well do you count how high have you counted he said oh sure mom I've counted well what's the highest you've ever counted 8 397. she said hey a thousand three of you remember that number he said that's easy that's when church was over it's what you make of it it's your expectations another little boy come in he was with his dad who was a preacher and the preacher him and his little son come into the church and they walked in the back door he was the visiting Minister and he seen a box on the table back there and it said all it said was alms so the preacher pulled his billfold out and put a 20 bill in there the guy get up and preached delivered an awesome message walks out and the trustee goes over and says brother I got something for you and he he opens up the little box that says alms and he said when preachers come through we just give them whatever's in the Box and he hand him a 20 bill he said thank you I appreciate it he said we appreciate the message they got in the car and a little boy said Dad if we'd have put more in we'd have got more out but God if we would just give more to God give more praise more adoration more love and this has been going on and you can see it from the beginning of time and I'm gonna have to find a place to close here but I find it in Job chapter 38 when job is there and he's he's going through and he's telling God about all of his stuff and God looks at him and he says where were you when I lay the foundation where were you when I laid the foundation he said tell me if you know so much job who determined the dimensions of this place what supports its foundations yeah who laid the Cornerstone and what's it say next the morning Stars sang together and all the Angels shattered for joy so think about that when God was there creating and he said let there be light praise the Lord Angels everywhere begin to sing and shout Let There Be Water Let There Be animals let there be this let there be that when I lay the foundation of this very World Angels begin to worship and sing and praise because they knew I was the almighty God crazy real quick and we're gonna we're gonna get shut this down we'll pick the others up some other time you know the story about uh Jesus in chapter in John chapter four and he's the woman at the well he goes up you just rehearsing the story he knows story he goes up to her and he's talking to her trying to pick her mind a little bit and and trying to talk about a drink of water and she says you don't even have a picture and so forth you know the story and the woman comes to him and the woman says sir I perceive thou are a prophet watch the conversation she says I'm fathers worshiped in this mountain and he say that Jerusalem is a place that men ought to worship so here we are Sumerians the Samaritans they worship one way the Jews over Jerusalem they're Worship in a separate way we've got our two different beliefs here you're a prophet so tell me if you were if we worship this way and you worship that way and Jesus said unto a woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall miss Mountain or in the mountain of Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh you're with me the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him for God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth yeah it wasn't it didn't matter if you worshiped God up over the hills of Samaria it didn't matter anymore if you worship God over here in the mountains of Jerusalem those were just places eating like Tabernacle is just a place Happy Valley Church of Christ is just a place Cloverdale it's just a place what matters to God is the hour that is now upon us when you leave this place you're still worshiping you're still given to God it's not about coming to this building thank you and what we have to be careful of as I close now is it's a second lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God we can't find ourselves in a place self my whole Christian experience my whole life on a day-to-day basis is about what I can do for God and I have come to realize in my life I'm too busy I'm going to be honest and you be honest I put things in front priorities sometimes get wrong I get too busy I get in too big of a hurry I'm going here I'm going there when my number one priority is what does God want me to do what does God expect of me when I cross over that day I want him to look at me and say Well done my good and faithful servant I don't want him to say man you tried to make a lot of money man you really cater to all the people around you man you took real good care of your boss's business because I don't want to disappoint my boss there's one boss I can't disappoint that's the one I'm worried about so we're going to age that we need to let the worshipers arise let's stand our feet for the Josh musicians if you come like I said this was no way and to scold anybody we all are human we like fun just make sure fun don't become entertainment overtaken worship and I've been guilty before but ask yourself you know it's church night um it might start raining before I get home it's it's church night I had a hard day at work you know we can make up every excuse in the world but if it was if it was Junior's ball game night you put chains on your tires to get there hey I'm preaching to myself so where is our worship let's just pray Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for the day you've given us we thank you Lord for the message tonight Lord I trust it's been a blessing to the ears of the people I know it blessed My Heart Lord and I I truly feel it it has drawn me and has drawn me closer to you as I've meditated on this thought this week Lord Jesus I just want to be the I just want to be a true worshiper to you Lord I always want you to know how much I love you how much I appreciate you and I don't want my prayers just to be vain repetition Lord give me this or give me that but I want you to know how much I truly love you and I appreciate you and how much I adore you and and how how awesome you are through the good and through the bad you're still an awesome God you're a living God you're a God that has our every need our every our every thought on your heart you care so much about us that you sent your son to die for us on a cross called Calvary and Lord we worship you for that because Lord I know that through the good and through the bad the blood will never lose its power and if I can worship you and you can trust me and Trust comes through worship trust comes through a relationship trust is more than just saying I love you Lord but it's lifting you up and letting me know that I'm faithful to you God that we as Believers we're faithful to you we're committed to you we love you Lord we lift you up we know there's nothing that could replace you in our life Lord and when we recognize that and we deliver that to you father individuals one to you from lip to ear to you Lord you have no choice but to pass down your power and your Authority and Lord we want to be we're not looking for power and notoriety and authority and and a sense that the world would think but we want to know that when we when we have a a a circumstance that there's something that can take a hold because we know how we know where we stand with you father because we've delivered our heart out to you on a continual basis David was so committed to you Lord that he said he set aside seven times a day that he would Praise You seven different times isolated times that he would set aside to praise you and Lord no doubt people called upon David all the time he was no doubt a a person that that people needed to make conference with he was no doubt as a king people was constantly in his ear but he said no no no stay aside I've got to set aside time for my Lord I've got to set aside time to worship my God my deliverer my Victor because I'm nothing without my God Lord help us all make that a reality in our life Lord because lord it's our desire to be so close to you we see the time approaching the End Time Lord we see the things that's happening around us don't let us get cold make us tender make us sensitive if there's any word that I would want to be tonight it's it's sensitive to your spirit so that I can always sense your presence amen Lord Jesus we just commit the service into your hands and trust that it'll
