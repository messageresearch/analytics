wear a bright and shiny crown and when the battles over we shall wear a crown in the New Jerusalem amen aren't you looking forward to the day when this battle's over amen we know the winner of the war but we got to finish fighting these battles first so uh I I it was just kind of uh the Lord just showed this to me this morning I think brother Joe had it on uh one of his Pages or something on the Internet there but um it was a little clip there that somebody put out and it was talking about the message and and different things and it and it said don't ever think that becoming a Christian will make your life easy you're an enlisted soldier in God's Army yeah do you think about that you're an enlisted soldier in God's Army and then the next thing was the Holy Spirit will teach you how to fight aren't you thankful for the Holy Spirit tonight amen I I want to speak to you tonight and it was just fitting that that come up because uh I want to speak to you on fighting for possession fighting for possession and if you want to get your Bibles and you want to turn to the book of Deuteronomy and we'll be reading there and I've I've preached and spoke some of these thoughts before but I'm going to go a little different Direction with them so if you hear something that you hadn't heard or that you've heard in in a few months prior just uh just say well I needed to hear it again and we'll we'll keep on building on it okay so uh the prophet tells us this in in the the message preparation and I want you to listen to what he says here he says little old shamgar stood there and thought well I ain't no Soldier I don't know how to fight I don't know nothing about it and he said says but the to to you holy people I want you to know his righteous ignation got up he said I hope yours does too a little bit tonight he says get up against evil get up against that old wheelchair get up against them crutches he says what the devil stuck on them don't have to be to them no sir he says they don't belong to you so these things that the devil is putting on us they don't belong to us anyway he says Christ said should not this daughter be loosed on the Sabbath day that's been bound with the devil all these years how many wants to be loosed from any bondage that Satan can put on us it may have been years and years and years you've been fighting this battle but he says it's going to be up to you wow it's going to be up to you so let's just bow our heads before we go and read the word and and just dedicate the evening to the to the Lord here so Heavenly Father we just come before you tonight Lord thankful for the day you've given us thankful for the message this morning Lord that stirred our hearts and Lord we just ask that you would just uh just take these uh hungry hearts that are here tonight Lord and though they may be weary and tired in flesh but just energize us through the holy spirit that we could just dedicate a few minutes of our time to to fully focus on what you would have in store for us and the thought thoughts and hopefully that will encourage us and Inspire us to to fight through the weeks and the troubles ahead Lord Jesus because we are a special group of people a called out group of people the the Bride of Jesus Christ and in her is no failure so Lord we just call upon your name tonight and dedicate this service into your hands Lord and be with us now and help us to get ourselves out of the way and allow the people to pull for the needs that's upon their heart Lord and you know those needs so we just ask that you would deliver tonight in Jesus name amen amen Deuteronomy chapter 11 and I'm going to try to not to hold hold us long I know you're tired I know you you've had a good meal and and uh just just Naturally Speaking when when you eat the blood leaves your brain goes to your belly to digest the food so you get tired you get weary that's just the way our bodies work so let's just uh let's just uh set that all aside for a few minutes and let's take about 45 minutes if we could and and we'll go from there and see what happens so Deuteronomy chapter 11 that's your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them as the days of Heaven upon the Earth for if ye watch now if ye shall diligently keep all these Commandments which I command you to do them watch what he says to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways not some of his ways not the ways that you like not the ones that that are pleasing to the flesh but if you'll walk in all of his ways and to cleave unto him then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourselves wow every place every place every place where on the souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your Coast be so what the Bible is telling us here as we look at this it's telling us that if the Lord will drive out all of these nations so we could replace the word Nations there and we could put challenges battles afflictions sicknesses insecurities that's right we put all of these here and he will says he will drive all these nations before you and you shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourself so to me I'm weak where it says mightier than myself I am weak I I can't battle the devil on my own I'll just be honest and tell you I can't fight him on my own that's why I have to be filled with the Holy Ghost and the Bible tells us that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world so there is where we find ourselves now fighting and we're mightier than ourselves every place let's go on down there shall be no man can we say no devil I'm not trying to add to the word but I'm just trying to type it here there shall be no devil no sickness no desire no flesh lust of the flesh that would be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land and you shall Tre that you shall tread upon as he has said unto you so you mean to tell me tonight brothers and sisters that that God's commission here tells me that I no longer have to fear Satan but Satan should be fearing us we are enlisted soldiers we're not the ones to cow down and to back away and to say let Satan walk and run all over us but the Bible says the commission here is that he will lay the fear of you up on and the dread of you upon all of the land we say of Satan are you with me may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you can have your seats tonight so I've been preaching on this for the last couple times I had to speak at the school this last Thursday and and I'm I'm going to go a little different direction but we preached some of this at brother Luke's and and and it's just been on my heart so we're just going to stay with it and and we look here and we see the children of Israel and God is making a promise to the children of Israel after them being in bondage for over 400 years 400 years they find themselves down in the Egypt and under a pharaoh a and now all of a sudden they find themselves being getting ready to be delivered and so no doubt this was an exciting time in the in the children of Israel in their lives there was a reason why Miriam picked up the tambourine and there's a reason why she shook that tambourine there's a reason why they danced and they cheered and they shouted because they were in bondage for over four 100 years and I spoke this at the school the other day and and I was applying it to an exciting time for for students because you know students they think when they're in school they're in bondage and they're under the task Masters and so I I spoke to them and I told them listen now seniors stand up we want to recognize you so we had all the senior stand up and we clap for them and I said but you know we're happy for you you should be happy for yourself but let me tell you not all of you sitting here I said let me tell you your journey is just now beginning your journey in life is just now beginning we have three here that just finished up their real estate let me tell you their journey in life is just now beginning and so when we look at this here and we see the children of Israel they're standing in a place in a time under the rulership of pharaoh where they're making bricks day after day after day and they're laboring and in this bondage and and so as they're making these bricks we've went over it before they're waiting through the mud pits now I want you to keep in mind as we're talking about fighting for possession they're waiting in these mud pits and the these feet that they're squishing the mud with there's no possession of anything under those feet at this time they possess no Freedom they possess no Deliverance they possess no happiness they possess possess no Joy No Love they possess nothing of the goodness of God only thing under their feet is squishing mud mire clay and straw right think about it but finally God decides and tells them I'm going to make a move and God begins to to deliver the children of Israel out of this bondage now he he don't come to him and tell him now I'm going to make this easy because you know what you you children I've been watching you and and you've worked hard all these days and you've labored and you've been under this bondage and this this slavery of this Tyrant he doesn't come and say so so I'm going to just make this easy for you and and I'm gonna do all the work for you I I'm gonna do all the work for you and give you this promised land no he doesn't do that but he places them into a journey he places them into a Wilderness of Life A wilderness of life you know Wilderness can be a wild place when you're in the wilderness things can come at you from every angle when you're in the wilderness and you're in the dark and you have no light things can kind of spook you and scare you might we say but here they are on a Wilderness in life and a journey that should have taken them four or five days to go from from the Red Sea into the promised land of Canaan this five- day journey is now stretched out into 40 years are you with me 40 years now I'm not trying to enourage anybody tonight but the reality of it is we got to fight the children of Israel had to fight they had a fight ahead of them there's going to be challenges there's going to be complexes insecurities there's going to be things that we Face problems at home I don't know what it is problem your job problems in your career problems in your business you got to fight you got to fight God's promises are still there nothing changed when those children of Israel were dobbing in the mud day after day after day and treading and making brick after brick after brick even though they didn't realize it God still had a promise that would never fail your promises of God will never fail you just have to keep walking you got to keep believing you got to keep knowing that there is a promised land for you and that God will not not give up on you that he said he will be with you even in you until the end of the world but you got to fight brother Bown said let's just go forward and Conquer it that's easy to say isn't it let's just go forward and Conquer it he said remember Joshua was told every place that The Souls of your footstep that's possession he says Brothers the footstep means possession so let's just keep walking into the Promised Land Not Looking Back to see happen back there he said or what somebody else is doing but keep your eyes on Jesus you know he said if you look in the rearview mirror you're bound to wreck we shouldn't be looking back but keep going forward and keep Our Eyes Upon Jesus and he said when you keep moving on like that you get into deeper depths and higher Heights and then you're beginning to possess everything that God give you in his word thank you Lord we need the possession of Jes of what Jesus has for us but you got to fight you got to fight you can't be like that two and a half you know I talked about the two and a half before and some of you looked at me puzzled didn't really didn't know where I was going or or maybe hadn't rehearsed that story as much but the two and a half that stayed out on the outside of the river the two and a half tribes uh Gad and and Reuben and half of Manasseh when they come up to the promised lamb when they come up to the river they said you know what this looks really good over here we think we just want to stay right here because we raise cattle and the cattle love Green Grass and Moses this is the greenest grass we've ever seen so if it's okay with you we'll just take our inheritance right here brothers and sisters there ain't no place for us just to stop on the outskirts what was their problem their problem was with selfishness their problem was with selfishness that we want what we want we want to make our money we want to raise our cattle we want to see our herds and flocks to increase so we're just going to stay right here we'll still call ourselves the children of Israel we'll still call ourselves the bride of Christ are you with me but I think we'll just stay out here and linger outside of where the real where the real message is is is is taking place yeah so here was that two and a half living right there outside of the river but here we see the children of Israel come up to this River and you know God has a way of always reminding us how Mighty he is God has a way of telling us that he's the most powerful that he's omnipotent there is nothing that can stand in his way and as God standing there we look at this and the Bible tells us that it was the time of harvest and as the time of harvest this river that was normally 100t wide so we might say uh twice the length of this or the width of this building maybe the maybe from this wall to that wall 100 feet 100 foot wide river how many of you think that you could swim that if you had to your life depended on it 100 feet come on you could doggy pedal across there but now God pulls them up here to this River at the time of harvest and it's no longer 100 foot wide but now this river is a mile wide outside of its banks a mile wide outside of its banks and Joshua looks at this and he begins to think how am I going to get across this how am I going to take these people across here so that we can get into the God's Promised Land the land that he has promised every one of us is ours how am I going to get across it he didn't have a negative mind he didn't look at it and say well I I I guess we've gone as far as we can go I guess God's done healing I guess God's done delivering I guess God's done saving he's brought us up to a place that's impossible no he didn't have that attitude but he began to look at this and he he said you know what I I I don't know how we're going to do this at this very moment but I tell you one thing I remember back in the word in the scriptures in the Scrolls it was said that if we would diligently keep all of his Commandments and if we would love the Lord Our God and if we would walk in all of his ways and if we would cleave unto him he'll give us every place the so of our feet touch that's how we're going to do it we're going to walk and we're going to love we're going to cleave on to God you know that word cleave means to glue or to adhere and stick in in the Book of Genesis it's expressive to say cling so I'm going to cling to my God I'm going to hold fast to my God where other what other place in the Bible do we see an illustration similar to this we look in the Book of Ruth you look at the Book of Ruth and you see that that Naomi here's Naomi and her husband died and here she's left with two sons and and they take them wives right Ora and Ruth and so here we're going through time here and a few time a few days or a few years pass and and here's M and and and chilon I think how you say his name both of them died that's the husbands of Ruth and Ruth and orpa and now here they are they're sitting here moaning they're grieving they're lost lost their whole world's been turned upside down because of the loss of their husband and Naomi looks at her two daughter-in-laws and says each one of you need to go back to your mother's house go back to the way you used to live are you with me go back and she's telling them go back and deal with the dead deal with that deal kind let the Lord deal with you there there you can find rest there maybe you'll find you another husband surely he'll be with you go there do this and Naomi says turn turn and go go with the go there and her daughters look at this and say no we want to stay with you and again she urges them I'm too old can't you see that I even if I had a child in my womb today they would never be old enough for you to marry Go Your Own Way go back to the old ways that you used to live go back to your Gods that's what she told them go back to your gods and they lifted up their voice it says and wept again now I want you to watch and it says orpa kissed her mother-in-law oh no we could say maybe she's she's been hanging around that two and a half too long because now orpa it says in the next scripture it says that she's gone back to her people so orpa has kissed Naomi goodbye even though she has the same last name the children of Israel the same tribes lingering outside of the promised land orpa lingering outside of the what was promis for her but it says if you read on it says but Ruth what clave Ruth clave unto her Ruth onto her Ruth clinged on to her and Ruth why how could Ruth do that the prophet said that Ruth was a type of the Gentile bride so there was something that Ruth was looking through the eyes of the Bride of Jesus Christ and as she began to look through those eyes what did she say she said entreat me not to leave thee entreat me not to leave thee nor to return after following thee whether you go I'm going to go where you Lodge I'll Lodge your people shall be my people there was some something special that Ruth could see into the future she could see by a vision that I am a special person and no doubt God's got a promise for me and if he's got a promise for me he must have a kinsman redeemer for me somewhere so that back to Joshua and Joshua begins to remember those words and he says brothers and sisters we got to keep God first we got to keep God first in our lives and you know our Pastor said this morning he said you know uh his words kind of paraphrasing he said Don't expect to go in the rap rapture with filthy living is that what he said this morning how many heard that raise your hand if he was listening this morning all right now we know who wasn't but he said Don't expect to go into the rap with your filthy living Joshua looks at these people and says keep God first and sanctify your lives sanctify your lives clean up your lives clean up the life that you're living He says and watch God do wonders before us he knew God wasn't going to move on the scene live in any old way they could God is not going to answer your prayers he's not going to move on your seen if we're living any old way that we want so it's Bible says they take the Covenant of the Lord and the and the and the Ark of the Covenant and it says that they took 12 men one out of each of the tribes and as soon as the as the ark passed and the priests that were bearing it as soon as it passed into the Waters of the Jordan that the Waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from down from above and from which they stand so you got these priests and they take this Ark and they place this Ark upon their shoulders and they begin to walk they've they've cleaned their lives up they've come out of Egypt they've been in the wilderness brother Bram said that was justification sanctification and now Canaan is getting filled with the Holy Ghost and in order for them to get filled with the Holy Ghost they've G to have to put God first in their life so now these these Levi priests are carrying this Ark and they begin to carry this Ark and they're walking and they're walking and they're walking now can you imagine the feeling as they begin to reach and get up on the brink of this of this Jordan River because the Bible tells us as They Carried the ark and the people kept their eyes upon the ark the ark that was filled with Aaron's budding Rod it was filled with the Mana that they were fed with in the wilderness it was fed with the word of God the Ten Commandments and now they take this Ark which is God before them and as they step into the water the flood waters raised now it says as they stepped into that water that they stood stood there on firm dry ground I said firm dry ground I wasn't going to tell this but I'm just going to tell it again Carson he he call his I didn't call his name at the school the other day but I call his name here he decides we we drained this pond at our house and we drain the pond and the water leaves and then you know we leave it dried and they they dug it out and cleaned it out and so we we wait for it to fill back up so it's all look like it's filling up you know look good but it's it's crusty all around where the water had risen to and it's crusty and dry and I'm sitting at the house and I hear the four-wheeler about to blow a blow up I'm like what in the world is that that kid doing so I step on the back porch and I'm looking and listening and then I figure out where it's coming from so I get I I just take off walking through the woods and I'll go over there and there he is about this deep in what appeared to be dry ground the ground was crusty the ground was cratered it was crusty and here he stood about this de I said what are you doing he said I was going to drive around the pond I thought it was dry I said said don't you know his thing's been holding water for the last 50 years don't you think it's a little Mucky a little mire so here I go tring out there to try to help get it out we got the fourwheeler out he lost his boots they're still to be found but that wasn't the case with the children of Israel when they went across there it says it was heaped up on dry Ground God does the impossible God makes things happen he don't halfway do something them them feet that they used to walk in and and and tread through mud and mire and that mud squeezed up through their toes they went across there and dust puffing out under their feet so if we put God first in our lives there's no room for filthy living are you with me as long as we keep God first in our lives there's no room for filthy music filthy movies filthy thoughts filthy things to do no because why if you got God first when those things those thoughts hit you those songs hit you those movies hit you you say uh this is not pleasing because I got my Ark first I got my God first in my life the prophet says he says now Canaan doesn't represent the age of the Millennium no he says it only represents I like this the age of the Overcomer it's the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan they still killed they burned they took cities and there will be no death in the Millennium a lot of times people years ago tried to put make the canaan's land this was Heaven I don't know I don't feel like I'm in heaven but I do feel like I've been given some promises I do feel like I there there's been some Deliverance given I do feel like I can call upon the god a God our God who will give us healings I do feel like there is a God that that makes us Overcomers but I'm not in heaven I hurt too bad to be in heaven so just because we get saved and filled and filled with the Holy ghost doesn't mean that our battle's over no it's just the beginning so when the children of Israel crossed over into crossed over that River into canaan's land that's when their battles really started to begin as Holy Ghost filled Believers because brother Brown sat over in canaan's land that was the Holy Ghost and so here we are their battle's now beginning because Satan's not going to be slothful did you ever realize that if if if you're if you're happy today yeah Satan's not happy if you get delivered today he's not happy I if you find forgiveness in your heart for a brother and he knows that you've genuinely forgiven somebody boy he's going to throw it at you tomorrow why because he's not slothful in his actions he wants you to be the most miserable person that you can possibly be he don't want you to have any Joy so he throws you temptation yeah sure he does he he throws these things at you he throws you things to look at he throws you things to listen to to catch your attention you can be having the most glorious day Holy Ghost filled Bible Bible reading song singing day of your life and go into Lowe's and you'll hear something that you hadn't heard since you were 16 but what do you begin to sing uh we're here human but that's the way Satan Works he begins to throw these things at you over and over so there's your battle there's your battle right there and the prophet said what is the land promised to the New Testament believer it's the promise of the Holy Spirit he says for it shall come to pass in Joel 2:28 that I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your handmaids and Maid servants I will pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy I will will show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth and the pillars of fire and smoke and Vapor the prophet says but did you notice Joshua before they crossed over he said go into the midst of the CL camp and clean your clothes sanctify every one of you and let no man come with his wife within three days if you want to see the glory of God he said what was that he said they were getting ready to inherit a promise you see God gave Abraham the promise of the land of Palestine it was to be theirs their possession forever they was always to remain in the land we can get political right there can't we God gave the children of Israel the land of Palestine so what's a protest about I wonder how many of them protesters are pro Palestinians are are say they're Christians I'd like to know know because I'd like to know do you if you're Christians do you read your scriptures do you read your Bibles do you know what God's promised to Israel was that's free I just had to share that he said they didn't own nothing in the wilderness how many can remember a time in your life before you before you come up to the promised land before you got filled with the Holy Ghost before you gave your life to Christ that you didn't have nothing in the wilderness you were lost you didn't have no happiness you were thirsting for something but you didn't know what it was and you didn't have it and so here they were they were out there in the wilderness with nothing he said then they came into Canaan he said and when they came into Canaan then they had rights oh brothers and sisters aren't you thankful tonight that we've got rights he said we've got rights because now these rights Turn The Impossible into possible these rights turn our sicknesses into Deliverance these rights give us the the the honors and the glories that go with the servant Jesus Christ these are our rights in our Promised Land he said but you're going to have to fight for it every inch of ground you're going to have to fight for it he said get over into Canaan once brother and you'll realize where you belong what what happens when we get into Canaan brother brandom said when you get over into Canaan he said ou'll realize right then you'll watch prayer start being turning things around do you see the power of canaan's land do you see the power of the promise of Jesus Christ do you see the power of the Holy Ghost in our lives he said when you get in there you can see things turn around and you can say look here Satan this is mine how many here tonight say Satan's got a hold to something of yours maybe it's a child huh maybe it's maybe it's one of the fruits of the spirit Satan's got a hold of it but he says now when you get into canaan's land you can say look at here Satan this is mine I'm the possessor of this God gave it to me God said so so move out and move off of my [Applause] grounds and Satan's going to look at you and you know what he says he's going to say he's going to say your grounds your grounds and then you're going to have to ask yourself do I know where I stand but the prophet said yes you look at him right then and you say yes sir my grounds I have an abstract deed to it brothers and sisters the price was paid in full by the blood shed of a virgin Bor son of the Living God that we have a deed in our hands we own the title Satan move off our land he said we can serve notice to him by the Holy spir Spirit guidance that's an attorney right there now how'd you like to see that above your attorney's office Holy Spirit Guidance the law offices of the Holy Spirit guidance oh we're having fun he says now look at this notice he said this does me so good he said 'I really get to feeding he said now let your hearts loose for on to God for a few minutes and listen to this Satan is a squatter he said he don't own nothing but he's tried for 2,000 years to fuss around to say I own this or you own this and he's fussing and feuding over a property dispute that he can't win he said he's nothing more than a squatter he says because Christ became the kinsman redeemer and he redeemed all of this back to us yes he says but Satan wants to try to possess it but one of these days the fight will be over he says when the fight is over we'll be on the other side and we're hes of all that Christ ever promised us but until then we got a fight the believer today he says we're air to all these things all the spiritual blessings all the physical blessings all the blessings the bible promises man that just excites us but then the next statement but you're going to fight for every bit of it how many fighters do we have I said how many fighters do we have we can't cow down but we're going going to have to let take these words you got the promise to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing but you're going to fight you say brother brandom I need healing the promise is yours he said if you've ever going to get it it ain't going to be easy but I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan I'm not going to go up to him and say you know man you know what God promise me that I I really wish You' just let me have it back I I I really wish you would just just be nice just let's just play nice everybody on the playground going to play nice I'll let you ride the Teeter Totter if you'll give me back my joy that ain't the way it works he says you're going to have to go back and you're going to take it you got to grab a hold of it and you got to fight and you go get what he got from you you say I want my kids is hand it over Satan I want my husband hand it over Satan I want my joy hand it over Satan he says listen we're heirs give it back he said you took my child listen to this sometimes we wonder we get all all confused and and puzzled and just tore up over our children don't we okay some of you do some of you I don't know poor kids y'all come see me after church but we do we get all tore up but he says listen he said we're heirs he said if if if Satan has took your child and got her all mixed up with the wrong boy he said you just take and look at Satan and say give it back if your son he says is mixed up with the wrong girl just claim him just take it back he said I claim my children I claim my brother I claim my sister he says when Satan takes a brother and a sister out of church we should put our foot on them uh no we should hold him down no that isn't what he said he said but when they when Satan takes a brother out of the church and coaxes them to leave and go out there he said you say I'm coming after them I claim it we're heir of all things he said it's given to me I'm an heir I can claim everything that God has promised me he said it's mine he said how do you get it something something you've done no sir not something you've done it's unmerited gift God give us and it's ours it belongs to us now listen to this next statement Satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the super or the scriptural authoritive let me start that over that's a hard thing to say Satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the scriptural authoritative word with faith and say it's mine the sword the sword I said you as in listed soldiers it's time we get the sword sharp it's time we get the old Bible off the off the shelf and blow the dust off of it it's time that we start seeing the words of Deliverance in the Bible it's time we start seeing the what what uh promises that God has given us and we begin to attack Satan with the very word he tries to destroy Satan he says you take that authoritative word to him and say it's mine lay it down and I when I when I read that and it struck to me and I thought you ever seen a dog they pick up something they're not supposed to have and you say hey hey lay it down that dog will cow down and that's the way Satan is but we've got to have authority we've got to have a hold to his leash we take a hold of his choke collar and when he begins to put stuff on us we just yank that collar up a little bit grip it into his neck say now lay it down it's mine he said heavens and earth will pass away but this notice shall not we serve notice on Satan today we serve notice that every promise in this book is mine get off my property no trespassing don't come back I ain't calling a law if you're coming back I'm calling a higher authority he says yeah he says tell him tell him he says lay it down he says and that'll get him running how many wants to see Satan on the run I want to see Satan on the run then when he comes at me I just say get out of here move out of here and he runs and runs and runs why because he fears all that is before us brother Brown said yes you got that scriptural Authority because you're a Believer you get it that's what he says you're a Believer and you get it he's talking about Switzerland here and we're going to try to finish up here with this thought he's talking about over there in Switzerland he said there was a a land of Peace there was a peaceful people but back in 138 6 1386 there was an invading Army that come down into Switzerland they began to trample down all of Switzerland they were leaving everything in chaos they were burning the homes killing the children ravishing the wives killing off the young driving away their their stock and all their livelihood burning up their Farms they couldn't eat the Invaders come in and they were moving in you know that's what Satan is is an Invader he wants to take every one of the things that I just described and he was invading and here this Army was invading into Switzerland and he said they they rolled rocks up down him but there was nothing that could stop them and he said there was this little Swiss Army that had been backed up into the corner of the Plains and he said they were at the end of their Road and they knew nothing could be done nothing could be done he said and that great Army coming at them with their Spears in front of them their Pikes can you imagine looking facing that Army uh just row after row of 8ot tall Spears with big spear head the Pikes that they were coming at them with and backing them into a corner and he said there was that Swiss Army that was trying to fight with every anything they could find farm implements rocks hammers rakes and here they stood backed into the corner he said they were hopeless and helpless and everything that they had tried it failed how many's ever been there before where you felt hopeless you felt you felt helpless and hopeless and everything that you tried you've tried this way and that way and you've done it this way and that way and you've tried and tried and tried but nothing nothing happens everything fails he said there they was nothing was left but chaos and ruins well that was describes my life before God that describes me to a tea before I got filled with the Holy Ghost my life was full of ruins it was a chaos I didn't know where I was going or coming and here this little army there here their wives were going he said their children were going the nation was going everything gone and nothing could stop them and they're backed into this little place and here they are standing there and Arnold Von Winkle Reed stepped up he said Arnold Von Winkle Reed stepped up and he said men of Switzerland this day I'll give my life for Switzerland what was he doing right there what was he doing he was serving notice to the enemy he was serving notice that today I don't care what happens I don't care if it cost me my life I don't care what it is this day I'll give everything that I have for Switzerland and the prophet said they've tried everything it's failed well let me tell you I can try to do things in myself and it'll fail you can try to do things in yourself you're going to fail you can throw money at your problems you can't buy them you can throw hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars at your problems it's not going to fix it and you can just go and you can you can just keep going and going and going and it's just going to keep failing but here this young man this Arnold Von Winkle right he said he tried everything and they said what are you going to do he says I'm just just follow me and fight as the best you have in you to fight and he said he went out through there and he said he threw down everything that was in his hand he raised up his arms and he said Make Way for victory Make Way for Liberty and as he stormed into there the prophet said and the in history will tell us that he found the heaviest concentration of those Spears and he runs and he grabs a hold of all those Spears and pull pull them all into his bosom and fell upon those Spears and died but what did it do it made a way for his people it made a way for the people of Switzerland when he pulled those Spears into his into his bosom and he fell upon on them the the line collapsed and then all of his fellow soldiers said let's go he made way for Liberty he made way for Freedom he made a way for us to go forward he made a way for us to get our homes back he made a way for our families to come back he made a way for us to eat and so they break through the lines and they take over they take it over and you know I looked this up and I was studying this out and as I looked it up you know I looked and and and Wikipedia says it gives some some small facts it says and it says cause of death suicide I thought no they got that wrong cause of death sacrifice sacrifice and I thought my goodness the prophet when he brought that out and he's no wonder they said it was suicide I say it's sacrifice he said when Adam's race was backed into the corner that's us when we were backed into a corner and there was no way out there was no hope all was lost there was nothing you could do you were helpless your children were Sinners your family was falling apart he says but right back there he says one day in glory the most precious thing of Heaven stepped out before the angels of God and said this day I'll give my life for the sons of Adam he says this day I'll do something that'll break the ranks of my enemy what was God doing he was making a way he he breached the Gap he tore a hole in the enemy's line to where he says come on come on Saints come on don't step Don't step behind don't stay behind let's March through this Gap and let's take back what I've given you let's stand to our feet I was thinking I've had shamgar on my mind all week and as some musicians make their way and Prophet said there was a little old shamgar and he said there was shamgar there and no he he looked around he couldn't find nothing but his righteous indignation got up he said he couldn't find nothing he wasn't a war War but what he had in his hand was a ox go and he said those 600 Philistines those 600 Philistines come at him and they stood right there and it said he be to beat their heads in he didn't lay down and say take it again Satan it's yours no but he said he took that as his righteous ignation got up and he wanted what was rightfully his this This Is My Land This is my food this is my home these are my people this is my church these are my kids and he said he began to beat their heads in and I love it when brother Ron preaches it he said dumb devil he said don't he know one can chase a thousand he only sent 600 dumb devil you love the Lord tonight how many's going to stay in the battle how many when the road gets hard and tomorrow you hardships come your way and
