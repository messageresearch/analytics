[18:08] Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[18:11] We'll just stand this morning.
[18:14] Maybe brother Joe will open us in prayer
[18:17] this morning.
[18:22] Hel.
[19:07] relax,
[19:20] our children.
[19:30] In all reality, we don't know what
[20:06] Amen. Children can be dismissed for
[20:08] Sunday school. And if you'll go with me
[20:09] in the Psalms, we're going to Psalms
[20:13] 123. And we're going to read uh chapter
[20:16] 123 and chapter 124. They're just small
[20:18] little chapters.
[20:22] It is good to be in the house of the
[20:24] Lord this morning.
[20:26] And you know, uh,
[20:29] great Jehovah God seen seen the
[20:32] situation this morning. He's seen
[20:33] everyone that would be sitting here and
[20:35] he knows everybody's needs. Thought just
[20:38] sitting back there. I'm sure needy. I
[20:40] need him all the time. I have all kinds
[20:42] of issues and situations that come up
[20:44] and and I need the Lord every day. and
[20:47] he knows all about it and he's here to
[20:48] meet him this morning. So, we're in
[20:50] Psalms uh 12, chapter 123.
[20:56] Unto thee, lift up mine eyes, oh thou
[21:00] that dwellest in the heavens.
[21:16] Have mercy upon us, O Lord. Have mercy
[21:18] upon us, for we are exceedingly filled
[21:21] with contempt.
[21:30] If it had not been the Lord who was on
[21:32] our side, now may Israel say,
[21:41] Then they had swallowed us up quick when
[21:44] their wrath was kindled against us.
[21:52] Then the proud waters had gone over our
[21:54] soul.
[22:00] Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[22:02] snare of the fowlers. The snare is
[22:05] broken and we are escaped. Our help is
[22:08] in the name of the Lord who made heaven
[22:11] and earth. God bless. You may be seated,
[22:13] brother Brian.
[22:27] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[22:31] Hope you've all had a good week. God's
[22:33] been good to you.
[22:36] If you would turn with me to um
[22:40] I was about to say something. I know I
[22:42] do this all the time. I'm not going to
[22:44] say it. If you turn with me to
[22:46] Thessalonians,
[22:49] excuse my pronunciations. Thessalonians
[22:52] 2 chapter, second book, third chapter.
[22:56] You know, I was sitting there thinking
[22:57] this morning. We were talking in the
[22:59] back room and I was listening to a
[23:02] message from brother Brandham this
[23:05] morning. Um,
[23:11] and I was thinking the whole world we we
[23:14] say it a lot or I say it a lot that you
[23:16] know the world is a crazy place and it's
[23:18] headed to destruction one day.
[23:22] But I was thinking in the world that you
[23:24] can make an you can make a biblical
[23:27] example of what's going on in the world.
[23:30] If you go back to Genesis, then you go
[23:33] to the first five books of the Bible.
[23:35] What's in you? Human nature always wants
[23:39] to look at the backside of a nation, the
[23:42] backside of a church, the backside of a
[23:45] family or an individual. They want to
[23:47] look at the backside. They want to look
[23:48] at the faults, the things wrong. They
[23:51] look at those instead of what's good
[23:53] about it. They don't always want. And I
[23:55] was thinking, you know, the children of
[23:58] the scripture says, "Pray for the peace
[24:02] of Jerusalem." The scripture also says,
[24:05] "I will bless those that bless you and I
[24:08] will curse those that curse you." And
[24:11] you can't get away from the prophetic
[24:13] voice of God. And I was just thinking,
[24:17] you know, all the people around
[24:19] Abraham's day, did they look at his
[24:21] positives or did they look at his
[24:23] negatives? In the days of David, did
[24:26] they look at his positives or did they
[24:28] look at his negatives? And Moses and
[24:30] Abraham, you know, you think and you
[24:33] think of the current situation in the
[24:36] world. If you were to say those two half
[24:38] of the world or maybe twothirds of the
[24:40] world would go mad if you say
[24:44] that the children of Israel are God's
[24:45] people, they're the people that he chose
[24:48] from the foundation of the earth to be
[24:50] the only nation that he would deal with
[24:53] as a nation. We are a bride. We are a
[24:57] group that God deals with as
[24:58] individuals.
[25:00] And what strikes me, you can see
[25:03] the kingdoms in the world right now. You
[25:06] can see how they look at Israel. And I
[25:09] think it's no different than the
[25:10] children of Israel. It's no different
[25:11] than Moses when he was in the
[25:13] wilderness. When you deal with Moab,
[25:15] Aean, all those other nations, what did
[25:18] they look at? They looked at their
[25:19] faults. They didn't look at the promise
[25:21] that God gave that people, gave that
[25:23] nation, that they would prosper. They
[25:25] were looking at the negative, not
[25:27] realizing that God was going to keep his
[25:30] promise no matter what the circumstances
[25:32] were. And when you think of Bellum, you
[25:35] know, he couldn't curse Israel. He only
[25:37] could speak and prophesize good for the
[25:40] nation of Israel. And I was listening to
[25:42] brother Brandham this morning and I was
[25:44] he was, you know, we all count on the
[25:46] promises of God God in our life. All the
[25:49] things the good things that God does for
[25:52] us. But do we keep our promises to God?
[25:55] Do we do what God asks us to do? We
[25:58] always want God to do things for us, but
[26:01] we do we do the things that the
[26:03] scripture tell us to do for him. And a
[26:06] lot of a lot of times everyone wants
[26:08] everything and they don't want to do
[26:10] anything for it. But let me just read
[26:12] and I was just think if you look at
[26:14] Abraham's life, he made mistakes. You
[26:17] look at the nation of Israel, they make
[26:19] mistakes. But it's hard for people to
[26:22] realize that it's a promise that God
[26:24] gave that nation that they would be
[26:27] there at the end and they would be a
[26:29] nation at the end. No matter what the
[26:31] mistakes are, the promise is still on
[26:33] them this morning. So you you can't you
[26:36] can't go against those promises and and
[26:40] they're going to be there. So, I was
[26:42] just thinking of the sc uh I was just
[26:44] thinking of what brother Brandham said
[26:45] and then thinking of the scriptures this
[26:48] morning that are in the Bible and what
[26:51] brother Brandham said and what the Bible
[26:53] says will happen to bring about those
[26:55] events. We we also we know that they
[26:58] have to have those two prophet
[27:00] ministries. There's several things other
[27:02] things that still need to happen. It
[27:04] could happen tomorrow. It could happen
[27:06] tonight. But there's promises that still
[27:08] that they have as a nation that are
[27:10] still going to come to pass. Let me just
[27:13] read this here this morning. This is
[27:15] what Paul said here in this third
[27:17] chapter of 2 Thessalonians.
[27:20] Finally, brethren, pray for us. The word
[27:23] of the Lord may have free course and be
[27:26] glorified even as it with you. that we
[27:30] may delivered with unreasonable and
[27:32] wicked, excuse me, that we may be
[27:34] delivered from unreasonable and wicked
[27:36] men. For all men have not faith. And
[27:39] that's really true this morning. Not
[27:41] everyone has faith this morning. But the
[27:43] Lord is faithful who shall establish you
[27:45] and keep you from evil. So that's a
[27:47] promise this morning that he's going to
[27:49] do that for you. But God asked us to do
[27:52] things for him this morning. He asked us
[27:54] to love him, do his work for him,
[27:59] fulfill his word in our hearts and lives
[28:01] this morning. And he go, I'll finish. He
[28:04] goes, "And we have confidence the Lord
[28:05] touching you that he both do and will do
[28:08] the things which he had commanded you.
[28:11] And the Lord direct your hearts into the
[28:13] love of God and into the patient waiting
[28:15] of Christ. Now we command you, brethren,
[28:18] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[28:21] that you withdraw that you withdraw
[28:23] yourselves from every brother that
[28:24] walketh disorderly, and not after the
[28:27] tra traditions which we he received of
[28:30] us. For yourselves know how we ought to
[28:33] follow us. For we have behaved
[28:35] ourselves, excuse me, I'm not reading
[28:37] this right. For you, for yourselves know
[28:40] how we ye ought to follow us. For we
[28:43] behaved not ourselves disorderly among
[28:46] you. So Paul's basically saying, we
[28:48] followed the true word before you.
[28:50] Neither did we eat any man's bread for
[28:52] not, but wroth with labor and travail
[28:54] night and day that we may not be
[28:57] chargeable to any of you. Not because we
[28:59] have not the power but to make ourselves
[29:02] an example on to you to follow us. For
[29:05] even when we were with you, this we
[29:08] commanded you that that if you would not
[29:10] work, neither should you eat. I I mean
[29:13] that scripture you could apply that all
[29:15] across this country this morning. And it
[29:17] goes on for you here. There are some
[29:19] walk among you disorderly walking not
[29:21] after all busy buddies. Now now them
[29:25] that are such we command and exhort by
[29:28] our Lord Jesus Christ. With quietness
[29:30] they work and eat their own bread. And
[29:33] then this real I'll I won't read this
[29:36] whole chapter but I'll just finish with
[29:38] this verse. Be ye brethren, be not worry
[29:41] and welloing. And I was just listening
[29:44] to that message this morning. And
[29:46] brother Brandham is talking about
[29:50] how we're so benefited, how we're so
[29:53] blessed every day of our life, the
[29:55] things that God does for us. And he was
[29:58] also what he was trying to get to a
[30:00] point when you make a promise to God
[30:03] that you're going to do something for
[30:04] him, you need to keep it this morning.
[30:06] And he was talking about that one
[30:08] promise where he said he wouldn't he,
[30:10] you know, he wouldn't kill game for
[30:12] other people anymore. And he kept that
[30:13] promise. But you know, I've made
[30:16] promises in my own life. The things that
[30:17] I needed to do for the Lord, have I kept
[30:20] those promises? It's really important
[30:22] that we keep the promises that we that
[30:25] we have. Whatever you promise God that
[30:28] you're going to do, it's really
[30:29] important you do the things that God
[30:31] asks you to do. The promises you give
[30:33] him. You know, I don't know what those
[30:36] are. I can only speak, like I said, from
[30:38] my own life. But God gave us a lot of
[30:41] problems. You know, I I'm the God that
[30:43] health all your diseases. Several
[30:45] promises in the Bible that we live by
[30:48] this morning. But I really think, you
[30:50] know, like I was saying about the
[30:52] children of Israel, you know, in my
[30:54] life, I've come short sometimes. I've
[30:56] not always done the things I needed to
[30:58] do, but God's had grace for me that I
[31:00] can see my fault, repent of it, and do
[31:04] better the next turn around. You know,
[31:05] it just you simply all you have to do is
[31:07] turn around and go the other direction.
[31:10] You know, I had a lot of things I wanted
[31:12] to say this morning, but I I'll just
[31:14] finish with this one thought.
[31:17] even
[31:21] as we see the condition of the world
[31:24] that it's in. I don't even want to talk
[31:26] about it anymore because you can say one
[31:28] thing one day and the next day it's gone
[31:30] 10 times worse. But it just lets me know
[31:33] as a as a Christian, as a Bible
[31:36] believing Christian, how important it is
[31:39] to stay rooted and grounded in the word
[31:43] of God. not looking to my right hand,
[31:45] not looking to the left hand. I'm just
[31:47] looking forward to the cross of Jesus
[31:49] Christ. And I was what I'm really trying
[31:52] to say is
[31:55] don't look on the faults of don't look
[31:57] on the backside of people or the
[31:59] backside of things. Always look for the
[32:01] pos that's what Paul said. Always look
[32:04] for the positive in any situation that
[32:06] you're in. It's it's just human nature
[32:10] wanting to pick at people's faults. It's
[32:12] just human nature. It's wanting to see
[32:14] the worst in people and not see the best
[32:16] in people. And uh I I know the
[32:19] scriptures tell us not to be that way.
[32:21] It's we always want the positive for
[32:23] people. We always desire, you know, like
[32:26] brother Brandham say, if I'm making a
[32:28] dollar, I want my brother to make $10.
[32:31] If if I'm driving a $100 car, I want my
[32:35] brother to drive a $500 car. You always
[32:37] want God to bless people more and
[32:40] abundantly above what you're being
[32:41] blessed. And you what I'm really trying
[32:44] then you wouldn't have a coveted spirit.
[32:46] You're just desiring to see God have his
[32:50] way in the hearts and lives of your
[32:52] church. And I you know like brother
[32:54] Brandham said is you know people say as
[32:56] the times get worse it's either going to
[32:58] do two things. It's going to draw either
[33:01] people closer to each other or it's
[33:04] going to drive people apart. And a
[33:06] Christian is going to want to be closer
[33:09] to the Lord and closer to his brothers
[33:11] and sisters, not further apart. Brother
[33:14] David,
[33:27] we just uh want to make a quick
[33:28] announcement. Um, we have some uh
[33:30] pamphlets that that was uh I guess
[33:33] brother Tommy talked to brother Timothy
[33:35] Puit about them. Uh looking for some
[33:37] more tools, witnessing tools and
[33:39] pamphlets, but we did get those put into
[33:41] the library. Just wanted to let
[33:42] everybody know. Uh they're really good.
[33:45] This one here is on the original sin.
[33:47] They were written by brother Timuit. And
[33:49] so thankful for men of God who can take
[33:52] and break down this, you know, the
[33:53] scripture scripture scripture and tie it
[33:55] all together. And you know because I get
[33:57] I ask I I get asked questions a lot and
[34:00] one of the questions is is how do I tell
[34:02] people about serpent seed? How do I
[34:04] explain people about brother Brandham?
[34:06] How do I explain? Well, this is why do
[34:09] we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:10] Christ? It's not just Jesus Christ. It's
[34:13] not Christ but it's the Lord Jesus
[34:15] Christ. So it explains all that. So
[34:17] these are very good pamphlets. I want to
[34:19] make sure that you know that they're in
[34:20] the back and uh they're good tools to
[34:23] keep in your toolbox and uh we just want
[34:25] to be the what God wants us to be and
[34:28] use what he's given us. So, it's good to
[34:30] be in the house of the Lord this
[34:31] morning. Are you happy to be a
[34:33] Christian?
[34:34] Well, that's pretty weak. Are you happy
[34:37] to be a Christian? God's been good to
[34:40] us. We He's given us beautiful,
[34:41] beautiful place to come and worship and
[34:43] we just want to take our time today and
[34:45] take uh the liberty to worship God.
[34:47] Praise God. lift him up and uh serve an
[34:50] omnipotent savior who has given his
[34:52] life. He's given everything for what I
[34:54] would call the cream of the crop.
[34:56] Brother Brian, if we're looking for the
[34:57] best in people, we got the best right
[35:00] here. So, God bless you. Let's worship
[35:02] the Lord this morning.
[35:05] Let's stand this morning. I mean, God
[35:07] bless you. It's good to be in the house
[35:09] of the Lord and uh we're glad to have
[35:11] our visitors this morning. Uh Sister
[35:13] Robin, Sister Amber's with us and her
[35:16] family. We just appreciate them being
[35:18] here. And then uh I had the privilege of
[35:20] meeting Sue and Lance. They're in the
[35:23] back this morning. And we've got I think
[35:25] I figured it up. We've got like 10
[35:27] families out this morning. So I thought,
[35:29] well, I'm glad somebody come to help me
[35:31] sing this morning. So Sue and Lance,
[35:34] that means you got to sing really,
[35:35] really loud. Alrighty. Amen. Brother
[35:39] Carson, would you pull that song up this
[35:40] morning? And my hope is in the Lord this
[35:43] morning. Amen. And how many's hopes in
[35:46] the Lord this morning? Amen.
[35:49] My hope
[35:53] is in the Lord
[35:56] from this time on
[36:00] and ever more.
[36:04] Oh my hope
[36:08] is in the Lord
[36:12] forever more.
[36:14] [Music]
[36:20] I stand in all within the presence of
[36:24] the Lord.
[36:27] In whom the wisdom of the aes
[36:32] lies.
[36:35] For whom the raging of the sea
[36:40] subsides.
[36:42] A living sacrifice,
[36:47] the only source
[36:49] of life. Oh my hope.
[36:53] Yes, it's in the Lord. Yes, Lord.
[36:58] From this time on,
[37:02] forever more.
[37:05] Oh my
[37:09] is in the Lord
[37:13] forever more.
[37:20] His tender mercies come with ever rising
[37:26] sun.
[37:28] to meet the father in his brokenness.
[37:33] [Music]
[37:36] To offer healing and forgiveness,
[37:44] those who trust in him will find their
[37:48] hearts
[37:50] at rest. Oh yes, my heart.
[37:56] Oh yes, Lord.
[37:58] From this time on,
[38:03] ever more.
[38:06] Oh my
[38:10] is in the Lord
[38:14] forever more. Once again this morning.
[38:19] Oh yes. Oh my hope
[38:25] is in the Lord. Yes.
[38:28] From this time on
[38:32] forever more.
[38:36] Oh my hope
[38:40] is in the Lord
[38:44] forever more. Let's sing that second
[38:46] verse again if we could. His
[38:50] [Music]
[38:51] tender mercies come with a rising sun
[38:58] to meet
[39:01] in his brokenness.
[39:06] who offer healing and forgiveness
[39:14] and those who trust in him.
[39:21] Oh yes, my hope
[39:25] is in the Lord. Thank you Lord. From
[39:29] this time on

[39:55] second verse. It says his tender mercy

[40:08] hope is in him this morning.
[40:11] Oh, I am thine. Oh Lord, I have heard

[43:35] sea.
[43:38] And there are heights of joy that I
[43:43] cannot

[44:27] morning? God bless you. You may be
[44:28] seated. I'm sorry I kept you standing so
[44:31] long and just forgive us. Sometimes I I
[44:34] have to stand. So I just think you enjoy
[44:36] standing, too. But if if you ever feel
[44:39] like sitting down, you go ahead and sit
[44:42] down. Amen. Amen. Let's sing that song
[44:45] if we could. The springs of living water

[47:46] Oh, I'm drinking at the springs
[47:50] [Music]
[47:56] to full supply of.
[47:59] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[48:01] praise this morning. Are you thankful
[48:04] for that fountain this morning? Amen.
[48:08] Amen. Brother Daniel and brother Michael
[48:10] John and brother Paul, would you come
[48:12] take up the offering this morning? And
[48:14] like I said, we have a lot of folks out
[48:16] this morning. And uh we just want to
[48:18] pray that God will watch over them as
[48:20] they're gone. And uh also a friend of
[48:24] mine, uh Brother Truman Jackson, he
[48:26] called me yesterday morning and he asked
[48:29] me that we'd pray for him. He's been
[48:31] having some stomach issues and uh he
[48:34] goes tomorrow to they're going to run a
[48:37] he called it a camera. I guess it's a
[48:39] scope whatever they do down into his
[48:40] stomach and see what his issue is. And I
[48:44] told him that we would remember him in
[48:45] prayer and just pray that God will just
[48:47] move in a special way. And he's kind of
[48:51] nervous and we just pray that God will
[48:53] just quieten his spirit and give him a
[48:56] healing touch this morning. And also we
[48:58] want to continue remember sister Parish
[49:00] and Sister Peggy are shutins this
[49:02] morning and God bless you. I know
[49:04] they're they're streaming this morning.
[49:06] just pray that God will be with them and
[49:08] continue the many needs that we have and
[49:11] sister Janette that the Lord would
[49:12] continue to touch her body and sister
[49:14] Donna and sister Sherry and and my wife
[49:17] Janet and we just pray that God will
[49:19] just uh be with them this morning also
[49:22] and also brother Josh, sister Becky, and
[49:26] brother Steve's grandson. I just pray
[49:27] that God will continue to move in his
[49:29] life. And also uh
[49:34] my
[49:37] son text me this morning and
[49:42] he doesn't serve the Lord, but
[49:45] he he texts me and he said, "Dad, pray
[49:47] for me this morning."
[49:49] He said he needs a touch in his body
[49:52] this morning. and and I thought, Lord,
[49:57] he does need a touch in his body this
[49:59] morning. One that matters
[50:03] because, you know, if Lazarus died, but
[50:06] you know what? He died again.
[50:09] We might be healed and we might get sick
[50:11] again, but once God saves our soul,
[50:15] that's all that matters.
[50:20] So, remember Micah, my daughter Jennifer
[50:22] this morning and
[50:25] and I'm just going to be honest with
[50:26] you.
[50:29] I said, "Lord, you've blessed them. They
[50:32] both have good jobs and they both have
[50:34] plenty of money. They both do good, but
[50:36] they don't have what they really need.
[50:40] They don't have the Lord in their
[50:41] heart."
[50:43] And you know, like brother Brian said in
[50:46] Sunday school, if all we could have was
[50:48] a $100 car and they had the Lord, that's
[50:50] all that matters.
[50:52] I'd give everything I have to see him
[50:55] serve the Lord.
[50:57] That's my desire this morning because
[51:00] this world is going downhill and it's
[51:02] going downhill in heart in in a hurry
[51:05] this morning. So let's if you have a
[51:07] need on your heart, just might let it be
[51:09] known with uplifted hand. Brother Troy,
[51:11] would you stand and pray over the
[51:12] offering and these needs this morning?
[53:03] Amen. When the redeemed are gathered in
[53:06] this morning. Amen. Are you looking
[53:08] forward to that time?
[53:13] Well, I am thinking of the rapture in

[56:03] and we'll hear his invitation.

[56:32] and I will sing

[56:41] [Applause]
[56:42] Amen. Are you glad to be one of the
[56:43] redeemed? Let's stand and sing that last
[56:46] verse again if we could. Well, then the
[56:49] Savior will give orders to prepare the

[1:05:14] The voices

[1:09:04] this morning? Amen. and let's stand and
[1:09:07] pray your hearts are ready for the word
[1:09:09] this morning. Enjoyed the song service
[1:09:11] and really enjoyed the specials and just
[1:09:14] pray that God will come and speak to our
[1:09:16] hearts now. And
[1:09:19] let's just sing that little song this
[1:09:20] morning as brother Thomas comes. Here's
[1:09:23] my cup, Lord. Fill it up. Is that your
[1:09:26] desire this morning?
[1:09:29] Oh, fill my cup,
[1:09:33] Lord.
[1:09:36] I lifted
[1:09:39] up.
[1:09:44] Come and quit
[1:09:49] this thirsting
[1:09:51] of my soul.
[1:09:58] Oh bread of heaven.
[1:10:03] Oh, feed me till I want
[1:10:09] no
[1:10:11] more.
[1:10:13] Here's my cup.
[1:10:17] God bless you.
[1:10:20] Take me home. Amen.
[1:10:26] Oh, here's my cup
[1:10:30] of
[1:10:33] my lifted
[1:10:36] up
[1:10:38] Lord.
[1:10:41] Come and quench
[1:10:46] the thirsting
[1:10:48] of my soul.
[1:10:52] Oh,
[1:10:55] bread of heaven.
[1:10:58] [Music]
[1:11:00] Feed me till I want
[1:11:05] no
[1:11:07] more.

[1:11:25] Morning. It's good to be in the house of
[1:11:26] the Lord again. Amen. Always a privilege

[1:11:34] the Lord. God bless you visitors. Amen.
[1:11:37] Good to see y'all this morning. Trust.
[1:11:39] Amen. That you'll enjoy yourself in the

[1:11:49] continue on our thought. Amen. Once
[1:11:51] again, amen. Last Sunday, we spoke on
[1:11:53] the seven things that God hates. Seven
[1:11:56] things God hates over in Proverbs, I
[1:11:59] believe it was. Amen. And so,
[1:12:03] we want to kind of try to go to a little
[1:12:05] bit different direction perhaps, but
[1:12:08] it'll certainly come right off of this
[1:12:10] same amen theme, so to speak. Amen. So,
[1:12:14] amen. We want to remember better Steven
[1:12:16] L. He requested prayer this morning. So
[1:12:19] let's bow our head and talk to the
[1:12:20] author this morning Lord Jesus. We come
[1:12:23] before you father knowing Lord Jesus
[1:12:24] that all scripture was given by
[1:12:26] inspiration of God of you Lord. So and
[1:12:30] when we opened this Lord Jesus we ask
[1:12:31] God that you would help us Lord and give
[1:12:33] us the inspiration also Father to be
[1:12:36] able to minister your word to your
[1:12:37] people Father that we might go from here
[1:12:40] a better people than what we came Lord.
[1:12:43] Lord when we go out those doors Lord we
[1:12:45] wouldn't be the same as what we was when
[1:12:46] we came in. And Lord, I pray for that
[1:12:49] for each and every soul that has come
[1:12:51] into the house this morning. Lord, we
[1:12:53] may remember brother Stephen this
[1:12:54] morning. Ask God that you would just
[1:12:56] touch him in his need this morning.
[1:12:58] Lord, we know that you're the same God
[1:12:59] today, yesterday, and forever. And we
[1:13:02] believe, Lord, that you'll do something,
[1:13:03] Lord Jesus. For you said if you ask
[1:13:05] anything in my name, I would do it,
[1:13:07] Lord. Bless the meditation of our heart.
[1:13:09] Bless your word now. Anoint us and help
[1:13:11] us, Lord, to be able to minister your
[1:13:13] word in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Turn
[1:13:17] your Bibles if you will to Matthew once
[1:13:19] again. We'll just kind of pick up where
[1:13:21] uh a couple of the scripture maybe
[1:13:23] couple of the scriptures that we used
[1:13:24] last week. Amen.
[1:13:28] Amen.
[1:13:31] Amen. But I want to speak on a more
[1:13:33] abundant life. A more abundant life.
[1:13:37] Life more abundantly. Amen. Uh Matthew 6
[1:13:41] and verse 24.
[1:13:47] Now, how many knows what how many knows
[1:13:49] uh how many masters there is in the
[1:13:51] world? There's only two masters. Amen.
[1:13:56] Only two.
[1:13:58] Amen. No man can serve two masters. For
[1:14:01] he will either hate the one and love the
[1:14:03] other, or else he will hold to the one
[1:14:05] and despise the other. You cannot serve
[1:14:08] God and mammon. In St. John 10 and 10.
[1:14:15] St. John 10 and 10.
[1:14:27] The thief cometh not, but for to steal
[1:14:31] and to kill and to destroy. I am come
[1:14:35] that you might have life, and that you
[1:14:36] might have it more abundantly.
[1:14:40] Amen.
[1:14:43] In uh Romans
[1:14:46] Romans 6,
[1:14:50] one more scripture and we'll let you
[1:14:51] have your seats.
[1:14:53] Amen.
[1:14:59] Romans 6 and verse 23 says, "For the
[1:15:03] wages of sin is death, but the gift of
[1:15:06] God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
[1:15:09] our Lord." God bless his word. You can
[1:15:11] be seated. Amen. This morning, praise
[1:15:14] the Lord.
[1:15:17] Now, that last scripture we read said
[1:15:20] that there's wages that come. How many
[1:15:22] knows that whether you serve God or
[1:15:25] whether you serve the devil, you get
[1:15:27] paid? Everybody gets paid whether you
[1:15:30] like it or not. Amen.
[1:15:33] God has put it in such a way in this
[1:15:35] world that you know there's uh two
[1:15:38] masters and you have to choose which one
[1:15:40] that you're going to serve. Amen. The
[1:15:43] decision is forced upon people. Amen. as
[1:15:46] I brought out a few weeks ago where we
[1:15:48] talked about how that God has given
[1:15:50] humanity a choice in that right and and
[1:15:53] I like what the prophet of God said one
[1:15:55] place he says you know God does not
[1:15:56] condemn the sinner for sinning for being
[1:16:00] a sinner you don't condemn him for that
[1:16:03] amen I thought you know and a certain
[1:16:05] scripture came to me about that how that
[1:16:08] you could actually justify that and how
[1:16:10] that would actually fit in Amen and in
[1:16:13] John 3
[1:16:15] John 3 it says, "For God so loved the
[1:16:18] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:16:21] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:16:23] not perish but have everlasting life.
[1:16:26] For God sent not his son into the world
[1:16:28] to condemn the world." Amen. You know,
[1:16:32] he knows we're condemned already. He
[1:16:34] knows the sinner's already a sinner and
[1:16:35] he's not condemning him for being a
[1:16:37] sinner.
[1:16:38] That's not the purpose. Amen. Amen. but
[1:16:42] that the world through him might be
[1:16:45] saved.
[1:16:47] As brother Bam said, he see, you know,
[1:16:49] he don't condemn him for being a sinner,
[1:16:52] but this is the condemnation. Listen to
[1:16:54] this. He says, "He that believeth on him
[1:16:57] is not condemned, but he that believeth
[1:16:59] not is condemned already because he has
[1:17:02] not believed on the name of the only
[1:17:04] begotten son of God." And this is the
[1:17:06] condemnation that light has come into
[1:17:08] the world and men love darkness rather
[1:17:11] than light. Amen. So that's the condemn.
[1:17:14] The real condemnation is people like
[1:17:16] darkness more than they like. They love
[1:17:18] light rather than accepting that if you
[1:17:21] accept God, you accept Christ, he came
[1:17:24] to give us life. That's the purpose of
[1:17:26] his coming. So he condemns the sinner
[1:17:29] for staying a sinner. Why? Because he
[1:17:32] makes another choice. You had no choice
[1:17:34] of being a sinner. You were born a sin,
[1:17:37] shaped iniquity, coming in the world
[1:17:38] speaking lies. But he gives the choice.
[1:17:43] Amen. Of whether you'll stay a sinner or
[1:17:45] not.
[1:17:47] Amen. And the condemnation is that some
[1:17:49] people just love darkness more than they
[1:17:52] like light. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:56] So God is good, isn't he?
[1:18:01] Brother Bren makes a statement several
[1:18:02] places. He says, "You know, we ought to
[1:18:04] be the happiest people on the face of
[1:18:06] the earth." And I've lived long enough
[1:18:08] now, Amen. to know that there's a lot in
[1:18:12] this world, Amen, to cause you not to be
[1:18:16] happy.
[1:18:19] Just the sheer responsibility of life.
[1:18:22] Ain't that right? Having to pay the
[1:18:23] bills and the grind of things and the
[1:18:25] aches and the pains and all the setbacks
[1:18:27] and everything that there is. Amen. It's
[1:18:30] a whole lot of reasons why not to be
[1:18:33] happy.
[1:18:35] Amen. If you aren't careful, you're
[1:18:37] going to be a grouchy old man, a grouchy
[1:18:39] old woman, a grouchy young person,
[1:18:42] a grouchy middle-aged person. Amen.
[1:18:45] Because why? There's plenty to be
[1:18:47] grouchy about, plenty to be sad about.
[1:18:51] But guess what? Jesus Christ came and
[1:18:53] showed himself alive in our day. Brother
[1:18:56] B says, after what he's done, we're
[1:18:58] serving a living Christ. We're not
[1:19:00] serving a Christ that stayed in a tomb,
[1:19:02] but we've got to resurrect the Jesus
[1:19:04] Christ that you and I serve. And he came
[1:19:07] to give us some things. The devil comes.
[1:19:10] He comes to give you some things. Isn't
[1:19:12] that right? He rewards you if you serve
[1:19:15] him. Sure. He gives you lots of rewards.
[1:19:18] Lots of freebies.
[1:19:20] Lots of free gifts he gives you.
[1:19:23] Oh my. He's such a terrible devil. I
[1:19:26] ain't going to say he's a good devil.
[1:19:28] He's not. But here are guaranteed that
[1:19:30] you'll get plenty of things. Amen.
[1:19:34] Amen. And you'll get plenty of rewards
[1:19:36] with Christ.
[1:19:38] The wages of sin. Amen. You serve that,
[1:19:40] it'll bring death. Now, we know that we
[1:19:43] as a human being, we're a triune being.
[1:19:45] Ain't that right? We're body, we're
[1:19:48] spirit, and we are soul. We have a body
[1:19:51] and spirit. Amen. That spirit you
[1:19:53] breathe in. Amen. Whenever you are born,
[1:19:55] if you don't take that breath of life,
[1:19:57] take that spirit in. Amen. You're still
[1:19:59] born, but you have a spirit. And then
[1:20:02] your soul, of course, is the real you on
[1:20:04] the inside of the inside. Amen. And the
[1:20:07] real you. Amen. We know that there's
[1:20:09] outside senses, the five senses of see,
[1:20:11] taste, feel, hear, and smell. And then
[1:20:13] there's the spirits. Amen. In that
[1:20:15] realm, it's conscience, imaginations,
[1:20:17] reasoning, memory, and so forth. And
[1:20:19] then on the inside of that is your soul.
[1:20:21] And it is only controlled by two things.
[1:20:24] One or the other. How many knows that?
[1:20:27] And that's either you're controlled by
[1:20:29] faith or you're controlled by doubt.
[1:20:32] Amen. Your life is run by faith or
[1:20:34] doubt. Man, I'll tell you what, you get
[1:20:36] in a situation where you might think
[1:20:38] there ain't no way nobody's ever going
[1:20:40] to come and save us out of this
[1:20:41] situation. Amen. One person will say,
[1:20:43] "Man, Dad, we ain't never going to get
[1:20:45] saved." The other person will say,
[1:20:47] "Yeah, I believe somebody's gonna find
[1:20:48] us." All right. Amen. You can smile with
[1:20:51] that, but listening to the other
[1:20:53] negative report, it's easy, amen, to be
[1:20:56] dis disheartened.
[1:20:58] That's the way it is with God. The devil
[1:21:00] tells you, "No, you're never going to be
[1:21:01] saved. You're going to die, and you're
[1:21:03] going to get put in the grave." But no,
[1:21:05] God says, "No, we're never going to die.
[1:21:06] He that liveth and believeth on me shall
[1:21:08] never die. Shall never see death." Why?
[1:21:11] Death means separation from God.
[1:21:15] Amen. That's what death is. Separation
[1:21:17] from God.
[1:21:20] Amen. So what we want to do with the
[1:21:22] help of the Lord for a little bit this
[1:21:24] morning, we want to look at the rewards
[1:21:26] of serving both masters. Is that okay?
[1:21:29] Let's just look at the rewards of
[1:21:31] serving these two masters. Only two. Now
[1:21:35] there's we of course we know there's
[1:21:36] many different gods. Ain't that right?
[1:21:39] Uh you know anything that anything that
[1:21:41] you put before God is your god or is an
[1:21:44] idol, something that you worship. But
[1:21:46] all of that realm, it doesn't matter
[1:21:48] what it is. It's all controlled by the
[1:21:49] devil. Amen. Let me just kind of put
[1:21:53] this in while I'm at it. Amen. A person
[1:21:55] that is serves the devil or the flesh.
[1:21:58] Hello. Amen. They they they live by see,
[1:22:00] taste, feel, hear, and smell. They live
[1:22:02] for that. But you don't. You live Amen.
[1:22:04] by the spirit that's on the inside of
[1:22:06] you. How many believe that? That's what
[1:22:08] we want to. God, take control of my
[1:22:10] spirit.
[1:22:12] Take control of my affection. Take
[1:22:14] control of my desires. Amen. My passion.
[1:22:17] take control of all of that. Amen.
[1:22:20] Now, I want to look at for a minute.
[1:22:22] Amen. First of all, let's look at uh uh
[1:22:25] Isaiah. Isaiah, we want to go to Isaiah
[1:22:29] 14. Amen. Isaiah 14.
[1:22:35] We read the part where uh uh last week
[1:22:39] where it says, "How art thou fallen from
[1:22:40] heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning?
[1:22:42] How art thou cut down to the ground
[1:22:44] which did weaken the nations? For thou
[1:22:47] has said in thine heart, amen, I will
[1:22:49] ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[1:22:51] throne above the stars of God. I will
[1:22:53] sit upon the mount of the congregation
[1:22:54] and the sides of the north. I will
[1:22:56] ascend above the height of the clouds. I
[1:22:58] will be like the most high. So, we took
[1:23:00] pride. You know, that's one of the
[1:23:01] things God hated was pride. Amen. Right?
[1:23:04] And the way up is down. He lifted
[1:23:06] himself up. Well, he's going to be
[1:23:07] brought down. Amen. I would be like the
[1:23:09] most high. Yet thou shalt be brought
[1:23:11] down the hill to the sides of the pit.
[1:23:14] And they that see thee shall narrowly
[1:23:15] look upon thee, and consider thee,
[1:23:17] saying, This is, is this the man that
[1:23:19] made the earth to tremble, and did shake
[1:23:22] shake the kingdoms, that made the world
[1:23:25] as a wilderness, and destroyed the
[1:23:28] cities thereof?
[1:23:30] Amen.
[1:23:34] Let me ask you something. Have y'all
[1:23:36] seen Gaza?
[1:23:38] Have y'all seen how it's just wiped out?
[1:23:40] How it just the city is in rubble?
[1:23:44] Right. Just in rubble. Who do you reckon
[1:23:46] did that?
[1:23:49] Amen.
[1:23:51] It was God's people that was defending
[1:23:54] themselves against people who slammed
[1:23:56] through the gates with big old dozers
[1:23:58] and come over and killed what 1,200
[1:24:00] Israelis, women, children, babies, just
[1:24:02] slaughtered them. One thing I want to
[1:24:05] remind all of these people that are for
[1:24:07] that, remember who broke through.
[1:24:08] Remember who started this war. It wasn't
[1:24:12] Israel that started the war. Amen. But
[1:24:15] what was it? It's an evil people that do
[1:24:18] something like that and end up just
[1:24:20] dating everything destroyed. Which
[1:24:23] brings it right back down here to Isaiah
[1:24:25] who destroyed the cities. How many know
[1:24:27] the devil is a destroyer?
[1:24:32] Oh my.
[1:24:35] That's right. He comes to kill, to
[1:24:37] steal, to destroy. Jesus comes to give
[1:24:41] us life
[1:24:43] more abundantly.
[1:24:46] How many is that there's something more?
[1:24:48] There's so much more to live for than uh
[1:24:55] clothes, food, shelter. Amen. And take
[1:24:58] taking care of ourselves. The Bible
[1:25:00] Jesus said, "Labor not for the meat that
[1:25:02] perishes, but labor for the meat that
[1:25:05] endures unto everlasting life."
[1:25:08] Don't worry about the body and so forth
[1:25:10] and what you shall eat and so forth. The
[1:25:11] heavenly father knows that you have need
[1:25:13] of the things.
[1:25:16] Amen.
[1:25:18] Praise the Lord. So a man's life does
[1:25:21] not consist of the abundance of things
[1:25:23] that he possesses. You know, I've been
[1:25:26] ran across I have ran across in the
[1:25:28] Bible so much is about about
[1:25:30] covetousness and how covetousness is
[1:25:33] evil. Amen. Amen. And I thought, Lord,
[1:25:35] help me to not be so covetous that we
[1:25:37] want this and want that and want the
[1:25:39] Don't be so covetous. Amen. Amen. Covet
[1:25:43] earnestly to Beth things. Isn't that
[1:25:44] right? That's the things of God. Now,
[1:25:48] let's get to our point here. He says,
[1:25:50] "Who made the world as a wilderness and
[1:25:53] destroyed the cities thereof that open
[1:25:56] not the house of his prisoners."
[1:26:01] Amen.
[1:26:02] Some know that the devil can't even
[1:26:05] release his prisoners.
[1:26:08] He can't set you free. He can't give you
[1:26:12] joy. He can't give you peace. He can't
[1:26:16] deliver you.
[1:26:18] He don't never open the house of his
[1:26:20] prisoners. How many know I'm so That's
[1:26:22] why we says once like a bird in prison I
[1:26:24] dwelt. No freedom from my sorrow I felt.
[1:26:27] But then Jesus came and listened to me
[1:26:29] and glory to God. He set me free. How
[1:26:32] many believe Jesus is the deliverer?
[1:26:36] How many glad that when he comes, what
[1:26:38] he brings is deliverance?
[1:26:45] Amen. I'm so thankful for that. Aren't
[1:26:48] you for that deliverance?
[1:26:53] Amen.
[1:26:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:59] No matter
[1:27:01] how deep we go in Christ,
[1:27:06] how mature we become in here, how much
[1:27:09] we understanding we have of his
[1:27:12] mysteries and of his plan, when we get
[1:27:15] over there,
[1:27:17] when we are in our cabin somewhere,
[1:27:19] hello. We're way down in the hollers of
[1:27:22] heaven somewhere.
[1:27:24] Amen. it all. We'll always be thankful
[1:27:26] for what God did for us. We'll always
[1:27:30] look at how he delivered us. How he
[1:27:34] snatched us from the power of the devil
[1:27:37] and translated us. How did he change us?
[1:27:42] We'll always think about amazing grace,
[1:27:45] how sweet the sound.
[1:27:48] Amen. Cuz if the devil had his way, I
[1:27:53] would have hair down to my shoulders.
[1:27:55] I'd have tattoos.
[1:27:58] I'd have a Budweiser in my hand. I'd be
[1:28:01] miserable as I'll get out. Hello. That's
[1:28:04] how the devil crowns his. But it's the
[1:28:07] amazing grace of God that I don't have
[1:28:10] to be a servant to the devil.
[1:28:14] Amen. Let me tell you something. A lot
[1:28:15] of people think that they want to live
[1:28:17] their own life, do their own thing,
[1:28:18] serve the devil, and and so forth, and
[1:28:20] then God take them on to heaven. That's
[1:28:22] not going to happen. Amen. In Philipp
[1:28:27] Colossians 1 and verse um
[1:28:32] we'll start with verse 13. who hath
[1:28:36] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:28:40] and translated us into the kingdom of
[1:28:44] his dear son. How many believe that God
[1:28:47] has brought deliverance to us?
[1:28:52] Delivered us from the power of the
[1:28:56] enemy.
[1:28:58] Caused us to escape the corruption that
[1:29:01] is in the world.
[1:29:04] Amen.
[1:29:06] I'm so thankful for that. Aren't you?
[1:29:11] Amen. Praise the Lord. God is good,
[1:29:13] isn't he?
[1:29:15] I am so glad that he delivered us.
[1:29:19] Amen.
[1:29:27] Amen.
[1:29:32] We should be the happiest people on the
[1:29:35] face of the earth. The happiest people.
[1:29:39] Amen. Because that's what he came to
[1:29:40] bring. I know it's a joy. God came to
[1:29:44] bring us joy unspeakable
[1:29:47] and full of glory.
[1:29:52] What are people like that serve the
[1:29:54] devil? What are they like?
[1:30:01] If you want to turn to Romans, you can.
[1:30:05] Romans 2 or Romans 1 and verse 21. We'll
[1:30:09] look at what people that serve the devil
[1:30:12] are like,
[1:30:15] what they're like.
[1:30:25] Romans 1. And you know,
[1:30:32] according to this, the what I'm fixing
[1:30:34] to read, it sounds like these people who
[1:30:36] really became wicked as all get out
[1:30:41] actually knew God at one time.
[1:30:46] 1 and verse 20. Read with me. For the
[1:30:49] invisible things of him from the
[1:30:51] creation of the world are clearly seen,
[1:30:53] being understood by the things that are
[1:30:55] made, even his eternal power and
[1:30:58] godhead, so that they are without excuse
[1:31:01] because that when they knew God,
[1:31:05] they glorified him not as God, and
[1:31:08] neither were they thankful.
[1:31:11] Doesn't the Bible say so much about in
[1:31:13] everything give thanks?
[1:31:17] In everything, be content. Be happy.
[1:31:20] Because the devil wasn't content in
[1:31:22] heaven. That's why God hates
[1:31:24] discontentment so much. He hates
[1:31:27] murmuring so much until I think 23,000
[1:31:30] in Israel were killed when they went to
[1:31:32] murmuring. I looked up that murmur a
[1:31:35] little bit. Amen. Over in e Exodus and
[1:31:38] almost one chapter after the other, they
[1:31:40] murmured again. They murmured and God
[1:31:42] destroyed a whole bunch of them for
[1:31:44] their complaining and for their and
[1:31:46] guess what then they murmured right away
[1:31:48] again and said you got these people
[1:31:50] killed murmured them bought that still
[1:31:53] had the audacity to murmur after tens of
[1:31:56] thousands were killed for murmuring
[1:31:59] my you have to wonder what kind of a
[1:32:01] airhead they were what what in the world
[1:32:04] no wonder hello I'm going to go ahead
[1:32:07] and say it no wonder God didn't let any
[1:32:09] of them go Remember,
[1:32:12] none of them went in. Only two out of
[1:32:13] two million. It was their children that
[1:32:15] they said would be destroyed that went
[1:32:17] in. I'll take your children in, but
[1:32:18] you're going to stay out here and die.
[1:32:20] When Jesus come along, he says they're
[1:32:22] everyone dead. Brother Bam said that
[1:32:24] means eternally separated. They didn't
[1:32:26] make it. Over in Hebrews, it says that
[1:32:28] they have not known my ways. That God
[1:32:32] loves to test you. He loves to try you.
[1:32:34] He likes to put you in to prove you.
[1:32:37] Isn't that what he did with Israel? He
[1:32:39] proved them to see whether they really
[1:32:41] had faith or not.
[1:32:47] Amen. God will prove each and every one
[1:32:50] of us. Amen. See whether we have faith
[1:32:52] or not. That's right. Amen. I hopefully
[1:32:56] hopefully we'll get to it, but if not,
[1:32:58] we'll get to it on Wednesday. But I want
[1:32:59] to talk to you about Amen. that rest
[1:33:01] that God gives us. The rest. Amen. That
[1:33:04] anchor that God gives us. all the good
[1:33:07] things that God gives us. So much so
[1:33:10] that you are not well here I go. You're
[1:33:13] not supposed to worry about anything.
[1:33:15] You shouldn't fear anything, not even
[1:33:17] death.
[1:33:18] Amen. Okay. Now, let's look at let's
[1:33:22] look at this. He says, "They glorified
[1:33:24] neither were thankful but became vain in
[1:33:27] their imagination and their foolish
[1:33:29] heart was darkened. Professing
[1:33:32] themselves to be wise, they became
[1:33:34] fools."
[1:33:36] Amen. And changed the glory of the
[1:33:38] incorruptible God into an image made
[1:33:40] like unto corruptible man and of birds
[1:33:42] and a for-footed beast and creeping
[1:33:44] things.
[1:33:47] My my
[1:33:51] you just take for what it's worth. But
[1:33:53] aren't they acting like cats and dogs
[1:33:55] now? Putting litter boxes into schools
[1:33:57] and whatnot all
[1:34:00] making to God like, you know, we're some
[1:34:02] kind of animals. It's just terrible,
[1:34:04] isn't it?
[1:34:06] They served and worshiped the creature
[1:34:09] more than the creator. Amen. Blessed be
[1:34:12] God forever. Now notice in verse 28.
[1:34:14] Even as they did not like to retain God
[1:34:17] in their knowledge, God gave them over
[1:34:20] to a reprobate mind.
[1:34:23] That's why I say it's a slim chance for
[1:34:25] somebody that's gone down that far.
[1:34:27] They've already been turned over to a
[1:34:28] rep probate mind. If God turns your
[1:34:30] mind,
[1:34:32] you beg for mercy. God help me. It turn
[1:34:35] it back. I don't know if you will or
[1:34:36] not. Hello. A rep probate mind to do
[1:34:40] though things which are not convenient.
[1:34:43] Being filled with all unrighteousness.
[1:34:46] Now, how much the Bible tells us that he
[1:34:48] that doeth righteous is righteous. He
[1:34:51] says be righteous. Amen. Even as God is
[1:34:53] righteous, we're supposed to be right.
[1:34:54] These are unrighteous people.
[1:34:57] Fornication. They're filled with it.
[1:34:59] They're filled with wickedness,
[1:35:02] covetousness.
[1:35:03] maliciousness,
[1:35:05] envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity,
[1:35:11] whisperers, backbiters, haters of God. I
[1:35:16] mean, know our streets are full of
[1:35:17] haters of God.
[1:35:20] Somebody just go out there and witness
[1:35:21] and try to say something, they'll spit
[1:35:23] on them and they come up at him and they
[1:35:24] want to kill them and oh, they would if
[1:35:26] they could. I mean, if they could get
[1:35:28] away with it, they'd kill those people
[1:35:30] that are testifying. They hate God.
[1:35:33] They're haters of God.
[1:35:37] Haters of God. Despiteful, proud,
[1:35:41] boasters, inventors of evil things,
[1:35:44] disobedient to parents. Amen. How many
[1:35:47] knows being disobedient to your parent
[1:35:50] is a terrible thing?
[1:35:53] without understanding,
[1:35:56] covenant breakers, without natural
[1:35:59] affection, implicable,
[1:36:02] unmerciful,
[1:36:04] who knowing the judgment of God, that
[1:36:07] they which commit such things are worthy
[1:36:09] of death. That's what Paul says.
[1:36:14] Not only do the same, but have pleasure
[1:36:16] in them that do them.
[1:36:20] So Paul says that's the those people
[1:36:22] that are like that are worthy of death.
[1:36:24] What is it's the wages of sin and
[1:36:26] serving the devil at death.
[1:36:30] 1 Corinthians 6 and9 says know ye not
[1:36:33] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[1:36:36] the kingdom of God.
[1:36:38] Oh God loves us too.
[1:36:41] Homosexuals,
[1:36:43] lesbians, fornicators, wicked people
[1:36:47] don't love God more than nothing. They
[1:36:49] say, "Well, God loves us, too." You
[1:36:51] know, he'll No. Paul says, "All of these
[1:36:54] type of people, you're not going to
[1:36:56] inherit the kingdom of heaven." What
[1:36:58] kind of heaven would it be?
[1:37:04] I'd be looking for another heaven,
[1:37:05] wouldn't you?
[1:37:09] That's right.
[1:37:11] Listen.
[1:37:12] Be not deceived, neither fornicators,
[1:37:16] nor idolattors, nor adulterers,
[1:37:19] nor ephe in e in epheminate.
[1:37:24] Huh? At least that's what I think it's
[1:37:27] talking about. Epheminite. Amen. nor
[1:37:30] abusers of themselves with mankind, nor
[1:37:33] thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,
[1:37:36] nor revelers, nor extortioners
[1:37:40] shall inherit the kingdom of God. Are
[1:37:43] you ready for something? And such were a
[1:37:47] lot of you or some of you.
[1:37:49] Aren't you glad that you're not that
[1:37:51] anymore? Thank you, Jesus. That's what
[1:37:54] we were. We were all of that when we
[1:37:57] served the power of darkness. But I know
[1:38:00] God has delivered us from that power.
[1:38:02] Why? Because you can't never quit no
[1:38:04] thing. You can't help your nature. You
[1:38:07] got to have a nature change. You got to
[1:38:09] have a spirit change. That's why the new
[1:38:12] birth is so important. You must be born
[1:38:15] again. Jesus said, "You've got to." Why?
[1:38:18] Because that's that nature that people
[1:38:20] are trapped in. Amen. And you want to
[1:38:22] try to change yourself. You can't never
[1:38:24] change yourself. It takes the power of
[1:38:26] the Holy Ghost to change you. It takes a
[1:38:29] fire to come into your soul and change
[1:38:32] it and burn those things out.
[1:38:36] That's why the Holy Ghost is so
[1:38:38] necessary.
[1:38:40] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:38:44] But such were some of you, but ye are
[1:38:49] washed.
[1:38:52] How many glad to be washed by the water
[1:38:54] of the word? Amen. that we might be
[1:38:57] spotless in the sight of Almighty God.
[1:39:00] He comes and washes us clean, washes our
[1:39:03] guilt away. God washes our shame away.
[1:39:07] Washes our past away. He justifies us.
[1:39:11] Well, here's Oh my. Listen to this. Now
[1:39:14] you are washed, but ye are sanctified,
[1:39:18] but ye are justified in the name of
[1:39:21] Jesus Christ by the spirit of our God.
[1:39:25] How many glad to be sanctified,
[1:39:27] justified, sanctified?
[1:39:30] Praise the Lord. God comes and cleans
[1:39:33] your past, cleans your history, changes
[1:39:36] your desires, changes your nature. We
[1:39:39] were all of that because we were serving
[1:39:41] the devil.
[1:39:44] But such were some of you. But now you
[1:39:48] are washed. Praise the Lord. Listen, how
[1:39:52] many know the devil, the devil, he comes
[1:39:55] and he gives to you free of charge?
[1:39:58] Fear.
[1:40:00] Ain't that right? That's the first thing
[1:40:02] Adam and Eve discovered after they
[1:40:04] sinned was fear. They want to hid
[1:40:07] themselves.
[1:40:09] Amen. People don't want to go to church
[1:40:11] because they're afraid the preacher is
[1:40:12] going to preach on them and it's going
[1:40:14] to make them kind of scared. Don't be
[1:40:16] scared. No. Come into the presence of
[1:40:19] God and let God talk to you. Jeff,
[1:40:21] afraid of the voice of God,
[1:40:24] afraid of hearing the truth. He gives
[1:40:26] you guilt.
[1:40:28] He gives you condemnation.
[1:40:31] That's what the devil brings. He brings
[1:40:33] you sickness and pain. I mean, know
[1:40:36] every sickness and every pain that there
[1:40:38] is out there. Every fear, every anxiety,
[1:40:42] every depression, every discomfort is
[1:40:44] out there. That's what the devil come.
[1:40:46] The devil come to bring discomfort, not
[1:40:48] comfort. Amen.
[1:40:53] Amen.
[1:40:55] Depression, oppression, and confusion.
[1:40:59] Aren't you glad that light scatters the
[1:41:01] darkness? Amen. In this evening time, it
[1:41:04] shall be light. I believe I'm looking at
[1:41:07] suns. Amen. Amen. The stars, morning
[1:41:10] stars, rise and shine for your light has
[1:41:13] come. Jesus has come and showed himself
[1:41:16] alive after 2,000 years. He has proven
[1:41:19] what church he was in, who he was with,
[1:41:21] whether it was the Baptist or the
[1:41:23] Methodist or Pentecostal. Amen. But he
[1:41:26] wasn't with them. He was with his
[1:41:27] prophet. Malachi 4 even had his picture
[1:41:30] taken with him. Hello.
[1:41:34] And told them all to repent, get right
[1:41:36] with God. He brings torment. Amen. He
[1:41:41] brings anxiety. How many knows anxiety
[1:41:43] is torment?
[1:41:45] He brings that. That's what offer. You
[1:41:47] get it with him. You get weary. He
[1:41:49] brings weariness.
[1:41:52] But Jesus says, "Come unto me all ye who
[1:41:54] are weary and heavily laden and I will
[1:41:57] give you rest."
[1:42:02] Aren't you glad that Jesus he brings and
[1:42:05] takes that weariness away
[1:42:07] and he gives you rest?
[1:42:11] The devil brings war, strife, debate,
[1:42:16] all those things we just read. That's
[1:42:18] what the devil brings. High blood
[1:42:20] pressure, diabetes, cancer, death, hate,
[1:42:24] murder, deception, lies. He brings all
[1:42:27] of those things.
[1:42:29] But oh my, I'm glad that that's not the
[1:42:34] world that you have to live in. You
[1:42:36] ain't got to live in that world. You
[1:42:37] ain't got to live in that realm. You
[1:42:39] ain't got to live in the world of
[1:42:41] sadness because Christ came to give us
[1:42:44] joy, peace, love.
[1:42:48] Amen. Longsuffering, gentleness,
[1:42:50] meekness, faith, the Holy Ghost, his
[1:42:54] very life he came to give us.
[1:43:03] Some people will crawl down the road.
[1:43:05] Some people will beat themselves on the
[1:43:07] back with lashes and so forth. Amen. And
[1:43:10] do penance and act like they're trying
[1:43:11] to get righteous. How many knows people
[1:43:13] do that around Easter and stuff?
[1:43:19] They'll do all kinds of things. Hurt
[1:43:21] themselves, bring pain. Oh my.
[1:43:25] I don't want to laugh, but that's funny.
[1:43:29] Why? Because it don't do a thing for
[1:43:31] you. He took the lashes for us. He paid
[1:43:34] the price for us. And when he gives it
[1:43:36] to us, he gives it free.
[1:43:39] It's totally paid for.
[1:43:43] Amen. And it ain't doing you one bit of
[1:43:45] good to do what you're doing. Catholics.
[1:43:47] Amen. And the road the beads to rub and
[1:43:49] this that and the other. It don't do one
[1:43:51] bit of good. God never told us to have
[1:43:53] that and to do that. He said have faith.
[1:43:57] We're justified by faith. Amen. And that
[1:44:00] not of yourself. It is the gift of God.
[1:44:03] How many glad for faith?
[1:44:05] One of the first things that God has to
[1:44:07] give you, amen, to escape the escape the
[1:44:10] corruption that is in the world, amen,
[1:44:11] and to get away from these attributes of
[1:44:14] the devil. Amen. Is to have faith.
[1:44:18] How do we overcome this devil? How do we
[1:44:20] overcome this depression, this anxiety,
[1:44:22] amen, this fear, this doubt, this guilt?
[1:44:26] Through faith.
[1:44:28] How many believe that? That's right.
[1:44:32] Oh my.
[1:44:35] First John 5 says it this way. For this
[1:44:38] is the love of God that we keep his
[1:44:40] commandments. And his commandments are
[1:44:42] not grievious. For whatsoever is born of
[1:44:45] God overcometh the world. And this is
[1:44:48] the victory that overcomes the world,
[1:44:51] even our faith. Who is he that
[1:44:54] overcometh the world? But he that
[1:44:56] believeth that Jesus is the son of God.
[1:44:59] How many knows? He's the only way out.
[1:45:01] There's no other way out. There's no
[1:45:04] other way. There's no other truth. There
[1:45:06] is no other life. Jesus said, "I am the
[1:45:09] way. I am the truth. And I am the life.
[1:45:11] And nobody's going to come to the Father
[1:45:13] but by me." His words are true.
[1:45:20] Amen.
[1:45:22] That's right. There's not a thousand
[1:45:24] different ways.
[1:45:25] The Pope doesn't have a problem with all
[1:45:27] the different religions coming. He says,
[1:45:29] "We're all the children of God."
[1:45:34] Yeah, you're right. You are just the
[1:45:37] wrong God.
[1:45:39] The God of lies, the God of murder.
[1:45:42] That's whose God you really are serving.
[1:45:46] Amen. My my my. But that's the truth.
[1:45:49] God doesn't just take anything in.
[1:45:58] Praise the Lord. I'm so glad for that.
[1:46:01] Aren't you? The victory that overcomes
[1:46:03] the world is our faith because it gives
[1:46:06] us access to God. How many That's the
[1:46:08] only way that you can come to God. The
[1:46:10] only way you can please God is through
[1:46:12] faith.
[1:46:14] Amen. You can't please God any other
[1:46:16] way. He that cometh to God must believe
[1:46:18] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[1:46:20] them that diligently seek him.
[1:46:25] Amen.
[1:46:26] I know sometimes people say, "Well, I'm
[1:46:28] trying and I'm trying to find God. I'm
[1:46:31] trying to get with God. I'm trying. I'm
[1:46:32] trying." You need to try. You need to
[1:46:34] try until you're so miserable you don't
[1:46:36] know what else to do but to surrender to
[1:46:38] him. Cuz somewhere there there's still
[1:46:41] something holding back.
[1:46:43] When you completely give yourself to
[1:46:45] God, say, "I'm yours, Lord. My mind is
[1:46:48] yours. My body is yours. My future's
[1:46:49] yours. Everything upon is yours, Lord. I
[1:46:52] die to myself." God is obligated to give
[1:46:55] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[1:46:56] there. He will give you the new birth
[1:46:59] right there when you're willing to die
[1:47:00] to yourself.
[1:47:02] Amen.
[1:47:05] He wants to see how serious you are.
[1:47:08] Amen. He may make it a little hard. You
[1:47:10] got to fight that battle. How many know
[1:47:11] that's the greatest battle is in the
[1:47:13] mind. Greatest battle ever fought is in
[1:47:15] the mind. Amen.
[1:47:19] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:23] Praise the Lord. So God comes to give us
[1:47:26] faith, gives us access to God. Access to
[1:47:32] God.
[1:47:37] Brother John, you sir, God bless you.
[1:47:39] Had a good trip.
[1:47:41] Good to see y'all. Isn't it something
[1:47:43] how here we sit?
[1:47:48] We think, well, we're just having
[1:47:50] another service. Brother Ber's
[1:47:51] preaching, another Sunday morning
[1:47:52] service, and you know, we'll go back
[1:47:55] home after a while and so forth. But do
[1:47:58] you realize this morning that for those
[1:48:01] of us who have the Holy Spirit
[1:48:04] that God is here? How many believe God
[1:48:07] is here?
[1:48:09] God is here in his people. He's here in
[1:48:13] my heart. He's there in your heart. God
[1:48:16] almighty is here. And all things are
[1:48:18] possible where God is.
[1:48:21] Hallelujah. Because why? He's given us
[1:48:23] faith to escape the corruption that is
[1:48:25] in the world to come. And he come to
[1:48:28] give us
[1:48:30] assurance.
[1:48:31] We're in a world, man, that we don't
[1:48:33] know what's going to happen next, do we?
[1:48:36] We don't know what's going to happen.
[1:48:39] You know, there's those analysts and
[1:48:41] stuff that, you know, if if
[1:48:44] it's so crazy, it's a crazy world.
[1:48:49] You read one news and it says, you know,
[1:48:51] half of the Arab nations, you know,
[1:48:52] they're not siding with Iran. And then
[1:48:55] another news says, hey, all the Arabs
[1:48:57] are mad. You know, they're they're going
[1:48:58] to stick up for Iran. They can't do
[1:48:59] that. You don't you got to watch what
[1:49:01] you believe, right?
[1:49:03] our Congress, half of them is against
[1:49:05] what Trump did and the other half is for
[1:49:07] what he did and hello
[1:49:11] Putin don't like what he did what we
[1:49:13] did. Don't you do that Trump
[1:49:18] different are saying look all this could
[1:49:20] happen and it could be the edge of World
[1:49:22] War II. Yeah, it could be. It could be
[1:49:25] the world edge of World War II,
[1:49:32] folks. How many knows it could get a lot
[1:49:34] more stressful? Probably will yet before
[1:49:35] we go,
[1:49:37] a lot more stressful for the world, a
[1:49:40] lot more closer to the edge. And isn't
[1:49:43] it something how Putin different times
[1:49:45] threatens to annihilate, threatens to,
[1:49:47] you know, you know, most of the time
[1:49:48] when people's fixing the fight, they
[1:49:50] talk about it first. They threaten it
[1:49:52] many times, but then eventually they do.
[1:49:55] It comes to it. And when they're talking
[1:49:57] about the sero when they're talking
[1:49:59] about fixing a nuke, you know, it's
[1:50:02] they're getting primed. One of these
[1:50:04] days they'll do it.
[1:50:06] But I can say this morning it if I knew
[1:50:08] they were going to blow us up tomorrow,
[1:50:10] brother Brad, those nukes are going to
[1:50:12] be flying through the air tomorrow.
[1:50:15] I'd say, "Well, so what?
[1:50:19] So what?"
[1:50:23] Why? Because there's a hiding place.
[1:50:27] That hiding place, that place of safety
[1:50:30] is not in the US. It's not in the dome.
[1:50:32] It's in Christ.
[1:50:34] How many believe we're safe from harm?
[1:50:38] Leaning on Jesus. Leaning on Jesus. Safe
[1:50:41] and secure from all alarm. You ain't got
[1:50:44] to worry about it because Jesus come to
[1:50:47] take away worry. But the B says the
[1:50:49] worry has no virtue at all. God doesn't
[1:50:52] want you to fear not. Jesus said, "Fear
[1:50:55] not. Never fear." The believer doesn't
[1:50:58] have any fear. Why? Because if you've
[1:51:00] got the love of God in your heart the
[1:51:02] way you're supposed to have it, you
[1:51:05] ain't got to fear one thing. I read a
[1:51:06] quote where better bam says, you know,
[1:51:08] even to the saintest of Christians, when
[1:51:11] death strikes him, sometimes we can buck
[1:51:13] at it. It can affect us. He says, but we
[1:51:16] don't have to fear. We don't have to
[1:51:18] fear. Why? Because we don't even have to
[1:51:20] fear death. Ain't that right?
[1:51:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:27] Hallelujah.
[1:51:33] Because why? Because we can't lose. How
[1:51:35] many knows when you become a Christian,
[1:51:38] you stop being a loser.
[1:51:42] That right. That's right. You stop being
[1:51:43] a loser and you start being a winner.
[1:51:48] You're a winner
[1:51:50] and you can't lose. a real born again
[1:51:53] Christian, there's no such a thing as
[1:51:55] losing.
[1:51:57] Let let me read you lead you to that a
[1:52:00] quote for a minute. There's many of
[1:52:02] those who have done crossed the great
[1:52:05] sea, the divide. I've watched them at
[1:52:07] the end of the road bury them. Just as
[1:52:10] sure as there's a God in heaven, I
[1:52:11] believe that if I'll live true to him
[1:52:13] someday in a better land, I'll be with
[1:52:16] him again. So that's the main thing.
[1:52:20] After all, what is life?
[1:52:23] We just don't know how long it's going
[1:52:24] to last.
[1:52:26] Just might be gone this afternoon. This
[1:52:29] may be our last time together. Did you
[1:52:31] know that? But whether it is or not,
[1:52:36] we can't lose.
[1:52:40] There's no way for Christianity to lose.
[1:52:44] You can't lose no matter what you do.
[1:52:46] There's no loss in Christianity.
[1:52:50] All that come to me. Amen. I will lose
[1:52:55] nothing.
[1:52:57] He don't lose. Jesus isn't going to lose
[1:52:59] you. If you're in his hands, there's no
[1:53:02] such a thing as losing. It don't matter.
[1:53:04] Even po uh Paul said, you know, we're
[1:53:07] cast down but not forsaken, persecuted,
[1:53:09] and so forth. All these things, all the
[1:53:11] trials, all the hardships, all of these
[1:53:13] things that come on a believer, but yet
[1:53:15] we don't lose.
[1:53:20] Amen.
[1:53:22] Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad for
[1:53:24] that?
[1:53:27] Even Jesus said, "He that liveth and
[1:53:28] believeth me shall never die." Amen.
[1:53:33] So he says, "But the B says, we can't
[1:53:35] die. We can't cease to exist. We'll
[1:53:38] always be." There was a time when you
[1:53:40] wasn't nothing or anything, but there
[1:53:42] will never be a time. But what? You'll
[1:53:43] be something somewhere.
[1:53:46] You're going to be somewhere from this,
[1:53:48] amen, through all the ceaseless ages of
[1:53:51] eternity. So now I just think about the
[1:53:54] sometimes when trials get hard and I hit
[1:53:57] snags like in life like everybody. Some
[1:54:00] hard trials have to pull hard to get
[1:54:02] through. But when I'm up against it, I
[1:54:05] just think of this. Well, what
[1:54:07] difference does it make?
[1:54:10] Amen. Praise the Lord. The Bible said,
[1:54:14] "All things work together for good to
[1:54:16] them that love God." Is that right? So
[1:54:19] maybe it's for my good, so I just go
[1:54:21] right on ahead and take it anyway.
[1:54:23] There's nothing can bother you. Even
[1:54:24] death can't bother you. Amen. Like the
[1:54:27] Apostle Paul said when they were
[1:54:29] building the scaffold out there, he
[1:54:31] said, "Oh death, where is your sting? Oh
[1:54:34] grave, where is your victory?"
[1:54:40] Amen.
[1:54:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:45] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad that we can
[1:54:46] have that kind of confidence,
[1:54:49] that kind of an anchor?
[1:54:51] Amen. Like the woman that was coming
[1:54:54] across the ocean in a boat, big old
[1:54:57] ship, and that ship was about to go
[1:54:59] down. The captain says, "You know, in
[1:55:01] the next five minutes, we're either
[1:55:03] going to get through this storm or we're
[1:55:04] going to go down."
[1:55:07] She got happy and got to praising the
[1:55:09] Lord. And I believe they said, "Lady,
[1:55:11] you need to get to praying." If I
[1:55:13] remember the story, right? You better
[1:55:14] get to praying. She says, "I don't need
[1:55:16] to pray.
[1:55:18] I'm already prayed up."
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:21] I mean, please. That's right. That's the
[1:55:23] way it is. Oh, there might be a World
[1:55:25] War II tomorrow. Oh, we better pray.
[1:55:27] What are you talking about? You better
[1:55:28] be prayed up already.
[1:55:31] You better be ready anytime. You better
[1:55:33] be ready to go, church.
[1:55:36] How many believe that? We want to be I
[1:55:37] want you ready. I don't want you to have
[1:55:40] to get ready. I want you ready because
[1:55:41] we don't know what hour, what time he's
[1:55:43] going to come.
[1:55:45] I'm telling you, and it's past time
[1:55:47] almost way late. How many knows it?
[1:55:52] Amen.
[1:55:55] Amen. Sometimes we think, well, I'm
[1:55:56] ready to go. I'm ready to go.
[1:56:01] Amen. Sister Janette, Sherry, Donna,
[1:56:06] when the doctor says there's nothing can
[1:56:08] be done for you, then you'll find out
[1:56:10] whether you're ready to go or not. It's
[1:56:12] easy to say that with your mouth.
[1:56:15] Amen.
[1:56:17] I don't say that you can't know it
[1:56:19] without that kind of situation, but that
[1:56:21] certainly will search your heart to see
[1:56:23] where you're at or not. I could give you
[1:56:26] a little testimony of something, but I
[1:56:27] won't at this time. But I'm here to tell
[1:56:29] you, I do know that what you want to do
[1:56:31] is have a goal that whether I live or
[1:56:34] whether I die, but Abraham says, "Sink
[1:56:36] or swim, what difference does it make?"
[1:56:39] Amen. That lady, back to the story, the
[1:56:41] lady says, "Pray." I already prayed. He
[1:56:43] says, "I'm a winner either way." Ain't
[1:56:46] that right? And she had a daughter that
[1:56:48] had passed away and went to glory. And
[1:56:50] there was another one in New York that
[1:56:52] she was going to visit. He says, "I'll
[1:56:54] tell you what. If we go down, I go see
[1:56:56] the one. And if I don't go down, I got
[1:56:58] to say the other one.
[1:57:01] That's right. How many believe that's
[1:57:02] where we want to be? Be ready. She was
[1:57:05] anchored.
[1:57:07] You talk about a shifting world and
[1:57:10] dissatisfied world and a chaotic world
[1:57:13] and a and all of these things, riots and
[1:57:17] everything else that's going on.
[1:57:25] I want to say that
[1:57:27] we as Christians,
[1:57:30] we don't even hear that.
[1:57:33] We don't even hear that. Why? Because
[1:57:36] we've come into the holies of holies.
[1:57:38] But Abraham says that curtain is
[1:57:40] soundproof.
[1:57:42] Every time we hear of something that
[1:57:44] seems to be like scary or oh this is
[1:57:46] scary, it don't scare the believer.
[1:57:49] How many knows we we're past that scare?
[1:57:52] You don't have to be scared. You don't
[1:57:54] have to be afraid.
[1:57:57] You just pity those people. There was a
[1:58:00] time when you was in rioting.
[1:58:03] You was in all of these chaos. You was
[1:58:05] in the devil's chaos.
[1:58:08] But now you've been washed.
[1:58:10] Now you're not. You're somewhere in a
[1:58:12] that has some a hold of something. Young
[1:58:14] people, you better get a hold of
[1:58:15] something that is anchors you no matter
[1:58:18] what happens
[1:58:22] because when you're younger, you could
[1:58:24] get scared a lot easier. Things may
[1:58:26] scare you a lot easier. That's why you
[1:58:28] have to get on your prayer bones more
[1:58:30] and say, "God, let me be so anchored in
[1:58:32] you that no matter what happens,
[1:58:36] Amen.
[1:58:38] It won't shake me.
[1:58:40] It won't move me." Remember, I think it
[1:58:42] said the other day when brother Bam
[1:58:44] says, you know, that uh that when the
[1:58:46] seals were open and everything, he says,
[1:58:47] "Now, what are we going to do? You know,
[1:58:48] should I sell my farm and all this,
[1:58:49] that, or the other?" No, just keep doing
[1:58:51] what you're doing. Plant your potatoes.
[1:58:53] Keep going right on. Don't change a
[1:58:55] thing. You shouldn't have to change a
[1:58:58] thing.
[1:58:59] Amen. You should be right where you are.
[1:59:04] Amen.
[1:59:06] Because why? Let me hurry just a little
[1:59:09] bit.
[1:59:11] Praise the Lord. How many believes that
[1:59:13] God gives us rest?
[1:59:17] We who are weary, come unto me all you
[1:59:20] who are weary and heavy laden. I will
[1:59:23] give you rest.
[1:59:26] Amen. Here it says, "And the peace of
[1:59:28] God which passes all understanding shall
[1:59:31] keep your hearts and minds through Jesus
[1:59:33] Christ." Brethren, whatsoever things are
[1:59:36] true, whatsoever things are honest,
[1:59:37] whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[1:59:40] things are pure, whatsoever things are
[1:59:41] lovely, whatsoever things are good, of
[1:59:43] good report, if there be any virtue,
[1:59:45] there be any praise, think on.
[1:59:49] Two quotes, two scriptures later, Paul
[1:59:51] says, "Not that I speak in respect of
[1:59:53] want, for I have learned that in
[1:59:54] whatever state I am therewith to be
[1:59:57] content." Paul was happy even if they
[1:59:59] were trying to top his head off. He was
[2:00:02] happy because of where he was. No matter
[2:00:04] how hard a trials, how much things that
[2:00:07] we go through, how many storms there
[2:00:09] are, the believer is anchored in Christ,
[2:00:13] it doesn't move him. Amen. How many
[2:00:17] believes that we need to be anchor?
[2:00:18] We're so thankful for that anchor. How
[2:00:20] many glad for an anchor in this world?
[2:00:22] If there ever was a time for you to be
[2:00:24] anchored, it's now. And that anchor,
[2:00:27] that rock is Jesus.
[2:00:30] This rock is Jesus. Yes, he's the one.
[2:00:34] Amen. And come to church here every day
[2:00:36] of your life.
[2:00:38] You know, be a member here, pay your
[2:00:40] tithe, and be a good person, but you
[2:00:41] better have something deeper than that.
[2:00:43] You better have that relationship with
[2:00:45] Jesus Christ on a daily basis. Amen.
[2:00:51] You know, we think we need to pray more,
[2:00:52] pray more, take more time to pray. I was
[2:00:54] yesterday just doing different things
[2:00:56] and talking to the Lord and thinking and
[2:00:58] that thought came to me. You know, Paul
[2:01:00] said, "Praying always, always praying,
[2:01:03] lifting up holy hands." You should
[2:01:04] constantly be talking to the Lord,
[2:01:07] always conversing with the Lord Jesus.
[2:01:08] Keep your mind that way all the time.
[2:01:10] That's the only way you can pray all
[2:01:12] constantly and always be in prayer. Not
[2:01:15] that you don't take your time because
[2:01:16] I'll tell you what, I'll tell you, I'll
[2:01:18] just be honest with you. When I'm back
[2:01:20] there and certain times during the day
[2:01:22] and mornings, there's just something
[2:01:24] special to me about getting down on your
[2:01:26] knee. Getting on that chair and say,
[2:01:28] "God, I bow my knee to you."
[2:01:32] Hello. A special respect. Just bow on
[2:01:35] the knees. Say, "God, you know what I
[2:01:37] have need of?" Amen. I don't know. To
[2:01:40] me, it just feels good. It feels good.
[2:01:43] You can stand and pray, lifting up holy
[2:01:45] hands, or you can kneel and pray. But
[2:01:47] whatever you do is just have that
[2:01:49] constant prayer. So that would be my
[2:01:50] advice this morning to everybody here.
[2:01:52] Remember to stay in constant prayer with
[2:01:54] the Lord. Constant say, "Lord Jesus,
[2:01:57] when you're down the road, how how are
[2:01:58] you doing, Lord? Just speak to my
[2:02:00] heart." Amen. It's time to be ready.
[2:02:02] Amen. For what comes ahead, for what
[2:02:05] lays ahead because it is certainly very,
[2:02:07] very late hour. The storms are raging.
[2:02:15] Amen.
[2:02:19] I love this quote that brother Madam
[2:02:21] made. He says, he says, "I find around
[2:02:25] most Christian lives," he says, I hate
[2:02:27] to say it that way, but it's true. Most
[2:02:30] people that can profess Christianity,
[2:02:32] they just seem such have a hard time
[2:02:34] struggling, hard time trying to hold on.
[2:02:38] Yeah. I believe it's because of a lack
[2:02:39] of correct teaching in the Bible.
[2:02:40] There's no such a thing as holding on.
[2:02:42] He done the holding on. The whole whole
[2:02:46] principle
[2:02:49] the whole Christian principle is based
[2:02:51] upon rest.
[2:02:54] Amen. Didn't Didn't Paul said that, you
[2:02:56] know, they were keeping the Sabbath and
[2:02:58] so forth? He says, "But we have entered
[2:03:00] into rest." How many believe we have
[2:03:02] entered into that place of rest?
[2:03:06] What is that? That is Christ. Sure, we
[2:03:08] fight battles. How many know we fight
[2:03:10] battles every day? We're in a constant
[2:03:12] battle all the time. But we can say that
[2:03:14] we're resting. Why? We're happy. Those
[2:03:17] battles don't worry us. Don't make us
[2:03:19] frustrated and all of that and worry.
[2:03:21] No. Because we know he's got the battle.
[2:03:24] He's got this.
[2:03:27] You can rest in Christ. Amen. It's Amen.
[2:03:30] Because even Jesus said, "Come unto me
[2:03:32] all you who are weary and heavily laden.
[2:03:34] I will give you rest." You don't have to
[2:03:36] worry and struggle. You're just resting.
[2:03:38] That's all. given rest and you enter
[2:03:41] into peace. Amen.
[2:03:44] Oh my. How many knows that man when your
[2:03:47] mind is bothering you,
[2:03:50] when you have condemnation, you have no
[2:03:52] peace.
[2:03:54] You know you're not right with God, you
[2:03:56] don't have no peace.
[2:03:58] Any of us that's been Christians, if you
[2:04:01] grieve the Holy Ghost away, you know how
[2:04:03] miserable you are.
[2:04:06] Amen. You know it's miserable.
[2:04:09] When you ain't got that Holy Spirit in
[2:04:11] your heart, no peace. There's no peace
[2:04:14] for the wicked, sayeth the Lord.
[2:04:17] But when you've got it under the blood.
[2:04:21] Oh, the devil. He's Man, I'm here to
[2:04:23] tell you, he's got a the best bait
[2:04:27] caster. He's got the best fishing pole
[2:04:29] in the world. He loves to go fishing.
[2:04:33] The devil loves to go fishing. Amen. He
[2:04:36] will tell you now you know back in your
[2:04:38] past you know uh you know something that
[2:04:41] you did wrong and you can't even go back
[2:04:43] and make that right because they're gone
[2:04:44] or this that or the other and you know
[2:04:46] that's not right.
[2:04:49] Hello. How many know he loves to go?
[2:04:55] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:58] Hopefully you young people don't never
[2:04:59] know. Make no mistakes try to do
[2:05:01] everything right all the time. But if
[2:05:03] you do remember this. Get it under the
[2:05:05] blood. Say, "God, forgive me for that."
[2:05:08] Amen. And when the devil tries to do
[2:05:10] that to me, you know what I do? And the
[2:05:12] revelation I got is, "Do you really
[2:05:14] believe, Thomas, that the blood of Jesus
[2:05:17] Christ is powerful enough to erase
[2:05:19] that?" And I say, "Yeah, I do. I believe
[2:05:21] he's powerful enough to erase it."
[2:05:27] Say, "There, devil,
[2:05:30] let me rip your line. Get out of this
[2:05:32] pond." All right. You ain't going to
[2:05:34] pull that up.
[2:05:36] That's right. Just get on out of here.
[2:05:38] It sure it is. We know that every one of
[2:05:41] us, if there's something that you did
[2:05:42] wrong that you can make right, you're
[2:05:44] going to make it right. Isn't that
[2:05:46] right? If you can't, you make it right.
[2:05:50] Confessions from heaven. A revelation
[2:05:52] God gave me a long time ago. The Holy
[2:05:54] Spirit is sensitive. Why do you think he
[2:05:56] convicts you of the wrong? Can you
[2:05:58] imagine hope coming back from heaven and
[2:06:01] she had something to confess to Brother
[2:06:03] Brandham?
[2:06:05] Ain't that y'all remember that? And she
[2:06:07] come back to heaven and talking about
[2:06:09] when he went and got her those socks.
[2:06:11] Ain't that right? And he got her a
[2:06:14] rayon. He got them the wrong kind. And
[2:06:15] she never told him that you had gotten
[2:06:17] the wrong kind. And she made that right
[2:06:19] and says, "I never told you that, but I
[2:06:21] just wanted to tell you that."
[2:06:24] Come on, people. We do want things
[2:06:27] right.
[2:06:28] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:32] Hallelujah.
[2:06:34] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:38] Can I have 10 more minutes?
[2:06:41] All right.
[2:06:42] How many knows that God does a work in
[2:06:44] us?
[2:06:46] He does a work in us. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:50] And uh I think it's in Romans here,
[2:06:54] the Ron the 8th chapter, one of my
[2:06:56] favorite scriptures.
[2:06:58] I like this. There is therefore now no
[2:07:00] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[2:07:02] Jesus who walked not after the flesh but
[2:07:04] after the spirit. Amen.
[2:07:13] See for whom he did forno he also did
[2:07:17] predestinate to be conformed to the
[2:07:18] image of his son that he might be the
[2:07:20] firstborn amongy brethren. Remember he
[2:07:23] says now you are justified. Now you are
[2:07:26] sanctified.
[2:07:30] Moreover, whom he did predestinate. Them
[2:07:32] he also called.
[2:07:34] Them whom he called, he also justified.
[2:07:36] And whom he justified, them he has also
[2:07:39] glorified.
[2:07:40] How many believes that in God's mind,
[2:07:42] you are already glorified. He's already
[2:07:44] got a body for you over there. It's
[2:07:47] already waiting.
[2:07:49] That's why you long for perfection. You
[2:07:51] come to church, say, "God, perfect me.
[2:07:53] Lord, show me my bad places because
[2:07:55] we're going to that body that's perfect.
[2:07:58] Amen.
[2:08:01] Listen to this. What shall we say to
[2:08:03] these things then? If God be for us, who
[2:08:06] can be against us? How can you lose? No.
[2:08:11] He spared not his own son, but delivered
[2:08:13] up for us all. How shall he not with him
[2:08:15] also freely give us all things? Didn't
[2:08:20] Paul says whether there's things
[2:08:21] present, whether it's life or whether
[2:08:23] it's death or the world to come,
[2:08:25] principal, all things are your
[2:08:27] everything is yours.
[2:08:30] That's the kind of gift God gives.
[2:08:32] That's what comes with the reward. Amen.
[2:08:34] That comes with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:08:37] Everything. The meek shall inherit the
[2:08:39] earth.
[2:08:41] Don't worry about your little this,
[2:08:43] that, or the other. Amen. driving to
[2:08:46] church. There's a brand new mansion of a
[2:08:49] house somebody built. Glad for glad they
[2:08:51] can. That's very nice. But I said,
[2:08:53] "Lord, I'm looking for my other kind of
[2:08:56] mansion. I'm looking for that other kind
[2:08:59] of mansion. That one will have to be
[2:09:00] maintained and maintenance and in time
[2:09:02] would crumble and fall like all the
[2:09:04] rest. But the body that you and I get,
[2:09:07] that mansion we get, it's going to be
[2:09:09] eternal."
[2:09:11] I want to tell you this morning, I
[2:09:12] believe it's time for us to get our turn
[2:09:14] your eyes upon Jesus. Look full in his
[2:09:16] wonderful face and start looking for a
[2:09:19] meeting in the air. I'm looking for
[2:09:22] heaven right ahead of us. I'm looking
[2:09:23] for a rapture right ahead of us. All the
[2:09:26] world's conditions, they're ready for
[2:09:27] tribulation. I'm getting ready for a
[2:09:30] rapture.
[2:09:32] Amen.
[2:09:36] What devil shall lay anything at the
[2:09:39] charge of God's elect? Who shall lay
[2:09:41] anything at the charge of God's elect?
[2:09:43] It is God that justifies. Amen. Who is
[2:09:46] he that condemnth? It's Christ that
[2:09:48] died. Yay. Rather that is risen again,
[2:09:50] who is even at the right hand of God,
[2:09:53] whom also maketh intercession for us.
[2:09:55] What shall separate us from the love of
[2:09:57] God?
[2:09:58] tribulation, distress, persecution,
[2:10:02] famine, nakedness, peril, or sort. Nah,
[2:10:06] it is written, "For thy sake we are
[2:10:08] killed all the day long, but we are
[2:10:10] still unmovable."
[2:10:13] Amen. How many believes that the
[2:10:14] Christian is unmovable?
[2:10:16] Praise the Lord. I didn't get to read
[2:10:17] this other scripture. I wanted to read
[2:10:20] in Thessalonians,
[2:10:22] 2 Thessalonians. It says, "Now we
[2:10:25] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[2:10:26] our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our
[2:10:28] gathering together unto him, that ye be
[2:10:31] not soon shaken in mind
[2:10:34] or be troubled." How many would say,
[2:10:37] "Lord, help me. Let me live that kind of
[2:10:38] life that no matter what comes, it don't
[2:10:41] shake me. It doesn't trouble me." Why?
[2:10:44] Because I'm completely in the hands of
[2:10:47] God. I'm completely resting in Christ no
[2:10:51] matter what comes. No other, no matter
[2:10:54] what my future is, God has me. Amen.
[2:10:57] Listen to what he says. Or to be
[2:10:59] troubled, neither by spirit nor by word
[2:11:04] nor by letter as from us.
[2:11:08] I don't know about you, if Paul write me
[2:11:10] a letter that was a little disturbing, I
[2:11:12] might get a little disturbed.
[2:11:15] But am I reading this right? Even if
[2:11:17] it's a letter from us, don't get shaken.
[2:11:20] Amen. Don't be disturbed in your spirit
[2:11:22] or your mind.
[2:11:24] Amen. Letter as from us as that day of
[2:11:27] the Lord of Christ is at hand. Reason I
[2:11:32] read that about justified, sanctified,
[2:11:35] amen, and glorified is I wanted to take
[2:11:38] one type here before we close. Brother
[2:11:41] Brandon been preaching the future home
[2:11:43] and he talks about how that the earth
[2:11:45] here is one of God's attributes. It was
[2:11:48] in his mind that he wanted to have a
[2:11:50] planet. He wanted to have earth. I mean,
[2:11:53] heavens and earth shall pass away. How
[2:11:55] many knows that it'll pass away? And
[2:11:58] whenever he drowned the earth in the
[2:12:01] analovian destruction,
[2:12:04] ain't that right?
[2:12:09] It was the baptism. It's the water
[2:12:11] baptism. The world got its water baptism
[2:12:14] under Noah. It was its justification.
[2:12:19] And under Christ, when Christ came and
[2:12:22] dropped his blood on it, hello. How many
[2:12:26] knows it was sanctified? That's right.
[2:12:29] He purchased it. He bought it. How many
[2:12:31] knows he done bought it?
[2:12:34] He owns it. It belongs to him.
[2:12:39] [Laughter]
[2:12:41] Aren't you glad that you belong to God?
[2:12:44] He done bought you. He done paid for
[2:12:46] you.
[2:12:48] I'm glad he done paid for me.
[2:12:52] The only He's the devil now is just a
[2:12:54] squatter.
[2:12:56] Only he who now letth will let until he
[2:12:59] comes to redeem his purchased
[2:13:02] possession. How many believe? Ephesians
[2:13:04] 1. Christ is coming to redeem what he
[2:13:07] has purchased. That's why you better be
[2:13:09] bought. You better be under the blood of
[2:13:11] Jesus Christ because when he comes
[2:13:12] that's the only thing he's coming for is
[2:13:15] people that has been under the blood
[2:13:16] that has accepted it. Amen.
[2:13:20] Praise the Lord.
[2:13:22] Hallelujah.
[2:13:24] And so the reason I said that the earth
[2:13:26] is actually part of uh his attributes
[2:13:31] and it's not going to be annihilated is
[2:13:33] it? No. and you were one of his
[2:13:36] attributes. Even though where you were
[2:13:38] born in sin shapen in iniquity, but God
[2:13:41] had to come and do a work in you. That's
[2:13:43] right. He had to justify you. You had to
[2:13:45] get baptized in the water. You had to be
[2:13:48] sanctified. And you had to be filled
[2:13:49] with the Holy Ghost. You needed a fire
[2:13:51] to come down. Amen. Brother type brother
[2:13:54] Bam types this. Listen to what he says.
[2:13:58] He says, "Now in the end destruction,
[2:14:00] repentance then was brought by water.
[2:14:02] Then Christ came and shed his blood upon
[2:14:03] it to cleanse it. And listen, and then
[2:14:06] he comes next. He's the destruction of
[2:14:09] the world as it is now. All the sins
[2:14:12] that's in the heavens above, the prince
[2:14:14] of power of the air. How many knows that
[2:14:16] Satan is still the prince and power of
[2:14:17] the air? He says he wards off the
[2:14:20] blessings of God. And there comes
[2:14:22] thunderbolts of lightnings and strikes
[2:14:24] the earth and everything from the
[2:14:26] heavens, sheets and ice of rain and
[2:14:27] typhoons and storms. Everything comes
[2:14:30] from above which is is Satan, the prince
[2:14:31] and power of the earth. Say Satan will
[2:14:34] be taken from the earth just exactly
[2:14:38] like Satan was taken from you.
[2:14:42] I mean believe Satan has been taken from
[2:14:44] you. Those devils has been taken from
[2:14:46] you.
[2:14:47] Amen. They ain't got no right anymore.
[2:14:49] You've been delivered from the power of
[2:14:51] the enemy. Amen. Oh, he can tempt but he
[2:14:54] can get not again. He can't get a born
[2:14:56] again Christian for God from the
[2:14:58] foundation of the world forsaw him.
[2:15:00] Amen. Now notice by the same means he
[2:15:04] says for the world is one of his
[2:15:06] attributes just the same as you are one
[2:15:08] of his attributes. Amen. Now know he
[2:15:11] says because it was in his thinking in
[2:15:12] the beginning. Amen. Before he when he
[2:15:16] was thinking that he would have a world
[2:15:19] there would be a throne. There would be
[2:15:20] a king to be a redeemer. He was a
[2:15:23] healer. That was his attributes. He
[2:15:25] says, "Notice now." He says, "You Bible
[2:15:28] students, especially Dr. Levale and so
[2:15:30] forth looking at me." Second Peter the
[2:15:33] third chapter says that the word in the
[2:15:35] Greek means cosmos, which means the
[2:15:38] world order. Amen. Talking about the
[2:15:41] world shall pass away. Amen. With a
[2:15:43] great noise. The earth shall pass away.
[2:15:46] Melt with elements with fervent heat.
[2:15:48] See, doesn't mean that the earth, the
[2:15:50] planet's going to pass or be
[2:15:52] annihilated. He says, "But the cosmos,
[2:15:55] the politics, the sinners, the system,
[2:15:58] sin, disease, germs, everything that's
[2:16:02] wrong will pass away." How many believes
[2:16:05] that's what lays ahead for this world.
[2:16:07] All the sinners, every germ, everything
[2:16:10] that is wrong is going to pass away.
[2:16:15] Amen.
[2:16:17] And he uses the same phrase for a
[2:16:20] believer. Now listen. So he says that's
[2:16:21] right. All that's right. God once shook
[2:16:24] the heavens, but this time he said he
[2:16:26] would shake the earth. He shook the
[2:16:28] earth, but he's going to shake the
[2:16:29] heavens also. Then he says this time he
[2:16:31] will shake the heavens. For we receive a
[2:16:34] kingdom that cannot be shaken.
[2:16:39] You're Methodists, Baptists,
[2:16:40] Presbyterians, Amish, Menanite, you're
[2:16:42] in for a shaking. Your world is going to
[2:16:44] get shook. You better be in Christ. How
[2:16:46] many believes that? Amen. That's right.
[2:16:50] The eternal kingdom. Watch now. You
[2:16:52] know, when a man received the baptism of
[2:16:54] the Holy Ghost, he says, "There's a lot
[2:16:56] of noise around there sometime." Amen.
[2:16:59] They think that it's a shame to hear
[2:17:02] people scream and shout like that. He
[2:17:04] says, "You just wait till the earth gets
[2:17:06] her baptism."
[2:17:08] Amen. You talk about a noise. That's
[2:17:11] right. There was a great noise. Isn't
[2:17:13] that right? There was no more sea. See,
[2:17:16] this will change the whole surface of
[2:17:18] the entire earth.
[2:17:20] She'll burst and blow up into pieces all
[2:17:24] the outside to crust and for hundreds of
[2:17:27] feet below it.
[2:17:30] Amen. You wonder how God's going to make
[2:17:32] all these skyscrapers and all this
[2:17:34] stuff. Where's it all going to go?
[2:17:37] There's a lot of mess on this earth,
[2:17:40] isn't it?
[2:17:41] Well, I believe he's telling us just how
[2:17:43] it's going to be. Hundreds of feet
[2:17:45] below, it'll just simply be completely
[2:17:48] demolished. The atmosphere, the gases
[2:17:50] that's in the earth now where they're
[2:17:52] finding these missiles and can't get
[2:17:54] through the great sphere. Listen to
[2:17:56] this. The great sphere up there way up
[2:18:00] in some kind of sphere, there's all
[2:18:03] kinds of gases.
[2:18:07] Brother Brian probably knows it because
[2:18:09] all of this uh freon stuff, they're
[2:18:13] worried about the ozone layer, aren't
[2:18:14] they? Way up there. Where's all of this
[2:18:18] stuff going? It's going up there.
[2:18:21] Brother Brown says it's building up.
[2:18:23] Huh?
[2:18:25] Now you see why things are going to get
[2:18:27] hot.
[2:18:29] Amen. Gases and say all kinds of gases.
[2:18:34] They say, "And that'll burst." That'll
[2:18:36] burst and the holy wrath of God will
[2:18:39] come upon it and will cleanse it and
[2:18:42] will change the entire surface. Now
[2:18:45] notice Paul used it. If you want to put
[2:18:47] it down, he says in Titus 3:5, Paul is
[2:18:50] using the same word means regeneration
[2:18:53] of man. That man is passed from a sinner
[2:18:56] to a saint. Not completely annihilated.
[2:18:58] When a man's changed, he isn't
[2:19:00] annihilated, but he's a changed person.
[2:19:04] He's been changed from what he was to
[2:19:07] what he is.
[2:19:09] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:19:14] Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh, I've been
[2:19:16] changed. I've been reborn. I've been
[2:19:20] washed by the blood of the lamb. Oh,
[2:19:23] what a difference it's made when the
[2:19:25] Lord has his way. How many's glad to be
[2:19:28] changed? I believe from glory to glory,
[2:19:31] he's changing me. Say, "God, change me.
[2:19:34] Have me ready for over there." Let me
[2:19:37] finish this. Heavens and earth have met.
[2:19:39] God and man is reconciled. A restored
[2:19:42] Eden has begun. All the curse is gone.
[2:19:45] Just like the curse of sin is gone when
[2:19:47] the Holy Spirit accepts you. Amen. How
[2:19:50] many believes that sin has lost its
[2:19:52] power? That's right. The desire for sin
[2:19:55] is gone from your heart when the Holy
[2:19:57] Spirit comes in. You are a restored
[2:20:00] person.
[2:20:02] Amen.
[2:20:03] Amen. And when the earth is restored by
[2:20:05] the same thing, there can be no more
[2:20:08] cursing, no more storms, no more winds,
[2:20:11] no more typhoons rather, rather man and
[2:20:14] God is reconciled. How many believes
[2:20:16] that a Christian Paul said, "Live in
[2:20:18] peace with all men as much as lith in
[2:20:22] you. Blessed are the peacemakers, for
[2:20:25] they shall see God." Why? Because the
[2:20:27] Christian is in living in a world of
[2:20:30] peace. Even though he's battling and
[2:20:32] battling there, but he himself is in a
[2:20:35] world of peace. Amen. How many believes
[2:20:39] that? Amen.
[2:20:42] Shouldn't be any volcanoes blowing. No
[2:20:45] storms and craziness and going wild and
[2:20:48] trouble on every side. Amen. Sure, we're
[2:20:51] trouble on every side, but not forsaken.
[2:20:53] We're locked in. God bless you this
[2:20:55] morning. Amen. Thank you for being
[2:20:57] patient with me. That's what the Lord
[2:20:59] laid on my heart. Lord, help us to be in
[2:21:01] there. How many wants to be anchored in
[2:21:02] there? Amen. So safe and secure from all
[2:21:05] alarm. Leaning on Jesus. Leaning on
[2:21:08] Jesus. Safe and secure. Amen. Stand and
[2:21:10] musicians if you'll come.
[2:21:29] Bow your heads. Close your eyes.
[2:21:32] Ask yourself
[2:21:39] if you knew you was going to be dead by
[2:21:41] tomorrow,
[2:21:44] would you be ready? Would you say, "All
[2:21:47] is well. All is well.
[2:21:50] I'm ready to go.
[2:21:53] [Music]
[2:21:55] Have you gotten anchored in Christ so
[2:21:57] much until
[2:22:00] when the storms are raging? Even as the
[2:22:02] prophet said, the storms are certainly
[2:22:05] blowing out there. The winds of war,
[2:22:10] the winds of unrest,
[2:22:13] the storms of hate,
[2:22:16] division.
[2:22:19] dissatisfied people,
[2:22:22] discontented
[2:22:24] because they haven't come to the one
[2:22:26] that causes them to be content.
[2:22:30] How many in here would wait if would
[2:22:33] just say, "Lord, take me deeper in you.
[2:22:36] Take me deeper in you, Lord. Let me hide
[2:22:39] myself in thee. Rock of Ages,
[2:22:43] hide myself in thee. Let me hide myself
[2:22:45] in this." God bless those hands, Lord
[2:22:48] Jesus. every heart no doubt in here this
[2:22:50] morning wants to be so sealed in. Lord,
[2:22:53] until the devil doesn't have any right.
[2:22:55] He can't go in there. He can't torment
[2:22:57] them. He can't depress them. He can't
[2:23:00] bring all these things into their hearts
[2:23:02] because they're sealed in safe and
[2:23:05] secure from all alarm. We ask God that
[2:23:08] you'll bless every heart this morning,
[2:23:10] Lord. Every hand that is raised, we
[2:23:13] surrender to you completely, Lord. We
[2:23:16] believe you with all of our heart, mind,
[2:23:18] soul, and strength. You are our all in
[2:23:20] all. And we ask God this morning, Lord
[2:23:23] Jesus, that you'll look beneath every
[2:23:25] hand and every heart, Lord, and help
[2:23:27] each one to be ready, Lord, to live
[2:23:30] daily ready.
[2:23:33] Live in peace,
[2:23:35] Lord, wherever they are in their homes,
[2:23:37] God, when they sit, when they eat, when
[2:23:39] they ride, when they drive, God, that
[2:23:41] they'll have that peace of God in their
[2:23:44] hearts that passes understanding.
[2:23:47] It's the very peace of God. It's the
[2:23:49] very peace that God possesses. May the
[2:23:52] each one of us this morning possess that
[2:23:54] same peace. The very joy that God
[2:23:57] possesses is on the inside of us because
[2:23:59] we have a portion of God in our hearts.
[2:24:02] And we thank you for this, Lord. And it
[2:24:04] makes us the happiest people in the
[2:24:07] world, Lord.
[2:24:09] God, I pray Lord, if there's any that is
[2:24:11] drugged down by the cares of life, that
[2:24:15] is still burdened, Lord Jesus, that is
[2:24:17] still weary,
[2:24:19] that is still troubled, Lord, and is not
[2:24:21] there, God. May they raise their hand,
[2:24:23] God, I'm not there, and I want to be. I
[2:24:25] want to be there,
[2:24:27] Lord Jesus, take, God, just now. Hands
[2:24:30] that are raised, Lord, that'll be
[2:24:32] honest. They're not where they want to
[2:24:33] be, and they shouldn't be, God, but they
[2:24:34] want to be. I ask God that they would be
[2:24:38] able to open their hearts and their
[2:24:40] minds by faith and enter there and say,
[2:24:43] "God, I'm yours." No matter what comes,
[2:24:46] no matter what the future holds, we hold
[2:24:49] the one that holds the future. Bless
[2:24:51] them now, Father, in the name of Jesus
