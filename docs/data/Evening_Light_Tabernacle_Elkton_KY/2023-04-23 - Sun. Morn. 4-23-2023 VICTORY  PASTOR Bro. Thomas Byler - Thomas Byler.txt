I'm going to start in verse 20 it's just a talking about right before the angels went down to Sodom there for him but God destroyed Solomon start in verse 20. 18 20 and the Lord said because the Christ Sodom and Gomorrah is great and become because their sin is very Grievous we'll go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the crime which is coming to me and if not I will know and then turn their faces from thence and went towards Autumn but Abraham stood yet before the Lord and Abraham Drew near and said will thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked pear Adventure there be 50 righteous but then the city let thought destroy and not spare the space for the place for the 50 righteous that are therein that be far from the do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the Earth do right and the Lord said if I find the Sodom 50 righteous within the city then I will spare all the police for this for their sakes and Abraham asked and said behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord which am but dust and Ashes per Adventure there Sherlock five of the 50 righteous will thou destroy all of the city for the lack of five and he said if I find they're 40 and 5 I will not destroy it he spoke unto him yet again and said prayer Venture there Jean be 40 found there and he said I will not do it for the 40s sake and he said unto him oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak Fair eventually there shall Thirty be found and he said I will not do it if I find Thirty there he said behold I know I've taken upon me to speak unto the Lord Prayer Adventure there shall be 20 found he said I will not destroy for 20's sake and he said oh let not the Lord be angry and they'll speak but this once prayer Venture 10 shall be found there and he said I will not destroy it for the Ten's sake and the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place and what happened to the city it was destroyed and so the conclusion I guess would be that there wasn't 10 righteous found in the city so that goes back to kind of where we are standing today um the sad place out there in the world it was a sad place in Noah's day it was a sad place in the day of Sodom and Gomorrah and it's a sad place getting ready making itself ready for Destruction today as well we'll just continue here let's see see your Matthew 13 if you want to go with me you can and if you don't we'll just read it and yeah let's see I don't think we Matthew 13. 9 we'll start in nine he who had ears to hear Let Him hear and the disciples came and said unto him why speak is done to thou unto them in Parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of time of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever have not from him shall be taken away from that he hath therefore be guide to them in Parables because they're seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiahs which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is racks gross and their ears are dull a hearing in their eyes they have closed lest any time they should see with their eyes hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear primarily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them you know if we'll go to Revelations 4 no actually Revelations 3. Revelations 3 starting in verse 14. and unto the angel of the Church of the lady was the ends write these things saith amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God and I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot a word that thou work cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I was Beauty out of my mouth because thou sayest I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing know it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment and thou mayest be clothed and at the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and I know it dies with isaf that thou mayest see as many as I love are broken Jason bezel their form repent if you hold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with the father my father in his throne he to have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and we want our ears to be open and our eyes to be open in this day we've we never got all the way through Matthew 24 last time but well it seemed very hard in time here but I got a couple quotes here basically again just looking at where we are in the transition of time we're we're in a late hour um as Jesus said in in 24 there he said he said as it was in the days of Sodom as it was in the days of Noah so shall be in the days of this coming of the son of man so we want our ears to be alert and our eyes to be open to be ready to leave this world because one thing for sure we don't want to stay in this world um it's obviously getting worse and well it's it's bad but um we don't want to be here when when God takes to come to take his bride home we don't want to be left behind uh brother Brandon says here and the other thing is just we have something special uh to just be able to see that God did send a prophet in this day for many people can't see it talking about eyes to hear and ears are here's to hear and eyes to see most people can't see it you can you can wave it to it in front of their face they won't see it they most people chop the scriptures up to what make it say whatever they want it to say and uh goes back to where Jesus told uh or Abraham when talking about the rich man in Abraham he said let me go back let me go back and raise from the dead and go tell my brothers he said not to come to this place and Abraham said they have uh they have the prophets they said he said if one rose from the dead and went and told him they still wouldn't believe and that's kind of where we are brother I'm speaking here he said but I believe that the great calling on the Rival in America has been turned down by the American people in whole they just can't they just simply can't conceive perceive rather the word There's Been Enough gospel preached in the form of the word Across America to have this country a second guard I mean Garden of Eden Eden but they turn it down the great evangelist he's talking about Billy Graham Jack Schuler and many of the other great men Oral Roberts across the country preaching the gospel God working Holy Spirit moving upon the people and them accepting they say accepting Christ is the as their personal Savior and they go Savior and they go right back into the wallow of the world just like they was in the first place and now times that times so many more we have 50 years on this side when brother Branham left preaching the word the the pure unadulterated word and they still go back to the wallow of the world and he goes on to see what the church needs tonight is not new members why the United States is combed over and over by so many evangelists until it's just a burnt territory that's the truth America is absolutely sin to wait it's day of Grace you mark it down on a book he'll never have a universal Revival in America it passed that about three years ago it'll never be a Revival some of you people Mark uh the word down for that there'll never be a nationwide Revival no more like like in the days of old he said and so forth you'll have a little spurt UPS like that until Jesus comes but it will never be Nationwide one God has turned from it he's gone to the foreign Nations that's where the uh that's where the people come one sign from the Lord done thousands and run to the altar of the thousands of heathens will run to alter and it can be done over and over to this bunch of Americans that's been taught this way that way and they're all confused up and they never stop to look in their Bible that's the thing they they always push that we're looking to a man or following a man but there are a lot of times following more of a man's ideas because if they just take what what's heard and take it back to the scriptures and search it out they'd see for themselves but they don't even do the due diligence to do that uh he said the Bible is the word of God it's given to the people to feed on why you got so many ways drawn up it's got to be this way it's got to be the way my church says it's got to be the way my church says and when Jesus come the first time it was all together all together different from what their churches was saying and it'll be all together different from what they're saying today when he comes again because he said he said I've hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and will reveal it in the babes such as we'll learn if you're willing to learn take the Bible and search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me said Jesus and them you think you have eternal life and they testify of me and now and know when he come the ministry was so Supernatural to a blind in the eyes of the preachers of that day they couldn't see it they said I'm telling them people what's wrong with them and telling them their names and things that's a devil's Spirit on them it's Beelzebub Jesus said I'll forgive you for that but someday when the Holy Spirit comes he said doing the same thing the one one word against it will never be forgiven in this world or the world to come and brother Brandon says watch Sodom he said now he said as it was in the days of Noah blasphemers and so forth and as it was in the days of Sodom is when the fire fell fire is going to fall this time not water fire the fire will fall from Heavens the Bible says so those volcanic gases that's up there some of these days they're going to push up one of them missiles through there it's going to set a chain around like that perhaps and that's the way it'll come it's at hand we know it can't be much longer science says three minutes well that was then now they say 90 seconds so one minute and a half so it's cut and a half science says longer before midnight the clock will strike one of these hours and it'll be gone within just a few minutes the world will be on fire but before that happens he said the church is going to glory and then at the end of that if then if the end time is that close the coming of the Lord is closer so he says so what are we doing we're sitting watching these things we go home wasn't that amazing and that's not the way to do it he said grab scriptures start through it with prayer in Your Heart Lord God is it that close help me oh Lord hope to Know Thy word and search it and lean up over it and stay with it and miss a few meals and pray to God and you'll come back to the church so charged with the power of God things will will be going to take place around here we got to have it we see the marking Abraham see how it was given to Abraham Abrams Abraham seen that sign before the fire fell and Sodom and Abraham said a seed will see the same sign but for the flowers fall in the modern Sodom of today and we've done seen the sign signed the Abraham scene was the one brother Brown said where Sarah was in the tent he said why did Sarah laugh and we've seen that sign many times so it's getting ready to be going home time so by God's grace we all want to be ready don't want to be left here I know that brother Josh God bless you thank you man let's stay on this morning I've been can we sing that song ready to leave from the twinkling of an eye some

think the next week it's going to be pretty much ideal amen as far as the weather is concerned nice cool weather amen's been certainly been nice amen but appreciate the Sunday School just each one that has a part this morning amen God bless you amen I can't think of any announcements so let's just go before the Lord in prayer kind Heavenly Father we come before you Lord once again Lord thank the Lord to be able to come to your house Lord just lay aside all of our thoughts and everything Lord Jesus of our years of life Lord we know truth Lord and absolute Lord Jesus and we just asked God that you would come in a special way Lord and speak to us one again Lord by the way of your spirit Lord get me out of the way that you might just want to say what you once said Lord Jesus this morning and do what you want to do Lord we ask God did you come in a special way this morning and visit with us this morning Father Lord in this service today as we Endeavor Lord Jesus just to speak your word Lord what we feel you've laid Upon Our Hearts to speak God and as we have assembled ourselves together Lord we've gotten ourselves ready Lord and coming to your house and prayed and asked that you'd come and say we see the lateness of the hour father and and Lord the closeness of your coming Lord and we don't want to be left behind and father so we come Lord presenting ourselves before you saying Lord if there's any evil way in this Lord we ask God that you would take your uh your great eye Lord and just see down there Lord and take out anything that's unlike you father bless the reading of the word now for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and bless those listening also amen amen that are out there amen that are tuning in this morning amen I want to kind of continue amen it's not it's going to be on the same line as what we was speaking on uh Wednesday but it'll be a little bit different amen and so we just trust the Lord will have his way enjoy Tommy's little Tommy's uh lesson I mean I don't know if you all watched that but that was really good amen and brother Danny Thursday so we just appreciate it we're looking forward to Lord willing amen maybe go to the meetings me and Caleb maybe go over there to Virginia Thursday amen and be down there for a couple days Amen in the meetings down there we hadn't gone that way in a while so we may be Lord willing uh like to go so amen but Lord willing I'll be back we amen for Sunday so I don't know why my voice wants to act this way but it's been kind of acting up so amen I think we'll get it straightened out here in a minute amen praise the Lord amen turn your bibles if you will and then we'll go to the book of Corinthians I believe it is let me see I believe it's First Corinthians 15 First Corinthians 15. I've got me a change the way I'm gonna do things amen instead of having one of them yellow tablets I got me a book amen so you that way I can have this page this page and I've got this page this page I got four pages this morning so hey man we'll see if that worked out for me amen praise the Lord but anyway so God bless you richly this morning God is just very good isn't it aren't you glad that you're living on the hallelujah hallelujah side amen because there's certainly a side that is in Hallelujah but I'm glad to be living on the Hallelujah side aren't you amen this morning we want to speak about Victory amen amen I've kind of wanted to speak on this for a little bit it kind of pulled that way as you could probably tell amen and talking about overcoming in Victory and so forth but I want to just take this and talk about Victory amen and how that we can have Victory amen in Christ Jesus and that's why I want brother Josh to Joshua to sing that song Oh Victory in Jesus my Savior forever amen in First Corinthians 15 and verse 51. and uh we'll begin there now this may seem like a funeral text but we're certainly not going there amen behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of it and I at the last Trump for the Trump trumpet shall sound for this corruption didn't must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruption shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory amen so we see that word Victory associated with the resurrection amen amen at last how many know The Last Enemy that is to be defeated is death itself right and natural death all right amen oh death Paul says o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory this thing of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us to Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen therefore my brethren my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable amen how you like that how many beliefs that's how we ought to be willing to be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be uh see that yes you know what's coming right so praise the Lord you know I was just thinking about this and of course I was thinking of how much this here scripture actually parallels another Resurrection amen another resurrection and I didn't even think about it till I uh uh began to read in verse 51 there how about how did he says you know um behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep amen and so I got to thinking of how that Paul's the day that sleep sleep in the night amen and they that are in darkness and so forth you know that they're sleeping we know that the whole world is space particularly asleep amen and then uh then it also talks about of course how did this corruption must put on incorruption and so forth this Mortal must put on immortality death must be swallowed up in Victory amen and so I thought you know actually you and I I believe uh Jesus said one place he said you know that he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die amen amen so how many believed spiritually you and I have already experienced a resurrection spiritually speaking amen spiritually speaking you and I have already put on incorruption amen because it talks about being born again I've got that seat that's quickened on the inside amen and guess what we already have triumphant and come up in Victory you and I already have Victory in Jesus praise God Amen I'm gonna go over here now I this is I won't say off the subject because it's not really but uh I just thought of this whenever I was studying and I thought I want to bring this out amen because it just certainly has to do with being Victorious amen now notice how it talks about you know corruption put on incorruption you know and we must be raised from the dead and so forth but you know in Ephesians the second chapter he says and you hath he quickened who were dead amen I believe Once Upon a Time spiritually you and I were dead the whole world is dead I man we're born in sin shaped and liquidity basically born dead amen but he has quickened us or made us alive where in times past you will walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air that worketh now and the children of Disobedience among whom also you had your conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind amen and War by Nature the children of Wrath even as others amen so how many knows that one time maybe we were living by the desires of the flesh we did whatever the flesh desired amen and and so forth and of the mind and we're by Nature notice the word Nature by nature in other words we had the nature of the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together in Christ amen and has raised us up together and has made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen he's taking you from the Lolly Wally Woos or the the the the the Wally grubs I think some of us say and everything else amen and all the blues and he has given you and set you in Heavenly places amen you know just before I got that come out I had this thought you know and I thought about how that we really and I I feel like that if you're born again and you have the Holy Spirit a lot of time we don't even realize what we have you don't even realize what you got amen and the only way to really get all of all of that you can out from the holy spirit is to cultivate the spirit isn't that right we're going to talk with a little bit this morning with the help of the Lord about the black dog and the white dog also you know because when we're talking about Victory we're talking about overcoming something right talking about overcoming and we know that already Jesus said in every Church age at the end of whatever he said to him he always said to him that overcometh will I get out to sit with me in my throne amen and I wrote down here and I'm just going to get started here I wrote down here once upon a time long long ago amen many ages ago there lived the people amen and they lived not in Victory but they lived in defeat and also I'll throw this in here as I wrote this down 98 percent it's not an accurate estimation because it's probably a a higher number than 98. but I just put about 98 that that would be my guesstimation of people and all of Christendom all that claims to be Christian amen that claims to be Christian live in defeat they live in defeat amen because even Jesus said if I don't shorten the days no flesh shall be saved amen these few there be that find it by the band the way he talked about it he says man there's just going to be a few that are going to make that rapture wow it's scary almost is how he makes it sound but you know into such because you claim Christianity doesn't mean that you're living in Victory and that's what we want I don't know about you but that's what I want I want to live in Victory don't we all want to live a Victorious Christian Life long long ago in the land Far Far Away many ages ago as a matter of fact it's been around 2 000 years ago amen for 4 000 years people had to live in defeat now they had many victories isn't that right amen we talk about David think about David and how did he had a great victory over Goliath and all the victories that he had but with all the victories that he had he still had to live and defeat you have to live in defeat you couldn't live any other way but in defeat why because if they had been living in Victory why would we have needed Christ huh you know no matter how many great victories he had he still failed the Bathsheba is that right he was still defeated and even if he perhaps wouldn't have fell in that way it doesn't matter they still had that sin on the inside that carnal nature was still in there amen we want to deal with that with the help of the Lord now how many knows that uh you think about that I think about him I think about David I think about shamgar I mean those they had many deliverers in the Book of Judges you can go through the Book of Judges and there's uh you know uh what was it Gideon and Samson and all these different people that God raised up to be there to deliver and they would deliver them they would get delivered huh they would have Victory but they would always fall back in defeat Joshua think about Joshua the Great Mighty Warrior he was a mighty warrior but he took him over across the promised land and how many knows that they ended up completely sinning and completely being done away with by God and going to all the nations of the world it was terrible and I think about a lot of times Christians that claim to be Christians is that right we can claim to be Christians and we might have a victory or two but why would we always fall back into defeat huh I don't believe we have to do you I believe Christ came to change that in our life he wants you to live in Victory and notice how Paul said you know oh death he talked about even death where's your sting I'm not afraid of you anymore and you don't scare me anymore you don't have a sting anymore but I thank God who Christ do God who gives us the victory how many believe that's what Christ come for is to give us victory oh Hallelujah we know that when Christ came what did you he defeated every devil there ever was Amen in the third or fourth chapter of Matthew when he was tempted with the lust of the Flesh and lust of the eye and the kind of life and all these temptations that the devil come out of me and overcome every one of them he come over come epilepsy he overcome blindness he overcome the every Temptation everything that everyone wants he overcome he was Victorious he was triumphant over all of them amen he all and all the way to the Grave even Jesus oh my talking about prayer being a real powerful uh tool in the hands of a real Warrior if you really want to see a warrior overcoming you'll find him on their knees is that right I mean those Jesus in the garden amen he overcame and that brother bam said he was his greatest test amen whether he would overcome himself in other words not my will he says well if it'd be possible let this type it was so hard on this place she wanted to have to do this and it was a real battle but he overcoming The Garden of Gethsemane and remember even Jesus said to disciples he said pray with me that you fall not in Temptation amen how many believe you you're not going to fall in Temptation it takes prayer it takes like I said King staying in tune with almighty God if you're gonna be a mighty Victorious Warrior amen you're going to have to absolutely stay in tune because if you don't the white dog will get weaker the black dog gets stronger amen now we know that their nature in the Old Testament wasn't changed that was their that was their problem every no matter how many times it would come in awe for their sacrifices and so forth their nature would still be the same how many beliefs you and I have to have a nature before you can actually be victorious you have to have a nature change now I know brother Phil's been here and he's ministered Brother Brad said at different places and we talk about the flesh isn't that right we talk about the flesh we talk about this spirit and and uh you know how that how that even though your nature even even though you're born again isn't that right even though you're born again now that Spirit on the inside has changed the desires has changed but this flesh it still has the same desires it always has on it it doesn't change the desires of your flesh but it does to change the desires of your spirit and your soul amen so let's look at that with just the help of the Lord for a minute now let's look at that I've got about four or five different places I'd like to go amen and look at things this morning but amen remember they had the law in the Old Testament didn't they they had the law okay and that law Paul said was holy is that right sure he said that law was holy their enrollments we're going to go to Romans 8 here real quick we're going to look at this let's take our time going too fast already and Paul talked about this in chapter 7 just before he talked about the flesh because first of all let me just say this as we talked about Victory how many knows that uh you could uh you could move mountains with faith Paul said in First Corinthians and so forth but if you haven't got the love of God in your heart all of that doesn't do any good amen in Israel if you think about it Israel amen no matter how much law the law was holy but they they weren't holy amen so let's just read it chapter 7 and we'll begin with uh let me see what I've got marked down here 7 and 12. wherefore notice the law is Holy is Holy and just and good Thou shalt not steal that's good Thou shalt not commit adultery that's good Thou shalt not covet the neighbor's things amen all this is all good is that right was then that which is good made death unto me God forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death in Me by that which is good that sin by commandment might become exceedingly sinful now here's the point I want to get to for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal Soul under sin so now we see why that Israel always Was Defeated isn't that right okay could never keep the Commandments because their nature was completely contrary to it amen praise be to God now I didn't finish my thought here a minute ago when I was beginning to talk about Israel my point that I want to get to First is first of all the greatest enemy we have we know is ourself is that right so that's what we have to be victorious over thirst everything else is insignificant you have to conquer yourself amen that's what we want victory over and I I was back there thinking you know uh of what we really have if what we really what we're what we're capable of what the possibilities of us uh as as Christians are but there's a lot of times things that hold us back isn't that right and that is of course our flesh it's like that sound barrier the prophet of God talked about if you could ever break that sound barrier if you ever can get past your flesh amen then all things are possible to them that believe if you say to this mountain move it'll be moved how many believe that if you could just actually him completely conquer ourselves because I'll tell you this right now I believe we're coming close to the coming of the Lord and I believe the pride is to be a Victorious bride an invincible Army something that the devil doesn't know what to do with that's why I tying it in with Lindsay talking about all these different channels avenues that the Devil comes at you she takes your ears smell concentration memory and all of those things but you got to have the soldier the Holy Ghost on the Forefront guarding the devil that's a roaring lion to keep him from coming in any of those channels that's why you don't stand a chance without the Holy Ghost because Christ is our Victory how many believe he is our Victory but I want to look at with the help of the Lord this morning is what is in Christ that gives you the power to overcome and listen to this even though you have the Holy Ghost you don't overcome everything right then and there no no you don't always you know because you don't how many knows we've had the Holy Ghost but many times we have failed to overcome things but if you'll surrender yourself and I thought I thought this was so awesome because amen I believe it says uh our general was coming to Richmond and they were saying well how are we going to take a Richmond how are we going to take Richmond he says we're going to take Richmond just as we come to it amen they had not lead to such a flow of victory that hey when we get there we'll take care of it the Americans and the and the allies when World War II we had gotten into such a group that when we come into Germany we come into one city to another and we come to another and we was coming to get you we was coming through and nobody could stop us they were in the groove of Victory and I believe that's what you and I want this morning let's get in the groove of Victory amen and get the devil anything that comes your way and then overcome it as it comes just as it comes as your Bibles comes as God allows things to come to your way amen overcoming because if you don't overcome it you're gonna suffer the agony of the feet and there's a whole lot of Christians that are suffering amen that are in the agony and despair and the miserableness of defeat hmm I refuse to be living in defeat how about you I refuse to live in defeat you don't have to but the devil wants you to he doesn't care how much people go to church how much message you claim or how many books you know or what you do he just wants you to live and defeat and you do one or the other how many beliefs we live in either we're living in the thrill of victory or we're living in the agony of defeat and Israel could never overcome it they always had that emptiness just like you and I did when we were out in the world we always had that emptiness that horrible feeling but you ain't gotta have that horrible feeling anymore because you've got the comforter now no matter what they would do they should never be satisfied amen they would never have that Comfort but you and I've got that comfort in our lives whoo oh my we don't know what we got but I want to know more about it don't you but you got to conquer your mind you got to conquer your flesh you got to conquer every thought that comes into your mind be victorious bringing into captivity every thought making it subject to the word of God Amen like we said Wednesday like the prophet of God said in the greatest battle that was ever fought you know as soon as something comes up and your feeling is not according to the word let me tell you to my wife once and she said you know at a certain point in that service you know she felt like that old an old Spirit we tried to get on her tried to jump on her and she just rebuked it amen I'll tell you what I believe Wednesday there's some Devil's cast out amen whenever you realize that you're having a feeling that shouldn't be there and you realize yeah that's not in the word of God oh it does you can feel it you can see the effects of it oh my he'll try to jump in your mind and your thoughts and devil is real folks but it can be cast out by the power of the word of God because remember remember the sword of the spirit which we want to get into it but you have it all the armor of God that we want to get into and then the last is and have the sword of the spirit which is the word of God folks how many has ever watched an old movie of where they used to have swords and decided in the other and they'd be sitting around the campfire amen sitting around the campfires I'm wearing they had their big sword and for you what you doing I'm sharpening my sword because you don't want to go to battle with a dull sword folks when I'm going to come and when I hit that hand in me I want you I want his head to come from off I want a sharp sword how many believes that you and I are here this morning to sharpen our swords amen so that when you meet him tomorrow wherever you meet him I mean you can say get that behind me Satan cut him right off and say you ain't got no right here oh I tell you what this is a nervous erotic in the depressed age but you ain't gotta be nervous you ain't got to be depressed you ain't got to live like that soon as the devil tries to keep your Victory from you you take it back amen praise be to God I like that oh my all right now notice and then of course Paul goes down there and he says oh Wretched Man now that I'm a man every time I want to do good I don't do it in this out of the other isn't that right but in chapter 8 he says this no ma he said but there is now enough for no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of Christ has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak to the Flesh in other words the law wanted to make them holy the law wanted to make them right isn't that right sure it did but he could not do it because it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and forcing condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit for that or after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh isn't that the truth give me a big old amen then I walk after the flesh your mind to sing to the Flesh and that's why we ain't got Victory because I've been thinking about the flesh do my laughs folk I'm telling you what if you kept your mind more on Christ and you prayed more all week long our service would be different than what they are you coming here you'd have a fire you would just have a little fire you'd have a pillar of Fire if nothing must bring a little bit of fire I'm telling you the spirit of God healing half let the praise of his people without the pillar of fire we're not Christ come down amen I'll tell you the sick will get healed the backside will raise up baby and I'll tell you what Christ can do stuff but if you are of carnal if you mind the things of the flesh you're still walking in the flesh I'm so glad that we ain't got to walk in this flesh anymore amen amen I'm gonna I'm gonna make a statement and preacher said something here now I got it right to correct a little bit but it's truth or trust to an extent that your flesh's desires are just as strong as your spirits desires huh it's like a 50 50. there's truth to an extent but I'm also glad that the person said you know that you don't have to cater to the flesh that flesh can be defeated if you'll give the spirit 55 . amen it'll bring your flesh into subjection and it'll keep them desires amen of the Flesh and check and it'll take that black dog and it'll find him across his neck and it'll chew him up he'll bite him and fight him and I'll tell you what you ain't gonna be depressed anymore you're gonna have joy on speakable and full of Glory but you gotta feed that white dog you gotta live in the spirit not in the flesh you got to think the right thoughts amen for dinner after the flesh you mind the things of the flesh but dinner after the spirits the things of the spirit hallelujah what you ever think you're true whatsoever things are lovely whatever things are a good report is there any any praise if there'd be any virtue speak about anything think about these things make the Holy Ghost she's always positive it's never negative we're just getting started how many place we can climb so higher than we are I can climb so much higher we there's so much more here but you're gonna have to die to that flesh a little bit you're gonna have to kill that guy amen oh victory I wouldn't have my smile on my face If I Was Defeated I wouldn't have joy in my heart if I was this either defeated I wouldn't have peace in my heart if I was defeated folks I'm here to tell you I want to ask everybody in here check yourself have you got the piece that passes I understand have you got joy unspeakable and full of all right or you feel that Agony of defeat if you do don't let this service pass by but you can ask God to give you the victory through Jesus Christ [Music] folks sometimes though oh I'll tell you what right now the Holy Spirit and those who are might be in triumphant they don't always look like they're Mighty and triumphant no David which is already a little fella wasn't he he didn't look like nothing even if Jesus even even said Jesus he was calmly amen there was no Beauty in him that we would desire him naturally speaking there was he was nothing to look at but he had power to walk on water he had power to raise hazardous from the dead and I'm telling you right now it might not look like my dumbbell Was Defeated amen Saints of all the ages down through the Dark Ages whenever they were being said to Lions and the women the children and everybody else amen go out there it looked like they were defeated but they were not defeated they were defined principalities and the powers amen they were they've been sitting in Christ amen and sits on the right hand of God and if you are in Christ every principle is under you if you're the weakest Christian there is if you're in Christ every devil is under your feet he's under my feet he's under my feet Satan is under my feet boy I don't know about you but I like that that gets me think that all of that depression and everything else the devil tries to put on you can be under your feet amen you love him that's where the victory is search Within look inward amen oh I got to thinking about this how that Israel couldn't have it they couldn't have it if they tried sure they had victories they had Goliath this fall dad Jack always fall balls fall but still that same sorrow in their heart still defeated in their heart no wonder they went back no wonder they went back and back and back and back huh good lesson for us isn't it no wonder people go back and go back go back because they got defeated their heart I don't want no defeat in my heart God help us oh my help us to be like the Mighty Warriors before us amen all right they're after the things of the spirit for to be commonly minded It's death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace amen brother as we get older the desire that we used to like stuff just isn't there anymore is it the Bible talks about when your desire when you get older your desire fails huh you know all the things that we thought was so awesome and great and this out of the other and you know folks I'm really backslid I mean I didn't even go hunt turkey yet I used to be out there the first day I had to be out there and I was hunting I was all a young robot and I'm like not all so don't know about it anymore it's just a bird folks I'd almost rather be putting the two by four together giving me an extra storage shed or something you know and other things how many desire fails the real Zeal of life begins to not be there but let me tell you when you get spiritually minded and you realize one of these days so we're going to a land where we're better go out we're going to an eternal place then life comes back all right like that old man up there amen and Preacher Man 80 years old I mean he come out there they talk about the rainbow just out of the other click this truth they got it begin they have a little life back I mean between you we need to be Lively Stones the Bible said We're Not Dead songs we're Lively songs oh my he's alive he's alive he's alive I'm forgiven not that just he's alive but I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive I'm forgiven how many he's alive this morning your religion don't have a little emotion maybe you ought to go out there and have a funeral bury it how many believe that I get enthused just thinking about this stuff why because it's the right thoughts how many at least you need to think the right thoughts oh my praise be to God all right why because they had the same carnality amen you can never be a Christian walking after the flesh you can never be a Christian have be carnally minded you have to be spiritually minded amen because of carnal mind is enmity against God and it is not subject to God neither the law indeed can be so that they that are in the flesh they cannot please God well if you just took that the wrong way you think well I'm In the Flesh I'll never please God what does Paul say the very next verse verse 9 but ye are not in the flesh how many believe you don't live from satisfy the flesh you're there to satisfy and live in the spirit but because the flashes were the only thing that's left to be redeemed is his body oh my I was thinking and I hope this I shouldn't never say this but I guess I didn't open the bag already but I was thinking what's the difference between a born-again Christian and his accessibility to the powers of God what's the difference between you and Jesus there's only one difference there's one difference because we know our Soul's been redeemed I know that we have every right that Adam lost we have every right to speak to the trees and everything else we have every right to all of the Bibles every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every Lion The Works that I do shall you do also but what's the difference there's only one difference and that is his body was perfect he was perfect you and I were we not you and I aren't we're still subject to failure it's the only difference it's all right but aren't you glad that oh my I'm gonna have failures and I'm gonna stumble and then no don't just stay down there you get back up again cause you've got the same Authority that Jesus did how many believe that God gave you power he gave you authority over every devil and you have every right and everything that Christ had you have makes me want to jump and shout and I don't know what all that think we've been restored to every right oh my what was it one time a lady asked if you don't know what her sickness was but it was pretty sincere and after she was prayed for she just says Nah you gotta go huh how many leaves that's the way ought to be with us we get sick this Saturday I don't know I've prayed and I've asked God to heal me and our devil get out out of here now amen and they go on like it's done already I don't care if you fall over dead act like it's not already getting better bam says Scott can never do anything for you took a whole sermon on one time until you accept for this that it's done already can't do nothing Gloria said it is finished now you have to say it's done because he said it's done now our contention has to be the confession of what he said now what your body tells you [Music] [Applause] know it I'm gonna stop and read your story about 15 years ago the BAM says I was standing in this platform here with a great big old chart teaching I like that and there's a little Pentecostal group came from Louisville and I never did believe in them people dancing the way that they did and there's a little up here to play Anna and they was going to play a little special and beat on the 10 symbols on a washboard and some of them beat on a tin can and I was very much a Critic of it I thought well now what's going to happen and the woman came up to play the special she got in the play and the lady got the beaten on the washboard I mean we need a little beat sometimes hello oh and the lady got the washboard and this little blonde headed girl jumped out on the floor began to dance in the spirit and me sitting there weren't full and I said now I wish I could look at that I've been telling my church till they were wondering what I was going to do about it I kept looking at her and I thought oh look at that now if that isn't something making my my making a Tavern out of my church now sitting there not knowing any better and I wasn't seeing anything but in my heart I was thinking that so I watched her there while she was dancing the first thing you know I said now wait a minute I wonder if the ladies got any scripture for that and I began to think about the scripture I said where was dancing never ordained at in the first place in the Bible I thought well what made them dance and I see that the children of Israel when they crossed the Red Sea Miriam looked back and seen all of those Taskmaster Strouds and she picked up a tambourine at the beginning of dance let me tell you when you see all them Devils that bother you when they don't bother you no more you begin to shout and sing love me to God no you haven't seen this ever tormented you everything that's ever bothered you when it's dead amen is under your feet you'll begin to dance [Music] very high still tied down she'll chain down huh I don't know people are too chained now amen a lot of times our problems ain't a lot of our jobs out of our money making a lot of our I am in our flesh amen it's got us tie down we came around no tree we can't get up all out more and shut it down for a minute and do a little dance all around it because we're thinking too much about what we gotta do next instead of thinking about him all right amen is the Lord oh my been again beat on that tambourine run down the shores dancing and the daughters of Israel followed her dancing I thought that's mecray I've seen David his little sweetheart sitting up there behind this fan Fanning looking at his her cute little boyfriend Dave is sitting out there and here comes the ark and as brother Graham talked a while ago coming across the hill when David's here and he coming he dancing around and around and around and right why she said you embarrassed me he says if you don't like that watch this and around and around around he went you went you not look down from heaven said David you are [Music] a dark feet help as we depart from your ball that God could look out and say Yes man after my own heart he gets inspired he gets enthused about the word of God coming back and being restored again I don't know too much aren't you glad that the word's been restored to us you ain't gotta be out there groping your Darkness you ain't got to be asleep anymore you're wide awake and you're going to heaven amen God is redeemed you got to save your soul oh yeah That's my boy That's my boy he's after my own heart that's what I like hey man David you're a man after a morning that's right and I thought you know there's one thing that's the matter with me maybe I haven't got victory I haven't got Victory a month foreign out of you laughs [Music] all right aren't you glad we don't know I won't even go to it this morning but remember set the fruit of the flesh these are the works of the flesh all these ugly things had terrible things amen Stripes Edition all these other things but the spirit amen against such there is no law oh suffering patience means temperance godliness Peter said if these things be in you they make you you neither bear noron fruitful amen and if you think being you they make you that you shall never come on Peter really you have to put the never word in yeah he may never fall you keep these things on the front and I'll tell you what the devil won't get into you he won't be able to do no he won't know what to do with you it feels good [Music] better than any Budweiser ever did any dope ever did oh aren't you glad for the power of the Holy Ghost it's your opium crushed by the lily of the valley and then take it into you it'll give you a little bit of zeal it'll make you a Lively Stone well it's the Holy Ghost in fine it's keeping me alive keeping me alive the Holy Ghost is keeping me alive laughs all right amen I didn't expect to get this happy about it but I just like to be myself thank you all for letting me be myself that thank you for letting me come to church and enjoy myself hey man I ain't had this good of time all week I don't think this ought to be your best times under the anointing of the Holy Spirit Christ come and I said God Christ I wanted to come this morning and speak to us come down and saturate us this morning you're welcome you come father we welcome you this morning come and do what you always do let go people let go of the Flesh and take a hold of the spirit and you'll be Overcomers you'll have the victory because that's your biggest battle it's not my mother it's not my brother it's not my sister but it's me oh Lord needing the victory want me to finish the story and I thought you know that's what I need I need more Victory and I got the sitting there my method is foot got the patent Ina and the first thing you know God might judge before I knew what I was doing I was out there on the floor that's in the wrong with that girl oh I know there's no critics in the church he ought to be dancing around with a girl huh hey we're all just having a good time in the spirit it ain't no unclean this year just pure Holy Ghost dancing in the spirit there he was I imagine congregation thought whoa our pastor has done lost it I can only imagine what them folks thought because you know brother Brandon really didn't teach that all that much before this he was critical all of a sudden he got to realizing you know I remember all those things that bothered me I remember all those Devils that tried to keep me down and knowledge of Jesus whatever I went to that words and I said God if you can help me save my sinner save me a sinner and he walked away and with all that load lifted he began to worship God and I want you to know I don't I want you you've got the Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that say the rats like me that's all I have to have to worship God for a trillion years and just because he saved a Wretch like Thomas no count and he saved me out of the millions that are out there lost his sin and shame and that are dying and God's Gonna destroy all of mankind but he's gonna spare those that call upon his name how many slapped that he's going to spare some of us yes he's gonna spare praise be to God you love him Hallelujah oh my God that's right God take me then I said God take me out of Deceit it is scornful let me look at anything sensibly before I pass judge me more God does things peculiar now I don't believe in a lot of nonsense I don't believe in a lot of this Tommy rot but I believe in the real genuine Spirit-filled Holy Ghost word of God being preached in the power and demonstration amen that's the thing that saved me that's the thing that has brought me thus this are amen that's the thing that has helped me when every doctor said that I was dying that's the thing that saved me in the hour of my death how many he was he was writing to death and his heart was beating so slow and all of his blood was on the pan being so slow and they said he's gonna go he's leaving he's leaving he was just about gone and God spared him hey man he had something to praise God about that's the thing that'll resurrect me that's the thing that I'll go to heaven with if I ever get there oh my I'll have to go buy it because I don't know nothing else but that I don't know nothing else but that that's right Jesus and him crucified glory and I'm dead to all the things of the world oh some God Marnie I'll Fly Away I mean it believes You're Gonna Fly Away one of these days to a home on God Celestial sword we but if Troy I think I think he's feeling it too if this world is getting just too bad to even living anymore amen it's time to leave this world I remember brother John Steam and brother remember they all remember way back what was that I was 20 that was 40 years ago something 40 years ago brother John would always preach boy I'll tell you what it can't go much every service he preached you can talk about the end of time it can't go much longer can't go much longer and I thought what would he think about all of this now look at where we're at how late it really is truly it's getting close folks truly it's getting close and that means it's time to do what Jesus said be ready for you know not the hour nor the day how many beliefs we need to be ready we need to be victorious we need to live Victorious lives every day I don't know about you but I want to be the kind of Christian that as these battles come up hello as these battles come up by the power of the Holy Ghost to overcome them preaching Wednesday I went home and thought about what I had said and so forth and I realized that my battle in my thoughts that I had that week that I actually the actual thing that helped me to overcome was love was love how many believe that love is one of the greatest weapons there is to overcoming foreign not going to make a long service because I was going to go to Ephesians where's the armor you know having done all the stands stand therefore having on the Blessed paid of righteousness the helmet of salvation and all these other things praying and always Jesus but I mean Paul said always praying in the Holy Ghost I believe that's real powerful Christian to always be praised but you know I thought about faith you know how that Faith you know uh will quench all the fiery Darks of the week There's great things that faith will do but Paul said in First Corinthians 13 though I have faith so that I can move mountains huh because faith I tell you what how many knows that David had faith those in the Old Testament even though they weren't born again they have faith and God honored their faith God will honor Faith No Matter What huh but that doesn't seal you into the kingdom Paul says you got to have something more than that and something what's more powerful than faith is love amen oh man I thought you know there's nothing that real genuine love won't overcome and I mean look the devil will do anything to bring hatred variance strife over in Galatians says let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory the devil wants to bring Strife he wants to bring division he wants to bring immune emulation and all these other things even variance may I don't know for sure what variance means but I would think that it would be something that would vary something would be different maybe I'm wrong but we're not supposed to be very we're supposed to be one in mind heart and soul how many believe that amen it's one thing that overcomes hate it overcomes and it overcomes just about anything how many believe that can we read that yet maybe I've skipped some of the other stuff I want to bring this down Paul said though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass and the tinkling symbol and do I have to give the prophecy and understand all Mysteries hello and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I can remove mountains and I have not charity I am nothing folks wouldn't it be nice if we had speaking in tongues and churches somebody else over here interpreted and say brother now brother Woody don't you go under the scaffold tomorrow because that Plank's gonna break and it's going to break your neck so don't go under that scaffold don't go on to that two stuff High whatever it is that bike's gonna fall tomorrow morning he'd go down there and he'd come and he'd remember what it was and he'd back up there goes that block he said praise be to God now that's God huh to have all prophecy and have tongues and this that or the other I'd like to have that sure but brother Brown says you know if you had your church and or if you could have gifts or whatever you'd what would you want them to have he said I would want them to have love the love of Jesus Christ amen because all these other things are perishing their people get jealous and uh people think of themselves as something huh get puffed up knowledge puffs up the Corinthians search they were always sad each other and thinking of who's going to be the greatest let me tell you something even around this message I'm afraid it's going too much around the world who's the greatest this out of the other God's not in that stuff as soon as somebody tries to be the greatest you remember God ain't there that's not God great fancy things were all equal better Bantam there's here to me brother Benham was higher than anybody by fire and he always says if you love me just call me my dear brother he didn't make himself big he could have but he didn't real big man make himself small amen but love how many believes in love is the most powerful thing amen that the church could have it's the greatest weapon that you'll overcome if you want to overcome have the love of God in your heart there's just about nothing that you can't overcome you will have long patience with one another you belong suffering you'll be kind you'll be meek amen charity suffereth long it's kind charity envious not it doesn't want what somebody else has or be like somebody else it bondeth not itself it's not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly and it seeks not her own how many believes if you've got the Holy Ghost you are not a hermit it's not about you it's living for somebody else [Music] brother Tommy that's one of the notable things I hear you say is you know what I got I just want you to ask I want you all to know that you don't have to be bound to Bonded you don't have it God delivers God sets free amen and I'll tell you what that led that strike to the right person at the right time the right place they'll come forth it'll do something amen it's just kind of like preaching the word of God this morning you know if the right person at the right place at the right time that word hits and they'll receive and say I want that that's me hey man but you got the one you got to say that for me this morning that's what I want I want that make me brother brother I'm a complete Victory not just a little oh my I'll tell you what in the old time whenever they killed somebody even Saul said I believe it was amen they would chop their head off and put it on the stake and I was there traveling that emulation is starting right and all those things in the flesh doesn't be your trophy and sticking out of power I'm Victorious over nothing leave me like David and grabbed that old Goliath probably had to have two hands and pulling up the scooter scrawny little fella that he was but he says Glory they're nervous and everything else when you can't overcome that praise be to God stick it on the poles hey I'm Victorious lukewarmness mediocracy getting too comfortable amen praise the Lord America they got too comfortable didn't he look at him oh my you love him this morning praise the Lord they weren't privileged back then no matter how many victories they had they couldn't change their nature remember Peter said that we have the promises of God has been given to us according to his divine nature how many believes that's what we want that's where the victory lays in in Christ divine nature divine nature is that godliness that patience it's that Temperance it's that knowledge it's their faith they said Mercury it said brother the kindness it just barely leaves anything out does it huh look at that it starts with faith it goes to Virtue it goes to knowledge goes to Temperance it goes patience it goes godliness it goes and you know you think that's to be a little deeper than just brotherly kindness at the top no it was just simple how about being a little kind how many believe we could be a little bit perhaps some more Brothers behind this is one of the most essential things up right up close to the Holy Spirit and they're right beside perfect love right at the very top the Capstone of it all all of these things of course are what the essence of God I mean at least the essence of God it's what that is and when you have those things and they say in you he said Peter said You shall never oh amen you love him this morning amen musicians if you will come stand with me this evening come I guess it's afternoon laughs no wonder
