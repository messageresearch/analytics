[28:18] mixed up sometime my math is wrong. I I
[28:21] want to read this to you tonight and
[28:23] this is what we mean to one another.
[28:26] This for is from a long time ago and I
[28:29] found this in my song book tonight and I
[28:32] asked brother Thomas if I could read it
[28:33] and he said yes. Says, "Please remember
[28:36] us in prayer
[28:38] for traveling Friday as we are going to
[28:42] Louisville
[28:44] to a bone cancer specialist. He will
[28:46] look at the disc and probably just talk
[28:49] to us what what to us the probably will
[28:54] have to go back next week for a biopsy
[28:57] to to determine if I have cancer or not.
[29:01] She says, "I had a sister in our church
[29:03] tell me one day this week say this week
[29:06] said,"Lord,
[29:08] you healed brother Brandham's wife
[29:11] when she had the tumor on her side."
[29:14] Brother Brandham said before the doctors
[29:17] touch her she will be healed. And the
[29:20] sister said Lord if you could do that
[29:22] for brother Brandham's wife you can do
[29:24] that for sister Anne. Now a lot of you
[29:28] young people may not know sister an
[29:32] sister Hannah wrote this to her.
[29:34] How many years ago has that been sister
[29:36] Hannah? Maybe 10. At least 10. I found
[29:40] this today and I told brother Thomas
[29:43] that's what we do. Do we encourage one
[29:44] another? We're in a battle cuz we're in
[29:47] a battle tonight.

[30:05] direction. But we're in a battle and I

[43:55] I've seen some valleys. I've walked
[43:58] through darkness.
[44:01] waited through rivers of grief.
[44:07] Oh, the enemy told me that I was

[44:31] The hands of the Savior kept holding me
[44:35] up. His promise of help is my soul.
[44:44] If God is for me,
[44:49] who could stand against me?
[44:54] No weapon shall prosper

[45:41] never make it and you can win this fight
[45:46] alone.

[45:53] doubt? Just remember what he's always
[45:57] done.
[45:59] Say he's never failed me and he never
[46:04] will. And the battles already won.
[46:11] If God is for me,
[46:15] who could stand against me?
[46:20] No weapon shall prosper.
[46:24] When God's on my side,
[46:29] it's just me and Jesus.
[46:34] I can't be defeated
[46:38] when my God is with me. I've got the
[46:42] victory
[46:44] every time.
[46:48] And if God is for me,
[46:52] who could stand against me?
[46:56] No weapon shall prosper
[47:01] when God's on my side.
[47:05] If it's just me and Jesus,
[47:10] I can't be defeated.
[47:14] When my God is with me, I've got the
[47:19] victory
[47:20] every time.
[47:24] When my God is with me, I've got the
[47:28] victory every time.
[47:33] When my God is with me, I've got the
[47:37] victory every time.

[54:21] that little chorus as Brother Joe comes.
[54:23] Shut in with God in a secret place. Is
[54:26] that your desire tonight?
[54:29] Oh, shut in
[54:32] with God
[54:35] in a secret
[54:39] place.
[54:41] There
[54:43] in the spirit
[54:46] beholding
[54:48] his face,
[54:52] gaining
[54:54] new power
[54:57] to run in the race.
[55:02] I long
[55:04] to be shut in with God.
[55:12] Amen. Is that your desire this evening
[55:14] to be shut in with him?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer.
[55:18] Father, Lord, we just thank you for the
[55:20] opportunity you give us to worship you,
[55:22] Lord, to love you, Father, and to be
[55:24] loved by you. Thank you for your grace,
[55:27] Lord, you've extended to us. Thank you
[55:30] for the message you brought our way,
[55:31] Lord. You turned us from unbelief to
[55:34] believing, Lord. You turn us from sin,
[55:37] Lord, and being repbates to being sons
[55:39] and daughters of God. What a great
[55:41] privilege we have to, Lord, to know who
[55:44] we are in this hour, in this age, Lord,
[55:46] and knowing that shortly, Lord, these
[55:49] robes of humanity are going to fall
[55:51] aside, Lord, and we're going to take on
[55:52] new bodies, Lord. A body like your own
[55:55] glorious body transformed
[55:58] in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye,
[56:00] Lord. Father, what a great day that's
[56:02] going to be. So Lord, we just commit our
[56:05] lives to you aresh tonight. Lord, as
[56:07] this is a young people's service, I
[56:09] believe we're all young at heart.
[56:12] No matter, Lord, what our ages are,
[56:15] Lord, believe we all can take away
[56:17] something from the word tonight. But
[56:19] Lord, we just want to just speak a few
[56:22] minutes to the youth here that's in this
[56:24] hour, in this day and age, Lord, knowing
[56:26] that they fight many difficulties and
[56:28] they face many battles that we didn't
[56:30] face, Lord, at their age. And we just
[56:32] pray Lord you give him strength, courage
[56:34] and guidance. Father, now may you bless
[56:36] the word as it comes forth. Lord, I ask
[56:39] you open my mouth to the things of God
[56:41] and shut it to the the things of
[56:43] humanity. Lord, may only those things
[56:45] that will bless your people come forth.
[56:47] Father, we love you and we just commit
[56:48] this service to you in Jesus name. And
[56:52] if you have your Bibles tonight, we're
[56:53] going to look here in the book of
[56:54] Daniel.
[56:57] Just want to appreciate brother Thomas.
[56:59] Yeah. Thank you to uh
[57:03] I didn't reach him ahead of time just to
[57:05] kind of ask him if he was okay with me
[57:08] directing this evening service to the
[57:09] young people. So I just appreciate the
[57:12] liberty we have to be able to to do that
[57:15] this this evening rather. Young people,
[57:17] I want to speak to you on courage to
[57:19] stand strong in a sinful age. Courage to
[57:23] stand strong in a sinful age. Now, many
[57:26] of you are going to be going back to
[57:27] school here within the next week, two
[57:29] weeks, 3 weeks. Uh many of us are going
[57:32] back to jobs situations. Uh there's a
[57:35] youth camp next week. But I just want
[57:37] something that will anchor you tonight
[57:39] to know that God has equipped us with
[57:42] courage and he's equipped us to be able
[57:44] to stand in this evil hour. We look here
[57:46] in the book of Daniel
[57:49] uh chapter 6 and verse one. and said,
[57:51] "It pleased Darius to set over the
[57:54] kingdom 120 princes, which should be
[57:57] over the whole kingdom, and over these
[58:00] three presidents, of whom Daniel was
[58:02] first, that the princes might give an
[58:04] account unto them, and the king should
[58:06] have no damage." Then this Daniel was
[58:09] preferred above the presidents and
[58:10] princes. Notice why. Because he had an
[58:14] excellent spirit was in him. and the
[58:17] king thought to set him over the whole
[58:20] realm. Then the presidents and princes
[58:23] sought to find occasion against Daniel
[58:24] concerning the kingdom, but they could
[58:26] find no occasion nor fault, for so much
[58:28] as he was faithful, neither was any
[58:31] error or fault found in him. Then said
[58:34] these men, "We shall not find any
[58:37] occasion against Daniel, except we find
[58:38] it against him concerning the law of his
[58:41] God."
[58:42] Then these presidents and princes
[58:44] assembled together to the king, and they
[58:46] said, "Thus unto him, King Darius live
[58:48] forever, and all the presidents of the
[58:50] kingdom, governors, princes, counselors,
[58:52] and captains, have consulted together to
[58:55] establish a royal statute,
[58:58] and to make a firm decree that whosoever
[59:00] shall ask petition," that word there is
[59:02] prayer or request, of any god or man,
[59:05] for 30 days, save thee, O king, he shall
[59:08] be cast into the den of lions. Now, oh
[59:11] king, established a decree and sign the
[59:13] writing that it may be that it may not
[59:14] be changed according to the law of the
[59:16] Mes and Persians which alter it not.
[59:18] Wherefore the king Darius signed it the
[59:21] writing and a decree. Now when Daniel
[59:24] knew that the writing was signed, he
[59:26] went into his house and his windows
[59:28] being open in his chamber toward
[59:30] Jerusalem. He kneled upon his knees
[59:32] three times a day and he prayed and he
[59:34] gave thanks before his God as he did a
[59:37] four time. God bless you. You can have
[59:39] your seats this evening.
[59:48] Good to see all these young people up
[59:50] front. Young and young
[59:54] and some of the young young ones are
[59:56] going.
[59:58] All right. Well, let's just get into I
[1:00:00] go to my timer. Let me set my timer so I
[1:00:02] don't overextend myself tonight.
[1:00:08] There we go. Amen. So, we just kind of
[1:00:10] want to take this thought of courage to
[1:00:14] stand strong in a sinful age. And we
[1:00:17] look at the word courage here. And I'm
[1:00:19] just going to take my time this this
[1:00:21] evening rather. Courage is the ability
[1:00:23] to do something that frightens one is uh
[1:00:27] is to have strength in fa in the face of
[1:00:29] pain and grief. Now, we think about
[1:00:31] courage sometimes if we're not mistaken.
[1:00:33] We we kind of mix up bravery and
[1:00:35] courage. But there's a huge difference
[1:00:37] between being brave and being
[1:00:39] courageous. See, and it all lies in the
[1:00:42] attitude in which we approach a
[1:00:44] challenge or a task. Being brave is
[1:00:46] often an impulse decision. While
[1:00:48] unlocking courage involves intentional
[1:00:51] planning and action, you know, somebody
[1:00:54] threatens your wife, you can be brave.
[1:00:55] It's an instant. It's, you know,
[1:00:57] something happens. But to have courage
[1:00:59] means you see the long range plan and
[1:01:01] you go toward it anyway. So bravery is
[1:01:04] often seen as taking on a challenge head
[1:01:06] on without fear. But it also involves
[1:01:08] recognizing potential opportunities and
[1:01:11] having the courage to pursue them
[1:01:12] despite of any obstacles that may arise.
[1:01:15] On the other hand, courage goes beyond
[1:01:17] just taking risks. It's about having the
[1:01:20] conscious strength to face a corporate
[1:01:22] fear and act in despite of them.
[1:01:27] All right? It means standing up for what
[1:01:28] you believe in when there are
[1:01:30] consequences at stake. So Daniel knew
[1:01:35] that there was a law passed.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Daniel knew
[1:01:41] that if he was to ask God or he was to
[1:01:43] pray, then there was going to be
[1:01:44] consequences. And he knew what those
[1:01:46] consequences were. Daniel wasn't brave.
[1:01:50] He was a man of courage. That's right.
[1:01:52] Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; So, it's doing the right thing in a
[1:01:56] sinful hour, in a sinful age. See,
[1:02:00] ultimately showcasing bravery and
[1:02:02] courage are both taking bold action. But
[1:02:04] being being brave happens in a quick hit
[1:02:08] moment, impulse, while being courageous
[1:02:10] is a long game plan.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; All right? Where a moment of bravery is
[1:02:16] usually a response to one's in-moment
[1:02:18] intuition. Being courageous is
[1:02:20] processing hurdles that are out on the
[1:02:22] horizon and intentionally
[1:02:25] leaping anyway. It's easy to give up and
[1:02:28] to quit when things are tough, but it
[1:02:30] takes true courage to continue on in
[1:02:33] despite of fear, despite of the odds. So
[1:02:37] courage starts with knowledge, but also
[1:02:39] requires faith and action.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Picasso. How many of you familiar with
[1:02:45] Picasso?
[1:02:47] Okay. Handful. Picasso once shared this.
[1:02:50] He said, "What one does is what counts,
[1:02:56] not what one intentions of doing."
[1:02:59] All right, young people, listen to me.
[1:03:01] What one does is what counts, not what
[1:03:04] one has intentions of doing. There's a
[1:03:07] famous quote, and we all quote it, and
[1:03:08] we've probably heard it quoted many
[1:03:10] times, that the road to hell is paved
[1:03:12] with good intentions.
[1:03:16] So I looked that up. I'm like, where did
[1:03:18] that originate? And it originated way
[1:03:20] back in the 1100s by a man by the name
[1:03:23] of St. Bernard of Chevro. And he wrote
[1:03:26] that hell is full of good wishes and
[1:03:28] desires. And the phrase emphasizes that
[1:03:31] good intentions are not enough. Actions
[1:03:34] and their consequences are what truly
[1:03:37] matter. So young people, I intended to
[1:03:40] get up early and read my Bible. I
[1:03:42] intended to come to church on Wednesday
[1:03:44] night. I had great intentions,
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; but great intentions are not getting the
[1:03:51] job done.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; I have I have intentions of serving the
[1:03:56] Lord, but I'm pulled by everything else.
[1:03:59] Notice the road to hell, and I'm not
[1:04:01] trying to scare you tonight, but the
[1:04:03] road to hell is paved
[1:04:06] with good intentions. There's going to
[1:04:09] be a lot of people in hell, a lot of
[1:04:11] young people in hell that had good
[1:04:13] intentions.
[1:04:14] They didn't want to live their life.
[1:04:16] They intended at the rightful age or
[1:04:18] whatever they were going to give their
[1:04:19] heart to the Lord and you know they were
[1:04:21] going to do the things necessary but God
[1:04:23] took them and required them ahead of
[1:04:26] time. So we can look at it Picasso I
[1:04:29] love how he said it. What one does is
[1:04:32] what counts. Young people it's what you
[1:04:33] do that counts not what you intend to
[1:04:36] do. So courage is not intending to do,
[1:04:39] but courage is doing the right thing in
[1:04:41] the face of opposition.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; And today I'm going to go on notice and
[1:04:46] say that courage is in short supply.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Many are afraid to stand out and oppose
[1:04:52] the masses. We live in a woke
[1:04:55] generation. Now y'all familiar with woke
[1:04:57] generation and DIIE and DEI and all that
[1:05:01] here in Kentucky. We live in a woke
[1:05:03] generation. People are more focused on
[1:05:06] DEI and that's diversity, equality, and
[1:05:09] inclusion than DIIE, dying out to self.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; They're so, oh, I don't want to offend
[1:05:16] nobody.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Well, you don't want to offend nobody,
[1:05:22] but the whole time you're offending God.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want to offend nobody. I
[1:05:30] don't want nobody to offend me. It ain't
[1:05:32] about us. It's about God. It's about his
[1:05:35] word. People are more focused on who
[1:05:38] they offend or if they're going to be
[1:05:40] offended versus standing on the
[1:05:42] principles and values of the word.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; People are concerned about who or what
[1:05:49] they identify with.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Well, I identify with a dog.
[1:05:56] I identify with a cat. I identify with
[1:05:59] pronouns. Him and they and she. And what
[1:06:02] happened to her and him?
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Now we got they and them.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; I mean, you either one or the other. God
[1:06:10] made you male and female. He didn't make
[1:06:12] you both.
[1:06:13] But in this generation, it's become the
[1:06:16] norm to where you can't speak against
[1:06:18] it. Are you going to receive backlash?
[1:06:21] And what has happened is our society has
[1:06:24] lost the courage and Christians have
[1:06:26] lost the courage to stand for the true
[1:06:29] principles of the word and call it black
[1:06:32] and white and call sin sin. And now we
[1:06:34] back down and you know we're afraid to
[1:06:36] preach it behind the pulpit because now
[1:06:39] that's going to be what they call um uh
[1:06:42] hate crime. You can't preach against
[1:06:44] these things in fear of being arrested.
[1:06:48] Let me tell you that goes way back when
[1:06:50] my great great great great granddaddy
[1:06:52] Paul, he was arrested. He was thrown in
[1:06:54] prison. Oh, but one night when he began
[1:06:56] to worship and begin to praise God,
[1:06:58] notice what happened. The prison cells
[1:07:00] fell open and Paul walked out of there.
[1:07:03] Let me tell you, praise today still
[1:07:06] breaks prison walls. God is still a God
[1:07:09] of the impossible. He's looking for men
[1:07:11] of courage. He's looking for women of
[1:07:13] courage that to stand in the face of
[1:07:15] opposition
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; and stand for the principles of the
[1:07:19] Bible and not back down, not give up,
[1:07:22] not give in, but to stand there and be a
[1:07:25] man and woman of courage.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; And it takes courage to go against the
[1:07:31] flow. It takes courage to stand for
[1:07:34] godliness. It takes a godly courage to
[1:07:36] stand in Satan's Eden
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; in our present society. Everything is
[1:07:42] against a Christian. It's against your
[1:07:45] morals, against your ethics, against
[1:07:46] your integrity. They despise us for our
[1:07:50] standard.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; See, and that standard brings a
[1:07:56] conviction, a holy conviction upon them.
[1:07:58] They despise us for our holiness. They
[1:08:01] despise you for your honesty. They
[1:08:04] sisters, they despise you for your
[1:08:05] modesty. They despise you for your long
[1:08:07] hair. They despise you because you don't
[1:08:09] wear makeup. You don't look like a
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; I know that's blunt, but I'm just
[1:08:14] telling you, they despise you because
[1:08:16] you don't look like them.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; You ain't got your skirts all hiked up.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; You ain't got your tops so tight. They
[1:08:24] despise you for your godliness.
[1:08:27] It brings a conviction upon them. My
[1:08:30] wife told me when she was in college,
[1:08:32] she was telling this girl about how why
[1:08:34] we must wear long hair. And her
[1:08:36] response, I wish you would have never
[1:08:38] told me that. Now I'm going to be
[1:08:40] accountable for that
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; courage.
[1:08:48] The Bible tells us in 2 Timothy 3 and
[1:08:51] verse one this know also then the last
[1:08:53] days perilous time shall come. We're
[1:08:55] here.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Men shall be lovers of their own selves,
[1:09:01] covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[1:09:03] disobedient to parents, unthankful,
[1:09:05] unholy, without natural affection,
[1:09:10] truth breakers, false accusers,
[1:09:11] incontinent, fierce, despisers of those
[1:09:14] that are good.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; We read this whole list, but I want you
[1:09:19] to focus on this. Despisers of those
[1:09:22] that are good.
[1:09:26] I don't know if you keep up with
[1:09:27] politics and I'm not asking you to give
[1:09:29] me a a resume of it, but if you have any
[1:09:32] kind of insight to news media and you
[1:09:35] think about some of these media outlets,
[1:09:38] CNN being one of them, everything is
[1:09:41] against the conservative.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; We're not even talking a Christian.
[1:09:46] We're talking it's against the
[1:09:47] conservative values of our country, much
[1:09:50] less the Christian values that we
[1:09:52] possess. And we find they they're
[1:09:55] despisers of those that are good. And
[1:09:57] the Bible goes on to say they're
[1:09:58] traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of
[1:10:01] pleasure, more than lovers of God,
[1:10:04] having a form of godliness, but deny the
[1:10:07] power.
[1:10:09] So this phrase here, I want to kind of
[1:10:11] go into it. Young people, despisers of
[1:10:13] those that are good. It means hostile to
[1:10:16] virtue,
[1:10:18] opposed to goodness and good men, not
[1:10:21] lovers of good men. They hate them.
[1:10:25] Those who do not love the good must
[1:10:27] radically be bad themselves.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; In our society, in the world that we
[1:10:33] live in is against you.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't feel that it's against
[1:10:42] you. Satan is against you. and he comes
[1:10:45] into the educational system and that's
[1:10:47] where he begins to propagate his lies
[1:10:50] and push these things through and to you
[1:10:52] know because he knows you need an
[1:10:54] education. And so we find that courage,
[1:10:57] it takes courage to continue to stand
[1:11:02] when you're the only one in high school.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; It takes courage to stand when you're
[1:11:10] the only one on the job.
[1:11:15] I'm talking about standing for the
[1:11:16] principles of the word.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not just talking about we're
[1:11:20] going to get into compromising later,
[1:11:22] but we're not talking about that. I'm
[1:11:23] talking about standing when all the boys
[1:11:26] are doing their thing, telling their
[1:11:28] jokes and talking about this and what
[1:11:30] they did. It takes courage to say, "I
[1:11:33] refuse to be a part of that." And turn
[1:11:34] and walk away.
[1:11:37] It takes courage for you young sisters
[1:11:39] to not trim those dead ends because all
[1:11:41] the other girls in school are snippy
[1:11:43] snippy trimming trimming. It takes
[1:11:46] courage to not put the the the the rouge
[1:11:48] on and the makeup on and eyelash on and
[1:11:51] all that to hide little imperfections.
[1:11:54] It takes courage to say, "God, you made
[1:11:56] me this way. I'm going to walk forth in
[1:11:58] this manner and I know you're going to
[1:12:00] protect me and take care of me and have
[1:12:02] a godly courage about you to stand in
[1:12:05] the face of opposition. And we
[1:12:08] understand young people, we too have
[1:12:10] been young once.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you, I've had a
[1:12:14] pimple or two.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the end of the world for me
[1:12:18] and it ain't going to be the end of the
[1:12:19] world for you.
[1:12:21] But don't compromise your values.
[1:12:26] have courage to stand there. Let them
[1:12:29] see that God has a young lady in this
[1:12:31] hour who refuses to give up on the
[1:12:33] values of God, who refuses to cut her
[1:12:36] hair according to the word of God. Young
[1:12:38] men that refuse their integrity to
[1:12:41] compromise their ethics just to fit in
[1:12:43] with some group or to fit in with some
[1:12:45] click. This ain't about clicking with
[1:12:47] the world. It's about clicking with God.
[1:12:50] having a godly courage in this hour to
[1:12:53] stand for the things of God.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And God has given you a message to stand
[1:12:59] with.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; It's a despisers of those that are good.
[1:13:06] Notice what we find in 1 Corinthians 16
[1:13:10] and verse 13 says, "Watch ye stand fast
[1:13:13] in the faith. Quit you like men. be
[1:13:18] strong. Now, that's King James.
[1:13:22] You like, man, you going to have to
[1:13:23] break that down in some Kentucky
[1:13:25] language.
[1:13:27] So, let me just put it in Kentucky
[1:13:29] vernacular.
[1:13:31] Is that all right? Can I do that?
[1:13:34] What's
[1:13:37] I'll tell you that later.
[1:13:40] What's veracular? Language.
[1:13:44] Kentucky language. All right. So what
[1:13:48] watch otherwise be alert
[1:13:52] stand fast. Now this phrase here stand
[1:13:57] fast means to be firm holding and
[1:14:00] defending the truths of the gospel
[1:14:03] to stand resolute.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not backing up, not giving
[1:14:10] in, not cowering down, but standing firm
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; in your convictions. Standing firm in
[1:14:17] what you believe. Standing firm on the
[1:14:20] basis of the Bible. It's standing firm.
[1:14:26] When nobody will stand with you, you
[1:14:28] stand anyway. When everybody's walked
[1:14:30] away from you, you stand anyway.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about being courageous, not
[1:14:36] a coward.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. And God is looking for
[1:14:39] those with courage that'll stand in the
[1:14:41] evil day, that'll stand in the last day,
[1:14:44] that know their names are on the lamb's
[1:14:45] book of life. He's looking for a young
[1:14:47] person, a young boy, a young girl that
[1:14:49] says, "I refuse to give up. I refuse to
[1:14:52] give in. I'm going to stand here in this
[1:14:54] test.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Stand fast
[1:15:01] in the faith.
[1:15:04] Quit you like men.
[1:15:08] Otherwise, be a man.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Be a man.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; We got enough wishywashy panty waist men
[1:15:19] out there today. He's wanting to find a
[1:15:22] man,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; not some tightlegged, oh, how many Yeah,
[1:15:27] I better be stopped. Woo!
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; No, he's looking for men.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Man, that's manly. That's golly. Quit
[1:15:37] ye. Be a man about it. You know, we'd
[1:15:39] say in in Louisiana, be a man. Man up.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; I like to add a little bit extra to it.
[1:15:45] Man up. Weak sauce.
[1:15:48] When you become a man, I'll give you a
[1:15:50] man card back.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Now you a man. Just cuz you drive a big
[1:15:54] truck don't make you a man.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; It's because you good-look don't make
[1:15:59] you a man.
[1:16:01] It's cuz you 200 lb and you may be
[1:16:03] bowled up, bulletproof, but you ain't a
[1:16:05] man yet. A real man stands on the
[1:16:09] virtues and the values of the word. He
[1:16:12] don't compromise by family. He don't
[1:16:15] compromise for friendships. He don't
[1:16:17] compromise by job. He don't make any
[1:16:19] compromisation. He stands resolute on
[1:16:22] the promises of God.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And God is looking for men and women of
[1:16:26] courage.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When you're rejected,
[1:16:30] stand fast. When you're despised, stand
[1:16:33] fast. Some of y'all been despised.
[1:16:36] But you're standing
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; standing alone. Or what they think
[1:16:41] you're standing alone, but you're not
[1:16:43] alone.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; You're not alone.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Huh? You're at home.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; You keep standing.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Stand on the values of this message.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Notice when you're facing peer pressure,
[1:16:55] young people. Now, I know ain't none of
[1:16:57] y'all have ever faced peer peer
[1:16:59] pressure, have you? What is that?
[1:17:04] What's that vernacular word again? Peer
[1:17:07] pressure. You know, your friends like,
[1:17:08] "Oh, come on. Everybody's doing it."
[1:17:12] Y'all ain't never heard that, Daniel.
[1:17:14] Come on, Daniel. Don't be playing games
[1:17:17] with me.
[1:17:19] Peer pressure.
[1:17:21] Lyric.
[1:17:24] Peer pressure. You ain't never faced
[1:17:25] that, have you?
[1:17:27] Giddy in giddy. Get giddy. Get giddy.
[1:17:32] Peer pressure. Now, I know you look at
[1:17:35] us old people and y'all think, man, they
[1:17:37] don't know what I'm going through. They
[1:17:39] don't know about this peer pressure.
[1:17:41] They don't know what I'm going through
[1:17:42] in school and the pressure. We all have
[1:17:45] been there. You know what peer pressure
[1:17:47] is? I know you know what it is. It's
[1:17:49] pressure from your peers.
[1:17:52] Lyric. The guys at school want you to do
[1:17:54] something. I want you to be cool. Fit
[1:17:56] in. Take a drag. Take a hit. Come on.
[1:18:00] Everybody's doing it. Come on. Lyric.
[1:18:02] Don't be such a bad note. Huh? You get
[1:18:04] that lyric? Bad note.
[1:18:08] You'll get that tomorrow. Maybe.
[1:18:12] Don't be such a sour note. There you go.
[1:18:13] There. We can put that one out there.
[1:18:16] And then part of you wants to do it.
[1:18:20] Part of you is tempted
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; to do it.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; And young ladies, part of you have been
[1:18:26] tempted. Oh, come on. It's just a little
[1:18:30] white head.
[1:18:32] I mean, ain't nobody going to know it.
[1:18:34] The way you kick it on there, it will
[1:18:36] be.
[1:18:38] But it's peer pressure. I'm being
[1:18:41] pressured. me. They tell me to do this
[1:18:43] to my hair and do this and you know if I
[1:18:45] put this kind of outfit on and it brings
[1:18:47] a little bit more revealing to my body
[1:18:49] and my curves and yeah all this kind of
[1:18:51] stuff and it's peer pressure
[1:18:56] and if you're not careful and if we're
[1:18:58] not careful we begin to yield
[1:19:02] to those pressures. Let me just tell
[1:19:05] you, it never ends.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Because we even as grown-ups, we have
[1:19:09] our own level of peer pressure.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I work in a hospital. I used to work in
[1:19:15] a hospital. There 500 employees in the
[1:19:17] hospital.
[1:19:19] There's all kind of people in the
[1:19:20] hospital. And when you make it to the
[1:19:22] top of the food chain in the hospital,
[1:19:25] everybody wants to come knocking on your
[1:19:26] door and they'll press and press all in
[1:19:29] front of you.
[1:19:31] I'm telling you young people, you got to
[1:19:33] know where you stand.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; You got You can't compromise your
[1:19:38] values. You can't compromise. Let me
[1:19:40] just say it like this. You can't
[1:19:41] compromise your marriage vows.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; To peer pressure cuz it's there.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And the opposite of courage is
[1:19:56] cowardness.
[1:19:58] Cowardness. Well, I'm just going to We
[1:20:01] We break and we give in. I just couldn't
[1:20:03] do it. I Everybody was laughing at me.
[1:20:05] They were making fun of me.
[1:20:08] It never goes away.
[1:20:15] But stand fast holding and defending the
[1:20:19] truths of the Bible.
[1:20:21] When they claim that the days of
[1:20:23] miracles is passed, that's the time to
[1:20:25] stand fast.
[1:20:28] Notice day, not school, not work within
[1:20:31] the own ranks of the message.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; They claim the days of miracles is over.
[1:20:36] The prophet's off the scene. So God
[1:20:38] doesn't do those things anymore. That's
[1:20:40] the time to stand fast and say, "The
[1:20:43] prophet may be off the scene, but the
[1:20:44] Holy Ghost is still here. God is still
[1:20:47] present. He's still moving. He still
[1:20:49] does the supernatural. We're going to
[1:20:51] stand on that word." That's young and
[1:20:54] old. We don't back down. We don't give
[1:20:56] up. We don't give in. We stand on the
[1:20:59] word of God. He's the same yesterday,
[1:21:02] today, and he'll be the same for you
[1:21:04] tomorrow.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; We claim the supernatural. We preach the
[1:21:09] supernatural.
[1:21:11] When Satan claims that the youth today
[1:21:13] cannot resist his devices,
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; what is one of the main things that
[1:21:18] Satan propagates to our young people?
[1:21:21] You got a phone on you?
[1:21:24] I ain't gonna open it. Don't worry.
[1:21:28] Whoa. Just kidding. Just kidding. I
[1:21:31] can't get in it. That right there.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; You know, used to I don't know how long
[1:21:37] ago. This is a 16.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Come, bro.
[1:21:45] It's an iPhone 20. It ain't even out
[1:21:47] yet. So there now they're we're 16 years
[1:21:50] into the iPhone or 17 roughly. So let's
[1:21:53] just go 20 years. 20 years ago you
[1:21:56] didn't have this in your pocket.
[1:22:00] So 20 years ago it was very difficult if
[1:22:04] you wanted to go look for pornography.
[1:22:05] Oh, you don't mention that word in
[1:22:07] church. It needs to be mentioned in
[1:22:09] church.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; It needs to be dealt with in the house
[1:22:11] of God. It needs to be dealt with in the
[1:22:13] hearts of men and women. Men and women.
[1:22:17] Not just men. It's not just a man thing
[1:22:19] anymore.
[1:22:20] But 20 years ago, you had a dumb phone,
[1:22:24] a flip phone, or them big phones, brick
[1:22:27] phone, stupid looking phone. I mean, you
[1:22:30] walk around with that thing, you'd be
[1:22:31] like,
[1:22:33] now we just slip it in our jacket. You
[1:22:36] know, nobody knows you got a phone. You
[1:22:38] get a few minutes, click, click, click
[1:22:40] www..com.
[1:22:43] Put it up before anybody knows it.
[1:22:50] right here. One of the greatest devices
[1:22:54] against a believer
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; because you can have access to any
[1:23:01] website you want.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; But right here, you also have access to
[1:23:09] the prophet of God, the message of the
[1:23:11] hour. You have every Bible in any
[1:23:13] language, any interpretation you want.
[1:23:15] It all lays right here. And if God can
[1:23:20] ever deal with this right here, he can
[1:23:22] take the desire for pornography out of
[1:23:24] your heart. And you won't need somebody
[1:23:27] to be a mandate on your phone. You won't
[1:23:29] have to worry about the struggle and the
[1:23:30] temptation of pornography. Why? Because
[1:23:33] God has removed it from your heart. And
[1:23:35] if I can get you in that atmosphere this
[1:23:37] evening where the Holy Spirit can come
[1:23:39] down and take the desires of the world
[1:23:41] out of your heart, take the desires of
[1:23:43] lust out of your heart, take the desires
[1:23:45] of pornography out of your heart, you
[1:23:47] won't have to worry about this phone.
[1:23:49] You won't have to worry about looking at
[1:23:50] those websites. Why? Because God has
[1:23:52] removed it from you.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Joe, what do you mean? I
[1:23:57] know what I'm talking about.
[1:23:59] I dealt with an addiction for
[1:24:00] pornography since I was 8 years old. And
[1:24:03] then finally, I turned 24 and I was
[1:24:06] praying, God, I'm about to have a baby.
[1:24:07] I want the Holy Ghost. I got to have the
[1:24:09] Holy Ghost. This this things it's got to
[1:24:11] get out of my heart. It's got to get out
[1:24:13] of my life. I don't want to be here and
[1:24:15] be a father to a daughter knowing that I
[1:24:18] got an addiction.
[1:24:21] And can I tell you this? I don't have a
[1:24:24] struggle.
[1:24:27] I don't struggle with the iPhone. I
[1:24:29] don't struggle with the iPad. I don't
[1:24:30] struggle with the MacBook. I don't
[1:24:32] struggle with Windows. I don't struggle
[1:24:34] with pornography. Why? Because the Holy
[1:24:36] Ghost
[1:24:38] because I recognized what I needed. And
[1:24:40] I was a man of courage about it. They
[1:24:42] said, "God, I need a conviction. I need
[1:24:44] the Holy Ghost in my life. I'm not
[1:24:47] looking for a prayer service. I'm not
[1:24:49] looking for my favorite preacher. I need
[1:24:51] you, God."
[1:24:53] Yeah.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; And God came down and he took those
[1:24:56] desires out. He filled me with the Holy
[1:24:59] Ghost.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't have to have restrictions.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, parents, it's
[1:25:04] your responsibility.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Just because I'm preaching this way
[1:25:09] doesn't mean, oh, willy-nilly, we can do
[1:25:10] anything we want. You better lock that
[1:25:12] sucker down like Fort Knox.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I got a son. When he got a phone,
[1:25:20] man, Mama Hitler stepped up to the
[1:25:23] scene.
[1:25:26] We locked that phone down. You would
[1:25:28] have thought we worked for the FBI, CIA,
[1:25:31] KGB, anybody else. That sucker was
[1:25:34] locked down.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, if it's in
[1:25:38] your heart, you're going to find some
[1:25:39] loophole.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; You're going to find some avenue. Oh, I
[1:25:44] got to find I got to find it. Then you
[1:25:45] start conversing with your friends. Peer
[1:25:47] pressure.
[1:25:48] You start finding ways. Oh, mama ain't
[1:25:51] so smart after all. Look at this.
[1:25:57] I'm being real with you.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Standing strong with courage in an evil
[1:26:03] day, a sinful age,
[1:26:06] till when you're tempted,
[1:26:09] you don't back down.
[1:26:11] You know, the thing is to recognize your
[1:26:13] limitations,
[1:26:15] recognize your weaknesses. I preached a
[1:26:18] message to young people a while back on
[1:26:19] recognizing your Goliath. Maybe someday
[1:26:21] I'll preach it here. Recognizing your
[1:26:24] Goliath because your Goliath may be
[1:26:25] different than mine.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Let's Gideon, your Goliath may be
[1:26:30] different than lyrics. He may struggle
[1:26:32] with things you'll never struggle with.
[1:26:34] And it be it be your Goliath. He looks
[1:26:37] at and said, "Man, I can give me a jelly
[1:26:40] bean. Got them."
[1:26:43] But for you, it's going to take a
[1:26:44] supernatural rock. And there be things
[1:26:47] lyric that you struggle with that get
[1:26:48] him be like he's supposed to be all
[1:26:50] manly. Look at him all bowed up and go
[1:26:53] to the gym and he's struggling with
[1:26:55] that. Look at him. Look at him like
[1:27:00] that's right. Look at him Gideon judging
[1:27:03] me.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; But we all struggle.
[1:27:10] But notice now,
[1:27:13] don't yield
[1:27:14] to the wokeness of this generation that
[1:27:16] we live in. Don't yield to those things.
[1:27:19] Don't yield to peer pressure. Stand
[1:27:22] fast.
[1:27:24] Stand resolute. Deuteronomy 5:32 says,
[1:27:27] "You shall observe to do therefore as
[1:27:30] the Lord your God had commanded you. You
[1:27:32] shall not turn aside to the to the right
[1:27:36] or to the left. Otherwise, we don't
[1:27:38] compromise. It's the middle of the road.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; We we look, we don't compromise our
[1:27:45] preaching.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; We don't compromise because, oh, you see
[1:27:49] it this way and you see it this way. No,
[1:27:52] we had a vindicated prophet go before
[1:27:54] us. I'm going through the middle of the
[1:27:55] road.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; We don't compromise.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Psalms 119 and verse three in the NLT
[1:28:04] translation, which is new little
[1:28:05] translation. Joyful are those who do not
[1:28:08] compromise with evil and they walk only
[1:28:12] in his paths.
[1:28:14] They do not Listen young people. This is
[1:28:16] your service. I don't know why I got a
[1:28:18] couple of you young people over here.
[1:28:20] Y'all
[1:28:22] got your hairs all braided up thinking
[1:28:24] y'all pretty and everything sitting on
[1:28:25] the back row. We ain't going to get
[1:28:27] called out. Yeah, you did.
[1:28:32] Just kidding. It's okay. Stay back here.
[1:28:36] But joyful are those who do not
[1:28:38] compromise with evil.
[1:28:41] All right? And they walk only in his
[1:28:44] paths. So let me just encourage you
[1:28:47] young people. When you go to school next
[1:28:48] week, next month, next whenever, when
[1:28:50] you go to the job, some of you that are
[1:28:52] in the workforce making your own living,
[1:28:54] thank God some of y'all get there. And
[1:28:57] all the parents said, "Hallelujah.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise God. not paying her own
[1:29:03] rent and mortgage and insurance and woo,
[1:29:06] it's great feeling. Well, notice we
[1:29:09] don't make peace packs with the devil.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Right now, Hamas is trying to make a
[1:29:16] peace treaty with Israel
[1:29:19] and Israel refuses
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; because they know the nature of Hamas.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; And we don't make peace deals with
[1:29:29] Hamas. We don't make peace deals with
[1:29:32] the enemy.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; We don't we don't negotiate for better
[1:29:36] outcomes.
[1:29:38] Well, you know how Satan likes to do it.
[1:29:40] You can go to TWT next week, but just go
[1:29:43] don't get nothing.
[1:29:45] You know, Pharaoh tried that.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; You can go only so far.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; But Moses was a man of courage. You
[1:29:54] know, it took courage. He had a stick in
[1:29:56] his hand, a donkey, a upset wife, and a
[1:29:59] child. And he went down to Egypt. And
[1:30:02] then what are you doing, Moses? I come
[1:30:03] to take over. What?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; You mean you and this? Me and this.
[1:30:10] Because me and this is a minor, a
[1:30:13] majority with God.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; And notice, he did what he claimed he
[1:30:18] was going to do because God had already
[1:30:20] spoken. told Moses, "Go down there and
[1:30:22] tell Pharaoh, "Let my people go." And
[1:30:25] Moses wasn't a coward. He didn't back
[1:30:28] down off the commission. He went down
[1:30:30] there and did exactly what God
[1:30:32] commissioned him to do. He commissioned
[1:30:34] him to exert boldness and courage in the
[1:30:37] face of opposition, in the face of a
[1:30:40] nation that was against him.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; And he went down there, him and his old
[1:30:48] highteer support. Now, I know there's no
[1:30:50] supports in here. Don't nobody look at
[1:30:52] me.
[1:30:54] You brothers better not look at me. Bro,
[1:30:57] you don't know my wife.
[1:31:01] Joe, quit looking over there at Hannah.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; You're gonna be in trouble and I'm not
[1:31:13] going to be here to help you out.
[1:31:17] But notice,
[1:31:19] it took courage.
[1:31:22] He didn't get in a Mercedes. He didn't
[1:31:24] get in a Yukon or man, somebody's out
[1:31:27] there driving a Raptor. I don't know if
[1:31:28] y'all saw that.
[1:31:31] I ain't going to tell you who it is, but
[1:31:32] he's over here.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Like, bro, I want to drive it. I've
[1:31:37] heard all about that truck for years. I
[1:31:39] just want to drive it one time. But he
[1:31:41] didn't go down there in a raptor.
[1:31:46] A donkey.
[1:31:48] Y'all know what a donkey is?
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Slowm moving
[1:31:53] just a meandering animal.
[1:31:56] He just mosies on along and just goes.
[1:31:59] But he stays the course.
[1:32:02] And he went down there and he did
[1:32:05] what they said could not be done.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; He went down there and did what they
[1:32:12] said could not be done. He exemplified
[1:32:16] courage.
[1:32:18] No doubt they like, "Moses, you're
[1:32:20] stupid. You done lost your mind." But
[1:32:23] notice, we don't negotiate
[1:32:26] for better outcomes. He didn't go down
[1:32:28] there and negotiate.
[1:32:30] Pharaoh said, "You can only go so far.
[1:32:31] You can only take the young people so
[1:32:33] far. You can only take them here." Look,
[1:32:35] we're going all the way or we ain't
[1:32:37] going at all.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, Satan has told some
[1:32:40] of you, you can only go to church. You
[1:32:42] can only do this. He don't want you to
[1:32:44] go to the rapture. He don't want you to
[1:32:45] go to the body change. Let me tell you,
[1:32:46] if I'm going to church, I'm going in the
[1:32:48] rapture. If I'm going to put the effort
[1:32:50] in, if I'm going to go to the house of
[1:32:52] God, if I'm going to make sacrifices on
[1:32:54] Wednesday, Sunday, special meet, you
[1:32:56] can't. If I'm going to put the effort
[1:32:58] in, I'm going all the way to a body
[1:33:00] change. I'm not backing up. I'm not
[1:33:03] compromising. I'm not negotiating. I'm
[1:33:06] going forward with courage and boldness
[1:33:08] and assurity that God said I'm going to
[1:33:11] be there.
[1:33:13] We're not surrender. We're not
[1:33:15] retreating. And we're not backing down.
[1:33:16] We are standing strong in the face of
[1:33:19] opposition.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; And sometimes,
[1:33:24] sometimes even us preachers
[1:33:27] have to stand by oursel.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[1:33:35] we have to stand knowing
[1:33:37] that man didn't call us.
[1:33:40] The church didn't call us, but God has
[1:33:43] called us.
[1:33:47] And we all, if I can just be a little
[1:33:50] transparent, we all, like you young
[1:33:53] people, we've had our face or we have
[1:33:56] faced our opposition,
[1:33:59] things that shook us, things that try
[1:34:01] us, things that try to shake us.
[1:34:05] To about two or three weeks ago, I had a
[1:34:06] dream.
[1:34:08] And in this dream, I'm not sure if I
[1:34:10] shared it with you or not yet. In this
[1:34:12] dream,
[1:34:14] this I didn't see the head of it, but
[1:34:15] this big snake just bumped up against
[1:34:17] me. I was laying in bed and it just
[1:34:19] slithered up and bumped me. Big snake,
[1:34:21] probably like a python. You know what a
[1:34:23] python does? It doesn't bite you. It
[1:34:24] squeezes you. If it can wrap around you,
[1:34:27] it squeeze the life. Every breath you
[1:34:29] take, it gets a tighter hold.
[1:34:32] It gets tighter. And it bumped me. I was
[1:34:35] like, "Wow, what was that?" And a few
[1:34:38] minutes later, it comes back the
[1:34:40] opposite direction and bumps me again
[1:34:42] and keeps going. You say, 'What are you
[1:34:44] bringing? What does that mean?
[1:34:47] Because last year I was bumped
[1:34:50] and this year I was bumped.
[1:34:54] No matter how many times you're bumped,
[1:34:56] you got to remain steadfast.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Satan will test you. He will try you. He
[1:35:02] will try to discourage you. Yeah.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Even amongst your peers,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; he will bump you to see where you stand.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Notice he was a coward. Wouldn't even
[1:35:14] show his face. Just bumped me in the
[1:35:16] dream. Sod up beside me.
[1:35:20] But only two times.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; So I've already come through it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; And if we come through it as ministers,
[1:35:27] you're going to come through it as young
[1:35:28] people.
[1:35:32] So, so Donna,
[1:35:36] bumped by cancer.
[1:35:39] Some of you bumped by different things,
[1:35:42] but we don't retreat.
[1:35:44] Notice what the Bible says about Daniel.
[1:35:47] Daniel did not run.
[1:35:50] He didn't run to the next county. He
[1:35:52] didn't run to the next day. He didn't
[1:35:54] run away from it. Daniel went home.
[1:35:59] Somebody help me preach right now.
[1:36:03] Daniel ran to the house of God, if we
[1:36:05] can say it like that, and he threw the
[1:36:07] curtains open, got down on his knees and
[1:36:10] begin to pray like he's always done.
[1:36:13] Daniel didn't pray more. Daniel didn't
[1:36:15] pray less. Daniel didn't compromise.
[1:36:17] Daniel just did what Daniel's always
[1:36:20] did. And what am I telling you? You as a
[1:36:22] young person, keep doing what you've
[1:36:24] always done. Keep worshiping. Keep
[1:36:27] praising. Keep giving God glory. And
[1:36:29] don't back down from the enemy. Be a man
[1:36:32] of courage.
[1:36:34] Be a daughter of courage.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to bow your head in a
[1:36:40] restaurant and give God thanks for that
[1:36:42] food.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Let this world see there's Christians in
[1:36:49] the land.
[1:36:52] That's
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; right, buddy.
[1:36:55] Be a man of conviction
[1:36:57] and not one of compromise.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Now, I've always had,
[1:37:04] believe it or not, strong convictions.
[1:37:10] Not too many people ever just got over
[1:37:12] on old Job.
[1:37:14] Because I don't mind
[1:37:16] I don't mind a little confrontation for
[1:37:18] the right thing. I don't mind standing
[1:37:21] up when nobody will stand if it's the
[1:37:25] right thing.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; I don't mind getting a black eye
[1:37:30] because at least I'm standing for
[1:37:31] something. You know there's an old
[1:37:32] country song. This is before hopefully
[1:37:34] none of y'all know this. But you got to
[1:37:36] stand for something. Are you going to
[1:37:38] what, Tommy?
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You got to stand for something.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Why not stand for something that's going
[1:37:47] to change your body? Why not stand for
[1:37:49] something that's going to heal your
[1:37:51] body? Why not stand for something that's
[1:37:52] going to give you your offspring? Why
[1:37:54] not stand for something that can keep a
[1:37:55] happy marriage? Why not stand for
[1:37:57] something that you can come into the
[1:37:59] house of God and all the pressures, all
[1:38:01] the struggles, all the difficulties of
[1:38:03] their life can just fall aside? Why not
[1:38:06] stand for this?
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:13] There was a man by the name of Daniel
[1:38:15] Curry. You probably have heard the
[1:38:16] prophet preach about Daniel Curry and he
[1:38:18] used Daniel Curry and Daniel Curry was a
[1:38:20] great man. He was a missionary and he
[1:38:21] was on the field and he died and he went
[1:38:23] to heaven and there Peter was at the
[1:38:25] gate. I don't know why they got Peter at
[1:38:27] the gate. He was a fisherman. He wasn't
[1:38:28] a gate collector but whatever. That's
[1:38:30] their story. Let them tell it how they
[1:38:31] want to. But he gets there and Peter's
[1:38:33] like, "What's your name?" Daniel Curry.
[1:38:35] I was a missionary. I went here, here,
[1:38:37] here. And he looked and he says, "I
[1:38:38] don't see your name."
[1:38:41] But but but but but but but
[1:38:45] I don't see your name. But I was a
[1:38:46] mission. I listen Daniel. I don't know
[1:38:48] if you know English, Japanese, Chinese,
[1:38:51] dirty knees. It don't really matter to
[1:38:53] me. I don't see your name.
[1:38:59] If he says you got one thing you can do,
[1:39:02] you can appeal your case.
[1:39:06] You can appeal your case
[1:39:09] to him.
[1:39:11] And so Daniel Curry appealed his case
[1:39:14] and he goes before brother Thomas. I
[1:39:16] love how brother Brandham begins to
[1:39:18] dramatize it. Daniel Curry, have you
[1:39:20] ever told a lie?
[1:39:25] What about it, boys?
[1:39:30] Daniel,
[1:39:33] what about it? Gersham,
[1:39:35] Paul, Lyric, girls never told a lie. He
[1:39:41] says in that presence, he thought, man,
[1:39:44] I've never told a lie, but in that
[1:39:45] presence, everything was exposed.
[1:39:48] Yes. Yes. When I was on earth, I told a
[1:39:52] lie. Daniel Curry, have you ever stolen
[1:39:55] anything?
[1:39:57] He's like, nah, never. Never. But in
[1:39:59] that presence he realized maybe he have
[1:40:03] robbed time from the employer.
[1:40:05] Maybe he have taken this and didn't know
[1:40:08] that it was truly stealing.
[1:40:11] And he says,
[1:40:13] "Daniel Curry, have you ever done this?"
[1:40:16] And he's in that presence everything was
[1:40:18] exposed. He knew no matter how much he
[1:40:21] preached, how much missionary work he
[1:40:23] did, he knew in that presence, he was
[1:40:26] not fit.
[1:40:29] But at that time, here comes the
[1:40:31] sweetest voice he had ever heard. He
[1:40:33] said it was sweeter than any mother's
[1:40:35] voice, brother Thomas. It was the voice
[1:40:37] of our Lord Jesus. And he said, "Yes,
[1:40:40] God." He said, "Daniel Curry, he made
[1:40:42] mistakes when he was down on earth, but
[1:40:44] when he was down on earth there in
[1:40:46] Elton, Kentucky, Daniel Curry stood for
[1:40:48] me. Daniel Curry stood for
[1:40:51] righteousness. Daniel Curry stood for
[1:40:53] the message. Daniel Curry stood for the
[1:40:55] things of God. And now I come. I come to
[1:40:58] stand with Daniel Curry. For Daniel
[1:41:01] Curry, he's made mistakes, but I'm
[1:41:03] standing for him. Put everything that he
[1:41:06] did on my account." I say, "Oh, glory to
[1:41:08] God this morning." Lord, thank you today
[1:41:11] that everything's on your account.
[1:41:16] And if you'll stand for God in this
[1:41:18] hour, in this generation, in this age,
[1:41:20] he will stand for you.
[1:41:23] [Applause]
[1:41:24] He will stand for you. When families
[1:41:26] left you, he'll stand for you. When your
[1:41:28] friends walked away from you and
[1:41:30] rejected you because you was a fanatic
[1:41:32] because you stood for the things of God,
[1:41:34] he will stand for you in this hour.
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:41] He will stand
[1:41:45] and having faith.
[1:41:48] Having faith, stand fast. Don't be a
[1:41:52] coward with this message.
[1:41:56] No,
[1:41:57] stand fast.
[1:42:01] Let me just kind of go a little bit
[1:42:02] further. Mercy man alive. Brother Bham
[1:42:05] faced a lot of criticism for his
[1:42:07] teachings on the trinity and godhead and
[1:42:10] healing and the prophetic gift and his
[1:42:12] claim of being of Elijah. Now leaders of
[1:42:15] the mainstream Pentecostal denominations
[1:42:17] such as Simmons of God, they were
[1:42:18] initially supportive of brother Brandham
[1:42:20] and his healing ministry. But as he be
[1:42:22] to turn the corner,
[1:42:25] as he begin to turn that corner and it
[1:42:28] was no longer the sign in the hand, it
[1:42:30] was no longer the the revealing of the
[1:42:32] secrets in the heart. When it became the
[1:42:35] preaching of the word, many of his
[1:42:38] peers,
[1:42:40] even a prophet had peers and his peers
[1:42:43] stood against him.
[1:42:46] Many many of them, notice what it says
[1:42:48] here, they grew critical of his
[1:42:50] teachings, diverged from traditional as
[1:42:52] it diverged from traditional Pentecostal
[1:42:54] theology. And in the 50s, Pentecostal
[1:42:57] leaders, they pressed Brother Bam to
[1:42:58] solely focus on his healing ministry and
[1:43:01] get away from these unique doctrines of
[1:43:04] the serpent seed
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; of being baptized in the name of the
[1:43:08] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Or in the name of the Yeah. In the name
[1:43:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ and not in the
[1:43:14] name of the Father, Son, and the Holy
[1:43:16] Ghost titles.
[1:43:18] Notice his rejection of the Trinity in
[1:43:21] favor of the witness theology. his
[1:43:23] anti-denominational rhetoric and his
[1:43:25] views on women and holiness were
[1:43:27] particularly contentious.
[1:43:30] But in the 60s, many Pentecostal
[1:43:32] churches refused to invite Brother
[1:43:34] Bradom to the pulpit.
[1:43:38] And those that did, they were
[1:43:39] sympathetic with him. They were
[1:43:41] threatened to be excommunicated
[1:43:44] from the denomination.
[1:43:46] Therefore,
[1:43:48] what it did, it isolated brother Badam.
[1:43:52] He had to stand alone. He didn't have a
[1:43:55] church like this brother Thomas that he
[1:43:57] could go to and preach. There were no
[1:43:59] message churches at that time.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; But no matter what he faced, no matter
[1:44:08] notice, he had a message to deliver.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; He had a message to the elect. It was a
[1:44:15] message of rapture in faith. And he
[1:44:17] stood bold in the face of criticism. He
[1:44:20] stood brave in the face of ridicule. He
[1:44:23] stood courageous in the face of
[1:44:25] rejection.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; He stood and if he could stand, can't we
[1:44:29] stand?
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Can't we stand among other message
[1:44:35] believers? See, we as message believers
[1:44:38] should not compromise with the message.
[1:44:40] We don't need to compromise our stand
[1:44:42] for truth no matter who and where we
[1:44:44] find ourselves. Don't compromise for the
[1:44:47] sake of friendships.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, young person.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; You know, trying to fit into a certain
[1:44:54] group. If I look a certain way, I can I
[1:44:56] can be a part of that click.
[1:44:59] Ah, don't don't compromise your virtues.
[1:45:02] Don't compromise for the sake of
[1:45:04] relationships.
[1:45:07] Well, she's so pretty.
[1:45:10] Yeah, but she ain't saved. But she's so
[1:45:13] pretty. But she ain't saved. But she's
[1:45:14] pretty. She comes to church, but she
[1:45:16] ain't saved.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham never back.
[1:45:21] He never changed his tone on the
[1:45:24] scripture that says, "Do not be
[1:45:26] unequally yolked."
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; From 47 to 65, he never backed off of
[1:45:32] it. He warned us all the way through, do
[1:45:35] not be unequally yolked. He said that
[1:45:37] marriage is one thing you can never find
[1:45:39] forgiveness for.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; You can never find forgiveness for the
[1:45:48] wrong one you marry.
[1:45:51] And sisters, he said, if you go off and
[1:45:53] marry somebody else after you've been
[1:45:55] married, you forsake your virtues and
[1:45:59] you forsake your right to the kingdom of
[1:46:01] God.
[1:46:06] you you're giving it away because I'd
[1:46:07] rather had the pleasures of the world
[1:46:10] than I would have had the virtues of
[1:46:12] God. I'm speaking to you about being
[1:46:14] courageous, standing for the truth in
[1:46:17] this hour. And it's a simple hour. It's
[1:46:20] a black hour. It's Satan's eating. But
[1:46:22] God has determined somebody's going to
[1:46:24] serve him in this hour. Don't compromise
[1:46:27] this message, parents.
[1:46:29] Now, this is to you. Don't compromise
[1:46:32] this message for the sake of being your
[1:46:34] child's friend.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I just My mama's the
[1:46:41] greatest thing since sliced bread when
[1:46:44] you better put her in a oven and toast
[1:46:45] her hide letting you get by with all
[1:46:48] that garbage and Tommy Rock.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; But I want a friend. Mama's a friend.
[1:46:52] She don't hold me
[1:46:55] She don't hold me responsible for
[1:46:56] anything. and you find that we want to
[1:46:59] be our son's buddy. We want to be our
[1:47:03] daughter's friend.
[1:47:06] Ain't nobody Look, last time I checked,
[1:47:08] I had a responsibility of being a
[1:47:10] parent.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; And that's our responsibility. You be
[1:47:13] their Holy Ghost until they get it.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; You don't lay down and you don't give up
[1:47:18] and you don't compromise your parenthood
[1:47:20] just to be a friend. That time's coming.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; All right, Lauren. She's 22.
[1:47:26] Yeah. 22.
[1:47:28] She's never gave us an ounce of problem.
[1:47:30] But Jessica has always been a mother
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; today. She's still her mother, but she's
[1:47:37] her friend.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; That time comes, but it don't come when
[1:47:41] you're 13, 14, 15, 16, trying to figure
[1:47:43] out life.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; No, you give them the structure. You
[1:47:47] give them the borders. You give them the
[1:47:49] boundaries. You give them leadership.
[1:47:52] Don't pull your hands off. I'm trying to
[1:47:53] win my son. I'm trying to win my
[1:47:55] daughter. No, you commit them to God and
[1:47:58] be a parent. That's your responsibility.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; I know that probably ain't fanf fair and
[1:48:06] favor, but it's the truth anyway.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; We don't compromise
[1:48:11] for relationships, for friendships.
[1:48:15] We stay true to the word. Let me just go
[1:48:17] on to say this, parents. Another thing,
[1:48:20] you know, there were it was a few well
[1:48:22] back when I first came into the message,
[1:48:24] it was preached said, "You know what?
[1:48:25] Your kids can listen to any kind of
[1:48:26] music they want long as they got their
[1:48:28] headphones on. Let me tell you, in Joe
[1:48:29] Adams house, I beg to differ.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; I pay the bills,
[1:48:35] Joe. I pay the mortgage. I pay the light
[1:48:38] bill, the trash bill, the water bill,
[1:48:41] and any other stinking bill that comes
[1:48:42] in that mailbox. And don't you tell me
[1:48:45] I'm going to let some snickle fris
[1:48:47] listen to what he wants just because
[1:48:48] he's my son. Ain't no good going to
[1:48:51] happen.
[1:48:53] I'll take them headphones, throw them in
[1:48:55] the trash, and pull my belt off and
[1:48:57] whoop your hide.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not backing up, church. We got a
[1:49:02] standard to uphold. We got a
[1:49:04] responsibility as sons of God, as
[1:49:07] fathers, to hold a standard in that
[1:49:09] house.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Hold the standard. Let me just take my
[1:49:14] house is a no compromise zone.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; You don't like it, you ain't got to
[1:49:20] come.
[1:49:22] Well, as long as I'm paying the bills,
[1:49:23] it's going to be my way or the highway.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; And it also goes for the sisters. You
[1:49:29] know, we we had it where they could wear
[1:49:32] their makeup. They could trim their hair
[1:49:34] cuz when they get older, they're going
[1:49:35] to grow out of it. Yeah, they did. They
[1:49:37] grew right out of church.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Some of you older ones know where I'm
[1:49:42] talking. You've been around. And you
[1:49:43] know what? Churches preach this Tommy
[1:49:45] Rock gospel and now you find some of
[1:49:47] their people ain't even serving God
[1:49:51] because we wanted friendships. God ain't
[1:49:53] called us to be a friend. He called us
[1:49:55] to be leaders. He called you to have
[1:49:57] courage and stand for this message and
[1:49:59] give your children the gospel principles
[1:50:01] and direction that they need.
[1:50:04] There will be a time to be their friend.
[1:50:06] There will be a time you can be their
[1:50:08] buddy. But now ain't that time. Now's
[1:50:11] the time to hold the message before
[1:50:13] them. Let them see we're not
[1:50:15] compromising off of this.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; We're not compromising.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Refuse to compromise with the word.
[1:50:24] Refuse to compromise with the message.
[1:50:26] You don't have to be legalistic,
[1:50:29] but you need to let them know when you
[1:50:30] walk through this door.
[1:50:33] Let me just say this. You can't keep
[1:50:34] your kids from listening to music if
[1:50:36] it's in them. They'll find the station
[1:50:38] somehow someway, but when they walk
[1:50:40] through that threshold, it won't be
[1:50:41] there.
[1:50:45] I'm not going to hold you responsible
[1:50:46] for the car. I'm not going to hold you
[1:50:48] responsible for the friends. Not going
[1:50:50] to hold you responsible for the the, you
[1:50:51] know, the out there in in the workforce
[1:50:53] and other places, but I will hold you
[1:50:54] responsible and accountable for your
[1:50:56] home.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; You're called to be leaders,
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; men of courage.
[1:51:03] Let me go on.
[1:51:05] Crit ye like men. Otherwise, be brave.
[1:51:09] Be manly.
[1:51:11] Man up weak sauce.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Y'all know what weak sauce is? It ain't
[1:51:16] got no strength behind it.
[1:51:22] Come on. Flip that wrist back, young
[1:51:24] man, and be a man about you.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; More worried about We got boys today
[1:51:29] more worried about their hair than girls
[1:51:31] are.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; I'm like, man, cut. Look at that. Woo!
[1:51:35] Cut that mess off. I look better without
[1:51:37] hair anyway.
[1:51:39] Ain't nobody laugh on that one, did
[1:51:41] they?
[1:51:44] That's a good thing, y'all. Smart
[1:51:46] peoples.
[1:51:49] But be a man.
[1:51:52] You know, let's look at this. What makes
[1:51:54] a man today as we start wrapping this
[1:51:56] up? When you look at man today in our
[1:51:58] society, men are judged by their
[1:52:00] physique.
[1:52:04] Like Tommy walking around here all bowed
[1:52:06] up.
[1:52:08] Tommy and his buddy behind him, man.
[1:52:09] They both jacked up.
[1:52:13] The three of us walk in. That is triple
[1:52:15] trouble cuz we all about 5 foot nothing,
[1:52:20] bowed up.
[1:52:24] Your friend ain't going to never come
[1:52:25] back. Tommy, I'm sorry.
[1:52:31] But we judge them by their physique.
[1:52:33] Look at him. He is so cute. Oh, isn't he
[1:52:37] a heart throb?
[1:52:39] Look at him. Tall, dark, handsome. Yeah,
[1:52:44] that's right. Hit him again. Lyric.
[1:52:46] Tall, dark, handsome.
[1:52:51] You got Daniel. Pale. Gideon. Pale.
[1:52:55] Paul. Tall. Paul. Paul. Tall. Dark and
[1:53:00] handsome.
[1:53:02] He's a man.
[1:53:07] See, our society don't know what real
[1:53:09] men are, what real women are. Men today
[1:53:11] want to be a woman.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; They paying money to have changes,
[1:53:17] surgical procedures.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; They don't know what it means.
[1:53:23] But see, the Bible tells us in 1st
[1:53:25] Samuel 16:6, "Then it came to pass when
[1:53:28] they come when they were come that he
[1:53:30] looked upon Ilab and he said, "Surely
[1:53:32] the Lord's anointing is before him."
[1:53:34] Talking about Samuel. Now, Samuel's
[1:53:36] about to replace a king.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; He's about to anoint a man to be the
[1:53:40] next king.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; And surely, he's looking, man, Paul, you
[1:53:44] got kingship ability, bro.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; You got it. Look at you tall. Stand up
[1:53:50] for me, Paul. Yeah, I like this.
[1:53:53] tall, dark, and handsome.
[1:53:56] Handsome. Woo. But you know what? God
[1:54:00] said, "Nope.
[1:54:07] Nope.
[1:54:08] He ain't the one."
[1:54:12] Guess what? God said, "Go get that
[1:54:14] little ruddy David.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Go get that little ruddy David. Go get
[1:54:18] that little ruddy David.
[1:54:20] Get that little ruddy David. Oh, he's
[1:54:22] inconspicuous. He ain't tall. He ain't
[1:54:25] dark. He ain't handsome. Yeah, you are.
[1:54:27] But this my story. Oh, but let me tell
[1:54:30] you why. What made the difference? See,
[1:54:32] you and I, we look on the physique. We
[1:54:34] look on the outside appearance. But God
[1:54:36] doesn't look at that. God looks at the
[1:54:38] heart. God's looking at where he placed
[1:54:39] that seed. God's looking for sons of
[1:54:42] God. God's looking for those that he had
[1:54:44] in his thinking before from the
[1:54:46] foundation of the world. You can sit
[1:54:47] down. Notice God was looking for that
[1:54:50] one. You were looking for that one.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; God chooses who he will.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; See, God is looking. He looks on the
[1:55:02] heart looking for that seed. And I love
[1:55:05] how a prophet would say a son of God,
[1:55:07] because I'm giving you all hope this
[1:55:09] evening. A son of God can go a long
[1:55:11] time. He can go a long time before he
[1:55:14] ever recognizes he's a son.
[1:55:18] So don't give up on your loved one.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; I don't care how far they've gone, where
[1:55:22] they are. The prodical son was there
[1:55:25] feeding swine, but God still came by his
[1:55:28] way. If the only time brother Brandham
[1:55:30] ever preached a prodical message, he
[1:55:32] said that an angel of God came to that
[1:55:35] young prodal and tapped him on his side
[1:55:37] and said, "Boy, you've been here long
[1:55:39] enough."
[1:55:41] You don't know when that child, and I
[1:55:44] say child, he can be a 50-year-old child
[1:55:46] wavered.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; He could be a husband wavered. He could
[1:55:49] be a a a mother wavered. A spouse waver.
[1:55:52] A young girl wavered. A young boy
[1:55:54] wavered. We don't know.
[1:55:58] But we must never never give up.
[1:56:03] Let me keep going. Let me finish this up
[1:56:05] and wrap this up. Bring this back down
[1:56:07] to Daniel.
[1:56:14] Notice when Daniel knew that the writing
[1:56:17] was signed,
[1:56:21] he went into his house.
[1:56:24] He didn't cry.
[1:56:28] I don't know why they picking on me. All
[1:56:30] that drama. Old girl got all kind of
[1:56:32] drama. I'm going to tell you, girls got
[1:56:34] more drama.
[1:56:36] We call them drama queens.
[1:56:41] drama queens. I mean, you can be the
[1:56:44] queen of anything, don't be the queen of
[1:56:45] drama.
[1:56:48] But he went into his house after the
[1:56:51] decree was signed.
[1:56:53] And his windows being opened in his
[1:56:55] chamber toward Jerusalem, and he knelt
[1:56:57] down
[1:56:59] three times a day and prayed and gave
[1:57:01] thanks before his God as he did a four
[1:57:04] time. He was well aware of the decree.
[1:57:08] And he was well aware of the
[1:57:10] consequences.
[1:57:12] Yet he had courage.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; He went home. Brother Tommy,
[1:57:19] kicked the trash out. Boys, we ain't
[1:57:22] having this. Girls, we ain't having
[1:57:23] this.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Clean house. Threw the windows open. We
[1:57:28] about to have a family altar. We're
[1:57:29] going to pray this thing all the way
[1:57:31] through. See, he didn't retire to
[1:57:33] another country to escape for a time.
[1:57:35] No, he opened his windows
[1:57:38] and he displayed a man of courage.
[1:57:42] He was confronted with the test, a
[1:57:44] loyalty. He was loyal to the king, but
[1:57:46] he was more loyal to the King of Kings.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; He was obeying obedient to the king. He
[1:57:54] was the next in line to the kingdom, if
[1:57:56] you want to call it that. He was the
[1:57:58] highest that there was outside of the
[1:57:59] King Darius. And yet his main obedience
[1:58:02] was to God Almighty.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:05] And the only thing they found against
[1:58:07] Daniel was against his God.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; See, the power to obey God and stand for
[1:58:14] him comes from a settled understanding
[1:58:16] that God is the one that's really in
[1:58:18] control. And so Daniel didn't let the
[1:58:20] decree change his actions one way or the
[1:58:22] other. He didn't pray anymore. He didn't
[1:58:23] pray any less. He continued with his
[1:58:25] excellent prayer life. And the Bible
[1:58:27] tells us in Ephesians, "Wherefore take
[1:58:28] on you the whole armor of God that you
[1:58:30] may be able to stand in an evil day and
[1:58:33] having done all to stand, stand.
[1:58:37] Stand ready and prepared. Stand
[1:58:40] steadfast of mind. Stand and with no
[1:58:43] hesitation and do not waver, but stand."
[1:58:47] And this phrase be strong and of good
[1:58:50] courage happens nine times in the Old
[1:58:52] Testament. Every time the the the phrase
[1:58:56] is mentioned,
[1:58:58] whether it be Moses speaking, whether it
[1:59:00] be God speaking, he always says, "Be
[1:59:03] strong." Otherwise, be firm and secure
[1:59:08] and be courageous. Be firm in your
[1:59:12] belief
[1:59:14] and be courageous because the Lord thy
[1:59:17] God is the one that fights for you.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; It's not you having to fight for
[1:59:21] yourself. It's not us having to fight
[1:59:23] for each other. God does the fighting.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Now, let me bring this down to a closed
[1:59:28] positions. If you'd make your way back,
[1:59:31] the Bible tells us in Romans, "For as
[1:59:34] many are led by the spirit of God, they
[1:59:36] are the sons of God. For you have not
[1:59:38] received the spirit of bondage to fear,
[1:59:41] but you have received the spirit of
[1:59:42] adoption, whereby we cry, Aba, Father."
[1:59:44] The spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:59:46] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:59:49] God. And if children and heirs, heirs of
[1:59:50] God join with Christ, if so be that we
[1:59:53] suffer with him, we shall also be
[1:59:54] glorified with him. And in 2 Timothy
[1:59:57] 1:7, for God has not given us a spirit
[2:00:00] of fear, but of power and of love and of
[2:00:02] a sound mind.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; That word sound there means discipline,
[2:00:08] self-controlled,
[2:00:10] sound. And in Philippians 2 and verse 5,
[2:00:13] let this mind be in you which was also
[2:00:16] in Christ. He didn't just give you the
[2:00:18] mind of a church. He didn't just give
[2:00:21] you the mind of a preacher, but he gave
[2:00:23] you his mind, the mind of Christ. He
[2:00:27] said, "Be strong. Be of good courage."
[2:00:31] How many of you are familiar with Queen
[2:00:32] Mary or Bloody Mary? If you read any
[2:00:36] history, American, not American history,
[2:00:38] good lord, English history, whatever. As
[2:00:41] I bring this to a close, we find that
[2:00:43] Queen Mary ascended the throne in
[2:00:45] England in 1553.
[2:00:48] And in subsequent years, she had at
[2:00:50] least 200 people put to death, often by
[2:00:53] fire, for their religious convictions.
[2:00:57] She became known to history as Bloody
[2:00:59] Mary.
[2:01:01] And Mary's father was King Henry VIII.
[2:01:04] He has separated the church of England
[2:01:06] from the Roman Catholic Church, but he
[2:01:08] had not reformed the church's practices
[2:01:11] or doctrines. On Henry's death, his
[2:01:13] young son Edward became king. And many
[2:01:15] of Edward's adviserss tried to move the
[2:01:18] church into the direction of a more
[2:01:19] Bible-based Christianity. And two such
[2:01:22] men was Nicholas Ridley and Hugh
[2:01:24] Latimore.
[2:01:25] And we find history tells us that play
[2:01:28] something soft if you would that
[2:01:29] Nicholas Ridley had been a chaplain to
[2:01:32] King Henry VIII and he was a bishop of
[2:01:35] London under his son Edward. He often
[2:01:38] preached and his u he was a preacher
[2:01:41] beloved of his congregation and who was
[2:01:44] very his very life portrayed the truths
[2:01:46] of Christian doctrines in his thought.
[2:01:49] Hugh Latimer also an influential
[2:01:51] preacher under Edward's son or King
[2:01:53] Edward's reign. He was an earnest
[2:01:56] student of the Bible with the bishop of
[2:01:57] Westchester. He encouraged the
[2:01:59] scriptures to be known in English and be
[2:02:02] read by the people. His sermons
[2:02:03] emphasize that men should serve the Lord
[2:02:05] with a true heart and an inward
[2:02:07] affection, not just with an outward
[2:02:09] show. But when Mary came when she came
[2:02:13] to the throne of England,
[2:02:16] she began to work to bring the English
[2:02:18] or bring England back to the Roman
[2:02:20] Catholic Church.
[2:02:23] And one of her first acts was to arrest
[2:02:27] Bishop Ridley and Bishop Latimer.
[2:02:30] To arrest them and after serving time in
[2:02:33] the Tower of London there in Oxford in
[2:02:35] 17 September of 1955, they were sent to
[2:02:39] the Lord's commissioners in Oxford
[2:02:41] Divinity School to be questioned, to be
[2:02:44] tried. And when really was asked if he
[2:02:45] believed that the pope was the heir to
[2:02:47] the authority of Peter as the foundation
[2:02:49] of the church, he replied that the
[2:02:51] church was not built on any man. Let me
[2:02:55] tell you church, today this church of
[2:02:57] God is not built on any man.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care who you put there, he's not
[2:03:02] built on any man. Paul, Peter, James,
[2:03:06] John, Matthew, Luther, Wesley, Brandham.
[2:03:11] He is the church of God is not built on
[2:03:13] a man.
[2:03:16] He replied that the church was not built
[2:03:18] on any man but on the truth that Peter
[2:03:20] confessed that Christ was a son of God.
[2:03:23] Really said that he could not honor the
[2:03:25] pope in Rome since the papacy was
[2:03:26] seeking its own glory not the glory of
[2:03:28] God. Neither really nor Latimer could
[2:03:31] accept the Roman Catholic mass as a
[2:03:33] sacrifice of Christ. Latimer told the
[2:03:36] commissioners, "Christ made one oblation
[2:03:38] and sacrifice for the sins of the world,
[2:03:40] and that was a perfect sacrifice.
[2:03:43] Neither neither there to be nor could
[2:03:45] there be any other proprietary
[2:03:47] sacrifice." These opinions were deeply
[2:03:50] offensive to the Roman Catholic
[2:03:51] theologians. And when Mary came to the
[2:03:54] throne,
[2:03:56] she arrested Hugh Latimer and she
[2:03:58] arrested Bishop Ridley and she sent him
[2:04:02] to be burned at the stake.
[2:04:06] Now, they knew the consequences, Brother
[2:04:08] Tommy
[2:04:11] of their rebuttal.
[2:04:13] They knew that they were going to be
[2:04:18] tried,
[2:04:20] most likely found guilty,
[2:04:23] and sent to the stake to be tied and to
[2:04:27] be burned.
[2:04:31] And neither Ridley nor Latimer cowered
[2:04:34] down.
[2:04:37] Neither Reley or Latimer backed off of
[2:04:40] their convictions.
[2:04:43] And we find Latimer's last words at the
[2:04:46] stake. They're well known.
[2:04:49] And he speaks. He says, "Be of good
[2:04:51] church, a good cheer, master. Really
[2:04:54] play the man.
[2:04:57] Play the man today.
[2:05:00] For we shall this day light such a
[2:05:02] candle in England that I trust by God's
[2:05:04] grace shall never be put out.
[2:05:08] That's what God is looking for today.
[2:05:10] Young people that'll play man. Be a man.
[2:05:14] Have courage in the face of opposition.
[2:05:17] Have courage in the face of fear. Have
[2:05:20] courage is standing to do the right
[2:05:22] thing. And let me say this. Satan has
[2:05:24] done all that he can to minimize to
[2:05:27] destroy the works of God in this hour.
[2:05:30] He tried it in that day. It didn't work
[2:05:32] in that day. He wasn't successful in
[2:05:35] that day. He's tried it in our day. And
[2:05:37] let me just go on record say he's not
[2:05:39] successful today. God has already
[2:05:41] commissioned a word. God has already
[2:05:43] commissioned a people. And I just want
[2:05:44] to tell you again like Bishop Mc Rattley
[2:05:47] here or Ridley here, play the man today.
[2:05:50] Don't be a coward. Don't be a a
[2:05:52] backwashed, a little bitty nothing. Be a
[2:05:54] son of God. Be a man of courage, a woman
[2:05:58] of courage.
[2:06:01] Play the man.
[2:06:05] These men, as I close, were willing to
[2:06:08] give their lives.
[2:06:11] They gave up life rather than compromise
[2:06:14] on the word of God.
[2:06:17] They gave up life
[2:06:21] rather than to negotiate relationship
[2:06:23] for religion because they had a
[2:06:26] relationship with God.
[2:06:28] And notice they did that, brother
[2:06:30] Thomas,
[2:06:31] [Music]
[2:06:32] under their messenger.
[2:06:35] They received the message too, like us.
[2:06:39] But their message came from a reformer
[2:06:42] by the name of Martin Luther. And Luther
[2:06:46] would go and nail the 95 thesis. He was
[2:06:49] protest the Catholic Church. And I say,
[2:06:51] if they could do that under
[2:06:52] justification,
[2:06:54] if they could do that under their
[2:06:56] message, with their messenger, what can
[2:06:58] we do in this hour with our message with
[2:07:01] our messenger with the token life with
[2:07:03] the Holy Ghost on the inside? Can't we
[2:07:06] stand for the truth? Can't we stand for
[2:07:08] the message? Can we be men of courage
[2:07:11] and women of courage? If they can do it
[2:07:14] under theirs, can we do it under ours? I
[2:07:18] say yes, we can. I say yes, we will. We
[2:07:22] will be men and women of courage. We
[2:07:24] will have a backbone. We will not
[2:07:27] surrender. We will not back down.
[2:07:31] We will stand
[2:07:34] [Music]
[2:07:35] in a sinful age and be men and women of
[2:07:40] courage. God bless you church.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Wonderful, wonderful message tonight.

[2:08:02] We love our young people. Amen. In a few
[2:08:05] days. Amen. But they're going to have

[2:08:09] of going to the Ohio youth camp up
[2:08:11] there. Amen. At Dwayne Lawson's. Amen.
[2:08:14] And so, Amen. We are very thankful that
[2:08:17] they get to go and we're going to rent a
[2:08:19] couple vans. Amen. I guess this is the
[2:08:22] first time we've done this in I don't
[2:08:24] know how long it's been, Brother John.
[2:08:27] 15 years maybe. Amen. But we've got
[2:08:30] another wonderful youth group again.

[2:08:39] the young folks that's going to go to
[2:08:40] camp, if you would come up. We want to
[2:08:42] pray with you. Would that be okay? And
[2:08:44] those that are driving or leaders in any
[2:08:46] manner, Amen. Come on up here. Come to
[2:08:48] the front. We're going to be praying for
[2:08:50] you. Okay. All right. Anybody that's

[2:08:54] Amen. Let's pray.

[2:08:58] There you go. Come on up. There you go.
[2:09:01] Don't be shy.
[2:09:03] Amen. All right. Praise the Lord. Now, I
[2:09:06] want you to turn around and face the
[2:09:07] audience if you would first. Amen.
[2:09:12] Because I want to say something about
[2:09:13] you. Amen.
[2:09:17] I don't mean this in a bad way to
[2:09:19] previous youth groups, but I've been
[2:09:22] pastoring for 33 years, and I'm here to
[2:09:24] tell you that this is the best young
[2:09:26] groups we've ever had. Amen. God bless
[2:09:29] you. Amen.
[2:09:34] That's right. Amen. I believe they
[2:09:38] influence you. We have more that try to
[2:09:40] influence each other to the right. Amen.
[2:09:43] I know that when you've got young people
[2:09:45] that are pulling the other young people
[2:09:46] the wrong way, it's not a good thing.
[2:09:48] Amen. You don't want that in a church.
[2:09:50] Amen. And so, we have a group of people
[2:09:53] here that really loves the Lord. Amen.
[2:09:55] And and
[2:09:57] I I'm not God, so I can't give you the
[2:10:00] scale of where these young people are.
[2:10:03] Amen. Perhaps compared to the ones
[2:10:05] before, just like us as Christians.
[2:10:08] Ain't that right? We're supposed to be
[2:10:10] further than Christians before us are.
[2:10:12] Ain't that right? And I believe these
[2:10:13] young people are further than what Amen.
[2:10:16] perhaps a young people from before were.
[2:10:18] But we're very thankful for him. Amen.
[2:10:21] Amen. So, praise the Lord. So, all
