[35:47] good morning brothers and sisters
[35:49] we'll just stand this morning
[35:54] brother brad will open us in prayer this
[35:55] morning
[36:24] and if we go in the psalms we'll go to
[36:26] this
[36:28] psalms 127 just a little real
[36:30] short psalms here the children can be
[36:32] dismissed for sunday school
[36:42] psalms 127
[36:44] just a few little verses
[36:47] except the lord build the house they
[36:49] labor in vain that build it except the
[36:51] lord keep the city the watchmen wakeeth
[36:54] but in vain
[37:05] lo children are a heritage of the lord
[37:08] and the fruit of the womb is his reward
[37:18] happy this one together happy is the man
[37:20] that hath is quiver full of them they
[37:22] shall not be ashamed but they shall
[37:24] speak with the enemies in the gate god
[37:27] bless you may be seated brother brian
[37:39] good morning brothers and sisters
[37:43] according to those scriptures
[37:46] some of you brothers and sisters should
[37:47] get busy
[37:53] if you return with me to uh romans the
[37:56] 11th chapter i wasn't trying to be
[37:59] overly funny there
[38:04] before i get started um
[38:07] uh i sat down i made the church payment
[38:10] yesterday
[38:11] that the normal not exceeding much of
[38:14] the normal amount
[38:17] as of yesterday when i made that
[38:19] principal payment and the interest
[38:20] payment
[38:22] what's left in the uh of principal is 68
[38:26] 000
[38:27] and
[38:28] 6847 and change
[38:31] but something
[38:33] happened a lot this week i don't know
[38:36] i don't know if it happened to some of
[38:37] you all the church was on a
[38:40] it makes no sense saying that way we we
[38:43] had a
[38:44] fixed rate for so long and then it went
[38:46] to an adjustable rate so for the last
[38:49] couple of years it actually dropped a
[38:51] couple of years ago
[38:54] went up last year like a quarter point
[38:57] but this year
[38:59] this week it went up a whole percentage
[39:01] so it was four and a half last month
[39:04] come september the september payment is
[39:06] going to be five and a half percent
[39:08] and um i said i figured this out that
[39:12] if just doing the normal payment
[39:16] we would have uh 53 payments left
[39:18] basically
[39:20] on the loan
[39:21] four years and five months now of course
[39:23] i know a lot of you know that that's not
[39:26] fixed as i
[39:29] pay more principal the the years the
[39:32] amount of months at the end of the loan
[39:33] are going to change but that's just a
[39:35] rough estimate
[39:36] you know where we stand as a church
[39:39] paying off the uh paying off the loan
[39:42] that's a long way from where we started
[39:44] like i told you we took
[39:46] initially took out 175
[39:49] 000
[39:50] then we we when we did the original loan
[39:53] we had a plus up available up to 200 000
[39:56] and we took a 200 000 brothers and
[39:58] sisters
[40:00] that doesn't even touch the bucket how
[40:01] much it was actually put in the church
[40:04] over those
[40:05] couple of years we when we put it
[40:07] together whether it's your own personal
[40:09] labor or your own personal finances as
[40:11] you all know 200 000 dollars couldn't
[40:13] have built a church like this so the
[40:15] lord has
[40:16] truly blessed us but going back to the
[40:21] to this eleventh chapter i was sitting
[40:23] there thinking this morning
[40:27] and i
[40:31] and i was reading some stuff and i was
[40:33] reading about this man
[40:35] reading other people's writings and
[40:37] stuff and i was reading about this man
[40:39] this has been probably over a hundred
[40:41] years ago
[40:42] and he was a you know he was going to a
[40:45] samurai he was wanting to be a
[40:47] theologian
[40:48] and he was after all those years you
[40:52] know reading
[40:53] studying and believing he still he was
[40:56] he was very stressful
[40:58] very stressful about his circumstances
[41:00] about the word of god and the truths
[41:03] that were presented in it
[41:05] and then one day he just realized that
[41:07] he just simply
[41:09] had to accept what god wanted to do for
[41:12] him it wasn't all not that the education
[41:14] was bad or good it wasn't none of that
[41:17] really mattered
[41:18] it was just simply believing christ in
[41:21] believing what god
[41:23] purpose is for you as an individual just
[41:26] simply accepting it and reaching out in
[41:29] faith but he realizes all that was
[41:32] required of them now paul also said that
[41:35] you have to work out your salvation with
[41:37] fear and trembling it doesn't take that
[41:39] away but that fear and trembling and
[41:41] that conviction that comes upon your
[41:43] heart and life brings you to a point
[41:46] where you realize just like in john
[41:48] bunyan wrote in all his books that you
[41:50] simply have to reach out in faith
[41:53] and accept what god has done for you and
[41:56] that's a daily walk that we all have to
[41:58] take every day as whether you're young
[42:00] or you're old whatever situation you're
[42:03] in your enemy's goal is to put you in
[42:06] such a stressful life
[42:08] that you're looking at the wrong things
[42:11] and trying to keep you from looking at
[42:14] the right things and and
[42:17] when i was reading this morning in that
[42:19] thing that man finally realized that no
[42:21] matter what the world or whatever was
[42:23] going on
[42:24] uh he just simply had to reach out in
[42:27] faith and walk where god was leading him
[42:29] and once you have that you know brother
[42:31] branham talk about it a lot once you
[42:33] have that
[42:34] that tie post that stake in the ground
[42:37] that you know that god has done
[42:38] something for you
[42:39] whatever that is whether it's a
[42:41] revelation of the word of god and how
[42:44] god speaks to you everyone is different
[42:46] once you have that experience
[42:48] you can't be tricky anymore you know
[42:50] that god is real
[42:52] and then no matter what happens you can
[42:54] know that you can trust him
[42:56] to bring you to that final destination
[42:58] that we all desire to bring in and i was
[43:01] uh
[43:02] not trying to be funny here i was just
[43:03] thinking you know especially you younger
[43:06] men and women
[43:08] you know you hadn't had those
[43:09] experiences in the life of ups and downs
[43:12] as many ups and downs as you get older
[43:14] and that's not a good thing sometimes
[43:16] when you get older it makes you hard
[43:18] makes you crusty
[43:20] makes you you know trusting you
[43:22] yourself more than you trust in god but
[43:26] people and i think they know so much
[43:29] you know what's funny about it is
[43:32] you know i
[43:33] i do a business that
[43:36] everything i do is based on national law
[43:38] if you it's gonna do the same thing
[43:41] every time time and time again if you do
[43:44] it the right way and i was just thinking
[43:46] those there's those people out there
[43:48] that put science above religion or put
[43:51] their own understanding above anything
[43:54] else but you'll find out that those same
[43:56] people that are trusting in the natural
[43:58] laws of god and don't believe in a god
[44:01] what's so funny about them
[44:03] is that they'll fight you the hardest if
[44:06] there is no god or if there is no truth
[44:09] then why do they fight you so much i
[44:11] mean it's just a revelation got to
[44:13] realize it's that they fight you so much
[44:16] about something that they don't believe
[44:18] it just to me i find it funny sometimes
[44:20] but going going hearing this uh
[44:23] i wrote this down i hope i
[44:27] i'll just start at this 12th chapter not
[44:29] wanting to take a lot of time
[44:31] you know we all
[44:33] have to work out our salvation with fear
[44:35] and trembling and the understanding that
[44:38] i'm that's not that's not what i'm
[44:39] reading in my notes but i just feel it
[44:40] in my heart that every man and woman
[44:43] here or in the world has to come to that
[44:46] place where they have to realize that
[44:48] god has a true purpose for you
[44:51] and for your life and you just gotta
[44:52] surrender i mean you know i remember
[44:54] being a younger man that's one thing i
[44:56] would never do i would never surrender
[44:58] to god's will
[45:00] and then you find out as you get older
[45:02] but more that you choose not to
[45:03] surrender to god's will the harder your
[45:06] life will get once you realize that then
[45:09] you'll just simply surrender i know it
[45:10] you can talk about it
[45:13] you can preach about it you can do all
[45:15] things about it but every individual
[45:17] simply has to do that themselves but let
[45:20] me read a little bit out of this 12th
[45:22] chapter
[45:23] but i can tell you one thing i and i'm
[45:25] on another candidate again but i've i
[45:28] the one thing i learned
[45:29] myself i can only speak for myself
[45:33] a lot of times when i was a younger man
[45:35] i always wondered who could i trust who
[45:38] could put i put my confidence in you
[45:40] know in a natural sense i i you know i
[45:43] wasn't raised in a christian home but
[45:46] who could i trust who could i have
[45:47] confidence in and all you men and women
[45:50] have known that as you get older you see
[45:52] people that you thought you could have
[45:54] confidence in and you see them fail
[45:56] make mistakes that you thought that they
[45:58] never mistake
[46:00] that shouldn't shake you and i was
[46:01] thinking
[46:02] i realized that when god was speaking me
[46:05] the only thing i could have confidence
[46:07] in that i could have trust in is himself
[46:10] i could only trust jesus christ and
[46:13] anything that was affecting me that's
[46:15] the only thing as a man as for speaking
[46:18] for myself that i could trust god's word
[46:21] and what he's taught me and what i've
[46:23] been led to believe that's the only
[46:24] thing i can trust anything outside of
[46:27] that i found that if i was trusting too
[46:29] much in the things of the world it was
[46:31] going to fall apart one day but i'll
[46:33] just read from this um
[46:36] uh these scriptures here in the 12th
[46:37] chapter of romans you know
[46:40] paul was talking to the gentiles
[46:42] in the 11th chapter he's talking to the
[46:44] gentiles saying how god loved him so
[46:47] much that he took the real branch god's
[46:49] branch and took it out of the tree and
[46:51] set it aside so he could bring us into
[46:53] that tree and feed us from the word of
[46:56] god and freedom from his spirit and he's
[46:58] talking to the gentiles and telling them
[47:01] not to become not to think of themselves
[47:03] greater than what they really are
[47:05] because the same god that took that
[47:08] pure branch and took it out and put the
[47:10] wild branch in could take us out and i'm
[47:12] and i'm just thinking we're so many
[47:14] years past that point right now
[47:16] and everyone in the world that we live
[47:18] in takes it for granted now like it's
[47:20] always going to be there and we know by
[47:22] the message of the hour and the word of
[47:24] god it's not always going to be there
[47:26] god is only coming for those that he
[47:28] knows and those that are our zone but
[47:30] i'll just read this and sit down i
[47:32] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[47:34] mercy of god
[47:36] that you present your body is a living
[47:38] sacrifice holy and acceptable on the god
[47:41] which is your reasonable service
[47:43] so paul's talking here he's not asking
[47:46] us to do anything more than what god
[47:48] expects us to do
[47:50] you know a lot of times we want to do
[47:52] the great things and god
[47:54] wants you to do the simple things that's
[47:56] it's just just especially man that's
[47:58] just how they are they think that they
[48:00] have to do this great thing but around
[48:02] their close part of their life they're
[48:04] not doing the little things and be not
[48:06] conformed to the world but be
[48:08] transformed by the renewing of your
[48:10] minds that you may prove what is good
[48:12] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[48:16] for i say through the grace given unto
[48:17] me to every man that is among you not to
[48:20] think of himself more highly than he
[48:21] ought to
[48:22] think but to think soberly according to
[48:25] us god had dealt to every man the
[48:27] measure of faith and that's that's a
[48:30] true statement
[48:31] you know
[48:32] any time god puts you in a position
[48:34] whether it's in a spiritual position or
[48:37] even out in a job
[48:39] when you think that
[48:40] when you when you start thinking in your
[48:42] heart and in your life
[48:44] that without you nothing is going to
[48:46] work and nothing's going to be able to
[48:48] move without you then you put yourself
[48:50] in a bad place that
[48:52] you know that's a common problem in the
[48:54] world people suffer from self-importance
[48:57] and he goes on to say whereas
[48:59] many members in one body all members not
[49:02] of the same office my point being no
[49:04] matter what you're doing there's always
[49:05] someone that can do it better once you
[49:07] have that revelation you realize you're
[49:09] not as important as you think you are
[49:12] and that makes you more willing to
[49:13] accept counsel accept advice or look for
[49:16] a better way to do something and for as
[49:19] many members are in one body all members
[49:21] are
[49:21] not the same office so we bring
[49:24] many as one body in christ that everyone
[49:26] remembers one of another
[49:29] having the gifts different according to
[49:30] the grace that is given to us well the
[49:32] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[49:35] the portion of faith i'll just finish
[49:38] what paul is saying there you know god
[49:41] gives every man and every woman
[49:42] different gifts
[49:45] and the way a man and a woman should
[49:46] accept that
[49:48] is that if you know that god has given
[49:49] you a gift you shouldn't be
[49:51] upset or envious or jealous over another
[49:55] man's gift or another woman's gift just
[49:57] stay in your lane in life that's what
[49:59] you know that's the hard thing i see in
[50:00] this world god gives us the lane
[50:02] he tells us what he wants to be and what
[50:04] he wants us to do
[50:06] and sometimes we've got to be in
[50:07] everyone else's lane instead of in our
[50:09] own lane and that's where we need to be
[50:11] as christian what god is leading you to
[50:13] do if he's touching your heart to do
[50:15] something just stay in faith and believe
[50:17] what he's got for you to do brother josh
[50:30] [Applause]

[1:17:54] the reading you can be seated
[1:17:56] my title this morning is i shall not
[1:18:00] want
[1:18:02] amen amen i was messing with my cows and
[1:18:05] different things out there and of course
[1:18:07] always having trying to have my mind on
[1:18:09] the lord and and just seeing what the
[1:18:11] lord would have to speak and that's the
[1:18:13] scripture that came to my mind amen
[1:18:15] and so i was just inspired by it and so
[1:18:18] we want to try to minister on that with
[1:18:20] the help of the lord amen
[1:18:23] amen now first i want to speak to you
[1:18:25] and give you a couple quotes of what the
[1:18:26] prophet god said about amen a god's
[1:18:30] untapped resources amen
[1:18:32] amen untapped resources that we have
[1:18:35] he says you know
[1:18:38] he says my grandfather he says wrote an
[1:18:40] ox card he says and i'm driving a ford
[1:18:43] v8
[1:18:45] all right my son will fly a jet plane
[1:18:48] that's he says that just we're just
[1:18:49] moving on
[1:18:51] that's what religion ought to be the
[1:18:53] coming of the lord is at hand the church
[1:18:55] ought to be moving on up into powers
[1:18:59] amen
[1:19:01] science can only climb so high and he
[1:19:04] goes into describing of where
[1:19:06] how science has come we look at where
[1:19:08] science has come from right
[1:19:10] look at how it's progressed in 100 years
[1:19:13] amen
[1:19:14] all right
[1:19:18] he said science can only climb so far
[1:19:20] and then it has to drop off
[1:19:22] okay
[1:19:23] but we've got
[1:19:25] untapped sources or resources in other
[1:19:28] places yes
[1:19:29] that's never been touched of the power
[1:19:32] unlimited of god that we ought to be
[1:19:35] moving into
[1:19:37] he says we're living a million miles
[1:19:40] under our privileges tonight
[1:19:43] our privilege of that the
[1:19:45] creations ought to be enjoying
[1:19:48] another one he says well that's what the
[1:19:49] pentecostal church as soon as it was
[1:19:51] born and uh or any church when it's born
[1:19:55] into the kingdom of god it becomes sons
[1:19:57] and daughters of god but we stopped that
[1:19:59] that when the pentecostal church
[1:20:01] received the gift of speaking in tongues
[1:20:03] and interpretation
[1:20:05] based out there
[1:20:08] amen
[1:20:11] how many knows it's not it's important
[1:20:13] not to stop
[1:20:16] if i could say anything this morning you
[1:20:18] could see where you're at now with the
[1:20:20] lord and ask yourself this question
[1:20:24] are you daily progressing
[1:20:30] are you a better christian than you was
[1:20:32] last week
[1:20:34] or last month or last year if you can't
[1:20:37] really say yeah i've really gotten a lot
[1:20:40] closer to the lord
[1:20:42] then you need to repent
[1:20:46] because that's not where god wants us he
[1:20:48] don't want us to stay in one place
[1:20:50] he wants us to continuously to progress
[1:20:54] in him
[1:20:56] amen
[1:20:58] my
[1:20:59] let me see
[1:21:02] that's right they stopped at that
[1:21:04] there's no place to stop
[1:21:07] amen that's the place to begin
[1:21:10] we've got untapped resources everywhere
[1:21:14] amen
[1:21:15] now
[1:21:16] you want to see what some of those
[1:21:18] things are and i'm going to show you
[1:21:19] with the help of the lord what that
[1:21:21] resource that untapped resource is
[1:21:24] is that okay
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:29] untapped resource
[1:21:32] amen
[1:21:34] all right we've got untapped resources
[1:21:36] everywhere it says all things are
[1:21:39] possible to them that believe
[1:21:43] there's your resource
[1:21:45] if thou canst believe all things are
[1:21:48] possible
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:53] i am sure
[1:21:55] that probably every one of us
[1:21:58] has asked god for things we didn't get
[1:22:00] it and so forth perhaps and somehow in
[1:22:03] our mind that's kind of hard to believe
[1:22:05] because perhaps you failed you didn't
[1:22:07] ask you didn't get what you asked for
[1:22:10] huh
[1:22:11] and it's so big that you can't say of
[1:22:13] yourself yeah i believe that truly
[1:22:17] huh
[1:22:19] ask anything in my name
[1:22:22] and i will do it
[1:22:24] huh
[1:22:27] that's pretty big isn't it
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:31] if thou can't believe
[1:22:33] all things are possible
[1:22:36] praise the lord
[1:22:39] now go back to the scripture of psalms
[1:22:42] 23
[1:22:43] i like david i like david's life i like
[1:22:46] the examples that you can pull from
[1:22:48] david i like his scriptures here because
[1:22:50] david here i believe is talking about
[1:22:54] his shepherd
[1:22:55] what god meant to him
[1:22:59] amen what god meant to him
[1:23:01] he said the lord is my shepherd
[1:23:05] i will not need
[1:23:09] i will not lack
[1:23:11] i will not want
[1:23:15] amen
[1:23:19] praise the lord think about it
[1:23:21] if he is your shepherd
[1:23:24] you're not going to lack
[1:23:30] you are not going to need
[1:23:33] anything
[1:23:35] or should i say
[1:23:36] have to need anything because he's going
[1:23:38] to supply for you
[1:23:41] praise the lord
[1:23:43] i'm being mad for that promise that when
[1:23:45] he's your shepherd i shall not won
[1:23:50] glory david didn't have much
[1:23:54] when the bear came when the lion came
[1:23:56] isn't that right all he had is slain
[1:23:58] [Applause]
[1:23:59] and
[1:24:00] god that was the key it didn't matter
[1:24:03] how little it was
[1:24:06] it's just this lingering stone don't
[1:24:08] look much to me
[1:24:10] all of us would say brother brad i'm on
[1:24:12] a pretty big caliber gun
[1:24:16] brother austin i want one of them
[1:24:18] big guns something that'll just blow him
[1:24:20] to pieces right
[1:24:23] but surely don't give me no clean stone
[1:24:27] but no it did not
[1:24:28] david had god he didn't need anything
[1:24:32] more
[1:24:33] i believe he could have punched him in
[1:24:35] the face and killed him if he needed to
[1:24:39] is that right how about samson samson
[1:24:41] knew what it was not the need not to
[1:24:44] want not to lack
[1:24:46] when he had god
[1:24:51] that's what the world lacks remember
[1:24:53] there's you know i believe it was a uh
[1:24:57] belty shazer where that handwriting on
[1:24:59] the wall that came down he says you've
[1:25:01] been weighed in the balance and found
[1:25:03] lacking
[1:25:05] you've been found wanting you're not
[1:25:07] what you ought to be you're wrong you're
[1:25:09] off
[1:25:10] you're lacking
[1:25:14] boy boy i'll tell you what
[1:25:16] i wonder if we looked in our lives how
[1:25:18] much we're lacking
[1:25:20] huh
[1:25:22] but god don't want you to
[1:25:24] lack amen he wants you to give you
[1:25:27] everything that you have need of
[1:25:33] praise the lord
[1:25:37] i believe it's paul that said in
[1:25:40] philippians
[1:25:42] my god but my god shall supply
[1:25:46] all your
[1:25:49] need
[1:25:54] according to his richest in glory
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:00] and i'd imagine there is some serious
[1:26:02] riches in glory
[1:26:05] what is that riches that riches is that
[1:26:08] god can take care of any problem that
[1:26:10] you got
[1:26:12] he can supply anything that you have
[1:26:14] need of
[1:26:15] that's the richest
[1:26:18] how many know that's a serious risk
[1:26:19] great and precious promises through
[1:26:23] christ jesus paul said
[1:26:25] how many that's how you receive these
[1:26:28] riches that's how you have all of your
[1:26:30] things supplied is because and through
[1:26:33] jesus christ
[1:26:36] the greatest name name there's no higher
[1:26:38] name than jesus christ
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:49] in matthew
[1:26:52] 7 and 7 it says
[1:26:56] ask
[1:26:57] and it shall be given to you
[1:27:00] huh
[1:27:01] y'all just hang on man
[1:27:04] hang in there
[1:27:06] ask and it shall be given unto you
[1:27:10] seek and ye shall fly
[1:27:15] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[1:27:19] huh praise the lord think about it
[1:27:27] god is good isn't he
[1:27:30] ask and it shall be given unto you
[1:27:34] seek
[1:27:35] and so forth
[1:27:37] brother brother begins makes a statement
[1:27:38] and quote he says we have
[1:27:40] no need
[1:27:42] or lack
[1:27:44] of anything
[1:27:49] praise the lord
[1:27:50] why
[1:27:52] because it has all how many knows that
[1:27:54] it's all been supplied
[1:27:58] it has been given to us what you have
[1:28:00] need of
[1:28:03] your need has been supplied let's all
[1:28:06] say that my need has been supplied
[1:28:12] you see we think that we need a whole
[1:28:13] bunch of stuff we don't need
[1:28:16] that's where the problem comes in well i
[1:28:17] need this not need that no
[1:28:20] you need what god has for you that's
[1:28:22] what you truly need
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:26] paul didn't have a whole lot think about
[1:28:28] it just the same scripture the same
[1:28:30] chapter he paul says i know how to have
[1:28:32] much i know how to have little i can do
[1:28:34] all things through christ with
[1:28:35] strengthen me and just a few more
[1:28:37] scriptures is everybody tells you that
[1:28:39] god is going to supply your need
[1:28:43] amen
[1:28:45] paul knew what it was like not to lack
[1:28:47] paul didn't like he had everything that
[1:28:50] god wanted him to have
[1:28:52] everything that he had needed
[1:28:56] when he come to the door of death he had
[1:28:58] he had need of victory didn't he
[1:29:02] amen he says
[1:29:03] i thank god
[1:29:05] through christ jesus who gives us the
[1:29:06] victory this thing of death has been
[1:29:08] taken away and everything else
[1:29:10] god had given him the victory
[1:29:13] praise the lord
[1:29:15] oh i like that don't you
[1:29:19] again a quote brother bam says that's
[1:29:22] the way that we are when we receive the
[1:29:24] baptism of the holy ghost praise be to
[1:29:26] god all right here we go are you ready
[1:29:29] i'm telling you i know we hear these
[1:29:31] quotes maybe all our life but god help
[1:29:34] you this morning if you'll just
[1:29:36] just
[1:29:37] do whatever you got to do to try to make
[1:29:39] this real to yourself
[1:29:41] huh
[1:29:43] i believe that these things are there
[1:29:45] and we just
[1:29:47] have them as a memory
[1:29:50] but i don't know about you but i want it
[1:29:52] to be not a memory or a thought or a
[1:29:54] quote i want it to be a reality
[1:29:57] how many with me
[1:29:59] i want this to be a reality
[1:30:02] i believe in the church age book the man
[1:30:04] talked about he says we've got the word
[1:30:06] it's just that it's not real to people
[1:30:09] i believe that's the problem is that the
[1:30:10] word of god is not real to people
[1:30:14] not a reality but when you get the
[1:30:16] baptism in the holy ghost
[1:30:18] to you sick people now and to you that
[1:30:22] are born again of the spirit of god when
[1:30:24] god planted you in christ
[1:30:27] which is the inexhaustible fountain of
[1:30:30] lives
[1:30:31] amen
[1:30:32] now we're tapping into it aren't we
[1:30:35] we're tapping into untapped resources
[1:30:38] people that don't have god
[1:30:40] need to tap in
[1:30:42] you need the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:45] you tap into the
[1:30:46] inexhaustible fountain of life
[1:30:48] constantly flowing
[1:30:52] can i just say what comes to mind
[1:30:55] thank you brother chris anybody else
[1:30:59] think about it when you get and you get
[1:31:02] capped into christ
[1:31:04] it should never
[1:31:06] run dry or dull
[1:31:12] it's a constant flowing stream
[1:31:15] amen
[1:31:17] praise god
[1:31:20] which is the inexhaustible fountain of
[1:31:23] life and
[1:31:24] everything that you need
[1:31:27] was put in you
[1:31:29] when you receive the holy ghost
[1:31:34] for your life's journey
[1:31:37] and he also says for this world and for
[1:31:40] everything else
[1:31:42] everything is in you then
[1:31:44] [Applause]
[1:31:47] your healing salvation joy happiness it
[1:31:51] don't matter it's in you now

[1:32:08] there you just have to let it loose go
[1:32:11] to pushing go to drinking like a tree
[1:32:13] that's planted you it just needs water
[1:32:18] how many knows here not so long ago we
[1:32:20] had almost a drought around here it's so
[1:32:22] dry
[1:32:23] it was so dry my grass wouldn't grow
[1:32:27] huh
[1:32:29] i was hoping my pasture fields would get
[1:32:31] enough grass last through october
[1:32:33] november so i don't have to feed till
[1:32:35] december
[1:32:36] and it wasn't growing as this isn't
[1:32:37] going to happen
[1:32:39] but hallelujah praise god we got some
[1:32:41] rain didn't we

[1:33:32] deeper depth higher height
[1:33:36] amen
[1:33:39] it's all there
[1:33:40] [Applause]
[1:33:42] you don't need it don't need some divine
[1:33:44] healer to come by to heal you

[1:33:58] faith that's okay

[1:34:30] have faith like jesus have faith in god
[1:34:36] i was listening to a tape the other day
[1:34:38] and brother bam was talking about when
[1:34:39] you want something from god you don't
[1:34:40] have to have extraordinary faith
[1:34:43] so for faith he says just believe what
[1:34:46] god said accept it and go on
[1:34:49] and i'm like what he's telling if you
[1:34:51] don't want to have to have that super
[1:34:52] faith that you think about no you just
[1:34:54] have to believe god said it i believe it
[1:34:59] that settles it and take it and go
[1:35:03] amen
[1:35:05] go on and act like it's already done
[1:35:09] praise be to god
[1:35:12] hallelujah
[1:35:15] god he's good isn't he
[1:35:17] amen
[1:35:19] see
[1:35:20] you don't have to come by and heal your
[1:35:21] divine healing has already been
[1:35:23] purchased at calvary the only thing you
[1:35:26] have to do is you're planted in christ
[1:35:28] drink from the fountain that never runs
[1:35:31] dry
[1:35:33] praise the lord
[1:35:36] we already taught here and won't teach
[1:35:38] it too much here i mean this morning
[1:35:40] dwell on it should i say too much this
[1:35:42] morning and that is that every promise
[1:35:44] of god and and brother brown other
[1:35:46] places said that you know it's when
[1:35:47] jesus said it was finished he was
[1:35:49] finished
[1:35:50] he said if he was here he couldn't heal
[1:35:52] you have to accept what he's already
[1:35:54] done how many knows if jesus himself
[1:35:57] here was trying to hear he all he can do
[1:35:59] is promote you to believe
[1:36:02] you'd still have to reach that level of
[1:36:04] faith
[1:36:06] and accept that because he had many
[1:36:08] crowds it's just a few people would a
[1:36:09] lot of times get healed
[1:36:12] amen we already have jesus here can we
[1:36:14] say we already have jesus he's already
[1:36:16] here he's in your heart he's right in
[1:36:18] here he's just waiting for you to
[1:36:19] believe him
[1:36:21] to accept it
[1:36:24] and live like it's already done
[1:36:28] i think i
[1:36:29] preached a whole sermon on he can't do a
[1:36:30] thing for you until you accept that it's
[1:36:33] already finished
[1:36:34] until you accept it's already done he
[1:36:36] can't do anything for you
[1:36:38] you have to accept what he did
[1:36:41] amen have faith jesus christ the son of
[1:36:44] god is here to take over everything that
[1:36:47] you have need of he promised to supply
[1:36:50] your need from your birth to the end of
[1:36:53] your life
[1:36:56] praise the lord
[1:36:58] uh aren't you glad for that
[1:37:00] to the end of your life
[1:37:02] well let's see if this is really true
[1:37:05] saint john 14 jesus said to his
[1:37:07] disciples don't let your hearts be
[1:37:09] troubled
[1:37:13] you believe in god you believe also in
[1:37:15] me
[1:37:16] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:37:18] and if it were not so i would have told
[1:37:20] you
[1:37:21] and i go to prepare a place for you
[1:37:27] amen
[1:37:28] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[1:37:30] i will come again and receive you unto
[1:37:32] myself that where i am there you may be
[1:37:34] also
[1:37:36] so just think about this morning of
[1:37:38] jesus
[1:37:39] jesus told
[1:37:40] his disciples look i'm going to go away
[1:37:42] we're going to talk about the hereafter
[1:37:44] a little bit
[1:37:45] and i'm telling you i'm going to win i'm
[1:37:46] going to go prepare a place for you
[1:37:48] according to the prophet of god he's
[1:37:50] already building that new jerusalem over
[1:37:52] there we don't know what all know what
[1:37:55] all is going on over there
[1:37:57] he's creating all kinds of new things in
[1:37:59] a new jerusalem for us to dwell dwell in
[1:38:04] they're busy over there
[1:38:06] everything's under construction heaven a
[1:38:08] place for us so that whenever wherever
[1:38:10] he is there will be elsa if jesus would
[1:38:13] be concerned about where we're gonna be
[1:38:15] after this don't you think he's already
[1:38:17] taken care of everything over here too
[1:38:21] sure
[1:38:22] he's already taken care of it
[1:38:25] this morning i'm here to tell you that i
[1:38:27] believe that whatever trial whatever
[1:38:29] whatever problem whatever it comes in my
[1:38:31] life
[1:38:33] or your life
[1:38:34] he's already got a way of escape he's
[1:38:36] already made it away for you
[1:38:39] huh
[1:38:40] all you have to do is yield to him
[1:38:43] all you have to say lord
[1:38:45] i'm trusting you in this
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:48] because nothing
[1:38:49] comes on you
[1:38:51] nothing comes on me without god's
[1:38:53] permission
[1:38:55] so whatever comes remember it was
[1:38:57] permitted by god and it's for a purpose
[1:39:01] amen when you got that you know god's
[1:39:04] got it under control
[1:39:08] hallelujah
[1:39:10] praise the lord
[1:39:14] now
[1:39:16] that's right from birth to the end of
[1:39:18] your life that's the way it is with the
[1:39:20] christian life we are planted together
[1:39:22] in christ jesus who is the inexhaustible
[1:39:24] fountain of life we're planted in christ
[1:39:26] and then we just drink and drink and
[1:39:28] drink and push out
[1:39:30] and everything that we're in need of in
[1:39:32] this life's journey divine healing
[1:39:34] powers of god all these other things
[1:39:36] is in the engine individual here
[1:39:40] that's received the baptism of the holy
[1:39:42] ghost
[1:39:44] for you're planted in christ hallelujah
[1:39:46] the holy spirit yes sir and everything
[1:39:49] you have need of in his life's journey
[1:39:52] even the rapture is in you then
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:39:57] calm down people
[1:40:00] even the rapture is in you
[1:40:06] man the more i think about that to
[1:40:08] realize it's already there
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:11] don't have to wait for it it's in there
[1:40:14] christ
[1:40:15] is the rapture
[1:40:18] and the scripture that comes to my mind
[1:40:22] to justify a statement like that
[1:40:25] would be
[1:40:26] when he was there with marth and mary
[1:40:29] they wanted lazarus to raise up
[1:40:31] what'd he say
[1:40:32] i am the resurrection
[1:40:35] and the life
[1:40:37] so if you've got him you've got the
[1:40:39] resurrection
[1:40:41] in you
[1:40:44] always is scripture always backed up
[1:40:46] amen
[1:40:47] aren't you glad for that even the
[1:40:49] rapture is in you that's the truth the
[1:40:51] rapture is in us now
[1:40:53] oh my first he said don't resent that
[1:40:58] don't resent that
[1:41:01] i'll tell you resentment targets the
[1:41:03] word of god can lead you in bad places
[1:41:06] amen because if you resent the truth
[1:41:09] there's something wrong with you
[1:41:12] something wrong with your spirit for
[1:41:13] resenting the truth
[1:41:16] amen but people did it apparently
[1:41:18] prophet got picked up on that amen
[1:41:21] oh my
[1:41:23] he used the scripture as all he has
[1:41:26] predestinated he's justified isn't that
[1:41:29] right
[1:41:30] and all who has justified he has already
[1:41:33] already
[1:41:35] glorified
[1:41:37] praise the lord he's already done the
[1:41:39] work it's already done
[1:41:42] amen praise the lord we're just waiting
[1:41:44] for the time how many believes that
[1:41:46] we're just waiting for the time
[1:41:48] but you've got to be part of the first
[1:41:50] resurrection you've got to be part of
[1:41:52] the resurrection that you who were once
[1:41:54] dead and sins now are alive and
[1:41:56] quickened unto god let me know that
[1:41:57] we've had the resurrection in the
[1:41:59] spiritual realm but we're certainly
[1:42:01] looking for a resurrection to this thing
[1:42:02] a body change
[1:42:04] praise be to god
[1:42:06] how many believes that
[1:42:08] oh my hallelujah
[1:42:11] we think about samson
[1:42:15] amen god supplied his need didn't he
[1:42:20] he did not lack
[1:42:22] i mean he lacked the army
[1:42:25] he lost he lacked tens of thousands of
[1:42:28] soldiers
[1:42:30] huh
[1:42:33] one man
[1:42:36] going up against perhaps tens of
[1:42:39] thousands
[1:42:40] it said he killed a thousand the rest of
[1:42:42] them ran probably right i didn't know
[1:42:44] telling how many there actually was
[1:42:46] one man taking on a whole army
[1:42:51] amen
[1:42:52] he did not lie he could testify this
[1:42:54] morning i know what it's like not the
[1:42:56] lack
[1:42:58] amen until i lost the holy ghost or
[1:43:00] until i got away from god then you're
[1:43:02] going to lack
[1:43:05] oh yeah you're going to lack then
[1:43:07] but as long as you're in christ you're
[1:43:08] not going gonna lie as long as he's your
[1:43:10] shepherd you're not gonna laugh
[1:43:13] now no doubt samson could have done it
[1:43:15] with his fist too probably
[1:43:17] but he looked around for some kind of
[1:43:19] weapon and looked around and he said the
[1:43:21] bible says he got a dry jawbone
[1:43:25] old dried up jawbone of a mule right
[1:43:28] picked it up
[1:43:30] and as the prophet put it was slamming
[1:43:32] that guy's helmet snowed out
[1:43:35] probably hit their helmets so hard until
[1:43:38] they fractured their head now can you
[1:43:40] imagine what it would do to a dry
[1:43:42] jawbone
[1:43:43] the splintering that would take place
[1:43:48] hallelujah
[1:43:49] he could praise be the god it's not
[1:43:51] samson it's not the job only it's god
[1:43:55] that caused him not to lack david with
[1:43:57] the bear he didn't like he didn't like
[1:43:59] when it comes to goliath
[1:44:02] oh my
[1:44:04] moses didn't lack
[1:44:06] god doesn't want his children to lack do
[1:44:08] you want your children to like
[1:44:11] no you don't want your children to lack
[1:44:13] you want to teach them everything they
[1:44:14] need to know and you want to supply them
[1:44:16] with what they have need of
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:18] how careful we are to make sure we have
[1:44:20] the right vitamins and all this that and
[1:44:22] the other that you eat your beans that
[1:44:24] you eat your corn to eat your meat to
[1:44:26] make sure they're all healthy
[1:44:29] do our best
[1:44:31] to make sure that our children are
[1:44:32] healthy that they're taken care of what
[1:44:35] about us who are the armies of the
[1:44:37] living god will let god supply you with
[1:44:39] the weapons that you need
[1:44:42] with the power that you need
[1:44:44] to fight this battle
[1:44:47] in this layout i see age that we're
[1:44:49] living in
[1:44:50] amen
[1:44:52] folks we got to go higher
[1:44:55] you're going to have to get closer to
[1:44:57] god
[1:44:59] are you with me
[1:45:01] as we go on we got to get closer
[1:45:04] we got to become better closer more like
[1:45:07] christ
[1:45:08] all the time
[1:45:10] praise be to god
[1:45:13] live or die
[1:45:16] live or die
[1:45:18] live for christ
[1:45:21] amen praise the lord tapping into the
[1:45:23] resource i mean believe it
[1:45:25] when you tap oh my at the thought
[1:45:28] when
[1:45:29] you
[1:45:30] tap into god you have tapped into those
[1:45:34] resources
[1:45:39] those untapped resources
[1:45:41] amen how many believes that because
[1:45:43] you've done tapped into everything
[1:45:46] huh
[1:45:47] everything that you have need of
[1:45:50] praise be to god
[1:45:54] you know
[1:45:56] but peter put it this way
[1:45:59] when he was talking about
[1:46:02] partakers of the precious promises
[1:46:05] and so forth
[1:46:06] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:46:11] the
[1:46:12] divine
[1:46:14] nature
[1:46:16] so what was peter talking about he was
[1:46:18] talking about a nature change for us
[1:46:20] wasn't he
[1:46:24] because everything else is external
[1:46:25] folks like i said wednesday it's the
[1:46:28] fire
[1:46:29] that matters
[1:46:31] it's our nature that matters peter said
[1:46:33] we've been given all these promises
[1:46:36] through jesus christ
[1:46:38] amen
[1:46:39] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[1:46:42] perish but have everlasting life
[1:46:45] amen from the promises to you to your
[1:46:47] children the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:46:49] it's god's precious promise
[1:46:52] the baptism of the holy ghost is god's
[1:46:55] precious promise and it will change your
[1:46:59] nature
[1:47:01] you can try to quit this and you can try
[1:47:03] to quit that you can try all of that you
[1:47:05] want to but you'll never succeed until
[1:47:08] you see god i don't know about all that
[1:47:10] i just want more of your nature
[1:47:13] i need your holy ghost where it's not my
[1:47:15] nature to do that it's not my desire to
[1:47:18] do that
[1:47:20] are you with me listen to everybody
[1:47:23] that's a secret right there i just told
[1:47:25] you a secret
[1:47:26] of entering in
[1:47:28] amen
[1:47:30] and being able to overcome
[1:47:32] the only way with your the only way
[1:47:34] you're going to overcome is being
[1:47:36] partakers of this divine nature it has
[1:47:39] how maybe it has to be your nature
[1:47:43] not something you force yourself to do
[1:47:46] amen
[1:47:47] we've been partakers of the divine
[1:47:50] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:47:52] that is in the world
[1:47:55] through
[1:47:57] lust
[1:48:02] folks
[1:48:03] you think you can climb a little higher
[1:48:05] i think we got to climb a little higher
[1:48:08] we look at what jesus did
[1:48:10] walked on water
[1:48:12] raised lazarus from the dead huh
[1:48:15] we look what jesus did in brother
[1:48:16] banham's ministry 13 people are so
[1:48:19] raised from the dead
[1:48:26] what was it
[1:48:27] when brother branham was over in germany
[1:48:28] i believe it wasn't that little boy that
[1:48:31] vision that he had that he had wrote
[1:48:32] down everybody had wrote down and his
[1:48:34] accident and all of a sudden disappeared
[1:48:37] and he realized that that was that boy
[1:48:39] that they had probably had prophesied
[1:48:40] would raise a bunch of russian soldiers
[1:48:42] and everything else hello that was
[1:48:44] around
[1:48:45] he says man the
[1:48:47] russians were hugging finnish people i
[1:48:49] guess they were really at odds with each
[1:48:51] other hated each other but the russians
[1:48:53] and the different ones says we'll serve
[1:48:55] a god that can raise the dead
[1:48:58] that's what brother brennan's ministry
[1:49:00] was all about is proving that jesus is
[1:49:02] alive to the world
[1:49:04] that's what it was all about he proved
[1:49:06] to the world that god is real
[1:49:09] and then we look at brother branham's
[1:49:10] life and we see him stopping a storm
[1:49:13] creating squirrels speaking to a bull
[1:49:18] huh
[1:49:19] when is it going to be before we have
[1:49:20] testimonies like that here in this
[1:49:22] church
[1:49:27] yes this certain thing it may not be a
[1:49:29] bull or all of that but whatever it is
[1:49:32] you'll be able to come to church and say
[1:49:33] i have a testimony
[1:49:35] i was about to die
[1:49:39] and i prayed and believed the holy
[1:49:41] spirit come down that love came over me
[1:49:43] huh
[1:49:45] and god took care of my situations
[1:49:48] i don't know about you but that's where
[1:49:49] i want to get to
[1:49:51] i want to get to where all things are
[1:49:52] possible and i see the power of god in
[1:49:54] my life like never before

[2:02:48] one more scripture before we close
[2:02:50] matthew
[2:02:58] 22. matthew 22
[2:03:04] brother brandon makes reference to this
[2:03:05] scripture in preaching
[2:03:07] things that are to be when he spoke of
[2:03:09] how that
[2:03:10] how that everything was prepared for us
[2:03:12] when we came here everything will be
[2:03:14] prepared for us when we go over younder
[2:03:16] god is taking care of it all
[2:03:19] he has supplied all these things and
[2:03:21] prepared everything
[2:03:23] and in matthew 22 and verse 4
[2:03:27] he says well let's just go back
[2:03:29] let's read all of this and jesus
[2:03:31] answered and speak unto them again by
[2:03:33] parables and said the kingdom of heaven
[2:03:34] is like a to a certain king which made a
[2:03:36] marriage for his son
[2:03:38] and he sent forth his servants to call
[2:03:40] them that were bitten to the wedding and
[2:03:43] they would not come
[2:03:45] again he sent forth servants saint tell
[2:03:48] them which are been behold
[2:03:50] i have prepared my dinner
[2:03:56] how many means god is prepared jesus has
[2:03:59] a table spread
[2:04:02] where everything you have need of
[2:04:05] can be taken care of
[2:04:07] if you're hungry for whatever it is god
[2:04:09] has that taken care of for you
[2:04:12] my falcon and my battlings are killed
[2:04:16] and all things are
[2:04:19] ready
[2:04:20] praise be to god
[2:04:22] come unto the marriage
[2:04:26] so we know that god calls the whole
[2:04:28] world and says look i've prepared
[2:04:30] everything
[2:04:32] i believe that's what will be said on
[2:04:34] the judgment days i prepared everything
[2:04:37] i gave you everything
[2:04:39] [Applause]
[2:04:40] why did you take it
[2:04:43] they won't have an excuse the world will
[2:04:46] not have an excuse
[2:04:51] i looked somewhere in the news this week
[2:04:55] and
[2:04:58] one of the
[2:05:01] commentators i guess somewhere said you
[2:05:03] know that the new generation of kids
[2:05:05] that don't know jesus
[2:05:07] he says they're making things better for
[2:05:09] us they're gonna be it's gonna be better
[2:05:10] with the kids that don't know jesus
[2:05:12] it's actually a better generation
[2:05:17] brother bad that just almost gets your
[2:05:18] righteous indignation up
[2:05:20] look at the kids look how they kill each
[2:05:23] other look at that you call that better
[2:05:27] that's how blind this world is
[2:05:30] let me tell you something what they need
[2:05:31] is jesus
[2:05:34] they need jesus more than ever that's
[2:05:35] why it's a complete riot out there it's
[2:05:37] because they don't know jesus
[2:05:40] that was a devil talk and if i ever
[2:05:41] heard it isn't that right
[2:05:43] to say that it's a better it's not a
[2:05:44] better generation
[2:05:46] ain't nobody i don't care if it's
[2:05:48] teenagers or older people who it is
[2:05:50] without christ you're not a better
[2:05:51] person
[2:05:53] no not at all
[2:05:56] amen
[2:05:57] i'm so glad
[2:05:58] aren't you glad that you have come to
[2:06:00] his table to eat to come say lord you
[2:06:03] know what i have need of

[2:06:07] about what you have need of this morning

[2:06:12] do you believe god can supply that this
[2:06:14] morning

[2:06:17] the holy ghost
[2:06:19] let me tell you something we shouldn't
[2:06:20] be getting drained of the holy ghost we
[2:06:22] shouldn't be we should be getting more
[2:06:24] full of the holy spirit
[2:06:27] but you can't do it if you spend more
[2:06:30] time on the things of the world and less
[2:06:32] reading and pray
