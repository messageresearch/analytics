[38:54] thank you
[39:19] morning brothers and sisters we'll just
[39:23] stand this morning
[39:26] your brother Joe will take us to prayer
[39:28] this morning
[39:42] forever
[39:58] or if you want to control everything
[40:03] in here
[40:12] [Music]
[40:14] the preaching of the word or that we can
[40:17] leave here better than when we came
[40:21] to this point
[40:29] right at this point
[40:32] my neighbors
[40:40] on each one of us
[40:45] I'm worried about what's our situation
[41:00] did you help
[41:02] him
[41:05] self
[41:15] this week
[41:23] or whatever it is
[41:31] [Applause]
[41:44] or whatever
[41:49] [Music]
[41:59] amen the children can be dismissed for
[42:01] Sunday School
[42:03] we'll go in the scriptures
[42:06] we're gonna go to Proverbs the 13th
[42:08] chapter
[42:17] Proverbs the 13th chapter
[42:23] and I I think we'll read to 1 through 12
[42:26] is what we're going to do proverbs 13.
[42:31] why son here at this father's
[42:33] instruction but a scorner hereth not
[42:35] rebuke
[42:45] he then keepeth his mouth keepeth his
[42:47] life but he that openeth wide is live
[42:49] shall have destruction
[42:58] righteous men hateth lying but a wicked
[43:01] man is loathsome and cometh to shame
[43:05] away
[43:12] there is that maketh there is that
[43:15] maketh himself Rich yet hath nothing
[43:17] there is that make themselves poor yet
[43:20] have great riches
[43:28] the light of the righteous rejoices but
[43:31] the lymph of the wicked shall be put out
[43:40] wealth gotten by Vanity shall be
[43:42] diminished but he that gaareth by labor
[43:44] shall increase
[43:46] hope deferred maketh the heart sick but
[43:50] when the desire cometh it is a tree of
[43:52] life God bless you may be seated brother
[43:54] Brian
[44:07] brothers and sisters
[44:10] I think I said why it's been several
[44:13] years ago but in
[44:15] in the Proverbs if you've read one
[44:17] problem of every day of every month you
[44:20] when you read the Proverbs you think of
[44:22] Solomon what
[44:24] program was four thousand years ago
[44:26] quite not quite but almost 4 000 years
[44:29] ago and the wisdom that he wrote four
[44:31] thousand years ago is the same wisdom
[44:33] for today you know you know brother
[44:36] Branham said to men don't change
[44:39] it they don't change as a man dies that
[44:42] spirit that ever possessed him just
[44:44] moves on to another man or another woman
[44:46] them Spirits have been here for
[44:51] that lascivious spirit
[44:55] they've been here for thousands of years
[44:57] and we all make a choice whether we're
[44:59] going to allow those spirits to possess
[45:01] our hearts and souls or we're going to
[45:02] allow the spirit of Christ to possess
[45:04] our heart and soul and that's that's
[45:06] basically the only difference you know
[45:09] men think there's getting smarter
[45:11] they're getting better but actually
[45:12] they're just getting worse you know I
[45:14] was I was uh reading numerous chapters
[45:17] this morning in my study and
[45:19] and I was reading in Ezekiel the I'm I'm
[45:22] up to almost 30th chapter of Zeke unit
[45:25] thinking how Ezekiel talked about
[45:28] um I already found my point this morning
[45:30] how Ezekiel was talking about the
[45:32] children of Israel and how profane they
[45:35] were and how lost they were but then you
[45:39] you also read where it says in their own
[45:41] minds
[45:42] before they were taken wouldn't he the
[45:44] voice of the Prophet for the day that
[45:46] they lived in and you think of our day
[45:48] and age you know the world that we live
[45:50] in this morning how far off the Mark is
[45:53] the world out there this morning how
[45:55] crazy have they gone you know I I won't
[45:58] even talk about the things they do
[45:59] anymore because it's not edifying to
[46:02] talk about the things you're doing out
[46:04] there in the world anymore but as you
[46:06] get older I know as a young man you
[46:08] would think you know this is what you've
[46:10] been seeing all your life as you get a
[46:13] little older you realize the things that
[46:14] you thought were normal when you were 19
[46:16] now that you're almost seven you never
[46:19] thought that the world would be the way
[46:21] it is this morning but then brother
[46:23] Brown gave us a prophecy saying it ain't
[46:25] going to get any better it's only going
[46:27] to get worse
[46:28] however I prophecy this morning that you
[46:31] know what you see today on Sunday you
[46:35] know 9th of 2023 you can guarantee that
[46:40] of course it's not going to get better
[46:41] so it should let us know as Christians
[46:43] that are hoped this morning is not in
[46:47] the world or in the things that it
[46:49] supplies but in Jesus Christ this
[46:52] morning outside of that there's no hope
[46:54] and I was reading several several
[46:56] chapters this morning
[46:59] um
[46:59] I'll just
[47:01] I'll just go over I was going to read
[47:03] from Romans the first chapter but I'll
[47:05] jump over here
[47:07] if you return with me I read this
[47:09] chapter a lot in the Bible this morning
[47:11] I mean when things seem
[47:15] in your lives this morning sometimes
[47:17] this chapter really can lift you up in
[47:20] the day that we live this morning you
[47:22] have that hope this morning and I was
[47:25] um before I get started it's the fifth
[47:27] chapter of second Corinthians I I didn't
[47:29] tell you what chapter I was looking at
[47:30] but I was reading those things up there
[47:33] this morning that were posted there the
[47:35] quotes from Brother Branham you know and
[47:38] think about
[47:40] being a soldier but the one trait a
[47:43] soldier has to have of course he needs
[47:46] courage uh if you don't have courage you
[47:48] will not be a very good soldier you
[47:50] won't be a very good Christian if you
[47:51] don't have courage but you have to be
[47:54] steadfast if you're going to be a
[47:56] soldier of Christ you have to be
[47:58] steadfast you have to plant Your gran
[48:01] feeding in the ground firmly and not
[48:03] step back you're not going to go
[48:04] backward you're just going to keep
[48:06] pushing forward as God leads you to push
[48:09] forward if you're not steadfast in the
[48:11] age that we're living and you're going
[48:12] to get consumed by all the things that
[48:15] are out there this morning but
[48:18] um this chapter right here in the fifth
[48:20] chapter Corinthians already
[48:22] I say it but I won't say it I was about
[48:25] to say something
[48:26] but you know Paul was talking to the
[48:28] Corinthian Believers we know they were a
[48:30] backslid church they're no different
[48:33] than the church world today they
[48:35] couldn't keep themselves correctly
[48:39] Paul constantly how to correct the
[48:41] Corinthian Church they were constantly
[48:43] doing going in all kinds of excesses but
[48:47] I'll just read what Barbara Paul had to
[48:48] say this morning
[48:50] for we know that if our Earthly House of
[48:53] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[48:55] billion of God a house not made with
[48:58] hands Eternal in the heavens so that's a
[49:00] comforting thought it's not something we
[49:02] do but God's done it for us and this
[49:04] goes back to the 14th chapter of the
[49:07] Gospel of John
[49:09] and he says for in this we groan
[49:11] earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon
[49:13] with our house which is from heaven so
[49:15] the very Christian Spirit should desire
[49:18] to be in your fun off well I'm not going
[49:21] to pronounce
[49:22] you're in your Heavenly Body I'll say it
[49:25] that way I was about to mispronounce
[49:27] that word if so be being clothed we
[49:30] shall not be found naked but we that are
[49:33] in this Tabernacle do groan being
[49:35] burdened not for that which we would be
[49:37] unclothed but close upon that mortality
[49:40] might be swallowed up of life
[49:43] and now he that hath were brought us for
[49:47] the self same thing as God who has given
[49:50] unto us the earnest of the spirit
[49:52] therefore we are always confident
[49:54] knowing that whilst we are
[49:56] home in the body we are absent from the
[49:59] Lord and we all are that way this
[50:01] morning we're absent from the Lord
[50:03] in a physical sense but in a spiritual
[50:05] sense this morning you should not be
[50:07] absent that God should be in your heart
[50:10] this morning you should be a friend to
[50:12] him you should you should be
[50:14] communicating with him your your heart
[50:16] desires should be totally wrapped around
[50:18] him this morning and I lost my place
[50:21] there for we walk by faith and not by
[50:23] sight we are confident and I say living
[50:26] rather to be absent from the body to be
[50:28] present with the Lord
[50:29] wherefore we labor that whether present
[50:32] or or absent we may be accepted of him
[50:36] and I know that's my desire this morning
[50:38] okay on that day that I would be
[50:40] accepted by him and you know you have
[50:43] that isn't
[50:46] hard for you to know if if you've done
[50:49] what God told you to do and that spirit
[50:51] is
[50:53] backing back to you that he's accepted
[50:57] that sacrifice that you gave this
[50:58] morning you have that Eternal help hope
[51:01] this morning that God gives you through
[51:02] the grace in Jesus Christ this morning
[51:04] you shouldn't be questioning it every
[51:06] day of your life whether you're saved or
[51:08] not God wants to give you that
[51:10] experience this morning will you know
[51:11] that you know that God has finished the
[51:13] work in your heart in your life this
[51:16] morning you shouldn't you don't need to
[51:18] be wishy-washy in the age that we live
[51:20] in this morning we are confident I was
[51:23] saying winning rather to be absent from
[51:24] the body to be present with the war Lord
[51:27] wherefore we labor that whether
[51:29] president or absent we may be accepted
[51:31] to him by rereading it again for we must
[51:35] all be fair before the Judgment seat of
[51:37] Christ that everyone may receive the
[51:40] things done in this body the quoting do
[51:42] what he has done whether it be good or
[51:43] bad and brother Bradham talked about
[51:45] this a little bit you know Christians
[51:48] don't go to the white Throne judgment
[51:49] but Christians will be judged on their
[51:52] works by Christ himself and that's what
[51:56] you you can't work your way to heaven
[51:58] but every Christian should the desire to
[52:00] do things for the Lord every day and he
[52:03] goes knowing therefore the terror of the
[52:04] lord we persuade men
[52:06] that we are made manifest on the garden
[52:09] I trust also are made manifest in your
[52:11] own consciousness
[52:13] for we command not ourselves again unto
[52:15] you but give you occasion the glory
[52:18] on our behalf that you may have somewhat
[52:20] to answer them which glory and
[52:22] appearance and not and are
[52:24] for whether we be beside ourselves it is
[52:26] of god or whether we be sober it is for
[52:29] your cause
[52:31] For the Love of Christ constrains us
[52:33] because we thus judge if one died for us
[52:35] all then we are all dead and then I'll
[52:38] just finish reading this and sit down
[52:39] this morning because I'm totally off my
[52:41] point but he goes on to say
[52:43] that he that died for all that which
[52:46] lives should not henceforth live onto
[52:49] themselves but unto him which died for
[52:51] them which rose again and that's a
[52:53] comforting thought you're not living for
[52:55] yourself but you're living for him this
[52:57] morning
[52:58] you know the way I am yeah I could write
[53:01] thousands of notes in my book and I know
[53:04] that when I come up here I won't stay on
[53:06] my notes so I'm one of those persons
[53:09] that comes up here I have a few things
[53:10] wrote down but I'm not one of those guys
[53:12] that can find follow notes therefore If
[53:15] any man be in Christ he is a new
[53:17] creature all things are passed away
[53:18] behold all things have become new
[53:21] and all things are of God who hath
[53:24] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[53:26] that have given us the ministry of
[53:30] reconciliation you know that's a
[53:32] comforting thought I mentioned that
[53:33] earlier a few minutes ago that's the
[53:35] whole purpose of it all that God wants
[53:37] to reconcile himself with you this
[53:40] morning no one here this morning has to
[53:42] be outside of the grace of God it's a
[53:44] free gift for everyone here this morning
[53:46] but you have to choose to reach out and
[53:49] take it this morning
[53:50] to with the God that was in Christ
[53:53] reconcile the world gone to himself not
[53:55] getting their trespasses on to them
[53:58] and hath committed unto us the word of
[54:00] reconciliation
[54:02] now then we are ambassadors of Christ as
[54:05] though God did beseech You by us we pray
[54:08] you in Christ said that you be
[54:10] reconciled to God for he have made him
[54:12] to be sin for us for who knew no sin
[54:15] that we might be made the righteousness
[54:17] of God in him and I was also thinking of
[54:21] some of them quotes talking about being
[54:23] the soldier like I said one of the most
[54:25] important traits of you got to have
[54:27] courage
[54:28] I mean God will give you the courage you
[54:30] need this morning I mean your brother
[54:33] can't give it your sister your parents
[54:35] can't give you courage that's something
[54:36] God Christian God it's not a natural
[54:39] type of but Christian Courage no matter
[54:41] what the world says about you what the
[54:44] world does to you you have courage
[54:46] you're just going to keep putting
[54:47] yourself forward and forward and forward
[54:49] no matter what people tell you not to
[54:52] say that you don't take advice but
[54:54] anything someone tells you about how you
[54:56] should be or what you should do you
[54:58] should take it back to the word of God
[55:00] and the message of the hour and then as
[55:02] you walk forward and be in steadfast in
[55:04] your walk this morning and the way you
[55:06] become steadfast is you learn the word
[55:09] of God and you apply it to your life
[55:10] this morning that's how you steadfast
[55:12] and I was thinking if they're talking
[55:14] about the swords the swords and weapons
[55:17] of war but I will tell you if you're
[55:20] using a sword or a Warhammer or a battle
[55:22] ax then you're in the thick of it this
[55:25] morning and when you're in the thick of
[55:27] it it's not time to question whether you
[55:30] have the ability to fight you just have
[55:32] to fight because if you don't fight you
[55:34] won't make it so as we move on in this
[55:37] year I hope that God blesses you all
[55:39] this morning
[55:40] Brother David

[1:18:08] getting reports every day from a

[1:18:12] right out there in space that's that's
[1:18:14] sending back things that they've never
[1:18:16] seen so they now just heard that they
[1:18:18] now know
[1:18:19] in the what this telescope can see of
[1:18:21] the they've estimated 200 billion
[1:18:25] galaxies out there that they never knew
[1:18:27] it was that vast and that's just what
[1:18:29] they can see with this telescope I had a

[1:18:40] that's just the backdrop for the main
[1:18:41] featured event that they have in their
[1:18:44] in their mural but he said that 200
[1:18:46] billion galaxies he says that's just the
[1:18:49] backdrop that God did for his main
[1:18:52] purpose his main event was he didn't
[1:18:55] want to dwell alone he wanted a family
[1:18:57] and he wanted to share his eternal life
[1:19:00] with his children all those really when
[1:19:02] you think of that that's just all that
[1:19:04] God did it's a backdrop for the main
[1:19:07] thing he wanted a family
[1:19:09] and that's us

[1:35:52] morning I want to minister on something
[1:35:53] that I've had on my heart amen for two
[1:35:55] or three weeks I guess I've had it I
[1:35:58] mean uh kind of on the back burner just
[1:36:00] brewing so to speak and waiting on the
[1:36:02] Lord amen to amen give me the auction to
[1:36:05] speak it amen and I felt that uh
[1:36:08] yesterday I felt to go in the direction
[1:36:10] that I want to go amen and I uh uh I'll
[1:36:14] probably title it something different
[1:36:15] but we'll call it supporting the local
[1:36:18] body amen praise the Lord
[1:36:21] so God bless you this morning if you
[1:36:23] will we'll just bow our heads and talk
[1:36:25] to the author of the book before we read
[1:36:27] his book lord Jesus we come before you
[1:36:29] now Lord and your Prophet is taught that
[1:36:31] any man can open these open the Bible
[1:36:33] but God it does take you to give us the
[1:36:35] interpretation to give us the
[1:36:37] inspiration from the understanding from
[1:36:40] it Lord we know that it has to be given
[1:36:42] by your spirit according to your word no
[1:36:45] man knows the things of man saved the
[1:36:46] spirit of man and neither does anybody
[1:36:49] know the things of God save the spirit
[1:36:51] of God and Lord we ask God that just
[1:36:53] bless their meditation of our heart the
[1:36:55] reading of the word are assembling
[1:36:57] together Lord and most of all we believe
[1:36:59] God that you'll come and do exceedingly
[1:37:02] abundantly above all that we could ask
[1:37:03] or think Lord Jesus and I ask also that
[1:37:06] you would just be with those streaming
[1:37:08] this morning for those who couldn't be
[1:37:10] here Lord for some reason Lord we ask
[1:37:12] God you bless them also as they listen
[1:37:14] this morning Father we love you Lord and
[1:37:17] we commit this service to you not
[1:37:18] ourself for your service in Jesus
[1:37:21] Christ's name amen and amen praise the
[1:37:24] Lord if you will amen I would like to
[1:37:27] open up our Bibles this morning and Amy
[1:37:30] and I uh
[1:37:33] have quite a few different things that
[1:37:35] aspects of this that I'd like to share
[1:37:37] and amen so if it's just a little long
[1:37:40] bear with me would you amen
[1:37:43] but I'm trust I know that it'll be a
[1:37:46] blessing to you amen because he
[1:37:47] certainly was to me in any time you read
[1:37:49] God's word it's always a blessing isn't
[1:37:51] that right
[1:37:52] amen so I think we'll turn to
[1:37:56] First Corinthians 11 or First
[1:37:58] Corinthians 12 and we'll start with just
[1:38:01] one word and then I want scripture and
[1:38:03] then we'll let you be seated as we try
[1:38:05] to try to put together amen with the
[1:38:08] help of the Lord amen
[1:38:10] the thoughts from this scripture
[1:38:13] First Corinthians
[1:38:16] and do want to announce that Lord
[1:38:18] willing I'll be going up to do more
[1:38:20] missionary work in Ohio Tuesday morning
[1:38:23] will be gone most of the week whether
[1:38:25] Danny will be ministering this coming
[1:38:27] Wednesday so pray for him amen
[1:38:29] amen and so pray for us up there we just
[1:38:33] want to go up there and see what the
[1:38:34] Lord will help help us to be able to do
[1:38:36] amen I remember I think it was brother
[1:38:38] Billy Laster a long time ago mentioned
[1:38:41] and said that brother Branham had said
[1:38:43] that you can never go wrong doing
[1:38:45] missionary work amen
[1:38:47] amen and so we should do missionary work
[1:38:49] wherever we are praise the Lord so First
[1:38:52] Corinthians will go with chapter 12 and
[1:38:56] verse 27. now ye are the body of Christ
[1:39:00] and members in particular may God that
[1:39:03] is blessings to the reading of the word
[1:39:05] you can be seed amen seated amen I want
[1:39:08] to talk about the body of Christ the
[1:39:11] body of Christ
[1:39:13] amen
[1:39:14] praise the Lord
[1:39:16] Hallelujah and when I get when I begin
[1:39:19] to think about this and you know this is
[1:39:21] just something I feel like the Lord's
[1:39:23] kind of quickened to me and that is you
[1:39:25] know the body of Christ you know of
[1:39:28] course is the body that he's living in
[1:39:31] now compared to when he was here on
[1:39:33] Earth we know that he was in a Corporal
[1:39:36] physical body isn't that right he had
[1:39:38] his own body and all of the fullness of
[1:39:41] God dwelled in Jesus
[1:39:44] amen so that was God's body at that time
[1:39:48] amen
[1:39:50] and so uh I think when I think of the
[1:39:53] body of Christ I think of the family I
[1:39:55] think it'll be family amen
[1:39:57] and how that in order to be part of that
[1:40:00] family amen uh you have to be your DNA
[1:40:04] has to match with your mom and dad isn't
[1:40:06] that right
[1:40:07] to be a part of the family you can't
[1:40:09] join it our Prophet taught us that you
[1:40:11] know we don't join the Church of God we
[1:40:13] don't join Christ amen no you have to be
[1:40:17] borned into it amen and that's the way
[1:40:20] it is with a family you've got to be
[1:40:21] born into a family a man you have and
[1:40:24] they can take DNA tests and they can
[1:40:26] find out that you know just who your
[1:40:29] father was your mama was and many times
[1:40:31] nowadays you know uh sad to say but a
[1:40:34] lot of times fathers will do or have a
[1:40:38] DNA test done on their child to find out
[1:40:41] whether that child is really his or not
[1:40:43] I mean he knows a lot of times they come
[1:40:45] to find out there's great disappointment
[1:40:47] when they find out hey that child does
[1:40:49] not have your DNA it's not your child
[1:40:53] and of course that would rip the heart
[1:40:55] of the bed out knowing perhaps that his
[1:40:58] woman and his wife or whatever amen was
[1:41:00] unfaithful isn't that right amen and
[1:41:03] praise the Lord aren't you glad that you
[1:41:05] and I have a way of taking a DNA test
[1:41:09] how many beliefs that we have to have
[1:41:12] with the help of God you've got to have
[1:41:14] and I've got to have a DNA test
[1:41:17] something that makes absolutely ties you
[1:41:20] in amen with your heavenly father amen
[1:41:24] that makes you a part of God in Romans 8
[1:41:27] and verse 9 is our of course our DNA
[1:41:30] test to find out if you're really one of
[1:41:32] gods or if you're his son or if you're
[1:41:35] not
[1:41:36] amen it says it this way if I can just
[1:41:39] find it here 8 and verse 9 he says but
[1:41:42] ye are not in the flesh he says but in
[1:41:46] the spirit if so be that the spirit of
[1:41:50] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[1:41:54] the spirit of God
[1:41:56] he is
[1:41:58] none of his amen so I may know that amen
[1:42:03] I believe over in uh Corinthians also
[1:42:05] there's another DNA test basically amen
[1:42:08] here uh
[1:42:11] another another way to test to see if
[1:42:14] you're really a part of God's program it
[1:42:16] says in chapter
[1:42:18] 12 and verse 13 it says four by one
[1:42:23] Spirit are we all baptized into
[1:42:27] one body
[1:42:30] amen so we know that it's not my
[1:42:33] handshake it's not by putting our name
[1:42:35] on the book isn't that right but it's by
[1:42:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost not many
[1:42:40] knows that that's exactly amen a part of
[1:42:43] God it is God himself
[1:42:46] dwelling in you when that Holy Spirit
[1:42:49] comes into your soul
[1:42:51] praise the Lord and that's the only way
[1:42:53] that you could ever become part of the
[1:42:56] body of Christ is to have his spirit
[1:43:03] amen I like that don't you aren't you
[1:43:06] glad we had a Prophet come and
[1:43:08] straighten out how you joined Church
[1:43:11] how do you come apart to become part of
[1:43:14] Christ because every church and so forth
[1:43:16] amen has its own way it has its own math
[1:43:19] it has its own uh belief of how you come
[1:43:23] and be a part of the body or uh or a
[1:43:27] part of Christ amen and we do realize
[1:43:29] that there is a local body and then
[1:43:31] there's of course and that local body is
[1:43:33] supposed to be a body of Believers isn't
[1:43:37] that right now we're taught there's
[1:43:38] three kinds of Believers but that's the
[1:43:40] local Body of Christ amen in every
[1:43:42] church and every a community rather
[1:43:45] brand them of course just you know
[1:43:46] questions and answers he says a whole
[1:43:48] lot amen about the local body and how
[1:43:51] it's supposed to be set up and so forth
[1:43:53] amen
[1:43:54] but praise the Lord I got to thinking
[1:43:56] about the body of Christ amen and now he
[1:43:59] knows that uh you know we're a
[1:44:01] privileged people today to know that if
[1:44:04] we could have been in the days of Jesus
[1:44:07] and if we could have been a woman with
[1:44:09] that blood of the issue of blood and
[1:44:12] tried to you know all the Physicians and
[1:44:14] spend all she had but amen just to be
[1:44:17] able to come up and Touch the Hem of His
[1:44:20] Garment
[1:44:21] isn't that right when she just touched
[1:44:23] the Hem of His Garment she was made oh
[1:44:28] praise the Lord how many knows others
[1:44:30] later on come to find out people won't
[1:44:32] just get into shadow of Peter amen and
[1:44:35] be healed
[1:44:36] so how many believe there's power in the
[1:44:39] body of Christ
[1:44:40] amen
[1:44:42] amen and so there's a lot of different
[1:44:44] things I want to try to bring and one of
[1:44:46] them of course amen is how that we treat
[1:44:48] one another in that body and be a part
[1:44:51] of that body of Christ amen I believe in
[1:44:55] the 17th chapter of Saint John Jesus
[1:44:58] said now I am no more in the world but
[1:45:01] these are in the world and I come unto
[1:45:03] thee Holy Father keep through thy own
[1:45:06] name Those whom thou has given me that
[1:45:10] they now know what is talking about that
[1:45:12] they may be one as we are one amen so
[1:45:17] let me know if it was Christ's desire
[1:45:18] many times you talked about this as I
[1:45:21] was is that those that are in that body
[1:45:24] that they would be one
[1:45:27] amen
[1:45:29] Hallelujah
[1:45:31] Hallelujah
[1:45:33] and you know whenever you're born into a
[1:45:35] family whenever you're born into a
[1:45:36] family we know that uh it's
[1:45:40] it's the order of God it's God's order
[1:45:42] is to be to have families to have a
[1:45:45] father to have a mother to have a man
[1:45:47] and a woman to come together and holy
[1:45:49] matrimony and bring forth children into
[1:45:51] the world and amen and to raise them and
[1:45:54] we find that in those in those families
[1:45:57] many times every one of our families
[1:45:58] those children their flesh of your flesh
[1:46:01] their bone of your bone their blood of
[1:46:02] your blood
[1:46:04] amen and so uh you know that family is
[1:46:07] is uh you know we say that nothing runs
[1:46:11] sicker than blood
[1:46:12] amen some people who want to stick up
[1:46:14] for their family no matter what and this
[1:46:16] that or the other and you know we're
[1:46:18] supposed to love one another one another
[1:46:19] no matter what isn't that right now we
[1:46:22] never we never stick up for each other's
[1:46:24] wrong
[1:46:25] amen we never never do that if you do
[1:46:28] that well you love your family more than
[1:46:30] you love Christ amen but you know we we
[1:46:34] have to learn to love on one another and
[1:46:37] we find out there's one thing about
[1:46:39] children is that they are all different
[1:46:44] we call it diversity isn't that right
[1:46:46] there's some so much diversity in one
[1:46:49] family amen you'll have the rambunctious
[1:46:51] one
[1:46:53] amen you'll have the outspoken one
[1:46:55] you'll have to silent The Quiet One you
[1:46:58] know and you'll have the sensitive one
[1:47:00] and you'll have the in unsensitive one
[1:47:02] and and all different personalities
[1:47:04] comes in a family and that's the way it
[1:47:07] is in the body in the body of Christ
[1:47:10] and he believes it's a whole lot of
[1:47:12] diversity that goes on God didn't make
[1:47:14] us all the same he didn't make us to
[1:47:15] look the same according to the prophet
[1:47:17] redheads blonde hair and all these
[1:47:19] different things different characters
[1:47:20] amen and sometimes those characters even
[1:47:22] you got to watch it it takes a lot of
[1:47:24] the Holy Ghost sometimes for you me to
[1:47:27] meet up with the person whose
[1:47:28] personality you clash with
[1:47:31] amen you just thought you your
[1:47:33] personalities just to kind of clash and
[1:47:35] you got to have a whole lot of the Holy
[1:47:36] Ghost ain't meant to be able to overlook
[1:47:38] that and to look past that and realize
[1:47:40] that you are brothers and sisters amen
[1:47:43] and I you feel to say this but I want
[1:47:46] you to understand that you're becoming a
[1:47:49] member of the second family on earth a
[1:47:51] priest uh what do you call precedes or
[1:47:54] or trumps your first family
[1:47:59] amen
[1:48:00] that's right because that second family
[1:48:03] is your Eternal family your natural
[1:48:06] family that's just your temporal family
[1:48:08] amen praise the Lord and we appreciate
[1:48:11] our families we should always love one
[1:48:13] another but remember this that there's a
[1:48:15] second birth there's a second family
[1:48:17] that takes place through Jesus Christ
[1:48:19] Our Lord amen and I'll tell you what
[1:48:22] like the prophet says he was a Branham
[1:48:24] I'm a buyer I never had to join the
[1:48:26] bylers and I wouldn't care how much my
[1:48:29] family tried to disown me I'd still get
[1:48:32] up in their face and say look I still
[1:48:34] got bottle of blood running through me
[1:48:36] all right whether you like me or whether
[1:48:38] you don't or whatever it is Amanda you
[1:48:40] might try to dis only but you're still
[1:48:42] my brother you're still my sister all
[1:48:44] right
[1:48:46] I'll tell you what maybe I'm just
[1:48:48] anxious that's one you know but anyway
[1:48:50] you know I just said you know that's
[1:48:51] your family you know and I believe in
[1:48:53] family family I believe you ought to
[1:48:55] stick together no matter what
[1:48:57] praise the Lord
[1:48:58] amen and love one another praise the
[1:49:01] Lord but you know our the name of our
[1:49:04] second anybody know the name of the
[1:49:05] second family that you joined not joined
[1:49:08] but born into
[1:49:09] amen the Lord Jesus Christ Family
[1:49:12] I miss that to be part of the family of
[1:49:15] the Lord Jesus Christ amen because guess
[1:49:18] what when we all got baptized hopefully
[1:49:21] you got baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:49:23] Jesus Christ amen you received his
[1:49:26] spirit
[1:49:28] first be to God bitten better man say
[1:49:31] that you are if you are a son and
[1:49:33] daughter of God you are a seed Gene of
[1:49:37] almighty God in other words you carry
[1:49:39] the genetics of the man and that made
[1:49:43] knows how many billion galaxies our
[1:49:45] brother was talking about you carry that
[1:49:47] Gene and you have a characteristic of
[1:49:50] that Gene and I'm here to tell you this
[1:49:52] morning that that's what we come to
[1:49:54] church for is to find out who we are
[1:49:56] what we are and they become better at
[1:49:59] what we are to understand who we are in
[1:50:01] the greater measure
[1:50:03] and to act like our heavenly father does
[1:50:07] praise be to God
[1:50:10] oh my
[1:50:13] praise be to God
[1:50:15] and you know I was just thinking you
[1:50:17] know God is all that God was he poured
[1:50:19] into Christ and all that Christ was what
[1:50:22] was it I forget the in morphe or
[1:50:25] something like that our Prophet talked
[1:50:27] about who she needs to empty yourself
[1:50:28] out Amen to empty himself out God
[1:50:31] emptied himself into Christ amen he was
[1:50:34] the fullness of Christ and when Christ
[1:50:35] went up into Glory he went back to the
[1:50:38] spirit that he was before he became his
[1:50:41] son amen and then he did well unto them
[1:50:43] Pentecost got emptied
[1:50:46] emptied himself out into a
[1:50:52] how we would have like I said a while
[1:50:54] ago how we would have loved to Touch the
[1:50:56] Hem of His Garment how we would have
[1:50:57] liked to be then or do like John
[1:50:59] prepared to their head on this on his
[1:51:01] chest and just hug him just be up close
[1:51:03] to him amen but let me tell you God
[1:51:05] still has a body that he dwells in
[1:51:11] God has a body and that body is you that
[1:51:15] body is me
[1:51:18] foreign
[1:51:23] oh man aren't you glad for that
[1:51:26] oh my let's just go into a little bit
[1:51:28] different thought here now
[1:51:33] and it's found in
[1:51:36] verse 28 if you have your Bibles and
[1:51:38] want to follow me you can First
[1:51:40] Corinthians 12
[1:51:43] and we'll begin with verse 12.
[1:51:46] for as the body is one and hath many
[1:51:49] members
[1:51:50] and all the members of that body that
[1:51:53] one body being many
[1:51:55] are one body so also is Christ
[1:52:00] for by one Spirit are we all baptized
[1:52:02] into one body whether we be Jews or
[1:52:06] Gentiles whether it be Bond or free
[1:52:09] whether we're black or white or red
[1:52:13] ah or yellow it don't matter yellow
[1:52:16] black blue and white they're all
[1:52:18] precious in this site I mean please all
[1:52:21] Races all it don't matter when you're in
[1:52:23] that body it makes you a brother it
[1:52:25] makes you a sister
[1:52:27] whether you're Bond whether you're free
[1:52:29] and haven't been all made to drink into
[1:52:32] drink into one spirit
[1:52:35] for the body is not one member but many
[1:52:39] amen and if the foot shall say because
[1:52:41] on the other hand I'm not the body is it
[1:52:44] therefore none of the body
[1:52:46] amen now we're not going to go through
[1:52:48] all of this it I I don't have time to go
[1:52:50] through it all but if you know the eye
[1:52:52] and the hand and everything and in this
[1:52:54] body amen there's all different members
[1:52:58] praise be to God all right and so he
[1:53:01] talks about you could talk about our
[1:53:03] Natural Body you can bring in this
[1:53:04] Natural Body talking and type it in
[1:53:07] here because he talks about fingers he
[1:53:09] talks about hands he talks about the
[1:53:11] head amen it's just because you're not a
[1:53:13] trustee just because you're not the song
[1:53:15] leader just because you're not the
[1:53:16] preacher that doesn't mean you're not
[1:53:18] nobody
[1:53:20] Amen Let me just convey this real
[1:53:21] heavily there's no big eyes and little
[1:53:24] use
[1:53:25] amen because I'll tell you what right
[1:53:27] now Jesus said if you give a cup of cold
[1:53:30] water to the least of these little ones
[1:53:31] you will not lose your reward he cares
[1:53:34] about each and every person that is in
[1:53:37] Christ
[1:53:39] amen so where Paul is making a point he
[1:53:42] says you know amen everybody I'll tell
[1:53:45] you what every part of the body is
[1:53:48] important hey man
[1:53:51] let me just say this comes to mind
[1:53:53] because I wanted to say it as I brought
[1:53:54] it into the local body in the local body
[1:53:56] of course I'm the head amen under Christ
[1:53:58] I'm the head of the church here voted in
[1:54:00] by y'all as being the pastor amen and so
[1:54:03] whenever a member listen if a member if
[1:54:06] a church if if somebody quits church do
[1:54:08] you realize it feels like somebody just
[1:54:10] cut off your thumb
[1:54:12] just cut off a fear because if they're
[1:54:14] apart you're supposed to be a part of
[1:54:16] the member it ought to hurt every one of
[1:54:18] us when somebody quits Church
[1:54:21] amen where they at they're gone
[1:54:26] so you see how I passed or you know
[1:54:29] after a while you just kind of get numb
[1:54:31] from losing fingers and hands
[1:54:34] yeah yeah because I don't care what
[1:54:36] church it is people's coming going all
[1:54:37] the time it seems like you know but I'll
[1:54:40] tell you what if it's because of the
[1:54:41] devil it's not a good thing amen not a
[1:54:44] good thing when the devil takes people
[1:54:45] out amen we're a part of each other and
[1:54:48] I want to focus on that with the help of
[1:54:49] the Lord today we want to understand
[1:54:51] each other because I want you to
[1:54:53] understand that a local body of
[1:54:54] Believers like this with with our
[1:54:56] musicians with our specials and and the
[1:54:59] atmosphere of the Lord and and just you
[1:55:01] sitting together there being together
[1:55:03] and the devil don't like it
[1:55:06] he doesn't like it one bit just like the
[1:55:09] devil doesn't like families look what
[1:55:11] he's doing with them I mean if the devil
[1:55:13] doesn't like marriages look at what he's
[1:55:15] doing with them
[1:55:16] somehow or another let me tell you
[1:55:18] something if you have a marriage that's
[1:55:19] sticking together it's because you have
[1:55:21] overcome things isn't that you've
[1:55:24] overcome Temptations of splitting up
[1:55:26] you've overcome many hard things that
[1:55:28] you've went through to where you know
[1:55:30] you almost might don't know if you can
[1:55:32] do it anymore amen you have to realize
[1:55:34] hey I'm married I ain't going nowhere
[1:55:37] huh and you have to overcome and you got
[1:55:39] to work through it that's why you have
[1:55:41] marriages that's why so many of them
[1:55:43] don't because the devil gets in there
[1:55:44] and when you've got a local body any
[1:55:46] local church like this I mean it is a
[1:55:48] real blessing
[1:55:49] it's a real blessing to be able to come
[1:55:51] to church hear music be sues hear the
[1:55:54] word preaching of the word being fed
[1:55:56] spiritually amen strength in your
[1:55:58] relationship amen your personal
[1:56:00] relationship with God and then your
[1:56:02] marital relation be strengthened your
[1:56:04] family be strengthened your children be
[1:56:07] taught
[1:56:09] amen it's just a real blessing and the
[1:56:12] devil don't like another thing I noticed
[1:56:14] that I didn't bring out a while ago
[1:56:15] brings back to my mind Hey man is
[1:56:18] there's another DNA test that you can
[1:56:20] take he says now no chasing Seamus to be
[1:56:23] joyous and depressing but if we are
[1:56:24] without chastise but the Bible says then
[1:56:27] we are bastards and not Sons so if we go
[1:56:30] take remember if a person does not take
[1:56:33] correction from the pope but they're not
[1:56:35] sons of God
[1:56:46] just tried to straighten it out they
[1:56:47] wouldn't they bring it for the church
[1:56:49] remember if they will not take
[1:56:50] correction they're not gods
[1:56:55] DNA find out whether you really have
[1:56:57] gone
[1:56:58] whether you can be corrected
[1:57:00] the chastise chasing
[1:57:03] amen
[1:57:04] praise the Lord so we look at that
[1:57:07] amen
[1:57:13] let's go to Matthew
[1:57:16] 18 Matthew 18.
[1:57:20] foreign
[1:57:30] about something that Paul said and Jesus
[1:57:34] said over in uh
[1:57:36] and that is how that we treat one
[1:57:38] another how we treat people that are in
[1:57:40] the body okay
[1:57:43] the first step you're talking about how
[1:57:45] we treat one another
[1:57:48] I believe one place brother man says you
[1:57:50] know as we serve one another we serve
[1:57:52] God
[1:57:54] is that right now talk about offenses
[1:57:56] for just a minute Matthew 18 and verse 5
[1:57:58] is this and whosoever shall receive such
[1:58:01] a little child in my name receiveth me
[1:58:03] and whosoever shall offend one of these
[1:58:06] little ones which believe in me it were
[1:58:09] better for him than a millstone were
[1:58:11] hanged about his neck and that he were
[1:58:12] drowned in the depths of the sea I asked
[1:58:15] Siri how heavy a will Stone was and it
[1:58:18] said that a millstone varies anywhere
[1:58:20] from a hundred to a thousand pounds so
[1:58:22] let's just take about halfway there you
[1:58:25] are out in the middle of the ocean
[1:58:27] deepest part the depth of the sea amen
[1:58:30] and you got about a 500 pound Millstone
[1:58:32] imagine that you see they would hang
[1:58:34] that hang you by the neck and throw you
[1:58:37] overboard with that 500 Stone pound
[1:58:39] stone and you would be drowned into the
[1:58:41] depth of the sea that's what Jesus how
[1:58:43] he feels about somebody affect ending
[1:58:46] one of his children
[1:58:49] wow
[1:58:51] wow
[1:58:51] doesn't the Bible say another placement
[1:58:54] he says he says touch not mine and not
[1:58:56] anointed and do my prophets no harm
[1:59:01] God feels the same way about his
[1:59:03] littleness of his children that if you
[1:59:05] do if you do the wrong thing if you say
[1:59:07] the wrong thing
[1:59:10] don't defend one of my children
[1:59:14] be better for you to be drowned in the
[1:59:15] lips of sea so how many believes we
[1:59:17] ought to be careful we do
[1:59:20] Paul said for this for this reason many
[1:59:23] are sickly and sleep among you for we do
[1:59:26] not discern the Lord's body
[1:59:29] but the bad come and says you know
[1:59:31] people don't discern the body of the
[1:59:33] Lord and we mistreat one another
[1:59:36] we do things wrong and end up dead
[1:59:44] it's pretty serious thing isn't it how
[1:59:46] many believes it's important
[1:59:50] because how many knows that Jesus Christ
[1:59:52] wants his body one thinking is one
[1:59:55] together loving each other
[1:59:58] just like a dad does his family a mom
[2:00:01] does his family they do anything to try
[2:00:03] to keep that family together
[2:00:06] amen
[2:00:07] to keep them loving one another running
[2:00:09] in unity how wonderful that is amen and
[2:00:14] especially in the house of God God wants
[2:00:16] everybody together amen I believe it was
[2:00:19] Paul says you know I hear that there's a
[2:00:21] divisions among you and I can't hardly
[2:00:23] believe it
[2:00:24] is Christ divided and so forth
[2:00:27] amen because God fight himself or the
[2:00:30] devil there's nothing more than the
[2:00:31] devil likes is to set this unity in a
[2:00:33] group of people
[2:00:37] amen
[2:00:40] you got to have Unity you got to be one
[2:00:44] you're part of the body of Christ
[2:00:46] amen
[2:00:48] amen
[2:00:50] for this many are sickly in many sleep
[2:00:52] for we do not discern the Lord's body
[2:00:56] amen
[2:00:57] remember over in Matthew 25 when the
[2:01:01] Judgment the great the Judgment Day
[2:01:02] comes he says you'll separate the sheep
[2:01:05] from the goats amen he says now and
[2:01:07] every time he mentions he says as you
[2:01:09] have done unto the least of these my
[2:01:12] brethren you have done it unto me how
[2:01:15] many believes as you do to each other
[2:01:16] what you say about each other you say
[2:01:20] about Christ
[2:01:24] amen
[2:01:26] how many beliefs we need to oh my what's
[2:01:29] it going to be on that day
[2:01:31] amen
[2:01:32] well and it goes back to showing us so
[2:01:35] much that if you can't say something
[2:01:37] good
[2:01:40] you don't say anything at all amen why
[2:01:43] amen that's right Discerning the Lord's
[2:01:47] body a millstone were hung about your
[2:01:51] neck
[2:01:52] but if you know on the other hand if you
[2:01:54] give a cup of cold water to one of these
[2:01:57] you will not lose your reward that's why
[2:01:59] amongst Believers we do anything that we
[2:02:01] can for each other don't we anything we
[2:02:04] can do for each other we do now I know
[2:02:07] people like to do things for preachers
[2:02:08] easy preachers so do it again you ought
[2:02:10] to do that for every son and daughter of
[2:02:12] God each and every one of us ought to do
[2:02:15] what we can amen for each other because
[2:02:18] we're part of that body of Christ
[2:02:20] amen
[2:02:22] oh praise the Lord
[2:02:26] you know something else
[2:02:29] um and I wanted to bring prayer into
[2:02:31] this
[2:02:31] amen because there's things in amen that
[2:02:34] the devil wants to do and tries to do
[2:02:37] amen and you know and that is get us to
[2:02:40] be prickly so to speak
[2:02:43] remember where brother bam says when
[2:02:45] you're not around water not around the
[2:02:46] right kind of preacher whether in this
[2:02:47] morning listen this morning is going to
[2:02:49] be certainly a passionate type of
[2:02:50] preaching and it's going to be something
[2:02:52] that is to keep the church clean how
[2:02:54] many believe that
[2:02:55] we want to keep the church clean keep
[2:02:59] the devil out
[2:03:02] I think we preacher uh not so long ago
[2:03:05] talking about making the devil rendering
[2:03:07] him powerless by not allowing him to get
[2:03:10] into your mind your senses your reason
[2:03:12] your conscience but if you guard all of
[2:03:15] those places you'll make it where he
[2:03:16] can't touch you
[2:03:18] but he uses your senses your feelings
[2:03:20] your memory and all those things amen
[2:03:22] and try to get in it to have a place to
[2:03:24] enter in
[2:03:26] and you know and the one thing that
[2:03:28] Jesus says
[2:03:30] all men know that you're my disciples if
[2:03:34] you have loved one for another he said
[2:03:35] one place he says a new commandment I
[2:03:37] give you that you love one another
[2:03:41] oh my
[2:03:43] I I'm getting a little mixed up because
[2:03:45] I really wanted to get into where talks
[2:03:47] about our diversities he says you know
[2:03:49] he gave that body helps and miracles and
[2:03:52] and all of these things all of these
[2:03:54] things he gives us he gives us gifts to
[2:03:56] benefit the church how many believe that
[2:03:58] he gives us everybody he gives everybody
[2:04:01] something you're something
[2:04:03] you do something for the body of Christ
[2:04:06] God didn't just he he didn't just save
[2:04:09] you to be no part you are part of the
[2:04:12] body if you're part of the body then you
[2:04:14] have something to do Amen to edify and
[2:04:17] to bless that body
[2:04:19] let me let me go down that road for a
[2:04:21] little pick up we'll pick up the love
[2:04:22] and the and the prayers in a minute amen
[2:04:25] but I want to go to if you will go to
[2:04:27] Ephesians with me
[2:04:30] the book of Ephesians
[2:04:38] Ephesians 4 and we're going to take our
[2:04:41] time here
[2:04:43] on this one
[2:04:44] Paul's saying I therefore chapter four
[2:04:47] of Ephesians
[2:04:49] I therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[2:04:50] beseech you that what that you are
[2:04:52] worthy of the vocation wherewith you are
[2:04:54] called with all loneliness and meekness
[2:04:58] with long-suffering
[2:05:00] forbearing one another putting up with
[2:05:03] each other in love endeavoring to keep
[2:05:07] the unity of the spirit in the bond of
[2:05:09] peace praise be to God for there is one
[2:05:14] body amen
[2:05:16] and one spirit
[2:05:19] I'm gonna stop right there folks I'm
[2:05:21] here to tell you the reason you have
[2:05:22] divisions is because there's two spirits
[2:05:24] right
[2:05:26] if you've got the same Spirit you all
[2:05:28] know that you can get along with
[2:05:29] somebody got the same Spirit again
[2:05:32] birds of a feather flocked together
[2:05:35] amen but if it's a wrong spirit
[2:05:38] amen
[2:05:40] there's one Spirit even as you are
[2:05:42] called in one hope of your calling
[2:05:44] there's one Lord One Faith one baptism
[2:05:48] how many just one body
[2:05:50] one God and Father of all who is above
[2:05:53] all and through all and in you all
[2:05:57] but until every one of us give is giving
[2:06:00] Grace according to the measure of the
[2:06:01] gift of Christ wherefore he says when he
[2:06:04] ascended up on high he let captivity
[2:06:06] captive and gave gifts unto man
[2:06:10] now notice verse 11 he gave some
[2:06:12] Apostles and Prophets and
[2:06:15] evangelists pastors teachers now we know
[2:06:19] that he also over in uh we haven't read
[2:06:22] it but over in Corinthians the 12th
[2:06:24] chapter he talks about this diversity of
[2:06:26] gifts isn't that right
[2:06:28] he said some in the church prophets
[2:06:30] teachers miracle workers uh Gifts of
[2:06:33] healing helps government diversity of
[2:06:35] thongs and so forth are all Apostles are
[2:06:38] all prophets are all teachers our old
[2:06:41] workers of Miracles basically what he's
[2:06:43] saying is no
[2:06:45] right
[2:06:46] he said are they all is everybody one
[2:06:48] thing no no not everybody's one thing
[2:06:52] amen
[2:06:53] have all the gifts of healing do all
[2:06:55] speak with tongues huh like the
[2:06:58] Pentecostal said everybody got Talking
[2:06:59] Tom no at all speaking tongues it just
[2:07:01] depends you all interpret and so forth
[2:07:03] so you see how this is also not just
[2:07:05] Apostles and Prophets and so forth but
[2:07:07] all these other things for the
[2:07:09] Perfection of the Saints for the work of
[2:07:12] the ministry for the edifying of the
[2:07:15] body of Christ
[2:07:17] praise be to God aren't you glad that
[2:07:19] that's what it does oh my how many has
[2:07:23] eaten without hands
[2:07:26] can you imagine if you didn't have hands
[2:07:28] to feed yourself you'd have to go
[2:07:31] eat out of a bowl
[2:07:33] no arms no hands you have to go down
[2:07:35] there and eat but thank me to God
[2:07:37] every you have a part Amen in every part
[2:07:40] of that body edifies or feeds or makes
[2:07:43] so that you're healthy
[2:07:45] if I forth God we've never said but you
[2:07:48] get carpal tunnel one time and now
[2:07:50] you'll still thank God for good good
[2:07:52] hands
[2:07:54] huh uh get get tennis elbow one time
[2:07:57] you'll be glad when you can go like that
[2:07:59] again
[2:08:00] huh but edit for every part it's the
[2:08:03] edify the body of Christ
[2:08:05] how many beliefs that's what we're here
[2:08:07] for
[2:08:07] and this morning I just want to say
[2:08:12] I'll tell you in a minute
[2:08:14] I want to say I'll tell you in a minute
[2:08:16] hopefully I won't forget
[2:08:18] now notice for the perfecting of the
[2:08:21] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[2:08:22] the edifying of the body of Christ to
[2:08:25] all should we all come into the unity of
[2:08:27] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[2:08:28] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[2:08:31] measure of the stature of the fullness
[2:08:33] of Christ
[2:08:35] praise the Lord that we henceforth be no
[2:08:37] more children tossed to and fraud cared
[2:08:39] about with every window darkened by the
[2:08:41] slide of man and coming craft in this
[2:08:42] bar whereby they lie and wait to deceive
[2:08:45] but speaking the truth in love that we
[2:08:48] may grow up into him in all things which
[2:08:52] is the head even Christ
[2:08:55] how many beliefs that we have ahead that
[2:08:58] head is Christ

[2:09:03] wasn't going to tell you a minute ago
[2:09:04] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[2:09:10] together and compacted by that which

[2:09:18] talking about the body he even talks
[2:09:19] about your joints

[2:10:22] and it does something to edify the body
[2:10:24] of Christ listen
[2:10:26] every joint supplier a Sunday school a
[2:10:29] lot of times we just don't never
[2:10:30] appreciate things do we I don't
[2:10:33] oh my
[2:10:35] God you know we're living in a selfish
[2:10:37] age aren't we
[2:10:38] we're living in a selfish age and I
[2:10:40] don't know about you but it wants to rub
[2:10:42] off on me
[2:10:43] I have to work at not being selfish
[2:10:47] huh
[2:10:49] do you have to work at not being selfish
[2:10:51] if you don't think you're selfish take a
[2:10:53] little harder look
[2:10:55] take a little harder look because it's
[2:10:57] hard to see how selfish we are
[2:11:00] but we're living in the age of self how
[2:11:02] many knows that then I say men will be
[2:11:04] lovers of themselves
[2:11:06] everybody when he comes right doing time
[2:11:08] most of the time we just think about
[2:11:10] ourselves
[2:11:13] that's the truth that's another thought
[2:11:15] I felt like the Lord wanted me to put in
[2:11:17] there not so much about the body or
[2:11:19] everybody around us
[2:11:21] amen but Lord help us to have the Holy
[2:11:23] Ghost to think about everybody around us
[2:11:25] the eternal life is living for others
[2:11:27] not yourself
[2:11:30] amen
[2:11:32] according to the effects of working in
[2:11:35] the measure of every part how many
[2:11:39] believe that
[2:11:40] what was it even our I'm not sure if
[2:11:43] it's Brian or Brother David talking
[2:11:44] about everybody that does something
[2:11:46] amen I think it was Brother David
[2:11:48] mentioning everybody that does something
[2:11:50] it makes it all come together it makes
[2:11:52] it all work
[2:11:54] praise be to God
[2:11:57] oh my every major of every part making
[2:12:00] increase of the body unto the edifying
[2:12:04] of itself
[2:12:06] in love
[2:12:09] praise be to God I appreciate this
[2:12:11] morning I thank God for every part
[2:12:14] amen
[2:12:15] you know sometimes people don't come to
[2:12:17] church
[2:12:19] stay home they come don't come to church
[2:12:21] listen if we're looking for a body of
[2:12:23] Christ and half the body's gone well the
[2:12:25] arm's gone
[2:12:27] huh
[2:12:28] maybe I am in corner is gone
[2:12:32] foreign
[2:12:34] I thought about this and thinking about
[2:12:36] this you know I come from the Amish and
[2:12:38] I'll tell you what whenever you've got
[2:12:39] about four horses and you're riding on
[2:12:42] that riding plow I mean those Forest
[2:12:44] horses pulling brother John they just
[2:12:47] have to do a certain amount they don't
[2:12:49] have to do all that much
[2:12:51] money can go further that's why they use
[2:12:53] mortgage
[2:12:54] morning but when you got three like we
[2:12:56] did well you just see them back ham
[2:12:58] hocks remember my name you see them
[2:13:00] Moses muscles bulging a little bit more
[2:13:02] because they got to work harder at it
[2:13:04] now right if you've got two well they're
[2:13:06] just gonna really struggle them that's
[2:13:07] kind of how it is in our services a lot
[2:13:09] of time when you just got a few guess
[2:13:11] what the ones that are there they gotta
[2:13:12] really pull
[2:13:15] did you ever notice now big connections
[2:13:17] with everybody hey man hallelujah boy
[2:13:19] it's easy for the preacher to preach
[2:13:22] I still gotta figure a way for you to
[2:13:25] substitute a good old-fashioned pulling
[2:13:27] of a amen
[2:13:31] oh it's a boy I appreciate people
[2:13:33] supported with their ties their offering
[2:13:35] but you know you are also support it
[2:13:37] with your presence
[2:13:39] and you ought to support it with your
[2:13:40] Amen brother bam said if you want them
[2:13:42] they're sick him you gotta say amen mean
[2:13:44] second it means go get him it didn't
[2:13:46] mean raise your hands sometimes I gotta
[2:13:49] have a discernment to find out whether
[2:13:50] you're really getting what you're
[2:13:51] getting or not
[2:13:54] the Holy Ghost punctuated it's really
[2:13:56] not that hard folks they're pretty
[2:13:59] teach yourself to say Amen
[2:14:03] not out of line at all you didn't say
[2:14:06] say grin
[2:14:10] I don't think
[2:14:12] about it I don't I don't know what
[2:14:14] you're going to substitute an amen with
[2:14:16] how are you going to pull without a amen
[2:14:19] as a matter of fact can I preach it
[2:14:22] don't matter to me a bit whenever
[2:14:23] somebody yeah that's what preaching
[2:14:26] brother it don't bother me but it just
[2:14:27] gets me going Morehead
[2:14:31] but that does bother man it does bother
[2:14:33] I do
[2:14:34] believe that it hinders despair when you
[2:14:36] sit there with your arm folded like I'm
[2:14:39] not on a log
[2:14:41] no reaction at all
[2:14:44] I heard better man said the other day
[2:14:45] sometimes he'll go out here and he'll
[2:14:47] start preaching and he'll get the feel
[2:14:48] of how the people are reacting to what
[2:14:50] he says as to what he says
[2:14:53] no that's the first one I've heard him
[2:14:55] preach about many different things but
[2:14:57] get the feel of the people amen and see
[2:14:59] what it is where they're at and then go
[2:15:01] from there
[2:15:03] is that okay this morning
[2:15:05] we got a pool I may believe we need to
[2:15:07] pour together Sunday nights especially
[2:15:09] on our first Sunday of the month I like
[2:15:10] kind of so I felt that it was our Lord's
[2:15:13] will for us to have a first Sunday in a
[2:15:14] month and so forth but you know and I'll
[2:15:16] tell you what it's the hardest time
[2:15:17] Brother David we all know it's the
[2:15:19] hardest time aiming to have churches
[2:15:20] after you eat a big old meal that
[2:15:22] everybody's cooked that's so good with
[2:15:24] all of them good desserts and stuff
[2:15:28] I picked a different picture that's got
[2:15:30] to preach
[2:15:32] I don't say that I can't come up here if
[2:15:34] everybody's as quiet as a mouse even if
[2:15:36] I'm under the anointing God does it but
[2:15:38] I'm telling you it helps a lot more if
[2:15:40] you got amens and hallelujahs and people
[2:15:42] pulling how many believe me
[2:15:44] oh that's Paul amen everybody not just
[2:15:48] one not just the other one
[2:15:52] Scott Burt and dick that was the name of
[2:15:55] all horses at home now I'll tell you
[2:15:57] what if one black behind we had a whip
[2:16:00] whack everybody pull even Hallelujah I
[2:16:05] believe that's what we need to do let's
[2:16:06] not put it because it lost a lot of
[2:16:07] times while we do hey man will be
[2:16:09] pulling back and the other one is
[2:16:11] for a second going in that way but when
[2:16:13] everybody's pulling at the same time
[2:16:16] it makes for a good service the Holy
[2:16:18] Spirit the common that amen do what he
[2:16:22] does need to do praise the Lord
[2:16:25] all right can I read you a quote
[2:16:27] we're just getting started
[2:16:30] now notice you've got tapes on that
[2:16:31] you've got tapes on what we believe you
[2:16:33] got tapes on the discipline of the
[2:16:35] church how to behave ourselves in church
[2:16:38] when we come together to sit together in
[2:16:40] Heavenly places
[2:16:42] he says don't stay home
[2:16:50] I've got wrote down here you know except
[2:16:53] for our elderly perhaps I can't make it
[2:16:55] out
[2:16:56] or perhaps a sick person that can't make
[2:16:58] it out and also the backslid
[2:17:02] [Music]
[2:17:04] that's right if you're streaming this
[2:17:06] morning and you could be in church
[2:17:07] you're backslid
[2:17:13] cause you can't pull out there I can't
[2:17:15] hear you
[2:17:16] and I can't feel you
[2:17:19] oh my
[2:17:22] is that okay
[2:17:24] praise the Lord
[2:17:26] now notice
[2:17:27] don't stay home and stream so I'm gonna
[2:17:30] put that in there all right when you
[2:17:32] can't be in the house of God
[2:17:35] if God is in your heart you can't hardly
[2:17:38] wait for them doors to open up out
[2:17:40] yonder
[2:17:44] engine for you to get in here to
[2:17:46] fellowship with your brothers
[2:17:49] another place he says man if you ain't
[2:17:51] got so much of the love of God in your
[2:17:53] heart amen until you almost weak when
[2:17:55] you leave out though sir when you leave
[2:17:57] one another by weeping
[2:18:03] a man can hardly leave one another we
[2:18:05] love each other so much
[2:18:12] that's what he says man you can't hardly
[2:18:14] wait if you've got God in your heart
[2:18:16] let's become blessed for us maybe God
[2:18:20] ain't there well you might say
[2:18:22] it is but if you had a reminder if you
[2:18:24] had a little bit a little bit more of
[2:18:26] the Holy Ghost it'll give you enough
[2:18:28] power to get in the shower to get
[2:18:30] dressed get in your car turn the key on
[2:18:32] and drive a few miles come to church say
[2:18:34] Amen pray the Lord's support to God and
[2:18:37] Paul and fight this devil that we're
[2:18:40] fighting get on the front line and be a
[2:18:44] lawyer quit pulling back
[2:18:50] don't go back don't sit down don't sit
[2:18:53] out I want to be right in the front line
[2:18:57] how we appreciate these people do
[2:19:00] hey man I appreciate brother Joe's
[2:19:02] prayer when it comes to church amen to
[2:19:04] sincerity Praise Him by the taught me
[2:19:06] what he's done
[2:19:07] I'm technical I ain't got no criticism
[2:19:09] of somebody trying to do something for
[2:19:11] God
[2:19:14] do something
[2:19:16] you're called to do something but it's
[2:19:18] important that you find what God wants
[2:19:19] you to do don't try to take somebody
[2:19:21] else's place
[2:19:23] and if God says have something for you
[2:19:25] to believe me he'll get you on the job
[2:19:29] if you'll open your heart up and find
[2:19:31] out what it is that God wants you to do
[2:19:38] because this is what makes all the
[2:19:40] difference this is the front line This
[2:19:43] is where we all pull this is what we all
[2:19:44] support isn't that right
[2:19:46] with everything we got because this is
[2:19:48] where families are made this is where
[2:19:49] Sinners are saved
[2:19:51] we don't need to be sitting here the
[2:19:53] doctors don't need to be sick when to
[2:19:54] sit coming here they should be able to
[2:19:56] be recovered
[2:19:59] but when we come in here and we're sick
[2:20:01] well then it's just not a whole lot of
[2:20:03] fun is it
[2:20:04] oh Hallelujah
[2:20:07] oh my that's right now listen to
[2:20:09] fellowship with your brothers and if you
[2:20:12] don't feel that way I'm telling you you
[2:20:14] better go to France
[2:20:17] why because you when you get on your
[2:20:19] knees I'll tell you them old thorns and
[2:20:20] them Briars and then that stickiness and
[2:20:23] that backslitting us and look up by the
[2:20:25] wayside I can't encourage you enough
[2:20:26] that in the local body it's important to
[2:20:28] have prayer Warrior people who pray if
[2:20:31] you know where you ought to be with God
[2:20:33] why don't you pray a little bit more
[2:20:36] it'll put the love of God in your heart
[2:20:39] it'll take the Spurs and the stickers
[2:20:41] and the complaining in the Marvel
[2:20:43] illegal by the wayside and it'll bring a
[2:20:45] floor a nice wonderful sauce rose with
[2:20:49] fragrance and people who want to be
[2:20:51] around you
[2:21:01] 40.
[2:21:03] and you'll want to be around people
[2:21:08] but when you get her when you get back
[2:21:10] sled you don't want to go to church
[2:21:12] you don't want to be around people
[2:21:15] because you're miserable
[2:21:16] you don't feel like it
[2:21:18] you know
[2:21:20] you get right with God you want to share
[2:21:22] your life hug somebody
[2:21:25] oh give me that old time Legend it makes
[2:21:28] me love everybody
[2:21:32] [Music]
[2:21:38] amen Lord help us
[2:21:40] there ought to be shouts in the house of
[2:21:42] God there ought to be amens in the house
[2:21:43] of God
[2:21:47] amen
[2:21:50] then you better get to pray
[2:21:52] because we're in the last days the Bible
[2:21:54] exalted us that we ought to come
[2:21:56] together so much some more as we see
[2:21:58] that they're approaching to love one
[2:22:00] another with Christian love divine love
[2:22:02] to our assemble ourselves together in
[2:22:05] Heavenly places
[2:22:06] and to love one another time but this
[2:22:09] all men know that you're my
[2:22:10] disciples if you've got love one for
[2:22:12] another
[2:22:14] all the gifts the different things we do
[2:22:17] that's all fine but Paul said I'll show
[2:22:19] you a better way amen you up need
[2:22:21] charity you determine charity amongst
[2:22:23] yourself because charity is the bond of
[2:22:26] the purpose of a group or a family it's
[2:22:28] the bond that ties them together it's
[2:22:30] the clue that glues them together
[2:22:35] laughs
[2:22:37] you lose your love find out how quickly
[2:22:40] you flake off a church
[2:22:44] lose your love for God
[2:22:46] that's why you need to go to pray it
[2:22:52] amen
[2:22:54] praise the Lord Brother Branham typed it
[2:22:55] when he was preaching on Ephesians
[2:22:58] Parish parallels Joshua and he was
[2:23:00] talking about Joshua when he went into
[2:23:01] the land took Jericho and dropped the
[2:23:03] walls of Jericho isn't that right
[2:23:05] amen without losing all they had to do
[2:23:07] was March and sing and grow trumpets
[2:23:12] right
[2:23:14] listen he says in that sort of church is
[2:23:16] failing today on that wall do you know
[2:23:18] that even your behavior can knock
[2:23:20] somebody else out of getting healed your
[2:23:22] misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You
[2:23:24] Believers can cause this check to
[2:23:27] bitterly fail and on the day of judgment
[2:23:29] you'll read me Municipal foreign
[2:23:34] with the right heart
[2:23:36] you need to cut
[2:23:38] your sins confess you need to be clean
[2:23:40] when you come
[2:23:43] whoo
[2:23:46] he talks about dwighted those innocent
[2:23:48] men die because one man stepped out of
[2:23:50] line you see the reason this needs to be
[2:23:53] taught the church lining up with the
[2:23:55] word of God lining up with God and
[2:23:57] lining up with each other how maybe we
[2:24:00] got to be left up with each other
[2:24:03] as the body of Christ
[2:24:06] when your body
[2:24:08] everything needs to be in order
[2:24:10] amen
[2:24:12] when one finger hurts the whole body
[2:24:15] hurts
[2:24:16] amen the robotic focuses on that isn't
[2:24:19] that right
[2:24:20] Brother Band says don't never let a
[2:24:22] little ISM or a little something another
[2:24:24] a little bad feeling rise up among you
[2:24:28] not even a bad feeling needs to be among
[2:24:31] you
[2:24:32] get it out quick right now oh my it's a
[2:24:36] little foxes that's fals Divine keep it
[2:24:38] out of the way those little funny
[2:24:40] feelings why have half a church when you
[2:24:42] can have a whole church why is that the
[2:24:44] substitute when the skies are full of
[2:24:46] the real oh my we don't want that you
[2:24:49] have a little funny feeling ever comes
[2:24:51] up among new members one to another God
[2:24:53] or that person and so forth amen now
[2:24:55] unless he says Satan will constantly
[2:24:57] punch at you until you're finished on
[2:24:59] Earth I mean when you've got a glocal
[2:25:01] group and you've got a bite I need to
[2:25:03] cry the devil will never stop trying
[2:25:06] he will always try
[2:25:09] until you finish on Earth just remember
[2:25:10] that you'll never have a time but what
[2:25:12] you're punching a punching is going on
[2:25:14] all the time cause you're in a bottle
[2:25:16] did you come to Christ and be on the
[2:25:19] picnic no we're the battlefield brother
[2:25:24] amen
[2:25:25] this isn't the picnic
[2:25:27] it's a Battlefield
[2:25:29] praise be to God
[2:25:32] oh my just one listen to this that's
[2:25:35] right stay right together Christ is the
[2:25:37] mystery of Christ revealed if a brother
[2:25:38] or sister is a little wrong or a sister
[2:25:40] let me just say this this is the way I
[2:25:42] thought about it sometimes we say things
[2:25:44] we ought to say
[2:25:47] somebody makes a statement that says
[2:25:49] something they shouldn't and it takes us
[2:25:50] off
[2:25:52] or we don't like it
[2:25:53] hello
[2:25:55] sometimes us sometimes we do things that
[2:25:58] sin sometimes we do things that's wrong
[2:26:01] [Music]
[2:26:02] but we do we write that family member
[2:26:05] off because of a dude with free
[2:26:06] condemnation oh they ain't got a deal I
[2:26:08] think no good no don't do that
[2:26:11] cause I'll tell you what if they did
[2:26:12] that for you and for me we'd be gonna
[2:26:14] run it
[2:26:16] no you're praying for that person say
[2:26:18] God help us I'm praying for you brother
[2:26:20] I'm praying for you sister
[2:26:22] no you don't
[2:26:24] condone the wrong and you want the wrong
[2:26:26] life but don't never build up a complex
[2:26:28] isn't that right
[2:26:30] oh my they're a little wrong don't never
[2:26:32] let me have a root of bitterness spring
[2:26:34] up
[2:26:36] oh my never how many knows I've been in
[2:26:38] US hey man it is a root of bitterness
[2:26:40] that is oh it'll take Christ listen
[2:26:43] it'll take Christ right out of my life
[2:26:45] it'll affect that person that poison
[2:26:47] eyes the acids of malice and jealousy
[2:26:49] and hatred it'll just take the Holy
[2:26:51] Spirit right away from you
[2:26:53] how many of the second you allow
[2:26:55] yourself to get bitter amen the Holy
[2:26:57] Spirit leaves
[2:27:00] the second you allowed bitterness to
[2:27:02] take a hold of your heart the Holy
[2:27:04] Spirit left
[2:27:07] that's why we need prayer because prayer
[2:27:10] sweetens it changes you when you come
[2:27:12] from the presence of the prayer you
[2:27:15] can't come back out and have thought and
[2:27:16] bitterness against people
[2:27:19] or you never went deep enough in your
[2:27:20] prayer
[2:27:24] oh my listen
[2:27:26] it'll just take the Holy Spirit right
[2:27:28] away from you it'll run him from the
[2:27:31] Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of
[2:27:33] God and drive him away from here
[2:27:37] oh my moms and dad y'all know when
[2:27:40] there's fussing and fuming going amongst
[2:27:42] the kids boy it sure brings a damper on
[2:27:44] the whole thing don't it
[2:27:46] you try to get that brother that sister
[2:27:47] to get right when they're playing
[2:27:48] together and have fun together then Mom
[2:27:50] and Dad smiling amen
[2:27:53] that's right
[2:27:55] Unity
[2:27:57] don't let her let a root of bitterness
[2:27:59] don't ever let it even come in it'll
[2:28:01] drive this spirit away from here
[2:28:04] you'll wonder why we ain't got Revival
[2:28:06] that's why we ain't got Revival
[2:28:08] one person can affect the whole church
[2:28:12] and guess what better band says you'll
[2:28:13] answer for it on the day of judgment for
[2:28:15] your attitude how many believes that the
[2:28:17] Holy Spirit brings the right attitude it
[2:28:19] brings a gentle sweet atmosphere amen
[2:28:21] and bitterness and hatred it brings the
[2:28:23] wrong spirit
[2:28:25] causes people not to get what they need
[2:28:27] when they come to church
[2:28:29] hey man why are you saying this brother
[2:28:31] bottle I'm not saying because we were in
[2:28:33] that state I'm saying heads up
[2:28:37] he'll never stop trying
[2:28:40] so everyone one of us got to have our
[2:28:42] guards up Lord if we want to have a good
[2:28:43] judge if we will have a powerful judge
[2:28:45] if we want to have a real judge we got
[2:28:47] to keep the Devils out we gotta get the
[2:28:49] attitude right
[2:28:55] local church
[2:28:57] with everything you got
[2:29:02] best chance we have of defeating the
[2:29:03] devil
[2:29:05] amen
[2:29:09] Hallelujah
[2:29:13] oh yeah
[2:29:15] now notice it'll kill the spirit of God
[2:29:18] and drive it from here hurt your pastor
[2:29:20] it'll do everything don't do that you
[2:29:22] just wax that much closer together
[2:29:25] and then I preached a couple weeks ago
[2:29:27] that God wants more preparing more fruit
[2:29:29] now we want to last closer together how
[2:29:31] many we need to walk closer together
[2:29:33] love one another they're more than what
[2:29:35] we do
[2:29:37] oh brother Donnie Reagan and some of
[2:29:38] that sad stuff probably all up in there
[2:29:40] great big church but when you got a
[2:29:42] small group
[2:29:44] it affects a whole lot more
[2:29:46] because it don't take long and half of
[2:29:48] them is affected
[2:29:49] amen
[2:29:50] it can affect 50 100 people in the big
[2:29:53] churches and you'll never even know it
[2:29:55] ah
[2:30:00] but I know he preaches this and I know
[2:30:02] he tries to get that out of there too
[2:30:03] hey man ain't nobody wants all of that
[2:30:04] up in there
[2:30:06] praise your God
[2:30:08] amen
[2:30:10] all right now notice
[2:30:13] are you ready
[2:30:15] all right wax that much closer together
[2:30:17] grow up amen praise him get it up a
[2:30:20] little talk a little closer together
[2:30:22] tighten tighten up move right up close
[2:30:24] one to another
[2:30:26] love one another anyhow talk nice about
[2:30:28] one another say nice things about one
[2:30:31] another and then God will bless
[2:30:34] how many dollars that whenever Joshua
[2:30:37] man they were so plastic defeated Derek
[2:30:40] on the walls came down
[2:30:42] because they were all in harmony
[2:30:44] but when Aiken stepped out of line
[2:30:46] when he stepped out of line and did
[2:30:48] that's in 36 men lost their lives on a
[2:30:52] little bitty battle
[2:30:53] amen
[2:30:55] praise the Lord
[2:31:00] amen
[2:31:01] all right last quote
[2:31:04] how many beliefs forgiveness is
[2:31:06] important
[2:31:07] in a home in the family in the body it
[2:31:11] is absolutely vital that you have
[2:31:13] forgiveness
[2:31:15] and it takes prayer how many believes it
[2:31:17] takes care of prayer and the Holy Ghost
[2:31:20] to have that forgiveness one for another
[2:31:23] because we will do things wrong we're
[2:31:24] human as long as we're here we'll make
[2:31:26] mistakes
[2:31:27] but it's how we deal with those mistakes
[2:31:30] and things amen
[2:31:32] and we need prayer to softness
[2:31:35] I come to The Garden Alone while the
[2:31:37] deer are still on the Roses amen and he
[2:31:40] walks with me and talks with me amen and
[2:31:43] he tells me I am his own when we come
[2:31:45] from there it's just a whole different
[2:31:47] atmosphere prayer brings love amen
[2:31:52] praise be to God now listen
[2:31:55] brother bam says shortly after all these
[2:31:57] years on the field and around the world
[2:31:58] I'm seeing different people I know a
[2:32:00] little bit about what get to internet if
[2:32:03] you want to get somewhere with God don't
[2:32:05] live in it an arrogant Spirit ever come
[2:32:07] around you that no let No Malice come in
[2:32:11] no matter what anybody's done if they're
[2:32:13] wrong don't you never build up a complex
[2:32:15] against that person
[2:32:17] amen you be sweet and kind remember God
[2:32:21] loved you when you were in sin and if
[2:32:24] the spirit of God's in you you love the
[2:32:26] other person when he is in the wrong
[2:32:28] amen remember the scripture said what
[2:32:30] place he says you know uh if somebody's
[2:32:32] done you wrong even if Christ has
[2:32:34] forgiven you forgive them
[2:32:38] laughs
[2:32:42] but again I have come to the conclusion
[2:32:45] a long time ago
[2:32:48] that I can afford I can afford a lot of
[2:32:53] forgiveness
[2:32:57] I can afford it
[2:32:59] why can I afford it
[2:33:03] because a lot was forgiven me
[2:33:07] I'm gonna tell you right now there was
[2:33:09] more forgiveness given me than I'll ever
[2:33:12] forgive
[2:33:13] amen
[2:33:15] isn't that right
[2:33:17] that's right when you think about how
[2:33:18] much God forgives you forgives you every
[2:33:20] day isn't that right how many how many
[2:33:23] with me oh he begins me all the time
[2:33:27] hey man so you can afford to forgive
[2:33:30] others
[2:33:33] things that you think that God wouldn't
[2:33:35] hardly even give you for he forgive you
[2:33:37] you grieved him away from you so many
[2:33:39] times and he forgave you came right back
[2:33:41] in
[2:33:42] you built up internet Soul folks
[2:33:47] can I say something that just comes to
[2:33:49] mind
[2:33:51] if you have bitterness in your heart
[2:33:54] and you overcome it God will allow that
[2:33:57] he'll heal loud another bitterness to
[2:33:59] come your way to see whether you can
[2:34:01] really conquer that or not
[2:34:03] until you learned hey I ain't gonna let
[2:34:05] that bitterness come on in
[2:34:07] Hale keeps strengthening and
[2:34:09] strengthening and the strengthening amen
[2:34:13] and you yeah I can't test you on
[2:34:15] bitterness outside of somebody doing you
[2:34:17] wrong or saying something about you that
[2:34:18] you don't like
[2:34:22] wouldn't it be nice for the John if we
[2:34:24] had a mouth that always said the perfect
[2:34:26] thing every time never said anything to
[2:34:29] you that would be so nice
[2:34:31] no not Thomas Byler
[2:34:34] in his rum bunches they don't call me
[2:34:35] rhombus for nothing
[2:34:39] rather than Martin
[2:34:42] I don't know why God ever wanted me to
[2:34:44] be a pastor brother but here I am
[2:34:47] two rumbas two two rough
[2:34:51] too rough cut Amish come from up the
[2:34:53] north some of them both Northern people
[2:34:55] they ain't got very soon much sensitive
[2:34:57] I don't know how you all put up with me
[2:34:58] I have no idea
[2:35:00] but anyway we try we just want to serve
[2:35:04] God right my hearts are desires Lord
[2:35:06] show me where I'm a little tumor on this
[2:35:08] yet take that away Lord Jesus and help
[2:35:11] me to stay sweet and kind no matter what
[2:35:14] what comes or what goes
[2:35:18] I
[2:35:21] let me see
[2:35:22] yeah I'm coming down to something I want
[2:35:24] to say here
[2:35:31] amen be sweet and kind remember God
[2:35:34] loved you
[2:35:35] but I like this this is like
[2:35:37] I put in highlights above everything
[2:35:41] Church
[2:35:42] above everything love
[2:35:45] God and love one another
[2:35:49] above everything I mean it was rather
[2:35:51] than having all the gifts of Miracles
[2:35:53] and healings and all these other things
[2:35:55] that's all important it's all your
[2:35:57] apartment above everything Paul even
[2:35:58] said make sure that you have fervent
[2:36:00] charity amongst yourselves
[2:36:05] how many could use a little bit more of
[2:36:06] that love
[2:36:08] I need I need to one I need to love God
[2:36:10] more are you with me how many of these
[2:36:11] love God more
[2:36:13] because then I can love my brother more
[2:36:15] man it would be a failure wouldn't the
[2:36:17] brother Brad to try to love my brother
[2:36:19] more when I don't love God the way I
[2:36:20] should I don't think he would even do it
[2:36:22] amen but if you love God
[2:36:24] even when the more you love God I
[2:36:27] thought of that song and I want to sing
[2:36:28] it amen makes me love everybody give me
[2:36:31] that old-time religion give me the old
[2:36:34] time Holy Spirit
[2:36:38] oh my I don't feel the devil anywhere
[2:36:41] close to me right now nowhere close to
[2:36:43] me at all
[2:36:44] it's just somewhere else right because
[2:36:46] the devil walked on there when you got
[2:36:48] the Holy Ghost he can't even come close
[2:36:50] I don't feel no Spirit of defensive I
[2:36:52] don't feel sad I don't feel any of that
[2:36:54] why because I got the Holy Ghost the
[2:36:56] devil cake on there
[2:36:58] the reason people say it and that's good
[2:37:01] enough for me
[2:37:03] so give me that all-time Holy Spirit
[2:37:07] amen
[2:37:09] praise the Lord how many we need more of
[2:37:11] it more of that Holy Ghost
[2:37:13] amen let's support our church amen
[2:37:16] support each other amen love one another
[2:37:21] praise be to God like I said there's no
[2:37:24] big eyes and little use I don't care if

[2:37:44] of that dirt and that dust that we get
[2:37:46] on our feet and everything else amen
[2:37:49] others

[2:39:20] like to have something deeper Lord if

[2:41:51] here with me I sure would
[2:41:54] amen
[2:41:56] praise be to God

[2:42:06] to one another pray for that man that
[2:42:08] he'll be saved to a woman whoever the

[2:42:30] respects he'll lead you through cause
[2:42:33] he's ordained of God to do so
[2:42:37] I thought brother by of all the bad
[2:42:39] thing of all the poor pastors that I
[2:42:42] have thought that I have been when I
[2:42:43] read that something quicker to me and I
[2:42:45] said you know look at what's happened
[2:42:47] over the last 30 years

[2:42:53] we amen because the pastor and it's
[2:42:55] ordained of God will take you through
[2:42:59] whatever comes he'll take you through
[2:43:02] amen and we can say amen God has helped
[2:43:05] us to make it through many things isn't
[2:43:07] that right how many beliefs if he's
[2:43:09] ordained of God he's ordained to take
[2:43:11] you through not just amen because
[2:43:13] there's so many things that can topple a
[2:43:16] person isn't that right

[2:43:35] looking for a party change but before
[2:43:37] that body change Comes This flash has to
[2:43:40] come into obedience
[2:43:42] it's got to come subject to the word
[2:43:44] before it to be subject to the skies
[2:43:46] and that's what we're working on that's
[2:43:47] why we come to church that's why you
[2:43:49] listen to Somebody ball you out a little
[2:43:51] bit about this I don't know once in a
[2:43:52] while we need correction I need

[2:44:05] thing after that quote he says now
