[9:28] House of the Lord this morning, isn't
[9:29] it?
[9:31] Amen.
[9:39] Brian, would you open the service in a
[9:41] word of prayer, please?
[10:25] Amen. The children may be dismissed for
[10:28] Sunday school this morning. And if we
[10:30] could turn to Psalm 63 this morning and
[10:33] Amen.
[10:38] It's good to see each and everyone out
[10:40] this morning. We have a lot gone, but
[10:42] just pray that God will come and speak
[10:44] to our hearts this morning. Amen. And
[10:46] for those that are streaming, God bless
[10:48] you this morning. Amen. Psalm 63:1 says,
[10:52] "Oh God, thou art my God. Early will I
[10:55] seek thee. My soul thirsteth for thee.
[10:57] My flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
[11:00] thirsty land where no water is.
[11:10] Because thy loving kindness is better
[11:12] than life, my lips shall praise thee.
[11:21] My soul shall be satisfied as with
[11:24] marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall
[11:26] praise thee with joyful lips.
[11:35] Because thou has been my help, therefore
[11:38] in the shadow of thy wings will I
[11:40] rejoice.
[11:47] But those that seek my soul to destroy
[11:50] it shall go into the lower parts of the
[11:52] earth.
[11:59] But the king shall rejoice in God.
[12:02] Everyone that swearth by him shall
[12:05] glory. But the mouth of them that
[12:10] Amen. Brother Brian
[12:27] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Hope you've all had a good week. Hope
[12:33] God's been good to you and blessed you.
[12:37] I was thinking of some of them quotes
[12:41] that were up on the board this morning
[12:43] and I was just really thinking of it
[12:47] what it's really saying for us as
[12:50] believers and the synopsis I get out of
[12:53] reading all those quotes in scriptures
[12:56] everything that God was he put in Christ
[12:59] and everything that Christ was he put in
[13:02] his church and that church is
[13:04] individuals
[13:06] not a building somewhere, not a
[13:08] denomination,
[13:09] not an idea, but it's people that
[13:12] assemble together in the presence of
[13:14] Jesus Christ to worship him. And it and
[13:17] I was really thinking how
[13:21] how wonderful is to think that God loves
[13:23] us enough that he cares about us, that
[13:26] he's willing to lead us every day of our
[13:29] lives in the word of God and in service
[13:31] to him. And I was um thinking this
[13:34] morning, I hope I haven't lost my place
[13:37] here.
[13:39] If you would turn with me to Ezekiel the
[13:42] u
[13:43] the 11th chapter
[13:46] and I can, you know, I everyone has
[13:48] their own certain circumstances.
[13:50] Everyone's an individual. And I was I've
[13:52] been working on something this week and
[13:54] I was just thinking there's two examples
[13:56] I got out of it. We all know that
[13:59] there's two ways that we that people go.
[14:02] Either they open their hearts and have a
[14:05] a saving relationship with Jesus Christ
[14:08] or they join church. There's just two
[14:10] things that people do. Or they just
[14:12] choose to be unbelievers out there in
[14:15] the world. And I was thinking what how
[14:18] miserable would we be this morning if we
[14:20] were a piece of equipment or something
[14:23] that we just added parts to. We never
[14:26] had a changing relationship with Jesus
[14:29] Christ this morning. We would at the end
[14:31] of your life, just think of what you
[14:33] would be. All the things that were added
[14:35] and added and added. You'd be under such
[14:38] weight that you wouldn't even make it to
[14:40] the other side. Or you can come the
[14:42] right way and give your everything that
[14:45] you are to Christ and have a
[14:47] relationship that changes you where it's
[14:50] God doing it and not you trying to do it
[14:53] yourself. And that's the problem with
[14:54] the churches out there. They don't want
[14:57] you to be liberated in Jesus Christ.
[14:59] They want you to be following after man
[15:02] and ideas, not following after Jesus
[15:05] Christ this morning. But I was um
[15:09] uh I hope I didn't lose my place here. I
[15:11] know where I want to start. Uh starting
[15:14] in about the 16th verse of the 11th
[15:17] chapter of Ezekiel this morning.
[15:20] You know, you can I know I say this a
[15:23] lot. Unless God touches your heart or
[15:25] unless God speaks to you, you can have
[15:27] all the ideas in the world, but if God
[15:30] don't quicken it, it doesn't mean
[15:31] anything. So, I'll start at about the
[15:34] 16th verse. Therefore, say, thus sayeth
[15:36] the Lord God, although I have cast them
[15:39] far off among the heathen, he's talking
[15:41] about the tribes of Israel. And although
[15:44] I have scattered them among the
[15:46] countries, yet will I be to them as a
[15:49] little sanctuary in the countries where
[15:52] they shall come. So I can read something
[15:55] like that. No matter what God does,
[15:58] he's always got a remembrance for his
[16:00] his troop, his believers. He was even
[16:03] going to make a way for him in all the
[16:05] places that they were sending sending
[16:07] him. Therefore say, thus saith the Lord
[16:10] God, I will either gather you from the
[16:13] people and assemble you out of the
[16:15] countries where you have been scared,
[16:17] and I will give you the land of Israel,
[16:19] and they shall come thither, and they
[16:21] shall take away all the detestable
[16:23] things,
[16:25] excuse me, and therefore all the
[16:27] abomination that are from hence. And
[16:30] this is what I was thinking about this
[16:32] morning, what I said earlier. and I will
[16:34] give them one heart and I will put in a
[16:36] new spirit within them and I will take
[16:38] the stony heart out of their flesh and I
[16:41] will give them a heart of flesh. And
[16:43] what I was thinking this morning and
[16:45] reading the quotes and the scriptures
[16:47] were up there and what brother Joe was
[16:49] saying and the ministers from the last
[16:52] couple, it's that just one scripture
[16:54] right there is really so important for
[16:56] us as believers.
[18:47] And it's red.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; You don't know how many times when I'm
[19:09] talking on the phone, I have bad
[19:11] So, I wind up screaming on the phone and
[19:13] I'm not angry. I'm not upset. I'll just
[19:16] be honest with you. People have
[19:17] complained to my employer because they
[19:19] think I'm angry when I'm talking on the
[19:22] phone. I'm just being honest.
[19:31] I'm thinking you I'll just read what
[19:33] what Paul had to say here. But really,
[19:35] what I was thinking this morning, I I
[19:37] was in my office. I was thinking,
[19:41] you know, just desiring to see what the
[19:43] Lord would have for me or have for us.
[19:46] And it really struck me this morning
[19:48] that in the age that we live in with
[19:51] everything that's going wrong, how much
[19:53] more should it bring us to the foot of
[19:55] the cross to not want to leave there
[19:57] this morning that we're so dependent on
[20:00] everything that we do and say has to be
[20:04] through the word of God and in Jesus
[20:06] Christ this morning. But I'll just read
[20:08] with this these scriptures here. What
[20:11] shall we say then? Shall we continue in
[20:13] sin that grace may abound? And that goes
[20:16] up to some of the scriptures. No, we
[20:18] won't stay in sin so grace may abound.
[20:21] That's the religious world out there
[20:24] that take grace to disgrace this
[20:26] morning. God forbid. How shall we that
[20:29] are dead to sin live any longer therein?
[20:32] Know you not that so many of us who were
[20:34] baptized in Jesus Christ were baptized
[20:37] into his death? And you know some
[20:39] baptismal services they read the sixth
[20:42] chapter. Therefore we are buried with
[20:44] him by baptism into death that like as
[20:48] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[20:49] the glory of the father even so we also
[20:53] shall walk in the newness of life. So
[20:56] there's a change that happens. The old
[20:58] man isn't there anymore. And you have to
[21:01] keep the old man dead.
[21:03] And it goes, "For if we have been
[21:06] planted together in the likeness of his
[21:08] death, we also shall be in the likeness
[21:11] of his resurrection." That's that's a
[21:14] comforting thought right there. Knowing
[21:16] this, that our old man is crucified with
[21:19] him. This is really important.
[21:20] Everything that you were before that has
[21:23] to mean dead. Never can come back again.
[21:26] Does that not mean that your enemy is
[21:28] going to fight with you to the day you
[21:30] die or a rapture trying to bring back
[21:32] that old man? No. There's but you're
[21:34] going to with that experience where God
[21:36] has changed your heart and life. It
[21:38] gives you the strength to let that old
[21:40] man lay dead in your and it goes on to
[21:43] say knowing that this for we have he
[21:46] that is dead is freed from sin. Now if
[21:49] we be dead with Christ we believe that
[21:51] we shall also live with him. Knowing
[21:54] Christ began raised from the dead, dead
[21:57] dieth no more. Death hath no more
[21:59] dominion over him. And that's the same
[22:02] with us. That old man has no more
[22:04] dominion. For in that he died, he died
[22:06] unto sin once. But he that he liveth, he
[22:09] liveth unto God. Likewise reckon we also
[22:12] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
[22:14] but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ
[22:17] our Lord. I I don't really have a lot to
[22:21] say this morning, but I was just
[22:24] just
[22:26] thinking how important it is for us this
[22:28] morning to know who you are in Jesus
[22:31] Christ this morning. I don't have a lot
[22:33] to I know I say this a lot, but I was
[22:36] thinking for the last couple hours this
[22:37] morning, you just alone by myself. You
[22:40] know, it goes back to the psalm that
[22:42] David read. You know, when the night
[22:43] watches, I thought of him when I was
[22:45] awake at night. meditated upon him. So
[22:48] it gives us David 4,000 years ago gave
[22:52] us an example. Everything we do in life
[22:55] I I know we sometimes we get busy doing
[22:57] the things that are required to stay
[22:59] alive in this life. But David said in
[23:03] those psalms and the word of God says
[23:06] that you need to no matter what you're
[23:08] doing, you need to meditate upon the
[23:10] word of God and upon the Lord. If you
[23:12] meditate upon them just like uh I know I
[23:15] read it sometimes from that uh healing
[23:18] thoughts book where brother Brandham
[23:20] talks about the third and fourth chapter
[23:22] of Philippians. Your thoughts have to be
[23:25] on him. Your meditation has to be if you
[23:28] put yourself meditating upon him
[23:30] desiring for his thoughts his ways. If
[23:33] you live that way you you'd be surprised
[23:36] how all the problems that you might do
[23:40] they completely go away. But they just
[23:42] they have no power over you anymore.
[23:44] You're free in Christ this morning. And
[23:46] it's so important that we just meditate
[23:49] and walk in the life that God gives us
[23:51] daily in Jesus Christ this morning,
[23:54] brother.
[24:15] It's good to be here this morning.
[24:18] Let's stand.
[24:20] Let's sing. Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[24:22] and all that is within me.

[28:45] For your mercy never fails me.

[30:10] I've known you as a friend.
[30:14] And I have lived
[30:16] in the goodness of God.
[30:23] And all my life you have been faithful.

[40:32] And I'm amazed
[40:37] at how you care.
[40:42] And through your preious
[40:46] blood
[40:48] I found pardon.
[40:53] And my sins
[40:56] are washed.
[40:58] And they're all washed away. All my sins
[41:06] are washed
[41:08] away.

[41:14] [Music]

[41:22] I'm amazed
[41:26] at how you care.
[41:31] Through your preious
[41:35] blood
[41:36] I found pardon
[41:41] and my sins
[41:44] are washed.
[41:46] They're all washed away. Oh my sins
[41:53] are washed. May let's stand this morning
[41:56] and sing. I believe that you love me.
[41:59] Oh, I believe
[42:02] [Applause]
[42:04] that you love me.
[42:08] And I believe
[42:11] [Music]
[42:13] that you care.
[42:16] [Music]
[42:18] And through your preious
[42:21] blood, I found pardon.
[42:27] And my sins
[42:30] are lost.
[42:32] They're all washed away. All my sins
[42:39] are washed
[42:42] away.
[42:46] Amen. thankful he loves you this
[42:47] morning. Amen. We're gonna invite
[42:49] brother Ber just to come out at this
[42:50] time and take his liberty this morning.
[42:52] And as he sings that, let's just or as
[42:54] he comes, let's sing that one more time.
[42:55] I'm amazed. Oh, I'm amazed.
[43:01] Oh, that you love me.
[43:06] And I'm amazed
[43:11] at how you care.
[43:15] And through your preious
[43:19] blood I found pardon.
[43:25] And my sins
[43:28] are washed.
[43:30] They're all washed away. All my sins
[43:37] are washed
[43:40] away.
[43:43] Oh, I'm amazed
[43:46] [Music]
[43:48] that you love me.
[43:52] Oh, I'm amazed.
[43:57] [Music]
[44:07] &gt;&gt; I found pardon.
[44:09] [Music]
[44:12] My sins,
[44:14] they're washed.
[44:17] They're all washed away in
[44:22] my sins
[44:24] [Music]
[44:26] away.
[44:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. How many's happy
[44:32] for that this morning? Amen. Good
[44:35] morning. It's good to be in the house of
[44:36] the Lord, isn't it? Amen.
[44:40] Amen. And God bless each one of you this
[44:42] morning. Amen. Both those that are
[44:44] present and those that are streaming.
[44:47] Amen. We ask and trust that the Lord
[44:49] will just bless you richly today. Thank
[44:51] you. That'll be all for the music. Amen.
[44:53] Appreciate it. Amen.
[44:56] Praise the Lord.
[44:58] Amen.
[45:03] Amen. We want to have communion this
[45:05] morning. Amen.
[45:07] So, we'll just see, you know, what the
[45:11] Lord will have. Amen. God bless you.
[45:15] Amen. Just good to be in the house of
[45:16] the Lord. Good to see everybody here
[45:18] this morning. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[45:22] Father God, we come before you, Lord
[45:24] Jesus. Once again, assembling in your
[45:25] name as you have asked and said that if
[45:27] we would and would ask anything in your
[45:30] name, you would do it, Lord. We have
[45:32] confidence in that, Lord Jesus. So we
[45:34] ask, Father, that you'll have your way,
[45:36] Lord Jesus. Let the Holy Spirit, Father,
[45:38] do this speaking this morning. Help
[45:40] Thomas Ber just to get out of the way,
[45:42] Lord Jesus, that the gift of God could
[45:44] be operated, Lord, and that you could
[45:46] speak to the people, Father, the thing
[45:48] that you want to say to us this morning,
[45:50] Father. Lord, we ask God, Father, those
[45:52] that'll be traveling today, Father, that
[45:54] you'd give them traveling mercies. We
[45:56] ask for those listening and streaming,
[45:58] Lord. We ask, God, that whatever it is
[46:00] that they have need of, Lord Jesus, that
[46:02] you would meet their need. For we know
[46:04] that you're the same yesterday, today,
[46:05] and forever, Lord. And you will grant
[46:08] each one, Father, of each one of us,
[46:10] what we desire and what we ask for and
[46:12] what we believe for. We just commit this
[46:14] service to you now, asking, Father, for
[46:16] your blessing upon it, the reading of
[46:18] the word, the meditation of our heart in
[46:20] Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. Praise the
[46:23] Lord. Amen. So, I want to do something a
[46:25] little different, I guess, at least gear
[46:28] it different. Amen. How many's heard of
[46:30] uh we have youth services, right? We
[46:32] have people have youth services. So this
[46:35] morning I says, "Well, look, all of our
[46:36] youth are pretty much gone." Amen.
[46:39] Except for those that are still 20 years
[46:40] old or 22, you're still youth, but Amen.
[46:44] youth meaning, of course, perhaps those
[46:46] not married, young, but Amen. I thought
[46:48] we'd have a senior service. Amen. A
[46:51] senior service, a old people service.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] That was kind of different, is it? You
[47:02] don't have no problem with youth
[47:03] services. What about the old folks
[47:05] service? Amen.
[47:07] Amen. So the the terrible thing is is it
[47:11] 60 and over? Older just what it is
[47:13] because you know it just that keeps
[47:16] moving up as you go older, right? Ah 60
[47:19] ain't old, 78 old, you know. But
[47:22] biblically speaking really when you're
[47:24] 60 old you're getting pretty old because
[47:28] man's days were what? three score in 10
[47:30] which is 70 years old and by reason of
[47:33] strength you might have another year 10
[47:35] years so if you get to be 80 years old
[47:37] you're really doing good and if you get
[47:39] to 90 well may the grace of God be with
[47:42] you
[47:45] amen and so amen but anyway being 10
[47:48] years from what God says that are your
[47:51] days amen
[47:54] you know that's that's quite something
[47:55] or or perhaps less for some of us amen
[47:58] Amen. And so, you know, I've read
[48:01] different places where Brother Bam says
[48:02] when we see our hair getting gray and
[48:04] we're getting older, he says we need to
[48:06] buckle up the armor. Amen. Because it's
[48:09] getting getting closer. Ain't that
[48:10] right? Getting closer to time to go
[48:13] home. Amen. And so, we're kind of geared
[48:15] that way. And we'll just see what the
[48:17] Lord will have. Is that okay? All right.
[48:19] Let's All right, let's turn our Bibles
[48:21] if you will. Amen. And I think we'll go
[48:23] to Genesis.
[48:26] Let's start with Genesis 12.
[48:30] Genesis 12.
[48:34] Amen.
[48:39] Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, "Get
[48:42] thee out of thy country, and from thy
[48:44] kindred, and from thy father's house,
[48:47] unto a land that I will show thee. And I
[48:50] will make of thee a great nation, and I
[48:52] will bless thee, and make thy name
[48:54] great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and
[48:57] I will bless them that bless thee, and I
[49:00] will curse them that curse thee, and in
[49:02] thee shall all the families of the earth
[49:05] be blessed." So Abraham departed, and as
[49:08] the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot
[49:10] went with him. Now notice here is his
[49:13] first mistake,
[49:15] right? is is Abraham's first mistake
[49:18] after God chose him. Amen. And called
[49:21] him. Amen. He took Lot along. He said,
[49:24] "Separate from your kindred and from
[49:26] your father's house." But he took Lot
[49:28] with him. And Abraham was 75 years old
[49:31] when he departed out of Heron. And Abram
[49:34] took Sarah, his wife, and Lot his
[49:35] brother's son, and all their substance
[49:37] that they had gathered, and the souls
[49:40] that had they had gotten inherent. I
[49:43] understand that even his daddy went
[49:44] along according to the prophet of God
[49:46] and they went forth to go out into the
[49:49] land of Canaan into the land of Canaan
[49:51] they came. Amen. Amen. Now over we'll
[49:55] just turn to the 17th chapter of
[49:57] Genesis.
[49:59] Amen. And there's a lot that happened in
[50:01] between here. Ain't that right? Amen.
[50:05] Where is this other one?
[50:08] Yeah, we'll go with Genesis 17.
[50:12] And when Abraham was 90 years old and
[50:15] nine 99 years old. So here we go with
[50:19] old age, right?
[50:21] Abraham was really old.
[50:25] But B said he was called at first when
[50:28] he was 75, Sarah 65, right? Amen. And
[50:33] here 25 years later, God speaks to him
[50:37] again. And the Lord appeared to Abraham
[50:40] and said unto him,"I am the Almighty
[50:43] God." Remember, Brother Brandon, we
[50:44] interpret that, and I'll read that here
[50:46] in a minute. Amen. What that Almighty
[50:48] God meant. Walk before me and be thou
[50:50] perfect, and I will make a my covenant
[50:53] between me and thee, and will multiply
[50:56] thee exceedingly. Amen.
[51:00] Praise the Lord.
[51:03] And let's just go to verse 10. This is
[51:06] my covenant which ye shall keep between
[51:08] me and you and thy seed after thee
[51:10] forever. Every manch child among you
[51:12] shall be circumcised and you shall
[51:14] circumcise the flesh of your foreskin
[51:16] and it shall be a token of the covenant
[51:18] between me and you. Amen. But Abraham
[51:22] said that that their covenant that token
[51:25] Amen. circumcision was a covenant. Amen.
[51:27] And it represented the Holy Spirit to
[51:31] us. Ain't that right? The Holy Spirit is
[51:33] the token in our lives. Amen. That God
[51:36] has made a covenant with us. Amen. And
[51:38] it's an unconditional covenant. How many
[51:40] knows that? Amen. Now, one more
[51:43] scripture I want to go way back in
[51:47] uh Romans 5. Romans 5.
[51:57] Let's go to chapter 4 first. We'll do a
[52:01] little bit of reading here. Chapter 4.
[52:04] And verse 17, as it is written, I have
[52:06] made thee a father of many nations
[52:09] before him whom he believed, even God,
[52:11] who quickenth the dead, and callth the
[52:14] things which be not as though they were.
[52:16] Who against hope believed in hope, that
[52:18] he might become the father of many
[52:20] nations, according to that which was
[52:23] spoken, so shall thy seed be. And being
[52:27] not weak in faith, he considered not his
[52:29] own body now dead when he was hundred
[52:32] years old, neither the deadness of
[52:34] Sarah's womb. And he staggered not at
[52:37] the promise of God through unbelief, but
[52:39] was strong in faith, giving God the
[52:42] glory. And being fully persuaded that
[52:44] what he had promised, he was able to do.
[52:47] Now, we're going to jump down to verse
[52:50] uh chapter 5, verse six. Just one verse
[52:53] that I want to pull out of here. For
[52:55] when we were yet without strength, in
[52:58] due time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[53:01] Amen. May God add his blessings to the
[53:03] reading of the word. Amen. You can be
[53:05] seated this morning. Now, this is where,
[53:09] you know, the prophet of God brought to
[53:11] our attention that when Paul mentions
[53:14] Abraham in the New Testament, he didn't
[53:17] mention any of Abraham's faults.
[53:21] Amen.
[53:23] Now, how many knows Abraham he had, you
[53:26] know, and and and this is the area I
[53:28] won't cover too much, but I want to
[53:29] cover just a little bit because brother
[53:31] Abandon, of course, we know that Abraham
[53:33] is the father of the faith. He's
[53:34] considered to be the father of the
[53:36] faith. And it says another place that
[53:38] Abraham is every one of our father.
[53:41] Amen. We're his children, so to speak.
[53:43] Ain't that right? So, that's why he has
[53:45] such an important role, amen, in our
[53:47] lives and why it's so important that we
[53:49] are children of Abraham through faith.
[53:51] We are the seed of Abraham. Of course,
[53:54] uh over in Galatians, Paul talks much
[53:56] about it, how that, you know, we by
[53:58] faith are the children of Abraham. Amen.
[54:01] So, we are Abraham's children. And God
[54:03] waited until he was very, very old
[54:05] before he ever called him. And we know
[54:07] that he called him. And brother Bam
[54:09] mentions it. I love it because he says
[54:11] when God called Abraham, he called him
[54:14] unconditionally.
[54:15] And it was he called him by grace.
[54:20] How many knows that Noah was called by
[54:22] grace. He found favor in the eyes of
[54:24] God. It was not something that Noah did.
[54:27] It was not something that Abraham did or
[54:30] deserved.
[54:31] Nothing special about him. Ain't that
[54:33] right? Nothing special about Abraham
[54:35] except that God chose Abraham.
[54:39] And when he chose Abraham, you know, it
[54:42] made all the difference in the world.
[54:46] Amen. How many this morning, if you'll
[54:47] read between the lines, how many
[54:49] thankful that God called you.
[54:53] There was millions and billions of
[54:55] people out there that you know you know
[54:57] that that God didn't call but he called
[55:00] you. If if you had that in your heart,
[55:02] if there's something down in your heart
[55:04] and your soul, amen, that know that
[55:07] there's more to life than just all these
[55:09] other things and God pulled you to
[55:12] himself. No, no, man. No man comes to me
[55:15] except my father draw him. So if that
[55:18] drawing was in your heart and in your
[55:20] soul, you're a blessed person.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; You know, we know that Adam, he was
[55:26] made, he had a covenant with God. He was
[55:28] in a covenant with God. And that
[55:30] covenant was not unconditional. It's if
[55:33] you don't eat of that tree, Amen. then
[55:35] you'll live forever. But if you eat of
[55:37] it, you at that day you will die. Amen.
[55:40] And we know man always, brother B says,
[55:42] man always breaks his covenant with God.
[55:46] How many would this morning, if I was to
[55:48] make a covenant with God, God, if I
[55:49] never make a mistake again, can can I be
[55:51] saved? How many would want to make a a
[55:54] covenant with God like that?
[55:56] Lord, if I don't never do anything wrong
[55:58] again, God, I believe I'll be saved. You
[56:00] know, I promise I'll never mess up.
[56:05] You'd be pretty dumb to make a statement
[56:06] like that, wouldn't you? That's right.
[56:08] Because why? You're You know, we already
[56:10] are are are have been told by the
[56:13] prophet, as long as you're in this
[56:14] flesh, you'll make mistakes.
[56:16] You're not going to be perfect till you
[56:18] get out of here. So don't make covenant.
[56:20] And even yesterday listening man was
[56:23] saying he says you know God we don't
[56:25] want your justice
[56:27] cuz if we got his justice there would
[56:30] none of us be able to stand but we want
[56:32] his mercy.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what God does. He gives
[56:36] us mercy. He gives us grace.
[56:40] That's what we want by God's grace. And
[56:42] you know Abraham we all know we'll just
[56:44] bring it up a little bit. You know, the
[56:45] first thing he did was take lot along.
[56:48] Amen. And I think in 1965, brother
[56:51] Benham preached a message called God's
[56:53] word calls for a total separation from
[56:55] unbelief.
[56:58] Amen. Another place he says, you know,
[57:01] Abraham was never completely blessed
[57:04] until he fully obeyed the word of God.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Fully obeyed the word of God. Now, as we
[57:11] get older,
[57:14] here we go.
[57:16] We get set in our ways,
[57:19] don't we? Amen. It's like concrete that
[57:23] hardens.
[57:25] Amen. I told brother my wife on the way
[57:28] to church, I says, you know, when you
[57:30] get old, you know, when you're old,
[57:33] you're about done.
[57:36] She didn't like that too well.
[57:40] What do you mean? You're about done.
[57:45] You know, but you know what I thought? I
[57:47] thought, yeah, your life is about done,
[57:50] but God help us. I hope that you are
[57:54] also that God is about finished working
[57:56] on you.
[57:58] That you're about ready to graduate,
[58:00] that you are come to the place to where
[58:02] you're ready to go home.
[58:05] You're ready to die. She didn't like
[58:07] that too well. ready to die. I said,
[58:10] "That's right." Because guess what? I
[58:11] don't care if you're young or old. But
[58:13] Bam said, "You're not fit to live until
[58:15] you're ready to die."
[58:17] &gt;&gt; How many know you're not really ready to
[58:19] live until you are at the place that you
[58:21] can say, "Lord, I'm ready to go.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; If I die before I come out of this
[58:26] service, if I have a heart attack or
[58:28] anything, I am ready to go."
[58:31] And we as older people, we ought to be
[58:33] mature. Ain't that right? We ought to be
[58:35] mature. But you know what? If we have
[58:37] some of Abraham, he was old and that
[58:39] don't mean he was perfect. He wasn't
[58:40] perfect in his old age. He had all kinds
[58:43] of mistakes. He had failures. He had a
[58:45] lot of unbelief in his life.
[58:51] I mean, know sure he did. Why? He didn't
[58:53] obey. God said, "Separate yourself."
[58:56] Brother Bam says until he separated
[58:57] himself from Lot, he was never blessed.
[59:00] And God brought, and this is a real good
[59:02] point that I've always taught in this
[59:04] before, anytime I go talking about this,
[59:06] is that whenever he had that unbelief in
[59:08] his life, God brought trials, God
[59:11] brought tribulation into their life. And
[59:14] he caused the herdsmen of Lot and the
[59:16] herdsmen of Abraham, Amen, to have a
[59:19] problem at the water. And at the well,
[59:21] they had strife amongst each other.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many know if If brothers
[59:30] aren't right, if somebody not right with
[59:32] God, you're going to have strife.
[59:34] There's going to be problems there.
[59:38] Amen.
[59:40] And God has a way of getting us and
[59:43] getting rid of get rid of our unbelief.
[59:46] Getting us to separate from unbelief.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank God he don't just ride
[59:53] us off.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; I mean, glad for that. He doesn't quit
[59:58] on us.
[1:00:00] Let me say this. We get set in our way.
[1:00:02] As we get older, we get set in our ways.
[1:00:05] We're like concrete that hardens. Amen.
[1:00:08] When you're 16, 17, 18. Amen. The young
[1:00:10] people right now, they're still soft.
[1:00:12] Their hearts are soft. Amen. And I had
[1:00:15] that scripture wrote down that brother
[1:00:16] Brian mentioned about, you know, he gave
[1:00:18] took out the heart of stone and he gives
[1:00:20] them a heart of flesh. Because we older
[1:00:22] folks, we have a way. We have a tendency
[1:00:25] if we aren't careful to get hearts that
[1:00:27] are a little bit hardened.
[1:00:30] Even our hearts harden sometimes. We
[1:00:33] don't have feelings like we used to
[1:00:35] have. We don't have the tenderness of
[1:00:38] God anymore like we used to.
[1:00:41] Amen.
[1:00:44] Amen. And we need a tender heart. Amen.
[1:00:47] And I want to tell you something that it
[1:00:49] doesn't matter what age you are. Amen.
[1:00:52] Sometimes if we're not molded and shaped
[1:00:54] the way that we're supposed to be.
[1:00:57] Amen. If we still have unbelief
[1:00:59] somewhere in our hearts and lives, God
[1:01:01] has to break us down.
[1:01:04] He has to reshape us. He's got to take
[1:01:06] us back to the potter's house. He has to
[1:01:09] let trials, tribulation, whatever it
[1:01:11] might be, come back upon you. Amen. To
[1:01:14] reshape you. Maybe you didn't handle a
[1:01:16] situation the way that you ought to.
[1:01:18] Guess what? God is going to bring it
[1:01:20] around again.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that next time you'll handle it
[1:01:24] the way that you're supposed to handle
[1:01:25] it. The way that you act so that you're
[1:01:28] the way you're supposed to act.
[1:01:31] Amen.
[1:01:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:36] Why? Because we must be no matter what.
[1:01:38] And you know, you get
[1:01:41] here here we go. You get some of our
[1:01:43] sisters. You get women. You get some
[1:01:45] women. Hello.
[1:01:48] Amen. When they get a little bit older,
[1:01:50] they can be snappy.
[1:01:53] They can be grumpy.
[1:01:55] They can be very nice, but it don't take
[1:01:57] much. And they'll let you have it full
[1:02:00] both barrels.
[1:02:02] Why? Because they put up with a lot.
[1:02:05] Amen. I know. Cuz my wife, she's a
[1:02:08] little bit that way.
[1:02:11] That's right. can be nice as can be, but
[1:02:13] she's had to put up with me all her
[1:02:15] life. And that has caused her to be able
[1:02:17] to just snap a little bit.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:22] I'll be out there doing this, that, or
[1:02:24] the other, and she wants something done.
[1:02:25] Hey, when did I get mine done? Why does
[1:02:27] everybody else get theirs first? Uh oh,
[1:02:31] I'm waiting for it this afternoon.
[1:02:34] But why? Because she's waited all of her
[1:02:36] life, maybe been bat way too much.
[1:02:39] Hello. You can get grouchy. You can get
[1:02:42] snappy. You can get that way because of
[1:02:44] the things that you've went through.
[1:02:47] Amen. A lot of people when you get
[1:02:48] older, let me tell you something. It's
[1:02:50] much easier to have a frown on your
[1:02:52] face. And you got to watch it because
[1:02:54] that's the devil's doing.
[1:02:58] It's the devil's doing to make you
[1:03:00] crabby, to make you snappy, to make you
[1:03:02] irritable, to make you impatient.
[1:03:06] Amen.
[1:03:08] God wants you full of joy.
[1:03:11] Okay, we'll get back up on that in just
[1:03:13] a minute.
[1:03:15] Praise the Lord. I like what we read
[1:03:19] here in
[1:03:22] Romans. But let me let me just read you
[1:03:23] a quote on brother Ben, what he said
[1:03:25] about Al Shadi.
[1:03:27] Amen.
[1:03:33] First of all,
[1:03:37] it's hard. It's harder
[1:03:40] because Abraham, he had lost his
[1:03:42] strength. Can you imagine how feeble a
[1:03:45] Abraham must have been at 90 years old?
[1:03:50] 90 years old. His wife, you know, and
[1:03:53] and God letting it go on, promise him a
[1:03:55] child. And it goes on and on and on. All
[1:03:57] these years of waiting
[1:04:02] He was weak. But you know how many knows
[1:04:04] that God is our strength giver?
[1:04:10] He is the one that renews our strength
[1:04:13] and our youth.
[1:04:16] Amen.
[1:04:19] Brother Bam says it this way. He says,
[1:04:20] "Now in the 17th chapter of Genesis, he
[1:04:22] appeared in the name of El Shadi." El
[1:04:25] Shadi in the Hebrew means breast or
[1:04:27] breasted one like a mother with a baby
[1:04:30] having a baby. He says, "I am El Shadi.
[1:04:33] I am Almighty God." And yet you're old.
[1:04:36] Your strength is gone.
[1:04:39] Sarah's womb is dead. She's 90. Little
[1:04:42] old grandma like that. A great great
[1:04:45] grandma 90 years old. She's awful old.
[1:04:48] The people's laughing at you and making
[1:04:50] fun of you. But I'm the breast of God.
[1:04:52] Breasted God. look at a like a mother,
[1:04:56] her sickly, fretting baby. Now, when the
[1:04:59] baby's all weak and run down, the
[1:05:00] strength is gone. The mother pulls her
[1:05:02] up to her bosom, and the child nurses
[1:05:04] his strength from the mother. This
[1:05:07] mother's strength becomes the child's
[1:05:09] strength as it draws it from her. Amen.
[1:05:14] The Bible says, "For when you and when
[1:05:16] we were yet without strength, in due
[1:05:18] time, Christ died for us."
[1:05:22] Amen. How many believe that it's because
[1:05:24] Calvary.
[1:05:25] Amen. Because of Calvary, we have
[1:05:28] strength this morning.
[1:05:31] We were without strength. Where would we
[1:05:33] be this morning if it wasn't for
[1:05:34] Calvary?
[1:05:37] Amen.
[1:05:40] Years I spent in vanity and pride,
[1:05:42] knowing not my Lord was crucified. Amen.
[1:05:48] Amen. But we thank God for Calvary.
[1:05:51] Calvary. Amen. Praise the Lord. I was
[1:05:55] going to title this the purpose of
[1:05:56] Calvary. Amen. But I retitled it
[1:06:00] strength through Calvary.
[1:06:02] Calvary. Amen. Through Calvary, we get
[1:06:05] strength.
[1:06:06] Amen. We have no strength outside of
[1:06:08] Calvary. Praise the Lord. Draws. He her
[1:06:13] strength becomes his strength. The
[1:06:16] baby's strength. That's right. And so he
[1:06:19] said, Abraham, you're old. You're past
[1:06:21] the age. is past the age, but I have to
[1:06:25] bless her through you so you can lo lean
[1:06:28] on my bosom and keep nursing. Amen.
[1:06:31] Hallelujah. And I'll give you your
[1:06:32] strong strength and draw it out. Amen.
[1:06:36] Listen, he says, not just one breast,
[1:06:38] but two breasts, New Testament, the Old
[1:06:41] Testament. I mean, that's where we get
[1:06:43] our strength.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for our transgression,
[1:06:47] and by his stripes, we were healed.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So he says it
[1:06:54] again. Amen.
[1:06:57] See, he's al shi tonight. He changes
[1:06:59] not. And his covenant people has the
[1:07:02] same privilege to draw from the same
[1:07:04] resource that father Abraham had to draw
[1:07:07] from because God swore by the same
[1:07:09] covenant that he'd give us the promise.
[1:07:11] Hallelujah. Oh my. There you are.
[1:07:13] There's where my hope is built on.
[1:07:15] Nothing less than Jesus blood and
[1:07:17] righteousness. When all my soul gives
[1:07:20] way, when all around my soul gives way,
[1:07:22] he is my hope and stay.
[1:07:25] Amen. Now listen. So take them into your
[1:07:28] heart tonight and just start drawing
[1:07:30] from them. God, you promised it.
[1:07:33] Tomorrow, I don't care how I feel, what
[1:07:36] you look like. Glory, I'm drawing from
[1:07:38] that promise. Watch how strength begin
[1:07:40] to renew. Amen. How things begin to
[1:07:44] straighten up. How arms begin to move.
[1:07:47] Eyes begin to brighten. Hearts begin to
[1:07:50] be normal. The breast of God I'm
[1:07:52] drawing. I don't care how I feel or what
[1:07:54] I look like. I am drawing from his
[1:07:56] breast. Lord, you promise that I'm the
[1:07:59] seed of Abraham. I'm your child and I'm
[1:08:02] drawing from this promise. It's thus
[1:08:04] says the Lord. Oh my, I believe you. And
[1:08:08] then the next day I get sicker than I am
[1:08:10] ever was. I'm still drawing.
[1:08:14] I stagger not at the promise of God
[1:08:16] through unbelief, but strong in faith,
[1:08:18] giving glory to God for the promise that
[1:08:20] he said he would do. Amen. You can call
[1:08:22] me holy roller, so you might as well get
[1:08:24] started if you are. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:08:27] But he listen what he says. He didn't do
[1:08:29] no good as long as Lot hung around.
[1:08:31] That's right. He had to get rid of old
[1:08:33] Lot. He had called him to separate
[1:08:35] himself when he took Lot with them. And
[1:08:39] Lot was half backslitting all the time
[1:08:41] anyway. And after Sodom and Gomorrah,
[1:08:43] all this happened, he says, "Then God
[1:08:45] appeared to Abraham and says,"Now come
[1:08:47] out and look around and see what you
[1:08:49] own." Amen. Oh, I like that. Come out
[1:08:52] here and look it over. Walk from the
[1:08:54] east to the west.
[1:08:57] Amen. How many loves the different
[1:08:58] preachers that come through and they'll
[1:09:00] show you this is yours and that is yours
[1:09:03] and this is yours and that is yours.
[1:09:05] Look over the whole land. Look, east,
[1:09:08] west, north, south. Every promise in the
[1:09:11] book is mine. Every chapter, every
[1:09:13] verse, every line that gives me
[1:09:15] strength. You're not on your own. You've
[1:09:18] been bought with a price. You didn't
[1:09:20] start in this race. He started this work
[1:09:22] in you and he is able to perform it.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; That gives me strength. Amen. Don't look
[1:09:28] at your faults. Amen. Your faults are
[1:09:30] nothing but lies.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that your
[1:09:35] sickness is nothing but a lie? Don't
[1:09:37] look at that. Look at the word of God.
[1:09:40] I love that. Don't you?
[1:09:44] Amen.
[1:09:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:52] Listen, here's just a quote that I was I
[1:09:54] was listening. What it takes to
[1:09:55] overcome. This has to do with with
[1:09:58] accepting what uh uh God has for you.
[1:10:02] God heals you. His promise says he does.
[1:10:05] So, you have a right to it. Do you
[1:10:07] accept it? Do you accept your healing? I
[1:10:09] don't care how crippled you are, how
[1:10:11] blind you are, or whatever is wrong with
[1:10:14] you. I don't care. Stand to your feet
[1:10:16] right now, he says, and accept your
[1:10:17] healing on the basis of God's word.
[1:10:20] Amen. If you believe it. Praise the
[1:10:22] Lord. Listen, maybe it's just one time
[1:10:26] of nursing. You didn't get enough
[1:10:28] strength. You stay there. Draw from him
[1:10:31] from him until you are walking until the
[1:10:35] cancer is gone.
[1:10:37] refuse to see cancer. Refuse to see
[1:10:40] anything that's contrary to his word.
[1:10:43] It's not so.
[1:10:47] Everything like Jonah, they're lying
[1:10:49] vanities. I don't even see them. I won't
[1:10:52] recognize them. No sir, I see what God
[1:10:55] said. He says, I don't see the Amorites.
[1:10:58] I don't see the graveyard. Don't see
[1:11:01] those things. See the promise of God.
[1:11:03] God promised it. Amen.
[1:11:06] I know that death has got to strike
[1:11:09] everyone. Death comes to us all. Amen.
[1:11:13] But sometimes just because of unbelief,
[1:11:16] we give up and go to a premature grave.
[1:11:20] Amen. I may be getting old and I may be
[1:11:23] going to the grave, but I don't want to
[1:11:25] go to the grave prematurely. Do you just
[1:11:28] because I can't take and claim the
[1:11:29] promises of God?
[1:11:32] How many wants their full life?
[1:11:34] That's what I want every day that God
[1:11:36] has for me. I don't want to go to a
[1:11:38] premature grave. And you can if you
[1:11:40] don't grab a hold of faith sometimes.
[1:11:43] Praise the Lord. That's what he said. I
[1:11:45] like when he I I thought that was good.
[1:11:48] Amen. God don't want us to do that. He
[1:11:51] wants us to trust him and believe him
[1:11:52] and say it say so and stay on it. Praise
[1:11:56] the Lord. And stay on it.
[1:12:01] Amen.
[1:12:04] now.
[1:12:07] But it takes faith
[1:12:10] in the promised land of God, God's
[1:12:14] promised land. Amen.
[1:12:18] Let's talk about where we get our
[1:12:20] strength from. And it's from Calvary,
[1:12:22] isn't it?
[1:12:26] Wasn't for Calvary, I wouldn't be
[1:12:28] standing here. You wouldn't be there.
[1:12:31] You'd still be some gentile, as the
[1:12:33] prophet of God said, with a club on your
[1:12:35] back and h carrying some idols or
[1:12:38] something. We'd still be a denomination.
[1:12:41] We'd be out there confusion somewhere if
[1:12:43] it wasn't for Calvary and for the grace
[1:12:45] of God. Amen. I believe it's all hinges
[1:12:48] on Calvary. Paul said, "I come among
[1:12:51] you. I don't want to know anything
[1:12:52] except Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[1:12:55] Because that's where our strength comes
[1:12:57] from.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to this. I'm going to reach
[1:13:00] you some more. That's the way devil will
[1:13:03] do. He'll let you build up, get build up
[1:13:05] like he did Shamgar a little bit and
[1:13:06] then come and try to knock the props out
[1:13:09] from under you. He says, "And the reason
[1:13:11] he does is you let him do it." See, he's
[1:13:13] nothing but a bluff. How many believes
[1:13:15] that at Calvary, Amen, the strength of
[1:13:18] the devil was stripped from him.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; The power of the devil was taken from
[1:13:23] him.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. He ain't got no rights
[1:13:26] anymore at all. If you're a child of God
[1:13:29] and God has called you, if you're one of
[1:13:32] his, you've got every right.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; You've got every right that was lost in
[1:13:36] the Garden of Eden.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got the right to speak what
[1:13:40] God lays on your heart to speak. And it
[1:13:43] shall be so.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; The devil ain't got no rights.
[1:13:48] He's nothing but a bluff. He has no
[1:13:51] legal right. And if you got an
[1:13:53] experience of God, of the resurrection
[1:13:55] of Jesus Christ, he stripped Satan of
[1:13:57] every privilege he had. He robbed him of
[1:14:00] everything. He took it away from him.
[1:14:01] Yes, sir. He robbed him and stripped him
[1:14:03] and give the power to the church. Give
[1:14:06] strength to the church.
[1:14:08] Amen. Because why I want to say in the
[1:14:10] Old Testament, all those people, they
[1:14:13] would sacrifice animals and and sheep
[1:14:16] and lambs and so forth because it
[1:14:18] represented the lamb that was to come.
[1:14:20] But they would go out there and do the
[1:14:22] same thing again and again and again.
[1:14:25] And all they could do was wish they
[1:14:28] could overcome,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; wish they had strength to live
[1:14:32] different.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, they had a lot of
[1:14:36] wishbone.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Hello. Lot of wishbone and not backbone.
[1:14:43] God wants us to have backbone, not
[1:14:45] wishbone.
[1:14:47] [Applause]
[1:14:48] You're going to love this. Listen.
[1:14:51] Praise the Lord. Stripped him of his
[1:14:52] power. Now he says, "Go do the things
[1:14:55] that I did." Yes, sir. He took the sword
[1:14:58] out of the Satan's hand and put it in
[1:15:01] your hand.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The chains that the devil had on
[1:15:05] your leg. You took it off and you put it
[1:15:08] on his leg. Now I bind you. You've had
[1:15:11] me bound. Now I'm not. Now I bind you.
[1:15:16] Hallelujah.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You robbed me of my
[1:15:21] joy. You robbed me of my smile. You
[1:15:24] robbed me of my happiness. But now I'm
[1:15:26] taking it back.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; You got every right
[1:15:31] to live in that place, to arrive at that
[1:15:33] place.
[1:15:35] Amen. Strength. Man, you shall receive
[1:15:39] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[1:15:42] upon you. How many believe the church of
[1:15:44] the living God, they got power?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; They have strength.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; How many times, brother Brandon preached
[1:15:50] about Samson, where has thy strength
[1:15:52] gone?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He was trying to talk
[1:15:55] to the Pentecostals. He says, you know,
[1:15:57] they were like Samson. They had been
[1:16:00] they let the world come in.
[1:16:02] They let this come in. They let that
[1:16:04] come in.
[1:16:08] Here it goes. Just can I speak what
[1:16:10] comes to my mind?
[1:16:13] Was there a time in your life?
[1:16:17] Was there a time in your life you can
[1:16:18] look back and say, you know, I used to
[1:16:21] be closer to God than what I am now.
[1:16:29] If you say yes to that, then you're
[1:16:31] backslid.
[1:16:34] Is that right? You're backslid
[1:16:36] because you was closer to God at one
[1:16:39] point than what you are now.
[1:16:46] I'm a little bit quiet. I just want that
[1:16:48] to sink in.
[1:16:52] You shouldn't be
[1:16:54] this morning. Right now,
[1:16:58] right at this moment, you should be as
[1:17:00] close to God as you ever was.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; You should be as filled with the power
[1:17:05] of God as what you ever was.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we're going forward, not
[1:17:11] backwards.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to be like Samson
[1:17:15] that lost his power because he let the
[1:17:18] world come in. Some pretty looking
[1:17:21] woman. Is that right? That took his
[1:17:24] power away from him.
[1:17:26] Amen.
[1:17:28] But I like the thing about Samson. Ain't
[1:17:30] that right? The thing about Samson, he
[1:17:32] was God's man and his hair grew back.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; He repented. He got right. You might be
[1:17:38] backslid. You may not be where you are,
[1:17:40] but guess what? You ain't got to stay
[1:17:42] that way. You can have the power of God
[1:17:44] again. You can have that same strength
[1:17:46] that you had before.
[1:17:51] How many believe that? We're thankful
[1:17:54] for God's grace, aren't we? See, he
[1:17:56] giveth power to the faint. Isaiah said
[1:17:58] in Isaiah 40 verse 29, he giveth power
[1:18:02] to the faint.
[1:18:04] Abraham had he couldn't do nothing.
[1:18:08] He couldn't have no babies. He couldn't
[1:18:10] have any children.
[1:18:12] He was pa past sexual desire. Well, even
[1:18:17] Sarah said, "What are we going to do?
[1:18:19] Have pleasure again." She thought it was
[1:18:21] funny.
[1:18:23] But what? God gave him strength.
[1:18:27] Isn't this something how I'm not going
[1:18:30] to read it, but Aimilec when when when
[1:18:32] Sarah and Abraham went down to Ger,
[1:18:35] Aimilec
[1:18:37] took Sarah and was going to marry her.
[1:18:40] Isn't that right? He had taken her
[1:18:44] and brother Bab said that Sarah was
[1:18:46] turned back to a young woman again.
[1:18:49] Is that right? How did he know? Well, a
[1:18:52] lot of critical people might say, "How
[1:18:54] did he know he was a prophet? If he can
[1:18:57] show you the color of Eve's hair, he can
[1:18:59] show you Sarah."
[1:19:02] And he picked that up. He says, "Can you
[1:19:03] imagine an 85y old woman, old and
[1:19:06] decrepit, and the king said, "Boy, isn't
[1:19:10] she a beauty queen? I want her from my
[1:19:12] wife."
[1:19:13] I don't think so. No, she was beautiful.
[1:19:18] Hello.
[1:19:20] Why? because God did that. Showing what
[1:19:22] God's going to do to you and to me. How
[1:19:25] many believes that we're getting a body
[1:19:27] change. We're going to get young again.
[1:19:31] We're going to turn back young again.
[1:19:35] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:39] Power to the faint. To them that have no
[1:19:41] might, he increases strength.
[1:19:45] Amen.
[1:19:47] Even the youth shall faint and be weary,
[1:19:49] and the young men shall utterly fall.
[1:19:52] But they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:19:55] renew
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; their strength
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; or renew their youth.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Most old
[1:20:06] folks walk around like this.
[1:20:12] Sad,
[1:20:14] crabby.
[1:20:16] Huh?
[1:20:19] weak,
[1:20:23] but he don't want you that way. No, he
[1:20:26] wants you lively. How many believes God
[1:20:28] wants a lively church?
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; We may be the older folks here this
[1:20:32] morning, but that don't mean we have
[1:20:34] little youth in our lives. We sure do.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; We can feel as good as a young person.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; You don't think so? What about that old
[1:20:42] Pentecostal preacher, 80ome years old?
[1:20:45] Amen. had to have somebody help him up
[1:20:47] there, you know. But you get him under
[1:20:49] the awaiting upon the Lord a little bit.
[1:20:51] Woo! Hallelujah. Click his feet. They
[1:20:53] got him. You ain't got nothing room for
[1:20:55] me to preach up here.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Why? He renewed his youth.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; How many believe you can renew your
[1:21:02] youth?
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; You can feel young again.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because this old man might perish.
[1:21:08] This just comes fresh. Paul said this,
[1:21:11] "While this old man f you know he may
[1:21:13] perish but the inward man is renewed day
[1:21:16] by day." How many is glad for that?
[1:21:19] Renewed.
[1:21:22] Hallelujah.
[1:21:24] They that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:21:26] their strength. They shall mount up with
[1:21:28] wings of eagles. They shall run and not
[1:21:31] be weary. They shall walk and not faint.
[1:21:36] How many knows that an eagle goes
[1:21:38] through a moping period?
[1:21:40] a midlife crisis.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. Sometimes we go through
[1:21:46] midlife crisis.
[1:21:48] We did.
[1:21:50] I know what a midlife crisis is.
[1:21:53] Lasts a long time, too, sometimes.
[1:21:55] It ain't no fun. God forbid anybody has
[1:21:58] it. Hello. I've watched many families
[1:22:02] fall apart in their midlife crisis.
[1:22:05] That's why I'd never be together again.
[1:22:07] That's sad. I don't like to see that.
[1:22:10] Amen.
[1:22:13] I'll just go ahead and say it. Sometimes
[1:22:14] relationships between a husband and man
[1:22:17] in a midlife time, sometimes you better
[1:22:19] renew that f that that love that you had
[1:22:21] for your wife. Hello. You better treat
[1:22:24] her like she was uh your little queen
[1:22:26] before you married her. That's right.
[1:22:29] And you better, you know, I don't care
[1:22:30] how ugly your husband is or how terrible
[1:22:32] your husband is or whatever it might be.
[1:22:34] You better start looking at him maybe
[1:22:36] like like it was before you got married.
[1:22:40] Amen.
[1:22:41] Or they'll both want somebody else.
[1:22:46] Come on, folks. That's way the world
[1:22:48] goes. You better stay close to God.
[1:22:52] That's right.
[1:22:54] Anyway, that's free.
[1:23:00] Amen.
[1:23:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:05] Okay.
[1:23:07] So that's right. They shall m up with
[1:23:10] wings and eagles. They shall run and not
[1:23:12] be weary. They shall walk and not faint.
[1:23:15] An eagle when he goes through that time,
[1:23:17] that moping period,
[1:23:19] that bad time of their life.
[1:23:23] Hello. What does it say? That other
[1:23:26] eagles will bring him food. They'll
[1:23:28] bring him meat. And what he does, he has
[1:23:30] to keep eating that meat. Keep eating
[1:23:32] that meat. Keep eating the word. Keep
[1:23:34] going to church anywhere, even if you
[1:23:36] don't feel like it.
[1:23:39] Hello. Eat that food. Eat that food
[1:23:41] until you beat them rough scales off of
[1:23:43] your mouth and everything else and off
[1:23:45] of your head.
[1:23:47] Hello. And eventually, guess what? That
[1:23:50] eagle's youth is renewed
[1:23:52] and it gets young again and it flies
[1:23:55] like never before.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that the way we want to be?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We want to soar higher than what
[1:24:02] we ever have.
[1:24:05] Amen. Renew
[1:24:08] our strength and claim our God-given
[1:24:10] rights. Amen. All right, back to our
[1:24:14] thought.
[1:24:15] Think about this.
[1:24:24] Listen.
[1:24:27] Brother Bam says, "I've used to often
[1:24:29] times wonder what's the matter with the
[1:24:30] Christian church. They're so scared of
[1:24:33] things. Why? You've got nothing to be
[1:24:35] scared about."
[1:24:37] The first word nearly comes out of Jesus
[1:24:39] Christ after the resurrection was fear
[1:24:41] not. Don't fear. Don't be scared.
[1:24:46] There ain't nothing going to happen.
[1:24:48] Nothing can happen. Nothing can bother a
[1:24:50] Christian. Amen. Not even death itself
[1:24:53] could touch a Christian. He that
[1:24:55] believeth my words and believeth on him
[1:24:57] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[1:24:58] shall not come into contamination, but
[1:25:01] has passed from death unto life. Death
[1:25:04] itself has no reign over a Christian.
[1:25:06] Christ died in ourstead. How marvelous.
[1:25:10] What a faith it ought to build up into
[1:25:12] people. Amen. Amen. Sometimes that'll
[1:25:15] tow the mark. You'll never get nowhere
[1:25:19] by being a jellyfish Christian. No, sir.
[1:25:23] Did you ever see a jellyfish? You just
[1:25:26] hit him and he splatters all over.
[1:25:30] Isn't that them jellyfish that give you
[1:25:31] all the You never want to get stung by
[1:25:33] them things and get them on you.
[1:25:37] That's about the way it is in church.
[1:25:38] You got somebody in church that's
[1:25:40] jellyfish. You don't rub up close too
[1:25:42] close to them. You're going to get some
[1:25:45] bad stuff on you. Amen.
[1:25:49] The crabs. And you know what usually
[1:25:50] gets them? the crabs and things along
[1:25:52] the seashore gets him. Comes up with his
[1:25:54] pincher and cuts him in two and takes
[1:25:56] him down. That's right.
[1:26:00] Because jellyfish just lays brother. He
[1:26:02] says what we need is Christians, not
[1:26:04] jellyfish, but with a backbone that'll
[1:26:06] stand. I don't mean to fuss with the
[1:26:08] people, but stand for your Godgiven
[1:26:12] rights that Christ died for. How many
[1:26:14] believes that you've got a right to joy?
[1:26:17] You've got a right to peace. You got a
[1:26:19] right to everything that Christ died
[1:26:20] for, but you got to fight for every
[1:26:23] inch. This promised land is north, east,
[1:26:25] west, and south. This promised land, he
[1:26:27] says it's all yours, but you got to
[1:26:30] fight every inch of the way.
[1:26:42] That's right. When you come to church,
[1:26:44] you got to fight not just to be a
[1:26:45] wallflower at church.
[1:26:48] Well, yeah. I'm sitting here and I'm
[1:26:50] hearing it, but I ain't really all here.
[1:26:53] You know, I don't feel like saying amen
[1:26:55] or shouting or hallelujah. I just I'm
[1:26:57] not in the mood today.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:27:04] Why? You got to fight through all that.
[1:27:06] We got to fight through being stale.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; We got to fight to not be dead in
[1:27:11] church.
[1:27:13] You got to fight to get something
[1:27:15] sometime because the devil be sitting
[1:27:17] there while you're listening to the
[1:27:19] preacher and he's got giving you all
[1:27:21] kinds of thoughts in your mind
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; that's keeping you distracted. I wonder
[1:27:26] if I'm talking to anybody this morning.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He tries to get you
[1:27:30] distracted. Get you to thinking
[1:27:31] somewhere else. Your job or cares or or
[1:27:34] problems or or faults or failures or
[1:27:36] whatever. He'll put that in you to keep
[1:27:39] you from getting something. Why? You got
[1:27:41] to fight your way every inch of it. But
[1:27:43] I like this that when you finally get
[1:27:45] your foot over there, keep your foot
[1:27:47] over there. Don't let the devil push you
[1:27:49] back. Get it over there and say, "Amen,
[1:27:52] brother. Preach it." Hallelujah. We're
[1:27:54] going to have a good time in church this
[1:27:56] morning.
[1:27:58] [Applause]
[1:28:00] Hallelujah.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:05] Maybe you're old and formed and you just
[1:28:07] don't say amen in church. Well, maybe
[1:28:09] God has to reform you a little bit. A
[1:28:11] Christian ought to be able to punctuate
[1:28:13] every word of God with a amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah once in a while don't
[1:28:18] hurt
[1:28:19] just a little bit. He scream don't hurt.
[1:28:21] None neither. It don't bother me a bit.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; I was writing this and I said, "Can you
[1:28:28] imagine the devil wants to rob us of our
[1:28:30] joy? Can you imagine a church that's not
[1:28:32] lively? Can you imagine getting to
[1:28:34] heaven and the people aren't happy?
[1:28:37] Everybody's just dead over there.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; There's no joy. There's no shouting.
[1:28:42] There's not. Boy, that'd be a terrible
[1:28:43] heaven, wouldn't it?
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; No, there's going to be shouting.
[1:28:48] There's going to be praising God.
[1:28:50] There's going to be glory to God.
[1:28:51] There's going to be all of that
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; for what he did.
[1:28:57] And we are not just going to be in
[1:28:59] heaven. We're already in heavenly places
[1:29:02] in Christ Jesus right here this morning.
[1:29:10] All right, let me just pull up another
[1:29:12] quote right quick. I I
[1:29:17] like what he said. Now, remember,
[1:29:21] I believe that the Holy Spirit has
[1:29:23] plenty of emotion.
[1:29:25] Anything I can prove to you that
[1:29:27] anything hasn't got life is dead. And
[1:29:30] so, if the church hasn't got a little
[1:29:32] life, there's something wrong with the
[1:29:34] church. It needs a resurrection.
[1:29:37] So I believe that we have to have a
[1:29:38] little emotion. I see where in a
[1:29:41] basketball he goes through talking about
[1:29:42] a basketball game and if everybody sets
[1:29:44] up in the balcony and don't say nothing,
[1:29:45] he says, "Boy, this is a dead place."
[1:29:48] And he says, "Well, if our master is
[1:29:50] winning the fight, we can sure do a
[1:29:53] little cutting up once in a while."
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Once in a while, he says,
[1:29:59] you know, let him know that we
[1:30:01] appreciate the victory that he gives us.
[1:30:03] That's right. We don't want to be a have
[1:30:06] a dead meeting, a dead church. We want
[1:30:09] it alive with the spirit of God moving
[1:30:12] in a real sensible sane gospel way. Just
[1:30:17] performing signs and wonders and showing
[1:30:19] the signs of this Messiah in our midst.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; If your religion don't have a little
[1:30:25] emotion in it, maybe you ought to bury
[1:30:27] it. I believe he said one place.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:36] Amen.
[1:30:37] How many likes to feel like you're just
[1:30:39] half dead? Nobody likes that half dead
[1:30:42] feeling.
[1:30:46] That clock ain't going very fast. That's
[1:30:48] good.
[1:30:51] Amen.
[1:30:53] Praise the Lord. How many believes that
[1:30:54] God wants us to give us a backbone, not
[1:30:56] a wishbone?
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; We have to go in and possess the land
[1:31:00] that's ours.
[1:31:02] Amen. Now listen to what he says. He
[1:31:05] says not to fuss with people. Not that
[1:31:07] kind of backbone, but to stand for
[1:31:09] God-given rights that created Christ
[1:31:11] died for. Not pushed around. We don't
[1:31:14] have to be pushed around. No sir. We got
[1:31:16] an inheritance. And our inheritance
[1:31:18] belongs to us. It's your privilege to
[1:31:21] have anything that you inherited.
[1:31:24] Through accepting Jesus Christ and dying
[1:31:26] to yourself. How marvelous. Yes, sir.
[1:31:28] Satan said, he might say, "Well, I'll
[1:31:31] tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going
[1:31:33] to perhaps put a cancer on you. I'm
[1:31:36] going to depress you. I'm going to make
[1:31:38] your life miserable." Listen what he
[1:31:39] says. I'm going to tell you what I'm
[1:31:41] going to do. Brother Bam says, "No, you
[1:31:44] ain't going to do nothing."
[1:31:46] That's the way to talk back to him. Say,
[1:31:48] "I know my position in Christ, and you
[1:31:51] might as well get away. I ain't
[1:31:54] listening to you no more. I got an
[1:31:57] inheritance.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; How many believe God got an inheritance?
[1:32:01] Man, I'll tell you what. Jesus Christ
[1:32:03] died. Amen. Shall freely give you all
[1:32:06] things.
[1:32:08] Who shall say and lay anything at the
[1:32:10] charge of God's elect? It's Christ that
[1:32:12] died and is rose again. Amen. How shall
[1:32:16] he not with him give us freely all
[1:32:18] things?
[1:32:20] How many's glad that you didn't have to
[1:32:21] purchase this? Christ bought this for
[1:32:23] you.
[1:32:25] We have an inheritance.
[1:32:27] Amen.
[1:32:29] Not listening to that devil anymore. And
[1:32:32] we got a little deed to it. An abstract.
[1:32:35] Goes all the way back to Calvary. The
[1:32:38] day of Pentecost when he said the
[1:32:39] promises to you, to your children, to
[1:32:42] them that's far off, even as many as the
[1:32:44] Lord our God shall call. That's our
[1:32:47] abstract need.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he goes to talking about
[1:32:53] what? If you go home tonight, Amen. and
[1:32:56] there's a bunch of drunks in your house,
[1:32:58] hello, and they tell you, "Well, I got a
[1:33:01] right to be here. I am a human being."
[1:33:05] What are you going to do?
[1:33:08] Can we say this morning, let's not talk
[1:33:10] about going back to your house? How
[1:33:12] about if there's something in your life,
[1:33:15] in your heart, in your body that's not
[1:33:17] supposed to be there, ain't got no right
[1:33:19] to be there. How about taking the
[1:33:22] authority of the word and saying this
[1:33:24] morning I'm claiming my God-given rights
[1:33:27] and I'm kicking that thing out. Get out
[1:33:30] of my life, devil. You ain't got no
[1:33:32] rights here.
[1:33:35] That's the way to talk to him.
[1:33:39] Amen.
[1:33:41] See, I happen to believe that we are
[1:33:46] coming to where it's like building a
[1:33:49] house.
[1:33:50] We're coming to the finishing touches.
[1:33:52] Is that right? Some of the last things
[1:33:55] that you do is put the baseboard down,
[1:33:57] case out those windows,
[1:33:59] right? Maybe even after the carpet's
[1:34:02] down, all we lack is casing out the
[1:34:04] windows, putting the crown mold up and
[1:34:05] the baseboard and casing out the doors.
[1:34:08] And boy, that makes a huge difference.
[1:34:10] How many knows when those windows are
[1:34:12] not cased out, the baseboard ain't on
[1:34:13] there, and the crown mold ain't on
[1:34:15] there. It don't look so good yet. No,
[1:34:18] but you put that finishing touches and
[1:34:20] knit this the way that it's supposed to
[1:34:22] be. You take those little nail holes and
[1:34:24] you fill them with mud. Amen. Perhaps.
[1:34:25] And put a stain over or a painting.
[1:34:28] Amen. And that's what God is doing with
[1:34:29] you and I.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're old, if we're older
[1:34:33] people and that's the way where where we
[1:34:34] ought to be, let God put the finishing
[1:34:36] touches on you. Amen. Because when we
[1:34:40] go, we want to be ready to go. Ain't
[1:34:43] that right, young old be ready to go.
[1:34:46] The worst thing that can happen to you,
[1:34:48] brother Bam says, is to die without
[1:34:49] Christ. Die not being ready. That's the
[1:34:52] worst thing that can happen. He says,
[1:34:54] you know, whether you would be burned up
[1:34:56] in a trap car in a fire or the most
[1:34:59] terrible ways that you could think of
[1:35:01] dying. It's nothing compared to dying
[1:35:03] without Christ.
[1:35:06] Amen.
[1:35:07] So, I believe that, don't you? That God
[1:35:09] is putting his final finishing touches
[1:35:10] to the bride. Uh you look at the
[1:35:13] ministry overall,
[1:35:14] the preachers overall and tell them and
[1:35:16] seeing the faith that is being built in
[1:35:19] the church the word of God.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; I read that here two months ago I think
[1:35:24] it was brother Bam says before you ever
[1:35:26] see anything done before any miracle
[1:35:28] before any change of your body amen that
[1:35:30] you're claiming he says give God the
[1:35:32] praise for it anyway.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I seen there preaching that up at camp
[1:35:36] and putting that up there. He says
[1:35:37] before you see anything give God the
[1:35:39] glory anyway. Don't wait until something
[1:35:41] happens. Oh, yeah. When it happens, we
[1:35:43] get twice as happy. But we got to be
[1:35:45] happy beforehand and believe it. Give
[1:35:48] God the glory. Say, "God's got God's got
[1:35:50] this.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; It's already done. It's already done.
[1:35:55] The battle is over. The victory's been
[1:35:57] won."
[1:35:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:01] That's right.
[1:36:06] That's the law down here that says that
[1:36:08] you can prove it's your house. says,
[1:36:10] "Now, I'm going to take you prematurely.
[1:36:13] I'm going to do this." No, you're not.
[1:36:16] Amen. We got a title to this property of
[1:36:19] ours. That's right. Amen. Praise the
[1:36:22] Lord.
[1:36:26] God wants men and women who's got
[1:36:28] backbone instead of wishbone. When God
[1:36:30] says anything, we believe it. That's
[1:36:32] all. That settles it. So, if God makes
[1:36:35] it true, is that right? That makes it
[1:36:38] true. And I said, "There you are, Lord.
[1:36:40] You want somebody talking about the
[1:36:42] eagle that he saw being brave. He wasn't
[1:36:44] scared of him with the gun. You want
[1:36:47] somebody that'll really know what
[1:36:48] they're talking about and he's ready to
[1:36:50] stand for that's what's truth." A lot of
[1:36:53] people say, "Well, I accept my healing.
[1:36:54] I believe Jesus heals." All right. And
[1:36:56] the first little cramp that hits you,
[1:36:59] you're ready to give up.
[1:37:01] Oh my. You go and say, "I believe in the
[1:37:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost." And shout
[1:37:05] and dance in the church. And when you
[1:37:07] come to some critics, meet some critic
[1:37:09] out there on the street, you're as
[1:37:11] silent as a church mouse. That's right.
[1:37:14] Oh, brother, don't hold your peace.
[1:37:15] Scream it out. Like John the Baptist
[1:37:18] when that woman wasn't it wasn't right
[1:37:20] for that king to have her. Remember
[1:37:21] Herod or one of them said it ain't right
[1:37:23] for you to have her. And they it cost
[1:37:25] him his head. He says, "If it takes your
[1:37:27] head, be like John the Baptist." That's
[1:37:30] right. Stand for what's truth.
[1:37:33] Amen.
[1:37:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:52] What's that in your hand this afternoon?
[1:37:54] The doctor's done turned you down. You
[1:37:57] ain't got time to pedal around with that
[1:37:58] anymore. Get Christ. Whatever is in your
[1:38:01] hand, pick up the word of God that Jesus
[1:38:03] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:38:05] forever. and slay that thing and walk
[1:38:07] out. Amen. You say, "Well, brother
[1:38:09] Benham,
[1:38:11] you know, kind of whining." He says,
[1:38:13] "Yeah, you're too timid." That's what it
[1:38:16] is. That's exactly what's the matter.
[1:38:20] Amen. Then he goes, "Too timid." Talks
[1:38:22] about the football stadium. Ain't the
[1:38:24] size of the dog in the fight. Size of
[1:38:26] the fight in the dog. It ain't how timid
[1:38:28] you are, what you are, brother. Rise up.
[1:38:31] It ain't what you are. It's what Christ
[1:38:33] is that's in you. what the power of the
[1:38:35] Holy Ghost is. Amen.
[1:38:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:43] All right, we're going to skip over a
[1:38:45] lot of this here and we want to talk in
[1:38:48] closing. I want to talk about the
[1:38:52] crowning of our life. But every man
[1:38:54] makes a statement. How many Christians
[1:38:56] are in the way tonight in here that are
[1:38:59] happy that you started a long time ago?
[1:39:05] I'm happy that I started a long time
[1:39:09] ago.
[1:39:12] That's why. How many hands we got up?
[1:39:15] Started a long time ago. Raise them up
[1:39:17] high and everybody look around at those
[1:39:19] hands. Two in the back, one up here.
[1:39:24] Just the fact that you're here is a
[1:39:26] miracle. Ain't that right? Because I
[1:39:29] guarantee you, you've had to have fight
[1:39:30] many battles, many devils to be here
[1:39:33] this morning,
[1:39:34] still serving God.
[1:39:40] I don't even want to see the crowd that
[1:39:42] can't raise their hands that have left
[1:39:44] cro. It's much bigger
[1:39:48] fall by the wayside because they didn't
[1:39:50] have that root down on the inside of the
[1:39:52] inside.
[1:39:56] are happy started a long time ago done
[1:39:59] made your start and way down along the
[1:40:01] road still coming down towards the end I
[1:40:06] pray that God will crown your ministry
[1:40:13] whatever it is
[1:40:16] how many knows God has gifted us with
[1:40:18] something in life
[1:40:21] it may be a housewife
[1:40:25] Amen. Brother Bam said one place, he
[1:40:28] says, "You moms, you just have about a
[1:40:31] 25 year span right there that you're
[1:40:34] going to do your job, and that is to
[1:40:36] raise those children. Teach them, right?
[1:40:39] Is that right? That's your job. Once
[1:40:41] they're 18 and gone, you can still do
[1:40:44] what you can, but Amen. It changes."
[1:40:49] So that's your ministry. May God crown
[1:40:52] the mother's ministry
[1:40:55] with their children. Amen. I I I thought
[1:40:59] of something and I'll just bring it up
[1:41:01] because it comes to my mind.
[1:41:04] But
[1:41:06] Hadty Wright, remember Hatty Wright?
[1:41:12] We can we can say that Hattie Wright
[1:41:17] turned down
[1:41:19] $5 trillion
[1:41:22] for two souls.
[1:41:24] Her children's souls were worth more
[1:41:28] than one trillion.
[1:41:30] Because Brother Bam said, "You're poor.
[1:41:33] Maybe it's money, right? He says, "Poor,
[1:41:36] maybe you need financial." He says, "If
[1:41:38] it don't drop in your lap, I'm a false
[1:41:40] prophet." I mean, believe she could have
[1:41:41] asked for a trillion dollars.
[1:41:44] Sure,
[1:41:46] but she wasn't interested. Quiet because
[1:41:48] those souls are worth way more than a
[1:41:50] trillion dollars. It's worth 10,000
[1:41:54] worlds.
[1:41:57] How do do we all feel that way? That's
[1:41:59] why we're so happy to have our children
[1:42:01] at camp. Ain't that right?
[1:42:04] When they come back, when your children
[1:42:06] raise, I believe brother Bam said one of
[1:42:08] brother one of the brothers in church,
[1:42:09] he says, "Brother, you're blessed."
[1:42:11] Because her his daughter was speaking in
[1:42:13] tongues and so forth and all of that.
[1:42:15] When our children raise their hands in
[1:42:17] church when they're serving God, there
[1:42:19] ought to be tears coming out from her
[1:42:21] parents' eyes. My children or my
[1:42:23] grandchildren love the Lord.
[1:42:26] That's worth more than all the money and
[1:42:29] gold in the world.
[1:42:33] Amen. May God crown your ministry. Amen.
[1:42:39] As we come down towards the end, may God
[1:42:41] crown you. Whatever it is, housewife, I
[1:42:43] pray that God will crown your ministry.
[1:42:45] It may be a preacher. It may be a
[1:42:47] deacon. It may be a lay member. It may
[1:42:50] be a farmer. I don't know what it is.
[1:42:52] Whatever it is, may God crown your life
[1:42:55] with the glory of his word. At his
[1:42:58] second coming, rapture.
[1:43:01] you and take you away into another land.
[1:43:03] Well, you're you'll just be like that
[1:43:06] little fish that I talked about coming
[1:43:08] from the darkness of the ocean up to
[1:43:11] becoming a human or whatever. But Bam
[1:43:13] says, "I'm getting old. I know that each
[1:43:17] day I get a new ache and a pain." Amen.
[1:43:21] Brother Brandham, I think at this time
[1:43:23] was just a little over 50. Never got to
[1:43:25] be but 56. I'm already 63. Several years
[1:43:30] older than what he was. Amen. Some of us
[1:43:32] are older than that. Almost 70. Brother
[1:43:34] Martha. Something, isn't it? Makes you
[1:43:38] think.
[1:43:40] Amen.
[1:43:41] When we get down to that door,
[1:43:44] the thing that we're going to think the
[1:43:45] most about is what I I'll give you. I
[1:43:48] I'll read it. Thing that we're going to
[1:43:49] think about.
[1:43:51] New ache, new pain. Every one of us do.
[1:43:54] You might as well tell the truth. I
[1:43:57] said, I said, "God, don't let me." One
[1:44:00] of the most miserable things that I see
[1:44:01] a man or a woman that's never accepted
[1:44:04] Christ and just lives an old mossback
[1:44:08] church member, meaner than Satan
[1:44:10] himself.
[1:44:13] See him out there crabed
[1:44:16] at crabbed and old something. I tell
[1:44:20] you,
[1:44:22] that's the horriblest crown that Satan
[1:44:25] can crown a life with.
[1:44:27] A grouchy old woman about 60 or 70 years
[1:44:31] old with fat hanging down under her
[1:44:33] arms. How many knows you're not going to
[1:44:35] change that?
[1:44:37] That's right. Wrinkles all over her
[1:44:38] face. You're not going to change that.
[1:44:41] But her hair bobbed up four or five
[1:44:44] different colors and strutting herself
[1:44:46] down in a pair of little shorts. If that
[1:44:50] ain't a crowning of Satan, I never seen
[1:44:52] it. Or some crabby grouchy old man. How
[1:44:58] many know grouchiness? Crabiness.
[1:45:04] Unhappiness. That's not of God. We don't
[1:45:07] want to be crowned with that. Oh God,
[1:45:10] give me grace to never complain. Amen.
[1:45:14] How many know it's just much easier to
[1:45:16] complain?
[1:45:17] I want my life, Lord. I want my people's
[1:45:20] life, God. Granted that our life will be
[1:45:23] crowned no matter if we suffer. Amen.
[1:45:28] Whatever takes place,
[1:45:31] I didn't say it early, but a lot of
[1:45:32] times going down through life as we get
[1:45:34] older, a lot more of us have road rage
[1:45:37] in what we realize.
[1:45:39] Isn't that right? Road rage. I'm talking
[1:45:42] about the road that we've traveled has
[1:45:44] caused us to have a rage in our life.
[1:45:48] Bitter at people, bitter at things,
[1:45:51] recluse, don't like people because of
[1:45:53] the hurts that we've had, all the
[1:45:55] suffering that we've done. Hello.
[1:46:00] But Lord, help us not to have that kind
[1:46:01] of road rage.
[1:46:05] No matter how many turns against me, I
[1:46:07] know this one thing in my life as I get
[1:46:09] older, my friends. The stream stream
[1:46:12] behind me will soon be running out
[1:46:14] narrower and narrower as I go down the
[1:46:16] road. And I know one thing, it'll come
[1:46:19] to pass after a while that nobody will
[1:46:21] come to me and ask me advice.
[1:46:23] Amen. You become less noticed, less
[1:46:27] appreciated.
[1:46:30] The ones who know me in my younger days
[1:46:32] are all be gone if I shall live. My
[1:46:34] friends will get fewer and fewer as I
[1:46:36] get older now. And I know that someday
[1:46:38] I've got to die. I know. And I hope that
[1:46:40] God never lets Satan crown me as an old
[1:46:43] crabby indifferent man. And my wife, an
[1:46:48] old nagging woman or your wife
[1:46:52] or you that way. I pray, brother, that
[1:46:54] our lives will be crowned with the
[1:46:56] fruits of the spirit. How many know
[1:46:59] you'll meet two kinds of old people?
[1:47:01] You'll meet these sweet little
[1:47:05] just as nice.
[1:47:07] Amen.
[1:47:09] Or an old man that is kind and
[1:47:11] understanding and is patient
[1:47:14] or you'll meet a snappy one that'll
[1:47:16] smack you at this at the wrong word.
[1:47:21] Is that right? You'll either be nice and
[1:47:23] sweet and kind and or you'll be crabby
[1:47:25] as all get out. Life has a way of making
[1:47:28] you that. It has a way of molding you in
[1:47:30] that way.
[1:47:33] put a frown on your face quicker than
[1:47:35] anything. But God help us to keep a
[1:47:37] smile on our face. Don't let the devil
[1:47:39] rob you of your smile because he wants
[1:47:41] to.
[1:47:43] Amen.
[1:47:48] Your wife the way you are crowned with
[1:47:50] the fruits of the spirit, love, joy,
[1:47:53] longsuffering, gentleness, patience,
[1:47:56] truth, faith in the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:48:01] And I don't try I don't try say too much
[1:48:04] about it now, you know, around people
[1:48:07] complaining and so forth because I think
[1:48:09] one of the horriblest things that I see
[1:48:11] a man or a woman that's constantly
[1:48:12] complaining.
[1:48:15] I've always thought God keep me from it.
[1:48:18] That weakens faith all the time. How
[1:48:21] many knows there's a lot more to
[1:48:22] complain about when you get older? Sure
[1:48:24] there is. Amen.
[1:48:28] I know as I get older, I have aches and
[1:48:30] pains. I'm going to try to keep shut up
[1:48:33] about it. Hey, don't worry about it. God
[1:48:36] will take care of it.
[1:48:40] Amen. I'm gonna say it again. You know
[1:48:43] that stomach hurting that I had a couple
[1:48:45] weeks ago? I'm gonna say it again that
[1:48:49] I'm so thankful. We don't realize
[1:48:51] because I thought it was serious. It may
[1:48:53] still be. I don't know. I don't believe
[1:48:55] it was. I shouldn't say that, but I
[1:48:58] don't feel it anymore for people. I
[1:48:59] don't feel it anymore. I thank God for
[1:49:01] it. I'm feeling good. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:05] Amen.
[1:49:07] I think sometimes we have we get healed
[1:49:09] and don't even realize it. How many
[1:49:11] believe that? We do. Amen. But I realize
[1:49:14] it and I thank God for it.
[1:49:17] But it is easier. Listen to listen to
[1:49:19] this. woman that's constantly
[1:49:21] complaining.
[1:49:25] I've always thought, "God, keep me from
[1:49:26] it." Weaks in faith all the time. He
[1:49:29] says, "I know as I get older, each one
[1:49:31] of us, we're going to get something
[1:49:34] happen and and another something's going
[1:49:35] to happen. More things are going to
[1:49:37] happen. And I know those little things
[1:49:39] are going to keep accumulating." Amen.
[1:49:41] How many can say amen?
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; That's as you get older. They just got
[1:49:46] it. But I think one of the most horrible
[1:49:48] things is for Satan to crown a person's
[1:49:50] life is a crabed old man or a crab old
[1:49:53] woman. I hope I don't get to that place.
[1:49:55] I hope that I can bear it as my burdens
[1:50:00] get to a spot to where I want my life to
[1:50:02] be crowned with the glory of God, his
[1:50:04] longsuffering, his gentleness, his
[1:50:06] peace, his meekness, filled with the
[1:50:08] Holy Ghost. Another quote, "One of the
[1:50:12] my main things that's always hurt me
[1:50:14] through my life has been a nervous
[1:50:17] condition that when I get so worn and I
[1:50:20] get to feeling weary,
[1:50:23] I get the kind of feeling like nobody
[1:50:26] cares for you." Amen. How many know
[1:50:29] that's when we get older? Be careful.
[1:50:32] The devil put all kinds of thoughts like
[1:50:34] that in your heart. Nobody really cares
[1:50:36] about me. Nobody noticing me. I'm not
[1:50:40] important.
[1:50:41] Well, I'm not important anymore.
[1:50:45] I'm a has been.
[1:50:50] That's what the devil will tell you.
[1:50:51] You're not as you're not a hasb been.
[1:50:54] People do care about you. And brother
[1:50:56] Brandham had to fight that that nobody
[1:50:58] loves him. Nobody cares for him. And
[1:50:59] then he be to think again, but what
[1:51:01] about all those people come knocking on
[1:51:02] your door? He can't stay at a hotel. He
[1:51:05] says, "There you go, devil. Yeah, people
[1:51:06] do care about me. Yeah, people do love
[1:51:09] me. How many will say that? Say, God,
[1:51:11] when the devil tries to tell me I ain't
[1:51:12] got no friends and nobody cares about
[1:51:14] me. Forget that. You got friends.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; You got church people that love you. God
[1:51:19] loves you. If nobody else does, that's
[1:51:21] good enough. If Jesus loves you, be
[1:51:23] happy.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; You sisters, you want to be like that
[1:51:28] old lady, I guess it was, and she always
[1:51:30] would say everything good about people.
[1:51:32] So, somebody thought they'd get her. And
[1:51:34] they said, "Hey, ma'am, what about the
[1:51:36] devil?
[1:51:38] What can you say good about the devil?
[1:51:42] And she said, "He's a good adversary."
[1:51:49] Talk about being positive. How many
[1:51:52] believe you want to stay positive?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Keep a smile on your face. Keep smiling.
[1:51:56] The devil don't like it. Amen. That's
[1:51:59] right. He's a good adversary.
[1:52:04] That's right.
[1:52:06] Nobody cares for you. He says, "And you
[1:52:09] have it, too." He says, "You have it,
[1:52:11] too." And I just happened to have a real
[1:52:14] overdose of it. So, apparently, Brother
[1:52:16] Bannon would had just a real bad case of
[1:52:18] it.
[1:52:20] And he had a right to, you know, in
[1:52:23] 1963, he barely had a place to preach
[1:52:26] there for a while. and the ministry that
[1:52:29] he had 50,000 heathens and every meeting
[1:52:33] 500,000 people come to his meetings to
[1:52:35] see the manifestation of Jesus Christ,
[1:52:38] God using him and then come down to
[1:52:39] where he barely had an open door. That
[1:52:42] had to be depressing.
[1:52:44] That had to be it had to weigh on him.
[1:52:47] Nobody really cares.
[1:52:50] Amen. At one place, Brother Brandham, he
[1:52:52] had he had emotions. He had feelings.
[1:52:55] How many believe we got to watch? We got
[1:52:56] to check that as old people. Watch your
[1:52:59] emotions and your feelings. Don't let
[1:53:00] the devil use him and all of a sudden
[1:53:02] get you to whining and complaining.
[1:53:05] But he was just going to go out in the
[1:53:07] mountains. Remember,
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; nobody would listen to him. He had the
[1:53:10] gift of God and he should have had
[1:53:11] everybody coming to Christ and nobody
[1:53:13] would. He says, "Let me just go out like
[1:53:15] John the Baptist, go out in the
[1:53:16] wilderness and I'll come back." And we
[1:53:18] all know why where that would have led
[1:53:19] him in that dump along with all the
[1:53:22] others. uh you know because his wife
[1:53:24] would have left him he said and
[1:53:25] everything else if he had tried to live
[1:53:26] like that so God had to straighten him
[1:53:29] up on that but he he got the blues he
[1:53:32] said I had just had an overdose of it
[1:53:34] you know it gets real bad sometimes
[1:53:37] Amen hardly it's tension that's what
[1:53:41] does it and I get to a spot that many
[1:53:42] times especially so many of those vision
[1:53:44] things that happen so then when you
[1:53:47] wonder then you get to thinking well he
[1:53:50] says and you get off to your and think,
[1:53:52] well, now what have I done? Amen. As you
[1:53:55] get older, you think almost 70, maybe
[1:53:59] 60, whatever it might be. What have I
[1:54:00] done? Where have I gotten to in life?
[1:54:04] Amen, brother John. We think about that.
[1:54:08] How much have I achieved?
[1:54:10] You'll have thoughts, what have I
[1:54:12] achieved?
[1:54:14] Devil try to get to you to look at all
[1:54:15] your mistakes that you've made. Makes
[1:54:17] you feel bad about that.
[1:54:19] Amen. How many's glad for the blood of
[1:54:21] Jesus Christ?
[1:54:23] Amen.
[1:54:25] You're thinking, "What have I done? I'm
[1:54:27] 50 years old and I've done nothing for
[1:54:29] the Lord. I'm getting old." He says,
[1:54:33] "And what's and then you just get what
[1:54:36] we used to call the blues." Some of you
[1:54:38] brethren about my age remember what they
[1:54:40] used to call the blues. Amen.
[1:54:45] Let me just ask you this morning, how
[1:54:47] many in tears ever got the blues?
[1:54:54] Yeah, I've got them.
[1:54:56] I've got the blues. When you just kind
[1:54:59] of get down, kind of want to give up,
[1:55:02] just just don't know how to hardly go
[1:55:05] on. Just the blues. Amen.
[1:55:10] My wife knows. Don't talk to me. Just
[1:55:14] leave me alone.
[1:55:16] That's the way I get. Leave me alone.
[1:55:18] Give me a day, whatever it takes.
[1:55:22] And I got to pray. Say, Lord, get me up
[1:55:24] out of these blues
[1:55:27] because I'm not always smiling, folks. I
[1:55:29] do get the blues.
[1:55:32] I'm sure you do, too. Amen. But God
[1:55:35] don't want you that way. Amen. Pop used
[1:55:38] to call it, and I wonder what it meant.
[1:55:40] And I sure know what he meant. So then
[1:55:43] he says you go to feeling that way which
[1:55:46] none of which none of it he says is
[1:55:48] true. It's just you. Amen. It's just
[1:55:51] you. He says you know it. He says you
[1:55:54] know it's just you doing that. Amen. You
[1:55:57] allowing yourself to get into that place
[1:56:00] and then you get over it.
[1:56:03] So how many would say Lord help me this
[1:56:05] morning. Help me this morning to have a
[1:56:08] cheerful attitude. Let me be a lively
[1:56:11] stone. Let me be an example to my
[1:56:14] grandchildren.
[1:56:16] Let me set the pace of what stability
[1:56:19] looks like. Ain't that right? What a
[1:56:21] stable, sound Christian, unmovable,
[1:56:24] solid in the gospel. Amen. Is like.
[1:56:29] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[1:56:31] this morning. That was my message. I
[1:56:33] hope you enjoyed it. Let's stand if you
[1:56:35] will with me.
[1:56:37] Let's give the Lord a hand. Say, "Thank
[1:56:38] you, Lord Jesus.
[1:56:40] Thank you, Lord. The Lord gives glory.
[1:56:43] Amen. Now, let's bow our heads and
[1:56:45] change the order of the service. Lord
[1:56:47] Jesus, we come before you this morning
[1:56:49] thankful over Lord, many of us that are
[1:56:52] up 50, 60 years old, 40, no matter,
[1:56:56] we're all thankful, Lord Jesus, for your
[1:56:59] hand that has held us, Lord Jesus. We
[1:57:02] haven't always held your hand, but
[1:57:04] you've held ours, Father. And you've
[1:57:06] brought us through many different
[1:57:07] things, Lord. Many molding times,
[1:57:09] shaping times, forming times, things
[1:57:12] that we went through that formed our
[1:57:14] character, that shaped us, Lord Jesus.
[1:57:18] And if in any way, Father, our character
[1:57:20] isn't the way that it's supposed to be,
[1:57:22] we know you'll have to. You will break
[1:57:25] us back down. You'll take that, Lord,
[1:57:27] and you'll shape it into your image
[1:57:28] because we're predestinated to be
[1:57:31] conformed to the image of your son. That
[1:57:33] is your heart's desire, Lord. We pray,
[1:57:36] Father, that you'll continue to mold us.
[1:57:38] Help each one of us, Lord, that are
[1:57:40] older or younger, Father, if we've
[1:57:41] gotten a heart of stone, if we've gotten
[1:57:44] hard-hearted, Lord Jesus, tenderize us
[1:57:46] and make us realize as, Father, if we
[1:57:48] want a friend, maybe we should be more
[1:57:50] friendly. If we want kindness, maybe we
[1:57:52] should be showing others kindness, Lord.
[1:57:54] And quit worrying so much about oursel
[1:57:56] and think more about others and stay
[1:57:59] that way, Lord Jesus, because it's not
[1:58:00] about us, but Lord, about manifesting
[1:58:03] you, Lord Jesus. And we ask God that
[1:58:04] you'd help each one here this morning,
[1:58:06] Father, that we would be crowned, our
[1:58:08] lives would be crowned with the fruits
[1:58:10] of the spirit that we have joy and peace
[1:58:13] and gentleness and longsuffering and
[1:58:16] patience and meekness, Lord, in our
[1:58:17] lives, Lord. Not to be impatient and
[1:58:20] snappy and crabby, Lord Jesus. Not that
[1:58:23] way, Lord Jesus, and complaining about
[1:58:25] everything. God, help us not to be that
[1:58:26] way, but to be thankful for what we have
[1:58:29] for there's always somebody in bad worse
[1:58:32] shape than what we are. So, we should
[1:58:34] always be thankful, Lord. And we ask,
[1:58:36] God, that you'd help us to be in that
[1:58:38] way. And now, Father, as we're about to
[1:58:40] take the Lord's supper, Father, as we're
[1:58:41] about to take the wine and the bread,
[1:58:43] the foot washing to remember that it was
[1:58:45] all because of Calvary that we can re
[1:58:48] have strength, Lord Jesus, to have our
[1:58:50] lives crowned with your glory. Lord, we
[1:58:52] ask God that we'd help each one that
[1:58:54] that take partakes of it, Lord Jesus, in
[1:58:56] Jesus name. Amen. Turn your Bibles if
[1:58:59] you will to First Corinthians
[1:59:02] the 11th chapter.
[1:59:08] 1 Corinthians 11
[1:59:15] verse 23. For I have received of the
[1:59:17] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:59:19] you. That the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:59:21] in which he was betrayed took bread. And
[1:59:23] when he had given thanks, he broke it
[1:59:25] and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[1:59:26] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:59:29] remembrance of me." After the same
[1:59:31] manner, he also took the cup. When he
[1:59:33] had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new
[1:59:34] testament in my blood. This do ye as
[1:59:36] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:59:38] me. For as often as you eat of this
[1:59:40] bread and drink of this cup, you do show
[1:59:42] the Lord's death until he come.
[1:59:44] Wherefore, wherefore, whosoever shall
[1:59:46] eat of this bread and drink of this cup
[1:59:48] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:59:51] of the body and blood of the Lord. Amen.
[1:59:53] Let me just say this. I believe you
[1:59:55] should be filled with the Holy Ghost to
[1:59:57] take this. Amen.
[1:59:59] Because if you're not filled with the
[2:00:01] Holy Ghost, you really take it
[2:00:02] unworthily. Amen. But let a man examine
[2:00:04] himself, and so let him eat of that
[2:00:06] bread and drink of that cup. For he that
[2:00:08] eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth
[2:00:10] and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not
[2:00:12] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[2:00:14] cause many are weak and sickly among
[2:00:16] you, and many sleep. For if we would
[2:00:18] judge ourselves, we should not be
[2:00:19] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[2:00:21] chastening of the Lord, that we should
[2:00:22] not be condemned with the world.
[2:00:25] Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[2:00:26] together to eat, tar one for another,
[2:00:28] and if any man hunger, let him eat at
[2:00:30] home, that he come not together unto
[2:00:32] condemnation. And the rest will I set in
[2:00:35] order when I come. Amen. Everybody that
[2:00:37] wants to take of the Lord's supper this
[2:00:40] afternoon, if you would come up around
[2:00:41] to the right
