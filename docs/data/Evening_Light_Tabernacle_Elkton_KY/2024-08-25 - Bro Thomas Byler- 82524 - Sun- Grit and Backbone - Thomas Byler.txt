[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] morning brothers and sisters it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning if we'll just all stand this morning maybe brother John Wade w open us in prayer this morning e e amen the children can be dismissed for Sunday school and if you go in the Psalms with me to Psalm 16 you know nothing with God Is by mistake we're all we're all here for a reason and a purpose and uh we can look back over our lives and think of where God's brought us from and know that he's going to do something for us today as well Psalms 16 preserve me oh God for in thee do I put my trust but to the saints that are in the Earth and to the excellent in whom is all might Delight the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup thou has maintain us my lot I Will Bless The Lord who ha given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night seasons therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope thou Wilt this one together thou Wilt show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters like what brother Joy was saying if you look down the course of your life how many times do you see where God's hand is moving you and guiding you in the years that follow and the years P you know you know I'm a old I was raised on the Long Island Sound in the North Shore of Long Island and where am I am this morning at 65 I'm in Elon Kentucky this morning God moves us all along Our Lives to get us to a place where he wants us this morning if you would uh turn with you know I I guess that happens to you when you get older you want you wind up thinking about your I guess your childhood a little bit more than what you used to when you're in your middle age and sometimes I find myself thinking about you know just being a young man like some of these living on the North Shore of Long Island and all the things I used to do as a kid on the NorthShore and you know that's but God brought me somewhere else uh if you would turn with me to Philippians the 3D chapter little hint here I used to be able as a kid to get on my bike and I could fish for bass and crappie in a pond or in a in a lake and then get on my same bike and drive to the to the NorthShore and be able to fish in salt water I mean you know it's things you remember as a kid but I was reading this chapter I was talking about it um last uh Sunday I was thinking and I was talking to a person earlier this week about this and I I'll I'll read the word of God itself because it speaks for itself but uh this is what Paul had to say finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievous but for you it is safe and Paul warns us here and this is thousands of year beware of dogs and beware of evil workers and uh Beware of concision and it goes on to say for we are the circumcision with worship God in the spirit rejoicing Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh and that's where we're at this morning there's no there's you can't put your trust in the flesh in the in that you have to put your trust in the Lord this morning and he goes on to sayther I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath where he might Trust In the Flesh I'm more and he he goes into saying who he is who he was actually before God got a hold of him circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews has touched in the law a Pharisee so he's identifying who he was before Jesus Christ saved him and brought him into position that he was here concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness whichin the law blameless so he's identifying according to the law he lived blameless but it didn't mean anything even for him and he goes on to say but what things were gained to me I count it loss for Christ so he's willing to throw all that aside once God got a hold of him and revealed to him the word for his hour he was ready to throw it all aside this morning and he he goes on he doubtless I count all things but a loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord from whom I have suffered the loss of all things and to count them but D that I might win Christ so he didn't look at his losses is something important he didn't look back he wasn't looking back to what he was he was looking forward to who he is today and that's the way we need to be as Christians not not looking back there's good things you that happened to you in your life that aren't aren't a problem looking back to but the person that we were the unrepented sinner that we were back in those days no time in our life should we be looking back to that person and Paul goes on to say and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is by God by faith so everything we are is by faith in Jesus Christ that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering be made conformable onto his death that's all our desire this morning that scripture speaks for itself but these last couple of verses is what I was talking about last weekend uh Sunday and kind of goes to it says if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had or already attained either was already perfect so he wasn't perfect before this but I follow after that which I may apprehend apprehend for that which I am apprehended of Jesus Christ so God got a hold of him not himself but God got a hold of Paul that day on the on the road to Damascus Brethren I count myself not to have happended but this one thing do I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth onto those things which are before so his his whole mind his whole body everything was on the cross and he was looking forward to everything that he was doing in his life and he goes I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus and I said Here let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything you be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this onto you and then this is what I was thinking about and saying last weekend never less where to we have already attained let us walk by the same rules let us mind the same things and then this is Paul's telling this is kind of like what I was saying last weekend Paul saying says this Brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk as you have have of us for an example so he's telling them if you have a Godly example follow that Godly example and he goes on to say say and we had that example in our age and these Believers had the example in their age in Paul and he goes on for many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are enemies of the Cross of Christ so Paul is saying that there are some out there already and he's before he even goes off the scene there are people perverting the Gospel of Jesus Christ already and I lost my place but whose end is destruction who got God is their belly and whose glory is their shame who mind Earthly things for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashion like unto the Glorious body is according to the work and whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself and I was thinking of another chapter in the Bible that kind of seconds this if you'll go with me to I was about to say I'm not if you go with me to Peter the thir chapter so we have an example you shouldn't be afraid to talk to people about the example who you have today the message that we follow there's nothing wrong in the message there's nothing to be afraid of there's nothing to be embarrassed about as long as you're leading people to Jesus Christ it'll all work out in the end and but um I don't want to read successive chapters but I always found in my life if I just read the word of God it's more than enough to keep you on the right path um he's Peter talks in this chapter about the new heavens and the new Earth and then starting at the about the 12th verse it says looking for the hastening onto the coming day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall put melt with fervent heat but then he he changes in the end in starting at this 13th verse nevertheless we according to his promise look for the new heavens and a new Earth wherein we dwell wherein dwelleth righteousness and we all know from the message of the hour that we follow from the word of God the only thing that's going to be on there that day is righteousness those that have given it all away and only Embrace Jesus Christ we're going to be there on that day and he goes on to say wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be D be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blamus and account that longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given onto him have written onto you so Peter's identifying right here who Paul is saying what Paul Paul has written excuse me so he's identifying pet Peter Paul Peter is identifying Paul in the gospel here this morning and he goes on to say and also in his Epistles speaking in in them of these things in which are are some things hard to understand which they that are unlearned and unstable rest and that's really important for us the more this morning is to be stable in the word of God and and there's a lot of things that you can worry about but the word of God will settle it all and he goes on to say I lost my place again I say that a lot same thing hard to understand which they that are learned an unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destructure and we don't have that problem in this day and age as long as you use the word of God and the message of the hour and don't put anything behind it or before it you'll be fine and he goes on to say here you therefore beloved seeing you know these things before be aware at least you being led away with the error of the wick Wicked fall from your own steadfastness but grow in Grace and in knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be the glory forever and ever amen so I was listened to several messages yesterday and this morning and I was just thinking as we the world I'm I'm not even going to say the world is just a crazy place this morning so you can't worry about the world all you got to do is worry about yourself and your family that's the only thing that you really need to worry about and you shouldn't be worrying if you're in Jesus Christ this morning I know I teach a lot about it but if you have true Eternal hope this morning through the word of God you know it's settled already God has settled that for you already so there's nothing for you to worry about in the days that come ahead as long as you hold on to Jesus Christ this morning everything else will work its way out this morning brother David amen you love the Lord this morning amen let's stand if we could this morning sing that little chor All My Hope Is In Jesus this morning amen and All My Hope Is In Jesus God my yesterday's goal all my sins are [Music] forgiven and I been wased by can we sing it one more

go from here transformed Lord Jesus into a better person and not worse Lord and we just ask your blessing upon the baptism father and every portion of the service we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen amen I have a odd subject this morning I wish going to just title it grit amen grit I told Brother Brad it's kind of a cont I don't know I don't even know for sure what contemporary means but maybe a kind of contemporary title because usually you'll take a scripture or whatever but am me we want to talk about um amen grit with the help of the Lord this morning brother bam mentions grit eight times and so we have amen that we want to use Amen in speaking on this and so once again as always when I just take one simple scripture when the holy spirit opens it up amen if you would go down every Avenue that the Holy Spirit want wants you to go well we would be here a while but amen we'll just try to follow the spirit would that be okay amen amen Craig and Penny and Donna God bless you Martha I mean still good to see everybody here amen so praise the Lord still hanging out in Kentucky that's good praise the Lord so God bless you good to see you all this morning amen turn your bibles if you will to Hebrew Hebrews the 12th chapter Hebrews 12 thank you brother Glenn for that song that was very good wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which thus easily so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that set it before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was sit down before him endureed the cross despising the shame and is sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself least you be wearied and faint in your minds for he have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen now in this I want to uh basically speak on I begin to think about this and let me just read the quote here before I pull pull some of this other up because one want to use a lot of different words to try to tie it into this brother brenon makes a statement he says you know anything that I hate to see is a spineless person call themselves a Christian my God wants somebody with grit and backbone so I titled it grit and backbone amen amen I like old buddy Robinson said Lord give me backbone the size of a saw log and plenty of knowledge in the Gable end of my soul and let me fight the devil as long as I got one tooth and then gum him till I die amen that's right I like that amen he got down in the corn field and said Lord if you don't give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you come back to earth you're going to find a pile of bones laying right here God give him and God give him the Holy Ghost see you got to get determined that's right get ready take over God said so let's go take over amen all right I'm going to I'm going to stop right there and pick up again here but uh the words that we want to some of the words that we want to look at as we talk about what causes you to have grit amen one of those words would be of course the one of the first things I begin to think about it would be perseverance ain't that right perseverance it takes perseverance is grit in another form ain't that right persistence amen persistence amen that's another word patience would be another one how many knows that you got to those uh those who through patience isin that right obtained the promises patience is also a form of grit because it's sometimes hard to be patient isn't it no it's hard but you just got to be patient you got to make yourself be patient amen amen another one is courage courage gives you grit amen I looked up what grit meant and it put it this way he said um it says courage and resolve strength of character how many know we're living in an age that has no grit we're living in an hour when people have no backb I think it was brother bam says give me a John Henry a Patrick Henry and and a Abraham Lincoln give me a George Washington give me somebody that has some backbone politicians is like he said you know what we'll just give the people whatever they want give me somebody that'll stand for something somebody that'll have principes somebody that has character those folks aren't asham to tell you what they think about their absolute terrible ideas and terrible thoughts and yet sometime we're afraid to say anything wrong but they been by grit and backbone tells you no I think that you are wrong hello that's right to to tell the truth takes grit amen strength we think of it a lot of times am mean as strength grit strong or to endure to be tough Amen to be tough to be strong to have courage to have resolve resolve I like that word brother bam he likes that word uh perseverance and and so forth amen so there's some of the words just more more courage courage Faith brings grit and uh if we get time to I don't know we will but we want to we want to the one of the greatest things that gives you grit is love is that right it gives you strength it gives you resolve love is the greatest Giver of grip courage and resolved I like that I am resolved no longer to linger Charmed by the world to like things that are higher things that are nobler these have allured my sight amen so we want to take a little journey down to scriptures would that be all right amen I've got wrote down here how many knows that Noah had to have grit 100 and 20 years of [Applause] endurance 12 years of waiting for a promise for the promise to be fulfilled 120 years but he endured he waited he had grit God oh I might as well preach Jesus Christ God almighty he wants you to have grit he wants you to have backbone even Jesus said if you're going to follow me right you better have some backbone you better be willing to forsake all to follow me father mother brother sister home no matter what it is you better have something good about you and your own life and your own self also and you better be willing to take up the cross and fell on me and die to yourself that's some real he I can have a little back people oh well I'll lose my pen and I'll lose my position as a pastor as a deacon as this that or the other in my church if I believe that get some good about you stand for what's right amen all right sometimes sometimes real grit is having the ability Amen to say I'm sorry I'm wrong a that right that's right remember one

grit to confess to say I'm wrong I'm sorry to say forgive me takes a lot of grit to say you know what you're right I was wrong how many knows it takes the Holy Ghost to do that how many thankful for the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost gives you the Holy Ghost all of these things give you grit they give you strength of character it gives you resolve just like buddy Robinson was is that right he said man

his power to us word who believe according to the work of his mighty power which he brought in Christ when he raised him from the dead set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places fire above all principality power might dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but in the world to come and has put everything under his feet and gave him to be the head of the church which is his body the fullness that filth all in all he is the head we are the body and every devil is under our feet everything is subject to a Believer everything's subject to a Believer wow let me see oh how many believes we've got exceeding precious promises but if you're going to inherit him if you're going to get him it's going to take a little determination it takes a little determination amen God

the props from under you butam says the reason is you let him do it oh it ain't the devil's fault somehow or other you lost your grit you lost your perseverance you backslid you quit praying like you should something happened don't blame God don't blame the devil he said you let him you let him do it it's what he said oh my see he's just a bluff he has no legal right if you got an experience with god of the resurrection of Jesus Christ he stripped Satan of every privilege that he had wo aren't you glad he ain't got no right he has no right to rob you of your joy he ain't got no right to rob you of your love and your patience and your long suffering and gentleness meekness your peace how many knows you only got peace because you're right with God therefore being justified we have peace with God you got to be justified You' got to be clean to be right with God and to have peace with God so he'll try to get you to trip up mess up or something to rob you of your peace but if you've got it listen he robbed him of everything he had took it away from him he robbed him and stripped him of the that and he gave the power to the church listen he gave gave the power to the church he stripped the devil of everything and then he gave his power to the church now you can do the same things that I did he says the things that I do shall you do also how many believes he says you in my

Believer is not a coward you have to take God at his word Hebrews 128 I believe it is for without faith it is impossible to please God for they that come to him must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that haphazardly seek him no diligently seek him sometimes God don't answer your prayer he didn't answer uh Noah's prayer for 120 years but he was diligent he didn't answer Abraham's prayer for 25 years but he answered he God loves to see diligence sometimes we pray and we don't think it happen God's testing you God is seeing how much grit that you really have well I got prayed for but it didn't happen huh that's the devil's line well it didn't happen so guess what my line is I'll wait till it does I'll keep believing till it does happen I don't care if it's today if

Philistines tell you that the days of Miracles is passed when Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever let that just soak in like a sponge that he is the same yesterday today and forever what you have need of he is here to supply if you'll just get quit and believe his word remember faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you don't see it but you believe it real genuine Faith all right I hate to say I'm going to hurry because I'm getting off track when I say I gotta hurry is it okay for me to say when you hear a preacher say that know this he's getting off track why because prophet of God said Jesus never gets in a hurry so if I want to hurry I'm just going to slow myself back down because I ain't going to get across if I hurry through this too much we can take another another service if we aren't raptured by then ain't that right anyway that's free all right listen now I'll notice after he said after today yesterday and forever you mean to tell me you they tell you that the baptism of the Holy Ghost ain't just as real today as it was on when it fa on the fell fell on the day Pentecost how many believes that if you'll believe on the Lord Jesus Christ amen while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them amen and if you aren't having Bap gotten the baptism of the Holy Ghost already after you get baptized when you come forth lay hands then you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the same as it ever was never has changed praise the Lord he said you shall receive power after you after you have uh after

see that little bitty fella anymore hello the devil let him be that little bitty fellow amen all right couple Bible stories yet I would like to get to love for a minute if I could but let's go uh a couple Bible scriptures amen of people who were persistent who were perseverant amen so we see in Hebrews 11:6 it says that you've got to he reward he's a rewarder of those those that diligently seek Him isn't that right Amen in Luke 18 Luke 18 1-8 and he spake a parable unto them to this end he says that men ought always to pray and not faint how many believes in prayer oh yeah I believe it saying there was a in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversaries and he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself do I fear not God nor regard man yet because this W woman Widow troubleth me I will avenge her at least by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge said and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth what was it this was an example of perseverance with that woman she would not leave him alone and he said teach him to pray amen and keep praying amen if you don't get it keep praying believing keep knocking until God says you know what I really believe he believes yes God says you know that unjust judge he gave it to her isn't God much more going to give you what you asked for amen but have a little per perseverance about you Matthew 15 Matthew 1521 then Jesus went then and departed into the coast of Ty and siden and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us ain't that something here a woman ask something of him ask mercy and he didn't even talk to her brother Braham says man many Pentecostals would have really got an attitude he know doesn't he know I have a PhD who does he think he is and I'm just going to say this because it comes to my mind I believe that was the attitude a lot of those Pentecostal Pentecostals had to's brother brandom well who's he who's he to tell us that if we have a PhD it just means that we're that far much further away from God who is he huh when he corrects him and so forth when he does all that they thought they were you know because their attitude TS the prophet was towards Christ amen because God was with him chres after but he answered and listened but he answered and said I am not sent unto the lost but the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him and saying Lord help me and he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs call me a dog cuz Gentiles were considered dogs isn't that right and she said that's the truth that's right this is where brother bam always said you know he says any anybody that's got the right spirit always acknowledged that what Jesus said is the truth she acknowledged that's the truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from the master's table amen and Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very houren [Applause] amen praise the Lord I don't see my scripture down on the other one so I'll just re refer to her the woman with the blood issue ain't that right and there was a lot of people around her and there was a big press what they call and she had a blood issue couldn't get healed no doctors could help her spent all money to try to get better woo how many know when you get to your Wit's End that's a good time to come to the Lord see Here I Am Lord and this woman did Jesus didn't touch her hello he didn't do like with this woman this woman come up there and she said in her heart if I can just touch the ham of His Garment and she pushed her way through kind of like that Mexican woman had a dead baby Amen brother bam says the deacons man they couldn't keep her out she would climb over him she'd try to get under him but she was going to get to the prophet cuz she knew that God was with him I like saying that don't you God was with our Prophet everywhere he went and she made her way through finally brother bam says to us you one of y'all go down there and pray for her she doesn't know who I am just go pray for her whatever you know and and and they were about to go pray for whatever and all of a sudden he got the vision Vision broke that that baby was alive and never right they said Hold on hold on Brothers bring her here prayed for her and that baby come out of come from the dead rose up again they went back back to the doctor the next day and got a statement from the doctor doctor had wrote up a death certificate he had absolutely declared it dead brought that baby back and said he was alive but she was determined just like this woman I'm going to Touch the Hem of His Garment how many glad that if you it doesn't matter if you really need to touch him am me just to touch you touch his heart the ham of His Garment and you'll be healed of whatever you have need of it's just important to get into his presence if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment amen praise the Lord I believe that's what we're doing this morning from glory to glory he's changing me his likeness and image to perfecting me much on faith and what it does but let's conclude this morning with talking about the aspect of love and theg grit that comes with having the love of God in your heart Nothing Compares nothing because we know that Jesus was the master of grit brother BR well not brother BR but the Bible says you know that when Jesus spoke he spoke as one with authority how many knows he had Authority he knew where he stood he would look at those phes and scribes right in the face and tell them the truth huh would you tell a lgp person the truth would you tell your somebody that you know the truth if they you know they were way off in left field huh or would you just kind of keep quiet sometimes butam even talked about it he says sometimes we even as preachers you got to be careful well I better hold back to don't you Hold Back didn't he say if a preacher will hold back on anybody because the tithe they pay or this that or the other he says he ain't fit to be up there got to preach what the Holy Ghost tells you to preach amen Jesus was the master we all know the Garden of Gethsemane was his biggest battle biggest battle to have to go to Calvary to be mocked to be spit on to be crucified so when he was being mocked when he went up there to captured him spit on him beat on him plucked his beard false accused him and he opened n his mouth he had more grit than anybody ever will have not only that but falsely accused buddy I'm telling you what if somebody falsely accuses you to your face and think think about Jesus knowing he had the power to change the whole thing what if you was falsely accused what if you was done that way and yet you had the power to completely change it most likely we might you'd have to have a lot of grit not to you'd have to have a lot of self-control Amen to follow the leading of the spirit on it somebody claps you upside the head does you wrong to be able to go pray for him takes grit that's much harder to do a lot of times than it is Amen to get revenge revenge is easy but to commit it to God that's hard false accused and then go out there and be crucified and to die is that right that took a lot for God to do but he had so much love for you you and you You Caroline you Zoe Elena all of you he has so much love for you he said there ain't no way I'm calling for seven Legions of angels and changing this no way even when they said if you're Christ you say you God come down off the cross and we'll believe you he had grit you know what he said Woody you have never told me what to do and you're not going to start now telling me what to do that right didn't even the devil when he tempted he said says if you be God turned his uh swn into bread if you're going to one jump off the temple the angels will bear thee up get thee behind me you're not my master I don't clown for you amen why he had grit he wasn't going to give in to their wishes that would have been exactly what the devil would have wanted for him to come down off the cross and not die for us but Jesus knew I'll tell you what I'll do I like this I'll tell you what I'll do I'm gonna go ahead and be crucified I'm going to die on the cross and I'm going to release my and it ain't going to be just me anymore it's going to be thousands and millions of men defeating you lry stand to your feet this morning give him praise thank you Jesus for dying for me thank you for Calvary thank you Lord Jesus to Heaven grit and not coming off the cross for loving me thank you Lord for loving me like that woman baby safire was her house was on fire there was a baby upstairs the fire department would not go in in their clothes and in their protection she grabbed the blanket and ran up the stairs grabbed that baby wrapped it in that blanket and got burnt all the way down and said I got my baby love will give you grit unlike you've ever seen it'll make make you live for God it'll make you love your neighbor it'll make you love everybody how many need e more grit amen needs more backbone to stand in this hour cuz if you're going into Rapture you're you're going to have a backbone like a saog you are going to be one tough cookie in English Kentucky terms you're going to be one tough cookie he tries everything to crack you he tries
