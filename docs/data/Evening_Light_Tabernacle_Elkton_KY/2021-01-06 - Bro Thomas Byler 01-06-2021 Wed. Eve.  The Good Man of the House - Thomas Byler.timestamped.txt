[29:21] you'd be with them lord jesus and father
[29:23] may
[29:24] the things that we hear may be more than
[29:26] just words but maybe
[29:28] father you that comes down into our

[29:39] in jesus name amen and amen
[29:43] praise the lord turn your bibles if you
[29:44] will
[29:46] amen i uh my wife turned on a on on a
[29:51] message
[29:52] and i was beginning to listen to what it
[29:55] was saying and
[29:56] it certainly went along with what we had
[29:58] talked about sunday that
[30:00] it just seemed to have struck a little
[30:02] something and so
[30:03] i said well i think i'll just go that
[30:05] direction amen
[30:07] because it certainly went along with
[30:08] what we spoke on sunday but only it
[30:10] might go
[30:11] perhaps a little deeper amen and what we
[30:14] did sunday was
[30:15] uh maybe not i wouldn't say deeper
[30:17] because i think all of god's word is
[30:19] deep but
[30:20] just in a little different direction
[30:22] amen that's something that we've all
[30:23] heard
[30:24] many times before amen and so
[30:28] but i trust it'll be a blessing to you
[30:30] tonight amen
[30:31] let's turn to the book of matthew i mean
[30:34] luke
[30:35] luke the 12th chapter
[30:57] and we'll begin with
[31:00] verse 35 let your loyance be girded
[31:03] about
[31:05] in your lights burning and ye yourselves
[31:08] like unto men
[31:10] that wait for the lord when he will
[31:13] return from the wedding
[31:14] then that when he who cometh and
[31:17] knocketh
[31:19] they may open unto him immediately
[31:22] blessed are those servants whom the lord
[31:24] when he cometh shall find watching
[31:27] verily i say unto you that he shall gird
[31:29] himself and make them to sit down to
[31:31] meet
[31:32] and will come forth and serve them
[31:36] and if he shall come in the second watch
[31:38] or
[31:39] come in the third watch and find them so
[31:42] blessed are those
[31:43] servants and this know that if the good
[31:47] man of the house had known in
[31:49] what hour the thief would come he would
[31:52] have watched and not have suffered his
[31:54] house
[31:55] to be broken through amen
[31:58] praise the lord may god and his
[32:00] blessings to the reading of the word you
[32:01] can be seated
[32:03] tonight i want to title this the goodman
[32:07] of the house the good man of the house
[32:12] brother brahm talked about where jesus
[32:14] was talking about when an unclean spirit
[32:16] goes out of a man
[32:17] he said when he's going out of a man
[32:19] that spirit
[32:20] walks in dry places and returns again
[32:24] with seven other devils is that right
[32:28] he says if the good man of the house
[32:30] isn't there to protect
[32:33] that house and the good man of your
[32:35] house
[32:36] is your faith
[32:40] if it isn't there to war him off he will
[32:43] come in and force himself
[32:44] in that life and the same power of faith
[32:46] that taken the devil
[32:48] the life out your unbelief will restore
[32:50] it again
[32:51] amen so brother man in many different
[32:54] places called the good man
[32:56] of the house faith amen
[32:59] and so i was listening as my wife had
[33:02] played that tape and i was she was
[33:04] listening
[33:04] to the message called the greatest
[33:06] battle that was ever fought amen
[33:09] and i thought sunday you know with what
[33:11] we had said about
[33:13] how that every government every church
[33:16] every individual is controlled or
[33:19] governed
[33:20] by only two factions amen you know
[33:24] i you know and just two two different
[33:25] things that you can be governed by
[33:27] one of them is fear amen which is
[33:30] a a something derives from or comes from
[33:34] unbelief or doubt in that right and so
[33:37] the other one is faith
[33:39] amen which is governed by what love
[33:42] is that right we know that even faith
[33:44] has a governor that's love
[33:45] but you're controlled by those two
[33:47] things
[33:49] each and every one of us amen and so
[33:51] brother bannon when he went and
[33:52] preached on the greatest battle that was
[33:54] ever fought of course we
[33:56] are very familiar with it one thing i
[33:58] did catch
[33:59] towards the end of the service was how
[34:01] did the lord had
[34:02] told him i didn't do a very detailed
[34:05] study of it but
[34:07] we know that brother madam had seen the
[34:08] vision and so forth that he was going to
[34:10] cross a river
[34:11] he was going to cross a lake or some
[34:13] great place that a canoe wouldn't cross
[34:15] isn't that right he was going to cross
[34:16] over and some others were wanting to
[34:18] follow him and
[34:19] we did you know the spirit says don't do
[34:21] it because if they they will try to
[34:23] follow you in that canoe and but
[34:24] abandonment is saying that you can't
[34:26] come there i'm the only one that can go
[34:27] there
[34:28] what all the meaning that is i don't
[34:30] know but he did say this i do remember
[34:32] this and that is that he said he says
[34:34] why don't you go back
[34:35] and store up food if you'll go back and
[34:37] store food
[34:38] they will stay there and eat on that
[34:41] food amen
[34:42] anybody said he's seen the lab one of
[34:44] the last things that he'd seen was that
[34:46] he was trying to
[34:47] store cabbage and all kinds of good
[34:49] fruit and he was just storing up a lot
[34:50] of good food
[34:51] amen so you know i don't know if it
[34:54] meant better band was going to cross
[34:56] over that he's going to go away and
[34:57] before he goes away needs to start food
[34:58] i don't know
[34:59] but i do know that i believe that this
[35:01] message even this message is
[35:03] part of that food that he was talking
[35:05] about are you with me tonight
[35:08] i believe that was one of the things
[35:09] that we store up and we can feed on it
[35:11] and we can enjoy ourselves and it can
[35:13] make us what we are to be
[35:15] amen now brother branham here talking
[35:17] about how that
[35:19] how that and what what he had in mind
[35:20] and we all to know that he talked about
[35:23] a solar system that he actually was
[35:25] looking at the stars and he was looking
[35:26] at the galaxies and so forth
[35:28] and he'd seen the stars the moon and all
[35:31] of the things that are in their place
[35:33] and how they stay in their place and as
[35:35] long as they stay in their place
[35:38] everything is nice everything is the way
[35:40] that it's supposed to be
[35:41] in other words the moon controls the
[35:43] tide if the moon was to shift
[35:45] or anything would take place the tides
[35:47] would come in and the earth would be
[35:49] covered with water there'd be chaos
[35:51] he said if one of those would get out of
[35:52] their place because one
[35:54] affects the other amen and so and then
[35:57] he went into there and of course
[35:59] he went in a lot of different areas but
[36:01] uh that was the main thought that he had
[36:04] and he compared also he also compared
[36:06] that
[36:07] with uh with an army that that would be
[36:09] god's great army that as long as every
[36:11] stand but he stands at their post of
[36:13] duty
[36:14] and then all of those sell that get
[36:16] holds everything together
[36:18] but if one would get out of order it
[36:20] would cause
[36:21] chaos it would be a disorder isn't that
[36:23] right
[36:25] amen so now he makes a statement he says
[36:27] you know
[36:28] uh this is a quote we're familiar with
[36:30] but i want to read it he says now
[36:31] you know we've had wars after wars and
[36:34] rumors of wars and if the earth stands
[36:36] we'll have
[36:36] plenty more wars amen how many knows
[36:40] we're having a whole lot right now
[36:42] it meant people battling and fighting
[36:44] and all kinds of stuff going on
[36:46] everything that goes on but do you
[36:48] realize there's really only two powers
[36:50] in the universe
[36:51] and all of our differences between
[36:52] nations and difference between each
[36:54] other
[36:55] and everything it all amounts to either
[36:58] two powers
[36:59] there's only two powers and there's only
[37:00] two kingdoms two powers and two kingdoms
[37:03] all the rest of the little minor things
[37:05] are connected to with either one of
[37:06] those powers
[37:08] and those powers are god's power and
[37:11] satan's power amen
[37:15] i like the simplicity of it don't you
[37:17] think
[37:18] everything our all of the little things
[37:21] in our life everything
[37:22] uh you know every it's all no matter how
[37:24] little it is it's either controlled by
[37:26] god's power
[37:27] or it's controlled by satan's power
[37:29] there's only two powers
[37:30] so he says in every war every disorder
[37:35] everything that comes along it's either
[37:37] controlled by god's power say
[37:39] [Music]
[37:41] because that's the only two powers there
[37:43] is that's god's power amen that's the
[37:45] power of life
[37:46] and the power of death now
[37:49] i like this he says lord he says if this
[37:52] church
[37:53] right tonight could we be put together
[37:55] and knitted together
[37:57] so that every person would be in one
[38:00] accord
[38:01] with not one shadow of a doubt anywhere
[38:06] amen there would not be
[38:10] a p a feeble person in our midst in
[38:12] another
[38:13] five minutes
[38:16] and there would be nobody here desiring
[38:19] the holy ghost
[38:24] now remember but the man says now look
[38:25] we're standing here right now
[38:27] amen we are standing at the brim right
[38:29] now the two
[38:30] powers he says the battle between faith
[38:33] and doubt
[38:34] amen they're fixing to go into rey
[38:36] they're fixing to go at war
[38:38] because for one thing there was this
[38:39] young lady that needed healing if she
[38:41] didn't get her healing
[38:42] she was going to die and so forth and he
[38:45] knew that
[38:46] the battle between faith and doubt that
[38:48] it's a battle that has been raging
[38:50] since the garden of eden i mean it's a
[38:53] battle that's been going on since the
[38:55] very beginning
[38:56] and every generation has had to face
[38:59] this
[39:00] battle had to battle this battle
[39:02] everybody has to either
[39:04] live by doubt or live by faith
[39:07] amen amen and ultimately
[39:10] either controlled by doubt or couldn't
[39:12] control by god's word
[39:14] and faith amen i my mind just went to
[39:17] uh every every generation especially
[39:19] like when jesus
[39:20] was here with the the scribes and the
[39:22] pharisees they had to choose they had to
[39:24] make up their mind
[39:25] what they're going to believe now now
[39:28] furthermore
[39:29] one thing that i the direction that i'd
[39:31] like to go maybe with just a little bit
[39:33] amen because we're also we realize that
[39:36] uh you could also type and if i was to
[39:38] type this here and look at this
[39:39] i mean it would be like you know because
[39:42] our house here
[39:43] our this body that you're looking at you
[39:45] know that this is considered or
[39:48] it can be looked at it as a house amen
[39:52] as a house or a building you know just
[39:54] like the goodman of the house because
[39:57] this is a house someone knows you are a
[39:58] house your body is your house
[40:00] if this house of this earthly tabernacle
[40:02] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[40:04] in other words if this house
[40:05] gets dissolved we haven't so we look at
[40:07] this house and then we know that the
[40:09] prophet told us that
[40:10] inside of this house there's many doors
[40:12] there's a bedroom door there's a kitchen
[40:14] door there's a living room door
[40:15] and then the private life door and all
[40:18] all kinds of different doors in here
[40:19] that's why i preached on the message
[40:21] doors indoor because he realized in this
[40:22] house
[40:23] there's a lot of different faction that
[40:24] goes along
[40:26] amen and so you know and i look at it
[40:29] because
[40:30] uh you know in this house in this and i
[40:32] looked at it even as a ship this is like
[40:34] a ship
[40:35] because how many knows that we want him
[40:36] to be the captain of our ship
[40:38] amen so and in every ship there's a
[40:41] powerhouse there's
[40:42] a place where the engine room is you
[40:44] know typing
[40:45] amen down on the inside of the inside
[40:47] brother bam says we're like a egg
[40:49] or a pulp and so forth even though you
[40:52] have the outer shell you have the inner
[40:53] shell and then you have the
[40:54] all the way on the inside which is the
[40:56] seed the soul
[40:58] and that right he also type us with that
[41:00] many different things we could type us
[41:01] ourselves with
[41:02] a vessel a vessel of honor amen that's
[41:04] why i said a ship
[41:05] it's a vessel amen and so in this here
[41:08] we realize that
[41:09] if you look at it as as being a amen
[41:12] that he's got to have that powerhouse
[41:13] amen it's got to have a a wheel where it
[41:16] turns isn't that right
[41:17] and we will not jesus on the on the
[41:19] wheel of our heart
[41:21] to turn us left turn us right or turn us
[41:23] whichever way we go
[41:24] because we want him to be the captain in
[41:26] that right and then there's a little
[41:28] rudder back there
[41:29] brother even even james talked about he
[41:31] says look at the ships and look at the
[41:33] rudders
[41:34] how great the big difference that makes
[41:36] just to have that little small
[41:38] rudder but it controls that whole ship
[41:40] and the direction that it goes
[41:42] and that's the way your life is that's
[41:44] the way my life is amen it depends on
[41:46] who's at the wheel and which way
[41:48] it's causing that rather to go and it's
[41:50] just the same with faith and doubt you
[41:52] know that's like the rudder whichever
[41:53] way you're going to go
[41:55] if you lean charged out guess what
[41:56] you're going to go towards
[42:00] shipwreck and then you go towards faith
[42:02] and it'll keep you on your destination
[42:05] but it's a complex situation this house
[42:07] is a complex
[42:09] house right
[42:12] it's it's got a lot of different
[42:14] factions to it
[42:16] amen just as the solar system does all
[42:19] right just as a local body does
[42:21] all right this house has a lot of a lot
[42:23] of different things about it
[42:24] and i want to go through it maybe with
[42:26] the help of the lord
[42:28] amen just slow down and just really
[42:30] maybe look at some of these things
[42:32] because we realize the great battle of
[42:34] course you know that goes on
[42:36] uh first of all let me just say this we
[42:38] realize that now i want to look at this
[42:40] again tonight the reason i
[42:41] kind of believe that the holy spirit led
[42:43] me to lean this way
[42:44] is because truly if the greatest battle
[42:47] that was ever fought is where
[42:52] not off somewhere it's there with you
[42:56] the battle is right with you that's what
[43:00] the greatest battle is is
[43:02] right in your mind right and then the
[43:06] other
[43:06] thing is is your greatest
[43:10] enemy is yourself
[43:14] so if the greatest battle ever took
[43:16] place if the greatest enemy you have is
[43:18] right here
[43:18] you don't have to look very far you
[43:20] ain't got to look at everything else
[43:22] right here is where the ballast bomb is
[43:23] going to be
[43:25] oh my brother bam he got to talking
[43:28] about hesis when you can get everything
[43:30] lined up
[43:31] when you can get every shadow of a doubt
[43:32] and everything lined up
[43:34] he says uk nobody need holy ghost
[43:37] anybody that needed healing could get it
[43:40] if you could get it all straightened out
[43:41] and lined up you get
[43:43] this complex ship to run the way it's
[43:45] supposed to run
[43:47] amen so we realized that the greatest
[43:51] battle it's the battle that was fought
[43:53] at the beginning now
[43:54] let me say this first of all satan
[43:57] doesn't change his tactics a whole lot
[44:01] huh the very that's why brother bannon
[44:04] listens to the end of his messages he
[44:06] talked about eve all the time
[44:08] always talking about adulterous even how
[44:10] did she disbelieve the word of god isn't
[44:11] that right
[44:13] and all these other all the facts you
[44:15] know how that he talked about
[44:17] leading to your own understanding and
[44:18] the power of reasoning
[44:20] amen being one of the deadliest things
[44:22] that the devil can use against you
[44:25] that the eve opened up her mind to
[44:28] reasoning
[44:29] isn't that right she opened up her mind
[44:32] amen and the first thing that the devil
[44:34] did was place
[44:35] in there doubt in god's word
[44:37] [Music]
[44:39] amen begin to reason now that's what
[44:41] changes now he knows
[44:43] and reasoning and i want to go through
[44:44] reason he mentioned conscience
[44:46] affections if we have time tonight if
[44:47] you have till 10 o'clock
[44:52] all right so anyway so reasoning being
[44:54] one of those
[44:55] one of those senses that we have it was
[44:57] an avenue or a gate but abandoned called
[45:00] it channels how many knows brother bob
[45:01] says we have a lot of channels
[45:03] now in this house there's a lot of what
[45:05] we might say
[45:06] doorways there's a back door there's a
[45:08] sideboard there's a
[45:09] uh you know back porch doors or each
[45:12] side a lot of doors that we have a lot
[45:13] of points of
[45:14] entry in this house and i would call
[45:17] those points of
[45:18] entry ck feel here and smell conscience
[45:21] reason memory affection
[45:23] amen and all those things it's all
[45:25] points those are all
[45:26] places that you've got to guard against
[45:30] really tonight's service it's about it
[45:32] it is about coming to the place that god
[45:34] has supreme control
[45:36] it's actually perhaps desiring for us
[45:39] to come to the place that we could get
[45:42] everything so lined up
[45:45] that these things would happen
[45:48] come to the place where better man talk
[45:50] about when you've got this
[45:51] amen amen you've got the good men of the
[45:53] house when you've got him that
[45:54] the faith there to watch everything
[45:57] it'll believe
[45:58] yet the devil do where he don't know
[46:00] what to do with you
[46:03] let me say this also towards the end of
[46:05] the sermon he brought it in beautifully
[46:06] how he says you know because we are
[46:08] really supposed to be dead
[46:10] the old us is supposed to be there and
[46:13] he talked about your conscience primary
[46:15] reasoning sex and all of that
[46:17] if any of those things ever tell you
[46:20] something contrary to the word of god
[46:23] you're to cast it out am i right because
[46:28] the second you open any of those
[46:30] up the devil came right in and as
[46:33] brother bam called it he'll clog up your
[46:35] flues
[46:36] or your pipes so to speak the channel in
[46:38] which the holy spirit can freely flow
[46:41] amen
[46:42] just like in the house you've got lines
[46:44] that ain't nothing worse than having a
[46:46] clogged line
[46:47] you know you can't get no water the
[46:48] pipes are you know froze up there
[46:51] they're clogged up and that's the way it
[46:52] is in this house amen
[46:54] the devil has a way to doing that amen
[46:57] that's what his that's how he operates
[47:00] amen
[47:01] but i'm i'm glad i'm bad for this one
[47:03] thing you know what i'm glad for
[47:06] that the thing
[47:09] oh my the thing that controls faith or
[47:12] doubt
[47:14] what controls faith or doubt
[47:27] what you feed on yeah not really what
[47:30] i'm looking for
[47:34] well i'll say this
[47:38] it's the seed the seed that you are
[47:43] amen you know it's
[47:47] what's way down what you really are
[47:50] because if you're a child of god what
[47:51] are you going to do
[47:53] you're going to believe god tried his
[47:56] best to get cain to believe
[48:00] did he get it done no because he was who
[48:04] he was
[48:05] staying in the way with judas he was
[48:07] born the son of perdition
[48:10] amen even jesus said there's children of
[48:13] god and there's children of the wicked
[48:15] one
[48:17] the same opportunity is given to them
[48:19] but the thing that's going to
[48:20] ultimately be dominant the thing that's
[48:22] going to control
[48:24] whether you believe or not is the seed
[48:26] that's on the inside
[48:29] amen praise the lord
[48:33] just sit don't get too excited because
[48:36] when you think about it when you think
[48:38] about hey
[48:40] i'm a believer i believe in all my heart
[48:43] that means
[48:43] i bought it oh you ought to be you gotta
[48:45] make you the happiest person in the
[48:46] world
[48:49] to believe that you are god's child
[48:52] that your son and all of god that you
[48:53] have the ability to believe
[48:56] blessed are your eyes for they see
[48:58] blessed are your ears for the year
[49:00] isn't that right he says you're blessed
[49:02] blessed he are they which hear the words
[49:04] of the prophecy of this book
[49:06] blessed are they that read this isn't
[49:07] that right those that can receive
[49:10] believe it are really really blessed
[49:14] amen this is certainly
[49:18] about us as christians living in
[49:21] heavenly places
[49:24] in the midst of the most evil age
[49:27] ever and yet the most depressing
[49:31] age that were that we could ever live
[49:34] even watching our own nation crumbling
[49:40] crumbling like all those other countries
[49:43] that we have watched crumble
[49:44] we're watching our country crumble
[49:49] all the disrespect and all of that
[49:50] that's all part of the crumbling
[49:53] isn't that right it's gonna crumble it's
[49:54] going to fall
[49:56] it's going to collapse but in the midst
[49:59] of it all
[50:00] amen we don't have our eyes on those
[50:02] things
[50:03] we've got our eyes on lord i'm looking
[50:06] for you to come and take me home one of
[50:07] these days
[50:08] anytime now what did jesus say blessed
[50:11] are those servants who are waiting
[50:14] and watching what do you say he said
[50:16] wait just be there
[50:17] and wait and that's what i want us to do
[50:19] every one of us will be ready
[50:21] in watching and waiting
[50:25] i mean there's no sense in waiting
[50:27] there's no sense in watching
[50:29] if you're not ready because you're going
[50:32] to miss it you got to first of all be
[50:33] ready and then watch
[50:36] and wait for him to come at any time
[50:40] amen praise the lord
[50:43] so every disorder and everything that
[50:46] comes
[50:47] along amen
[50:50] let's go through see takes feeling heat
[50:52] and smell for a minute shall we
[50:56] part of our house the thing that we have
[50:59] to learn to control
[51:01] how many believes that the one thing
[51:03] that you're going to have to do is whip
[51:04] yourself
[51:05] you have to have to overcome yourself
[51:07] you're going to have to come here
[51:08] overcome your eyes am i right
[51:12] now if your eyes are doing what they're
[51:15] supposed to do and they're not out of
[51:16] order
[51:17] amen like the song says my eyes were
[51:19] made to read his holy word
[51:22] i mean there's things that you need to
[51:25] look upon
[51:26] and there are some things that you need
[51:27] to turn your head from
[51:31] amen because if you look at the wrong
[51:33] thing it will bring disorder
[51:35] and it'll bring the devil right into
[51:36] your heart
[51:38] it'll whip you of your victory
[51:41] isn't that right it'll rob you of your
[51:45] joy
[51:45] just by looking at the wrong thing
[51:49] how many is glad to have a house i'm
[51:51] glad to have this house and i'm glad to
[51:53] have windows
[51:54] in this house how many knows close your
[51:56] eyes
[51:57] huh man somebody pulled the blinds down
[52:01] it's awful dark it is out that's right
[52:04] all of a sudden you just pull the blinds
[52:06] down and hey there ain't no look at an
[52:08] ain't no look
[52:09] and listen if what what where what kind
[52:11] of a world would it be
[52:14] you couldn't hardly have a job you
[52:16] couldn't go nowhere
[52:19] you'd have to feel everywhere with your
[52:21] foot
[52:23] isn't that right if you couldn't see
[52:26] how many thankful to be able to see but
[52:29] there's a second seeing
[52:31] the bible talked about not to sing but
[52:33] they see not
[52:34] eyeing eyes they don't see and so forth
[52:36] but understand to understand something
[52:39] and that's in the spirit realm to be
[52:41] able to understand oh i see
[52:44] like fan crosby she would rather brother
[52:46] bram she said i would a whole lot rather
[52:48] be naturally blind
[52:51] than spiritually blind
[52:56] but somebody asks fanny cosby i believe
[52:58] one time she was blind
[52:59] he says fanny how are you gonna how are
[53:01] you gonna see him how are you gonna know
[53:03] him
[53:03] when you get over there if you can't see
[53:07] i don't know if she had the answer right
[53:09] away or not
[53:10] but she probably went back and she began
[53:12] to pray about how am i going to see
[53:15] she probably come under inspiration
[53:16] she's just
[53:19] oh i shall know him i shall know
[53:23] him and redeem by sight i shall stand
[53:29] why shall know him i shall know him
[53:34] by the prince of the scars in his hand
[53:41] hey i'll get to feel him if nothing else
[53:44] she'll know him inspiration she was
[53:47] better off
[53:48] being blind and knowing god and having
[53:52] her eyes open
[53:54] amen so sight eyesight
[53:58] we were meant to look upon god's word
[54:01] amen
[54:03] just to be able to see what a blessing
[54:05] it is
[54:06] because we certainly couldn't contact
[54:09] this world
[54:10] properly without our eyes
[54:16] now all of these things was made so that
[54:17] we can actually
[54:19] function properly number two
[54:23] taste taste
[54:27] amen i guess some of them
[54:31] say that when you have this coconut some
[54:33] of you i guess
[54:34] experience you can't taste anything you
[54:36] never i can't smell or taste it
[54:38] huh i guess the only time you would eat
[54:42] would be
[54:43] if uh you got your summer card is
[54:44] growling right
[54:46] because you wouldn't eat it just for the
[54:48] taste
[54:49] now how many knows it you know that when
[54:51] you just get carried away with your
[54:53] taste
[54:54] god give us a taste because how many
[54:56] knows look at all the people that go to
[54:58] restaurants all the time
[55:00] look at all the good food they want to
[55:01] buy and they want they want it just
[55:02] right
[55:03] they want meat just i said medium rare
[55:06] not rare
[55:06] you know and boy oh boy i can't imagine
[55:08] trying to make everybody happy because
[55:10] you know all of us probably have a
[55:11] medium rare
[55:12] different yeah it's going to be a little
[55:14] different so it'd be hard being a cook
[55:16] but because we want taste has a major
[55:19] part in our life
[55:21] it's the way that we taste things and so
[55:22] forth but the bible says oh taste and
[55:25] see that the lord is good there's a
[55:26] spiritual tasting also
[55:28] amen but we are so around around the
[55:31] taste and most how many knows that
[55:33] that's pr that's why there is a disorder
[55:35] people have a disorder
[55:37] because of their taste gets away from
[55:40] them and they can't stop eating because
[55:42] it tastes so good
[55:44] huh a disorder
[55:48] because you can't stop eating him people
[55:49] can't stop eating
[55:51] hey i know when i get a little 10 extra
[55:54] pounds
[55:54] and i make more room for more it's
[55:57] easier to eat more
[55:59] hey i went into free fridge freezer
[56:02] today you know and i'll tell you what
[56:04] there's about
[56:04] i don't know i'm gonna tell you how much
[56:06] ice cream was left in that tub
[56:09] you know when i go to eat ice cream
[56:11] butter bottle has a little disorder
[56:14] he eats again but listen you know i mean
[56:17] think about it you know god give us that
[56:19] because
[56:19] if we didn't have that now notice let's
[56:22] go to
[56:23] feel we got to go a long way tonight
[56:26] people are in disorder about feeling
[56:29] because people
[56:30] do drugs and alcohol because why they
[56:32] wanna
[56:33] feel good how many wants to feel good
[56:36] how many likes to feel good it's
[56:38] horrible when you're sick
[56:41] i mean sick it's rolling up oh my it's
[56:44] so miserable
[56:45] it's a miserable time but if everybody
[56:48] wants to feel good
[56:50] amen and that's in the first realm
[56:54] just in the natural realm it's another
[56:56] door isn't that right
[56:58] and and i'll tell you the devil really
[57:00] uses on people
[57:02] you know that's why and that's not
[57:04] necessarily the reason why people drink
[57:05] and do all that
[57:06] it does perhaps give them a good feeling
[57:08] but we have been taught by the prophet
[57:10] it's because there's something
[57:11] on the empty on the inside amen
[57:16] even jesus says why do you eat things
[57:18] and and drink and so forth that don't
[57:20] satisfy come to me
[57:22] and i'll give you food god will satisfy
[57:26] you amen drink that'll quench your
[57:29] thirst
[57:30] amen here let's go with here
[57:34] now he knows that we're affected greatly
[57:36] by the things that we hear
[57:39] because everything that you hear
[57:43] goes into your mind and it has to be
[57:46] perhaps uh analyzed
[57:50] is that right you're analyzing
[57:52] everything is
[57:53] you know and if you hear something
[57:54] that's not quite con
[57:56] according to the word you're going to
[57:57] hear that people on the music and
[58:00] because of
[58:01] how music makes people feel amen rock
[58:03] and roll and all of that stuff
[58:06] hello
[58:09] well rock and roll don't really affect
[58:12] you let me tell you when i was out in
[58:13] the world
[58:14] uh you know because brother brown said
[58:16] if you don't get the holy ghost young
[58:17] people
[58:18] that rock and roll will catch you
[58:21] but i'm pretty much gonna say this
[58:22] tonight i'm gonna say that rap music
[58:26] some of that rap music is that right
[58:28] that's what's catching most people
[58:29] nowadays because the music has
[58:31] completely changed from what i
[58:33] understand
[58:34] amen from what it was in my day amen
[58:37] i'll tell you what we all know that when
[58:39] we go to a place and they're singing
[58:41] certain songs
[58:42] that you remember that that person
[58:44] probably has to be about 50 50
[58:46] 60 years old because that's what they
[58:48] liked
[58:49] they don't want all this news that's
[58:51] their time era that was their young age
[58:54] you know right and it will catch you but
[58:56] then says it'll catch you
[58:57] the things that you hear but at the same
[58:59] time remember this
[59:00] the bible says that faith comes by
[59:02] hearing amen
[59:04] hearing the word of god and it has come
[59:06] saying to your eardrum
[59:08] it also has to drop further down than
[59:10] just your eardrum it's got to be dropped
[59:11] down into your heart you got to be able
[59:13] to hear it
[59:15] but hearing amen
[59:20] because eve now listen faith comes by
[59:23] hearing
[59:24] and can i say this that doubt comes by
[59:26] hearing also
[59:28] doubt come by hearing because say i mean
[59:32] eve listened to the devil
[59:35] the serpent she listened to the serpent
[59:38] about what he had to say
[59:40] amen doubt came in
[59:43] and so let me just say this not only
[59:45] this but
[59:46] i guess we'll get it into it reasoning
[59:48] in memory let's get into me reasoning
[59:50] memory
[59:50] of how the devil how many knows the
[59:52] devil will talk to us
[59:54] thoughts in thought form thoughts will
[59:56] come into our minds
[59:58] amen and you have to be careful because
[1:00:02] it'll be either god's thought or it'll
[1:00:04] be the devil thought so faith comes by
[1:00:06] hearing
[1:00:06] the word smell
[1:00:12] i don't have to too much on that but
[1:00:15] you know we certainly like good smells
[1:00:18] don't we
[1:00:19] we certainly don't like bad smells but
[1:00:20] we like things for the smell good but
[1:00:22] that's just another taste
[1:00:23] let's go down to this the next five that
[1:00:25] was the outside realm
[1:00:27] that was his actual body that's this
[1:00:28] right here see
[1:00:30] taste feel hear and smell
[1:00:34] that's the outside body that's our house
[1:00:36] amen
[1:00:37] how many knows you really need faith to
[1:00:39] guard against some things
[1:00:41] because you'll go people will do crazy
[1:00:44] stuff to feel good
[1:00:46] isn't that right amen and the things
[1:00:49] that they see they want to see this they
[1:00:51] want to see that
[1:00:52] now in the other spirit
[1:00:56] realm on our in our spirit realm there's
[1:00:58] reasoning
[1:00:59] memory conscience
[1:01:03] affection and imagination
[1:01:07] amen reasoning let's go with reasoning
[1:01:11] for just a minute
[1:01:13] reasoning what actually puts you
[1:01:17] above the animal kingdom amen
[1:01:21] that's why i don't care how smart the
[1:01:23] animal is we can outsmart them
[1:01:26] they don't have the reason they have
[1:01:27] their nature that they go to
[1:01:29] whatever they do they do by nature we
[1:01:31] all know that there's a lot of animals
[1:01:33] that are a lot smarter
[1:01:34] some are that are smarter than others
[1:01:36] but they all have a routine
[1:01:38] amen but listen puts us above that
[1:01:42] it also allows us to progress
[1:01:45] scientifically
[1:01:47] amen how many knows that those lights
[1:01:50] are the product of somebody being able
[1:01:52] to think and reason
[1:01:55] figure things out amen reasoning
[1:01:59] but it's also the very thing that satan
[1:02:01] uses
[1:02:02] to bring doubt into people's minds
[1:02:06] now that's one of the you know faith
[1:02:09] doesn't have any reasoning at all
[1:02:12] i said a while ago that satan doesn't
[1:02:14] really change his tactics isn't that
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:17] and i want to say this that god really
[1:02:20] doesn't change
[1:02:21] his weaponry his weaponry never has to
[1:02:25] be improved upon
[1:02:27] god's weaponry don't never have to be
[1:02:29] improved upon
[1:02:30] amen just like faith but says get faith
[1:02:33] which is an atomic bomb
[1:02:36] that's what faith is it's the equivalent
[1:02:38] to an atomic bomb
[1:02:39] in other words it was that at the
[1:02:40] beginning it's that at the end it's
[1:02:42] always
[1:02:43] equal in power it's a superpower
[1:02:46] amen now notice so reasoning to decide
[1:02:51] or to figure it out
[1:02:54] and because eve used this reasoning
[1:02:58] in the wrong way and we you and i
[1:03:01] also every day and i want you to know
[1:03:05] how i
[1:03:05] i that this battle that we're in brother
[1:03:08] bam says that this is an
[1:03:09] every day battle that you and i face
[1:03:14] every day amen you got to have your
[1:03:17] guard up
[1:03:18] every single day you have to have that
[1:03:20] faith there
[1:03:21] in every one of these channels if faith
[1:03:24] isn't there
[1:03:25] to watch out to make sure it's according
[1:03:27] to the word is it according to the word
[1:03:29] or isn't it
[1:03:30] amen if it isn't and if you slack up the
[1:03:35] devil will slip
[1:03:36] right in and he'll get you you'll be
[1:03:39] you'll defeat it but ibrahim says you
[1:03:41] know if you uh if to
[1:03:42] eve to disbelieve one word took her to
[1:03:44] death
[1:03:45] amen and if and it disarmed her not only
[1:03:48] disarmed
[1:03:50] but it also took away her shield her
[1:03:53] protection
[1:03:54] and i talked about that because this
[1:03:56] good man of the house
[1:03:58] remember what he does he protects
[1:04:01] he's a protector i mean believes faith
[1:04:04] is
[1:04:04] a protector it keeps you protected from
[1:04:08] all kinds of harm even death
[1:04:12] taking the shield of faith where with ye
[1:04:15] shall be able to quench
[1:04:17] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:04:21] amen how do these fiery darts come in
[1:04:23] here
[1:04:24] by the things that you may not need to
[1:04:27] look at
[1:04:27] amen things that you don't need to feel
[1:04:31] amen things you don't need to hear
[1:04:33] reasoning that you don't need to do
[1:04:35] god's word said cast down reasoning let
[1:04:38] me just read this real quick like
[1:04:41] in uh ii corinthians this is paul's
[1:04:43] version of
[1:04:44] of uh our battle with the flesh
[1:04:48] or in the spirit realm for though we
[1:04:50] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[1:04:52] the flesh
[1:04:53] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:04:55] carnal but mighty through god to the
[1:04:57] pulling down
[1:04:58] of strongholds how many knows that
[1:05:02] everything that we've mentioned about
[1:05:03] there
[1:05:04] if you look at the world and the
[1:05:05] condition that it puts the people in
[1:05:08] you realize that these are really
[1:05:09] strongholds
[1:05:12] your eyesight's a stronghold your mind's
[1:05:14] a stronghold your reasoning is a
[1:05:16] stronghold
[1:05:17] amen your conscience is stronghold your
[1:05:20] hearing is a stronghold
[1:05:21] and satan wants to get in there casting
[1:05:24] down
[1:05:25] imagination and every high thing that
[1:05:28] exalts itself
[1:05:30] against the knowledge of god and
[1:05:32] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:05:34] the obedience of god brother bound says
[1:05:36] if your conscience your memory your
[1:05:38] e-reasoning
[1:05:39] he says they're all wonderful they're
[1:05:41] all good
[1:05:42] in their place but if one of those
[1:05:45] tells you one thing contrary to word
[1:05:48] throw it out
[1:05:50] that's what paul was saying here
[1:05:52] bringing every thought
[1:05:53] captive every high thing that exalts us
[1:05:56] if it's against the knowledge of god
[1:05:58] everything imaginations and so forth
[1:06:01] remember let i'll just i'll just
[1:06:05] jump to imaginations for a second
[1:06:07] imagination
[1:06:08] the bible says that in the days of noah
[1:06:10] god looked down and the imagination of
[1:06:12] man's heart was
[1:06:13] wicked continually
[1:06:17] always thinking the wrong things
[1:06:20] imagining things thinking the wrong how
[1:06:23] many believes it's important to think
[1:06:25] the right thing anytime you think the
[1:06:28] wrong thoughts it's disorder
[1:06:30] and it brings what chaos amen
[1:06:34] imagination so now look at that now
[1:06:38] the other thing i want to do a little
[1:06:39] bit with memory and conscience
[1:06:42] memory either comforts us
[1:06:46] because memory has to do with the past i
[1:06:49] mean his memory has to do with past
[1:06:53] i'll tell you what i got memories that i
[1:06:55] hate to think i don't even try to think
[1:06:57] about it
[1:06:58] you know the only one to think about it
[1:07:03] i'm sure you do too and i try not to
[1:07:06] because it's all under the blood make
[1:07:08] sure it's all under the blood
[1:07:10] amen but our past
[1:07:14] has a lot to do with our conscience now
[1:07:18] how many knows that brother bram talked
[1:07:20] about he says you know
[1:07:22] a woman sometimes they'll say well it
[1:07:23] don't it don't
[1:07:25] it bother my conscience to wear pants to
[1:07:27] smoke could do
[1:07:28] it don't bother me what did he say
[1:07:32] she's got no more conscience than the
[1:07:34] snake has hips
[1:07:38] so in other words some people i know
[1:07:40] some people have their conscience seared
[1:07:44] you know it's that something down there
[1:07:46] that tells you
[1:07:50] you know that you shouldn't have snapped
[1:07:51] at your wife like that
[1:07:53] that you shouldn't have done this little
[1:07:55] thing you know shouldn't have done that
[1:07:56] little thing and
[1:07:57] and your conscience always brings up
[1:07:59] your memory sometimes look at what you
[1:08:01] did
[1:08:01] huh and you know it makes you feel
[1:08:04] terrible you know so you got to watch it
[1:08:06] isn't that right but people don't have a
[1:08:08] conscience anymore
[1:08:10] i don't understand it but brother ma'am
[1:08:12] talked about how that that woman who had
[1:08:14] uh he was supposed to be a christian she
[1:08:16] ended up leaving her
[1:08:17] husband for the nice salesman that comes
[1:08:20] along this side of the other and she was
[1:08:21] still in the church this data the other
[1:08:22] and so forth
[1:08:24] you know come down to the end of the
[1:08:26] road and realize she was not
[1:08:27] saved huh
[1:08:31] brother bram says that she had grieved
[1:08:32] her soul away
[1:08:36] why everybody you know some people just
[1:08:37] don't seem to have a soul they ain't got
[1:08:39] soul
[1:08:40] like hitler how could he have had a soul
[1:08:45] huh this is just to make you wonder a
[1:08:49] little bit
[1:08:50] but i believe the father god said that
[1:08:51] serpent he had a place for the soul but
[1:08:54] he didn't have a soul
[1:08:58] and cain was the son of him but anyway
[1:09:01] think about it grieve that's all the way
[1:09:02] because we're
[1:09:03] the soul is what gives you feeling it's
[1:09:06] what gives you a compassion
[1:09:09] because some people just it says man
[1:09:10] they can do any horror
[1:09:12] thing and it doesn't bother them look at
[1:09:14] the teenagers nowadays going into school
[1:09:17] doesn't even bother them to shoot
[1:09:18] anybody where did they lose some of
[1:09:20] their sensitivity
[1:09:22] on those games seeing the blood splatter
[1:09:25] everywhere when they see it they don't
[1:09:27] think nothing of it
[1:09:29] you know what that one thing i find
[1:09:31] though you know what i find from these
[1:09:32] mass murders and everything
[1:09:34] they don't want the death penalty
[1:09:38] i'll make an agreement just let's not
[1:09:40] have the death penalty
[1:09:42] they want to kill everybody else but
[1:09:43] they're afraid of death themselves
[1:09:46] huh that's sad isn't it
[1:09:50] but people don't have a conscience for
[1:09:53] god now i'll tell you right now how many
[1:09:55] knows that
[1:09:56] all of these things should be right
[1:09:59] tuned
[1:10:00] in with god and protected by the good
[1:10:03] man of the house
[1:10:05] because god is not in our feeling how
[1:10:07] about feeling
[1:10:09] did i miss one yeah feelings cheetahs
[1:10:12] feel
[1:10:12] but we'll talk about feeling people
[1:10:14] don't have any feelings for each other
[1:10:15] anymore
[1:10:16] the bible says that they would uh
[1:10:19] be without natural affections
[1:10:23] just natural affections like families
[1:10:26] they don't have feelings for each other
[1:10:28] anymore but says
[1:10:29] the neighbors we aren't neighbors like
[1:10:31] we used to be people aren't close to
[1:10:33] each other anymore
[1:10:35] but the bible says be kindly
[1:10:37] affectionate
[1:10:38] one to another i'm if the church of god
[1:10:41] ought to have a lot of love a lot of
[1:10:43] compassion a lot of
[1:10:44] a lot of feeling for each other
[1:10:47] amen because if not it's a disorder why
[1:10:50] do you think uh
[1:10:52] oh my it isn't it's just absolutely
[1:10:55] terrible
[1:10:55] of the the families that are you know
[1:10:58] and the moms and dads and the murderers
[1:11:00] that's going on
[1:11:01] with their own family members people
[1:11:03] don't have no love
[1:11:05] of any more they don't have god anymore
[1:11:09] do you talk about disorder because why
[1:11:12] satan got in there
[1:11:14] not faith they're operated by doubt
[1:11:17] and fear and not by faith
[1:11:21] so conscience amen
[1:11:25] and memory their precious thing to us
[1:11:30] because i think i've i've heard of
[1:11:34] people that most anybody
[1:11:35] most anybody that has went off to war
[1:11:39] and has had to kill people i mean
[1:11:42] everyone in there was hopefully nobody
[1:11:44] has had to kill somebody because
[1:11:46] you might think it was just maybe it was
[1:11:48] i don't know you might it depends on
[1:11:50] what justice it was it was to fix and
[1:11:51] kill somebody else whatever it might be
[1:11:53] but that would that goes on your
[1:11:55] conscience
[1:11:56] you know right amen and uh what is what
[1:11:59] do they call a post-traumatic
[1:12:01] stress syndrome or something
[1:12:05] you know because of the stress because
[1:12:08] of that
[1:12:08] sometimes people you know soldiers and
[1:12:10] so forth they'll wake up in the middle
[1:12:11] of night screaming or whatever and
[1:12:13] oh man it can bother you for a lifetime
[1:12:17] your conscience is a very very precious
[1:12:20] thing
[1:12:20] that's why it's so important that that
[1:12:22] conscience that you have
[1:12:24] is right with god then you can have you
[1:12:26] can go to bed
[1:12:28] and snore like a baby you can get up in
[1:12:31] the morning and say thank you lord jesus
[1:12:32] hallelujah
[1:12:33] it's a wonderful day huh but if you've
[1:12:37] got things that you've done don't if
[1:12:39] you've done things wrong
[1:12:40] if you've got a lot of things that
[1:12:41] you've done wrong that
[1:12:43] is on there unless you get it under the
[1:12:45] blood of jesus christ
[1:12:47] and you know that it's forgiven you so
[1:12:49] many believes that our conscience
[1:12:51] has to be in tune with god i'm here to
[1:12:54] tell you something god is sensitive
[1:12:55] the holy spirit is sensitive
[1:13:00] i mean god is perfect right there's no
[1:13:03] evil in him at all
[1:13:04] he's sensitive so much so that
[1:13:08] brother branham when the beginning of
[1:13:09] his discernment begin to take place
[1:13:11] he says now for everybody don't go out
[1:13:14] and go out the doors and back and forth
[1:13:16] and he says he's sensitive
[1:13:18] amen don't just keep real still real
[1:13:20] quiet
[1:13:22] let him operate i believe that's the way
[1:13:24] our lives should be
[1:13:25] just be real still be real quiet be
[1:13:28] sealed in god be hid in christ all of
[1:13:32] these areas listen this is what you are
[1:13:34] you are seeking your conscience reason
[1:13:36] memory and all of that
[1:13:38] and every bit of that has to be hid
[1:13:41] in god in other words so sealed in god
[1:13:45] the devil can't get in there because you
[1:13:47] know that part of
[1:13:48] the devil not knowing what to do with
[1:13:50] you
[1:13:51] how many wants to be live in the place
[1:13:53] where the devil just don't know how to
[1:13:54] get at you
[1:13:56] amen because we know you know the phrase
[1:13:58] some out boy he did something that just
[1:14:00] got to me he got to me
[1:14:01] yeah that's right the devil found you he
[1:14:04] found where you were still alive he was
[1:14:06] found where
[1:14:07] where your place is that hey that's
[1:14:09] that's where you lose it
[1:14:11] that weak link brother bam talk about in
[1:14:12] the statue of a perfect man
[1:14:14] amen praise the lord
[1:14:18] okay and also
[1:14:21] of course that's memory the things that
[1:14:23] we remember
[1:14:26] and i'll tell you what the best memory i
[1:14:30] have
[1:14:30] is what i remember about god amen what a
[1:14:34] glorious thing
[1:14:36] going down memory lane sometimes
[1:14:39] think of what god has done for me amen
[1:14:42] where he brought me from ice held onto
[1:14:45] me how he's kept me
[1:14:46] great things affection
[1:14:49] we won't stay on this very long this is
[1:14:51] the last of this but infection
[1:14:55] people don't have natural affections
[1:14:57] anymore they don't just have common
[1:14:59] decency anymore they don't
[1:15:00] love each other like they should do
[1:15:02] anymore amen
[1:15:05] people are hollowed out
[1:15:09] so to speak there's so many people and i
[1:15:11] believe this is
[1:15:12] with elvis presley it's with
[1:15:16] uh what was his name michael and michael
[1:15:20] different ones that odd overdraw on
[1:15:22] drugs and everything they were
[1:15:24] so empty inside they had no feeling
[1:15:28] you realize that people will almost put
[1:15:31] themselves in
[1:15:32] physical pain just to try to feel
[1:15:34] something
[1:15:35] people don't feel anything anymore
[1:15:39] that's how far away from god they've
[1:15:41] gotten
[1:15:43] so far away from reality so from
[1:15:46] far from being able to feel for anybody
[1:15:48] think nobody feels for them
[1:15:50] it'd be a terrible place to live but
[1:15:53] that's where
[1:15:53] satan has got them
[1:15:57] remember this
[1:16:02] satan's army he says
[1:16:06] brings diseases that's what he is he's a
[1:16:09] destroyer
[1:16:11] satan's whole kingdom is a kingdom of
[1:16:14] sickness and death
[1:16:15] and sorrow and frustrations and worry
[1:16:18] it's all of satan god is life and faith
[1:16:22] and joy and peace on the other side
[1:16:26] and listen god's army
[1:16:29] and god's army is commissioned to cast
[1:16:31] satan's diseases and everything out
[1:16:33] there you are
[1:16:34] every time satan throws something on to
[1:16:36] you god's army is to cast him out amen
[1:16:39] cast it out
[1:16:40] that's the very tactic that god uses
[1:16:43] kate
[1:16:43] satan used the army of destruction to
[1:16:46] disbelieve god's word
[1:16:48] to set him up a better kingdom than
[1:16:50] michael had god cast him out his method
[1:16:52] is to cast out
[1:16:53] cast down region cast down superstition
[1:16:56] cast down worry
[1:16:57] cast down disease cast down sin amen
[1:17:00] you're above it you're resurrected in
[1:17:04] jesus christ and setting
[1:17:05] in heavenly places with every devil
[1:17:08] under your foot
[1:17:14] glory how many is glad to be there i
[1:17:16] hope you're there tonight amen you're
[1:17:18] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[1:17:20] jesus
[1:17:21] you're hid you're you are dead and your
[1:17:23] life is hitting christ
[1:17:25] the devil don't know how to find you he
[1:17:27] tried your eyesight
[1:17:29] he tried church he takes the other he
[1:17:31] may try every avenue and he just can't
[1:17:33] get to you
[1:17:36] that's how we need to be how many
[1:17:38] believes that
[1:17:40] we need to have every one of those
[1:17:41] things guarded have that good man
[1:17:44] of faith right there standing there
[1:17:47] guarding so that the devil has no avenue
[1:17:51] in
[1:17:52] having done all to stand stand therefore
[1:17:56] having your long and scared about with
[1:17:58] truth and heaven on the breastplate of
[1:17:59] faith and so forth
[1:18:00] paul said he says once you get there it
[1:18:02] means stand there
[1:18:05] and as i get older as i get older i mean
[1:18:07] there's a lot of those feelings and
[1:18:09] emotions and things that i don't have to
[1:18:10] deal with as much as what you did as a
[1:18:12] teenager
[1:18:12] as a teenager and as a young person
[1:18:15] you'll find out that your emotions
[1:18:17] are erratic sometimes now they're just
[1:18:20] way out there you got to get control of
[1:18:22] them you got to get
[1:18:24] control of this feeling you got to get
[1:18:25] control of this emotion
[1:18:27] huh because you're on fire
[1:18:30] amen and if you don't pray a lot and
[1:18:33] keep faith there
[1:18:35] amen you better watch out because satan
[1:18:36] is a destroyer
[1:18:38] even the bible says that the enemy comes
[1:18:41] in not but to kill and to steal
[1:18:45] and to destroy that's what jesus said
[1:18:47] that satan does that's the only thing he
[1:18:48] knows to do
[1:18:49] is to come in and make the world look
[1:18:51] like it is
[1:18:54] there's you know it's hard to find
[1:18:56] people that are the same that stay the
[1:18:58] same
[1:18:59] huh everybody's changing families
[1:19:02] changed
[1:19:02] churches changed individuals saying
[1:19:04] people change all the time but i
[1:19:06] guarantee you if you're in christ
[1:19:08] you'll change into a better person but
[1:19:11] you're not going to change into
[1:19:12] something worse
[1:19:14] a worse person no a church the same way
[1:19:16] look at where the churches have gone
[1:19:18] why because in one of those avenues the
[1:19:20] devil let's come in
[1:19:22] come into reasoning you know this that
[1:19:24] or the other and
[1:19:25] and wade people are coming out
[1:19:27] completely different than what you used
[1:19:29] to be
[1:19:30] like i said this is about standing
[1:19:32] having done all to stand
[1:19:34] stand there for having the goodman of
[1:19:37] the house
[1:19:38] watch in closing i want to talk about
[1:19:41] two things
[1:19:42] our families and a local church body
[1:19:45] a local church body like us in a family
[1:19:50] it's important the father
[1:19:53] of any family does his very best to do
[1:19:56] what keep unity
[1:19:58] keep the family together
[1:20:01] keep the family loving one another
[1:20:05] is that right how many knows that's hard
[1:20:07] thing to do
[1:20:08] it's a hard thing for a mom or a dad to
[1:20:11] do
[1:20:12] and a lot of times it don't work why
[1:20:15] because if those children aren't
[1:20:16] consecrated to god one of those feelings
[1:20:19] one of those places
[1:20:20] is gonna it's gonna become a problem
[1:20:24] huh it's gonna cause people to separate
[1:20:27] it's gonna
[1:20:28] cause hard feelings to come in and
[1:20:31] families don't talk
[1:20:32] and everything else for the longest time
[1:20:34] sometimes and different things
[1:20:35] because of a lack of control
[1:20:38] a lack of a surrendered heart to
[1:20:40] almighty god how many of us that's why
[1:20:42] it's so important
[1:20:44] that's why church is so important
[1:20:47] a pastor's job is to cause every family
[1:20:51] a bunch of different families to stay in
[1:20:54] love
[1:20:55] to stay together how many knows that
[1:20:58] this job isn't the being a pastor isn't
[1:21:01] easy
[1:21:02] having a church isn't easy there's a
[1:21:04] there's a local body
[1:21:06] which is what is what we are but then
[1:21:08] there is the body of christ now he knows
[1:21:11] the body of christ
[1:21:12] is not local it may be there partially
[1:21:15] local
[1:21:16] but the body of christ is universal
[1:21:20] all over the world is the body of christ
[1:21:23] and
[1:21:23] only those that have been baptized into
[1:21:26] the spirit by one
[1:21:28] spirit are we all baptized into one body
[1:21:31] you have to be born again of the spirit
[1:21:33] of god to be a part of that church to be
[1:21:36] a part of that body
[1:21:37] how many believe that i was listening to
[1:21:41] something the other day that i thought
[1:21:42] that would be a blessing to us so i'm
[1:21:43] going to read that
[1:21:44] in closing is this okay it's about a
[1:21:47] local church like us
[1:21:49] and i thank god i want to tell you
[1:21:50] things i thank god for what god
[1:21:52] has done for us and what he does for us

[1:22:45] blood of jesus

[1:22:57] christians that
[1:22:58] love the lord amen and strive to serve
[1:23:00] god
[1:23:01] and i'll read that in a minute he says
[1:23:03] look after making my own
[1:23:05] consecration and after making heaven the
[1:23:08] church to do so
[1:23:09] if god blessed us the way that he has
[1:23:12] the last few meetings
[1:23:14] with a little consecration what will he
[1:23:16] do
[1:23:17] if we keep it up listen what he says

[1:23:24] how many knows when you've made your
[1:23:25] stand where you extremely life to god
[1:23:27] it's a job to stay there
[1:23:30] to keep it up keep pressing on
[1:23:34] because if you do and if you got that a
[1:23:35] good man in the house there the devil
[1:23:37] can't come in
[1:23:38] he can't distract you you won't be one
[1:23:40] person or a christian now and then the
[1:23:42] next day you'll be gone
[1:23:43] it'll stop this you know why can't
[1:23:45] people keep the victory and so forth
[1:23:47] listen keep it up now listen you're in
[1:23:50] love with one another
[1:23:52] how i've seen you standing in the house
[1:23:55] this morning and just
[1:23:56] weep and your hands up to god that
[1:23:59] lovely spirit moving around and over you
[1:24:03] amen then brother baby says listen now
[1:24:06] don't you listen to one foul thing the
[1:24:09] devil's got to say
[1:24:12] he starts telling us how that we can
[1:24:14] remain
[1:24:15] in the holy spirit as a local church
[1:24:18] body
[1:24:19] don't listen to what the devil's got to
[1:24:21] say see if the devil shows you some or
[1:24:23] tells you something evil
[1:24:25] about one of the members of the body of
[1:24:27] christ don't you believe it
[1:24:30] amen for as soon as you do believe it
[1:24:33] you might mar your experience now you
[1:24:36] might say well brother
[1:24:37] what if it's really true listen to what
[1:24:40] you do
[1:24:41] then he says right after that if you see
[1:24:43] one of the members of the body of christ
[1:24:45] doing something evil
[1:24:47] don't tell nobody
[1:24:50] the bible tells me that he that hides
[1:24:52] his sin shall not
[1:24:54] you know be blessed but he says don't
[1:24:58] tell
[1:24:59] nobody but
[1:25:03] amen go to that member and with
[1:25:06] love and see if you can't bring them
[1:25:08] back to christ again
[1:25:11] how many knows that anything outside of
[1:25:13] that
[1:25:14] it'll cause chaos the devil anything

[1:25:23] wrong why don't you go take care of it
[1:25:25] no if you know something you go take
[1:25:28] care of it
[1:25:29] if you can't listen to what it says and
[1:25:30] if you don't can't do it
[1:25:32] then tell one more person and let them
[1:25:34] go with you see that's the scriptural
[1:25:36] way

[1:25:50] order for anything to be bla it's got to
[1:25:52] be according to the word of god anything

[1:27:29] these people that has said you have set
[1:27:31] with in heavenly places with you
[1:27:34] fellowship together around the blessings
[1:27:36] of god taking the communion at the table

[1:27:45] kind-hearted
[1:27:47] forgiving and loving amen
[1:27:50] so if you'll notice he talks about
[1:27:52] people like

[1:27:55] know each other and if we know that one
[1:27:57] of us is evil
[1:27:58] we're going to know that but if we have
[1:28:00] taken communion
[1:28:02] and we know that we're christians and so
[1:28:04] the devil will do let me just say this
[1:28:06] the devil will do everything in his
[1:28:08] power to cause you to try to believe
[1:28:11] that your brother is evil or your sister
[1:28:14] is actually
[1:28:15] evil the devil will try to make you
[1:28:17] think of your brother
[1:28:18] or your sister as evil
[1:28:22] amen but remember be sweet be
[1:28:25] kind-hearted forgiving
[1:28:26] loving let me just say this is a pastor
[1:28:28] i believe if we would do that
[1:28:30] if we see a sister i've when i've talked
[1:28:33] to people my wife's done it
[1:28:34] when you see a sister sometimes maybe or
[1:28:36] it's just not dressed appropriate
[1:28:39] it bothers you he said our sister
[1:28:41] shouldn't do that she's got
[1:28:43] little girls watching and everything
[1:28:44] take her to the side sister just you
[1:28:46] know that
[1:28:46] you're not you know you know and just
[1:28:49] say it love and sweetness
[1:28:50] if you say it love and sweetness come on
[1:28:52] folks we can all handle that right
[1:28:54] somebody says something sweetly kindly
[1:28:56] and not me
[1:29:00] come on folks right praise the lord
[1:29:02] isn't that the truth same
[1:29:03] with us brothers we should be able to go
[1:29:06] to each other say brother
[1:29:09] you know you pull the fast one on me you
[1:29:11] shouldn't have done it
[1:29:14] or or whatever it might be say yeah and
[1:29:17] we got to be honest yeah
[1:29:18] that's right and admit it again and
[1:29:20] that's that'll be the end of it it'll
[1:29:22] all be straightened out get onto the
[1:29:23] blood because if you don't you go to the
[1:29:25] second person and somebody really doing
[1:29:26] evil
[1:29:27] hello they're really doing evil and
[1:29:28] won't repent it's supposed to be brought
[1:29:30] before the church
[1:29:31] they don't hear the church they say hey
[1:29:34] he's not a christian
[1:29:37] his brother's not a christian he will
[1:29:38] not repent that's how it's supposed to
[1:29:40] be done
[1:29:41] amen and i guarantee you if it's a
[1:29:45] genuine brother
[1:29:46] i don't believe he'll go that far amen
[1:29:49] but listen to what he says again you
[1:29:50] with me now
[1:29:51] so now notice witness that they're kind
[1:29:54] of forgiving loving because the devil
[1:29:56] likes to get in every avenue
[1:29:59] and if listen and if that person
[1:30:02] talks evil against you
[1:30:05] maybe there's maybe somebody in the
[1:30:07] church they're saying something evil
[1:30:08] about you
[1:30:09] you talk sweet brother brahm said
[1:30:12] against them
[1:30:14] but it be towers them right watch how
[1:30:16] much sweeter it comes to you then see
[1:30:18] that's right
[1:30:19] just always return good
[1:30:22] for evil i have taught that fear
[1:30:26] for eons of time because i'll be honest
[1:30:27] with you i haven't always been able to
[1:30:29] practice it
[1:30:30] huh that's right but the lord's worked
[1:30:32] on me
[1:30:34] i've got to believe i've gotten to the
[1:30:35] place to where hey you know
[1:30:37] you think bad say bad whatever you call
[1:30:40] me that's fine
[1:30:41] i'm gonna go pray for you because i
[1:30:43] ain't got room to open up for the devil
[1:30:45] to come in here
[1:30:46] and bring bitterness in my heart no
[1:30:48] because that's the exact
[1:30:50] channel that the devil uses so many
[1:30:52] times young people especially listen
[1:30:53] that he'll use that channel
[1:30:55] to get to you and cause you to be
[1:30:57] disturbed
[1:30:59] to upset you have you ever heard the
[1:31:01] word upset i thought about the word said
[1:31:02] well i'm upset if you get upset remember
[1:31:05] it's the devil that upsets you
[1:31:07] god don't upset you the devil upsets you
[1:31:11] amen we shouldn't
[1:31:14] get upset we should stay on our feet
[1:31:16] amen
[1:31:18] all right so now i know just talk real
[1:31:19] sweet back to them that's right just
[1:31:22] always return good for evil love and so
[1:31:24] forth now he says he's talking about a
[1:31:26] little girl are you feeling better about
[1:31:27] now notice what he says now
[1:31:29] brother bam says in closing she says now
[1:31:31] be sure
[1:31:33] to do that pledge yourself
[1:31:36] that to god god by your grace
[1:31:40] that's what i will do how many is with
[1:31:43] me
[1:31:43] god with your help i pledge myself that
[1:31:47] that's what i will do
[1:31:49] if i see a brother or sister amen and
[1:31:51] they aren't doing like they ought to do
[1:31:53] i'll be able to go in kindness and in
[1:31:55] love and seeing brother
[1:31:57] you shouldn't do that sister you
[1:32:00] shouldn't do that
[1:32:02] amen but i won't come to
[1:32:05] somebody else and somebody else and
[1:32:07] spread it around because the devil gets
[1:32:08] into all of that
[1:32:09] because ain't no time you've got that as
[1:32:12] the evil person when they're not
[1:32:15] and when you do that remember this
[1:32:17] brother bam says
[1:32:18] the person that is doing that is the one
[1:32:20] that is wrong
[1:32:22] i'll say this i believe that whatever
[1:32:23] most of the time and i've seen it happen
[1:32:26] as a pastor when that happens the person
[1:32:27] doing it is twice as wrong and bad as
[1:32:30] whatever the person that's doing it
[1:32:32] amen it's a wicked it's bad it can it
[1:32:35] gives
[1:32:36] room for a wicked spirit to come in and
[1:32:38] i know none of us want that amen
[1:32:40] no matter what anybody says evil return
[1:32:43] good don't think evil
[1:32:48] if you think evil then you just keep
[1:32:52] consecrating yourselves to god
[1:32:55] until you can really feel good
[1:32:58] powers that person
[1:33:03] glory i know we all want to be there get
[1:33:05] to the place because
[1:33:06] if you you know the the thing if it is
[1:33:08] is we want to get to thinking evil or or
[1:33:11] thinking bad and
[1:33:12] so forth and then we're the ones that
[1:33:14] end up feeling bad it gives the devil
[1:33:15] room to come and get you
[1:33:17] that's how the devil he comes and gets
[1:33:19] you
[1:33:21] and if but if you just love and if you
[1:33:23] just return good for evil
[1:33:25] he can't touch you what are you going to
[1:33:27] do with that
[1:33:29] ain't nothing the devil can do when you
[1:33:30] do that
[1:33:32] amen okay
[1:33:36] so i thought this was amen good now
[1:33:38] listen
[1:33:40] another thing so you just keep
[1:33:42] consecrating yourself until you feel
[1:33:44] good touch that person that's the way to
[1:33:45] do it
[1:33:46] then the sweetness of god's blessing
[1:33:49] will just oh
[1:33:50] it'll just cover your soul
[1:33:53] how many wants that that's the way to
[1:33:57] live victorious and
[1:34:00] nothing can harm you as long as you're
[1:34:03] in love and don't only love those who
[1:34:07] love you but love those who don't love
[1:34:08] you
[1:34:09] for it's easy to love anybody that loves
[1:34:11] you but try to love somebody who doesn't
[1:34:13] love you
[1:34:14] that's where you can test whether you're
[1:34:16] a christian or not
[1:34:17] somebody that don't love you and yet in
[1:34:20] your heart
[1:34:22] you love them if you don't do that just
[1:34:24] keep holding on to god
[1:34:26] it's there i know that to be the truth
[1:34:29] amen praise the lord all right
[1:34:34] you love the lord tonight how many wants
[1:34:37] to go there how many wants to be in that
[1:34:38] place where
[1:34:39] you know the devil just can't touch you
[1:34:42] you're waiting for the hou you've got
[1:34:45] your house
[1:34:46] control you've got all your guards up
[1:34:48] the devil can't come and find you he
[1:34:50] can't get to you
[1:34:51] he can't touch you why because you're
[1:34:53] hitting christ no matter what comes or
[1:34:55] goes you stay right there
[1:34:57] no matter what anybody does you don't
[1:34:59] ever build up a grievance or a complex
[1:35:01] against them
[1:35:02] amen and no matter what the devil tempts
[1:35:04] you with even in your
[1:35:05] body's realm or your spirit realm
[1:35:08] whether it's memory or whatever it might
[1:35:09] be
[1:35:10] it's all guarded by the goodman of the
[1:35:12] house an
[1:35:14] evening like tabernacle and the saints
[1:35:16] there
[1:35:18] i'll tell you what what i what i'm
[1:35:20] hoping for and believing for
[1:35:22] that we will all be swept up
[1:35:26] all of us i want every one of us to have
[1:35:27] a body change and just
[1:35:29] go in the air and meet the lord in the
[1:35:30] air that's that's my goal for us
[1:35:34] and i believe that this message that god
[1:35:36] sent us through a prophet
[1:35:38] and these messages that he has given us
[1:35:40] is molding us
[1:35:41] and shaping us and sooner or later we're
[1:35:44] going to come to it
[1:35:46] how many believe that the token one of
[1:35:48] these days we're going to have the token
[1:35:49] life and nothing but
[1:35:51] amen we're going to have perfect love
[1:35:53] just like he said we're going to be
[1:35:54] watching and waiting
[1:35:56] for the coming of the lord because he's
[1:35:58] going to come
[1:35:59] because this nation is crumbling it's
[1:36:02] falling apart
[1:36:04] brother branham preached the world
[1:36:06] falling apart and i truly remember
[1:36:08] seeing it face to face that the world is
[1:36:11] falling apart
[1:36:12] and i'll tell you what we need a lift
[1:36:16] we need a body change and in order to
[1:36:20] have that body change
[1:36:22] first god has the changes in here
[1:36:25] amen amen
[1:36:32] amen praise the lord god bless you

[1:37:36] whether it's going to be out of fear and
[1:37:38] doubt frustration
