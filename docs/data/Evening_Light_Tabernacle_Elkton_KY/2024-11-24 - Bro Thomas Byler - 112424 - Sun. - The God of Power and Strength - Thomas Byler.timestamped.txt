[19:09] morning brothers and
[19:10] sisters if we'll just stand this
[19:15] morning maybe brother John Wade w put us
[19:18] in prayer this morning
[19:57] you every
[20:21] expect
[20:44] can be smiss for Sunday school if you'll
[20:47] go in the Psalms with me to Psalm 62
[21:02] Psalm
[21:05] 62 truly my soul waiteth upon God from
[21:09] him my
[21:19] salvation how long will ye imagine
[21:22] Mischief against a man you
[21:26] shall shall you be and as a to in
[21:39] fence my soul wait thou only upon God
[21:43] for my expectation is from
[21:52] him in God is my salvation and my glory
[21:56] the rock of my strength and my Refuge is
[21:59] in
[22:11] God okay I think we're at are we at nine
[22:15] okay surely men of low degree are vanity
[22:18] and Men of high degree are a lie to be
[22:21] laid in the balance they are all
[22:23] together line to theity
[22:34] God hath spoken once twice have I heard
[22:36] this that power belongeth unto
[22:39] God also unto thee O Lord belongeth
[22:43] Mercy for thou renous to every man
[22:45] according to his works for the Brian God
[22:48] bless you may be seated
[23:00] sorry about that Lord bless you
[23:03] all he is a I'm not trying to be a
[23:06] comedian here but I guess as I read that
[23:09] Psalm it it's got the positive and it's
[23:11] got the negative and I was just thinking
[23:14] I guess David had fake news in his day
[23:17] and in his day too but if you would turn
[23:19] to me that's what I was thinking because
[23:21] the opposite is people that deliberately
[23:24] tell you a lie
[23:26] knowing telling you a lie as it's the
[23:29] truth knowing what they're doing trying
[23:32] to deceive people about what really has
[23:35] happened and and that's a horrible thing
[23:37] but if you would turn with me
[23:39] to um math I mean Mark the 9th
[23:44] chapter I was reading this morning in
[23:48] Kings Second Kings
[23:50] also between
[23:52] uh Hezekiah and
[23:56] Manasses and I was just thinking it kind
[23:59] of kind of like where we're at
[24:04] today when we think of our own how you
[24:07] have a high and then you have lows then
[24:09] you have a high and then you have a low
[24:11] you know we went from one president
[24:14] another president but I just look at the
[24:18] scriptures and I look at the message of
[24:20] the and and I know no matter how you
[24:23] might feel things might get better
[24:24] they're not going to get better so it
[24:27] makes us realize not that as Americans
[24:30] we as Patriots we don't want our country
[24:33] to be we all want our country to be
[24:35] successful but we know that it's coming
[24:39] to an end here sooner or real soon and
[24:43] not to be deceived by the world out
[24:45] there as you see time going on it should
[24:48] make us want to get closer to Christ not
[24:50] be further away and I was
[24:55] also you know Manasses was a evil King
[24:59] and I and and when you think as a king I
[25:03] where I'm going here he literally
[25:07] defiled the temple of God that's one he
[25:09] set the clock in order for the for Judah
[25:12] to be taken away in captivity where you
[25:15] went from Hezekiah to Manasses to
[25:18] Manasses son who was assassinated to a
[25:21] good King but when Manasses come into
[25:24] rain that's when God set his clock and
[25:26] that's when the Babylonians and and
[25:29] Isaiah told Hezekiah because he showed
[25:32] all this stuff to the Babylonians God
[25:35] told he told Hezekiah that that Kingdom
[25:38] would come and take Judah into captivity
[25:41] but when Manasses did the things he did
[25:43] he set that clock he said it in order
[25:45] that the children of Israel would be
[25:47] taken into captivity no matter what they
[25:49] did they were going into captivity and
[25:52] it's no different for us this morning
[25:54] the message of hour has come you have
[25:56] the word of God for the hour that we
[25:58] live in this morning and the clock is
[26:00] set and the only thing that's going to
[26:02] help you as
[26:04] a is to realize that there's only one
[26:08] way you're getting out of here in a
[26:10] Rapture that's the only way you're
[26:12] getting out of here and anything else
[26:13] really doesn't matter you know we all
[26:15] want to be successful in our lives but
[26:18] the only thing that matters I know I say
[26:20] this a lot I can't say enough the only
[26:22] thing that matters is is it real to you
[26:26] is the presence of Jesus
[26:29] have you sold out everything for the
[26:32] master this morning that's the only
[26:34] thing that counts this morning any is
[26:36] just father the only thing that really a
[26:40] Believer this morning is to be totally
[26:42] committed to Jesus Christ this morning
[26:44] and all the Loose Ends that might you
[26:47] know like I mean there's numerous
[26:49] examples I can all the loose ends you
[26:51] just need to let him go the only thing
[26:53] that matters is Jesus Christ this
[26:55] morning and I was reading in um Mark 9
[26:59] there was some other things I was going
[27:00] to say about manassis reain but it it
[27:04] goes on in our very n you know they were
[27:07] offering children at sacrifice but they
[27:09] do that all across our country's
[27:12] hospitals are are taking gal off of boys
[27:16] and girls and 100 years ago if a if a a
[27:21] wife and a mother had gone to a doctor
[27:23] and said I want you to cut the genitals
[27:26] off my son or my daughter what do you
[27:28] think think they would have done to that
[27:29] wife or to that father they would have
[27:31] put him in an insane asylum 100 years
[27:33] ago so it just let you know that the
[27:36] world is crazy and the only sane people
[27:39] are Christians this morning and I um
[27:42] I'll start about the uh 38th verse here
[27:47] this morning of the ninth chapter of
[27:51] Mark and he's talking about he takes a
[27:54] child I'll start if I read too much
[27:57] you'll have to forgive me
[27:59] but also I I hadn't even got started but
[28:02] what I'm trying to say that's the age
[28:04] that we live in people desire peace they
[28:07] desire safety they desire security and
[28:11] what are you will for it is what I would
[28:14] ask you what are you willing to sell to
[28:16] have peace and security this morning are
[28:18] you willing to sell your values are you
[28:21] willing to sell your relationship with
[28:23] Jesus Christ this morning to have some
[28:26] peace in the world that we live you're
[28:28] not you're going to cast it all aside
[28:30] you just want what God has for you this
[28:33] morning and do you we're all going to
[28:35] have decision one day what are we
[28:38] willing
[28:39] to where are we going to walk and how
[28:41] are we going to do are we going to sell
[28:44] out in our lives just a little piece or
[28:47] we just going to hold true to the Cross
[28:49] this morning and uh I'll start about
[28:53] the about the 35th verse here
[28:59] about the 30 but they held their Peace
[29:02] by the way they had disputed themselves
[29:04] who should be the greatest that's the
[29:06] world every everyone wants to be better
[29:08] than someone else and he goes on and he
[29:11] sat down and called the TW and said onto
[29:13] them if any man desired to be
[29:17] the all servant of all the servant
[29:20] leadership that's what Christian
[29:22] leadership is and he took a child and
[29:24] set him in the midst of them and when he
[29:27] had taken him in his arms he said unto
[29:29] them whosoever shall receive one of such
[29:32] children in my name receiveth me and
[29:35] whosoever receiveth me receiveth not me
[29:38] but but he excuse me but him that sent
[29:42] me and that's the promise still this
[29:45] morning here John answered him
[29:48] saying we saw one casting out devils in
[29:51] thy name and not us and we forbade him
[29:54] because he followed not us and he goes
[29:57] Jesus goes on to say here Jesus said
[29:59] forbid him not there is no man which
[30:03] shall do a miracle in my name that can
[30:05] lightly speak evil to me so you know you
[30:08] never really want to stop people from
[30:10] being good people good things he go for
[30:13] he that is not against us is is on our
[30:16] part whatso shall give you a cup of
[30:19] water to drink in my name because belong
[30:22] to Christ verily I say unto you he shall
[30:25] not lose his reward doesn't the most
[30:28] important thing no matter what you're
[30:30] doing good things that's great but like
[30:32] I just said in the beginning your
[30:34] heart's got to be right and you've got
[30:36] to be serving to the Lord to make it
[30:38] matter and it goes on whosoever shall
[30:41] offend one of these little ones that
[30:43] believe in me it's better for him that
[30:45] Millstone be hanged about his neck and
[30:47] he into the sea and if they hand If thy
[30:51] hand defend thee cut it off it is better
[30:53] for thee to enter into life M than
[30:56] having two hands and go into h
[30:58] into the fire that never shall be
[31:00] quenched where the worm dieth not and
[31:03] the fire is not
[31:05] quenched um there's a lot of churches
[31:08] out there if you read these scriptures
[31:10] there'd be people that walk out and If
[31:12] thy foot offend thee cut it off it is
[31:14] better for
[31:17] thee halt in life than having two feet
[31:20] be cast into hell into fire that never
[31:22] shall be quenched where the worm dieth
[31:26] not and the fire is not quenched
[31:29] and if thine eye offend thee pluck it
[31:31] out I that's when I think read this
[31:33] scripture I really think we this day age
[31:36] that we live in because you all have
[31:37] tablets you all have smartphones you all
[31:40] have all kinds of it out there and this
[31:43] is where this scripture really comes
[31:45] into this age you got to be careful what
[31:48] your eyes see if thine eye offend thee
[31:51] pluck it out it is better for thee to
[31:52] enter in the kingdom of God with one eye
[31:55] and then having two eyes that be cast
[31:58] into
[31:58] Hellfire and where the worm dieth not
[32:01] but the fire is not quenched for
[32:04] everyone shall and I was just thinking
[32:06] of this this morning the 49th verse to
[32:08] the 50th verse for everyone shall be
[32:11] salted with fire and every sacrifice
[32:13] shall be salted with salt and Jesus goes
[32:16] on to say here salt is good but if the
[32:19] salt have lost its saltiness
[32:22] whereof will you season it have salt in
[32:26] yourselves and have peace one at another
[32:28] and you really need to have God salt in
[32:31] your hearts and lives and I'll just
[32:32] finish with this this
[32:36] morning it's a really I don't want to
[32:39] drop this mic I got notes everywhere but
[32:42] when I think of the where we at this
[32:46] morning I can only speak for myself
[32:49] where my heart is at this morning but I
[32:51] was reading this devotional from this uh
[32:54] uh every
[32:56] morning and uh brother brother brandom I
[32:58] I'll just read what he has and I was
[33:00] just thinking we really need to be dead
[33:02] to the things of this world that doesn't
[33:04] mean you can't enjoy your life you know
[33:07] you don't want to be like like the monks
[33:10] of a thousand years ago doesn't mean you
[33:12] can't enjoy a life but you need really
[33:14] to be dead to the things of this world
[33:16] and alive in the things of Christ and
[33:18] I'll just read this this morning and sit
[33:20] down and this comes out of uh first
[33:23] Peter the 2 chapter the nth verse I'm
[33:25] sure you all know this but you are our a
[33:28] chosen generation you are a chosen
[33:30] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[33:33] nation A peculiar people that you show
[33:36] forth Praises unto whom him who ha
[33:39] called you out of Darkness Into His
[33:41] Marvelous Light and this is what brother
[33:43] brandham had to say about this and U
[33:47] people come in and say them people are
[33:49] crazy well that's what they would say
[33:51] about you too sure they they they are
[33:55] the wisdom of God is foolish to man and
[33:57] the wisdom of man is foolish to God
[34:00] they're contrary one to another and that
[34:02] really true today and he goes but a real
[34:05] Spirit fill Church full of the power of
[34:08] God setting together in Heavenly places
[34:11] offering spiritual sacrifices Praises of
[34:15] God Holy Spirit moving among them
[34:17] Discerning sin and that's really
[34:20] important be able
[34:22] discern the truth from evil evil from
[34:25] good good from Evil discern the sin
[34:27] falling out the things among them that
[34:29] are wrong straighten out making it flat
[34:32] and level you know that's the most
[34:34] important thing about a Christian Life a
[34:36] steady level straight life that's what
[34:39] God wants to see because why always in
[34:41] the presence of God is that Bloody
[34:44] sacrifice you aren't saved by the blood
[34:47] but you're kept by the blood but you are
[34:49] saved by grace through faith believing
[34:52] it and anyone that tells you there isn't
[34:54] salvation in the message has it what
[34:56] brother brandom had to say God knocked
[34:58] at your heart because he predestinated
[35:01] you he he you looked up and believed it
[35:04] and accepted it now the blood makes an
[35:06] atonement for your sins and I'm sure
[35:09] we're all there this morning God does
[35:11] not condemn sinner for sinning and
[35:13] that's true he's a sinner to begin with
[35:15] he can he condemns a Christian for
[35:18] sinning and because he has condemned him
[35:20] Christ took our condemnation so there is
[35:23] no condemnation to them which are in
[35:25] Christ that walk not after the flesh but
[35:29] after the spirit and that's what I was
[35:31] saying earlier you got to push away all
[35:33] those things don't matter and just walk
[35:36] in the spirit this morning if anything
[35:39] wrong it isn't
[35:40] willful you just don't sin willfully a
[35:43] man that sins willfully goes out and
[35:46] willfully sin has never come into the
[35:48] body yet and I'm sure that none of us
[35:51] are there this morning but he goes on to
[35:53] say but a man that once is in there he's
[35:56] dead and his life life is hid in God
[35:58] through Christ SE by the Holy Ghost and
[36:01] the devil can't even find him is that
[36:03] where we are at this morning can the
[36:05] devil find you are you really dead am I
[36:07] really dead this morning so Esau back in
[36:11] there we would have to come out before
[36:14] the devil and never get in you're dead
[36:16] so what he's what he's saying here is
[36:19] your life is so dead to the things of
[36:21] this world that God the devil doesn't
[36:23] even see you this morning he doesn't
[36:25] know where you're at you're so hidden by
[36:27] the blood of Jesus Christ and so sold
[36:29] out to the things of God you're you just
[36:32] almost invisible he goes on to you have
[36:35] come to before and then I lost my place
[36:37] I don't want to reread it tell a Dead
[36:40] Man He's a hypocrite see what happens
[36:42] that and it's really true this morning
[36:45] this is where they really know if you're
[36:46] Christian or not when they start saying
[36:49] evil about you start kicking on you
[36:51] that's when they find out what you
[36:52] really are but then he goes on to say
[36:54] tell a Dead Man He's a hypocrite see
[36:56] what happens kick him on the side and
[36:59] say you old hypocrite you he'll not say
[37:02] a word and that's right he'll just lay
[37:04] there a man that's dead in Christ you
[37:07] can call him a hypocrite you can call
[37:09] him anything you want to he'll never
[37:11] rise up about it if anything he'll slip
[37:15] off somewhere and pray for you that's
[37:17] right I hope that's the way I'll act and
[37:20] but the some but oh some of them very
[37:22] much alive that's what I think about
[37:24] we're supposed to be to bury dead people
[37:27] them that are dead in Christ we bury
[37:29] them in the
[37:30] water sometimes we bury too many people
[37:33] that are alive and that's what's wrong
[37:35] with the world that you have to have
[37:38] that real experience when you go in in
[37:40] the water when you come back up you're
[37:42] not that same person anymore too much
[37:45] malice and strife there's too much in
[37:47] the church but we can't separate that
[37:50] and that's really important you can't
[37:51] make people live life but God has to
[37:54] separate you God has to show them the
[37:56] way what God does he knows his people he
[37:59] knows his he knows every voice he knows
[38:02] his children he knows who he's going to
[38:04] call out he knows who he's going to he's
[38:07] predestinated he he knows who he's given
[38:10] those things to what he's making himself
[38:14] through God puts confidence in his
[38:16] children on what to do knowing that they
[38:19] will do it exactly I would hope this
[38:21] morning that God would have confidence
[38:23] in me and in us as a church this morning
[38:26] that he could give us more
[38:27] I mean there's many blessings out there
[38:29] A lot of times people don't receive it
[38:32] because they're too afraid to reach out
[38:33] for those blessings this morning
[38:36] but I pray that God will touch each of
[38:39] your hearts that you that God will be in
[38:41] this assembly there's many needs this
[38:43] morning we all have heard the needs
[38:45] menant the only we all just have to
[38:48] reach out in faith as brothers and
[38:50] sisters to just reach out to God this
[38:52] morning to receive what he would have
[38:54] for us in this service today David
[39:00] love the Lord this
[39:02] morning amen God bless you it's good to
[39:05] be in the house of the Lord this

[39:15] and going to uh got an announcement this
[39:18] morning and I'll just take care of that
[39:20] because I'm very bad to forget so we
[39:23] won't get into that this morning and uh
[39:26] but there will be no service Wednesday
[39:28] night due to the Thanksgiving holidays
[39:30] coming up we always take that time off

[39:36] appreciate all the Lord's done for us

[1:07:02] families amen and Thanksgiving amen amen
[1:07:07] and so we know that it goes all the way
[1:07:09] back to our forefathers I guess when
[1:07:11] they come over here and if I remember
[1:07:14] right they had a hard time that right
[1:07:17] and so amen they got all the goods and
[1:07:20] different things that they had I guess
[1:07:22] they had to go shoot a turkey because we
[1:07:23] keep shooting turkeys and eat turkeys
[1:07:25] for thankgiving anyway so they uh
[1:07:28] managed to survive it was a hard time
[1:07:30] for them a that right but amen so we
[1:07:32] have a uh Thanksgiving I'm thinking but
[1:07:35] Abraham
[1:07:36] said original holiday American holiday
[1:07:40] ain't that right amen well how many
[1:07:42] knows that uh amen a Believer has also
[1:07:45] we have we have a a Thanksgiving day
[1:07:48] amen it's every day amen we give thanks
[1:07:51] to the Lord in all things give thanks
[1:07:54] amen praise the Lord Lord amen and even
[1:07:57] I believe one place it talks about amen
[1:07:59] that he is worthy of
[1:08:01] thanks how many believes that God is
[1:08:03] worthy of thanks we thank one another
[1:08:06] sometimes but we don't thank him like we
[1:08:08] should amen abam talked about he says
[1:08:11] you went to somebody's house I guess and
[1:08:13] they didn't pray over their food and so
[1:08:15] forth and he reminded of him amen of a
[1:08:18] pig being on the apple tree and eating
[1:08:20] apples just eating apples never looking
[1:08:23] up and being thankful for where it came
[1:08:25] from that right so we are thankful for
[1:08:27] to God Amen because he is worthy of
[1:08:30] thanks and praise honor and glory and
[1:08:33] that's what we've been talking about our
[1:08:35] Series has been for the last little
[1:08:36] while amen we're talking about the
[1:08:39] attributes of God we know that God dwelt
[1:08:41] alone at one time and he didn't want to
[1:08:43] be alone ain't that right and he had
[1:08:45] attributes amen it's what he was amen
[1:08:49] and it's for that that we praise Him
[1:08:51] amen and everything that there
[1:08:53] is everything that there is is he is
[1:08:56] worthy of of Praise amen so we want to
[1:08:59] look at that again this morning with a
[1:09:00] little a little while and I thought my
[1:09:03] if I just take all of these I think
[1:09:04] there's about seven or eight of them
[1:09:06] seven different things that the Bible
[1:09:08] talks giving him honor and glory and and
[1:09:12] thanks and wisdom and strength and power
[1:09:15] and all those things you know and I
[1:09:17] thought I've got about 20 messages here
[1:09:19] so I thought well I'm going to tease
[1:09:21] them I'm going to tell them we're going
[1:09:22] to have two weeks straight services
[1:09:25] I was teasing but anyway I saidise maybe
[1:09:29] someday we will say hey let's just have
[1:09:30] a week at least you know let's have
[1:09:32] church every night maybe amen we'll just
[1:09:35] follow the leading of the spirit on it
[1:09:37] amen but amen so amen it's always good
[1:09:40] to get together amen and open the word
[1:09:42] of God Amen so if you will let's just
[1:09:45] bow our before we open the Bible we'll
[1:09:48] approach the author father once again

[1:11:05] many different things that we want to
[1:11:08] try to cover here this morning but
[1:11:10] basically the main thing that we want to
[1:11:12] talk about is the power of God Amen is
[1:11:16] that all right amen I called it uh I
[1:11:19] don't know if he's got it up there but
[1:11:21] uh think the power and strength of
[1:11:22] almighty God God's power and his his
[1:11:26] strength Revelations we'll go to
[1:11:29] Revelations I
[1:11:32] guess
[1:11:38] amen Revelations 5 actually let's go to
[1:11:42] Revelations 4 and you all forgive me but
[1:11:46] um we're going to read some of the
[1:11:47] scriptures we read before is that okay
[1:11:50] amen CU you know it reminded me of
[1:11:51] brother bham how that one woman wrote
[1:11:53] him a letter and said you know are you
[1:11:54] ever going to get job off the as sheep
[1:11:57] you know he said he was about one place
[1:11:59] he said six months but he's another
[1:12:01] place he said six weeks so he was on it
[1:12:03] for a long time amen and he says well
[1:12:05] you know as long as the Lord leads us to
[1:12:07] going that way we will you know and when
[1:12:08] he's done with it we'll we'll be done
[1:12:11] then he also talks about a preacher
[1:12:12] evangelist that went in a certain city
[1:12:15] amen he kept preaching on repentance for
[1:12:17] about five nights straight and the
[1:12:19] deacons come up and said man haven't you
[1:12:21] got something else to preach on besides
[1:12:24] repentance he says well let everybody
[1:12:26] repent and then we'll preach on
[1:12:29] else amen my my so we just want to
[1:12:33] follow the leading of the spirit is that
[1:12:35] all right Revelations 4 and verse 7 and
[1:12:39] the first Beast was like unto a lion and
[1:12:42] the second beast like unto a calf and
[1:12:44] the third Beast like the face of a man
[1:12:46] and the fourth Beast was like a flying
[1:12:48] eagle and the four beasts had each of
[1:12:50] them six wings about them and they were
[1:12:52] full of eyes within and they rest not
[1:12:54] day nor night saying holy holy holy Lord
[1:12:58] God Almighty which was which is which is
[1:13:00] to
[1:13:01] come Le give glory and honor and thanks
[1:13:04] to him that sat on the throne I like

[1:13:18] sat on the throne and worshiped him that
[1:13:20] liveth forever and forever and cast
[1:13:22] their crowns Before the Throne and I
[1:13:25] don't know just how that'll be but from
[1:13:27] what I understand Paul said that God has
[1:13:29] given him a crown of life amen so if
[1:13:33] you're actually living if you're
[1:13:34] actually given a literal crown or I
[1:13:36] don't know but they did take their
[1:13:39] crowns and they threw it at his feet and
[1:13:42] said Thou Art Worthy because without you
[1:13:44] we wouldn't have these amen how many
[1:13:46] know without Christ you would never have
[1:13:48] eternal life you wouldn't have the life

[1:19:44] you know brother brandom your story was
[1:19:46] all good until you talked about a horse

[1:19:55] says well I appreciate your criticism

[1:21:00] people in the Olympics where they get
[1:21:02] might get four or five
[1:21:05] goals maybe it's a 50 meter sprint maybe
[1:21:08] it's a marathon maybe it's 100 meter
[1:21:10] sprint amen it has all these Golds and

[1:21:23] them all
[1:21:25] he has many crowns not just one but he's
[1:21:28] a champion of many
[1:21:31] areas amen I love to talk about those
[1:21:34] areas and what he really
[1:21:38] is amen praise the
[1:21:43] Lord many crowns and he had a name
[1:21:46] written that no man knew but he himself
[1:21:50] and he was clothed with a vesture dipped

[1:22:57] own righteousness but it's his
[1:22:59] righteousness amen how many has not your

[1:23:11] everybody
[1:23:12] else oh they ain't this and they ain't

[1:24:03] huh talk about cruel wrath and he ha on
[1:24:09] his vesture and on his thigh a name
[1:24:12] written and I want it to read all the
[1:24:14] down to here to get you to get this he
[1:24:17] says a name written
[1:24:20] King of
[1:24:22] Kings he's the Lord Lord of lords I mean
[1:24:26] know over in England there's a king amen
[1:24:29] there's many lords or I guess they used
[1:24:31] to have Lord this one and Lord that one
[1:24:34] but how many knows that he is the Lord
[1:24:36] of all Lords he is the king of all
[1:24:40] Kings he is above
[1:24:42] all he's the Jesus greatest highest I
[1:24:47] will come today I am resolved no longer
[1:24:51] to linger Charmed by the world's
[1:24:53] Delights
[1:24:55] amen Jes the highest Jesus is the
[1:24:58] greatest he's the king of all Kings he's
[1:25:02] Lord of all
[1:25:04] Lords he's God of all
[1:25:11] gods amen how many beli that he's the
[1:25:14] god of
[1:25:16] gods
[1:25:17] amen for great is the Lord 1
[1:25:22] chronicles 16 ver verse 24 is declare
[1:25:25] his glory among the Heathen his Marvel
[1:25:28] Works amongst the Nations for great is
[1:25:30] the Lord and greatly to be praised he
[1:25:34] also is to fear to be feared Above All
[1:25:39] Gods Not only feared but how many beli
[1:25:41] he is to be honored Above All
[1:25:47] Gods I say it this way above it and then
[1:25:49] he says in the next verse all your gods
[1:25:51] are they can't speak they can't do
[1:25:54] nothing nothing I'm The Only God that
[1:25:56] there really is every other God's a
[1:25:59] false
[1:26:00] god amen they can't help you anything
[1:26:04] you put before God and amen eventually
[1:26:07] all can help you but God is the only
[1:26:10] living God he can help you amen he's a
[1:26:14] I'm I'm just glad to have a living God
[1:26:17] God praise be to God Amen God is good
[1:26:28] amen uh it's letting loose it's a little
[1:26:31] bit in there yet but it's letting loose
[1:26:32] I thank the Lord for it amen that God is
[1:26:35] healing me all right so
[1:26:39] now I wanted to look at something with
[1:26:41] the help of the Lord
[1:26:43] because we find that whether it's
[1:26:47] Paul or or whoever it
[1:26:51] is you know they always begin
[1:26:55] to speak about God when they begin to
[1:26:57] preach the gospel and so forth amen and
[1:27:00] they begin to get their eyes focused on
[1:27:03] the god creation
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:10] so because he is the truly the god of
[1:27:13] creation isn't he over in Colossians I
[1:27:17] think we'll start because there's
[1:27:18] several different scriptures but I want
[1:27:19] to go Colossians I believe it is
[1:27:29] yep Colossians
[1:27:37] Colossians Colossians says it this way
[1:27:40] chapter 1 verse 13 who ha delivered us
[1:27:43] from the power of darkness and has
[1:27:45] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:27:47] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[1:27:49] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[1:27:51] of sins who is the image of the inv
[1:27:54] visible God the firstborn of every
[1:27:56] creature for by him were all things
[1:28:00] created that right that are in
[1:28:04] heaven and that are in Earth visible and
[1:28:11] invisible amen whether there be
[1:28:15] Thrones or
[1:28:17] dominions or
[1:28:20] principalities or
[1:28:22] Powers how many believe that he is above
[1:28:25] every
[1:28:26] principality above every Power that is
[1:28:29] out there God is above it
[1:28:33] all all things were created by Him and
[1:28:38] for him over Revelation it says he made
[1:28:41] them all for his pleasure and for thy
[1:28:43] pleasure they are and were
[1:28:47] created amen he is before all things and
[1:28:52] by all things and by him all things
[1:28:56] consist well I'd like to use the word
[1:28:59] exist
[1:29:01] amen let's take a look this morning
[1:29:03] we're going to take a look you could
[1:29:05] very well want to look at the power of
[1:29:07] God right we want to look at look at
[1:29:11] look take a look at him amen when I
[1:29:13] thought about taking a look at him I
[1:29:15] remember what brother brandham said
[1:29:17] about the eagle story and as the eagle
[1:29:18] steareth her nest y'all remember that
[1:29:20] story and Eagles have come up to a
[1:29:23] certain age and they'll get feathers on
[1:29:25] them and everything and they're almost
[1:29:28] fly is that right and he says that great
[1:29:32] Mama there and and get in front of them
[1:29:35] sit on they'll be in the Clift of the
[1:29:37] rock Ain that right they'll be up there
[1:29:39] all safe and all they've been all tucked
[1:29:41] in and all comfy and cozy but there she
[1:29:44] comes and there she comes and just sits
[1:29:46] right there right in front of them and
[1:29:48] begin to wave them with a't that right
[1:29:52] amen and tell them I love look this is
[1:29:54] this is your mama look how great your
[1:29:56] mama is how she can
[1:29:58] fly and that's what we do amen let me
[1:30:01] tell you something we aren't talking
[1:30:02] about no literal ego we're talking about
[1:30:05] this Bible here CU brother Bram said his
[1:30:07] right those wings are the Old Testament
[1:30:10] they're the New Testament the god of the
[1:30:12] Old Testament is the god of the New
[1:30:14] Testament how many believes that amen
[1:30:17] look and how powerful God is get your
[1:30:22] confidence in God Paul said that come to
[1:30:24] you amen with enticing words of man's
[1:30:27] Wisdom but I come to you in the power
[1:30:30] and the demonstration of the spirit that
[1:30:32] your faith would not rest in enticing
[1:30:34] words of men but that it would rest in
[1:30:37] the power of God how many de Moos this
[1:30:39] morning that's what we rest in that's
[1:30:41] what we rejoice in that's what we live
[1:30:44] in is the power of almighty
[1:30:49] God woo Glory how many glad
[1:30:54] his power is not external his power is
[1:30:58] not
[1:30:59] internal it is in the combustion chamber
[1:31:02] of our
[1:31:04] heart that's where it
[1:31:08] is amen praise be to
[1:31:15] God Amen praise the
[1:31:18] Lord oh I like that don't
[1:31:21] you amen whether they be thrown Powers
[1:31:24] they were all things created for him and
[1:31:26] by him and we look at oh my that's why I
[1:31:29] love to hear the stories why because
[1:31:32] what does where does your power come
[1:31:34] from where your faith amen where does
[1:31:37] faith come from hearing the word of God
[1:31:41] that's why it never gets old whether

[1:43:19] amen Lord help us
[1:43:26] amen all right praise the Lord so where
[1:43:29] were we right let's go to another
[1:43:34] one so we see here in Colossians
[1:43:38] 1:16 amen that he created
[1:43:42] everything going never made it there all
[1:43:44] right thank you Jesus foring me of that
[1:43:48] amen you know I've learned in my life
[1:43:53] now so many times for reminding me of
[1:43:56] stuff I'd have totally forgot if he
[1:43:58] wouldn't have reminded I I rely on God
[1:44:00] to remind me of things don't you amen I
[1:44:03] I count him as my guide he's my guide is
[1:44:08] that right and so sometimes I forget
[1:44:10] stuff and don't remember and I says Lord
[1:44:11] you must purpose or the reason for me
[1:44:13] forgetting that I don't know but you
[1:44:16] know amen but my scripture Psalms
[1:44:19] 121 yall remember you don't have to go
[1:44:22] to it I'll read it right quick I will
[1:44:24] lift mine eyes unto the hills from
[1:44:27] whence cometh my
[1:44:29] help heyen you know and if you just took
[1:44:33] that scripture it would look like you're
[1:44:36] looking to them
[1:44:38] Hills is that right now how many know
[1:44:41] ain't no can of bucket or or faith in a
[1:44:44] in a a bucket or you got to have your
[1:44:47] faith in the right thing brother Ram
[1:44:48] says not some post or some tree or some
[1:44:52] Hill
[1:44:53] huh but remember the one man brother B
[1:44:56] talked about how that he was an atheist
[1:44:58] all his life went out on a vacation I'm
[1:45:00] not sure if he was sick or not and dying
[1:45:02] or what but he went he went and and he
[1:45:04] was walking along these rocks and he be
[1:45:07] to look at these
[1:45:08] rocks and the man got saved looking at
[1:45:12] rocks if I understand brother Brandon
[1:45:15] right ain't that right because he says
[1:45:17] you had to come from
[1:45:19] somewhere man there has to be a creator
[1:45:22] that made you and when you begin to
[1:45:25] believe there is
[1:45:26] a you're on the
[1:45:29] road see the next verse says amen and my
[1:45:32] Help Cometh From The Lord which made
[1:45:35] Heaven and Earth how many believe that's
[1:45:38] where our help that's where our strength
[1:45:40] come from and that made
[1:45:42] everything that's where your strength
[1:45:44] come that's where the come
[1:45:47] from it's the one that made it
[1:45:51] all he
[1:45:56] amen all right let me just
[1:45:58] go amen the one that
[1:46:05] coulds the
[1:46:06] moon the
[1:46:08] sun look look at what he
[1:46:13] done now I begin to think
[1:46:15] about how much
[1:46:18] power the kind of
[1:46:20] power that it would take to create
[1:46:22] create something like that we know that
[1:46:24] man has gotten famous for the things
[1:46:27] that they create things they build even
[1:46:29] the pyramids brother bam said that they
[1:46:31] don't know how they did it they don't
[1:46:33] have that kind of power to do it
[1:46:35] nowadays they had a power that we didn't
[1:46:38] know about to build those pyramids how
[1:46:41] great those pyramids I guess are be nice
[1:46:43] to see them sometime perhaps just to be
[1:46:45] in awe ain't that right of the pyramids
[1:46:48] and so forth that heat they
[1:46:51] made but then you think
[1:46:55] about you think about each star that's
[1:46:58] out
[1:47:00] there each Galaxy that's out
[1:47:05] there Amen brother Glenn and sister
[1:47:07] Sherry what was your David David your
[1:47:12] nephew yeah Reeves he has the what do
[1:47:16] you call
[1:47:18] that yeah but anyway they they look at
[1:47:21] the galaxies and study and stars and
[1:47:23] everything like that and and and there
[1:47:26] was a certain area not so long ago told
[1:47:28] me about that there was all these godet
[1:47:29] they thought they had it all figured out
[1:47:31] but they look between these little Glo
[1:47:32] of stars a little bit in between and
[1:47:34] they really focused out on that and they
[1:47:36] look way out through there and they
[1:47:38] found more galaxies between the stars
[1:47:41] and they say that there's more stars
[1:47:43] than there is sand upon the Earth is
[1:47:46] that right more stars out there God spun
[1:47:50] them out there spun them out there spun
[1:47:52] them out out there hung the moon hung
[1:47:55] the
[1:47:58] stars now let me stop there and think
[1:48:01] about you business people you business
[1:48:04] people that run your business and how
[1:48:07] busy it gets right this worker that
[1:48:09] worker there's someone here he has a
[1:48:11] flat tire this one here you got to keep
[1:48:12] it all working Marth and N know they run
[1:48:15] a big business get up at 3:00 I
[1:48:17] understand a lot of times in the morning
[1:48:18] to try to make all of this run right
[1:48:20] hopefully all the workers working this
[1:48:22] add the other the labor that it is the
[1:48:25] strain and the things that'll go into it
[1:48:27] ain't that right it takes a
[1:48:31] lot there you go amen that's right it
[1:48:33] takes a lot to do all of that can you
[1:48:35] imagine God hanging all of those out
[1:48:38] there isin that right Heaven the Sun the
[1:48:40] moon the star the Earth all of those
[1:48:43] things and then he has to keep them
[1:48:46] running
[1:48:49] perfectly all of them has to stay in
[1:48:51] their places
[1:48:53] the Earth the Sun the moon everything
[1:48:55] has to rotate perfectly imagine the
[1:48:58] power that it takes for that all to
[1:49:02] happen I can say without a doubt that
[1:49:05] it's beyond our
[1:49:08] comprehension it's beyond our
[1:49:10] comprehension and then to think amen
[1:49:12] that each individual that he sits at the
[1:49:14] right hand of God Amen today making
[1:49:17] intercessions for every saint all over
[1:49:19] the world not only that but answering
[1:49:22] their prayers
[1:49:23] that takes a lot of
[1:49:27] power it takes a lot of power our God is
[1:49:29] an awesome God He rigns from heaven
[1:49:33] above with wisdom power and love our God
[1:49:35] is an awesome
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:40] God
[1:49:43] power
[1:49:47] amen
[1:49:50] amen my wife don't mind
[1:49:53] but she said you know why can't I be
[1:49:55] like that woman that brother Brandon Met
[1:49:56] there at that little 10- cent store she
[1:49:59] was 60 years old I guess looked about 30
[1:50:02] that right and she he said you know what
[1:50:04] is the secret do you not having be old
[1:50:06] wrinkled and all this other stuff she
[1:50:08] says brother brand I'll tell you what
[1:50:10] when I was younger I got
[1:50:12] saved I got saved and any time that I
[1:50:15] have a problem I just hand it to God if
[1:50:18] it's too big for him I sure don't need
[1:50:20] to try to deal with him amen so she
[1:50:23] learned to lean on God let God fight
[1:50:26] your
[1:50:27] battles give your case to the Lord Jesus
[1:50:30] Christ he's an awesome
[1:50:32] attorney he'll fight for you just give
[1:50:35] it to him learn to surrender to him
[1:50:38] he'll take care of your
[1:50:40] [Applause]
[1:50:42] problem amen he's a big God he's not too
[1:50:46] big for him how many believes he's a
[1:50:49] specialist our God is a specialist
[1:50:54] amen I love
[1:51:00] that
[1:51:02] amen I meant to bring it I don't guess I
[1:51:04] did so I'll just say it it's kind of
[1:51:06] like this preacher was down in Florida
[1:51:11] and his GMC vehicle broke down he was in
[1:51:14] the shop the mechanic was in there just
[1:51:17] trying to figure out what in the world
[1:51:20] wrong with this couldn't figure out what
[1:51:23] and there was a well-dressed man come
[1:51:25] over there amen and he says here let me
[1:51:28] take a look at that and he looked at it
[1:51:30] a little bit here and he moved this one
[1:51:32] this wire this whatever he moved it
[1:51:34] around a little bit and he say now try
[1:51:35] it then went in the guy went in there
[1:51:37] and cranked it
[1:51:39] up and then after a bit they come over
[1:51:42] and he says say just tell me who are you
[1:51:44] anyway he says chief engineer of of of
[1:51:48] and I oh my think about it he was the
[1:51:51] chief engineer he knew how to do it and
[1:51:54] brother bam says we've got a chief
[1:51:55] engineer he's well dressed in the
[1:51:58] righteousness of almighty God he knows
[1:52:01] how to take care of

[2:08:55] Schwarzenegger is that right a great big
[2:09:00] man we know his name because of how
[2:09:03] great he was in strength and muscles
[2:09:05] is't that right we know Mike Tyson for

[2:09:10] uppercut right hand or something like
[2:09:12] it's either his right hand or left I
[2:09:13] don't know but it was one of them that
[2:09:15] was deadly dangers is't that right amen
[2:09:17] remember Mike Tyson we name remember

[2:09:36] amen and I'll tell you who's the true
[2:09:39] Hercules I'll tell you who's the Str
[2:09:41] strong man when Christ was going up the
[2:09:43] calvary amen bearing the cross he was
[2:09:46] holding the weight of the world on his
[2:09:49] shoulders but he made it all the
[2:09:52] way a't that right and he went and
[2:09:55] conquered death hell and the grave he
[2:09:58] has the mighty
[2:10:00] conqueror he's the champion of the
[2:10:06] world he is the champion he has the
[2:10:10] crown for being the strongest man ever
[2:10:23] that's right strongest man
[2:10:27] ever was Jesus he truly had the waited
[2:10:31] the world on his
[2:10:35] shoulders did it he carried it all of
[2:10:39] our
[2:10:40] sins all of the whole world's
[2:10:43] sins
[2:10:45] failure and sin of every person that
[2:10:48] ever committed a sin
[2:10:51] that cross would have been good for
[2:10:54] Cain his
[2:10:56] sins it would have been good if Cain
[2:10:59] would have
[2:11:00] accepted all those who the benefit of it
[2:11:03] until he paid the price is't that right
[2:11:07] but when they accept that the
[2:11:08] sacrificial lamb or the uh
[2:11:12] the sacrificial lamb substitute
[2:11:15] substitutional lamb down through the
[2:11:17] dark dark ages Old
[2:11:20] Testament they accepted that that was
[2:11:23] May meaning they were believing that the
[2:11:25] lamb was going to come and God held them
[2:11:28] there until the real lamb came when it
[2:11:31] came amen it says that that place opened
[2:11:33] up and they went to Paradise is that
[2:11:36] right they come up and they got the
[2:11:38] benefits of it Cain could have but he
[2:11:40] didn't accept it di Jesus died for the
[2:11:43] sins of the whole world from the
[2:11:44] beginning to the end if they would just
[2:11:47] accept it
[2:11:49] amen praise the Lord he was the true one
[2:11:53] that is his name is above every
[2:11:57] name that is
[2:12:00] named see which he wrought in Christ
[2:12:03] when he raised him from the dead and at
[2:12:06] his own right hand in Heavenly places
[2:12:10] far above I like that far above all
[2:12:16] principalities and
