[0:01] But I happen to believe that until we
[0:03] take our last breath, until the rapture
[0:05] takes place, Amen, the real church of
[0:07] God is going to be getting closer and
[0:09] closer and closer to him.
[0:13] Every human being has this certain
[0:15] amount of draw in him. Isn't that right?
[0:17] Cuz brother said God had put those
[0:19] thirst in every soul. Africa. No matter
[0:23] where you go, go out there where they
[0:25] never had no civilization. They'll be
[0:27] worshiping something.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they have a thirst. They
[0:33] have something in their hearts to tell
[0:34] them they come from somewhere. Something
[0:37] made me.
[0:39] Amen.
[0:42] And even if you don't come to God, even
[0:46] Jesus says uh come unto me all ye who
[0:49] are weary in heaven laid laden.
[0:51] Revelations the last chapter says the
[0:52] spirit and the bride say come.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Everybody's saying come come unto me
[0:58] come to God come come. Drawing pulling.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08] And
[1:10] you can be like the critics, the
[1:14] unbeliever,
[1:15] because he says there's always people
[1:16] that want to make fun,
[1:21] come to criticize.
[1:24] But guess what? The Bible says that if
[1:26] you're in the depths of the sea or if
[1:28] you're in death or if you're in hell,
[1:31] when he calls, you'll answer. I mean,
[1:34] come to him one of these days. You'll be
[1:37] drawn to him one day.
[1:40] Let's hope that it is before judgment
[1:42] day
[1:44] &gt;&gt; cuz every knee shall bow, every tongue
[1:45] shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[1:48] So I'm thankful this morning. Brother
[1:51] Bandam, he says it this way. One day I
[1:53] was talking to the wife, one of the
[1:55] first meetings that we ever had, and she
[1:57] says, "All those people come." He says,
[2:00] "And I said, the gospel is the greatest
[2:03] drawing card the world has ever had."
[2:08] Amen. If I be lifted up, I'll draw all
[2:10] men unto myself again. And he says, "And
[2:13] I certainly am grateful to God for what
[2:16] he's doing in these last days." how that
[2:18] he's drawing men from everywhere to
[2:19] serve him and made his great drawing
[2:22] power. It's the greatest drawing power
[2:25] the world has ever known. Again, he says
[2:27] because Jesus said, "If I be lifted up,
[2:30] I will draw all men unto myself." How
[2:32] many knows down through the age, it has
[2:35] been the greatest drawing power
[2:38] for 2,000 years,
[2:41] especially think about in our generation
[2:43] in the 40s, the 30s. Amen. During this
[2:46] revival, this end time revival we had,
[2:50] you'd never hear of a half a million
[2:52] people gathering together,
[2:55] truckloads upon truckloads of CS and
[2:58] stretchers and people shutting the whole
[3:00] city down. Would to God Elton would get
[3:03] shut down, brother. Shut down, brother
[3:05] Tom. Because if everybody Amen. walking
[3:07] the streets praising God, singing only
[3:10] believe, only believe, all things are
[3:12] possible.
[3:15] It's a drawing power. How many believes
[3:17] it's the greatest drawing power there
[3:20] ever was? Why? Because it's the greatest
[3:22] thing that there ever was.
