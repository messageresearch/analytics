[43:29] without a ray of cheer
[43:33] and

[43:40] For the midst of sin may rise
[43:44] and hide the starry skies,

[44:29] eyes be filled with tears,
[44:33] but Jesus is a friend who watches day
[44:36] and night.
[44:39] Will I go to him in prayer? For he knows

[46:11] family in and we went to the meetings
[46:13] the other day and brother Gary Hair, a
[46:15] lot of you know him and and if you ever
[46:18] watch any of DV any of the messages from
[46:20] Brother Donny's church, he's the
[46:22] gray-haired gentleman that plays the
[46:24] steel guitar. I've known Brother Gary my
[46:26] whole life and they lived upstairs from
[46:28] us. And I as I was brother Gary was
[46:31] talking to me about my dad and he said I
[46:33] want to tell you something about your
[46:34] dad and I said what he said we was at
[46:39] church that night and brother Smith was
[46:40] our pastor and he said
[46:43] brother Smith come out of the pastor
[46:45] study because back then we had phones we
[46:47] didn't even know what a cell phone was
[46:49] then but and brother Smith come in front
[46:52] of the church and he said church he said
[46:55] brother Wade is fixing to go unless God
[46:58] moves on the scene. He said, "They've
[47:00] called the family in, they'd give him
[47:02] five minutes to live."
[47:04] And my dad was bleeding so bad out his
[47:07] nose, all the blood they'd put in, it
[47:08] would just gush out. They and he was in
[47:11] the best hospital in Chicago there was.
[47:14] And so he said, "Brother David, we all
[47:16] got down up front." And he said, "We
[47:19] prayed."
[47:21] &gt;&gt; And he said, you know,
[47:24] he said, "Brother Smith went back after
[47:26] we got done praying." And he said a few
[47:27] minutes later he come back out. He said,
[47:29] "I just want to tell you."
[47:32] He said, "His blood has changed pink and
[47:35] he's quit bleeding."
[47:38] And he said, "Brother David, that was
[47:39] the first miracle I had ever seen in a
[47:42] time like that." And I said, "God is
[47:46] good." He said, "Oh, yeah. He's very
[47:47] good." And and my dad was always a real
[47:50] prayer warrior. And you know, I said,
[47:54] and I know no matter what we go through,
[47:56] God's a healer tonight
[47:58] &gt;&gt; and he's a savior. And somebody, of
[48:02] course, I said a seen a lot of those
[48:03] people that I knew and they all said the
[48:05] same thing. They never a lot of them
[48:07] didn't have much hope that I'd ever make
[48:09] it, but there was a God that had
[48:10] different ideas. Aren't you glad for
[48:12] that God tonight? Amen. Sister
[48:14] Annabelle, do you have a special
[48:16] tonight? Come ahead.

[53:24] Lord.

[54:11] Lord.
[54:14] Come and quench,
[54:18] thirsty

[54:36] more.
[54:38] Here's my cup.

[54:44] make me whole.
[54:48] Amen. It's the only thing that's going
[54:50] to make us whole. You, friend, is a Holy
[54:53] Spirit in our lives. It gives us a
[54:55] purpose. It gives a reason. It's why we
[54:57] come here tonight. It's It's all Jesus.
[54:59] It's all It's all that we need.
[55:02] Everything else taken care of. Let's
[55:04] pray. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful we
[55:06] can come gather tonight with believers.
[55:09] And father, it's just such a such a
[55:11] privilege that we can we can have things
[55:14] in common. And not just we can gather a
[55:16] lot of people have things in common, but
[55:18] when it's you, Father, when it's Christ
[55:20] that we have in common, that's that's
[55:22] the difference maker. And we we see you
[55:24] in different people's lives. And it just
[55:26] gives us courage. We see that the word
[55:28] is having the effect it's supposed to
[55:29] have. We see it in our our lives. We see
[55:32] it around us. And then we look out at
[55:34] the world and see how dark it is. is.
[55:35] And no matter how dark it is, the light
[55:37] shines just as bright as it is dark. And
[55:40] so, Father, tonight we want to get a
[55:42] closer look at the light. We want to see
[55:44] what you are doing. We want to
[55:45] recognize, Father, the word having the
[55:47] effect in each life, Father, and we want
[55:50] to accept it more and believe it. And,
[55:51] Father, just to lay aside all our doubt
[55:53] and unbelief and just receive what you
[55:56] have for us tonight. Won't you speak to
[55:57] each heart, Lord? Let each person know
[55:59] that they heard your voice tonight.
[56:01] Lord, I ask this, Lord, in your name.
[56:03] Amen.
[56:05] I'm going to read out of Revelations 13
[56:08] verse 11-14 just to get started here.
[56:12] It's sure good to be back here in Elton.
[56:14] I just you guys are just a wonderful
[56:16] group here. It's always such a great
[56:18] atmosphere and I just appreciate that so
[56:20] much.
[56:22] Just good people.
[56:30] Something happened to my pad and it's
[56:32] got the wrong thing written down. I
[56:34] better read out of a Bible. I guess
[56:36] that's okay to still do the oldfashioned
[56:38] way, huh?
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Verse 11, chapter 13-11. I beheld
[56:44] another beast coming up out of the
[56:45] earth. He had two horns like a lamb. He
[56:47] spake as a dragon.
[56:50] He exercisth all the power of the first
[56:52] beast before him, and causes the earth,
[56:54] and them which dwell therein to worship
[56:56] the first beast, whose deadly wound was
[56:58] healed. And this is what I want to get
[57:00] to. He doeth great wonders so that he
[57:03] maketh fire come down from heaven on the
[57:05] earth in the sight of men. He deceiveth
[57:08] them that dwell on the earth by the
[57:09] means of those miracles which he had
[57:11] power to do in the sight of the beast.
[57:14] Let me repeat that. He deceiveth them
[57:16] that dwell on the earth by the means of
[57:19] those miracles
[57:20] which he had power to do in the sight of
[57:22] the beast. saying to them that dwell on
[57:24] the earth that they should make an image
[57:26] to the beast which had the wound by a
[57:28] sword and did live. You may be seated
[57:30] this evening.
[57:35] Tonight I want to speak on the thought
[57:36] of a simple evidence and I want to ask
[57:39] the question can you allow God to be
[57:42] simple in your life. We know brother
[57:44] Brandon preached on that. He preached
[57:45] some a great message. God hides himself
[57:47] in simplicity. He reveals himself in
[57:50] simplicity. And if God does this, then
[57:53] we know Satan's doing all he can to make
[57:56] God anything but simple.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; He anything. And there's so many ways he
[58:01] goes about it. This is how he got Eve to
[58:03] fall. This is how he gets every one of
[58:05] us to make mistakes, to do the things.
[58:07] He's got every church to to go off on
[58:10] their tangents the way they have by
[58:11] making God anything but simple because
[58:14] simple is not pleasing to our old
[58:16] nature. We want to have something we can
[58:18] do in it. We want to have something we
[58:19] can brag about. We want to have
[58:21] something like to to be beautiful. You
[58:23] know what what what what what the church
[58:24] did is she wanted to be more beautiful.
[58:26] She wanted to be more pre more more
[58:28] prestige. She wanted more whatever it is
[58:30] that that get that attracts people to
[58:33] her. And that's why say that's what
[58:35] Satan does because the simple gospel is
[58:38] just plain and simple and that's just
[58:40] all there is. And it doesn't give us any
[58:42] any room to to exalt ourselves and like
[58:45] well look at me. Look how holy I'm
[58:47] living. Look what's going on in my life.
[58:49] Look at all this. And that's what Satan
[58:50] wants to do is get us f focusing on an
[58:53] evidence that is not based on the simple
[58:56] fulfilling of the word.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; There's always got to be something else.
[59:01] He wants to add something else so that
[59:02] well I know God did this because this
[59:05] but was it just the simple word that you
[59:07] were basing your evidence on or do you
[59:09] need some kind of fantastic something
[59:10] else to base your evidence? What is your
[59:13] evidence? And that not I'm not just
[59:15] talking evidence of being born again,
[59:16] but anything that you base your faith
[59:18] on, there's got to be an evidence that
[59:19] you base your faith on. And if it's not
[59:21] simple, you're missing out on God.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to read out of I want to
[59:26] read out of First Kings 19. I'm going to
[59:29] read 11 through13. And you all know this
[59:31] is where Elijah was called up on the
[59:32] mountain.
[59:34] And God said and God said, he said, "Go
[59:37] forth and stand up on the mount before
[59:39] the Lord." So, right away we're going to
[59:40] look. He said, "Go stand before me." He
[59:43] is there where God called him be. In
[59:44] other words, he said, "Go to that
[59:46] church.
[59:48] This is the church I want you to go to.
[59:50] This is where you're supposed to be, and
[59:52] I'm going to deal with you there."
[59:55] &gt;&gt; And behold, the Lord passed by. Now,
[59:58] listen. The Lord passed by. He told him
[1:00:00] to go there, and the Lord came by where
[1:00:02] he was.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; And a great and strong wind the
[1:00:08] mountains and break in pieces the rocks
[1:00:10] before the Lord. Now, if you went to
[1:00:13] church and you saw something like that
[1:00:15] happen, what would your what would your
[1:00:17] result be? What would your uh
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; what would your evidence be?
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; How would you respond to that? I'd have
[1:00:27] a shouting, running hissy fit.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Look what God is doing.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; He called me to this church. He put me
[1:00:34] here and he passed by. The very presence
[1:00:37] of the Lord passed by and look what he
[1:00:39] did. And that's what happens. And the
[1:00:41] the anointing comes. It's the presence
[1:00:43] of the Lord.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; But wait, you know what this says?
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; The Lord was not in the wind.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; You told me to come here. Okay, let's
[1:00:59] look. Here's Elijah. He's standing
[1:01:01] there. I I know. Imagine this. He's
[1:01:03] standing there on this mountain and God
[1:01:06] said, "Come here." And a mighty wind
[1:01:07] comes by so strong it breaks rocks. Have
[1:01:10] you ever seen a wind that strong?
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; I haven't.
[1:01:14] Wow. What a supernatural thing is
[1:01:17] happen. What a phen. This is amazing. I
[1:01:19] got to tell somebody.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; But the Lord wasn't in the wind.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; And after the wind and earthquake.
[1:01:31] So the first of all the wind comes and
[1:01:32] blows and knocks rocks over and breaking
[1:01:34] them. And the Lord, so Elijah, he just
[1:01:36] standing there.
[1:01:38] Nope, that ain't it.
[1:01:41] God brought me here, but that wasn't it.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; So what is it? Oh, earthquake. Shaking
[1:01:47] everything. Probably fell down and he
[1:01:48] was like grabbing rocks and he's looking
[1:01:50] around. He stands back up. He said,
[1:01:53] "Nope.
[1:01:54] God wasn't into earthquake."
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; After the earthquake of fire, that would
[1:02:00] have got me. I mean, if with that
[1:02:03] because I mean, here's a fire. The fire
[1:02:05] of God comes down and just scorches
[1:02:07] everything around.
[1:02:09] You know, Elijah's standing in the midst
[1:02:10] of that fire. He's looking around. He
[1:02:12] says, "No,
[1:02:15] this ain't it. God's not in the fire.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Look at the phenomena going on.
[1:02:24] Look how we would have responded to that
[1:02:26] kind of of supernatural activity.
[1:02:30] After
[1:02:33] the fire, after the fire, a still small
[1:02:38] voice.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; And it was so when Elijah heard it that
[1:02:43] he wrapped his face in his mantle and
[1:02:46] went out and stood in the entry of the
[1:02:49] cave. And behold, there came a voice
[1:02:51] into him and said, "What you doing,
[1:02:53] Elijah?
[1:02:55] Wait a minute. All this mighty stuff
[1:02:58] going on." And then all God says very
[1:03:00] very quietly said, "What are you doing
[1:03:02] here? Why are you in church?
[1:03:05] Why did you come here tonight? Did you
[1:03:08] want to see some fantastics?"
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; I love fantastics.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; I love the the move of the spirit. We
[1:03:15] have to have it.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; But you can have all this stuff that
[1:03:19] Elijah saw and God wasn't in it.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He's testing the
[1:03:24] prophet. Are you going to run? Are you
[1:03:26] going to run with these phenomena? Are
[1:03:27] you going to run with all these
[1:03:28] supernatural things? Are you going to
[1:03:29] run with all the gifts? Are you going to
[1:03:31] run with all this stuff that that's this
[1:03:32] great that that that humans would call
[1:03:35] wonderful and great? Or are you going to
[1:03:37] wait for the voice?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Because the reality is, friends,
[1:03:46] God is the word and the word always has
[1:03:49] a voice.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And that's where your evidence is.
[1:03:52] That's because you heard the voice of
[1:03:54] God. He told you who he you were. He
[1:03:56] told you who he is and you believe that
[1:03:58] and that's all God ever wanted from you.
[1:04:01] It just simply believe the voice when it
[1:04:03] talks to you.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's the simplicity he hides it in.
[1:04:07] But look what he he does all this other
[1:04:09] stuff. Say are you going to chase after
[1:04:10] that? Brother Brandon preached on this.
[1:04:12] He said people go the churches are
[1:04:14] going. He said they're running. They're
[1:04:16] doing all they can but they don't have a
[1:04:18] message and you can run without a
[1:04:20] message. And oh how many people would
[1:04:22] have taken those things? I got to go
[1:04:24] tell somebody. And they were running.
[1:04:26] Look, God knocked the rocks over. He had
[1:04:28] an earthquake. He had a fire.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; But what did he say?
[1:04:34] Well, what do you mean? Don't you
[1:04:37] understand? That wind was so great it
[1:04:39] was breaking rocks.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; There was fire. The fire of God fell
[1:04:43] down. But what did he say?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You can have all these supernatural
[1:04:48] wonderful phenomena and all this. You
[1:04:50] can have healings and deliverance and
[1:04:52] raise the dead and do all those things
[1:04:54] and God not even in it
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; because God has a voice.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; If you don't hear the voice, what good
[1:05:04] is it going to do your soul?
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Because we just saw Satan can do those
[1:05:10] miracles, too. Satan can produce all
[1:05:13] that kind of stuff.
[1:05:18] His
[1:05:20] evidence was God spoke to me and then he
[1:05:25] did what did he do? He he said, "What
[1:05:26] are you doing here?" And and Elijah
[1:05:28] said, "Well, I'm doing this. I'm do
[1:05:29] this." And God corrected him. He said,
[1:05:31] "No, you're wrong. Your your idea is
[1:05:33] wrong about this. You think you're the
[1:05:34] only one left. You're not."
[1:05:37] And he set him on the path and he gave
[1:05:39] him a message. Now go do this. Go do
[1:05:41] that. And that's all he wants you to do.
[1:05:43] He says, "I want you to run. Everyone,
[1:05:44] this ain't just for preachers. This is
[1:05:46] everyone who's born again. Every one of
[1:05:48] you have a ministry and every one of you
[1:05:49] have the voice of God to speak through
[1:05:51] your life. And that might not come from
[1:05:52] your mouth, but it's going to come from
[1:05:54] your life. And it's the voice of God and
[1:05:55] it's your ministry and God, take this
[1:05:57] and run, but don't run until you go with
[1:05:59] what I give you to go with.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; How many people go out and try to
[1:06:04] accomplish something and they don't have
[1:06:06] a message to go with? You say, "I'm a
[1:06:08] message believer. I automatically have a
[1:06:09] message." No. No. And no.
[1:06:12] Just because someone says I'm a message
[1:06:14] preacher don't know doesn't mean they
[1:06:16] have a message at all because they can
[1:06:17] be preaching that's their theology that
[1:06:19] can be predicting their their theories
[1:06:23] or something like that without the voice
[1:06:25] ever speaking to them and revealing to
[1:06:26] them this is the truth of it
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; and you have you can see it I'm sure
[1:06:32] you've seen it you have you have a
[1:06:34] minister gets up he is so focused on the
[1:06:36] theology of the message and the
[1:06:38] mysteries and all this but there's no
[1:06:39] life to back it up and you have someone
[1:06:41] else and They preach and they just focus
[1:06:43] on the miracles and the signs and the
[1:06:45] supernatural, but there's no voice in
[1:06:47] what they're saying. And what are they
[1:06:49] doing? They're taking away from the
[1:06:51] simplicity that God requires of his
[1:06:53] bride.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Quit focusing on that. Quit focusing on
[1:06:57] that. We got to have it all. But in the
[1:06:59] middle, your foundation, your evidence
[1:07:00] is that God has spoke to you.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; There is the evidence. That's the
[1:07:06] revelation on which he builds his
[1:07:08] church. It's the voice of God to you
[1:07:10] personally. And you know what he said
[1:07:12] cuz you were there to hear it.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; And the the more mature you get in
[1:07:21] Christ, the closer you going to have
[1:07:24] that it it's like I hate saying this. If
[1:07:28] you're immature in Christ, you might
[1:07:30] still need the thunder and lightning for
[1:07:31] something to believe
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; because you don't have confidence in
[1:07:38] that still small voice yet. Oh,
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about. I've been
[1:07:43] there
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; and God could speak to me, but I said, I
[1:07:46] need to get prayed for now. I need
[1:07:48] something. I need to feel the move of
[1:07:50] the spirit in order for me to believe
[1:07:51] that was God speaking to me.
[1:07:55] I couldn't get simple enough. I couldn't
[1:07:57] let God be simple enough in my life just
[1:08:00] to be that voice. You know, Brother Bram
[1:08:01] said he he he likes he like it's like he
[1:08:04] takes a a man who take his wife up and
[1:08:06] whisper his love secrets to her and
[1:08:08] that's all God wants to do. He don't
[1:08:09] always want to have to sit there and
[1:08:10] holler and scream and hit you with
[1:08:12] lightnings and and whatever else. He
[1:08:14] said, "Won't you just come away with me
[1:08:15] a little bit? Let's spend time just you
[1:08:17] and me together."
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; And he wants to whisper to you. He don't
[1:08:23] have to shake and hit you on the head.
[1:08:24] Hey, I'm talking to you. What a kind of
[1:08:27] relationship is that?
[1:08:30] Come up to me. Let me talk to you. And
[1:08:32] you hear that voice and you walk out of
[1:08:34] there and your faith is grounded in that
[1:08:36] he told you that.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Do you feel anything?
[1:08:42] I felt a lot of love.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; That's what it that's what it that's
[1:08:47] what it produces, friends. And and
[1:08:49] here's here's what I just let Let me say
[1:08:51] this real quick. When you see a ministry
[1:08:54] that produces Christ,
[1:08:58] it don't care. I don't care if it
[1:08:59] produces miracles or not, signs will
[1:09:01] follow. Well, that's fine, but that's
[1:09:03] not what you're looking for anyways
[1:09:04] because you can get signs. You could
[1:09:05] have gone to Arizona a couple days ago
[1:09:07] and saw all kinds of signs and wonders
[1:09:09] out in that stadium. And you talk about
[1:09:11] anointing, there's an anointing going
[1:09:12] out there. And brothers and sister, they
[1:09:14] were saying a lot of really cool things
[1:09:16] and really nice things, but recognize
[1:09:18] that that is still the beast system
[1:09:20] coming into power.
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Don't be fooled by that, friends.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; They were I'm off my side here. Let me
[1:09:31] just real quick look. They were out
[1:09:33] there. They the the Catholics and the
[1:09:36] prot they didn't care who was Catholic,
[1:09:38] who was Protestant. We had our most
[1:09:40] powerful politicians in the world, the
[1:09:42] most powerful nation ever been, and out
[1:09:45] there preaching Jesus Christ. Can you
[1:09:47] imagine that happening?
[1:09:52] What's going on? She's taking control.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And they didn't care who was speaking,
[1:09:57] if they're Catholic or Protestant. They
[1:09:59] were together. They say they're still
[1:10:01] preaching Christ. We're going to accept
[1:10:03] it. You tell me that the the the
[1:10:05] daughters haven't gone back to mama
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; They don't care anymore. And it looks so
[1:10:10] good.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; And it comes in with flatteries. And it
[1:10:14] comes in making people think this is
[1:10:16] wonderful. And I wish it was. And
[1:10:18] there's so much that we so what? But we
[1:10:20] know it's too late. America has crossed
[1:10:22] the line. There's no more mercy. There's
[1:10:24] no coming back for America. All that's
[1:10:26] going to come back is that beast system
[1:10:28] that that the the that that Roman spirit
[1:10:31] of of of that dominating iron
[1:10:33] disposition is going to show itself and
[1:10:36] it's going to dominate the world and
[1:10:37] there's only one thing standing be
[1:10:39] between it and the domination of the
[1:10:41] world and that's you.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; You're staying square in the middle of
[1:10:46] them taking over and you think they're
[1:10:48] going to let us go without trying to
[1:10:50] shut us down. The prophet told you
[1:10:51] they're going to shut us down. Yeah.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "When they try to shut us up,
[1:10:55] God's going to take us up."
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're watching scripture being
[1:11:00] fulfilled all around us. We're
[1:11:02] absolutely watching what's right here,
[1:11:04] written how long ago, and we're watching
[1:11:06] it happen. But where would we be without
[1:11:08] the message of the hour to tell us this
[1:11:10] stuff? I tell you what, we'd be right in
[1:11:12] the middle of that.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, we should be so h We are happy. We
[1:11:17] are grateful. Look what God has done.
[1:11:19] has opened our eyes so we're not being
[1:11:22] deceived by that beast system.
[1:11:26] [Applause]
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; You know, they crucified our savior and
[1:11:35] those Roman soldiers, this is just some
[1:11:37] kind of another one of these crazy Jews,
[1:11:41] put him up on the cross, very humble.
[1:11:44] What happened?
[1:11:46] There's earthquake. Darkness covered the
[1:11:49] earth. And what did they say? Oh, this
[1:11:52] was the son of God. They recognized it
[1:11:56] after it's too late. The spiritual
[1:11:58] phenomena opened their eyes. Oh my
[1:11:59] goodness, look what we've done. After it
[1:12:02] was too late.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; After it was too late.
[1:12:08] Let me move on here. So you say, well,
[1:12:10] well, how do we how do we allow God to
[1:12:12] be simple
[1:12:15] in our lives? So we're going to read out
[1:12:18] of Mark 10 and verse 13. We must become
[1:12:22] simple ourselves.
[1:12:25] We have to also become simple.
[1:12:28] Verse 13, 10:13. And they brought young
[1:12:31] children to him that he should touch
[1:12:32] them. His disciples rebuked those that
[1:12:34] brought them. And when Jesus saw it, he
[1:12:37] was much displeased.
[1:12:39] He said, "Don't don't stop those young
[1:12:42] people, those kids from come unto me,"
[1:12:45] and said unto them, "Suffer the little
[1:12:46] children to come unto me, and forbid
[1:12:48] them not, for such is the kingdom of
[1:12:51] God. Verily I send to you, whosoever
[1:12:54] shall not receive the kingdom of God as
[1:12:55] a little child, he shall not enter
[1:12:57] therein." He took them up in his arms,
[1:12:59] put his arms around them, and blessed
[1:13:00] them. How does a child receive it? You
[1:13:02] say, "Well, how how would a child
[1:13:04] receive anything when we're supposed to
[1:13:05] receive the kingdom of God like a child?
[1:13:07] How does a child receive something?"
[1:13:10] Mommy, I'm hungry.
[1:13:13] Oh, that's too simple. You know what she
[1:13:16] responds? Well, honey, I know you're
[1:13:18] three years old, but you got to earn
[1:13:19] dinner.
[1:13:21] Have you done good enough to be fed?
[1:13:24] Have you lived a good life? Are you good
[1:13:27] enough? Do you think you earn Have you
[1:13:29] really earned dinner?
[1:13:32] Have you impressed me enough to get to
[1:13:34] feed you?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; How many how many people look at God
[1:13:38] that way?
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; How many people see the the rules of the
[1:13:43] message and say, "Oh, I got to earn his
[1:13:45] blessing."
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You see how Satan corrupts us from the
[1:13:50] simplicity?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; You know what a real three-year-old?
[1:13:55] Mommy, I'm hungry. Well, wait for
[1:13:57] dinner. Oh, mommy, I'm hungry. No.
[1:14:02] You cry out until you get what you want.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Don't ever quit. I don't have a hissy
[1:14:09] fit. I'm not talking about that.
[1:14:16] Well, why do you believe, you know,
[1:14:18] another three-year-old comes up and
[1:14:19] says, and he says, you know, my my daddy
[1:14:21] said the the the moon is made of green
[1:14:23] cheese.
[1:14:25] Well, my daddy said it's made of yellow
[1:14:27] cheese.
[1:14:29] Well, why do you believe that? Daddy
[1:14:31] said so.
[1:14:33] It's that simple. Why do you believe the
[1:14:35] crazy things that people could do? How
[1:14:37] can you believe the things you believe?
[1:14:39] Daddy said so.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Let it be that simple.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; God said so. It's enough.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; It's enough. But it has to be a
[1:14:50] revelation, friends. It's got to be God
[1:14:52] spoke to you. And then you say, "Well,
[1:14:54] what if he don't speak to you?" Then
[1:14:55] you're in a bad place.
[1:14:59] Have you made yourself available? And
[1:15:01] here's here's I think the biggest thing.
[1:15:03] Do you recognize his voice?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Do you sit in church and your mind is
[1:15:08] wondering and then all of a sudden some
[1:15:09] little something just kind of just kind
[1:15:11] of registers a little bit and just
[1:15:13] dismiss it?
[1:15:16] Wait until after this service that we're
[1:15:18] going to worship and praise and we're
[1:15:20] going to have a wonderful foot stomping
[1:15:22] shouting time here in the service. But
[1:15:25] when God was speaking to you, you
[1:15:27] ignored it. You didn't recognize that
[1:15:29] was the main thing.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; That was the main thing. You couldn't
[1:15:33] walk out of here with your faith
[1:15:35] renewed. You walked out of here with
[1:15:36] your confidence, your evidence because
[1:15:38] you shouted and felt the anointing. And
[1:15:40] that'll go away by the time you hit the
[1:15:42] parking lot.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; You've heard it. How many How many times
[1:15:51] people said, "We had such a great
[1:15:53] service. I I am not belitting that at
[1:15:56] all. We need to shout and stump and
[1:15:58] praise and show God and make love to him
[1:16:00] all we can. But if that's all you have,
[1:16:02] you ain't got anything
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; because a sinner comes in and does the
[1:16:07] same thing. And the demons come in and
[1:16:09] do the same thing. They love worshiping
[1:16:11] in the spirit.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Just trust him.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going here. I'm going to run
[1:16:21] out of time. Matthew 11:25.
[1:16:25] Look at Jesus his his attitude towards
[1:16:28] simplicity.
[1:16:31] 11:25. At that time Jesus answered and
[1:16:33] said, "I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of
[1:16:35] heaven and earth, because thou hast hid
[1:16:38] these things from the wise and prudent,
[1:16:39] has revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[1:16:42] Father, for so it seemed good in thy
[1:16:44] sight."
[1:16:46] What's he saying? Thank you for being
[1:16:48] simple and hiding yourself in
[1:16:50] simplicity. Oh, this is going to get to
[1:16:53] me.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; He was He was thanking, Father, thank
[1:16:58] you that these wise and these prudent
[1:17:00] and these theologians and all these
[1:17:02] people with all these degrees and they
[1:17:04] know so much, but you hid it from them,
[1:17:06] but you revealed it to little children,
[1:17:08] spiritual children, babes.
[1:17:16] Think about what he was doing.
[1:17:20] What was the father hiding?
[1:17:24] Ever think of that? He was hiding the
[1:17:26] reality the of who Christ was. He was
[1:17:30] hiding that he was the Messiah. How did
[1:17:31] he do it? By the simplicity. He was too
[1:17:34] simple. They said, "We're not going to
[1:17:36] accept a Messiah like that. He's too
[1:17:38] simple.
[1:17:42] And what's the result?
[1:17:45] By the father hiding his reality, his
[1:17:48] position, who he was, it resulted in a
[1:17:50] crucifixion.
[1:17:54] They killed him because of it.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And he thanked the father.
[1:18:02] That gets to me.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; What kind of a love? What? Why would you
[1:18:07] do that? because the word had to be
[1:18:09] fulfilled.
[1:18:10] If the father would have opened their
[1:18:12] eyes, he blinded their eyes through the
[1:18:13] simplicity. If he would have said, he
[1:18:15] gone to the the the Pharisees and the
[1:18:17] the priests and all, he said, "This is
[1:18:18] the Messiah." And he took the scales out
[1:18:20] their eyes and say, "Oh my goodness, the
[1:18:22] Jesus is the Messiah." They would have
[1:18:25] accepted him
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; and there would have been no
[1:18:29] crucifixion.
[1:18:33] And you and I would be as lost as loss
[1:18:35] could be.
[1:18:40] talk. Look, look at the attitude. Look
[1:18:42] at the character of Jesus to say, "Go
[1:18:44] ahead. Thank you for I know it's going
[1:18:47] to cost me, but thank you for doing that
[1:18:50] so that I can be fulfill my purpose."
[1:18:52] Now, do you have that same attitude? Can
[1:18:55] you be that simple? Can you allow God to
[1:18:56] be that simple? If you have to blind
[1:18:58] their eyes, blind their eyes. But I
[1:19:00] thank you that you're fulfilling the
[1:19:01] word.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; What if it's your family? He's blinded.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; That's what the love of God does,
[1:19:15] friend. Human love don't don't get
[1:19:17] there.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; But God's love will get there and say,
[1:19:21] "Not my will, but thine be done."
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And if you had to blind my family's eyes
[1:19:26] or whoever it is, I thank you for
[1:19:29] fulfilling your word.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; God don't play. He's not playing church.
[1:19:36] He said, "I sacrificed my own son. I
[1:19:38] sent him to Calvary for you." And then
[1:19:40] we want to come and go and and and have
[1:19:41] our evidence because oh, I shouted or
[1:19:43] jumped or I something or or I had this
[1:19:46] all going all this stuff that don't mean
[1:19:47] a thing.
[1:19:51] Well, I went to church. I'm I'm holy. I
[1:19:53] go to church. I'm a believer.
[1:19:56] Where's your evidence?
[1:19:58] Well, I down at the altar 20 years ago,
[1:20:01] I just felt a great baptism of the Holy
[1:20:03] Spirit. That's wonderful. I love that.
[1:20:05] Y'all love that. You had that. Amazing.
[1:20:08] What did he say?
[1:20:12] Because he might have spoke through
[1:20:13] that. That a new birth,
[1:20:16] but not if he didn't speak.
[1:20:19] If there's no revelation to it, it
[1:20:21] wasn't a birth. Because this is a word
[1:20:24] birth. That means
[1:20:26] that means he has to give you a word to
[1:20:29] believe. Yeah.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; And how many times pee especially people
[1:20:34] they're seeking the Holy Ghost and they
[1:20:35] run the altar and they have these great
[1:20:37] sensations and the great there's this
[1:20:39] great outpouring of the spirit and
[1:20:40] baptisms and they have such an awesome
[1:20:42] awesome time and they're just in that
[1:20:44] spirit and it's so wonderful and they
[1:20:46] they think I finally got it. I finally
[1:20:49] got it.
[1:20:53] And six weeks later
[1:20:56] they know nothing changed.
[1:20:59] Wow.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Because their evidence was in some
[1:21:01] fantastic something. I am not belitting
[1:21:04] that. That is wonderful. And we need
[1:21:06] those things. But you got to have it
[1:21:08] based. Your evidence has to be based on
[1:21:10] the revealed word that God spoke to you
[1:21:12] personally.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Nothing else is changing your soul.
[1:21:18] Nothing. And and look at this friends.
[1:21:20] What greater thing can you have than
[1:21:22] take this old nasty nature, this old
[1:21:25] nasty human being, and put a life in
[1:21:27] there, which is God's life, it's eternal
[1:21:30] life. There is no greater miracle than
[1:21:32] that.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; There is nothing greater than that new
[1:21:38] nature coming alive and expressing
[1:21:40] itself. What more do you want?
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; What will you settle for? Why will you
[1:21:46] be satisfied without that?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; That seed inside of you won't be
[1:21:52] satisfied.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; No, it won't.
[1:21:56] Jesus wasn't wasn't thanking God that
[1:21:58] all these people going to be lost. It
[1:22:00] killed him.
[1:22:03] He wept over Jerusalem. He said, "Oh,
[1:22:05] Jerusalem,
[1:22:07] I would have hovered you. I would have
[1:22:08] taken you all but you would not
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; because they were blinded
[1:22:16] for you and I's sake so God could come
[1:22:18] and get us.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; That's the love of God.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; I don't play well with human love. Human
[1:22:27] love doesn't like that.
[1:22:30] Because if God's willing to do that
[1:22:31] there, what's he willing to do with us?
[1:22:35] Oh friends, if God has shown you that
[1:22:37] you are elect, you are there's it's
[1:22:40] impossible to describe how amazing that
[1:22:44] is.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Impossible. Let me quote the prophet. He
[1:22:47] said, "God is so great he can make
[1:22:49] himself simple.
[1:22:51] That's what makes that's what makes him
[1:22:53] so great. So many miss him in the
[1:22:55] simplicity because in simple ways he
[1:22:57] hides himself." Now we know that man
[1:22:59] cannot do this. Man cannot make himself
[1:23:02] great enough to be simple.
[1:23:04] So right away you said, "Well, then what
[1:23:06] am I supposed to do?" You're supposed to
[1:23:07] adopt the attitude of a little kid and
[1:23:10] just trust God and let him come and
[1:23:12] change you the way he wants you to be.
[1:23:14] And that nature inside of you will be
[1:23:16] that and simple. It will be so great,
[1:23:18] but it looks so simple because you can
[1:23:20] look at different people say, "Well, I I
[1:23:22] see this brother and I see him being a
[1:23:25] Christian and I I I see but it's so
[1:23:27] simple. Where are your mighty miracles?
[1:23:30] Have you walked on water, brother?
[1:23:32] What's wrong with you?
[1:23:37] Have you raised the dead?
[1:23:40] Oh, well, I have no confidence in you.
[1:23:45] That's ridiculous, isn't it?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; But how many times do you look at
[1:23:48] yourself and say, "Oh, if I would just
[1:23:50] see more Christ."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; What are you looking for?
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we want to see more Christ. But
[1:23:57] what of Christ is that we want to see? I
[1:24:01] want some kind of physical evidence. I
[1:24:03] say, "I I smoked that tree and it died
[1:24:05] and and I stopped the storm from coming
[1:24:07] and I Oh, shut up.
[1:24:14] Sing to people with those kind of and
[1:24:16] those are necessary. Please don't get me
[1:24:18] wrong. We got to have that. These signs
[1:24:20] must follow them that believe. But don't
[1:24:22] let your evidence be the sign. They
[1:24:25] follow you.
[1:24:27] Your evidence is that God and you have
[1:24:29] become one. You and God are united. You
[1:24:33] are him and his character and his love
[1:24:36] and his his his everything about him. He
[1:24:39] just lives out through you. And yet it's
[1:24:41] so simple. You sometimes stumble it
[1:24:43] over. You look at you say, "I made
[1:24:45] another m I make so many mistakes."
[1:24:48] Praise the Lord that you're not taking
[1:24:50] any credit for it.
[1:24:52] that character that's in you, you can't
[1:24:54] take credit for it.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about this just a minute
[1:24:59] ago before I come out. I was studying on
[1:25:01] this thought the last couple days and it
[1:25:02] was just falling in place. Anointing was
[1:25:04] there and everything. I said, "This goes
[1:25:06] here and this goes here and I said, I'm
[1:25:08] ready to go." Right before I come out, I
[1:25:10] open it up just to go through it again
[1:25:12] and nothing made sense. I said, "What?
[1:25:16] What am I supposed to do?"
[1:25:20] You know what God's saying? You better
[1:25:22] trust me, huh?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You want to go out and be a big
[1:25:25] preacher, you're going to fall over your
[1:25:27] face. You're going to stumble and you're
[1:25:28] going to totally lose it. But if you
[1:25:30] would just trust me, I got something to
[1:25:32] say to these people. Get out of my way
[1:25:34] and let me speak.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:25:38] [Applause]
[1:25:45] brother Bram goes on. He says, "John
[1:25:47] would have never known him." No, sir.
[1:25:49] Had the Holy Ghost not pointed it out.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Ain't that amazing?
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet knowing that he was called
[1:25:57] to identify the Messiah. And one day
[1:25:59] he's going to be there. And he would not
[1:26:01] have known him except the Holy Ghost
[1:26:03] pointed it out, the prophet himself.
[1:26:07] And that same prophet, he testified. He
[1:26:10] said, "This is him." He said, "He's
[1:26:12] going to come. His his fire is with him.
[1:26:14] you know, he's going to he's going to do
[1:26:16] all the things, the mighty things that
[1:26:18] he said he was going to do.
[1:26:21] And then it didn't happen
[1:26:23] the way John thought it was supposed to
[1:26:26] happen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And what did he do? He started
[1:26:29] questioning. He started doubting.
[1:26:34] The greatest prophet,
[1:26:41] are you him?
[1:26:43] Why? His ministry was too simple.
[1:26:48] It was too simple. It couldn't be that
[1:26:52] simple. You're supposed to be kicking
[1:26:54] the Romans out of here. I believe this
[1:26:56] is the way I believe the scripture is
[1:26:58] supposed to be fulfilled. The prophet
[1:27:00] himself had it wrong.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; It wasn't time for him to see it.
[1:27:11] Let me let me go and look at some. Let's
[1:27:13] I'm gonna skip. Let's go to John 14.
[1:27:18] Excuse me.
[1:27:25] Verse one.
[1:27:27] This is when Judas is left. It's at the
[1:27:29] last supper. And though, you know, John
[1:27:30] 14 through17, some of the most amazing
[1:27:32] words ever written down. and and John
[1:27:36] and Jesus is taking his disciples and
[1:27:37] kind of telling them what's going to be
[1:27:38] happening and all this kind of stuff
[1:27:40] give them so much that is g we're going
[1:27:42] to use up to this day just just amazing
[1:27:44] the words of Christ he says let not your
[1:27:46] heart be troubled you believe in God
[1:27:47] believe also in me in my father's house
[1:27:48] are many mansions for not so I would
[1:27:50] have told you I go to prepare a place
[1:27:52] for you and if I go and prepare a place
[1:27:53] for you I will come again and receive
[1:27:55] you unto myself that where I am there
[1:27:57] you may be also and whether I go ye know
[1:27:59] and the way you know
[1:28:03] and Thomas said unto him Lord
[1:28:05] We know not whether thou goest, and how
[1:28:08] can we know the way?
[1:28:11] And what's he starting to say? We're
[1:28:12] going to see these disciples here where
[1:28:14] they were spiritually and how they were
[1:28:16] just totally missing out what was going
[1:28:17] on.
[1:28:19] Those 12 the the 11 those apostles. Why?
[1:28:24] Because they didn't they were not born
[1:28:26] again and they did not see the mysteries
[1:28:27] of God yet.
[1:28:30] Jesus said unto him, "I am the way.
[1:28:33] You've been following me the whole time.
[1:28:35] Keep following me. I am the way, the
[1:28:37] truth, and the life. No man cometh unto
[1:28:39] him to the father but by me.
[1:28:42] People really don't like him saying
[1:28:44] that.
[1:28:45] They want to have other access to the
[1:28:48] father but by him.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you had known me,
[1:28:53] you should have known my father also."
[1:28:56] So he's saying, "You don't even know me.
[1:29:01] Henceforth you know him and have seen
[1:29:03] him. Philip said unto him, Lord, show us
[1:29:06] the father and it sufficeth us.
[1:29:10] In other words, they were not satisfied
[1:29:12] with what was going on.
[1:29:15] Jesus Jesus had just said, "If you had
[1:29:18] known me, you didn't know my father
[1:29:19] also." And henceforth, as you know him
[1:29:20] seen, he said, "Lord, just show us the
[1:29:22] father. We'll be satisfied."
[1:29:24] Why were they not satisfied about?
[1:29:29] because it was he was not fulfilling
[1:29:31] what they wanted him to be.
[1:29:34] He had walked in water, raised the dead,
[1:29:36] multiplied the fishes, and done all
[1:29:38] these mighty things, but he wasn't
[1:29:40] fulfilling what their idea had, what the
[1:29:42] Messiah was supposed to do, what they've
[1:29:44] been taught their whole life, because he
[1:29:46] had not even killed a single Roman yet.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; He hadn't done anything except purge the
[1:29:53] temple and and just kind of ruined their
[1:29:55] whole their whole uh uh religion there.
[1:29:57] and his eyes were getting the Pharisees
[1:29:59] mad, getting the priests mad and getting
[1:30:00] everybody mad. He said, "Just just," in
[1:30:03] other words, why don't you show us the
[1:30:04] father? He'll take care of business.
[1:30:10] They didn't like that this could be the
[1:30:13] point, that this was the Messiah. They
[1:30:15] they could not accept it. They did not
[1:30:17] make sense to them. They're looking for
[1:30:20] something more.
[1:30:24] Jesus said, "Have I been so long with
[1:30:25] you? You have not known me, Philillip.
[1:30:28] He that hast seen me hath seen the
[1:30:30] father. And how sayeth thou, show us the
[1:30:32] father?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Why didn't they recognize it? Why didn't
[1:30:37] they recognize that him that was the
[1:30:39] father? That's the Holy Spirit dwelling
[1:30:41] in that man. Why didn't they recognize
[1:30:43] they they they confess it? You're the
[1:30:45] son of God. You're this. But they yet he
[1:30:47] wasn't fulfilling the scripture the way
[1:30:49] they thought it was supposed to be done.
[1:30:51] And how many times do we stumble over
[1:30:53] that same thing? Yeah,
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; we're the bride of Christ. We're the
[1:30:57] final voice of the final age. We have
[1:30:59] thus sayith the Lord. We keep still.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Where are the mighty works to go with
[1:31:04] that? There and there and there. And
[1:31:07] it's right there among you.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; It's right among us. But what are we
[1:31:13] looking for? Some fantastic something.
[1:31:17] Do you recognize that you are the f I'm
[1:31:19] not a preacher. You are the final voice
[1:31:21] to the final age.
[1:31:23] I'm a sister. I raise my kids. You're
[1:31:26] the final voice to the final age. How
[1:31:28] many sisters, how many women can do what
[1:31:31] you do?
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Raise kids and the ammonition of the
[1:31:38] Lord. Raising kids to to to respect God.
[1:31:43] Raising kids to respect you and their
[1:31:45] daddy. How many people going to do that?
[1:31:47] How many people, how many mothers in
[1:31:50] this world today, in this country, this
[1:31:52] Christian country, spend the time in
[1:31:54] prayer for your family like you do?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And of those, how many actually know
[1:32:05] Jesus Christ?
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; How many are actually praying to a God
[1:32:09] of their imagination?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; You're a special person. Amen.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; And if that makes you puffed up, you
[1:32:21] have no clue what I'm talking about. So
[1:32:22] I ain't worried about it.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; What more evidence?
[1:32:28] He said, he said, "He that has seen me
[1:32:31] has seen the father."
[1:32:36] Are you simple enough to confess the
[1:32:39] same thing?
[1:32:42] Can you dare say that?
[1:32:46] If you've seen me, you've seen the
[1:32:49] father.
[1:32:51] Phil, you are arrogant.
[1:32:54] If I'm saying that in my head, yes, I
[1:32:56] am.
[1:32:58] If that's coming from my heart because
[1:33:00] the Holy Spirit dwells there, I'm just
[1:33:03] confessing the truth. And for me to say
[1:33:05] something else would be unbelief.
[1:33:09] Can you allow him to be that simple? The
[1:33:12] Holy Spirit in you which is the father
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; is confirming the word living through
[1:33:19] you manifesting Christ and people look
[1:33:21] at you and they see the father. Do they
[1:33:24] recognize it? Probably not. Most people
[1:33:26] don't.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; They see you as some weird cultish kind
[1:33:29] of group of people dress funny and act
[1:33:31] funny, believe some strange doctrines.
[1:33:35] Welcome to the body of Christ.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; That's all it is.
[1:33:46] All right, let me let me go to one more
[1:33:48] scripture here. I said one, it'll
[1:33:50] probably be more, but second Corinthians
[1:33:54] 11,
[1:33:59] Satan blinded Eve from the simplicity
[1:34:02] that is in Christ, right? by twisting
[1:34:05] the word projecting a different God
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; than who he was.
[1:34:11] Verse one, would to God you would bear
[1:34:13] with me a little in my folly. This is
[1:34:14] 11:1 Corinthians. And indeed bear with
[1:34:17] me, Paul's talking. He said, I am
[1:34:18] jealous over you with godly jealousy,
[1:34:20] for I have espoused you to one husband
[1:34:23] that I may present you as a chasteed
[1:34:25] virgin to Christ. But
[1:34:29] I fear lest by any means as a serpent
[1:34:32] begiled Eve through his subtlety. That
[1:34:35] word means through his cunning
[1:34:37] craftiness, his false wisdom.
[1:34:42] Begiled Eve through his subtlety. So
[1:34:44] your mind should be corrupted from the
[1:34:45] simplicity that is in Christ. That word
[1:34:47] corrupted means defiled, destroyed when
[1:34:50] even the slightest degree damaged. You
[1:34:52] hear what he said? One word off and it
[1:34:54] destroys it.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. just takes one word and that's all
[1:34:58] he had to do was project a different god
[1:35:00] to Eve than who God was
[1:35:03] to get her to seek after knowledge and
[1:35:07] that simplicity that mean that word
[1:35:08] means singleness sincerity mental
[1:35:11] honesty free from pretense and hypocrisy
[1:35:14] not self-seeking and so Satan was coming
[1:35:16] to Eve he said now has God said she said
[1:35:19] yes God says this he said but now here's
[1:35:21] the reality
[1:35:23] God tells you that because he wants to
[1:35:25] keep you under his thumb cuz he knows if
[1:35:29] you had this wisdom you'd be like him
[1:35:33] and that got her that's what got Lucifer
[1:35:36] well he wanted I just want to be like
[1:35:38] God I want to have the same power God I
[1:35:40] want to be worshiped like God and he's
[1:35:41] saying now you can be like God if you
[1:35:43] have this wisdom
[1:35:45] and God don't want you to have it
[1:35:49] he's portraying a a different character
[1:35:52] of God than what is reality Yeah.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; And that God he he was saying God is not
[1:35:58] sincere. He does not have mental
[1:36:00] honesty. He's not free from pretense and
[1:36:02] hypocrisy. He's self-seeking
[1:36:04] and he he's portraying this kind of a
[1:36:06] God to Eve. And because Eve lusted for
[1:36:09] knowledge and because she wanted to be
[1:36:10] special and she didn't she wasn't
[1:36:12] satisfied with the simplicity of God
[1:36:14] says so, I'm going to believe it. I'm
[1:36:16] going to stand on that. Why? Because she
[1:36:18] could be deceived.
[1:36:20] And God made it that way
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; to fulfill his plan.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; And so he's it says he beguiled her from
[1:36:29] the simplicity
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; that is in Christ.
[1:36:35] He's just not a simple papa. He has some
[1:36:38] ulterior motives.
[1:36:43] Lean on your own understanding. He wants
[1:36:46] to keep you ignorant.
[1:36:50] Friends, when you lean on your own
[1:36:52] understanding, you are taking the word
[1:36:54] of God and hybriding it. And you are be
[1:36:56] you're committing spiritual adultery.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; When you when you have anything as
[1:37:00] evidence besides the simplicity of God,
[1:37:02] you are committing spiritual adultery.
[1:37:08] God don't play.
[1:37:11] He don't play.
[1:37:14] So that's what Satan does with us. He he
[1:37:16] uses subtlety to confuse us to keep us
[1:37:20] He offers a religion of knowledge. He
[1:37:22] offers us something that that that
[1:37:24] appeals to our human nature.
[1:37:27] Anything to keep us from simply
[1:37:29] believing God.
[1:37:31] Verse four, for he that cometh preaches
[1:37:33] another Jesus whom we have not preached.
[1:37:35] Or if you receive another spirit we have
[1:37:37] not received, or another gospel which
[1:37:38] you have not accepted, you might well
[1:37:40] bear with them.
[1:37:44] Why?
[1:37:46] Because it's what we want. Our old
[1:37:49] nature wants that. He's saying, "Well,
[1:37:50] not my old nature." Yes, it does. I
[1:37:52] don't care how born again you are, your
[1:37:53] old nature is still your nasty old
[1:37:55] nature.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; And that's why Satan still has a market.
[1:37:58] He still can get us to to to stumble.
[1:38:00] That's why Paul said, "When I do good,
[1:38:02] then evil is with me." Why? Because even
[1:38:04] Paul still had that old nature.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; That's why we stay simple, humble before
[1:38:11] God. said, "God, either you do this work
[1:38:12] or it's not going to get done. I'm not
[1:38:14] going to help you save me. I'm not going
[1:38:16] to help you by living good enough. I'm
[1:38:17] not going to try to impress you. I'm not
[1:38:18] going to try to earn it. I'm simply
[1:38:20] going to take you at your word." And I
[1:38:22] said, "That's all I ever wanted from
[1:38:24] you. That's all I ever wanted."
[1:38:28] All right. I got this one scripture
[1:38:30] we're going to be we're going to finish
[1:38:31] up here.
[1:38:33] Second Thessal Thessalonians. That's a
[1:38:35] hard word for me. Uh, chapter 2.
[1:38:39] Verse
[1:38:44] seven. And if there's ever a scripture
[1:38:47] that is being fulfilled in our day, this
[1:38:49] is it, friends.
[1:38:52] For the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:38:54] work. Only he that now let us will let
[1:38:57] until he be taken out of the way. Then
[1:38:58] shall that wicked be revealed, whom the
[1:39:00] Lord shall consume with the spirit of
[1:39:02] his mouth, and so shall destroy with the
[1:39:03] brightness of his coming.
[1:39:06] that wicked shall be revealed has been
[1:39:09] revealed. We know who this is. Why?
[1:39:11] Because a message came and exposed him.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Verse nine, even him who's coming is
[1:39:19] after the working of Satan with all
[1:39:21] power and signs and lying wonders.
[1:39:25] And I spoke a minute ago about about the
[1:39:27] beast system and what you know the the
[1:39:29] the funeral out there in Arizona and all
[1:39:31] that.
[1:39:33] That's not deceiving for you and I.
[1:39:36] these signs and power power and signs
[1:39:38] and lie and wonders is in our midst.
[1:39:40] This is within the message ranks. This
[1:39:42] is where Satan's attacking us. And he's
[1:39:44] not attacking us physically yet, but
[1:39:46] spiritually, he's been on our case for a
[1:39:48] long time. And we need to make sure we
[1:39:50] recognize and look around and say just
[1:39:52] because this minister is anointed, just
[1:39:54] because this f uh uh supernatural
[1:39:57] phenomena has happened, whatever, keep
[1:39:59] our eyes focused on Christ.
[1:40:03] Cuz he deceiving people by the signs and
[1:40:05] wonders he's performing in message
[1:40:08] groups and churches and families. Just
[1:40:10] because you can do signs and wonders
[1:40:12] does not mean you're right at all.
[1:40:16] It doesn't mean it friends. You can have
[1:40:18] all that stuff and be a devil.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Let me read a quote from the prophet. He
[1:40:30] said, "Stay right with the word. Stay
[1:40:31] with that. Watch what happens. Say, oh
[1:40:33] Lord, I believe it. Send the Holy
[1:40:35] Spirit." Then watch.
[1:40:38] If he goes to bearing record, then you
[1:40:41] know you got it. There's your evidence.
[1:40:43] He goes to bearing record. Then you know
[1:40:46] you got it. There's your evidence.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Not by some sensation.
[1:40:55] The devils do that.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Not by some miracle. The devils do that.
[1:41:02] That's what our prophet said. He said,
[1:41:04] "Don't be deceived by these things."
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; He said he goes to bearing record. Then
[1:41:10] you know he got What is the record? It's
[1:41:13] Christ in you, the hope of glory. It's
[1:41:16] his character living out through you.
[1:41:18] It's you surrendering to him and growing
[1:41:20] closer and closer. And it's you the the
[1:41:23] the very love of God expressing himself
[1:41:26] through you in ways that you can't even
[1:41:28] touch. And you look at that and say,
[1:41:30] "How in the world is this happening?"
[1:41:32] It's because God is in you expressing
[1:41:35] himself through you.
[1:41:40] You're clapping because you know what
[1:41:42] I'm talking about. You're clapping
[1:41:44] because you see that and yet it's so
[1:41:46] simple. It's so simple and you want to
[1:41:49] believe it. And Satan says, "Don't you
[1:41:51] believe that. Don't you accept that.
[1:41:53] That ain't you. It's not you. That's too
[1:41:56] simple. You should have more than that."
[1:41:58] And you say, "I believe it anyways."
[1:42:00] Why? Because it's the word speaking
[1:42:02] through you and to you. And you are just
[1:42:04] you just have enough faith to just
[1:42:06] confess what God's doing in your life.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; It's happening. It's in you. It's
[1:42:14] expressing yourself, but it's doing it
[1:42:16] such a way. It's not a show
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; out there that the world is making a
[1:42:21] show of Christianity. They're doing all
[1:42:23] these things of Christianity, but in
[1:42:25] you, it's a secret place. It's just you
[1:42:28] and him in a secret place where it's
[1:42:30] just you having that communion. And you
[1:42:32] say, "I just long for more of you." And
[1:42:34] he says, "I long for more of you."
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, the bride and the spirit saying the
[1:42:40] same thing, longing for each other. And
[1:42:42] set everything aside and set all our my
[1:42:44] religion aside. I just want to see
[1:42:46] Christ. He said, "There you are." And
[1:42:48] you say, "But but it was so simple.
[1:42:52] It was so small. How can you do
[1:42:54] something a little more?" He said, "I
[1:42:55] thought you were more mature than that.
[1:43:00] Can you allow him to be simple? Can you
[1:43:03] allow your your evidence to be just the
[1:43:06] manifestation
[1:43:07] of the word?
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Let me finish verse nine. Even him who's
[1:43:12] coming is after the working of saint
[1:43:14] with all power and signs and lying
[1:43:15] wonders and with the deceivleness of
[1:43:18] unrighteousness in them that perish.
[1:43:20] Why? They receive not the love of the
[1:43:23] truth that they might be saved.
[1:43:27] They're Christians. They're message
[1:43:29] believers. They receive the love of the
[1:43:32] miracles. They love the signs. They love
[1:43:35] the supernatural. But they don't love
[1:43:37] the truth. They love the miracles more
[1:43:39] than they love the truth.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why sometime when the
[1:43:50] spirit doesn't move very much in a
[1:43:52] service and it's kind of like a downer.
[1:43:56] Well, I drove all the way to church and
[1:43:58] nothing happened.
[1:43:59] Guess I'll just go home. Hopefully
[1:44:01] something more happens on Sunday.
[1:44:05] You poor miserable
[1:44:07] sign seeker.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; This evil generation seeks after a sign.
[1:44:14] Did God speak? Well, he didn't speak to
[1:44:18] me. Oh, so it's all about you.
[1:44:22] Did he speak to someone else? Were you
[1:44:23] praying that he speak to what? What if
[1:44:25] this person got blessed? What if that
[1:44:26] person got blessed and you it wasn't
[1:44:28] your time?
[1:44:30] You going to pout?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, that got me. I
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; want I I I want I I want I I I
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; I'm way off my nose here, so forgive me.
[1:44:52] What makes a great service?
[1:44:58] I like that. It got real quiet.
[1:45:02] That's what makes a great service. I
[1:45:05] don't care how much you shout amen or
[1:45:06] anything else. If God is speaking to you
[1:45:08] and you're sitting there receiving it,
[1:45:10] that's what makes a great service.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Don't matter if anyone shouted or said
[1:45:14] amen the whole time.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:45:20] H
[1:45:22] we left. Satan's trying to get us leave
[1:45:24] off the main thing. Leave off the main
[1:45:26] thing. The main thing. Go. Let's Let's
[1:45:28] seek for supernatural signs. Let's seek
[1:45:30] for this. Let's seek for that. Leave off
[1:45:31] the main thing. What's the main thing?
[1:45:33] The word spoken to you personally.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; That is a revelation that hell can't
[1:45:40] destroy. Nothing can stand against you.
[1:45:42] The gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:45:44] you if you have that. You say, "Well, I
[1:45:46] shout it." The gates of hell can prevail
[1:45:48] against shouting. Well, I dance the the
[1:45:50] gates of hell can dance right with you.
[1:45:52] Well, I had this great supernatural
[1:45:54] phenomena happen to me. And you know
[1:45:56] what? There's probably demons around you
[1:45:57] dancing with you at the same time.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; But you know what they can't do? They
[1:46:02] can't enter into that secret place with
[1:46:04] you in Christ where he gives you his
[1:46:06] seed. He gives you his word and you take
[1:46:08] it and it brings forth.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; He can't touch you there.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's a good place. That's
[1:46:16] the part that soul, that part of God
[1:46:18] that doesn't have a single fingerprint
[1:46:20] of Satan on it. That's the part the rest
[1:46:22] of you has Satan's fingerprints all over
[1:46:24] it. But that part of you that's that new
[1:46:26] birth, that new life, there's nothing of
[1:46:28] Satan. He has no part in that. And all
[1:46:30] he can do is stand there and scream
[1:46:33] because he's powerless against that.
[1:46:38] That's a precious place to be, friends.
[1:46:43] And for this cause God shall send them
[1:46:45] strong delusions that they should
[1:46:47] believe a lie
[1:46:49] that they might all be damned who
[1:46:51] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[1:46:55] and their gifts
[1:46:59] and their signs and wonders. You say,
[1:47:00] "What about the gifts?" You know what?
[1:47:02] Back 1906 Pentecost, that's what they
[1:47:05] had. That was the word for the day.
[1:47:06] That's not the word for this day. We
[1:47:07] still have the gifts. We don't do away
[1:47:09] with them. But if that's where you're
[1:47:10] still at, you're eating on yesterday's
[1:47:12] mana. And it's rotten. It's warm eaten.
[1:47:16] It stinks.
[1:47:18] The word for the day is Christ and the
[1:47:20] bride. Married becoming one manifest in
[1:47:23] Christ through you.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Believe the lie and
[1:47:33] be damned by it." What is that lie?
[1:47:37] You're born again.
[1:47:44] How many people sitting in message pews
[1:47:47] are believing the lie that they're born
[1:47:50] again because they have some evidence
[1:47:53] besides
[1:47:55] the revelation of God telling you you
[1:47:57] are.
[1:48:00] What's your evidence tonight, friends?
[1:48:03] Well, I had a great experience. The Holy
[1:48:05] Spirit fell. I know I had the baptism of
[1:48:07] the Holy Ghost. I would not doubt that.
[1:48:09] I would not argue. And that's amazing
[1:48:11] thing.
[1:48:13] But was the voice within that baptism?
[1:48:16] Did you hear God speak the still small
[1:48:18] voice through that?
[1:48:22] Or was that all you had?
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; It cuts down close, friends.
[1:48:28] It cuts down close.
[1:48:30] But he's not saying this to taunt you.
[1:48:32] He's not saying this to say, "Well,
[1:48:33] you're all not born. I believe you're
[1:48:35] all born again. Don't don't get me
[1:48:36] wrong, but I'm saying you must make sure
[1:48:38] that you're sure because not because of
[1:48:41] any evidence except the revelation of
[1:48:43] Jesus Christ to you personally because
[1:48:44] brother Brandham said the new birth is a
[1:48:47] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:48:50] you.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; He revealed himself to you personally.
[1:48:53] He doesn't do that through screaming and
[1:48:54] shouting and dancing. He does that
[1:48:56] through his word. It's a word birth. He
[1:48:58] gives you the word. He says, "Believe
[1:49:00] this and watch it take effect." Let's
[1:49:03] stand tonight.
[1:49:19] All that can be shaken will be shaken.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; If the word shakes you and causes you to
[1:49:28] wonder, oh my goodness, man. Well, let
[1:49:30] me check up. What about this? What about
[1:49:32] friends? you. It's such a blessing. You
[1:49:35] thank God for that because if we would
[1:49:38] be shaken now when you still have time
[1:49:39] to get it right, there's going to be a a
[1:49:41] time coming where you're going to be
[1:49:42] shaken without a time to get it right.
[1:49:46] This is a great This is the greatest
[1:49:47] time. This is the best thing that can
[1:49:49] happen. It's be shaken by this to make
[1:49:51] sure you are standing on a solid rock.
[1:49:54] Make sure your evidence is the
[1:49:55] revelation to Jesus Christ. He said, "I
[1:49:57] built my church on the revelation of who
[1:49:58] I am." That's what it must be built on.
[1:50:04] What an opportunity. He's saying, "I'm
[1:50:06] calling you. I want you to be right. I
[1:50:07] want you to get rid of all this other
[1:50:09] stuff." A and even if you're born again,
[1:50:11] sometime we still in our minds, we have
[1:50:13] some junk in there, some false doctrines
[1:50:15] and and some some stuff that we still
[1:50:17] kind of mess with. And he's saying, "Get
[1:50:19] rid of it all. Don't do just there's no
[1:50:21] it means nothing. Get rid of it. Just
[1:50:24] let me be your everything. Let the word
[1:50:26] be your everything."
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; That's all he's asking for. And I
[1:50:30] guarantee you that's all you want.
[1:50:33] That's all you want. Because all we want
[1:50:35] is Christ. Is that right?
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't it wonderful when you see Christ
[1:50:38] in yourself, but also when you see him
[1:50:40] in your brothers and sisters, you can
[1:50:41] come to church and look around and say,
[1:50:43] "I see Christ and I see him. I see
[1:50:45] Christ. I see Christ." It's so amazing.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; What a privilege we have. Let's pray.
[1:50:50] Lord Jesus, we're so grateful, Father,
[1:50:52] that you would come and speak to us
[1:50:54] tonight, Lord. And and it in some ways
[1:50:56] it was a cutting message but in other
[1:50:58] ways it was such a it's such a peaceful
[1:51:01] marriage to recognize that we are
[1:51:03] standing where we are. We are resting in
[1:51:05] this place uh beside the cool waters and
[1:51:08] the green pastures. Why? Because our
[1:51:10] confidence our evidence is the revealed
[1:51:13] word that you have spoken to us and
[1:51:14] you've gotten rid of all the other
[1:51:16] stuff, all the periphery stuff and all
[1:51:18] we want to do is just focus on you. And
[1:51:20] father, we got we find such peace
[1:51:22] tonight knowing that that's where you
[1:51:23] brought us to. And you got such peace
[1:51:25] tonight and knowing that nothing can get
[1:51:27] us out of there. We know that Satan
[1:51:29] would want to get us moved. Want want us
[1:51:31] to get us to get up and walk away? Get
[1:51:33] get us tore up about things. And what do
[1:51:35] you really have it? Do you really not?
[1:51:37] And all you want to do is say just
[1:51:38] believe what I told you. Father, that's
[1:51:41] all you're asking tonight. Will we
[1:51:43] believe? Will we take you at your word
[1:51:44] or will we be will we be corrupted
[1:51:47] through the subtlety of Satan a and
[1:51:49] getting its way for the simplicity of
[1:51:51] simply God speaking to us? Father,
[1:51:54] tonight I believe that you've given this
[1:51:55] word and I believe this word will have
[1:51:57] the effect you wanted to have. And I'm
[1:51:59] asking that it would go to each heart,
[1:52:00] Lord, and just anchor there. And Father,
[1:52:02] if there's something they need, if they
[1:52:04] need more of you, Father, a a new
[1:52:07] revelation, reveal that to each one,
[1:52:09] Father. If they are standing on that
[1:52:11] solid rock, then Lord, just quicken that
[1:52:13] and just just comfort them knowing that
[1:52:15] that's where each person is standing.
[1:52:17] Father, we need to have that comfort. We
[1:52:19] need to have that relationship. We need
[1:52:21] to have your presence. Father, we need
[1:52:22] to know that we know where we're
[1:52:24] standing. And tonight, Lord Jesus, won't
[1:52:26] you come and just quicken that? Speak to
[1:52:28] each heart, Lord, and let them know
[1:52:30] exactly where they are. We ask this,
[1:52:32] Lord Jesus, in your name. God bless you,
[1:52:34] brother and sister. I sure appreciate
[1:52:35] the opportunity to come and speak to
[1:52:37] you. You're great people to speak to and
[1:52:39] I just pray for you all the time and
[1:52:41] pray for me and pray for each other and
[1:52:43] we're going to go into rapture someday.
[1:52:45] It's it's guaranteed, friends. It's
[1:52:47] guaranteed. God bless you.
[1:52:50] [Applause]
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; He is my everything. He is my He is my
[1:52:59] everything.
[1:53:02] He is my all.
[1:53:08] He is my everything
[1:53:13] [Music]

[1:53:20] He gave his life for me.
[1:53:25] He made everything new.
[1:53:31] He is my everything.
[1:53:37] Oh, how about you? Once again, if we
[1:53:41] could.

[1:56:06] Amen. Aren't you glad all is well
[1:56:09] tonight? Amen. pray you enjoyed the word
[1:56:12] tonight. Just just nothing like being in
[1:56:15] the presence of the Lord. And and also,
[1:56:17] you know, Brother Thomas was speaking
[1:56:19] about Brother Biscll and I was thinking
[1:56:21] as brother Biscll's passing and I I
[1:56:24] failed to mention it, but uh I talked to
[1:56:27] Brother Charlie Cox's son and brother
[1:56:29] Charlie Cox really needs your prayer and
[1:56:31] he's wanting to go home. He has stage
[1:56:33] four cancer. He's not doing very well.
[1:56:36] And I I thought, you know, all the most
[1:56:39] about all the brothers that was with the
[1:56:41] prophet, about all of them's gone, you
[1:56:43] know, and ones that stood steady, you
[1:56:47] know, brother Cox and and you know,
[1:56:50] Brother Bisll, but you know, we're all
[1:56:52] going to be going home one of these
[1:56:53] days. Thankful for the message that
[1:56:56] God's given us. God bless you tonight,
[1:56:57] church, and pray that you'll go and pray
[1:57:00] the Lord will go with you tonight. Let's
[1:57:02] sing that little chorus as we go. If
[1:57:03] Jesus goes with me, I'll go anywhere.
[1:57:06] God bless you till 10:30 Sunday morning.
[1:57:08] Well, if Jesus goes with me, I'll go.
[1:57:14] Oh, anywhere.
[1:57:19] Oh, it's heaven to me.
