about ten thousand years amen i believe that was what brother branham said that he wants it amen you'll hear him singing way back down over the holler someday over glory amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me i once was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i see amen god bless you amen want to announce that i want to do it a little bit different this year instead of the last wednesday having up which is in two weeks from now i'd like to do it a week earlier so there'll be no more wednesday evening services after tonight until after the meetings so next wednesday night is when we'll have our cleanup okay because i know i've been down at the fellowship hall i know it needs a complete go through and then up here and out there there's just a lot of work and i know in years past we get the cleaning up and we'd say like well this needs to be done not all there's not enough time you know so this time we'll have enough time to make sure that if there's a little projects or whatever so they can be good and ready amen so would that sound like a good plan amen we want to try to the laurel just help us to get completely ready and so forth we did back get it shampooed that carpet down there it smells good amen it'll do for now so amen will amen eventually maybe have some lonnolium in it but so god bless you richly amen let's just bow our heads and go before the lord kind of heavenly father we come before you lord once again assembling ourselves together in your name knowing god that you have promised that wherever two or three gather in your name there you will be in our midst lord and father we are ever so grateful lord the father that you'll never leave us no forsake us that you promised that you would be with your children even all the way to the end of the world and father we're here and lord we just so grateful father to know that we are yours lord and that you love us that you care about us and that through many dangers twirls and snares you have already brought us lord it was your grace that brought us safe thus far and we know that it will be your grace that takes us all the way home lord and we just love you and we ask god that you bless the meditation of our heart the sermon tonight bless the reading of the word father now and bless every heart that is common those on the radio waves also bless them wherever they are lord with your presence just now father we come before you sincerely in jesus name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will very familiar topic i want to speak on i mean one of the oldest topics ever spoken of but this just seems to be the way the lord even led us to go so we'll go and just speak a few words here on in ephesians the second chapter ephesians 2. thank the lord for that nice rain amen i don't know if you needed it but i know the grass probably praised the lord amen because it certainly was drying up amen praise be to god ephesians 2 and i want to speak about i just really like the music the songs they started with and so forth amen so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours i'm glad your mercy followed me amen and so forth and then amazing grace as we came out so i'm going to talk about love mercy and grace does that sound good love mercy and grace amen ephesians 2 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein time passed you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others amen but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and as raises up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god amen not of works least any man should boast amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen so we find here in verse 4 it's what i really want to begin with he talks about how that god is rich in mercy amen rich and mercy and also talked about for his great love wherewith he loved us down in verse 7 it talks about the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towered us through christ jesus amen for by grace are you saved through faith that night of yourselves it is the gift of god amen amen now we know um and i want to just i don't know really how i'll line this all up but we'll just see how the lord will do but i thought about titling this the exceeding riches of his grace because how many knows that his grace is truly exceedingly rich amen and i really feel like you know a song that was wrote about oh love of god how rich and pure how measureless and strong it shall forever more endure the saints and angels song talks about if we could uh uh if the ocean was filled with ink and skies of parchment made and so forth and if every man on earth was ascribed by trade to try to love to write the love of god the grace of god and the mercy of god isn't that right amen it would drain the ocean dry so my you know attempt at talking about the grace the mercy and the love of god of course you know that's just going to be the grace of god to be able to speak anything that would be a portion of what it would be amen because it truly if it would drain the ocean dry we would be here for a while talking about it right but amen i got to thinking about this and and i've been around and seen a lot up and around my kin folks up north and so forth and and i realized one thing and that is and it happens to myself even i even see it kind of jumping on me and and so forth and all of us have it has it affects each and every one of us but when we talk about uh you know when we talk about the grace of god and and the works of god uh not the works of god but doing works and talk so forth we see that christians nowadays i mean there's a lot of christians that are working and doing things amen to make them feel like well if i do this you know maybe you know i'll deserve to go to heaven or you know if i don't do this and i'm going to be condemned and so forth amen and kind of relying and we can fall into that category because in our hearts none of us wants to do anything wrong right amen and so sometimes we think well you know we want to make sure that i have ever do everything just right you know you know and we do want to do that but your salvation isn't based upon that i mean knows that because we are not saved by works there there's nothing that anybody can do amen to gain your salvation amen the reason that you're afraid or the reason that you don't want to do anything wrong is because you don't want to plead displease the lord is that right but sometimes we get to thinking well you know it just kind of it's just in our nature to try to do this or do that to try to make sure that well i'd be fit for heaven for that but that will never make you fit how many knows that we're saved by grace and i'll tell you there's a lot of folks out there uh you know that are actually working and they absolutely believe that that works and if you do this and you do that you know if you do this you ain't going to heaven you know if you do this over here you're going to hell you know and and so forth but it's not that way how many knows that we are saved by grace now we know that grace comes from derives from love amen imagine that right because love is the most power god is love that's what god is the essence of love is what god is and from that amen like when you have love for somebody you have grace for somebody don't you yeah but if you don't have love for somebody you're not going to have a lot of grace amen you're going to condemn them for every little thing they do and they're going to you're going to pick them to death it's because there is no love there amen so we know that god is rich in mercy brother branham he's got such a revelation until he preached a message god rich in mercy because he realized every christian realizes that's one thing that god is really rich in and that's mercy that's love and that's grace i like that song don't you i saw love mercy and grace amen i saw love mercy and grace amen i envisioned his beauty and i looked upon his face and what did i see but love mercy and grace amen there's a whole chapter and i won't read it all but i want to just start a couple of them amen in one's psalms 136 if you want to write it down the psalmist david he goes to talking of at least i don't know how many verses it is 26 verses that each one of those verses had about the mercy of the lord oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good i mean god is truly good for his mercy endureth forever amen he goes on oh give thanks unto god of god's for his mercy endureth forever amen we want to talk about you know about the ones that god has mercy on and and some people that god doesn't have mercy on amen and mostly i want to say this that even the ones that he ends up not having mercy on is people that he showed a lot of mercy to already amen so now look we'll just go down through here think about it here god rich in mercy one of the first places that we find that god was rich in mercy was of course in the garden of eden after adam and eve fell amen and how many knows that mercy always love and mercy always provides a way makes the way out of the situation that you're in that's why i love that song it was grace that brought us safe thus far it was it'll be grace that leads us safely home amen praise the lord how many lives by grace every day every day there's grace in your life there's mercy in your life because of the love of god now how many knows truly what the love of god is it's truly love of god the prophet of god taught us that god is love is elective love amen the fact that god elected you shows that he loves you amen it's elective love that's what god's love is amen we find that cain not king and abel but uh with adam and eve he provided them a lamb skin isn't that right he killed the lamb and made a substitute that was going to be their covering that covers them temporarily right and they ended up going having to be driven from the garden covered in lamb skin praise be the god now he knows that we're still covered by lambskin the lamb of god amen we're covered by the lamb of god tonight even god made that he provided for him and then amen after after all of that we know that adam and eve had a couple of children and amen and so forth and and with cain and abel and cain drove cars rose up and bashed abel's head in out in the field killed him murdered him and god can you imagine what his sentence should have been automatic death but god didn't kill him did he god didn't kill him and not only that but he came and god came to him said where's your brother and so forth how are you brother and then god had mercy on even cain and said look if you'll do like abel did you'll be accepted god was going to accept him after he done all that if he'll just repent i'll accept him that's truly mercy i mean believe that you know there's nobody let me say this there is absolutely nobody that hasn't been shown mercy by god whosoever believeth him and should not perish but have everlasting life john 3 16 that's mercy to the whole world his mercy is so great that he wants to pardon the sins of anybody everywhere wow that's a pretty gracious god wouldn't you say that's pretty rich in mercy thank god for his rich mercy praise be to the lord i'll tell you this i believe god is much more richer in mercy than you and i are we are not near as patient as pe with people as what god is our patience just doesn't go that far you let somebody do you wrong a hundred times no you won't even let him do that much will you huh about 15 20 depends on who it is huh that's right depends on who it is and everything else remember peter said to jesus one time he says how many times i might forgive my brother seven times in a day that was a pretty big number probably for peter hot-headed guy don't be messing up again right you done did it three times seven times in a day and jesus says i say unto you not seven times but seven times seventy times in a day seven times seven times in a day 490 right 490 times a day that's pretty rich in mercy [Music] and think god is that rich in mercy for you and i because i'm here to tell you how many knows if it isn't the grace the mercy of god none of us make it in the first place if you're relying on your words first time a wrong thought goes through there hello you know not even the d just a thought because as a man thinking it's in his heart so is he you know amen so god thank god for mercy folks thank god for grace amen we look on down we see how that amen he has doesn't save us by works we're not saved by works but we're saved by grace through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god now we know that abraham god god chose abraham let's talk about real mercy before we get into that that's my let me go back a little bit further can we go back let's go back to the days of noah look at the mercy they had now how many knows that let me come down here get personal here with y'alls wake you up on the wednesday night i know it's been a hard day all right with brad and all of y'all it's right here right this is four five six seven i need one more one more we'll include brother brian all right brother brian i gotta do my math right here right here see this group right here in the andaluvian destruction this is all that was saved this is it is that a big crowd it's not even all of y'all can you imagine eight people eight people all the rest of them drowned it isn't that right where do you find mercy and brother father that's not a whole lot of mercy the whole world was annihilated killed all except hey yeah that's exactly right but the mercy part of it was in what can somebody tell me that where was the mercy at that's right 120 years of mercy you know i would say a lifetime but back then they lived about 800 years so i can't do that before the flood they lived a long time isn't that right but it's still 120 years of crying out to them and begging him and giving him mercy and and reaching out his hand he had a lot of mercy i want you to know that god gives mercy to the unbelievers but if they continue to disbelieve that mercy runs out and they have to be judged for their unbelief mercy never runs out for a believer it only runs out for the unbeliever that mercy finally come to an end and when it was over with it was over with and he drowned them all because they wouldn't accept his mercy now what the prophet teaches he says he says if you do not accept god's mercy amen you have to accept and stand his punishment only two opposition only two ways to go either take god's punishment or accept his mercy amen i've said it before can i say it again god knew that we needed a lot of mercy he knew how fallible we are and that's why he didn't say peter yeah you're right that's going to be our keynote but you tie on or bind on earth will be bound in heaven we'll give everybody seven chances in a day and then that'll be it no he wasn't that short on mercy he went to 490 times folks i don't know about you but somebody would be doing you right wrong on a constant constant i don't know how many seconds every few seconds every few minutes you know to get 490 times in praise the lord so we look at this and we see that they were given lots of mercy they were given lots of grace they should god showed him a lot of love but then when they would not hear god destroyed him because they wouldn't listen they wouldn't accept mercy except eight people amen i wonder how many will be going in the rapture just a handful perhaps amen then we go on down take a little further journey down to abraham how many knows that god came and called abraham and that calling is the same kind of calling that god calls you with i mean he knows what that is that is god calling and god electing abraham now when he put adam on a basis he put him on a basis that if you don't need to do tree if you don't do this out of the other you'll live and everything will be fine but he couldn't keep it could he and he but god says look i have blessed thee and i will multiply thee he never he gave him an unconditional covenant not if you do this and i did i have already done it i'm going to see to it that it's going to happen now you talk about grace because true mercy true grace is what god had for you before the foundation of the world real mercy is for god to choose you amen for god to choose you and when does he do that he did that before the foundation of the world that's true mercy revelation 13 and 8 says and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world hallelujah now that's real mercy the thing that he knew abraham he called abraham said abraham i'm calling you i'm blessing you this is a unconditional saving and abraham believed him abraham believed god and god imputed that faith that belief upon abraham as righteousness now how many knows that goes for every child of abraham every son and abraham dollar abraham comes to god amen that's what it's based upon when god accepts your faith it is upon imputed unto you for righteousness amen god picks who he wants to have mercy on isn't that kind of strong brother butler you really need some scriptures for that okay run with me romans 9. romans 9 and verse 11 says for the children but let's go back one so we know what we're talking about and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil verse 11 that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth oh my when i get to thinking about the mercy and the grace of god i get to thinking about how that paul said he didn't have begun to work and you is able to perform it how many relies on how many believes that with all your heart that god has started working you and he'll finish it amen it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger and as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated my what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid amen for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy say stay seated now don't get too happy about this if god showed you mercy aren't you blessed aren't you a privileged person tonight and god has shown his mercy on you if god has called you if god has accepted your sacrifice of repentance if he has filled you with the holy ghost you can't shouldn't hardly be able to stand yourself to think it wasn't you you thought it was you but it was him long before you ever come in the picture he chose you before the foundation of the world if he's chosen you at all amen you were saved before the foundation of the world if you're ever going to be saved you save there you ain't got to have no fear of being lost no sir oh my he says i'll have mercy on who i want to have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion oh i tell you what i just don't know the words to say to people that want to try to tell god how to run his business they want to try to tell her what god is just what's not just and all of that he's god he can do what he wants and i guarantee you this whatever he does is just let me just say this to somebody that would be a critic of god and the way that he chooses and so the way that he willeth you just have a scribbled up mind yet because god's mind's not scribbled up he doesn't do it wrong not one bit he's way too perfect to do anything wrong it's not god that hasn't got it right it's people that don't have it right we come god's way or we don't come you don't have to accept the mercy of god no you can curse him use his name in vain defy him and everything else that you want you can do that but one thing you won't do is escape his judgment you won't escape the punishment for that that you won't do no matter how much you think you will that's exactly right if you do if you do escape it he'll have to raise sodom and gomorrah and apologize if homosexual if homosexuality and lesbianism is okay you'll have to raise up sodom and gomorrah and apologize all right but if it's wrong you're going to burn just like they burn you're going to perish just like they perished you don't you don't mark god what a man shows he will surely reap that wasn't in the script but in god's script is that all right now you can accept and accept his mercy and believe god know that that that verse i've preached on it before and i really really liked the last time i preached it but it just came in my mind again the other day revelations one and seven says behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen what does he say every i shall see him [Applause] all these naysayers and jesus ain't right christianity right all of them are hypocrites all of everything you can be as negative you want to he didn't really die but when you look upon him huh when you look at it and you know that is christ and that he died for your sin huh when they look at him they're gonna fail because they know they rejected the truth when they heard it and they're gonna start weeping and wailing just seeing him will do it there's your evidence all of your unbelief is gone now cause right there it is here he is that's how it's gonna be folks you can deny him all you want to know but you're gonna look at him one day even then it pierced on him pierced his side and everything else if god be the son of god come off the cross they all had to doubt but when they see him again there's not going to be any doubt anymore [Music] and they'll know they're condemned they'll know they're going to be damned because of not receiving him and not believing that the mercy that he had on calvary they turned down whosoever will let him come that's the message and they chose not to come amen amen and they do it who is kind of strong the gospel is because they're not of god they're of the devil that's why they don't do it it's because they're not of god they're not children of god oh they get so mad at you oh they could kill you for that didn't the pharisees do does this that to jesus whenever he says my words have no place with him abraham is not your daddy the devil is your daddy took up stones saw him he had to go out vanish out in the middle of whoo my that's that's god limit and you you think god's dumb god's not dumb god knows to have who knows who to have mercy on god knows who to call god knows who to elect before you draw your first breath as a baby god already knows whether to choose you or not he knows whether to put your name down before you took your first breath boy they'll tell you if god has done something in your life and you know you're one of his that's the happiest person in the world you ought to be the happiest person in the world to know that god has accepted you they have received you can't stand the heart it's just awesome through many dangers too many toils through many snares we have already come and we're still praising god we're still happy we've still got the peace of god we've escaped every snare twirl of the devil that he put out there why because god is taking you through you're not taking yourself through god is taking you through [Music] oh my that's mercy and a love is an election god knowing what people will do amen that's right praise be to god you love him in saint john 6 and verse 37 jesus says all that the father giveth me might make it they might come to me how many knows in any kind of a contract that word shall means you shall it means you will do it you better do it giveth me shall come to me glory and him that cometh to me i'll decide whether i want to keep him no hallelujah come up to me i will in no wise cast out how many believe that if you're saved tonight you are safe and secure you are in the hands of god no man can pluck him out of my father's hand jesus said ain't nothing going to pluck you out of his hand if he saw you there before the foundation of the world he knew what you wanted he knew your seed he knew who you were this is where it gets a little strong but even the faith that you have huh well i believed god and god had to accept me no now what my bible says my says we are saved by grace through faith and that not of yourself it is what the gift of god it is the gift of god that gives you the faith to come to christ amen it's the gift of god settle down y'all calm down think about it that's true grace that's true mercy [Applause] that's real love god knew i don't have to understand it all all i knew is he knew me he knew what was in here young people listen older people too i see young people different times sometimes people struggle for years to get the baptism of the holy ghost i want to get saved i just can't get saved i just can't save it's a it's a nightmare folks it's a horrible place to be and that you're trying to get saved and you can't seem to get saved you want to repent you want to do this out of the other huh it's terrible you watch people sometimes maybe yourself maybe maybe there's so is out there to finally something happens i mean knows that something that happens has to be when god come down and he calls you when god calls your name when he gives you that faith to believe it's going to be a finished work it's going to be all over amen you'll break through that sound barrier something happened in your heart and i'll tell you what no beer no drugs no crack nothing else will ever satisfy you again all of those appetites go by the wayside the only thing you long long thing you thrive for the only thirst that you have is for more of that peace that's in your heart amen that peace that's in your heart you love him oh my let's go them a little further let's just talk about a couple shall we people who really appreciated the grace of almighty god and his mercy how many knows god was merciful with israel wasn't he very merciful his mercy just endured endured endured when dayth and korra did what they did and so forth god said moses separate yourself they that went off in the idle worship and everything else and just separate yourself from the whole bunch and i believe if i'm not wrong if i remember right god said something about and i'll consume them in a moment how many knows god would just have to wave his hand a little bit everybody just they'd be dead instantly how many knows if god's hanging on you every day you could just drop over and be gone every day that you live is grace every breath that you draw is grace every bit of strength that you have is grace it's the mercy of almighty god because when he draws your heart folks one way or they'll be one amen but he could have just done that to the whole crowd for their unbelief for their hardness of heart stubborn people how many knows that whenever the pharisees talked about the israelites and so forth and how they ate manna in the wilderness jesus says dear everyone dead when he says that about lazarus he says he sleepeth there's a big difference between sleeping and being dead dead is total separation from god all those adult people that of israel is all wasting their time god was wasting not wasting his time but moses fell into breach didn't he said god don't destroy and the enemies will say that god took him out there and couldn't take him on in and moses is the grace and the love of god in moses heart fell in the breach for those people and gave them another chance which we know that katie's barnea be a complaint for the last time when the spies came back and brought an evil report and a good report and they believed their uneven report and they went back out in the wilderness for 40 years and everyone perished their children went in amen so they ended up perishing after all for not what believing amen i will say there is one thing that you must do to be saved one thing you must do to be saved somebody tell me what it is believe the word is belief he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damn you have to believe when those people look upon him they didn't believe before they believe now but it's too late right to believe in that faith in that truth is giving you as a gift of god that's why we ought to be so happy if you're a christian tonight amen cain was given grace given mercy shown love after killing abel david was the same also david had killed a man murdered him in that right was it samuel i believe came to david told him the story of the little lamb that a man took took his only lamb killed it and so forth and david said what should we do to that man david said samuel asked david what should we do david said that man shall surely die he shall surely die it was a different story when samuel says hey david you're the man you're the man but you shall not surely die he was shown mercy he the mercy of god how many knows so many times we don't deserve the mercy of god no we don't that's what mercy is that's what grace is unmerited favor with god greatness unmerited favor with god that's because you did something amen but it's simply the mercy and grace of almighty god amen saul named paul later we know that he was also guilty of contoning and taking part in the murder of stephen in the new testament saul before he was paul i mean before he was paul saul amen he was a persecutor of the church of the living god that right persecuted her and even held the people's coats while they went and stoned stephen so he can donate to it he was part in it amen in today's laws if you're driving a getaway car of somebody that gets shot you get guilty of murder too right and when he was struck down on the road to damascus he found the true grace of god he tried he found out what the mercy of god really was that he deserved to die he was guilty of that he was guilty of trying to kill the very one that he was claiming to serve why persecute us thou me jesus says and right after he was struck down by the light he realized what the grace of god was and he wrote about the grace that has been given to me in the dispensation amen amen praise the lord there's that little squawk i was talking about you love the lord how many just wants to say god let me enjoy and and with your mercy so much every day i live i thank god for his mercy and for his grace and then you think i want to bring one more just one more little thought in closing the hour in which we live but the brand talked about it in the god of mercy talk about the age that we look at where we're living look at the times that we're in look at all the different religions which way is right and in the midst of all of that god comes down and proves himself alive like never before and shows us the way it says this is the way and it's right back to the word amen in all of this chaos that we're in amen seeing all the different religions i've seen a lot of amish mennonite holdermen all different kinds of amish last weekend and i said to who was it i think it was my cousin talking about each one of them actually proves that their tradition and their the way that they believe isn't isn't right because i don't think any of them would be so narrow-minded as to say look if you have a tractor with steel wheels on it you'll be able to go to heaven but if it's got rubber tires you're going to hell huh or you know just it was just so many different little things and then go on to people that even have cars i remember my unc my uncle so it said to my my first cousin david he said when he was leaving the army she's kind of leaving down me and he says just don't buy a car don't have a car and david says they were having a conversation i'd seen the conversation he was at the funeral and they were over there talking and he was trying to tell him don't get a car he says well i'll tell you what i won't if you just won't ride in once it's so wrong i said that was a good one oh it's you go to hell if you drive a car but you can ride you can hire them all day your mom's folks say buy the truck just put it in the english boy's name and have him come and haul him and a lot of his boys do that huh it amazes me that the folks can't see that it's pharisees again all over the place it's hypocrisy all over again right so i said so david so in other words when you're riding in the passenger seat you're going to heaven but change seats and you're going to hell don't make a lot of sense does it it goes to prove that it's really not anything to do with doing this little thing anything outside of the bible it's all man's tradition it's teaching for doctrine the commandments of men is all it is amen and the devil's got them so fooled that they don't even see that themselves if they would ever get to see that to realize hey you know i wouldn't want to condemn all of them folks are going to hell or those folks because they're doing the same thing i am just have their boundaries and so forth you got to realize it's get under the blood of jesus christ come to the word of god that's what this message does come out of all that come to the word of god don't let the pastor don't let nobody teach anything but what that bible says it's back to the word then we could all be brothers and sisters and everything will be fine but it's the devil that keeps all those barriers all those fences up amen god bless you let's stand musicians if you'll come aren't you glad for the mercy and the grace that god has shown you tonight the love that he had for you to show you that mercy and that grace that desire that you have for more of god it's not just their accidental that's just not a natural that is something that god has placed in your heart i want more of jesus more and more and more don't you amen let's sing that little course i will sing of the mercies of the lord forever i will sing you'll come
