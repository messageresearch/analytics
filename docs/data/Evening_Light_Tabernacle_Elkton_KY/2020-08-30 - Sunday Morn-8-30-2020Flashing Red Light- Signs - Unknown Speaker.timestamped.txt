[41:23] that we don't have to fear death we
[41:25] don't have to worry about what's over
[41:26] there for we already have been shown
[41:28] what is over there lord and we know
[41:30] there's a wonderful land just beyond the
[41:32] river god
[41:33] and we look forward lord jesus god when
[41:35] you're going to clean this world up
[41:37] father and we're going to come back lord
[41:38] jesus upon this earth
[41:40] lord to dwell where there is
[41:42] righteousness and holiness where there's
[41:44] now one evil thing upon the face of the
[41:47] earth lord
[41:48] and we have assembled ourselves together
[41:50] this morning to prepare for that time
[41:51] and for that place
[41:52] and we ask god that you just bless the
[41:54] reading of the word the meditation of
[41:56] our heart lord
[41:57] and father as we speak on you father we
[41:59] ask god that you'd be the speaker say
[42:00] what you want said lord keep us from

[42:04] and come down in a special way and
[42:05] anoint each one
[42:07] with your presence father and may we be
[42:09] able to go from this place this morning
[42:11] being able to say did not our hearts
[42:13] burn within us as you spoke to us along
[42:15] the way
[42:16] for we ask these blessings in jesus name
[42:18] amen and amen
[42:20] turn if you turn your bibles if you will
[42:22] and i want to just
[42:24] i was just just praying what the lord
[42:26] wanted me to speak on and
[42:28] this thought came to my mind and that
[42:31] was
[42:32] uh flashing red light signs
[42:36] flashing red light signs and i think all
[42:39] of you all know the message brother
[42:40] brandon preached on the flashing red
[42:42] light sign of his coming in them right
[42:44] so brother branham back then he looked
[42:46] at it amen and
[42:47] seen that it was a flashing light saying
[42:50] he's about ready to come amen
[42:52] and certainly how many knows that as the
[42:55] days and as the years roll on
[42:58] amen that it's just makes it so much
[43:00] more true
[43:01] and it just brings us so much more
[43:03] closer to that time
[43:05] the great time that lays ahead who's
[43:07] looking for that time
[43:09] amen so god bless you let's turn our
[43:12] bibles to the book of matthew
[43:15] matthew the 24th chapter
[43:34] and verse 32 a very familiar scripture
[43:36] for us
[43:37] now learn the parable of the fig tree
[43:39] when his branch is yet tender and
[43:41] putteth forth his leaves
[43:43] you know that summer is nice so likewise
[43:45] ye when ye shall see
[43:46] all these things know that it is near
[43:49] even
[43:50] at the doors verily i say unto you this
[43:53] generation
[43:54] shall not pass till all the things be
[43:56] fulfilled
[43:57] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[43:59] word shall not
[44:00] pass away but of that day and that hour
[44:04] knoweth no man no not the angels of
[44:06] heaven but my father only
[44:08] but as the days of noah were so shall
[44:10] also the coming of the son of man be
[44:13] for as for as in the days that were
[44:16] before the flood
[44:17] they were eating and drinking marrying
[44:19] and giving in marriage
[44:21] until the day that noah entered into the
[44:23] ark
[44:24] and knew not until the flood came and
[44:26] took them all away so also
[44:28] the coming of the son of man be two
[44:31] shall be in a field the one shall be
[44:32] taken and the other one left
[44:35] two women shall be grinding at the meal
[44:36] the one shall be taken and the other one
[44:39] left watch therefore for no
[44:42] for ye know not what our the lord doth
[44:44] come amen
[44:45] god bless the reading of the word you
[44:47] can be seated this morning
[44:50] amen i want to talk a little with the
[44:52] help of the lord about the days of noah
[44:54] amen and now over in saint
[44:56] luke all right saint luke and i might
[44:59] just pick this
[45:00] up again saint luke
[45:05] bearing record of what jesus said he put
[45:07] it this way because he added
[45:10] he added just a little something there
[45:12] in luke 17.
[45:19] and i do have several scriptures to read
[45:23] this morning so y'all bear with me if
[45:24] you would
[45:25] luke 17 and verse 26 luke said he says
[45:30] and as it was in the days of noah
[45:32] so shall it also be in the days of the
[45:35] son of man
[45:36] all right and then he says they married
[45:38] the given in marriage until noah entered
[45:40] into the ark and the flood
[45:41] came and destroyed them all and notice
[45:44] here he adds this
[45:45] in he says likewise also as it was in
[45:48] the days of lot they did he
[45:50] they drank they bought this old planet
[45:52] to marry i mean they built it
[45:54] but the same day that lot went out of
[45:55] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[45:58] heaven
[45:59] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[46:01] it be
[46:02] in the day when the son of man is
[46:05] revealed
[46:07] i'm going to read another one in luke
[46:09] 21st chapter
[46:12] verse 25 luke 21
[46:16] it talks about the signs how that
[46:18] there's going to be signs
[46:20] and then i truly believe that there's
[46:22] ever a time and never a people that
[46:24] should be watching these signs it should
[46:26] be us
[46:27] don't you think because jesus said watch
[46:30] watch watch watch in that right be
[46:31] careful watch
[46:32] there'll be signs there'll be all kinds
[46:34] of things that tell you kind of what
[46:36] hour that you're living in where you're
[46:38] at
[46:38] amen and towards the end of the service
[46:41] hopefully i want to
[46:42] kind of talk to you a little bit about
[46:44] just something that was kind of
[46:46] quickened to me here even in the last
[46:47] few days
[46:48] of another sign one of the signs that i
[46:51] think is certainly
[46:54] a real sign to us that we're close amen
[46:57] and i'll i'll get to that here in a
[46:59] little bit but here in chapter 21 verse
[47:02] 25 it says and there shall be signs in
[47:04] the sun
[47:05] and in the moon and in the stars
[47:08] and upon the earth distress of nations
[47:13] perplexity the sea and the waves roaring
[47:17] men's hearts failing them for fear and
[47:20] for looking after those things which are
[47:22] coming on the earth for the powers of
[47:24] the heaven
[47:25] shall be shaken and then shall they see
[47:28] the son of man
[47:29] coming in a cloud with power
[47:32] and great glory now notice he says
[47:37] that they'll see him coming in a cloud
[47:40] with power and great glory i'm not a
[47:43] prophet so i'm not here to interpret the
[47:44] word
[47:45] but if you notice how many knows that he
[47:47] did come in the cloud
[47:49] he made that arizona cloud he became in
[47:51] the cloud and he certainly did come
[47:54] with great power amen
[47:57] and great glory because notice here it
[48:01] says then
[48:01] after that after he comes with the power
[48:04] and that great glory
[48:05] and when you and when these things begin
[48:08] to come to pass
[48:10] then look up and lift up your heads
[48:13] for your redemption draweth nigh
[48:16] how many believe the cloud has come and
[48:18] so forth amen the great power god has
[48:20] come
[48:21] in great power he says then do what then
[48:24] lift up your heads man for your
[48:28] redemption draweth night brother ben
[48:30] you know he made a statement about
[48:32] always being preaching on
[48:34] the resurrection the resurrection the
[48:35] resurrection i always meant a lot to him
[48:37] you know and i don't think you can much
[48:39] separate the resurrection from the
[48:41] coming of the lord because it's at that
[48:43] time the resurrection takes place
[48:45] i mean how many knows right at the time
[48:47] that the resurrection
[48:50] place is when our lord returns amen
[48:54] sure amen because he'll come and the
[48:56] dead and christ shall rise first the
[48:58] trump shall sound
[48:59] amen and we'll meet the lord in the air
[49:01] so shall we ever
[49:02] be with the lord so to me it doesn't
[49:05] matter and i seem to talk about this a
[49:07] lot and
[49:08] and preach on it a lot about the coming
[49:10] of the lord but i do believe that
[49:12] it is our when we certainly need to keep
[49:14] our heads
[49:16] looking in the right direction how many
[49:19] believes it's easy to get caught up
[49:20] nowadays
[49:22] amen to get to get your get your eyes
[49:24] focused on other things get your
[49:26] head to where it's not looking up
[49:28] because it says when you begin to see
[49:29] these signs
[49:30] when you begin to see all these distress
[49:33] between the nations
[49:35] amen that's one of the signs and that
[49:36] when you see the nation's distress
[49:38] and when have we ever had such a
[49:40] distress
[49:41] between the nations even amongst our
[49:44] allies and so forth amen there's a lot
[49:46] of stress
[49:47] a lot of friction that goes on a lot of
[49:49] stress between the nature
[49:51] we see this distress that's upon the
[49:53] earth distress upon the nations upon the
[49:56] people
[49:57] now we could probably sit here and we
[49:59] could probably go with about
[50:00] 50 different finds all right we could
[50:02] probably talk about a lot of different
[50:03] ones we won't cover
[50:04] uh you know you know a lot of them but
[50:06] we'll cover just what we feel led of the
[50:08] lord this morning to talk about
[50:10] amen and i want to talk a little bit
[50:12] about the days of noah but
[50:13] uh i truly believe that for you i don't
[50:16] know about you but i truly believe it is
[50:17] a time that we look up and that we watch
[50:19] the signs
[50:20] around us of what's going on amen
[50:23] and as you and i know we realize that
[50:26] our lives are changing because the times
[50:29] are changing and
[50:30] amen and there's probably things that
[50:33] will never go back to normal amen
[50:36] it'll never go back to the way that it
[50:38] was
[50:39] amen there's a lot of things that won't
[50:40] go back you know because we're going on
[50:42] down and
[50:43] aiming it's coming and it's winding up
[50:46] amen so let me just say this not just
[50:49] maybe
[50:49] perhaps make a quick statement and that
[50:51] is that the one of the signs
[50:53] amen of humanity one of their signs is
[50:56] that
[50:57] we as human beings people without the
[51:00] holy ghost how many knows they're
[51:01] really natural they're just brute beasts
[51:04] amen
[51:05] and so you know humanity brother bam he
[51:08] makes a statement he talks about how
[51:10] that
[51:11] uh man he says god don't destroy
[51:14] man man destroys himself how many knows
[51:18] that
[51:18] he actually destroys himself god don't
[51:21] have to do it
[51:22] man does that all by himself
[51:25] listen he says brother baby says and may
[51:27] i stop here just a minute to say i
[51:28] believe that the people are
[51:30] in preparation for the last
[51:33] great destruction this this
[51:36] world that it has ever known i believe
[51:39] we're at the end amen you can speak to
[51:42] people you can put
[51:43] billy graham in every city in the united
[51:46] states
[51:47] they'd drink wispy and smoke cigarettes
[51:49] and laughed
[51:50] at you and everything else just the same
[51:53] he says they are
[51:54] in the spirit of the last
[51:57] days amen now
[52:00] let me just stop there let me finish let
[52:03] me finish the quote
[52:04] and god cannot send destruction before
[52:07] the people are in the spirit
[52:09] of destruction
[52:13] all right because we know that before
[52:16] when when god you know when god does
[52:18] destroy this place
[52:19] when god finally does his throne when
[52:21] the destruction actually comes
[52:24] we all know that it is going to be
[52:26] completely
[52:27] unimaginable horrific
[52:30] terrible is that right even the
[52:34] california earthquake i believe brother
[52:36] brown says that when that goes down
[52:37] people will die
[52:38] like rats amen we're talking and not so
[52:43] much to perhaps all the sinners and the
[52:45] homosexuals we know they got it coming
[52:47] but what about all of those little
[52:49] children
[52:50] huh what about all the babies what about
[52:53] all the children that'll go along with
[52:55] it
[52:57] amen it'll be something that that's
[52:59] something that you can't imagine it'll
[53:01] be
[53:02] catastrophic it'll be universal it'll be
[53:05] world over
[53:06] when it actually comes and we are seeing
[53:09] that it's getting
[53:11] in ambition how many believe that people
[53:14] are getting into the spirit
[53:16] to where they're fit for destruction
[53:21] in other words they're getting fit for
[53:23] destruction brother brahma said
[53:25] said they were getting in the spirit of
[53:27] destruction
[53:28] amen they're getting ready for
[53:31] destruction
[53:32] they're reaching that place they're
[53:33] coming to that place
[53:35] to where god finally will say that's
[53:37] enough that's it
[53:40] amen and we also already know
[53:43] how many knows that we've had we've had
[53:45] a lot of uh
[53:47] uh close calls of uh
[53:51] the whole world going up into uh
[53:55] a nuclear war
[53:58] and it was i'm not sure if it was russia
[54:00] or america
[54:01] i think it was america one time that we
[54:04] put up a test missile
[54:05] and russia was on the highest of alert
[54:07] because it was going up and they thought
[54:09] it was coming their way
[54:11] but just before they retaliated they
[54:13] said that it veered off into a different
[54:15] direction but they were not ready
[54:16] they didn't realize what we was going to
[54:18] do and they said it was
[54:20] came real close you know many times he
[54:23] come real close
[54:25] and didn't brother ben say you know all
[54:27] it'll take is one man pulling that lever
[54:29] or whatever just one drunk
[54:32] or you know or somebody to come and
[54:33] tweet this out or the other so basically
[54:35] brother band says that god is the one
[54:37] that
[54:37] keeps those accidents from happening
[54:39] he's the one that holds it back
[54:42] that right he's the one in control of it
[54:45] because no doubt china no doubt russia
[54:49] no doubt
[54:50] we have countries that would just love
[54:52] to pull the trigger on us
[54:54] you know right but they realize that the
[54:56] prophet said that if they send it this
[54:58] way it's coming that way
[55:00] now how many knows that this they have
[55:02] enough power to have enough
[55:03] nukes now i don't know how many times
[55:05] over but it's many times over to
[55:08] completely annihilate and kill
[55:11] everybody upon the face of the earth
[55:12] many times over
[55:14] i mean they don't just have one they
[55:16] have thousands of those missiles from
[55:18] what i understand
[55:20] amen and you they might think you know
[55:22] well we'll get them we'll stop
[55:23] out in arizona where all those silos all
[55:25] we'll drop one right in there and stop
[55:27] no
[55:27] we've got to be submarines and we can
[55:29] sneak right up to that border and send
[55:31] it
[55:32] they've got the same they got submarines
[55:35] you know so you know it's it's just
[55:36] waiting for that time
[55:38] brother talked about how that man always
[55:40] destroys himself the first bite that he
[55:42] ever took off the tree of knowledge
[55:45] amen it got us into this place that we
[55:47] are
[55:48] now it brought death upon all of
[55:50] humanity when eve took of the bite of
[55:52] that knowledge isn't that right
[55:54] every single time that they take a bite
[55:57] off of knowledge he says they
[55:58] invented the gun powder then they killed
[56:00] a lot of people and then they invented
[56:02] the machine gun they killed a lot of
[56:03] people they invented the
[56:04] automobile they took another knowledge
[56:07] and it he says kills more people than
[56:09] all the wars put together
[56:11] and that right every time that people
[56:14] rely on
[56:15] take a bite out of that knowledge it
[56:17] automatically destroys man
[56:19] and then he says now they've got nuclear
[56:20] weapons they've got power
[56:22] amen they have adam bomb and so forth i
[56:24] wonder what they'll do with that
[56:27] amen i believe that man as a whole
[56:31] like i said he is self-destructive amen
[56:36] you let man just it all it only goes to
[56:39] show
[56:40] that man was not meant to lead himself
[56:45] how many believe that how many needs of
[56:47] leadership of the holy ghost in your
[56:49] life
[56:50] amen now i want to read
[56:53] noah the days of noah we want to go back
[56:55] here now and pick up a few thoughts here
[56:57] with the help of the lord
[57:00] all right
[57:06] so i never finished that quote he says
[57:08] you know he says and god cannot send
[57:10] destruction before the
[57:12] people are in the spirit of destruction
[57:15] god never did destroy anything man
[57:18] always destroys himself
[57:21] amen he always destroys himself
[57:24] all right brings it to a place to where
[57:29] you know and if you remember brother bam
[57:31] says you know they'll still send those
[57:33] missiles up there one day and it'll be a
[57:34] mixture of
[57:36] nuclear power and a holy fire
[57:39] god's own power and it'll clean this
[57:41] thing up isn't that right
[57:43] over in janus if you will genesis 6
[57:45] let's read the instant
[57:47] of the days of noah because jesus said
[57:49] like it was there
[57:50] that's what it's going to be like here
[57:53] amen before the lord returns
[57:56] so genesis
[58:11] six and verse one and it came to pass
[58:14] when men began to multiply upon the face
[58:17] of the earth and daughters
[58:19] were born unto them that the sons of god
[58:22] saw the daughters of men that they were
[58:24] fair
[58:24] and it took them wives of all that they
[58:27] chose
[58:28] the lord said my spirit shall not always
[58:32] strive with man
[58:33] for that he also is flesh yet his days
[58:36] shall be 120.
[58:40] wow wow that's quite something in it
[58:44] that just comes to me right now you know
[58:46] we don't know the day or the hour but
[58:48] they knew the day in the hour they said
[58:49] it's going to be 120 years
[58:53] huh he gave him a time he says i'm going
[58:55] to give you 120 years
[58:58] all right so he says shall be 120 years
[59:01] and there were giants in the earth in
[59:03] those days
[59:04] and also after that when the sons of god
[59:07] came in unto the daughters of men and
[59:10] they bear children to them
[59:12] the same became mighty men which were of
[59:14] old men of renown
[59:16] and god saw the wickedness of man that
[59:19] it was great
[59:20] in the earth and that every imagination
[59:22] of the thoughts of his heart was
[59:24] only evil continually
[59:27] and it repented the lord that he had
[59:29] made man on the earth and it grieved him
[59:32] at his heart all right i'm going to stop
[59:34] there
[59:35] because he says he's going to destroy a
[59:36] man and so forth and go back to the
[59:38] first verse one thing that brother bam
[59:40] said when he preached his message of
[59:41] flashing red light
[59:44] excuse me he said the first
[59:49] first sign the first thing he said that
[59:52] shows you
[59:53] that something's fixed will take place
[59:55] it's the multiplication of people
[59:57] and he goes to talking about look he was
[59:59] back then he said look at how people
[1:00:01] have multiplied
[1:00:03] and places that used to be pawns and
[1:00:06] creeks and so forth in our
[1:00:07] cities and subdivisions and all that men
[1:00:10] begin to multiply upon the earth
[1:00:13] and but i'll tell you what how many
[1:00:14] knows that you all you gotta do is go on
[1:00:16] a little trip
[1:00:17] and you'll realize how how how
[1:00:20] absolutely
[1:00:21] full the highways are getting how many
[1:00:23] knows if you don't have patience you are
[1:00:25] in a lot of trouble if you're going on a
[1:00:27] trip
[1:00:28] you better have patience because you're
[1:00:30] gonna you know but you used to take you
[1:00:32] so many hours now you better figure
[1:00:34] two three hours more because you're
[1:00:36] gonna get in traffic jams
[1:00:38] amen and so it's just multiply people
[1:00:40] upon people when you get
[1:00:42] a lot of people together and then most
[1:00:44] of the time you get sin to multiply also
[1:00:47] but he talked about the multiplication
[1:00:50] of people people
[1:00:51] and the population growing and certainly
[1:00:52] we have an all-time high of population
[1:00:55] everywhere
[1:00:57] that's why again i say that when uh you
[1:00:59] know brother bam talking about a handful
[1:01:01] perhaps making the rapture
[1:01:03] maybe a couple dozen we don't know just
[1:01:05] how many but it'll just be a
[1:01:07] few few there be that find it he said
[1:01:10] there'll be just a few
[1:01:11] so the vast majority 95 percent
[1:01:15] if that if he was to say five percent
[1:01:17] would go i mean that'd be a lot of
[1:01:19] people
[1:01:20] amen and you look at 95 percent of the
[1:01:22] people all
[1:01:23] going to be destroyed kind of hard to
[1:01:26] imagine isn't it
[1:01:28] amen and you know the thing of it is the
[1:01:30] thing of it is
[1:01:32] just like it was in the days of noah is
[1:01:34] exactly what i'm doing this morning
[1:01:36] doing the very same
[1:01:38] thing that noah did before the flood
[1:01:40] came and that is to warn the people
[1:01:43] i mean it means it's happening just like
[1:01:45] it did back then
[1:01:46] and they don't think it's not going to
[1:01:49] happen to me
[1:01:51] that's why you're a real genuine
[1:01:52] christian full of the holy ghost you do
[1:01:54] think it's not gonna happen to me
[1:01:56] because i'm not gonna let it happen to
[1:01:58] me because i want to serve the lord with
[1:02:00] all of my heart i'm gonna do whatever it
[1:02:01] takes to be ready that's what a
[1:02:03] christian thinks but another slothful
[1:02:05] type of person they think
[1:02:07] that it isn't going to happen they live
[1:02:08] on the slothful life
[1:02:10] amen and just a lukewarm life isn't that
[1:02:12] right
[1:02:13] and guess what they don't know it and
[1:02:15] they don't really realize it until it
[1:02:17] comes
[1:02:18] upon them naturally believe as you do
[1:02:22] also that these things are coming
[1:02:23] upon us the time
[1:02:26] is drawing i the time
[1:02:30] has come the time is coming it is
[1:02:33] drawing really close
[1:02:35] every single year that goes by that
[1:02:38] generation that jesus
[1:02:39] promised would not pass gets older amen
[1:02:43] gets closer every time amen
[1:02:48] but if you'll notice here then he says
[1:02:49] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[1:02:51] that they were fair brother bam says you
[1:02:53] ain't never seen
[1:02:54] so many pretty women as you have
[1:02:56] nowadays
[1:02:57] amen if they do it you can take an ugly
[1:03:00] woman and you can grab me a big old
[1:03:01] paint bucket and
[1:03:02] hey man you can begin to paint on her
[1:03:04] face and when they get done she looks
[1:03:06] like a
[1:03:08] you know a star
[1:03:12] that's absolutely the truth that can
[1:03:14] paint you up that's why brother baby
[1:03:15] says they got max factor they got all of
[1:03:17] that
[1:03:18] amen they can sure make them look good
[1:03:19] but you wash that stuff off and you're
[1:03:21] going to wake up and you're going to be
[1:03:22] scared
[1:03:27] i didn't know it looked like that hey
[1:03:30] the devil and but you know
[1:03:31] even that even that we realize that
[1:03:33] butterbaum says just naturally speaking
[1:03:36] there truly is a lot more prettier women
[1:03:39] than what there was back then
[1:03:40] pearl o'brien in comparison he says you
[1:03:42] take any normal high school
[1:03:44] girl and then she's a lot prettier than
[1:03:46] she is
[1:03:47] and we're living in an age when the sons
[1:03:50] of god notice brethren since the sons of
[1:03:52] god saw the daughters of men that they
[1:03:54] were pretty
[1:03:55] and how didn't how many knows but abram
[1:03:57] says that a pretty woman
[1:03:59] amen is a bigger trap than all the
[1:04:01] bootleg joints that there is
[1:04:04] it's a bigger snare amen if the devil
[1:04:07] uses them
[1:04:08] it is his number one tool to get the
[1:04:12] sons of god to fall
[1:04:17] amen and god help us man god never but
[1:04:20] about says that god never did forgive
[1:04:22] him for
[1:04:32] oh my lord help us but that's the age
[1:04:34] we're living in isn't that right
[1:04:36] that the devil is using that in such a
[1:04:38] great magnitude
[1:04:40] amen he has yes man i'll tell you what
[1:04:42] you can't go to walmart you can't go
[1:04:44] anywhere anymore
[1:04:45] hardly without having to face it
[1:04:48] amen i'll tell you what this stuff that
[1:04:50] they have on the internet and everything
[1:04:52] all of that that should never
[1:04:54] be legal never be legal why it only
[1:04:58] destroys
[1:05:00] good people that's what it does
[1:05:03] amen but that's another thing the beauty
[1:05:05] of women brother bam says is the sign
[1:05:07] amen of the end times and then marriage
[1:05:10] the other thing he said another sign was
[1:05:12] marriage and divorce people are marrying
[1:05:14] and given in marriage he said they're
[1:05:16] taken unto themselves wives they're not
[1:05:19] even getting married to them having
[1:05:20] children behind them everything
[1:05:22] else amen
[1:05:26] so debates divorce rate he says look at
[1:05:28] the divorce rate
[1:05:29] amen and people amen uh you know not
[1:05:32] being faithful to their wives and so
[1:05:33] forth he had to have a great increase in
[1:05:35] that and that also shows that
[1:05:37] we're living close to the end honey
[1:05:41] believes god has to absolutely all these
[1:05:43] things have to be recompensed all of
[1:05:45] these things have to be paid for
[1:05:48] amen you can't sin and get by
[1:05:51] you can't do wrong and not expect to
[1:05:53] have to pay for it and that's what the
[1:05:54] world is doing
[1:05:56] praise the lord i was thinking back
[1:05:58] there and how that brother bab says that
[1:05:59] when even when the prophet comes on the
[1:06:01] scene
[1:06:02] it is a jaw a sign that judgment
[1:06:06] is about to happen when god sends a
[1:06:09] prophet
[1:06:10] know this that judgment is fixing to
[1:06:13] happen
[1:06:15] he says it's always so sad that god will
[1:06:18] send a prophet
[1:06:19] and just but just the elected catch it
[1:06:23] i thought how sad that is that you think
[1:06:26] about just a small group of all of
[1:06:28] humanity
[1:06:29] amen that actually catch amen god
[1:06:32] speaking through that
[1:06:33] the rest of them don't even know it they
[1:06:35] don't even believe it they go on into
[1:06:37] chaos
[1:06:38] amen hearing a prophet knowing that god
[1:06:41] sent us a prophet
[1:06:42] it tells you that i am the son of god i
[1:06:44] am the daughter of god i know who i
[1:06:46] am i know where i come from and i know
[1:06:49] where i'm going
[1:06:50] and that is so good to know because all
[1:06:53] those that don't catch the prophet
[1:06:55] amen that they don't catch that sign
[1:06:57] everybody doesn't they
[1:06:58] all begin to think that they come from
[1:07:00] monkeys
[1:07:03] i don't know about you but i would
[1:07:04] really not be too happy
[1:07:06] amen living in a world where you think
[1:07:08] you come from a monkey
[1:07:19] is your forefather huh i don't know
[1:07:22] about you but they're acting like a
[1:07:24] bunch of monkeys
[1:07:25] how many knows that i read the other day
[1:07:28] where brown i'll forget exactly what he
[1:07:30] said but something to the extent that
[1:07:31] one day
[1:07:32] when they took prayer out of school
[1:07:35] amen it was a big victory for the devil
[1:07:38] and that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:07:41] would they take bible to take with all
[1:07:43] of these things out of school
[1:07:46] amen it was a victory with some devil
[1:07:49] coming in
[1:07:50] coming in coming in coming in how many
[1:07:53] believe that
[1:07:54] everything that you're seeing is a swamp
[1:07:56] amen it's the swamp of the devil coming
[1:07:58] in like a flood
[1:08:02] it's coming in like a flood and i'll
[1:08:05] tell you what there ain't
[1:08:06] no political there ain't no trump there
[1:08:08] ain't nobody never gonna stop it
[1:08:12] no no they're just small little players
[1:08:15] in this scene
[1:08:16] because god sets up who he wants to and
[1:08:18] he brings down who he wants to
[1:08:20] amen god said he's in control of all
[1:08:23] that
[1:08:24] praise be to god it isn't going to stop
[1:08:28] this flood it isn't going to stop this
[1:08:30] wave that's coming
[1:08:31] in i'm just so grateful you ought to be
[1:08:35] the happiest person in the earth
[1:08:37] to know that you're not part of that
[1:08:38] flood but you're part
[1:08:40] of the standard that god raises up
[1:08:42] against it
[1:08:46] praise be to god another sign of the end
[1:08:49] time according to
[1:08:50] revelation 3 in around 20 says and they
[1:08:53] will be blind
[1:08:54] and naked and wretched and not know it
[1:08:58] amen brother bam says after discernment
[1:09:00] and so forth he says you know
[1:09:02] people will absolutely call it mental
[1:09:04] empathy amen
[1:09:05] people that are christians pentecostals
[1:09:08] and people
[1:09:08] who have had 2 000 years of experience
[1:09:11] of what they should know what the lord
[1:09:14] is
[1:09:14] and there it comes right in front of
[1:09:16] them and then they see it with their
[1:09:18] eyes
[1:09:18] they hear it with their ears and then
[1:09:20] they absolutely reject it he says
[1:09:22] there's
[1:09:23] no wonder damnation is in front of us
[1:09:27] no wonder doom is in front of us because
[1:09:29] people are so blind
[1:09:32] amen the blindness of people amen is a
[1:09:36] sign of the time
[1:09:41] they shall be blind huh the blindness of
[1:09:44] the people
[1:09:46] there's another big sign so blind but
[1:09:48] baby says dear willfully blind
[1:09:56] let me think just think about it what if
[1:09:57] brother branham was up here
[1:09:59] amen we know that god honors his prayers
[1:10:03] that's one thing we gotta all admit
[1:10:05] that's what i want brother bran and
[1:10:07] praying for me
[1:10:08] because god honors his prayers
[1:10:11] amen and when
[1:10:14] he'd be here now and preaching to us
[1:10:16] same message
[1:10:18] amen think of think of the kind of
[1:10:22] people
[1:10:23] we would be perhaps huh
[1:10:26] if any of us is lukewarm
[1:10:30] and we see the signs we see the
[1:10:32] discernments we see people getting
[1:10:33] healed and so forth
[1:10:37] how many would say i wouldn't be the
[1:10:39] person that i am don't have to raise
[1:10:40] your hand
[1:10:41] because i'm fixing to tell you something
[1:10:44] think about it well i'd be different
[1:10:46] than you ain't then you ain't what you
[1:10:48] ought to be
[1:10:50] because i don't have to see it again i
[1:10:51] already heard it i believe it anyway i
[1:10:53] know it's true
[1:10:54] i believe god just as much this morning
[1:10:56] i believe that if
[1:10:58] brother paul was here if god was doing
[1:11:00] it through his prophet
[1:11:01] i believe that message just as much i'd
[1:11:03] be out there
[1:11:04] i'd be saying amen preach it brother
[1:11:07] let him preach it i believe it that
[1:11:09] ain't nothing but the truth
[1:11:12] huh amen but that's what i'm saying amen
[1:11:15] it ought to be just as real to every
[1:11:17] last one of us
[1:11:18] that god amen has spoken in this
[1:11:21] generation
[1:11:24] praise the lord it's still the same
[1:11:28] i don't have to i god already came and
[1:11:30] he already showed the sign
[1:11:32] praise the lord how many knows he was
[1:11:34] assigned like as it was in the days of
[1:11:36] lot
[1:11:36] and then we've had the same sign of this
[1:11:38] generation
[1:11:40] oh but it says like like like with
[1:11:44] solomon
[1:11:44] he says man what if everybody what if
[1:11:47] everybody would accept the gift that god
[1:11:49] has sent to this generation
[1:11:51] you would have a millennium you would
[1:11:54] have a golden age like they did with
[1:11:57] solomon
[1:12:01] what a golden age what a golden age you
[1:12:05] would be but when people reject it
[1:12:07] there's nothing left but damnation
[1:12:10] and that's what the church world did
[1:12:12] that's why we're in a condition that
[1:12:14] we're in
[1:12:14] it's because the church world hello
[1:12:18] the moon packed out the sun like they
[1:12:21] put him out
[1:12:23] that's why the conditions are they are
[1:12:24] in
[1:12:27] amen but it was meant to be he was
[1:12:29] supposed to be
[1:12:30] god knew it would be that way because
[1:12:32] man they can see things with their eyes
[1:12:35] huh
[1:12:37] they can hear with their ears and they
[1:12:40] still say no
[1:12:41] my church don't teach that
[1:12:45] my church don't teach that
[1:12:49] you willfully blind yourself
[1:12:53] i don't want to hear it no more all that
[1:12:56] preachers on the back road but the man
[1:12:57] began to say
[1:12:58] you know that angel came to me and he
[1:13:00] says don't drink or smoke
[1:13:03] oh there they go he said he couldn't
[1:13:06] even finish his testimony like paul did
[1:13:09] i was struck down on the road to
[1:13:11] damascus and here i am to say like paul
[1:13:13] that god did something for me
[1:13:15] god told me not to do this out of the
[1:13:16] other forever work for
[1:13:19] see y'all you don't want to hear about
[1:13:21] the work huh
[1:13:23] but you want to give god you want god to
[1:13:25] give you entrance when you get over
[1:13:26] there huh
[1:13:27] i don't think that's going to happen no
[1:13:32] willfully talked were turned away and
[1:13:34] then at the end of it all prophet of god
[1:13:36] didn't barely have a place to go
[1:13:38] just like jesus didn't barely have a
[1:13:40] place to go they crucified him
[1:13:43] or the end of jesus ministry was
[1:13:46] terrible
[1:13:47] according to man even all of his
[1:13:50] disciples scattered and left him
[1:13:53] hid themselves left they took him up and
[1:13:56] killed him and them
[1:13:57] disciples were absolutely in agony
[1:14:00] thinking their whole thing had fallen
[1:14:02] apart
[1:14:03] but they hadn't caught the vision amen
[1:14:07] and he says
[1:14:08] destroy this temple and in three days
[1:14:12] i'll raise it back up
[1:14:14] [Laughter]
[1:14:17] who raised god up who raised jesus up
[1:14:20] god right
[1:14:21] and jesus said if i remember right my
[1:14:23] scripture says
[1:14:24] he don't say my father raised me up he
[1:14:26] says in the eye
[1:14:27] we'll raise it up made himself god
[1:14:31] because he was nonetheless amen
[1:14:34] and i will raise it up again but the
[1:14:37] blindness let me bring you that up the
[1:14:39] blindness of people
[1:14:41] shows the hour that we're living and
[1:14:43] people will be
[1:14:44] absolutely blind and what else goes
[1:14:46] along with this blindness
[1:14:48] what causes people what causes you
[1:14:51] what causes me to become lukewarm
[1:14:54] and blind it's the lukewarmness that you
[1:14:57] get
[1:14:58] people get lukewarm not hot for god
[1:15:01] and i'll tell you the second you don't
[1:15:03] have your prayer life like you ought to
[1:15:05] your eyes begin to dim up they begin to
[1:15:08] fog over and you begin to think your
[1:15:10] bank account's more important than
[1:15:12] churches

[1:16:55] chapter is exercised
[1:16:56] all the power of the first beast
[1:17:00] amen that's right it'll take that
[1:17:04] because this is how terrible this world
[1:17:06] is getting
[1:17:07] shall we go on a little further here
[1:17:09] janice again
[1:17:10] so it says here
[1:17:15] god saw the wickedness of man that it
[1:17:17] was constantly
[1:17:18] evil isn't that bad what
[1:17:22] it is all people think about
[1:17:26] they don't never really think about
[1:17:27] their their god that made it they don't
[1:17:30] think about holiness or right
[1:17:31] everything's always
[1:17:32] evil i always got their minds on evil
[1:17:35] things
[1:17:36] constantly evil constantly wicked we can
[1:17:39] look at the multiplication and the
[1:17:41] constant
[1:17:42] wickedness in the world
[1:17:46] and i'm here to tell you god is long
[1:17:48] suffering
[1:17:51] how many knows in the days of noah he
[1:17:54] let them people get so bad
[1:17:55] he let solomon saddam and gamora
[1:17:59] get so bad that if you as a man
[1:18:02] that was not a homosexual they would
[1:18:04] come after you
[1:18:06] and they try to make you a homosexual
[1:18:09] i mean as a homosexual agenda is very
[1:18:11] they're very much
[1:18:13] uh into promoting their colors
[1:18:17] i don't know you teachers might know but
[1:18:19] uh teaching some kind of an alternative
[1:18:22] lifestyle in school
[1:18:24] is that what that's all about if it is
[1:18:26] it ain't nothing but the lowest bunch of
[1:18:29] mess you ever saw in your life
[1:18:31] alternative
[1:18:33] they can teach theirs but we can't teach
[1:18:35] the bible and righteousness and holiness
[1:18:37] that'll make good people out of people
[1:18:40] huh
[1:18:43] i i you know now just this is a little
[1:18:46] political
[1:18:48] but i read a quote where brother brown
[1:18:49] says now they're trying to pass in
[1:18:51] congress
[1:18:51] to where you can't shout sing in church
[1:18:54] you can't shout
[1:18:56] they want to outlaw it in congress that
[1:18:58] you can't shout in church
[1:19:00] and i thought well that ain't so much
[1:19:01] different than our people telling hey
[1:19:03] you can't sing in church
[1:19:07] if i'm good enough to go to church i'm
[1:19:10] good enough to see it
[1:19:14] come on come on folks can i get a little
[1:19:16] amen
[1:19:18] it's all right amen they won't let him
[1:19:20] go to church but not sing amen
[1:19:22] you know the very next step is don't go
[1:19:24] to church
[1:19:25] now they pushed that pretty hard but
[1:19:27] they got a lot of pushback on that
[1:19:29] huh people gonna go to church even
[1:19:31] though the one church is gonna have to
[1:19:32] be fine
[1:19:33] 20 000 for going to church
[1:19:37] hey i don't mind going to jail for going
[1:19:39] to church
[1:19:41] amen i don't
[1:19:45] now y'all know who i stand i don't
[1:19:46] believe in i believe in the middle of
[1:19:48] the road
[1:19:49] huh i've tried to practice the middle of
[1:19:50] the road with all of this i think we
[1:19:52] should be careful that's common sense
[1:19:53] isn't that right
[1:19:54] but still amen to tell us we can't sing
[1:19:58] i'm like wow but i just
[1:20:01] like i've seen that i said i didn't know
[1:20:03] brother brown had actually said that but
[1:20:04] yes he's they said they want to
[1:20:05] outlaw this screaming and shouting and
[1:20:08] singing and stuff you know they don't
[1:20:09] want none of that around
[1:20:11] why because they're lukewarm but they
[1:20:13] don't want to have any of that
[1:20:15] amen how many knows when they get over
[1:20:18] yesterday well they're not gonna but
[1:20:19] anyway
[1:20:20] if they didn't get overhanded it'd be an
[1:20:22] awful terrible uncomfortable place
[1:20:25] praise the lord let me go on so now
[1:20:27] noticing god saw the wickedness of man
[1:20:29] that it was great upon the earth
[1:20:31] and that every imagination of his
[1:20:32] thought and his of his heart was
[1:20:34] only evil continually and it repented
[1:20:38] the lord that he had made man on earth
[1:20:39] and it grieved him at his heart
[1:20:44] amen and the lord said i will destroy
[1:20:47] man whom i have created from the face of
[1:20:49] the earth
[1:20:50] both man and beast and creepy thing the
[1:20:53] fowls of the air
[1:20:55] for it repenteth me that i have made
[1:20:58] them
[1:21:01] how many knows god has feelings
[1:21:05] i heard about what i'm saying the other
[1:21:07] day in foreign fields some of those
[1:21:08] people would
[1:21:09] run through their the guards and
[1:21:11] everything and just dive through him and
[1:21:13] and try to get to the altar and try to
[1:21:15] get paid for and he says you know and
[1:21:17] you can't have that
[1:21:18] i hope you can't have that because if
[1:21:20] you've got chaos
[1:21:22] the holy spirit is not in chaos
[1:21:25] how many knows the devil dwells in chaos
[1:21:28] his brother says god is sensitive you
[1:21:31] have to
[1:21:32] have things done decently and in order
[1:21:37] god is sensitive he had some feelings
[1:21:39] and he was repentant
[1:21:42] at his heart god was like why did i even
[1:21:45] make man
[1:21:49] amen let me just make a statement
[1:21:53] man without the holy ghost left to
[1:21:55] himself always
[1:21:57] goes to the
[1:22:00] worst of evil
[1:22:04] amen just like hitler
[1:22:08] i might make a statement that without
[1:22:10] the holy ghost
[1:22:11] if you wasted under the right conditions
[1:22:13] you would probably be a hitler too
[1:22:15] you'd say you'd never do that don't
[1:22:17] underestimate the power
[1:22:19] of the evil that is in the heart when
[1:22:21] the holy spirit isn't there to control
[1:22:23] you
[1:22:25] to guide you to lead you amen
[1:22:28] i'm thankful for the holy spirit
[1:22:30] leadership i thank god
[1:22:32] for his leadership
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:38] now before i go to my ending thought i
[1:22:41] want to go to a couple more scriptures
[1:22:43] would that be all right
[1:22:45] let's go to ii timothy if you would
[1:22:54] how many believes that even in today's
[1:22:56] world there's a
[1:22:58] great falling away even amongst message
[1:23:01] people there is a
[1:23:02] falling away
[1:23:05] brother banham in his time the holy
[1:23:08] spirit quickened to him one time and
[1:23:10] showed him
[1:23:11] the reason why there was people that was
[1:23:14] going out and
[1:23:15] claiming they had blood coming out of
[1:23:17] their hands and there was healing in it
[1:23:18] and
[1:23:19] oils and these different gimmicks you
[1:23:21] know
[1:23:23] and the holy spirit took in the second
[1:23:26] tim
[1:23:26] or first timothy i'm sorry first timothy
[1:23:28] 4
[1:23:30] he says now the spirit ex
[1:23:33] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[1:23:36] times
[1:23:38] some shall depart from the faith giving
[1:23:41] heed to seducing spirits
[1:23:44] and doctrines of devils speaking lies in
[1:23:49] hypocrisy
[1:23:50] having their conscience seared with a
[1:23:52] hot iron
[1:23:53] brother bam says they'll leave all right
[1:23:57] the faith and give heed to seducing
[1:24:00] spirits
[1:24:01] and doctrines of devils and that people
[1:24:04] would
[1:24:05] not endure sound doctrine anymore
[1:24:08] but they would heap to themselves
[1:24:11] teachers
[1:24:12] having itching ears isn't that right
[1:24:15] so we're living in our brothers and
[1:24:17] sisters that whenever you're on the
[1:24:19] right path whenever you're doing what
[1:24:21] god wants you to do
[1:24:22] remember any spirit because it was a
[1:24:25] very same spirit that
[1:24:26] seduced eve amen seduced her
[1:24:30] and that same spirit seduces people to
[1:24:33] shake them from their own steadfastness
[1:24:36] from their
[1:24:37] what brother brandon called a rugged
[1:24:40] everyday
[1:24:40] simple humble christian life how many
[1:24:44] believe is that what we need in every
[1:24:45] one of our lives
[1:24:46] you need to have a life that is simple
[1:24:48] that's humble
[1:24:49] that is a christian daily life
[1:24:53] amen people are not happy with stone
[1:24:56] doctrine in other words i heard that
[1:25:00] doctrine before and they get
[1:25:01] it gets old to people and they have
[1:25:04] itching ears and people want to hear
[1:25:06] something different they want something
[1:25:08] new
[1:25:10] and it gives the devil an opportunity to
[1:25:12] come in there
[1:25:13] amen and to seduce them and then to
[1:25:16] entice them
[1:25:17] to go in a different direction
[1:25:20] how many believes you got to watch that
[1:25:22] you got to watch spirits
[1:25:24] that seduce the people amen to
[1:25:27] you know they're just they're not
[1:25:29] satisfied with the old-time religion
[1:25:33] the old-time doctrines and they wanted
[1:25:36] something new and they ended up taking
[1:25:38] doctrines of devils
[1:25:39] just like in brother banham time let me
[1:25:41] tell you it was those things
[1:25:42] that they had but says you know those
[1:25:44] are not scriptural
[1:25:46] and anything that isn't scriptural
[1:25:47] scares me
[1:25:49] it ain't right it'll not come out right
[1:25:52] you're out on a limb and people that
[1:25:53] fall for that stuff
[1:25:55] amen are going to end up out there on
[1:25:57] the limb somewhere
[1:25:59] seduced by evil spirits to get you to
[1:26:02] fall from your own steadfastness
[1:26:06] amen praise be to god
[1:26:09] people are and there's notice let me go
[1:26:13] to another one real quick
[1:26:14] the other thing is in ii timothy
[1:26:17] ii timothy 3 i want you to know that it
[1:26:20] says that in the last days
[1:26:22] perilous times shall come for people
[1:26:25] will be
[1:26:26] lovers of their own selves
[1:26:30] amen people are going to be very selfish
[1:26:34] in this last hour
[1:26:39] oh my how many knows everyone wants
[1:26:42] their rights
[1:26:45] everybody wants equal rights
[1:26:50] god never did give the man and the woman
[1:26:52] equal rights
[1:26:55] huh brother braham says the biggest fake
[1:26:58] they ever made was then they let woman
[1:26:59] vote
[1:27:02] i don't know how you women feel about
[1:27:03] that but he never agreed with it
[1:27:06] i don't know why but you know this is
[1:27:08] how it is
[1:27:11] and another thing the bible says
[1:27:14] and he shall be equal with you
[1:27:19] no and he shall rule overly how many
[1:27:22] believes that a
[1:27:22] husband is the ruler of a woman of a
[1:27:25] wife
[1:27:29] how many seen the twins the two girls
[1:27:31] with two heads
[1:27:33] oh i have seen that there's a there's a
[1:27:36] good one girl
[1:27:37] one body has two heads yeah
[1:27:41] that's got to be a terrible way to live
[1:27:42] isn't that right that's the same way
[1:27:45] with the marriage or anything
[1:27:46] else that has two heads i want to go
[1:27:48] this way now i want to go that way
[1:27:49] somebody's got to decide which way we're
[1:27:50] going
[1:27:52] god didn't created them equal they were
[1:27:54] equal before the fall
[1:27:56] but brotherhood says afterwards she's
[1:27:58] not even allowed in the pulpit
[1:28:00] he's not to speak the word of god she's
[1:28:01] to be in silence
[1:28:04] follow her husband how many times easier
[1:28:07] she deceived than a man
[1:28:09] a thousand times easier deceived than
[1:28:11] the man
[1:28:15] i don't know this just comes to mind
[1:28:18] but you can convince a woman you must be
[1:28:20] able to convince a woman
[1:28:21] easier than the man huh
[1:28:25] women are easily convinced a lot of
[1:28:28] times that's a real downfall for young
[1:28:30] girls
[1:28:31] hello a little some boy come in there
[1:28:34] smarter than she is and hey he can talk
[1:28:35] to her a little bit lead her astray real
[1:28:37] quick
[1:28:39] amen that's why she needs a daddy hey
[1:28:42] man to get a stick and chase a boy off
[1:28:44] say get out of here son i'm watching
[1:28:46] over my girl
[1:28:48] huh that's right that's why that's why
[1:28:51] it's
[1:28:52] it's not god didn't make it that way and
[1:28:53] when you try to make it that way you
[1:28:55] have what
[1:28:56] chaos amen
[1:29:00] but people are selfish they're not
[1:29:02] willing to forfeit their rights
[1:29:04] amen same way with a pastor he has to be
[1:29:07] in submission
[1:29:09] he has to be subject to the word of god
[1:29:12] if he is and he ain't fit to be here
[1:29:15] everybody's supposed to be under
[1:29:17] authority
[1:29:19] that somebody the head of the woman is a
[1:29:21] man at the head of the man is christ
[1:29:24] amen and i'll tell you what if you don't
[1:29:26] want if you want chaos in this church
[1:29:29] let me come un-subject to christ teach
[1:29:32] my own thing
[1:29:34] it won't be long i'll be saying brother
[1:29:36] bran is a false prophet we need to go a
[1:29:37] different way
[1:29:41] that's exactly right they don't take the
[1:29:42] leadership of god they want to take
[1:29:44] their own leadership
[1:29:45] why because they have lifted themselves
[1:29:47] up to a place to where they thought
[1:29:49] that they knew more about it than a
[1:29:50] vindicated proven prophet of god
[1:29:52] they thought of themselves too highly
[1:29:56] amen no you're not above the prophet
[1:29:59] there ain't no pastor or anybody above a
[1:30:01] prophet
[1:30:03] amen i ain't got a right to my own
[1:30:05] thinking
[1:30:06] i want to think his thoughts i mean
[1:30:08] believes that we're a prisoner to christ
[1:30:10] this world needs a whole lot more
[1:30:12] realizing that we need to get rid
[1:30:14] of our rights forfeit our rights
[1:30:19] amen praise the lord
[1:30:24] perilous times will come when people
[1:30:26] love themselves more than anything else
[1:30:33] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:30:37] and disobedient to parents how many
[1:30:40] knows most of our problems today is
[1:30:41] because of our disobedience
[1:30:43] to parents
[1:30:47] their parents didn't give them a weapon
[1:30:50] they didn't correct them that's why they
[1:30:52] are like they are today
[1:30:55] you want chaos in your house don't
[1:30:57] correct your children
[1:31:00] junior i told you to quit that
[1:31:04] huh i'd like to smack you for talking to
[1:31:07] junior like that
[1:31:09] you know why because if you as any kind
[1:31:11] of a teacher you'd have to say
[1:31:14] junior
[1:31:16] junior he'd know to look
[1:31:19] he'd go go do it quick he knows look
[1:31:22] you never had to raise your voice but
[1:31:25] you think by screaming it'll get it done
[1:31:27] no a good rod
[1:31:31] makes you be able to talk quiet
[1:31:34] just to look and all right just look he
[1:31:37] knows that look
[1:31:41] that's how it ought to be amen

[1:33:56] what you was doing
[1:33:58] you're trying to save my life you're
[1:34:01] trying to save
[1:34:02] my soul amen bible says something about
[1:34:05] when you
[1:34:05] correct him he says you save their soul
[1:34:07] we had a
[1:34:09] five gallon bucket two five gallon
[1:34:11] bucket paint sticks
[1:34:13] taped together that's what we had and we
[1:34:16] had on there
[1:34:17] the soul saver we wrote on there the
[1:34:19] soul saver
[1:34:22] i had in the church the morning so
[1:34:24] praise the lord
[1:34:27] the soul savior you know because you're
[1:34:29] not taught to do right folks
[1:34:32] the cha it's terrible the child doesn't
[1:34:34] know when you're going to go off when
[1:34:36] you're not
[1:34:37] he don't know what you're going to do
[1:34:39] you might clobber him over the head one
[1:34:41] time and just
[1:34:42] by half kill him and the next time you
[1:34:43] don't do nothing he don't know what to
[1:34:45] expect
[1:34:46] hey i might be able to get away with it
[1:34:47] this time he didn't hit me last time
[1:34:49] but if it's consistent he knows exactly
[1:34:51] where he is and he's happy
[1:34:54] he can run and jump and scream and not
[1:34:56] quite jump on the couch so much because
[1:34:58] he knows that's off limits right you
[1:34:59] know just where the barriers are
[1:35:02] and it makes for happier children we'd
[1:35:04] be in a happier world
[1:35:06] if they'd have kept the rod in church i
[1:35:08] mean in school if they had kept the
[1:35:10] bible in school
[1:35:12] if the preachers would have stayed in
[1:35:13] their place and listened to the prophet
[1:35:15] of god and listened to god
[1:35:17] this world would be in a good place we'd
[1:35:19] be practically in a millennium brother
[1:35:22] woody
[1:35:22] if everybody would hurt the prophet of
[1:35:24] god and done what god told them to do
[1:35:28] the good thing about the prophet god is
[1:35:29] he could preach like i and then he say
[1:35:31] all right that's part of the service of
[1:35:32] sober
[1:35:33] now let's see the lord come down and
[1:35:35] vindicate
[1:35:36] the truth amen and they always would
[1:35:39] come
[1:35:41] amen praise be to god how many believes
[1:35:44] we're following a vindicated
[1:35:45] word of god what time i'll be saying
[1:35:49] that delayed all right

[1:35:53] disobedient
[1:35:54] to parents so that's one of the signs
[1:35:58] of the end they're not obedient anymore

[1:36:05] follow isn't it
[1:36:07] very good word no i'm and non-holy
[1:36:11] unthankful unholy without natural
[1:36:14] affection
[1:36:16] truth breakers false accusers
[1:36:19] incontinent fierce boy that's a good
[1:36:23] word for them nowadays and they're just
[1:36:24] plain fears
[1:36:27] despisers of those that are good
[1:36:32] how many knows we're living our
[1:36:34] political system
[1:36:35] we're living in a time now that they're
[1:36:38] calling wrong
[1:36:39] right and they're calling right
[1:36:42] wrong that's exactly what we're at
[1:36:47] everything that's good everything that's
[1:36:49] right they're calling wrong
[1:36:52] and everything that's wrong is a calling
[1:36:55] right
[1:36:56] traitors heady high-minded
[1:37:01] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:37:03] god having a form of godliness but
[1:37:05] denying the power thereof
[1:37:08] from such turn away
[1:37:12] selfishness lovers of their selves we're
[1:37:15] living in a very
[1:37:16] selfish age how many knows to the riots
[1:37:20] that goes on
[1:37:22] that is governed by selfishness
[1:37:25] selfishness
[1:37:29] going to a man's pawn shop and not just
[1:37:34] take everything he has but
[1:37:35] kill him before leaving that's
[1:37:38] selfish offer what people can get
[1:37:42] for what they can get
[1:37:46] we want our rights we want this we want
[1:37:47] that i want this i want that
[1:37:49] it's all selfish
[1:37:53] and it leads to destruction
[1:37:56] my last thing that i want to talk about
[1:38:00] that is violence
[1:38:03] violence in genesis
[1:38:06] because we're how many of those uh i was
[1:38:09] just thinking about we've seen violence
[1:38:11] on a much greater scale than what we
[1:38:15] have seen
[1:38:16] but you take libya muhammad qaddafi that
[1:38:19] they
[1:38:20] ran out and killed uh syria you
[1:38:23] take uh just about any of those eastern
[1:38:26] countries we know on the east is in a
[1:38:28] great distress has been in great
[1:38:30] distress
[1:38:31] with much much violence violence has
[1:38:33] really been increased
[1:38:36] but we're seeing it not just there and i
[1:38:38] i remember
[1:38:39] and you don't mean to get political i
[1:38:41] would just say trump was talking about
[1:38:43] the iranians and those who were raising
[1:38:45] up
[1:38:46] you know against the government and
[1:38:48] we're behind you and we disagree with
[1:38:49] your government and so forth
[1:38:51] and it was right about at that time that
[1:38:53] this happened over here
[1:38:54] so what could you say you know they have
[1:38:57] their rioters they have their violent
[1:38:59] people
[1:39:00] and then all of a sudden he rose up
[1:39:01] right here and we're seeing it right
[1:39:03] here at home
[1:39:04] now notice so down in uh
[1:39:08] verse chapter six hold on
[1:39:11] my bible's wearing out i need a new one
[1:39:14] i've warned quite a few out i'm still
[1:39:16] looking for a bible that won't fall
[1:39:18] apart on me
[1:39:19] but they just all fall apart i wish i
[1:39:21] had one to say because
[1:39:22] you know how it is you get to you know
[1:39:24] where pitch pay you can go right
[1:39:26] there is what i was looking for and you
[1:39:27] get a new one if it's written any
[1:39:29] different you have to kind of start over
[1:39:31] but chapter 6 of genesis but noah found
[1:39:34] grace
[1:39:35] in the eyes of the lord can somebody say
[1:39:37] amen
[1:39:39] there's a group of people that found
[1:39:40] grace
[1:39:42] in the eyes of the lord in the midst of
[1:39:45] god fixing to destroy it
[1:39:46] there was a group that found grace in
[1:39:50] the eyes of god
[1:39:54] verse 11 the earth also was corrupt
[1:39:59] before garad how many brother brahm says
[1:40:02] if a man goes into politics
[1:40:04] a clean man he'll come out corrupt the
[1:40:07] whole world
[1:40:08] is corrupt he says i don't don't matter
[1:40:09] if you're a republican or democrat it
[1:40:11] hasn't got no
[1:40:12] no one is as bad as the other it's all
[1:40:15] corruption
[1:40:18] before god and the earth was filled with
[1:40:22] what violence
[1:40:25] violence you know we used to have some
[1:40:28] violence we used to have these things
[1:40:30] but
[1:40:31] it's gotten the word almost ongoing all
[1:40:33] the time now
[1:40:34] and you have to wonder how much worse
[1:40:36] it'll get and it's predicted by that
[1:40:38] preacher that we showed up here
[1:40:40] administer that at the end of this year
[1:40:44] that it could get twice as bad
[1:40:47] according to him and you can see how
[1:40:50] that violence
[1:40:51] violence has been increased and god
[1:40:54] looked upon the earth and behold it was
[1:40:56] corrupt and all flesh had corrupted his
[1:40:58] way
[1:40:59] upon the earth remember what brother bam
[1:41:01] says the people are getting in that
[1:41:03] spirit for the destruction because god
[1:41:06] isn't going to destroy it
[1:41:08] god is so full of mercy and so
[1:41:10] long-suffering
[1:41:11] isn't that right that he lets it go to
[1:41:13] where it's just ready to
[1:41:15] explode you know right just ready to
[1:41:18] like brother brahm says it's a putrify's
[1:41:20] ore and one of these days it's just
[1:41:21] gonna bust
[1:41:23] this is gonna get worse and worse and
[1:41:24] worse infection
[1:41:26] until it'll just blow and god has to do
[1:41:28] something
[1:41:30] amen i think
[1:41:32] all of us know that if time tarried when
[1:41:35] the devil comes down himself
[1:41:37] after the bride leaves he says woe to
[1:41:40] the inhabitants
[1:41:41] then woe to the inhabitants of the earth
[1:41:45] in the tribulation period when the holy
[1:41:48] spirit comes up
[1:41:49] that accuser is brought down and the
[1:41:51] pope will not just be the pope and the
[1:41:53] antichrist false prophet
[1:41:54] but he will become the beast amen
[1:41:58] i truly believe that'll be the time that
[1:42:00] you go say a prayer for somebody without
[1:42:02] somebody's permission
[1:42:04] you'll be shot on the spot by the man's
[1:42:06] head
[1:42:07] you'll be hunted down like dogs people
[1:42:10] will have to go into the mountains and
[1:42:11] the caves and hide
[1:42:13] in that right and everything else and
[1:42:15] run for their lives and you will have to
[1:42:17] if you claim to be a christian if you
[1:42:19] want to have any chance of making heaven
[1:42:21] and now you'll have to seal
[1:42:23] your testimony with your blood
[1:42:26] amen you might come up as a foolish
[1:42:28] virgin somewhere or something
[1:42:29] amen but that's what it'll be like
[1:42:33] but violence shall be increased and i
[1:42:36] thought lord
[1:42:37] that's so true isn't it look at the
[1:42:39] violence that has increased
[1:42:41] people can no murder each other
[1:42:46] just murder each other you know it's one
[1:42:48] thing if you want to talk about racist
[1:42:50] somebody else killing you but when you
[1:42:51] go killing your own people
[1:42:53] well he ain't got nothing left there's
[1:42:55] no morality left
[1:42:57] amen the only place there is any kind of
[1:43:00] safety
[1:43:01] any kind of place of refuge is in jesus
[1:43:03] christ
[1:43:04] that's why he says there is no hope left
[1:43:06] for this world outside the coming of the
[1:43:08] lord
[1:43:09] that's why i always like to preach about
[1:43:10] the coming of the lord
[1:43:12] it come anytime it's in season don't you
[1:43:14] believe
[1:43:15] it's time any time now for the lord to

[1:44:25] joy of my life is to see this right here
[1:44:28] that is people coming to the lord and
[1:44:30] giving their lives so that's the
[1:44:32] greatest joy the prophet had was to see
