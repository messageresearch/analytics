uh just wish her happy birthday uh everybody want to turn to hebrews chapter four brother brad you wanna pray um we'll do verses 7 through 16 again he limiteth a certain day saying in david today after so long time as it is said today if you will hear his voice and hard not your hearts they're remaining there for a rest of the people of god let us labor therefore to enter into the rest unless any man fall after the same example of unbelief neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do we have none in high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy amen brother brian morning brothers and sisters i promise not to fall over i if you would come with me to prom verse the 22nd chapter you know there's a lot of nuggets in that fourth chapter of hebrews i would hope all of us are rested in in christ you've ceased from all your labors in a spiritual sense and have found rest in jesus christ this morning you know and people would ask you uh does christ mean more to you this morning than he did yesterday are you closer to him today than you were yesterday guys brother brown i mean brother thomas has been preaching the last couple of sundays and wednesdays you know as this world gets crazier and crazier are you getting closer and closer and closer you know i was just i wrote some notes down this morning but i'll just read a few of these scriptures here in proverbs 22nd chapter i know i say it a lot but you know you could start you got 31 chapters here you could read one of these every day of your life every month of the year in like a you know this four maybe not quite 4 000 years ago and the truths that are in proverbs haven't changed people are still people they're the same no matter where you go if if they're not saved and full of the holy ghost in the presence of christ and the hearts and lives they're going to just be people they're going to do things that people do that doesn't make excuse for bad behavior but they can't help who they are sometimes but let me um read the first couple of these first so if you expect more out of people than you do out of yourself then you're wrong to start with i don't know why i just said that a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor favor rather than silver and gold that's a real important principle the rich and poor meet together and the lord is the maker of them all so you know humility is an important thing for a christian spirit but humility is an important spirit whether you're a christian or not not thinking of yourself more than what you really are in life that's really important because if you go outside of that foundation where you know that you have limitations other people have limitations and that you can meet together you know and common ground you'll never get along with everyone you'll it's just i mean it's the truth of life it goes on to say here a prudent man foreseeth evil and hides as himself but a simple pass on and uh punished you know i look at a statement like that and i it goes on and talks about it the worst thing is for an evil man that knows he should correct someone and lets him die or have a this favor in his father that's even far worse and it goes on to say here humility and the fear of the lord are riches and honor in life that solomon is teaching his children he's teaching us and all the people thousands of years later that everything is based upon a relationship i know i say that a lot but you can't say it enough everything that we are as individuals is based on a relationship and he goes on to say thorns and snares are in the way of the forward he that doeth he that doeth keep his soul shall be far from them and then everyone knows this scripture here train up a child and the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it and the rich rule is over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender and and there's a lot of these christian financial people that's a scripture they they read all the time and it's really true if you know and it goes on to hate he that soweth and his anger shall fail he that hath the bountiful eye shall be blessed for he giveth of his bread to the poor you know that goes again to what i said in the beginning a humble spirit a caring spirit a giving spirit you know i was writing these notes down here what i'll just read what i was thinking here whether you like it or not it's always the same whatever you are as an whether you like it or not you manifest who you really are and in times of trouble or distress the person that comes out is who you really are if you're quick to anger or quick to accuse people of for your own mistakes that's who you really are when trouble comes if you're willing to accept that sometimes bad things happen to good people and move through it then that's more of a christ-like spirit if you're one of those people that has to blame everyone around you for the troubles that you're in then you have to go back and realize that sometimes your own decisions that you make in your life bring about the experiences you'll face later on but i just uh it i wrote down and it has to do with authority and that's what solomon's talking about here whether you like it or not there's always some form of authority that we all face over you whether you accept or accept accepted or not everyone here this morning's under some form of authority but and i'll just write some of those authorities that that we all face every day in our life and how you deal with them and how you represent yourself to people when you these authorities are brought about in your life is testifying who you are and that everyone knows the basic one is children and parents the relationship that children and parents have and fruit when you on the outside look at that relationship you're seeing whether children will accept the authority of their parents and the parents will accept the responsibility of that authority to guide their children as they're growing up and then you have another one and it's our country it's just it's gone i mean this one is the the relationship between the student and his teacher that's totally gone and now today's society too just like parental relationship is gone and how students and teachers interact with each other shows you and it goes back to the parents again have they taught their children right are you expecting your teacher to be the guardian of your children so you can be whoever you want to be and then he goes on he goes in this church this morning it's the same thing as members or as pastor the way you deal with your pastor or the way the pastor deals with you there's authority there there's a relationship there and when what you're representing when you leave the double doors out here how you represented here is a testimony to who you really are and the most important one i've noticed lately is totally out of keter is the relationship we have as citizens to the government and the government has a relationship to us as citizens that's completely broken down and it goes back to what we were reading in hebrews the fourth chapter as as satan out there in the world is breaking down these authorities and these relationships that we have with each other and you go to the last one and it's it i see it every day you all see it too it's a relationship you have as either the worker as the boss the way you interact those are different things that we deal with every day of our life and who you are as a christian is being represented every minute of your life when you're dealing with other people and how you accept authority or reject authority or how you deal with people in these different roles it's a testimony to who you are as a christian this morning and and that's how you you know when sometimes we don't want to hear what people think of us i know it's a hard thing sometimes you gotta sometimes when people are telling you the truth it's a real hard thing to receive and i just wrote down how you respect that authority and how you would deal with it shows your character shows who you are and you know everyone everyone has to have a good self-worth they have to believe that that they're a good per there's nothing wrong with that but you can believe yourself be be a good person and still be a devil at the same time and like i said before everything that we do as individuals is based upon the word of god and how we interact with the word of god in our lives and that shows who you are your children know who you are your workers know who you are your people you deal with outside your neighbors they know who you are you know are you willing to just overlook some people's faults and just let them you know sometimes you don't always have to be right you just have to be loving and forgiving sometimes you don't i don't know what i'm saying but uh i was just reading something also i was listening to on that old ipod i have i just let it recirculates on sometimes unless i lose power but i was going to read i was also thinking i was reading this this book this morning and i'll be i'm all over the place this morning i'll apologize if i seem like that you know if you look at our world that we're in this morning and the way it's going as brother thomas has been saying uh if you're listening to other people preaching online you the presence of the evil evil that's out there in the world it's it doesn't get any better you're surprised every day about what people can imagine and what people can do to each other but then i was thinking you know when you read the bible we forget that the society that paul and peter were living in the roman and greek society it just perverted i mean just like what you see what you're seeing now i say it said this before is no different than greek and roman society that they were dealing with every day the evilness that was in that society it's just crept back into our world right now and it's not going to get any better but it's going to get worse but brother branham was talking i hope i didn't lose my place here this quote here i'll read this is from 1957 april 7th it's uh jesus then jesus came there's several messages that have the same thing i probably lost my place here but yeah it has to deal with your darkest hour here but i think i lost my i think i lost my place here where i was going to read from it i'll just read what i have here it's the 42nd quote now there really was a dark time could you imagine those two beautiful this deals with martha and mary and they lost their brother but i was also thinking you know we live in a different society than in martha and mary's day uh and it's still the same way in some countries in the middle east as a woman you have to be either you're either tied to your father your husband or your brothers they didn't have any free reign so if your father passed away and you weren't married as a woman you were tied to your brothers and it's just that was just eastern society i know that would displease some modern women nowadays but that's just how society was and i'll just read what it had to say here it goes on the 44th and you think that lazarus when he got sick there's no one no sickness until you've had in your own home and i'm sure every one of us tonight can sympathize with martha and mary and how their their only bread maker they had their brother laid sick in the bed and perhaps the doctors had given him up and we're taught that he died with hemorrhages in the lungs and probably tuberculoka i didn't pronounce that right and he died with that condition and when he was sick and the doctors had to give him up then jesus failed to come to his friends so brother branham's talking about whether you're out in your life you might i don't know everyone here but god knows who you are he knows where your heart is and what is pressing you this morning what's laying on your heart and what's like you know god knows where you're at this morning it you might be at your ab this morning wherever that is but god knows where you're at this morning i mean your enemy's gonna try to tell you he doesn't care about you he has no concern for you but god really cares about you and it he died when the condition when he was so sick the doctor had given him up and jesus had failed to come to his friend now there really was a dark diamond that's no different than us this morning you know out there in the world it is a really dark time but you have a hole as long as you stay close to it could you imagine those two beautiful young lady sending for jesus to come and refuse to do it and after they had come out of the church and had denied the old orthodox written and had separated themselves from the other associates of the world and were then putting on putting their whole trust in the man christ who they believed to be the messiah christ then he let them down and that's what i'm trying to say you've put everything that you believe into this message of the hour so don't let the enemy don't let the darkness that you might be facing keep you from the goal that lays before you and he goes on to say we all had them kind of experience i remember when i was first converted and how the people thought i had lost my mind well they said if you keep that kind of religion you'll be in the sameness institution in a few days you've had the same thing or people making fun of you and your associates saying that you went off the deep end but as long as your faith is in christ everything will come out all right don't ever worry about that and now and now i can remember how that the people that's what i'm trying to say this morning no matter what the circumstances are i know it's hard when someone else like says that to you i i know the individual that's feeling that darkness or feeling that dark hour on him when you try to encourage him the devil will try to get on that same heart and say well he really don't care about you he's just saying that to say that and then you have to you have to just push those kinds of thoughts away and just reach out in faith and keep reaching out in faith we all come to that and then he goes on and i'll just finish and in my heart i believe it to be the real thing i jumped the quote here the holy spirit and 20 24 years have passed and it's just as anchored there tonight and he goes in the same determination to serve him as i did the first night i promised him in the little old woodshed and i'm off my thought right now but i'll just finish with this i know i'm jumping around but whatever you see out there in the world or whatever your experience is this morning whatever you're feeling this morning i can say that i know that god cares for you but does that mean anything to you but what really should mean something to you is that the word of god cares about you and jesus christ cares about you this morning and no matter what the devil is telling you what the world is telling you what life is trying to tell you god is more than able to minister to whatever that experience you have or whatever that need you have this morning brother david and you love him all your heart this morning amen appreciate that this morning it's just happy to be in the house of the lord this morning and let's stand if we could this morning and hey man i was thinking that little song as brother brian was finishing up he careth for you through sunshine or shadow he cared for oh he

will turn your bibles to matthew the book of matthew if you will the 20 or the 6th chapter matthew 6 let's read verse i'm going to read the majority of the well i'll just come right down to the bottom of it and then we'll re read more later verse 31 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where with all shall we be clothed for after these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of thee things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you there take therefore no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought of the things of itself sufficiency of the day is the evil thereof may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen this is once again a scripture amen and i i truly believe that there is uh you know i heard i heard somebody tell me one time i was a young person and how they had told me uh that they had actually listened to every one of brother they had just got finished listening to every one of brother branham's messages i mean they seem pretty proud of it and then i guess that you should be right you know but you know i had i was thinking about that yesterday and i was thinking of how that uh how that the word is so eternal that you you can read one scripture and you don't even catch a fraction of what it really is amen and so reading was something once that's one thing i've you know i've ministered these things perhaps 30 years and i still get new things from them and it's still fresh it's still new amen and so but the lord has to quicken it to you amen the lord has to quicken it to you amen and so i feel i feel like the lord's laid a good message on my heart this morning amen and but i want to i want to i want to tell you first of all amen just maybe tell you a little bit how it come about would that be all right amen my god you know he's been working and out there at our place and so forth they're at their place and so he had a project they had to do and he got that done and he told me he was gonna go fishing you know and when you tell your dad you wanna you're gonna go fishing well dad's gonna think about how he can go fishing maybe and so anyway we managed to get to going fishing and he went down there and got started and i took a careful little errand that i had to do we had to do with me and my wife and then we got back and i got my four-wheeler and we went down there to the creek amen uh and michael was already in there and and when i pulled up to him he was already looked like he had put that jerking at something i said oh he's already at it you know and so i parked my four-wheeler and we got i got on the boat and boy was just tearing up down there at the creek he was just pulling them out so y'all remember that on the 11th okay there's some good bass in there i say i'll bring your pulse lords bless us with a real nice creek down there and so anybody likes to fish you but come down and enjoy it amen we want to share it with you all amen and woody i know your boys like to catch them bluegills so y'all bring them amen if you pan but i mean i'm looking forward to the 11th i mean that's when we plan on having that get together okay amen out at the farm so praise the lord but anyway make a long story long let's keep going but anyway so we uh you know what you official all along there we've just seemed like it was catching them left and right and so forth we come down close to that where my property can line kind of ends in the creek and it was just right at the edge right the deep hole and sure enough micah he got a nice big five and a half pound bass right there so he put him back so you all can try to get him he's going and but anyway so he caught that big old bass and boy i said that's a mountain that's a matter of eight pounds because i go a little extreme but he ended up being five and a half and then right after we released him and everything and he looked for his polls his 200 pole first my pole we got so excited nothing dropped off and we never even knew it off in the big old default well anyway i got to watch him go out and get really cold and wet and finally he prayed the lord he found his pole amen he had to put down push down from the trolling motor you know go way as far deep as he could but he managed to find it so we're just glad for that it was a good day after all you know even though it dropped off at all but we went on further down and amen kept fishing down towards the lake got up into the lake and so forth and you know he's just out fishing me and i was like well i'm gonna have to do i learned a lot if i'm gonna get anywhere close to being able to fish as good as him so one time he threw up against uh some grass and he didn't quite get there and i we about three at the same time and and i got a little closer kind of in the grass and pull out his eyes closer than you that means i'm gonna get him you know and sure enough a big old four pounder yes you know and i had my fight i said i told you i was calling it all day he was saying no they're over on this long dialogue yeah that's right but anyway he caught about i think 50 that day and i caught about 14 but anyway so but it was really good may is good amen i think exactly i heard he was upset beshear and he caught five three five pounders two three pounders we're giving the secrets away they're deaf i don't know if i should we're really giving it away but maybe we can maybe we can get somebody all to go fishing man but anyway so we was going down through there and and we was trying to make it down to the other end so that grace could get on the boat at the end of the work day and me get off and get her to get be able to fish and we were kind of going down through there i said i had no idea spall lake was this long and huge look how big it is it's full of fish and i said now why why haven't i come down right here more why haven't i come down here what is wrong with me you know there's a lot of fish right here i got a 328 acre lake right there up against me and i don't even know how to use it you talk about negligence but anyway so he's going down through there and i says my god why i haven't he made a statement that i got my message from this morning because i always try to keep my mind on the lord and he made a statement that caught my attention that i got my message from this morning and he says that's what that's all that life is is about priorities i kind of thought about that statement all life is is about priorities and i thought that's pretty good that's the truth isn't it you know it's because everybody pretty much is doing what they prioritize right they prioritize what they're going to achieve what they're going to do what kind of job they're going to have you know what kind of work you're going to do if you're going to be in politics if you're going to be in construction if you're going to be in lumber if you're going to whatever it is everybody prioritizes what you're going to do i thought life is all i thought it was kind of a strong statement that's all life is is about priorities and i thought that's true though it's true because truly i mean look at us this morning what was your priority this morning your priority was to get the church that right that was your priority that's what you put in your front first priority top priority amen you know and i thought you know that's the reason why i'm not down there more is because i've got other more things other things that are more important right amen and so i thought that is exactly right and i said that's what jesus taught that too jesus taught all about priorities amen so i want to read it i mean i pulled up siri and it gave me the noun part of it i guess i don't know if there's a pronoun positive or not but anyway we're going to read you the meaning of priorities it it says the fact or condition of being regarded or treated as more important another one the thing that is regarded as more important than the other amen isn't that right and everybody on the whole world regards one thing or another more important than the other and that's why everybody does what they do is because they prioritize prioritize how many beliefs that's this what thought this life is all about you have to prioritize amen because you know i don't care you know you think about all of the people that prioritize you can you can go from uh you know uh beachgoers to boaters to fishing to um uh you know i guess they have these bud bargains mud slinging things they have you know and everything else you know it it is whatever people want and desire to do amen and they do what they spend their time doing that amen they spend their time they spend their entire life people do amen in the thing that they have prioritized in their life amen and i thought about this scripture here where jesus says for one place he says he makes a statement he says you know where your treasure is there will your heart be also amen oh how many please that my and i thought you know even the gospel think about it we know that jesus christ went to calvary he paid the rights he did everything that he could do on calvary and then the prophet comes along and says that if jesus was here wearing my suit he couldn't do any more for you so what does it mean that means that you are gonna have to prioritize you're gonna have to decide what you want to do with it praise the lord so it puts it on our lap what you want that's that that's the key folks it's what do you really want amen i don't know about you but i want to do something that is lasting i want to do the best thing that there is to do on the face of the earth are you with me amen i want to do the best thing that you could possibly do and how many knows that is accepting the lord jesus christ that is making christ your treasure [Music] he is at the top of our priorities and a lot of times we have too many uh too many things going too many different priorities amen and you know i think i hit a nerve a little bit and i know i did wednesday when i spoke on something that i felt and i spoke on this wednesday about how that you know uh you know it seems like sometimes we as christians if we aren't careful and then we'll make uh uh turn a new page i call it a new page but it's not really that because when you recommit yourself to god and you you want to focus on god more and you want to be closer to god and you get closer to god and you want to keep your mind on the lord more perhaps and and perhaps a month or two or you don't have that walk that you once had with him and it just seems like sometimes we can go in this circle and then we we got to a place but it isn't long that we get pulled away and that's because of the flesh out here and not just because of this flesh but it's because of the things of the world it just comes to mind to brother bam talk about how that we want that victory we want that all the time but he says it's your job it's your home is your responsibility it's that that pulls you away from it are you with me all these earthly cares that we have pull you away from god big statement are you with me folks i don't know any place where the bible says working harder going to get you closer to god making more money going to get you closer to god getting richer is going to get you closer i don't read anywhere there amen but i mean now jesus told us he was the greatest teacher of priority [Music] oh my and i thought about this and i thought you know this morning i want to tell you where your problem is that okay can i tell you where your problem is how to solve your problem you know it'd be one thing for me to just point out all your bad places right then leave you hanging there you'd have a big old long face you'd really feel bad but i'm glad there's a solution and i believe that god has given us the solution amen amen so jesus begin to talk here in chapter 6 and verse 20 where your treasure is there will your heart be also amen whatever you prioritize that's what you love what you love to do and do every day that's your top priority that's where your heart is and i just want to say that i believe that over in the book of psalms you know david said how many wants to be blessed i don't know about you but i love god's blessings i love god's joy i love to have god with me do you love to have god with you all the time amen david said it this way blessed is a man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the weighted and the center of sinners nor sinneth in the ski seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate day and night hallelujah what is that top priority is where is your mind at where is our thought pattern at amen day and night are you ready to hear some things you don't want to hear you want to hear something you don't want to hear the law is in the minute does he meditate day and night now notice and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season oh my i got to thinking about priorities maybe you want to be a football player and then i'm telling you what you have got to go to summer camp you they own you you got to do and get up when they get up with you you got to eat what they say get it you've got to pack this over and over and over and over and over again until you can run if you're a wide receiver you can run to the full speed job over to the left reach up and catch them with your one little old finger almost you get good at what you do when you keep that priorities right are you with me amen it's when you're a jack-of-all-trade and a master of none that you don't do anything too well huh because you do too many other things there's too many things you are doing and not one thing perfect how many knows and that's what we want to focus on lord help us i don't know about you but i don't care about being a football player i don't care the best fisherman out there i'd like that i'll catch michael but that's not my top priority i can be happy with 14 fish huh but the biggest thing is my top priority is to be a christian i believe that your top priority is to be a christian amen that's your first to be pleasing to the lord amen oh my so notice oh my i thought you know you can't jump in the water without getting wet you can't do one thing over and over again without getting good at it huh if you truly devote yourself to anything you can get really good at it if you really devote yourself to being a christian amen that's exactly the right you'll get do that if somebody smacks you on the face says something bad about you you won't have one ill feeling or that person you'll be able to go to the prayer and get on the clothes and say god bless that person lord help that person they feel terrible they have got to be in misery oh my bless them that curse you isn't that right you get good at it bringeth forth i like that somebody that does that brings forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither praise be the god but the bible says give me a preacher give me a christian or give me a housewife i'm going to add to this that's a christian first give me a housewife that's a christian first give me a farmer that's a christian first give me a factory worker now that he's a christian first a worker that'll put god first in everything and i'll show you a man that be successful despite anything the devil throws at him [Music] glory hey man that's just what the lord shows me that sometimes we get caught up with whatever we're doing until we get more into that we get our mind no forgotten that we wonder where we lost our joy we wonder why we ain't got no amens in church we wonder why we ain't no hallelujah we ain't wondering why there ain't no smoking that's why the holy ghost it's because we got the bible somewhere else we got those priorities that got greater than our first priority that's why we're so quiet that's why we don't have the power of god but i'm saying god is like the ocean up there and he's got a big old pipe fitting down and he can't barely get that power down can't barely get that water going god's gonna want to feel you more than what you're willing to get filled think about it it's all there as much of god as what you want is what you can have but you got to get your priorities right you got to get your priorities straight i got to get my priorities straight amen because it's so easy today so easy to get drowned and choked as jesus said your word becomes choked in you because of the cares of life you know what he said he said because of the cares of life jesus did not care whether he had something to eat for dinner or supper or not he didn't care if he had somewhere to sleep or not he only cared about one thing seeking the kingdom first he wanted the will of the father first huh isn't that right my meat is to do the father's will that's what i love because god will take care of it so the question this morning that we might not want to hear is are we too blessed do we have too much remember israel god said it all in the bible that when it was nothing i gave you this and i blessed you and you got fat and then you forgot me the more they got past the further away from their god they got i'll try to calm down okay just calm down brother calm yourself down but i'm sorry when you jump in the water when you get the holy ghost oh it just does something for you oh my folks i'm not interested in knowing and realizing i'm going in circles huh i'm interested in realizing how to get out of that circle huh what do i do huh huh folks we're up one day and we're down to the next we're in one day and hallelujah the next day we're grumpy huh and by the way i'm saying while the other guy over there he's on the mountaintop all the time amen that's the truth huh but it don't got to be that way huh it's for you too just like him it's for me amen praise be to god now i just realized how this ties together with what brother bannon said now i'll show you a man that's successful despite all that the devil can put on him he seeks god first amen it's always always your christian walk with god is first when you get in a bad situation you wouldn't lose your temper if christ stayed first huh you wouldn't get ill if you just kept christ first is that right oh my and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper how many know that if you'll put god first in that way keep that priorities right and you will prosper no matter what the devil puts in front of you not even death you have to worry about oh i believe we should be like ff where we can be like these great warriors oh i've been waiting for this moment this is my time time this is the greatest moment in my life it's not just for them good old-fashioned holy ghost revival meetings ain't just for the past it's for us here this morning if you put your priorities right like i said jesus taught priorities how may believes it he said i am not come he says think not that i came to earth to send peace i came not to send peace but a sword i am come to set a man at variance against his father and daughter against her mother and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law it's not gonna be a great big happy family if that great big happy family doesn't everyone have christ as their priority because you just can't have fellowship with darkness and rome huh don't you all get quiet on me a man's foes shall be there of his own house he that loveth either mother brother said tomorrow or why more than me hasn't got his priorities right [Music] or your own life or your own self i want to do this and i'm going to do that ask if god wants you to do that this well i'm going to do what i want to do most people do but you better as a christian say this i want to do what god wants me to do not what god i want to do a real christian wants god to have the preeminence in his life folks i hope this is the beginning of something for us i hope this is the beginning of a real revelation folks just since wednesday i said look i'm not gonna fall back in the same rut amen wednesday i really didn't have a message and i was seeking the lord and i was just that wanting that water to flow and and you know i didn't do nothing i didn't do nothing until way up in the way up in the day i would pray and i'd listen to one tape after the other after the other said god i want to get back where i was i'm not where i ought to be huh and that guy one guy give me that message on being sure he wants you to be sure amen they have an anchor in here that he's both sure and steadfast thursday morning get up and play a tape again uh keep on playing because my problem is i'll get busy out in the garage i'll get busy here and there and i know i've got a great light wonderful little beautiful sounding speaker that i can have wi-fi i've got a big telephone that i can play and i can download message and i can be listening to the gospel i can be listening to the message i can be listen to the bible but i'm just too lazy and too busy to get it done anybody else like that in here you're so busy with what you're doing you don't do the most important part that's to keep feeding on the word oh my church i hope this goes down and you get it way down into our tonight this morning and we never part from it it'll change your life since wednesday it doesn't matter if i'm fishing it don't matter what i'm doing i've got my mind on the lord huh i look at his trees i look at that wind blowing and i'll think about that rain that come yesterday and i'll go set me a good old weak jubilee week time praise god man my grass was fine everything was dry thanks you find this wonderful rain the bible says he is the one that waters everything i want to see god in everything don't you amen see him everywhere have you got enough of god have you got enough of god i hope i don't see one hand well like maybe i should if you feel because i just don't see how you can ever feel like you got enough of god do you want more of god want more god oh my praise be to god well i got good news there's more god for you to have but what are you going to have to do very good i want more of jesus more and more and more i want more of jesus than i ever had before i want more of his great love so full so rich and free i want more of jesus so you've got to sacrifice more time for him knows we don't give him enough time no we take too much of the time that he's given us for ourself amen amen i think about it whatever he doeth shall prosper another quote that goes along with another scripture that goes along with that quote about he'll be successful no matter what the devil puts in front of him remember over joshua the other one about putin he said this law of the book now wait a minute only be thou strong first chapter of joshua verse 7 and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it from the right hand or to the left amen that's what time is all about he gets distracted so busy with this and so busy with that he turned from the right or to the left i ain't going to raise for a hand but how many knows you you know that a lot of times you get away from god god don't get away from you he convicts you he brings you back but we get away from god we turn to the right or turn to the left amen no way to get blessed right there listen or to the left that thou mayest prosper whether so ever thou goest brother madam didn't know what he was talking about didn't he and i'll show you a man that'll prosper that'll prosper not i'm not talking about financial you'll prosper spiritually remember david said i put the lord always before me like taking different ways always before me i put god first or i keep reading his word he would read his bible he would pray and always keep god in front of you how many knows that's keeping god with you at all the time and then what we want is god with you no matter where you go and then you'll see more of god's miracles you'll see more of god working praise the lord amen i like that jesus said behold the fowls of the air they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are you much better than they brother bannon would go to a pentecostal meeting and those preachers man i got saved and god has blessed me he's blessed my business i own four cadillacs hey there's a lot of folks probably sitting in here could afford four cadillacs huh you prosper god does prosper you huh but brother baby says don't you go to bragging about those things hollywood's got it on your if that's god's blessing and remember they're more blessed than you are if you're just counting on that for your blessings he says that don't sound like pentecost pentecost they went and they sold everything they had here we go don't get sticky now do we have too much most of us like to get mower huh i remember i used to work with a guy he was a rough character but he says you know they used to call me joel gitmore huh he's always trying to get more i wonder how many get mores we have here this morning come on folks get get in the spirit with me will you that's right we like to get more lord help me i've determined god help me not i don't need anymore i only need what i need what do you give me god don't let me get so much that i don't got the time for god that's the problem that's why our pews are not as full as they are people are too got their priorities somewhere else huh that's why people aren't the kind of christians that's why we're not what we ought to be as christians is because we don't have our priorities right because you get priorities right you make christianity you make christ first i guarantee you you're going to reap the results of a good old-fashioned prayer life a good old-fashioned uh meeting i mean good old praying and reading the bible what's going to happen to you your life's going to change you can't jump in the water without getting wet amen and whatever it is you do when you do it with your whole heart you're gonna get better at it you're gonna get good at it amen that's what christ wants he wants first priority the first priority is not your business it's not about what you wear it's not about the clothes you have or the food that you have to eat or the house that you have to live in it's not first about being a housewife for being a husband it's first about being a christian by serving god how many believe that that's first everything else is secondary we get in trouble we get backslid we lose our hallelujahs we lose the ability the amen because we feel condemned huh we ain't we can't jump in church anymore huh because we don't live very high that's the problem and why is it i strongly feel it up there goes he's telling us we've got it's too easy to get distracted too easy to make christ second or third and then many times the prophet said we put him last most of the time we put it put him last we oh my you don't know how many times on saturday night i go to go to the house and i'll kick myself if i don't quit at noon saturday with whatever i'm doing and suddenly the rest of the day i feel condemned when i start to study that's a really good way to start studying isn't it when you feel bad about yourself no not really because i got too busy and i'm saying i haven't given the last of the day to the lord for tomorrow service people deserve better than that thomas what's wrong with you huh praise the lord what about us you didn't pray all day then in the evening when you're too tired to pray you say a 30-second prayer huh and off the sleep you go and that's all god gets and you wonder why you got trial problems yeah i wonder why we don't have no joy why we come to church and get quiet as a church mouse you can hear him squeak up in the walls you can hear his father calling not in this place lord help us if you don't shout if you don't praise god the rocks will cry out ain't no rocko take my place no no no remember the pharisees they didn't like this type of stuff oh my the scribes the pharisees their priority was prestige there was uh being a big shot being uh looked up to having the uppermost seat pride was their priority that's why they rejected christ amen we need humility folks we need humility you know this week i got to thinking about my faults and and and and things that says man you know compared to look look at yourself how do you compare with god and i remember the scripture and that says i'm compared to god i'm a fishing worm all right you stick them slippery slobbery things on the hook i'm a worm huh compared to god you're a worm brother you better quit calling your congregation worms you ain't gonna have nobody job said in 2010 26 chapter he says how can then how can man be justified with god or how can he be clean that he's born of a woman behold even the moon and the stars shineth not yet the stars are not pure in this sight how much less man that is a worm that's what job said man that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm folks how many knows we were like that mule brother bam talked about when it was born remember the naughty knee born mule he was born and it had as so to speak its tail was in a z-shape wasn't straight it was zigzag knotty knees uglier oh my goodness crippled maybe inbred come on folks it was a mule oh my think about it it says man i'll tell you right now when that owner when he comes out if he sees me decrepit sinful vile absolutely no good in me he's gonna take a sledgehammer to my head and say we're going to end this early on we're going to call this an abortion we're going to kill this thing huh but mama said no they're not gonna kill you're the firstborn you're the firstborn and they the priest they gotta take a sheep a lamb up there and they're gonna sacrifice it for you so you can live you're not gonna die that's what you and i were we were terrible lord we were fit to be killed not fit to live huh yet christ took our on calvary and as ugly and wormy as we are we're washed by the blood of jesus christ god makes us as righteous as god is righteous because of christ i love that don't you hallelujah that's right there's nothing to us so don't think so highly of yourself brother brother brian i believe she says don't think more of yourself than you should i wrote that down that's exactly right don't think so highly of yourself this pharisees thought so highly of themselves anybody that puts their own interpretation their own ideas in the bible they consider themselves higher than god you're not hiring god compare your holiness to his holiness you don't have any holiness amen [Music] but aren't you thankful for his holiness and his righteousness in your heart and life that's the only thing you can present to god amen i thought about my oh worm self worm myself my whole life of the old sometimes i think about my past huh and i think where my priorities were back then and where i was back then the thomas bylera back there drank smoke and all those other things he did everything in the book getting fights get hit over the head run over by cars and still jump up and throw rocks at the cars it's leaving totally you know get hit by a car brother time and children did not sense into me hard-headed you know but guess what wanting to hurt people but i have good news for you this morning that thomas beiler is dead we buried him he's dead and buried we're buried within water baptism in the name of jesus christ the old man is dead what about you aren't you glad to be new didn't quite come and do that for you you died now everything is new you don't smoke you don't dance what do you do for fun come to church with me and i'll show you what i do for fun now i'll show you where my pleasure is my pleasure is insane glory be to god hallelujah it is first in my life he's first in the morning first at midday oh 24 7. he's got to be first how many [Music] leave that praise the lord how many believes that's our problem are you with me our problem is our priorities i don't care what you want from god i don't care if it's healing i don't care what it is you can have it if your priorities are right your priorities have to be right he's not obligated to you if they're not he said if he if you're not willing to forsake your own life you are not worthy of me amen praise be to god 16 26. all right you love him let that sink down here while i'm looking for something okay the ground of a certain man bought brought forth plentiful and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room for to bestow all my fruits and he said this what i would do i will pull down my heart i will build bigger and greater ones and there will i bestow all my fruits and all my goods and i will say to my soul soul thou has much goods laid up many years for many years take thy ease eat drink and be merry and god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then who shall those things be which thou has provided for so is he that left up treasure for himself and is not rich towards god oh i have a hope this morning i believe every one of us have a desire this morning that we want to be rich in god i want to be rich with god in god how many will make that your number one priority i want to be rich in god when our brother or sister gets down or whatever it might be let him god that the holy spirit be so much in me that what i say to him isn't just some off the walls crazy statement because i'm not prayed up like i should be but something that would help that would heal that would be good because how many of those anytime anybody's troubled or anything you can say the right thing or you can really say the wrong thing we all want to be able to say the right thing do the right thing be in tune with god be rich so that's what jesus says here this is your priority don't worry about some bigger barns and bigger this and bigger that make sure that you are rich in god amen i say to you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what for the body what which shall ye shall put on it's not life more than meat embodied in raiment considered a raven state and so not neither do they spin amen but god feedeth them how much more are you better than the fowls amen praise be to god there again it says it in luke but seek the kingdom of god first and all these things shall be added unto you praise the lord let me talk to you a little bit about something else for a minute can i one more scripture towers this i i believe it the bib the bible says one place be careful beware of riches amen because they can absolutely drown your soul drown the spiritual man amen i'm talking to businessmen this morning myself haven't been a businessman i know how easy it is to get caught up isn't that right get too caught up until your business and your business deal is more important than staying quite honest huh or keeping god first in your life it can easily do it let me say this brother bennett said there's just as many millionaires many penny heirs he called them pennies and serious millionaires there's poor people that go after the money just as much as rich people do a lot of times amen and skirt god and push god's last even though they're just penny errors not very much at all but it's about chasing the mighty dollar lord i don't know about you but lord if i if i got to sell what i got if i got a now you know i thought about this and i thought we need to do like walmart says cut back a little bit some cut backs cut backs yeah let me say that again cut back if if it's causing you not to be in like you should be then you need to cut back say god i'm cutting back on this this is taking too much of my time this is taking too much of my time pretty soon you don't have any time when i thought about being ex because as a as a christian remember this other parable now one more priority can i go with one more priority example today this morning that is where he gives us a talent isn't it right he gives one one five one ten what did they do they all gained from those talents didn't they they all gained from those talents and i just in my mind i imagine that god has a wallet in his wallet he has he has money that is called time money time money a time money of a ten dollar bill time money of a twenty dollar bill time money of a thirty dollar bill time money of a forty dollar bill fifty 50 bill 60 bill 70 bill 80 bill brother perry she's cashing in on the 90 dollar bill he's fixing a see a hundred dollar bill yeah a hundred dollar bill in time right remember i'm at 52 says you know i'm 52 years old i'm an old man and if i'm gonna do something for god i better get to doing it huh just here the other day a young man i guess i probably a teenager mike knows in his neighborhood here in elkton i guess a young man got shot didn't he maybe maybe not even 20 years old he didn't even get the cash you know in 20 years that god had given him how many knows god has given us all time the talent of time he gives some 10 he gives them 20 he gives them 30. he might only give somebody maybe 50 50 years of time how many knows he adds your number he knows exactly how much time you have and the question we all have to ask ourselves what did we do how did we spend that money how did we spend that time brother parish the only time money that i don't regret spending is the time money that i have used for the lord huh how does that song the days have wasted are not few but many amen sometimes we waste our time don't we lord help us to use our time what we only have so much i'm cashing in on my 60 dollar bill maybe get the 70 i don't know but i know one thing and i hope this is for you too whatever whatever money he has given you let's use it for him let's use it to let our light shine to our neighbors to the people that come to our store brother irvin huh the people that we deal with to shine that light for christ because you only got so much and then it's going to be spent and you're going to be broke won't have time left keep it right keep that you keep your time bible says redeeming the time for the time is short you got to bring it back you got to say lord i'm wasting too much time on this and wasting too much time on that when i be needing to be using it for you more amen praise the lord how do you do it how do we actually put this into effect one thing is the way that you're going to be a better christian from this morning on and keep that priority the way that it's supposed to be in keeping christ first is discipline discipline is self-control making yourself do what your body perhaps don't want to do amen for me when i'm so into something i want to just do this and i say no stop take 10 minutes and get the prophet playing or the bible playing get out in the garage or got a little workbench there and everything or whatever and and and hey comes to my mind i need to pray a little right and just get down to kneel and pray more than what you do find the place to pray it makes a huge difference how many believes that find a place to pray find a place to just dedicate to god more amen we need it self-control or discipline is what it takes because how many knows we're in a world where there is just no discipline people don't discipline their self or control yourself they go with the feeling or the mood or whatever it is that's not what we're here to do amen let's stop and think about it and that is we need to be richer in god how many need to be richer than what you are i am not rich enough in god i don't have enough more enough of the holy spirit like i should have my priority is to be ready and waiting when he comes my priorities to see him when he splits the eastern sky when all the saints of all the ages come forth i want to be ready i don't care about all the other priority everybody else politicians sports music stars gospel music stars whatever just whatever whatever your priorities that's you my heart's desire is to have the lord always before me and not get pulled away not something sinful maybe but just not keeping your mind on the lord like you should not doing what the bible says keep him on his law does he meditate day and night that's first i'm gonna remember your mind god wants your mind because if you got your mind he's gonna have your heart amen how many is guilty of not keeping on your mind like you should honestly how many is we got to be honest how many knows for a fact that that's why some of the problems that you have the anxiety nervousness you're going to get nervous if you get away from god yes i do you get nervous you're like no i don't feel right my feelings get messed up when i get away from the lord i i don't like this huh i fish till four o'clock on saturday i i'm getting nervous get me off this water i want to go pray tell me more important things folks pressing amen you love the lord we'll close with that my hope is a blessing to you give me somebody like that brother says i'll tell you now you'll be successful you'll have a good christian walk with the lord and no matter what comes your way you will overcome it by god's grace if you have priorities all right let's stand this morning let's not multitask so much okay let's keep focused on our main task that's the right and christians before the lord let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you lord and we're so grateful lord jesus that we don't have to just imagine or desire to have this but you made it possible on calvary and i know lord jesus from experience that whenever anybody ever really sets their heart to serve you like old buddy robinson he absolutely put the reins down of with his mules and his horse and his plow and he says god if you don't come and give me the holy ghost die you'll find the pile of bones lord he put you first his top priority was to have that holy ghost lord if we'll do that same thing it doesn't matter who it is in here anybody that doesn't have the holy ghost like they should have lord help him this morning right now to say i now raise my hand and say i'm putting god first my number one priority is to be a christian and to be holy ghost filled no matter how much the devil tries to tell me or i think of myself as not worthy i'm not looking at my worthiness i'm looking at his worthiness god bless those hands god bless you god bless you lord jesus our hands are up we're saying god we want to be filled with your holy spirit we want more of you we want to we want to do exactly what you said to do lord jesus not worrying about bigger barns and just that or the other but we're more concerned about being rich in you this morning that is our top priority lord is to be rich in you father and we raise our hands to you lord this morning and i pray god from this morning on that we will not go out of here just have heard another message lord but to have heard from you speaking to our hearts and we will change what we do and the way that we do it lord because we can never expect to have any different things happen lord doing the same thing lord but we will discipline ourselves control ourselves and say god this is what i'll do lord father how blessed it's been what a blessing it's been for me just and lord the adjustment that i've made lord in doing what you said draw nigh to you and you will draw an eye to us so lord you're waiting on us so father we're here raising our hands saying god i want to be closer to you lord i pray that every person in here after this morning would be able to go out those doors and have more of the love of god in their hearts and lord and to be absolutely legit that they will spend the rest of their time that you gave them for you lord jesus the talent that you've given them so or perhaps be able to win another soul to you lord because your prophet taught us that if we're not willing souls to winning souls then we're failing lord take that money that you have given us and to be able to win one soul that would be worth a thousand worlds lord help us to be a witness for you that's our top priority in whatever we do forgive us lord also father we ask now as we raise our hands in the name of jesus we ask god that you would forgive us of lord where we have lord you know god sidetrack so often we do so easily and in the cares of life and how busy we are we're just too busy lord and we ask god that you'd help us to bring back some of that time say god i'm bringing back more time for you and i'm going to stay focused on you yes i have to do this i have to do that to live but god it's you first before all that we love you lord this morning and once again we ask god that you would accept lord our repentance and say forgive me drop it under your blood of jesus christ every heart right now lord beneath every mind that thinking it lord come down with your holy spirit now father and drop those sins in the bleach of jesus christ next wednesday night when we come back together lord we won't be like we were when we came this morning and the following sunday from this on day forward lord we're going to be different lord jesus lord thank you father for speaking to us thank you lord for laying food on my heart to gifted the people lord and to myself lord for feeding me lord we ask god that you help us to learn teach us your ways in jesus christ's name amen and amen let's just thank the lord by giving him a hand shake the hand clap say thank you lord jesus we worship you we praise you lord we glorify you lord amen amen do you love one another turn and shake somebody's hands that god bless you sure good to be in the house of the lord amen it's good to be in the house of the lord brother david by the way god bless you i love you brother better perish lord bless you love you buddy god bless you
