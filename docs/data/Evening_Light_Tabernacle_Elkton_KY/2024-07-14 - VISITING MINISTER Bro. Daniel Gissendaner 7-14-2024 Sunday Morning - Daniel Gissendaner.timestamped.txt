[26:03] good morning we'll uh turn and read
[26:05] Psalms
[26:22] 37 we'll read verses uh 1-
[26:25] 24 fret not thyself because of evildoers
[26:29] neither be thou envious against the
[26:30] workers of
[26:37] iniquity trust in the Lord and do good
[26:40] so shalt thou dwell in the land and
[26:42] verily Thou shalt be
[26:49] fed commit thy way unto the Lord trust
[26:52] also in him and he shall bring it to
[26:55] pass he shall bring for
[27:02] rest in the Lord and wait patiently for
[27:04] him fret not thyself because of him who
[27:06] prosper in his way because of the man
[27:09] who bringeth Wicked devices to
[27:17] pass for evildoers shall be cut off but
[27:21] those that wait upon the Lord they shall
[27:22] inherit the earth
[27:33] but the meek shall inherit the earth and
[27:35] shall Delight themselves in the
[27:36] abundance of
[27:42] Peace the Lord shall laugh at him for he
[27:45] seeth that his day is coming
[27:58] their sword shall enter into their own
[28:00] heart and their bows shall be
[28:09] broken for the arms of the wicked shall
[28:11] be broken but the Lord upholdeth the
[28:19] righteous they shall not be ashamed in
[28:21] the evil time and in the days of famine
[28:25] they shall be satisfied
[28:37] the wicked Borth and payeth not again
[28:39] but the righteous showeth mercy and
[28:49] giveth the steps of a good man are
[28:51] ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in
[28:53] his way though he fall he shall not be
[28:57] utterly cast down for the Lord with his
[29:00] hand brother
[29:15] Brian Lord bless you all be
[29:19] seated
[29:22] sorry you know I was uh thinking as we
[29:25] read that Psalm excuse me there was a
[29:27] script scure
[29:29] there uh on the 16th scripture there
[29:32] little that the righteous manad is
[29:34] better than the riches of many Wicked so
[29:36] that just lets me know as a Bible
[29:38] believer what wherever God puts you you
[29:41] got to be satisfied in in life you and
[29:45] it's pretty simple you know you see a
[29:47] lot of people might be doing better have
[29:49] more whatever that doesn't mean anything
[29:53] if God has just given you a little and
[29:55] you're happy in it that's all you really
[29:56] need you don't need any more than that
[29:59] and I was thinking you know what brother
[30:00] Thomas was praying about you know
[30:02] sometimes we get in a hurry so much in
[30:05] our life that we miss the little things
[30:07] that God does for us that you know I
[30:10] know for myself being a service tech all
[30:12] these years I'll get in a hurry to go
[30:14] somewhere and there'll be always that
[30:16] one driver that's driving 50 miles an
[30:19] hour keeping you from getting to where
[30:21] you need to be and then you get in a
[30:23] hurry and all of a sudden three or four
[30:25] miles down the road there's a T-bone
[30:27] accident well you might have been the
[30:29] person in that accident if you had if
[30:31] you'd been in a hurry sometimes we
[30:33] forget how much God cares for us and
[30:35] desires to see us prosper in our lives
[30:38] that we shouldn't be in a hurry to do
[30:40] things we just should commit everything
[30:42] that we do every day into the hands of a
[30:44] living God and at the as I was I was
[30:48] thinking this morning on the that first
[30:50] slide this morning of that little
[30:52] country church and I was reminiscing you
[30:55] know it's what been about 34 32 years
[30:58] ago we were in a little Country Church
[31:01] like that you know how time goes so fast
[31:03] sometimes we went from The Little
[31:05] Country Church where you had to share
[31:07] the bathroom with the groundhogs to what
[31:09] we have here this morning so you God has
[31:13] really blessed us this morning and
[31:15] through those blessings we're able to
[31:18] bless his people back at the same time
[31:20] we shouldn't be always taking we should
[31:22] be given back and it was talking about
[31:24] Works without faith you know faith
[31:27] without works it doesn't mean anything
[31:30] everything that God gives us should be
[31:32] to make us successful and want to help
[31:35] one one another but if you would turn
[31:37] I'm off my point but if you would turn
[31:39] with me to Luke the 20th chapter
[31:43] here if I can find my place this
[31:49] morning and uh this one Parable here
[31:52] I'll read this one Parable here this
[31:55] morning
[31:59] this is the chapter where Jesus this is
[32:02] that last couple of weeks and Jesus is
[32:04] in the temple teaching we all know the
[32:07] Pharisees wouldn't accept his teachings
[32:09] but I I'll uh starting about the seventh
[32:12] verse here this
[32:16] morning also I was thinking you know the
[32:19] world we live in before I get started
[32:21] you know brother randam always taught in
[32:23] his messages he always would go back to
[32:26] the Stone Age you know they had the
[32:27] wheel and the Stone Age and then they
[32:30] had the oxen the plow and everyone
[32:32] plowed with the oxen and a wooden plow
[32:35] and that that was their state of
[32:37] technology and that was for hundreds of
[32:39] years thousands of years and then they
[32:41] were able to domesticate the horse and
[32:44] saddle and bridle it and plow and move
[32:46] with it and then they went from the
[32:48] horse to the combustion engine and
[32:51] before the combustion engine the steam
[32:53] engine from the steam engine to the
[32:56] combustion engine and and the electric
[32:58] engine at that time and then he talked
[33:01] about we're in that rocket age where
[33:03] they had chemical Rockets chemical power
[33:06] to be able to move it speeds what what
[33:09] the Earth revolves around about 24,000
[33:12] miles an hour the speed that kind of
[33:15] speed and I was just thinking this
[33:17] morning well well past the chemical
[33:19] rocket age I mean you're almost in the
[33:22] point where things happen instantaneous
[33:25] like you're not not being a going real
[33:27] crazy you're almost like can warp drive
[33:29] everything that's happening around the
[33:31] world this morning and it just lets me
[33:33] know in my heart that every day is
[33:35] important for me to be in the right
[33:37] position that God wants me to be in this
[33:40] morning that my heart is sealed in in in
[33:43] his grace and in his kingdom this
[33:45] morning and anything outside of that
[33:47] ain't worth worrying about this morning
[33:50] but uh the world that we live in is such
[33:52] a deceitful place it's trying it's
[33:55] trying to bind every bind us every day
[33:58] into things that really don't matter if
[34:00] you're not careful the world will bind
[34:02] you will make you miserable take away
[34:05] your Victory if you let it and before
[34:07] you know it the more the more it binds
[34:09] you it just keeps binding you it never
[34:11] looses those binds so the thing about
[34:14] being a Christian this morning is being
[34:16] free in Jesus Christ this morning if you
[34:18] don't have the freedom in Jesus Christ
[34:21] this morning then you that's what you're
[34:23] here for this morning is to be free like
[34:26] brother Smith said last week you know
[34:28] you have to have that Liberty however
[34:30] God expresses it through you you need
[34:33] the liberty of the Lord this morning but
[34:35] I'll just read what this has to say this
[34:37] morning and uh this is Jesus gave the
[34:41] other Parable they were asking him by
[34:43] what Authority he did the things he did
[34:45] you know and this is starting at about
[34:49] the eth verse and Jesus said on neither
[34:52] tell I you by what Authority I do these
[34:54] again then he speaks this Parable then
[34:57] then he spake to the people this Parable
[35:00] a certain man planted a Vineyard and let
[35:02] LED forth a husbandman and went into a
[35:05] far country for a long time that's
[35:06] speaking where we're at this morning
[35:09] also and at a season he sent a servant
[35:12] to be a husband and should give him of
[35:15] the fruit of the vineyard but the
[35:16] husbandman beat him and sent him away
[35:19] empty and again he sent another servant
[35:22] and they beat him also and ENT treated
[35:24] him shamefully and sent him away empty
[35:27] and again he sent a third and wounded
[35:29] him also and cast him out you know that
[35:31] speaks to the Pharisees also speaks to
[35:35] the world we live in this morning and
[35:37] they said the Lord of The Vineyard what
[35:39] shall I do will I send my beloved Son it
[35:42] may be that they will rev him and they
[35:44] will see him but when the husband men
[35:47] saw him they reasoned among themselves
[35:49] saying this is the hair has come let him
[35:53] kill him that the inheritance might be
[35:54] ours so they cast him out of the
[35:56] vineyard and killed him what therefore
[35:58] shall the Lord of The Vineyard do unto
[36:01] them he he shall come and destroy these
[36:03] husband men and shall give the vineyard
[36:06] to the others and when they heard they
[36:08] they said God forbid and then this is
[36:11] what I was thinking about last week and
[36:14] he beheld them and said what is this
[36:17] then that this is written the stone
[36:19] which the builders rejected is the same
[36:21] become the head of the corner and
[36:23] whosoever shall fall upon this Stone
[36:25] shall be broken but who who soever it
[36:28] shall fall it will grind him to powder
[36:30] and that's basically what I was thinking
[36:32] that's our choice this morning you
[36:34] either fall on the S on the stone and
[36:36] you let God break you this morning or
[36:39] one day that stone is going to fall upon
[36:41] the whole earth and it's going to
[36:43] shatter it to pieces and you have that
[36:45] choice we all have that choice this
[36:47] morning and you can jump to Peter first
[36:50] Peter the second chapter here
[36:59] I think I got the right place here I
[37:01] might
[37:02] have been thinking too much and
[37:08] then yeah it's the second chapter of uh
[37:12] first Peter I mean these scriptures mean
[37:16] as much today as they did in Peter's Day
[37:18] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[37:21] all G and hypocrisies and envies and
[37:24] evil speakings you know all the
[37:27] scripture
[37:28] that we read whether it was in Moses's
[37:31] time or in our time it continually is
[37:33] fresh and it speaks to our hearts every
[37:36] day that's right if you keep yourself
[37:39] open and as newborn babies desire the
[37:41] sincere milk of the word that you might
[37:44] grow
[37:45] thereby and you can only grow by the
[37:48] word of God if you if you're one of
[37:49] those Christians that reads it on every
[37:52] Sunday morning and puts it away the rest
[37:54] of the week that's going to be your
[37:56] growth that's as big as your plant's
[37:58] going to be but you have to read it
[38:00] daily and it goes on to say it so be
[38:03] that you have tasted the Lord is
[38:04] gracious to whom coming as onto a living
[38:08] Stone disavowed indeed of men but chosen
[38:11] of God and precious ye also are Lively
[38:14] stones that are built up a spiritual
[38:16] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[38:20] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[38:23] by Jesus Christ that's where we're at
[38:25] this morning wherefore all also if the
[38:28] contained in the scriptures behold I lay
[38:30] and Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect
[38:33] precious and he that believeth on him
[38:35] shall not be confounded and this goes
[38:37] back to the 20th chapter of Luke this is
[38:40] the choice we make every day and he goes
[38:42] on unto you there fors which believe he
[38:44] is precious but unto them which be
[38:47] disobedient that stone which the
[38:48] builders disavow the same is made the
[38:52] head of the corner and a stone of
[38:54] stumbling and a rock offense even to
[38:57] them which stumble at the word being
[38:59] disobedient where on they were appointed
[39:02] but you are a chosen generation a royal
[39:05] Pethood a holy nation and this is really
[39:08] important not that you make yourself
[39:11] peculiar but God just through his
[39:13] changing your heart and life makes you a
[39:15] peculiar person to the people that
[39:17] you're around they look at you and they
[39:19] see something in you that they might
[39:21] want something in you that's different
[39:24] that makes you peculiar and it's not you
[39:26] doing it myself not repeating myself but
[39:29] it's really important it's not you doing
[39:31] it it's God in your heart changing you
[39:33] and making you who he wants you to be in
[39:36] the age that we live in this morning and
[39:39] uh CH uh I'm going to re repeat myself
[39:42] here I'm let me find my place
[39:45] peace I lost my place
[39:49] here yeah you are a chosen generation a
[39:52] royal priesthood a holy nation A
[39:54] peculiar people you should show forth
[39:56] the Praises of him who has called you
[39:58] out of the darkness into His Marvelous
[40:00] Light which in time past were not a
[40:02] people but now are a people of God which
[40:05] obtained
[40:06] mercy and and now have obtained Mercy
[40:09] dearly beloved I beseech you as
[40:11] strangers and
[40:13] pilgrims again I mean this time and time
[40:16] again through the scriptures abstaining
[40:18] from freshly lust which war against the
[40:20] soul and having your conversations
[40:23] honest among the Gentiles that whereas
[40:25] they speak against you as evil doers
[40:28] they may by your good works which show
[40:31] be beheld the glory god in the day of
[40:34] visitation so you don't know I'll just
[40:37] finish with this thought you know a lot
[40:40] of times you know we get it in ruts in
[40:42] our lives we get in
[40:44] circumstances but that man out there or
[40:46] that woman out there he's watching you
[40:48] when you he sees the Hard Knocks eating
[40:50] you in your life he's watching you
[40:52] seeing how what your character is and
[40:55] seeing how you react to the hard
[40:57] situations in your life he's and if he
[41:00] sees you acting like the true Christian
[41:02] you are going through the struggles of
[41:04] your life you be surprised how much that
[41:06] changes people in the life if you just
[41:09] be the example for them this morning so
[41:12] may God bless you all Brother
[41:19] David amen you love the Lord this

[1:17:54] say I've done something you ain't done
[1:17:56] nothing when you come to church put your
[1:17:58] all into
[1:18:00] it worship God in spirit and TR from
[1:18:03] your heart when you leave he here be as
[1:18:06] sweaty as the
[1:18:09] preacher oh y'all just sit there and
[1:18:11] some of you take your your morning nap
[1:18:13] on Sunday morning shame on you that's
[1:18:16] right sitting there on Facebook shame on
[1:18:22] you some can give a little some can give
[1:18:25] you know all can give some there's only
[1:18:29] a few that can give
[1:18:31] all Jesus makes a note of this little
[1:18:34] widow woman that threw in two mes a
[1:18:38] fifth of a penny
[1:18:40] each now these other rich men were
[1:18:42] throwing in from the abundance of their
[1:18:44] treasury no big deal drop in a 50 or 20
[1:18:48] $100 bill no big deal to them they got
[1:18:51] an abundance they gave some but she gave
[1:18:55] all he said she gave all her living now
[1:19:00] if I was to preach the book of Acts this
[1:19:02] morning as if we was in the book of Acts
[1:19:05] then people brought Peter
[1:19:10] everything got no Bible readers here
[1:19:13] signed over their property to
[1:19:16] him remember Anan and Safar they didn't
[1:19:19] have to tell him a lie they didn't even
[1:19:21] have to give him out all the money from
[1:19:22] the prophet just don't lie to God
[1:19:27] but they were willing the other people
[1:19:29] were will willing to to come in and lay
[1:19:31] their treasures at Peter's
[1:19:35] feet if if I preach that which is in the
[1:19:38] Bible I wonder how many people would be
[1:19:41] willing because that's what he's looking
[1:19:43] for obedient heart willing
[1:19:46] heart when the Rich Young Ruler come to
[1:19:49] Jesus he said what must I do to inherit
[1:19:51] eternal life and Jesus said Keep keep
[1:19:54] the Commandments I wonder how many this
[1:19:57] morning can answer him the same way the
[1:20:01] Rich Young Ruler did he said all these
[1:20:03] have I done from my
[1:20:05] youth there ain't a person here that can
[1:20:08] say you've kept all Ten Commandments
[1:20:10] from your
[1:20:11] youth but he had that testimony all
[1:20:14] these have I done for my youth and Jesus
[1:20:16] looked at him and said one
[1:20:20] thing one thing only that thou lackest
[1:20:24] yeah
[1:20:27] he wasn't willing now Jesus didn't
[1:20:29] require him to give everything that he
[1:20:31] had but he wanted him to be willing to
[1:20:34] give everything that he had you see the
[1:20:37] difference God don't require it but he
[1:20:40] wants you to be willing cuz I'm tell you
[1:20:42] you could drop right now with a heart
[1:20:44] attack and what work you ain't taking
[1:20:46] your money with
[1:20:48] you only one thing you're taking with
[1:20:50] you my friend is character and character
[1:20:53] is not a gift it is a victory so
[1:20:55] therefore you got to fight for it you
[1:20:58] ain't taking a dime with
[1:21:02] you we measure people in society by how
[1:21:06] much they own or or how many toys they
[1:21:09] have how many trips they've been on how
[1:21:12] many times they've been around the world
[1:21:13] and in the Caribbean and here and there
[1:21:15] and there God God God don't measure
[1:21:17] people like that he rebuked
[1:21:20] Samuel when Samuel went down to
[1:21:23] Bethlehem to find a king and King seen
[1:21:25] the the old son of Jesse eliab and he
[1:21:29] said surely th this is this is the man
[1:21:31] that God has chose to be
[1:21:33] king because the standard at that time
[1:21:37] was King Saul Head and Shoulders above
[1:21:39] all of Israel and so eliab was a
[1:21:41] good-sized man so Samuel was was uh
[1:21:45] measuring eliab up against
[1:21:48] Saul and God said I have rejected
[1:21:53] him I I don't look at man like you look
[1:21:56] at
[1:21:58] man we need all of us this morning under
[1:22:01] the sound of my voice we we need to
[1:22:03] empty our pockets of
[1:22:07] rocks ain't a person here got a right to
[1:22:10] throw a rock at nobody for all have
[1:22:13] sinned and come short of the glory of

[1:23:27] see we preachers today are so proper and
[1:23:29] Prim and we can't say things like that
[1:23:31] but I
[1:23:32] do because I'm a
[1:23:35] renegade and I don't care what anybody
[1:23:37] thinks about me you can take your
[1:23:40] opinion of me and shove it down the
[1:23:42] sewer because I don't care what you
[1:23:43] think about me I I care what you think
[1:23:46] about the word I'm preaching to
[1:23:48] you cuz I ain't I ain't I I ain't
[1:23:51] perfecting you the word is perfecting
[1:23:53] you so therefore I don't care what you
[1:23:56] think about oh he's a hard preacher you
[1:23:58] ain't been listening to many
[1:24:02] tapes I've been accused of being a heart
[1:24:04] breacher he brother Daniel's got no love
[1:24:06] this is the house of

[1:24:34] all like I said it's not just about
[1:24:36] money when you come to church when
[1:24:39] you're witnessing to
[1:24:41] somebody at least act like you're happy
[1:24:44] about about your religion at least act
[1:24:46] like it be
[1:24:49] salty Shine Your Light there may be a
[1:24:51] seat of God in there come on
[1:24:56] see the Comm the Great Commission is not
[1:24:59] just to
[1:25:01] ministers go you into all the world it's
[1:25:03] not just to
[1:25:04] preachers you have your own congregation
[1:25:07] in your world that you preach to every
[1:25:10] day of your life and it's your lived
[1:25:14] voice the testimony that you live in
[1:25:16] front of the of them is preaching to
[1:25:21] them and in many ways you reach more
[1:25:24] people than we can cuz I I don't live
[1:25:27] here I'm not I'm not in your everyday
[1:25:29] world I don't work with you I don't know
[1:25:31] your
[1:25:32] co-workers I don't know know your
[1:25:34] intimate family but you
[1:25:36] do so it's up to you to Shine the Light
[1:25:39] it's up to you to be salty come on
[1:25:42] somebody the the it ain't up to the
[1:25:44] preachers to do it all we're not nians
[1:25:47] we don't take the power from the people
[1:25:50] every Christian has the authority that a
[1:25:53] pastor does
[1:25:56] if your child falls on the driveway and
[1:25:58] breaks it his leg on falls off a bicycle
[1:26:00] whatever falls out a tree playing TOs
[1:26:02] and whatever you got to write anoint him
[1:26:05] with oil pray for him right you don't
[1:26:07] have to wait for brother berer call call
[1:26:09] on God and God will raise him up he'll
[1:26:13] hear a Mama's Prayer he'll hear a
[1:26:15] daddy's prayer he'll hear a lay man's
[1:26:21] prayer but see we we want to put the you
[1:26:24] know like when God came down to Adam and
[1:26:26] said what hast thou done and Adam
[1:26:29] said that woman you gave
[1:26:32] me everybody wants to play the blame
[1:26:34] game and put off on somebody
[1:26:38] else on want somebody else to take care
[1:26:41] of it they don't want the
[1:26:43] responsibility they want don't want the
[1:26:45] monkey on their back so to speak it's
[1:26:48] easy to do that that woman you gave me
[1:26:50] he's actually blaming God for the fall
[1:26:53] if you you hadn't give me that
[1:26:56] woman there wouldn't have been a
[1:27:01] fall we do the same thing we grow up we
[1:27:04] come we become men and women we get
[1:27:07] married and we got we got Hang-Ups we
[1:27:09] got issues we got habits and we blame it
[1:27:11] on our
[1:27:13] parents I got this from my daddy it's
[1:27:15] genetic Holy Ghost stops
[1:27:20] genetics Holy Ghost stops culture
[1:27:25] remember brother brand in Africa
[1:27:26] preaching them half naked women in in
[1:27:29] the audience they didn't know no
[1:27:30] different they weren trying to be sexy
[1:27:33] that's how they dressed that was their
[1:27:34] culture and he said how many wants to
[1:27:36] receive the Holy Ghost and they raised
[1:27:38] their hand and came back the next night
[1:27:41] dressed covered up he didn't tell them
[1:27:44] to do that God the Holy Ghost in them
[1:27:47] told them to cover
[1:27:51] up if you ever get a real taste of the
[1:27:54] the Holy Ghost the desire for that
[1:27:56] nonsense will leave you you don't have
[1:27:59] to quit it he'll quit it for
[1:28:03] you that hunger that craving that desire
[1:28:06] for alcohol and drugs and women ging
[1:28:09] he'll take it from you if you're willing
[1:28:12] to give it to
[1:28:13] him you got to be willing to give it up
[1:28:17] and he'll take every one of them from
[1:28:19] you this
[1:28:21] morning I've had my hangups
[1:28:25] I've had my
[1:28:26] dependencies I've had my demons I
[1:28:28] struggled with with that I couldn't
[1:28:30] overcome by myself so I had to come to a
[1:28:34] place said God I'm giving it all to you
[1:28:36] because the battle is yours said Little
[1:28:38] David David was no match for Goliath
[1:28:42] you're no match for the devil but my God
[1:28:44] is more than a match for the
[1:28:50] devil if you'll be willing to lay it on
[1:28:53] the to say God I can't do it take it
[1:28:56] from me take the desire from me and
[1:29:00] you'll never do it again after brother
[1:29:02] Brandon baptized PO papax he never
[1:29:05] smoked
[1:29:08] again because he knew what the Holy
[1:29:10] Ghost would do inside of him it ain't
[1:29:13] you getting cleaned up to take a
[1:29:16] bath well well I'll come to church as
[1:29:19] soon as I stop doing this no you need to
[1:29:21] be in church while you're doing it and
[1:29:24] let the Holy Ghost change your nature
[1:29:27] change your
[1:29:28] desire because if there if there's
[1:29:31] anything you can do to get into heaven
[1:29:34] Jesus died in
[1:29:35] vain there's nothing you can do you
[1:29:38] cannot be good enough to get into the
[1:29:40] kingdom go of God he paid the price and
[1:29:43] we get the
[1:29:47] reward I remember a story I might have
[1:29:49] told it here it's been a while since
[1:29:51] I've been here but Bear's repeating
[1:29:54] there was a man that had just got saved
[1:29:56] and he started ministering to drug
[1:29:58] addicts and alcoholics and people like
[1:30:00] that he he was he was a horrible addict
[1:30:03] addict himself and so he was the one
[1:30:06] Church giving his testimony and a man
[1:30:09] come up to him after service and uh he
[1:30:12] said uh brother so and so I'm struggling
[1:30:15] with
[1:30:17] marijuana he said uh do I have to quit
[1:30:20] smoking dope to accept Jesus
[1:30:24] and the preacher looked at him said
[1:30:32] no some of you ain't getting
[1:30:36] it I'm going to rewind it do I have to
[1:30:40] stop smoking dope to accept Jesus he
[1:30:43] said no he said the man asked me three
[1:30:47] times do I have to smoke stop smoking
[1:30:51] marijuana to accept Jesus he said no
[1:30:54] then then he pulled the joint out of his
[1:30:56] pocket the marijuana joint the
[1:31:00] doobie back in the day that's what they
[1:31:02] called
[1:31:03] it right he pulled it out of his pocket
[1:31:06] and waved it in front of the nose of the
[1:31:08] man man had just been delivered from it
[1:31:10] and he's going I rebuke you in Jesus
[1:31:12] name I rebuke you in Jesus name he said
[1:31:15] do I have to stop smoking this to accept
[1:31:17] Jes he said read my
[1:31:20] lips
[1:31:22] no and and the adct said I don't
[1:31:25] understand why I don't have to quit this
[1:31:27] to accept Jesus one of the most powerful
[1:31:31] things come out of a a human mouth was
[1:31:34] these words do you have to get cleaned
[1:31:36] up to take a
[1:31:45] bath cuz if you can clean yourself up
[1:31:48] you don't need a
[1:31:51] bath that's right because you quit it on
[1:31:54] your own you'll pick it back up on your
[1:31:57] own but if he takes it from you you'll
[1:32:00] hate from that day forward you'll never
[1:32:03] desire it
[1:32:09] again and you got to give it all give it
[1:32:12] all to him say Lord I can't do this on
[1:32:14] my own I give it to you take it from me
[1:32:17] take the desire from
[1:32:18] me it's it's been millions of people
[1:32:21] stop smoking C cigarettes and through
[1:32:23] them in the woods and watch where they
[1:32:26] landed threw a half bottle of liquor in
[1:32:28] the woods and watch where it landed so
[1:32:31] they could go back in the middle of the
[1:32:32] night pick it up they didn't give it up
[1:32:35] they just going through the
[1:32:37] motions people coming to church ain't
[1:32:39] even Sav they're just going through the
[1:32:40] motions because they don't want to go to
[1:32:41] hell I don't go to church because I'm
[1:32:44] scared of hell I already deserve hell
[1:32:47] whether I come to church or
[1:32:50] not I'm not worthy of heaven I'm not
[1:32:52] worthy of Mansion I'm not worthy of
[1:32:55] golden streets Gates of Pur walls ofest
[1:32:57] I'm not worthy of that that on my best
[1:33:00] day it's only by Grace any of us are
[1:33:04] going to get there not of Works lest any
[1:33:08] man should
[1:33:10] boast you can't be good enough for
[1:33:13] Christ to receive you because God
[1:33:16] himself don't see you he sees the blood
[1:33:20] anyway because if he seen you he would
[1:33:23] never accept you in your condition but
[1:33:26] thank God he don't see me he hears my
[1:33:29] voice coming up through the blood when I
[1:33:32] see the blood I'll pass over you he
[1:33:35] didn't open the door and look inside he
[1:33:37] was looking for the token he was looking
[1:33:39] for the life he was looking for the
[1:33:40] blood and once he seen the blood he
[1:33:43] passed over
[1:33:45] them that's what he's looking for today
[1:33:47] the token life and once he sees the life
[1:33:50] he'll pass over you remember now you you
[1:33:54] go read Exodus 12 and find out who the
[1:33:57] death angel really is the death angel my
[1:34:00] friend is is not
[1:34:02] Satan because God said behold I will
[1:34:05] pass through Egypt this night and I will
[1:34:08] Smite all the
[1:34:10] firstborn go read it I'm a Bible reader
[1:34:14] I know what I'm talking about behold I
[1:34:17] will pass through Egypt this night and I
[1:34:19] will Smite on the first woman that don't
[1:34:21] have the blood on on the doorpost in
[1:34:23] Atlanta
[1:34:25] God's the one doing
[1:34:28] it you know who's going to bring
[1:34:30] Vengeance and wrath on this generation
[1:34:32] it ain't the devil it's God I promise
[1:34:36] you you don't want to be here under the
[1:34:38] Vengeance and the wrath of
[1:34:41] God Satan has nothing on God when it
[1:34:44] comes to wrath and
[1:34:46] Vengeance that's why even the
[1:34:50] elements that you can't see are going to
[1:34:52] burn with a fect
[1:34:55] heat in the Millennium excuse in the uh
[1:34:58] tribulation I promise you you don't want
[1:35:01] to be
[1:35:02] here and and we even see pre-tribulation
[1:35:05] things going on
[1:35:07] now now I'll be real careful when I say
[1:35:11] this but under this current presidential
[1:35:14] Administration uh almost 12 million
[1:35:17] illegal immigrants now I'm not in any
[1:35:20] any shape form or fashion racist every
[1:35:23] every body All Nations tribes tongues
[1:35:26] colors races or will be in the body of
[1:35:30] Christ and I have no problem with
[1:35:33] immigrants coming to this country if I
[1:35:35] was an immigrant I'd want to come to
[1:35:36] this country but do it the right
[1:35:39] way don't do it illegally nearly 12
[1:35:43] million under this Administration has
[1:35:46] snuck in illegally and now they're
[1:35:48] killing and rap raping a kids and a
[1:35:50] women
[1:35:53] brute beasts and they're doing nothing
[1:35:56] about
[1:35:58] it so here we are living inia and the
[1:36:02] Bible says Luke 17 as it was in the days
[1:36:04] of Noah go look what was happening in
[1:36:06] the days of Noah days of
[1:36:08] violence and the days of of uh lot
[1:36:13] perversion and violence what got them
[1:36:18] both R running over the cup
[1:36:24] like brother B said in his prayer
[1:36:26] somebody tried to take up P Trump last
[1:36:29] night but see if if if God has ordained
[1:36:33] for him to be be be the 47th president
[1:36:37] ain't nobody going to take him
[1:36:40] out nobody going to take him out because
[1:36:44] understand this all politics is of the
[1:36:47] devil oh I'm a

[1:38:45] politics he has to set up the stage for
[1:38:49] the tribulation he has to get men in

[1:39:07] ain't somebody's got to set the stage
[1:39:10] for a Rapture to make this country turn
[1:39:13] against Israel because God told Abraham
[1:39:16] everybody that blesses you I'll bless
[1:39:19] and everybody that curses you will be
[1:39:21] cursed there got a coming day that
[1:39:25] America will curse Israel and God has
[1:39:27] already cursed
[1:39:30] America 1963
[1:39:33] indictment brother brother said I won't

[1:39:47] Americans brother Ram said no we're
[1:39:51] Christians we are not of this World
[1:39:53] we're only in
[1:39:55] it John 17 Jesus told the father he said
[1:39:59] they are not of this
[1:40:01] world just as I am not of this
[1:40:05] world I'm a pilgrim I'm a stranger but
[1:40:08] I'm coming back to where it will be my
[1:40:12] world I I wouldn't want this world if
[1:40:14] you give it to me in the in the
[1:40:16] condition that's in right
[1:40:18] now but let the fire burn it over and we
[1:40:22] can start from
[1:40:26] scratch so this widow woman I'm going to
[1:40:28] move on this widow woman gave all that
[1:40:30] she had all her living and Jesus made a
[1:40:33] not of of this little widow woman that
[1:40:37] gave in two Ms a fifth of a
[1:40:41] penny he acknowledged her in front of
[1:40:43] all these rich men and these rich men
[1:40:45] gave way way more
[1:40:47] money but according to what they had
[1:40:50] they only gave a little
[1:40:53] they gave some but she gave
[1:40:58] all now I'm going go to a scripture
[1:41:00] that's going going to shake some of you
[1:41:01] so put your seat belt on Exodus
[1:41:18] 25 Exodus 25 verse1
[1:41:23] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:41:25] Speak unto the children of Israel that
[1:41:28] they bring me an offering of every man
[1:41:31] listen again that giveth
[1:41:36] it God ain't taking
[1:41:38] it God ain't making you cry Uncle okay
[1:41:41] okay I'll give him one the offering no
[1:41:43] it's got to be
[1:41:46] willingly of every man that giveth it
[1:41:49] willingly willingly with his heart ye
[1:41:51] shall take my offering
[1:41:54] and this is the offering which he shall
[1:41:56] take of them gold and silver and brass
[1:41:58] and he goes on all the things he took up
[1:42:01] for an offering turn to chapter 36 of
[1:42:12] Exodus verse
[1:42:14] three now Moses put certain men in
[1:42:16] charge of building certain things in the
[1:42:18] Tabernacle they were talented Carpenters
[1:42:22] or brick layers or whatever they were
[1:42:24] and he he put these men in a place to
[1:42:28] start building the t uh Tabernacle in
[1:42:30] the wilderness verse verse number
[1:42:33] three now let's start verse two Moses
[1:42:35] called Biz and a holab and every
[1:42:38] wise-hearted man in whose heart the Lord
[1:42:40] had put wisdom even everyone whose heart
[1:42:44] stirred him up to come up to uh uh unto
[1:42:48] the work to do it and they received of
[1:42:50] Moses all the offering which the
[1:42:53] children of Israel had brought for the
[1:42:55] work of the service of the sanctuary to
[1:42:57] make it with all and they brought yet
[1:43:00] unto him free
[1:43:03] offerings
[1:43:05] every
[1:43:09] morning I'll go
[1:43:11] on verse four all the wise men that
[1:43:14] wrought all the work of the sanctuary
[1:43:15] came every man from his work which they
[1:43:18] made and they spake unto Moses
[1:43:21] saying the people people bring much more
[1:43:24] than
[1:43:26] enough for the service of the Lord I
[1:43:30] have never told my people you're
[1:43:32] bringing too much
[1:43:35] money and I know he ain't
[1:43:38] either I don't know of a church under
[1:43:40] under the blue skies of Heaven that ever
[1:43:43] told their congregation stop giving off
[1:43:47] you're giv too
[1:43:51] much I guess I just need to read the
[1:43:53] Bible for
[1:43:58] you the people bring much more than
[1:44:01] enough for the service of the work which
[1:44:04] the Lord commanded to make listen and
[1:44:07] Moses gave commandment and they caused
[1:44:09] it to be proclaimed throughout the camp
[1:44:11] saying let neither man nor woman make
[1:44:14] any more work for the offering of the S
[1:44:17] Sanctuary so the the people were
[1:44:20] restrained from bringing
[1:44:25] all gave some but some gave all sounds
[1:44:28] like to me all of Israel gave
[1:44:31] all because Moses had to put a stop to
[1:44:35] taking the
[1:44:36] offering tell them hey we got enough we
[1:44:38] got enough don't bring no more
[1:44:50] offering now for when I I started the
[1:44:53] church at Pastor in 2000 March 12th 2000

[1:47:11] notes I don't make notes brother L I
[1:47:15] preached for brother Luke Gibson years
[1:47:16] ago I had a 3x5 index card on the table
[1:47:20] he he said what God's name is that I
[1:47:22] said that's my not had you he said
[1:47:23] you've lost your
[1:47:25] mind then he then he handed me his notes
[1:47:28] and it was a stack of papers about 15
[1:47:30] pages High I said my God man what do you
[1:47:33] do read it line by line he he said
[1:47:36] almost he said you can take my notes and
[1:47:39] preach my sermon I said here preach
[1:47:43] Mine He's like I ain't got that much
[1:47:45] faith
[1:47:50] brother so every now and then I I'll
[1:47:53] take a shot in my office I'll take a
[1:47:55] shot of my you know my notes for the
[1:47:57] service upcoming and I'll send it to
[1:48:01] him I said now go preach this
[1:48:07] tonight see everybody's got their own
[1:48:09] different gift Works a different way I
[1:48:12] work by the inspiration of the Holy
[1:48:14] Ghost wherever he wants me to go that's
[1:48:16] where I go this man this man preaching
[1:48:19] this morning got all kind of Limbs on
[1:48:21] the tree that's where he told me to go
[1:48:24] yeah can you imagine being in a church
[1:48:27] service for just one time and Pastor get
[1:48:30] up and say look this morning we're not
[1:48:32] taking up an offering be because
[1:48:35] everybody's giving just way too much
[1:48:38] money that's essentially what Moses said
[1:48:41] he the Bible said he restrained them
[1:48:43] from
[1:48:46] giving I wish to God that God had that
[1:48:49] idea about me he's given too much
[1:48:53] but most of the time he looks at us and
[1:48:56] say they ain't giv
[1:49:01] enough but if it's something you like
[1:49:03] something you enjoy some kind of hobby
[1:49:05] something you do you put your heart and
[1:49:08] soul into it and then you're proud of
[1:49:11] your work you're proud of what you
[1:49:14] done where's Jesus at in the whole
[1:49:18] process where have you put Gody do you
[1:49:21] really love him with all your your heart
[1:49:23] all your soul all your mind all your
[1:49:26] strength is he first seek you first the
[1:49:29] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:49:32] then he'll add all these things to
[1:49:35] you it's not that God wants you to be
[1:49:38] poor I don't believe that I got because
[1:49:42] I've got scriptures and sermons on
[1:49:44] Prosperity the right
[1:49:46] way Pro Prosperity is in the Bible you
[1:49:49] read what you s that's Pro prosperity
[1:49:53] and he that reap he that Seth
[1:49:56] bountifully reapeth bountifully he that
[1:49:59] Seth sparingly
[1:50:02] reapeth I can't you know but but Thomas
[1:50:06] I I don't know why these people drive
[1:50:09] these nice cars and I have a clunker and
[1:50:10] I have a you know not a nice house I
[1:50:13] don't have nothing well let let me see
[1:50:16] what you're giving
[1:50:18] away let me let me see the willingness
[1:50:21] of your heart
[1:50:24] to give till it
[1:50:27] hurts see the concept you have to
[1:50:30] understand here in jesus' parable about
[1:50:32] it wasn't a parable a real happening but
[1:50:34] he made it into a
[1:50:35] parable The Widow's might it wasn't
[1:50:38] about how much she
[1:50:40] gave it was what she had
[1:50:44] left see these other men could put a lot
[1:50:47] of money in because they had a lot left
[1:50:49] over but when she put hers in she had
[1:50:52] nothing left
[1:50:55] over same principle applies when Elijah
[1:50:59] went down to
[1:51:00] zerath First Kings
[1:51:03] 17 and ask the Widow for I drink of
[1:51:07] water and they're in a Fame and they're
[1:51:09] in a drought right this man caused Leisa
[1:51:13] a Ahab blamed me
[1:51:15] for go get me a drink of water as she's
[1:51:18] going he said now bring me a cake while
[1:51:20] you're at it she turns and says I only
[1:51:24] have enough for one more and me and my
[1:51:27] son are going to eat it and
[1:51:31] die so what was God required a willing
[1:51:34] heart to give her last
[1:51:37] meal and ain't so much what she gave
[1:51:40] what did she have left over nothing so
[1:51:44] then she had to completely depend on God
[1:51:48] for her
[1:51:49] needs because he prophesied you put me
[1:51:52] first God first and the meal will not
[1:51:55] run out the cruise will not run dry come
[1:51:58] on
[1:52:00] somebody until the famine was over she
[1:52:03] never ran out of meal she never ran out
[1:52:05] of oil because she she gave everything
[1:52:08] she
[1:52:13] had I want to be found faithful in
[1:52:16] giving everything when I leave service
[1:52:18] this morning I'm going to be drain dry
[1:52:21] of every ounce of energy I got and say I
[1:52:24] gave it to God I gave it to the ministry
[1:52:27] I give it to the people I held nothing
[1:52:31] back two weeks ago I was doing a prayer
[1:52:33] line at brother Donnie's and before the

[1:53:49] everything into it when I was in high
[1:53:51] school and played play ball I put 110%

[1:55:28] everybody that seen him doing it wanted
[1:55:30] to know how much the check was
[1:55:34] for you don't do you don't do things for
[1:55:37] the kingdom of God for

[1:57:51] and M musicians uh in in Notebook get
[1:57:54] their autograph so she come to me and I
[1:57:56] give it to her and I thought I was
[1:57:58] somebody I'm giving my autograph
[1:58:02] wo I'll be on TV
[1:58:05] next I'm on TV every week
[1:58:08] now it's called the
[1:58:12] internet and so I've had Brothers to
[1:58:15] come to our church from the Congo from
[1:58:17] East Africa from all kinds of different
[1:58:20] places uh you know around the world
[1:58:23] being in the states at certain times of
[1:58:25] year come and visit our church and want
[1:58:27] their picture taken with with me I it's
[1:58:31] hard for me to do that because I know as
[1:58:34] I'm preaching the word of God it's not
[1:58:35] me it's him working through
[1:58:39] me I don't want to receive none of his
[1:58:42] glory it all goes to him anything that I
[1:58:46] have ever done in my my life that's good
[1:58:49] he done it through me
[1:58:52] I take no credit for anything I've ever
[1:58:55] done in my Ministry oh brother Daniel I
[1:58:58] was at a meeting and you prayed for me
[1:58:59] and God healed you that's right God
[1:59:01] healed you it had nothing to do with me
[1:59:03] it wasn't my prayer it was your
[1:59:05] faith don't give no glory to me cuz
[1:59:09] you'll get me in trouble with God cuz he
[1:59:11] don't share it with no
[1:59:18] man we've raised up God's in the in in
[1:59:22] the message and they've become Idols of
[1:59:25] worship and some people won't even go to
[1:59:27] a certain meeting unless certain
[1:59:29] preachers is
[1:59:31] preaching see I took I took I got a word
[1:59:35] from the Lord back in January of this
[1:59:38] year and I I won't go into the details
[1:59:41] but I took six
[1:59:43] months uh I only preached two or three
[1:59:46] times uh that month January February all
[1:59:48] the way all the way through June because
[1:59:51] I was getting physically so wore down
[1:59:55] that this brother came to me and God
[1:59:57] gave him a word to me and I knew it was
[2:00:00] uh because they just diagnosed me with
[2:00:02] the S
[2:00:03] SI he he he was Balling on the phone he
[2:00:06] brother Daniel I don't know how tell you
[2:00:07] this I'm just going to tell you how it
[2:00:09] happened and after he told me I said
[2:00:12] brother I take that that's from the Lord
[2:00:13] so I took kind of uh half sabatical only
[2:00:17] preached half of the services each month
[2:00:19] from January to June trying to take a
[2:00:22] break and let me tell you something
[2:00:24] friend that it it's over now I'm full
[2:00:27] back full time again but during those
[2:00:30] six months I didn't get an ounce of
[2:00:35] rest I took it off I wasn't going to
[2:00:38] preach as
[2:00:39] much kind kind of take a break you know
[2:00:42] even Jesus did
[2:00:43] that remember he said let let's go
[2:00:46] away to get get a little rest brother
[2:00:49] brand went hunting to get take some rest
[2:00:51] well I felt like after 24 years I needed
[2:00:54] a little break cuz if you ain't careful
[2:00:56] as a pastor you burn
[2:00:58] out and then the people take the pastor
[2:01:01] for granted and the pastor takes the
[2:01:02] people for granted so let it let it go
[2:01:05] every now and then that's right let him
[2:01:08] have a break every now and
[2:01:10] then but you don't get a break from
[2:01:12] coming to
[2:01:14] church I'm going to take a break for six
[2:01:16] months from coming to church you'll be
[2:01:18] in the hail ho out there somewhere drink
[2:01:20] drinking booze
[2:01:24] but I was so I had gotten to a place to
[2:01:27] I had studied so much and been in in the
[2:01:29] word so much that you'll get burned out
[2:01:32] and then preach to the people and seems
[2:01:33] like they get worse they don't really
[2:01:37] but that's what the devil's telling you
[2:01:39] they ain't listening to you they doing
[2:01:41] what they want to do and I know some
[2:01:42] people do but if I can get a group of
[2:01:45] people brother Tom that's all
[2:01:48] Sheep No goats Among Us oh brother
[2:01:50] Daniel but brother Ram said there's
[2:01:52] three types of Believers in every church
[2:01:54] that's right but he didn't say had to
[2:01:56] stay that
[2:01:59] way because the Bible said the sheeps
[2:02:01] and the goats were together but he sent
[2:02:03] his angels to divide
[2:02:05] them I believe there's coming today that
[2:02:08] that in true message churches the
[2:02:10] shepherd will only be preaching to
[2:02:16] sheep you see I've dealt with people
[2:02:19] over the years about giving I'm get back
[2:02:21] back on money for a few minutes and just
[2:02:24] for a few minutes so take the Deep
[2:02:28] breather see God and when Abraham went
[2:02:31] down with 318 of him his soldiers went
[2:02:35] down rescued lot remember the story when
[2:02:38] lot got taken by the by the five Kings
[2:02:41] of ker laom word came to Abraham that
[2:02:44] his nephew and the family had been taken
[2:02:47] so he he armed his 318 men went down
[2:02:50] there slaughtered the king got lot and
[2:02:53] spoiled the enemy got all the spoils got
[2:02:56] you know all their stuff and on his way
[2:03:00] back home he met
[2:03:03] MDC right Genesis 14 go read it and the
[2:03:07] Bible says he gave MDC tithes of
[2:03:12] all listen to me carefully this was not
[2:03:16] his income from
[2:03:19] work this was an in
[2:03:22] increase he got this stuff from the
[2:03:25] enemy people think they only have to pay
[2:03:28] Ties on what their work gives them a
[2:03:30] paycheck no any increase if you find a
[2:03:34] $20 bill laying on the ground you better
[2:03:36] pay $2 on
[2:03:41] it the Bible says he gave a tenth of
[2:03:47] all see many people have wondered for
[2:03:51] years why aen got in so much trouble
[2:03:53] with
[2:03:54] God why aen and his family his wife his
[2:03:58] children his oxes his asses his camels
[2:04:01] every animal he had anything connected
[2:04:03] with aen was burned in the valley of aor
[2:04:06] which means the valley of trouble
[2:04:09] anything anybody connected with achen
[2:04:11] was burnt to death why why such a severe
[2:04:16] punishment because Jericho was God's
[2:04:19] tithing
[2:04:24] the first city they come from come to
[2:04:27] was
[2:04:29] Jericho oh I just blew somebody's
[2:04:33] mind go read it Joshua the first city
[2:04:37] they come to was
[2:04:41] Jericho when you get any increase the
[2:04:44] first 10% belongs to God that's right so
[2:04:48] aen essentially stole tithing from
[2:04:53] God that's why the severe punishment he
[2:04:56] didn't steal from man he stole the
[2:04:58] tithing from God because it was the
[2:05:00] first fruits of
[2:05:04] Canaan Malachi 3 says will a man rob
[2:05:13] God that's right I wonder how many
[2:05:15] people are sitting in message churches
[2:05:17] aren't being taught right about money
[2:05:20] about giving about off off and about
[2:05:23] tithing it's our responsibility as the
[2:05:26] ministers to teach you
[2:05:28] right because this is God's money you're
[2:05:32] not giving your tithe to brother
[2:05:35] Tom and it's none of your business what
[2:05:38] he spends it
[2:05:41] on CU you know he ain't boozing around
[2:05:44] with women and going he he he don't do
[2:05:46] that kind of stuff I got 100% confidence
[2:05:49] in this
[2:05:50] man come
[2:05:52] on your pastor I got 100% confidence in
[2:05:57] this man that he's living right am so
[2:05:59] when you pay off the top the first thing
[2:06:02] when get your paycheck you get birthday
[2:06:05] money you get anniversary money whatever
[2:06:07] the increase the first 10% belongs it
[2:06:11] ain't even yours it never was yours well
[2:06:14] I gave my ties to God no you didn't you
[2:06:17] gave God back his
[2:06:20] ties amen it never belonged to you in
[2:06:23] the first
[2:06:24] place and God set it up personally that
[2:06:27] way why brother Daniel because when
[2:06:30] Abraham paid tithes to MDC the Bible
[2:06:32] said Levi while yet in the Lo of Abraham
[2:06:37] paid ties while he was in seed form in
[2:06:41] his
[2:06:44] great-grandfather so God attributed the
[2:06:47] the Levites to receive tithes did you
[2:06:50] did you know when when Israel got into
[2:06:52] canaan's land the tribe of Levi did not
[2:06:56] get any
[2:06:57] inheritance not one piece of dirt was
[2:07:00] theirs but all other 11 tribes paid 10%
[2:07:05] to the tribe of Levi and that's how they
[2:07:08] lived and if everybody pays their ties
[2:07:17] right it'd be a whole lot better he' be
[2:07:21] a whole lot better better
[2:07:23] off God set it up that
[2:07:26] way so I'm a in school I was an idiot I
[2:07:30] I didn't study for anything I mean I got
[2:07:33] by like job said by the skin of my teeth
[2:07:35] I graduated by the skin of my you don't
[2:07:37] think that's in the Bible job says it by
[2:07:40] skin of your teeth I didn't say I just
[2:07:43] wanted to make a f+ D+ rather and just
[2:07:46] make it through and get out of that hell
[2:07:48] hole I hate a school and then call cused
[2:07:51] me to be a preacher and I got to St
[2:07:53] study up almost every day of my
[2:07:59] life that's what Paul told Timothy study
[2:08:02] to show th s approved oh man you mean I
[2:08:04] got a study I I thought I got out of
[2:08:06] that no so I
[2:08:09] studied um statistics again about super
[2:08:12] mega what they call mega churches in
[2:08:14] America and most of you uh even in this
[2:08:18] part of Kentucky you've probably heard
[2:08:20] of Joel ol
[2:08:22] I call him
[2:08:26] Blinky if you've ever watched him over
[2:08:28] 30 seconds you know why I call him
[2:08:31] Blinky do you know how
[2:08:34] much on one Sunday
[2:08:38] one he's got over 20 thou 25,000
[2:08:43] members on one Sunday they take up over
[2:08:46] th this is an average now sometimes more
[2:08:48] sometimes less but average one Sunday
[2:08:51] not the month of the whole month one
[2:08:53] Sunday their average offering is
[2:09:00] $600,000 on one
[2:09:04] Sunday you want to keep the lights on
[2:09:06] you want to get the nice air flowing
[2:09:08] while it's 110 degrees
[2:09:10] outside but you're expecting somebody
[2:09:12] else to pay the
[2:09:16] bill oh this is all I got
[2:09:19] uhuh that's when God blesses at the
[2:09:25] most some of you remember a man named
[2:09:28] Henry green brother Henry Green from
[2:09:29] Ruth Ruth North North Carolina okay
[2:09:32] brother Henry green was the most giving
[2:09:34] man I've ever met my my life and I
[2:09:37] learned a principle from this man about
[2:09:39] giving the law that God set up god Set
[2:09:42] this law up Galatians 5 so it whatsoever
[2:09:45] a man SWS that's what he's going to reap
[2:09:49] and this man was very blessed so people
[2:09:51] would call him wealthy I got no problem
[2:09:53] with that but how he attained his wealth
[2:09:56] was because he knew how to
[2:09:58] sow he knew how to give and this was his
[2:10:01] saying this was his uh you know whatever
[2:10:03] you call you know uh
[2:10:06] slogan when I find my resources
[2:10:09] dwindling dwindling down I look around
[2:10:13] me to see what I can give
[2:10:17] away some of y'all didn't hear that when
[2:10:20] I find my my resources start to dwindle
[2:10:24] down I look around to find something I
[2:10:28] can give
[2:10:29] away if you
[2:10:32] ever understand the true law of sewing
[2:10:34] and reaping not out of guilt not out a
[2:10:38] have to but a willing heart God loves a
[2:10:43] cheerful do you know that's the nature
[2:10:45] of God is to give for God so loved the
[2:10:48] world that he that's the nature of God
[2:10:52] God's not a taker God is a
[2:11:00] giver when you go into a relationship
[2:11:03] with God he he's not worried about what
[2:11:05] he can get out of you he he want he

[2:22:00] places he said I say that that to us
[2:22:04] today the things that we bring to him
[2:22:08] identifies what our thought is about
[2:22:13] him I'm goingon to read it again some of
[2:22:15] you is snoozing a little bit the things
[2:22:18] that we bring to him I identifies what
[2:22:21] our thoughts is about
[2:22:23] him so we've already had the song
[2:22:26] service right we've already had the time
[2:22:28] to worship
[2:22:30] God that identified you in his presence
[2:22:34] whether you worshiped or whether you
[2:22:38] didn't that tells him what you think of
[2:22:42] him that's good your gift he was talking
[2:22:46] about the wise men gold frankincense of
[2:22:48] myrr identified
[2:22:51] his livelihood what what he come on
[2:22:54] Earth to do deity and service to die
[2:22:56] their gift identified what they thought
[2:22:59] about
[2:22:59] him what is our gift telling him that we
[2:23:03] identify as a true
[2:23:06] worshipper oh uh brother Daniel I I'm
[2:23:10] I'm a real quiet person I'm I'm you know
[2:23:13] I'm backwards then then they get out on
[2:23:15] the parking lot they're the loudest one
[2:23:17] gossiping
[2:23:24] okay so you're telling me that when you
[2:23:25] get to heaven around the throne you're
[2:23:29] going to be meek and quiet and humble
[2:23:31] and say thank you
[2:23:34] Jesus they GNA be calling me Flash
[2:23:36] Gordon because I'm going be running
[2:23:37] around D with that King David
[2:23:51] Joe Crab wrote a song when it's my time
[2:23:53] I'm going to take my time when it's my
[2:23:56] time to kneel At His Feet I'm going to
[2:23:59] take my time I ain't in no hurry why do
[2:24:02] when we come to church everything has to
[2:24:04] be on a
[2:24:05] schedule so many minutes for song so
[2:24:08] many minutes for prayer requests so many
[2:24:09] minutes for the sermon so many minutes
[2:24:11] for the doxology and if we get out on
[2:24:13] time we'll be beat the Baptist to the
[2:24:14] restaurant
[2:24:21] why do we why do why do we put God in a
[2:24:23] box and say the song service only last
[2:24:26] so many specials so many uh uh
[2:24:29] congregational
[2:24:30] songs don't get a long-winded brother up
[2:24:33] there to pray he's going to pray for the
[2:24:35] governor and the the mayor and the
[2:24:37] president
[2:24:39] and well brother Ram said that but
[2:24:42] because what what we've done over the
[2:24:44] years if a man preaches over an hour all
[2:24:47] all of a sudden he gets a reputation
[2:24:51] he's long- winded how many times have
[2:24:53] you watched a movie or anything that was
[2:24:56] over an hour and you never got up to go
[2:25:09] potty it's amazing how our bladders know
[2:25:12] where we're at and what we're
[2:25:13] doing and it only bothers Us in church
[2:25:21] when you leave here this morning the
[2:25:23] question's going to be ringing in your
[2:25:25] ears what did I give him as a gift this
[2:25:30] morning it tells him who I am I'm
[2:25:34] identified by my gift do I do I want to
[2:25:38] give him my all or I want to keep
[2:25:40] somebody I want do like a can to dig in
[2:25:42] the
[2:25:43] earth and put some
[2:25:48] back cuz that's where the Babylonian
[2:25:50] garment was and the wedge of gold and
[2:25:51] piece of silver was in the earth he hid
[2:25:54] it in the earth he thought nobody knew
[2:25:57] about it I'm going to hold on to this
[2:25:59] I'm just going to do this in secrecy go
[2:26:01] off somewhere nobody knows about it you

[2:26:06] see you you're always being watched by
[2:26:09] God you ain't hiding nothing from

[2:26:39] my words all belongs to
[2:26:42] you I I don't want to be in control of
[2:26:44] nothing because I make a mess out of my
[2:26:47] life every time
[2:26:50] this is powerful friend as I Clos this
[2:26:53] down he said the things we bring to him
[2:26:57] when you came to church what did you
[2:26:58] expect to get here when you got here
[2:27:01] just another normal Sunday morning
[2:27:03] service going through the rituals
[2:27:04] traditions of men going through the
[2:27:06] motions you know exactly what Brother D
[2:27:09] David's going to do s sing this many
[2:27:12] songs you going pray call Brother B out
[2:27:15] going to have Sunday school all the
[2:27:16] things in order and it becomes a ritual
[2:27:20] a tradition of the
[2:27:22] elders so so you can go ahead and make
[2:27:25] reservations at the buffet because you
[2:27:28] know about how long the service is
[2:27:29] supposed to
[2:27:31] last what about when God gets
[2:27:36] involved and the Holy Ghost
[2:27:40] Falls you ain't going to look at your
[2:27:42] watch
[2:27:47] then things we bring to him Iden ifies
[2:27:50] what our thought is about him he said
[2:27:53] you understand what I mean if you
[2:27:55] believe with all your heart every word
[2:27:56] of that you'll identify it by giving all
[2:28:00] that you have to it you remember I Clos
[2:28:03] and you remember when the Queen of Sheba
[2:28:05] went to meet
[2:28:07] Solomon go read this go go read the
[2:28:10] passage of scripture and I did the math
[2:28:12] I I don't remember the exact number but
[2:28:14] as well into the millions of dollar
[2:28:16] dollar that she gave to solom as a gift
[2:28:20] as an offering she had heard so many
[2:28:22] things about this wise man so she wanted
[2:28:25] to see for herself and she brought gifts
[2:28:29] to to
[2:28:33] identify what she expected to see when
[2:28:35] she got there she didn't go there
[2:28:38] empty-handed you don't come to church
[2:28:41] just to see what you can get from God
[2:28:43] what can you give to
[2:28:46] him your worship means everything to him
[2:28:50] because if we don't worship him he's not
[2:28:52] God God is an object of worship and if
[2:28:55] we don't worship him he he's not
[2:29:00] God we got so many things in leosia Rich
[2:29:03] and increase with good have need of
[2:29:07] nothing we we've got something for
[2:29:10] everything we've got resources we can
[2:29:11] pull from God's nowhere what what if we
[2:29:16] was in a third world country and needed
[2:29:18] a loan and needed you know food needed
[2:29:20] this where you going to go there's no
[2:29:22] resources then then people have to have
[2:29:27] faith in America we we don't really need
[2:29:30] Faith because we got so many resources
[2:29:33] to pull from people are making millions
[2:29:36] off of
[2:29:36] YouTube kids making millions off
[2:29:41] Instagram this generation Z don't even
[2:29:43] know x z whatever it is they don't know
[2:29:47] uh about dirt under their fingernails
[2:29:50] callous hands the only calluses they
[2:29:53] have is on their thumbs from
[2:29:57] texting
[2:29:59] huh but let me take up for the Youth for
[2:30:02] for just a second it ain't the youth's
[2:30:05] fault it's parent
[2:30:11] delinquency time to grab the Hickory
[2:30:15] again my Bible tells me if you beat him
[2:30:18] with a rod he won't die
[2:30:22] oh but brother Daniel we're we're more
[2:30:24] civilized than that
[2:30:26] really the man this man right here is a
[2:30:30] product of a
[2:30:33] belt the only time out my dad knew
[2:30:37] about was while he was whipping me he
[2:30:41] took a
[2:30:43] breather he took time out and then start
[2:30:46] am mening whipping me
[2:30:48] again I wasn't crying loud
[2:30:52] enough cuz you know if you have if you
[2:30:55] have an advanced notice on your whipping
[2:30:57] you go put seven pairs of underwear
[2:31:02] on well somehow dad has a little bit or
[2:31:05] mom has a little bit of
[2:31:07] discernment and they go a little
[2:31:12] lower and on the back side of your
[2:31:15] hamstring oh
[2:31:18] Jesus oh God how it hurts a little bit
[2:31:22] higher mom a little bit higher then they
[2:31:25] get down to the calves cuz you're moving
[2:31:27] around then jumping around jump from bed
[2:31:29] to bed hanging from Chandelier jumping
[2:31:31] from bench to bench trying to get right
[2:31:33] from that bed D Daddy just stand there
[2:31:36] in the middle I got I I I got to come
[2:31:37] back to him
[2:31:39] eventually he just wait on me son you
[2:31:42] it's getting more licked the more you
[2:31:44] act stupid more licks you going to get
[2:31:48] come over here bend over the bed and
[2:31:49] take it like a man I ain't a man I know
[2:31:51] that's why I'm whipping
[2:31:56] you cuz this generation knows no
[2:31:59] consequence for the things they're
[2:32:02] doing they get off with
[2:32:04] everything parents don't correct them
[2:32:07] police don't give them a ticket the the
[2:32:09] government lets them out of jail there's
[2:32:11] no
[2:32:14] consequence so if you think there's no
[2:32:17] consequence go ahead and do it
[2:32:21] but the generation I grew up in there
[2:32:23] was consequences for wrongdoing for
[2:32:26] sinful
[2:32:27] living and you prayed they wouldn't find
[2:32:31] out cuz you you knew the consequences my
[2:32:35] daddy told me because back then in the
[2:32:37] 80s if you uh they they still paddled
[2:32:40] kids at
[2:32:43] school yeah see he was raised the same
[2:32:46] way I was my daddy looked at me said boy
[2:32:49] you get one home soon as you get home
[2:32:51] you get another
[2:32:54] one and amen it yeah and the reason that
[2:32:58] I I never went out in the world never
[2:33:00] been drunk never been stoned never been
[2:33:01] out in the world with wild women bars
[2:33:04] and all that kind of stuff CU Mom and
[2:33:08] Daddy corrected
[2:33:09] me I KN knew there was consequences to
[2:33:13] wrongdoing the reason this generation
[2:33:15] has gone wild nuts free tearing down
[2:33:19] stat stes destroying Parks destroying
[2:33:21] monuments and all kinds of what what
[2:33:24] kind of people do this they're out of
[2:33:25] their mind it's because of parent even
[2:33:28] brother Bram said about those kids of 42
[2:33:31] children that the she Bears
[2:33:33] killed that Elisha called out was be
[2:33:36] because they heard their parents talking
[2:33:38] about Elisha calling calling him that
[2:33:41] old
[2:33:42] Baldhead where are these young people
[2:33:44] getting these ideas from where they get
[2:33:48] eight years old all of a sudden boy says
[2:33:50] I want to be a
[2:33:52] girl my dad would have knocked me from
[2:33:54] one end of the trailer to the
[2:33:57] other boy you was born a boy and you're
[2:34:00] going to die a boy and if you say it
[2:34:02] again you might die
[2:34:06] today I brought you into this world
[2:34:08] bless God I can take you out of this
[2:34:11] world but the people the parents today
[2:34:14] are endorsing it asking the kids they're
[2:34:17] born a certain gender ask you you you
[2:34:19] want want to remain a boy do you want to
[2:34:21] remain a girl we'll pay for the
[2:34:24] surgery what kind of morons what kind of
[2:34:29] insanity that all all of us are rubbing
[2:34:32] shoulders
[2:34:34] with if if if ever there was a time we
[2:34:37] need to be closer to God than ever it's
[2:34:40] right now
[2:34:44] [Applause]
[2:34:58] 20 years ago You' never you'd NE never
[2:35:02] made me believe we'd be facing the
[2:35:03] things we're facing right now never in a
[2:35:06] million years what I have
[2:35:08] believed because I'm going to tell you
[2:35:10] friend when when my mom was pregnant
[2:35:13] with me in I was born in
[2:35:17] 1970 and back back
[2:35:20] then they was under a Pentecostal Pastor
[2:35:23] that didn't believe in doctors and
[2:35:24] Medicine stuff like that so I was born
[2:35:25] at home with a
[2:35:28] midwife so my mom didn't have all the
[2:35:31] prenatal stuff and all the stuff that
[2:35:33] women have today and so when I was born
[2:35:35] into this world um my mom B birthed my
[2:35:39] older brother and myself at home so she
[2:35:42] she didn't have the you know child care
[2:35:44] and stuff like that uh that people have
[2:35:47] today and so and I came into this world
[2:35:51] and I was raised you know from birth all
[2:35:54] my life from the time I was birthed till
[2:35:57] right now I've been in
[2:36:01] church never one time in my life have I
[2:36:05] left church you know what I'm saying for
[2:36:08] a season like some people do just leave
[2:36:10] church and go out in the world I've
[2:36:12] never went out in the world done things
[2:36:13] the world I've done things that were
[2:36:14] wrong I'm not perfect you get you get my
[2:36:17] drift people sitting in pews still
[2:36:19] seeing you know make
[2:36:23] mistakes I never claimed to be a perfect
[2:36:25] man but I claim the
[2:36:28] blood but there come a time in my life
[2:36:31] I've seen my mama's uh relationship with
[2:36:34] the Lord I've seen my daddy's
[2:36:35] relationship with the Lord I had true
[2:36:38] examples in my home of what Christians
[2:36:40] really
[2:36:42] were my mom would come and me their
[2:36:46] bedroom was on one end of the trailer me
[2:36:48] and Jonathan's bedroom was on the other
[2:36:51] friend up up until I was about 15 16
[2:36:54] years old my mother would come and cross
[2:36:57] her legs Indian style and sit in the
[2:36:59] floor between Jonathan and my room and
[2:37:01] sit in the floor and pray all night
[2:37:04] long I would wake up in the middle of
[2:37:06] the night hearing my mother praying in
[2:37:13] tongues and now we
[2:37:17] see most Christians day a according to
[2:37:20] statistics the only prayers they have
[2:37:22] during the week is over their
[2:37:29] food preachers are resigning left and
[2:37:33] right because of a preacher's life can
[2:37:36] be a very lonely
[2:37:39] life everybody looks up to the preacher
[2:37:42] but it's sometimes could be a very
[2:37:44] lonely life you can be at the top be the
[2:37:49] head
[2:37:50] be the one that calls the shots it ain't
[2:37:52] all that's cracked up to
[2:37:53] be because with that position brings
[2:37:56] great
[2:37:58] responsibility see not only do pastors
[2:38:01] have to give an account for their
[2:38:03] home they give an account for yours
[2:38:06] too everybody that sits under that man
[2:38:09] he gives an account for the entire flock
[2:38:12] to be the door to the flock to represent
[2:38:16] Jesus John chapter 10 the great door
[2:38:19] read represent Jeremiah 23 God said I
[2:38:23] will send you pastors according to my
[2:38:26] heart and the responsibility that goes
[2:38:29] along with that's what's wrong with to
[2:38:31] with today's generation they don't want
[2:38:35] responsibility they want to make the
[2:38:36] baby but they don't want to take care of
[2:38:38] the
[2:38:40] baby see they'll give some but not all
[2:38:44] it's easy for all to give some if we
[2:38:46] took an offering right now probably most
[2:38:49] of you you would get
[2:38:51] something there might be one here this
[2:38:53] morning that you need to give all
[2:38:55] spiritually you just G him a piece of
[2:38:58] your heart a piece of your heart see
[2:39:00] doors and door 1961 brother brother said
[2:39:04] if he's not Lord of all he's not Lord at
[2:39:07] all you got to open every
[2:39:10] door surrender everything to
[2:39:15] him I was telling brother Joe this story
[2:39:18] and I'll end with this
[2:39:21] back in 2012 12 after I broke my back
[2:39:23] and recovered through rehab I was
[2:39:26] preaching a meeting a youth
[2:39:30] camp and don't don't everybody don't get
[2:39:33] nervous some of you probably hear
[2:39:36] something like this for the first time
[2:39:37] but don't get nerves okay uh God still
[2:39:42] got everything under control we had
[2:39:44] altar with slap full from one side of
[2:39:46] the building to the other I don't know
[2:39:48] how many kids I prayed for
[2:39:51] and I was done I was spent not a dry
[2:39:55] place on me when I walked my shoes were
[2:39:57] squishing from
[2:39:59] sweat I'm went back to the back of the
[2:40:02] pool uh platform to sit down sit down
[2:40:04] for a
[2:40:05] minute while uh some of the other
[2:40:08] ministers were ministering to the young
[2:40:09] people and all of a sudden this demon
[2:40:12] manifested itself in this 15y old
[2:40:15] girl and she started talking in deep
[2:40:18] voice like a man
[2:40:21] and I knew what I knew what it was cuz I
[2:40:23] had had not not been directly uh
[2:40:27] connected with that but I'd seen it done
[2:40:29] two times in my
[2:40:31] life
[2:40:33] and you know Mom didn't W raise no fool
[2:40:37] I I ain't the sharpest knife in the
[2:40:39] drawer but I'm in the drawer y'all feel
[2:40:41] me I ain't the sharpest knife but I
[2:40:44] ain't no idiot either you don't do
[2:40:46] something unless God tells you to do it
[2:40:48] when you dealing with demons like that
[2:40:50] you better know God sent you you go to
[2:40:53] you know go to other countries or witch
[2:40:56] doctors and sorcery and all that Stu
[2:40:58] kind of stuff goes on you you better
[2:41:00] know beyond the shadow of that God God's
[2:41:02] with you you get yourself in a mess of
[2:41:05] trouble so I wouldn't go down there then
[2:41:07] my other brothers were praying with her
[2:41:08] I wouldn't go down there and that and I
[2:41:10] was a speaker that night I'd already
[2:41:12] preached so I went back and uh to the
[2:41:16] back of the platform and I just stood
[2:41:17] there and watching them pray for cuz I
[2:41:19] would going to go go down there unless
[2:41:21] God told me to and all of a sudden I'll
[2:41:24] Stand Before the Throne of God telling
[2:41:26] you the honest truth I felt two hands on
[2:41:28] my shoulder blades push
[2:41:31] me and I looked behind me I thought who
[2:41:34] who who's pushing me not a soul behind
[2:41:37] me I said okay Lord I'll
[2:41:43] go I walked down them
[2:41:45] steps the girl's eyes were rolled back
[2:41:48] in her head you can see the white of her
[2:41:49] eyes only she spit at me she tried to
[2:41:52] bite me it was all I could do I was 5'
[2:41:55] 10 and a half weigh 180 200 lbs going to
[2:41:59] the gym three times a week this this
[2:42:01] this is before all my surgeries and
[2:42:04] fairely stout young man back then is all
[2:42:07] I could do to hold that girl's skinny
[2:42:09] little arms remember what brother brand
[2:42:12] said about demon-possessed people they
[2:42:15] have the strength of 10 men is all I
[2:42:18] could do to hold her hand she was trying
[2:42:20] to hit me and choke me and spit at I
[2:42:23] just barely missed her spit spit right
[2:42:25] by
[2:42:26] me trying to bite
[2:42:29] me
[2:42:31] so I knew it you know I've been
[2:42:35] preaching for 10
[2:42:37] years uh no 12 13 years at the time
[2:42:41] pastoring
[2:42:43] 12 so I looked at her I was trying to
[2:42:46] get her attention because I knew the
[2:42:47] demon had possessed her it it it had
[2:42:51] taken over her like the Holy Ghost takes
[2:42:54] over
[2:42:57] Believers the devil ain't got the
[2:42:59] Monopoly on possessing people she was
[2:43:02] doing what the devil in her was making
[2:43:04] her
[2:43:05] do it was the demon that I was talking
[2:43:08] to I was dealing with not her so I
[2:43:10] looked I I asked some somebody around me
[2:43:12] I said what's her name tell me her name
[2:43:15] so they tell me what it was I don't
[2:43:17] remember uh what her her name was but
[2:43:19] any I called her by her name and she was
[2:43:22] wrestling and she was fighting and she
[2:43:24] was struggling and when I called her
[2:43:26] name she stopped and her eyes came back
[2:43:28] down and she looked at me and I call as
[2:43:32] I called her name she said yes I said do
[2:43:36] you
[2:43:37] want to be
[2:43:41] delivered and she said in her voice she
[2:43:43] said in in a female voice she said yes
[2:43:47] right behind that that demon said
[2:43:51] no this is what I did cuz see the
[2:43:55] anointing is not
[2:43:57] emotions direct quote the anointing is
[2:44:00] not emotions it's supreme power in
[2:44:03] control and I knew God had sent me down
[2:44:06] there so I was not
[2:44:10] alone so when I said do you want to be
[2:44:13] delivered she said yes that demon said
[2:44:15] no I said you shut up I ain't talking to
[2:44:18] you
[2:44:20] God bear record one day it's on it's on
[2:44:24] his record that's exactly what I told
[2:44:25] that de devil you shut up I ain't
[2:44:28] talking to you I said
[2:44:30] sis do you want remember a willing
[2:44:34] offering a willing heart you have to
[2:44:37] want it for him to give it to you he's
[2:44:40] not going to force it on
[2:44:43] you the second time in in her natural
[2:44:47] voice female voice she said yes and then
[2:44:49] again the devil said
[2:44:52] no I said I thought I told you to shut
[2:44:54] up I'm not talking to you I'm talking to
[2:44:57] her and she said she wants to be
[2:45:00] delivered so guess what devil you've got
[2:45:03] to
[2:45:12] go and I had remembered when Jesus met
[2:45:16] Legion on the shores of gadera after
[2:45:19] crossing the sea with the storm you know
[2:45:21] the
[2:45:22] story Jesus didn't have a prayer meeting
[2:45:25] he didn't have time to fast all he said
[2:45:29] was come
[2:45:30] out and I remember that so I told that
[2:45:34] demon I said come
[2:45:35] out in Jesus
[2:45:38] name come out in Jesus name and
[2:45:41] something inspired me and I got back on
[2:45:44] the platform about this High and a
[2:45:47] brother was singing I said could I say
[2:45:49] something just for a second he said sure
[2:45:52] brother Daniel so I said I told the the
[2:45:56] group of young people in the audience I
[2:45:58] I I said on the count of three we gonna
[2:46:00] say the name of Jesus five times every
[2:46:03] one of us say Jesus five times one two
[2:46:06] three Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus and the
[2:46:12] whole time we're we're calling out that
[2:46:14] name that devil is going absolutely nuts
[2:46:17] no no don't call that name no don't call
[2:46:20] that
[2:46:21] name so I went back down there after
[2:46:24] that and I got that demon to look look
[2:46:27] through her eyes at me some some me I
[2:46:30] ain't going to believe this I really
[2:46:31] don't care and I said all right big boy
[2:46:35] who do you see in front of
[2:46:38] you and in a man's deep grup voice this
[2:46:41] demon said
[2:46:45] Jesus I said who do you see before you
[2:46:49] he said Jesus I said that's exactly
[2:46:51] right I am his
[2:46:54] representation so I have the authority
[2:46:56] to cast you out boom demon leaves
[2:47:08] her I told you that to to make this
[2:47:11] point she had been dabbling on the inter
[2:47:14] internet on things she shouldn't have
[2:47:16] been dabbling with entertaining things
[2:47:18] she said shouldn't been
[2:47:21] entertained and so she was given her all
[2:47:24] into this
[2:47:27] lifestyle by doing
[2:47:29] that that opened a door for that demon
[2:47:32] to enter into her because she was given
[2:47:35] her all to
[2:47:37] it but when she declared I want deliver
[2:47:41] that that opened another
[2:47:44] door well Glory
[2:47:50] I wanted her to declare I want
[2:47:53] Deliverance the devil was done after
[2:47:57] that if Jesus knows from your heart you
[2:48:01] want to be delivered there ain't enough
[2:48:03] devils in hell that can keep you
[2:48:15] bound friend I prayed for drug addicts I
[2:48:18] prayed for alcoholics I prayed for
[2:48:19] people off the streets I know what they
[2:48:22] deal with I've seen them I I I've worked
[2:48:25] with them I pray prayed with them it's a
[2:48:28] pitiful
[2:48:30] sight and it's a horrible de demon that
[2:48:33] I
[2:48:34] despise CU I want to say I want to see
[2:48:37] this same person turn their life around
[2:48:40] by the Holy Ghost and put as much energy
[2:48:44] into the word of God as they do into the
[2:48:47] drugs that's right if you're going to
[2:48:49] give everything to the devil why you
[2:48:51] can't you give everything to God when
[2:48:54] you was out in the world you gave
[2:48:55] everything to the devil whatever he told
[2:48:57] you to do you done it wherever he told
[2:48:59] you to go if you had the money you went
[2:49:02] what about the word of
[2:49:05] God I don't want to just give some I
[2:49:08] want to give my

[2:49:26] praise with

[2:50:03] midst so while he's here because we know

[2:50:22] but see some people have to be pushed
[2:50:25] all the way to
[2:50:27] desperation because they're so
[2:50:29] bound remember I some of you still
[2:50:33] pulling so I can't quit
[2:50:35] yet remember when the maniac in Portland
[2:50:38] Oregon come on the platform with brother
[2:50:40] Rand had done broke a preacher's
[2:50:44] jaw escaped out of mental
[2:50:46] institution come up there
[2:50:49] right Toe to Toe with brother BR a place
[2:50:53] where he could have got his
[2:50:55] Deliverance come on that's right brother
[2:50:58] random could have just spoke Deliverance
[2:51:00] as a Vindicated prophet and if that man
[2:51:03] had a wanted Deliverance that demon had
[2:51:05] to leave but he didn't take advantage of
[2:51:08] the
[2:51:12] opportunity he called him a snake in the
[2:51:14] grass and taught him you bring up the
[2:51:16] wrong tree which is a lion Hound do
[2:51:20] and brother randam said you'll fall over
[2:51:22] my my feet the remember the police

[2:51:58] man he said it friend I've been in this
[2:52:01] message a long time I heard a lot of
[2:52:03] tapes I know what he said he said Satan
[2:52:05] come out of the man but Satan didn't
[2:52:08] come out of the man why that man
[2:52:10] worshiped that devil so he didn't have
[2:52:14] to obey brother B's voice because the

[2:55:15] Lord Heavenly Father
[2:55:26] I was up at 4 something this morning
[2:55:28] couldn't
[2:55:30] sleep try to find your mind and your
[2:55:33] will for the
[2:55:34] service which direction
[2:55:37] go easier than others to
[2:55:42] get I'm preach it sometimes we have to
[2:55:45] wrestle and wrestle
[2:55:49] all through the night
[2:55:52] Lord I tossed and I turned and got up
[2:55:55] and laid back down got up I couldn't
[2:56:02] rest so I just begin to meditate on you
[2:56:06] in the service this morning God what do
[2:56:08] you want me to say I don't want to
[2:56:11] offend nobody I want to be too crude too
[2:56:13] rude I but I want to tell them the truth
[2:56:16] it's my duty to tell them the truth it
[2:56:21] not whitewash it not compromise they
[2:56:24] need the truth because only the truth
[2:56:27] can make them
[2:56:32] free and now I know after
[2:56:36] the
[2:56:38] E somehow I
[2:56:42] found I found your will for this
[2:56:46] service and it wasn't what I was going
[2:56:48] to preach Friday night when brother Tom
[2:56:50] asked
[2:56:51] me I thought of another S I would just
[2:56:53] go this way you know
[2:56:59] when last night you was trying your best
[2:57:02] to change me and you
[2:57:05] did I thought
[2:57:08] Lord preach that in
[2:57:12] another I
[2:57:15] don't long or in but I want to tell the
[2:57:19] TR truth as you give me the
[2:57:21] truth and you every hand that was raised
[2:57:26] in your
[2:57:27] presence no doubt God I believe from
[2:57:31] Honest
[2:57:34] Hearts they didn't raise them to
[2:57:36] me I didn't see every hand but you did
[2:57:40] and more importantly you seen the
[2:57:43] heart behind the
[2:57:46] hand and father there's one thing I know
[2:57:48] about
[2:57:50] you that if people would just come as
[2:57:52] they are you'll receive
[2:57:55] them when the covered in mud and manure
[2:57:59] and all kinds of
[2:58:03] fings but far off he
[2:58:06] ran and embraced him he didn't care he
[2:58:09] was covered in piger and mud and
[2:58:11] everything else he Embrace
[2:58:13] him maybe there's that that one this
[2:58:16] morning that's coming home maybe there's
[2:58:19] half a dozen I don't know
[2:58:21] God you you're the one that looks at the
[2:58:23] heart but I know you spoke to people
[2:58:25] this
[2:58:27] morning by the effect of the
[2:58:30] sermon of people
[2:58:35] responding God I'm praying right
[2:58:38] now that you would condescend Beyond
[2:58:41] flesh and
[2:58:42] Bone Beyond blood and blood vessels
[2:58:46] beyond the organs of the body and go
[2:58:48] go to the soul of the man go to the soul
[2:58:51] of the woman and do the work that needs
[2:58:54] to be done as they open every door of
[2:58:57] their heart to you and surrender
[2:59:00] everything and lay it at your feet
[2:59:03] because my Bible tells me cast all your
[2:59:05] care on him for he carth for
[2:59:11] you sometimes Lord we think we don't
[2:59:14] have a friend in the world but there is
[2:59:16] a friend that sticketh closer than a
[2:59:22] brother even my down times and my bad
[2:59:25] times and the times I wasn't where I
[2:59:27] needed to be
[2:59:30] you people here never left
[2:59:33] them wherever they was at whatever they
[2:59:35] was doing you was right there with
[2:59:38] them protecting that seed watching over
[2:59:40] that
[2:59:41] seed bringing certain people in their P
[2:59:44] Pathway to meet this person and meet
[2:59:47] this person
[2:59:48] so they can eventually get on the
[2:59:50] straight and narrow pathway that leads
[2:59:52] to eternal
[2:59:54] life every hand that was raised may
[2:59:57] maybe even the streaming God bless them
[2:59:59] as well do the work that needs to be
[3:00:01] done through every heart every hand that
[3:00:04] was
[3:00:05] uplifted I've done my part now
[3:00:09] father it's your turn to do your part if
[3:00:13] I could change them if I could do what
[3:00:15] needs to be done I'd stay here all day
[3:00:18] and do
[3:00:19] it but my part is to preach the
[3:00:24] gospel and the power and demonstration
[3:00:26] of the Holy Ghost and no doubt father
[3:00:29] this morning the word
[3:00:33] hearts and let people
[3:00:35] know yes I can give
[3:00:40] some but can I
[3:00:45] give rich and increased with good
[3:00:49] incre and have need of nothing and at
[3:00:52] the same time they're miserable
[3:00:56] wretched
[3:00:58] or know
[3:01:00] it so God I pray you touch hand every
[3:01:03] heart that was uplifted this
[3:01:06] morning may this church and brother Tom
[3:01:08] receive the testimonies coming back that
[3:01:12] something happened that Sunday
[3:01:14] morning I've never been the same since

[3:01:19] came down as I raised my hands in
[3:01:21] syringes to God he came down and did the
[3:01:24] work that needed to be
[3:01:27] done I give this crowd this audience to
[3:01:30] you God do the work because we're
[3:01:33] looking to you the author and the
[3:01:36] finisher of our
[3:01:38] faith would you grant it this
