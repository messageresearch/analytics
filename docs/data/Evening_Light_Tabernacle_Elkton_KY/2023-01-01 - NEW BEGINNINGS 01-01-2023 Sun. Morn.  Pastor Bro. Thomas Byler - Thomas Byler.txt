NEW BEGINNINGS 01-01-2023 Sun. Morn. / Pastor Bro. Thomas Byler
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
which are behind and reaching forth unto those things with the calling of God what's the meaning of the word you can come to my mind to think about Paul speaking here about two things here amen and that is forgetting those things that are in the past isn't that right or that are behind us amen and as we know that and and maybe Wednesday I don't know if the Lord will just inspire me to go that way this coming Wednesday but we may talk about uh being Eternal creatures amen creatures of Eternity Amen brother bam said a lot about that we make over that but this morning I want to talk more about us as creatures of time amen and in our natural realm we know that we have times and Seasons like Ecclesiastes says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven there's a time to be born a time to die a time to plant in other words there's a beginning there's an end just about everything there's a beginning and there is an end amen amen to time the plant and so forth now notice verse 10 you know because to me to me keeping up with this a lot of times uh you know there's a lot of so many different Beginnings there's so many different endings isn't it right uh that it's a lot to keep up with uh Solomon said in verse 10's I have seen after he talks about all these things he says I've seen the true Veil The which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised by that by that in so many things that we do even in the beginning and the end amen that it begins and it be it becomes and is a travail amen and so uh also you know the the one one of the first places that we find the a a a a a beginning was of course in Genesis when God said with the very first verse that he ever wrote was he said in the beginning Amen in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth then the prophet of God stated anything that has a beginning that's right has an end anything that has a begin in the end how many knows shall be an end to this world it'll change from one thing to another amen everything that is a beginning has an end and that's why I like to think about what God and the Holy Spirit is and us as Mortals amen us as Mortals we have a there's uh we have a beginning and uh let me just ask you this quiz question this morning a little bit uh when did you start when do we start conception at Birth somebody's at the foundation of the world okay well let me just read what the prophet of God says now notice he says God has allotted that his scripture from the beginning now notice he says in these talking about something else here for a minute we'll get to the point but let me pick this up while we're on it before there was any time notice he is the Eternal one these things happening now are only the attributes of God's thinking at first it has to be a thought man and then a word when they thought is expressed it becomes a word and then when it's spoken it has to happen not yours or mine but God's we can think anything and you might say I'm going to do this tomorrow we may be taking you seeing you at the funeral tomorrow we don't know that right but with God when he thinks something and when he says something it has to happen you can count on it let me just like I said you know whenever you go through these things and the holy spirit's dealing with you it's just amazing the things that pull in but I don't want to go on too much of something other but it still fits in and that is when he said that God a lot of scriptures how many knows that he had a lot of scriptures for every age including our age the whole history of the world God has already wrote it all out amen the whole mind when you think about the the main thing that we think about when we think about the allotted word that's been wrote was the seven Church ages in the first three chapters of Revelation he knew what each age would do what they would go through and how they would have to give their lives now they would be killed isn't that right he says be thou faithful unto death he knew they would die you know and so forth all of it all the way down to lyanna see originally creates with good and so forth but not in Revelations 18 he talked about that being an angel calling us up out of there amen praise be to God how many is glad doesn't that do something to you know you're not part of the layout is here but you're part of the ones that are called out if you can see yourself in that part of the word you ought to have a hard time keeping your bench why because if you're on the bad side I'll tell you what there ain't nothing to be happy about man one time two men came out of the meeting up by the bantams they listen to him preach on the eagle and the Buzzard and he said he called me a buzzard ah another guy says really he called me an eagle it just depends on how perceiving what you are what it identified you oh Mom when I think about the revelation of God and what he just shows us and what we know and how how that make you happy to know who you are and what you are amen here's a lot of this word to every Asian we have to be a part we have to be a part of that word and if you are a part of that word that means that you were part of his thoughts before not at the foundation but before the foundation of the world before I never let the first word like that he had thought of you huh before that because you know I got the writing this down about well our first beginning was at conception or our beginning was at first you know because that's when you take the Breath of Life That's when your life begins and we know the Bible says you know before you was born I knew you into your mother's womb booms so I guess but God mothers woman I thought you know that was still not our beginning I begin to think about the prophet of God said and he says you know Therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life you can't have it any other way you won't have it any other way if you weren't part of that thinking but the man says you don't even stand a chance there's no way that you're ever going to be there if you wasn't in that thinking because he wrote your name down in the book of life before the foundation of the world and that's what he came to do he came to redeem those pains that were on the book by the man says and he says when that last name is redeemed he's going to come and receive his purchase possession amen you talk about a beginning ah and you know that's the glory of it foreign that's the most glorious beginning was to have been in his thoughts amen praise the Lord your name amen that's how you have eternal life otherwise you you can't just can't say well I belong to church I knew this and the kingdom of man at the beginning is always enthusiasm and it's always great and it's always wonderful you know most is out and if that's the kingdoms governments think about America how we work how we thrived and looking at the glory [Applause] even Trump said uh make America great again sometimes at one time Terry there wasn't a government in the world could defeat us not Japan but at the end notice how that was at the beginning now at the end is always sad just the life that we live we get to be 20 years old we can't move our hands can't move our legs hey man you're so weak we can't do anything anymore amen and we take the last breath that we die it's a sad story start straight anything normally mortal starts great anybody that has any gills huh oh I'm gonna do this this is gonna be wonderful this is gonna be great time it all faces a lot we all been there amen kingdoms oh my brother bam says in one of his message we're standing tonight upon the Bremen watching come to pass for two great teens and those two great teams are these one of them is the ending of History other than the one they use the ending of time and many great mating men down Through the Ages have long to see this hour that we are now approaching amen Micah turn this one on would you well turn this one on a little bit there's something I wanted to play and I was listening to it and I'm going to kind of just I try to keep my thought here two things here but there's something I wanted to play brother bam said and it's concerning our future concerning the coming year and so forth and he was preaching on the Feast of the trumpets 1963. I thought that it should be our goal because one place he said um let me just see if I can pull that one quote up where he makes a statement I don't mean it to be that way but I believe that we're living at the closing close so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus that I have to take every advantage of every minute that I have when I have the people together so pick that out when he speaks then he talks about our assembling together and the privilege that is and so forth so now we're going to try to I'm going to go back 10 seconds and see where we're at all right ready I don't I mean it to be that I believe that we're living at so close to the coming of Jesus that I have to take advantage should have been a minute the people together and I was thinking I was just driving out a while ago being out for a little prayer just for entering the pulpit is any real sincere clergymen does I was thinking um you know we're having the most glorious time when we meet here together that's right and the people Gathering From many states right in here now from where from way away hundreds and hundreds of miles and we have SIMPLE together to but there will come a time soon when this will be just upon memory that is right these times will be taken away from us so therefore we must do that we know how to do to make this every minute now amen how many believe that so you know in this coming year I don't really look for greater uh liberties politically no I've expected to go the other direction even the brother bam talked about what we do this morning be a fond memory so don't expect that to happen but what we do but about him he says you know we come together and people think that we're coming together he talked to used to use it people think we're coming back for eternity or something he says well I just preached it long but then it makes a statement I'm trying to take long and I'm trying to take every opportunity when we have the people together to do all that we can for the kingdom of God Amen praise the Lord so let's go back on our thought amen because that's what we want to do are you with me just coming here let's do all that we can for the kingdom of God that's the only thing that counts the only thing that matters amen I'm going to say something else comes to mind you know in the last few service and and so forth now with when the preachers preaching and everybody gets into disservice I like that amen and when he says something that's worthwhile you know I noticed it with Brother Brad preaching and so forth you know people applaud and applaud the word of God not the man of God but the word of God Amen and I like to see that happen and let's keep going that way amen don't let the spirit dampen and so forth let's keep pressing right on amen Hallelujah so we think about these things that's happening now they're only in attributes of God's thinking you know it was a had to be a word first amen before it was a thought amen so we see not many Fitness just thought about how that if you have eternal life you can't have it no other way I mean it had to be with him then there's only one eternal life and it always existed and you now here's wherever the punch line and you in his mind existed amen and his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason that he said he chose you before the foundation of the world Ill Mind it isn't what we think or somebody else thinks it's what God thinks hey man I mean it's that it's not what you make yourself or try to make yourself or the choices you make you realize that God knew that you would choose that and he put that into you to be able to choose it it was him all along it's it's okay that has begun I got you he has started give us the beginning he started to work in you what is he gonna do he's gonna go through the middle of it if they gives you trials and tribulations but he's gonna take you through he says he will also perform it oh my every other kingdom is gonna fall the kingdom hypocrisy you boy I'll tell you what it gets my goat not only get political but the ones that's called others Liars are the liars isn't that right and nobody sees it just like nobody sees it nobody don't believe anything you're just because like brother dance says please Chase something you're not fine people are believing not diesel oh boy lies a lie amen but oh my buddies falling but aren't you glad that you received I have received a kingdom that shall never pass away Hallelujah all Earthly kingdoms fall there have been so many starts and so many stops but to this there's not gonna be any stopping amen praise God we have all kinds of different places that we start we start when we take that first breath we wait for that first time that that maybe I'll take the first step oh no we're so happy as parents when that little one takes that first step but then what from there so oh did you hear what he said it's she said Mommy first or she said mommy or daddy first oh we always look for the first word coming on I'm always looking for this first thing the beginning of so many things first day of school huh or get married the first day of marriage not glorious and it's a honeymoon for a while is that right and you gotta go through that and let me tell you something how many beliefs that you got to work at keeping your marriage a honeymoon that's right because the devil tries to get in there and destroy it oh my so many things praise the Lord first walk marriage and so forth but listen it all comes to an end all will comes to oh it comes to not so many things come to not but not when God does something men praise be to God now notice this is what mother Brown said here in um Shalom I believe in boss he said we don't we're not the kind of people that look back no because you're going to wreck up if you do notice we are not we're looking forward to see where we're going see that which is in the past Paul said we're forgetting those things which you are in the past we press our smart for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus and that's what we want to do amen praise the Lord that's what I'm looking I'm looking forward now to what I will do in this coming year amen notice how the Bible talks about how Jesus said you know there's a lot of people that have a lot of enthusiasm they have a lot of rejoicing and then when the word falls on them and so forth the spirit falls on them but if it doesn't go all the way down and it falls into Rocky places it goes for a little while and then what does it say and Withers away a lot of people when they're going it's hard and the persecution happens send people with her away oh my but I'm looking forward to the impairment of the kingdom of God doing more all that I can from the kingdom of God notice how that Jesus says you know if you abide in me and my word abide in you you'll ask what you will and it shall be done he talks about you know that we're devoting Barefoot fruit amen and if you don't bear fruit Jesus said he purges that he he actually trims you off Cuts you off and you're wither but if you do bear some fruit what does he do he prunes you so that you'll have more fruit an experience of fruit isn't that we want I don't know about Jupiter this morning but I want I want more fruit I want more dedication I want a greater Holy Ghost [Music] I want more of Jesus more and more and more I was thinking this morning as I was studying I said you know the Holy Ghost is addictive it ought to be addictive amen I got a level but I gotta have more in that I wasn't back in the bar days whenever you were drinking no simulation you drink until you'd fall over I don't know you didn't have sense enough to quit you felt so good you wanted to drink more until you were throwing up on your partner or whatever it wasn't no fun but let me tell you the Holy Ghost said man we can have so much and Canal you can act like those did on the day of Pentecost and they staggered around and they thought that they were drunk went to God this be a year that morons get drunk on the spirit I mean it's more of them I'm glad and I thought this message when I thought about this message I thought about this I am so glad that even as we have new years we have new moons we have uh new months we have new seasons we have the the beginning of summer we have the beginning of winter we have the beginning of fall we're at the beginning of an ending of spring and all these other Beginnings aren't you glad that God is a god of new beginnings oh we at this new beginning I like I like this thing I'll probably go through this if I have time probably don't have but you know the new birth and so forth when we get together with the Holy Ghost we get the new birth but so much in this world I don't think amen sometimes it takes it out of you doesn't it I mean it drains you up the spirit and we need bad neighbors we need many refillings so many times we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost I need more of that again amen this week it's been kind of a rough week with God of your spirit again they better did stare for you because I'm here to tell you this morning there was people again don't have no New Beginnings do this when he even repented went out and cried amen and tried to repent but there was no repentance there was no new beginning to do this that was horrible imagine having been that Deacon's daughter that brother Madam says God's calling you lady God's calling you amen and she was embarrassed she walked out and said don't you ever call on me like that again my Daddy's got enough religion for all of us you embarrassed me she went out there but if I'm seeing him on the street later that year or a year later she was out on the street somewhere dressed like a prostitute drinking whiskey smoking he addressed her she said here you want some drinks she said no I don't drink don't you should be ought to be ashamed of yourself offering she wasn't ashamed she had no shame she said see that time you were right he was calling me and I turned him down huh he wasn't on me but I turned it down and since then I could see my mother though flying hell laughs no matter how much she would wanted to not be that way she could never come back what a horrible set hey never be do not have a new song Not Another Chance amen or that other lady Catholic woman I believe one time he was witnessing out on the street and the lady come up there and says I wouldn't have my cow follow your religion a couple hours later they called him to the hospital she was calling him tell that man sorry so that man I want to apologize tell that man to come pray for me she was calling for him she said she knew she said the wrong thing and she was being painted and acting before he got there she was dead she says her freckles on her face stood out because of the excruciating pain that she went through screaming for help screaming for mercy and so forth there wasn't no mercy there's Mercy this morning huh praise be to God let me go come on can I oh my so now notice looking forward there is let me just stop there looking forward the Holy Ghost is there when you're looking forward I'm telling you right now I can't imagine being a slave like brother Matt says when you're a slave there's no hope there's no future for you all you got to do is work hard for somebody and all you get is a place to sleep and some food to eat close to where that's it that's all you got but people without hope without a future it looks bleak even if you don't have any natural goals here hello it's kind of bleak huh all you're going to do is be lazy be a couch potato be worthless you need to have goals you need to have ambitions isn't that right but you got to have something to look forward to oh my God and as we Face these New Year we're facing both as I have read Darkness and Light Isaiah 63 says you know there's gross Darkness upon the people but there will be light for you amen now notice David speaking you trust in the Lord put your confidence in him Isaiah said Gross darkness is he coming upon the people but for the church to rise and shine for the glory of thy light has come amen so we faced this year just like we do all years well I thought that's good for us isn't it a regret of our mistakes in the past huh and I wrote down here you know what if you would what kind of person would you do be what kind of what kind of a tormented person would you be if you would just look at your mistakes that you've made the past years huh you could be depressed wouldn't you if you focused on them amen but aren't you so glad that your past can be erased there's an eraser it's not turning a new Leaf it's not turning a new patch but the blood of Jesus Christ your sins dropped in that blood and that bleach it can be gone no more to be remembered cause I'll tell you this right now when you get old your your past if you ain't got it right will haunt you you'll sit in that rocking chair for hours and you'll think about what you did the way that you lived what you've done all your life we that get older know what I'm talking about you think about more when you get older and you realize you have many think about those threats that you have God help us this year not to have as many regrets as what we didn't know yet for years pass amen it'll it's what haunts people it's what people put their guns to their head forward it bothers them people's past bothers them Amen brother Sean probably knows people military you know people that have killed people people that have you know done things they shouldn't perhaps in the military or whatever it was huh because sometimes military people do things unjust huh well I shot that person but I accidentally got that child beside him you didn't celebrate the blood when you know not just military people but anybody that sins against God anybody that does wrong needs that has that regret and then he's purging him and then it's not going to happen but the man says turning a new page like that girl that was in the insane asylum they tried this they tried Anonymous here and there amen she still had the problem no matter what they did he wouldn't fix it and he said turning a new page ain't gonna do it ain't gonna do it amen he's gonna take the blood of Jesus Christ we have regrets that we made and so forth in the past and may looking forward for a future of the Glorious Light of Christ amen but no doubt if we live through this year we'll find many mistakes that we have made amen sure but now let's see this morning God help me not to make so many mistakes somebody's with me help me not do things that are displeasing to the spirit but let me go through this year more pleasing to the Lord more yielded to Christ oh my Hallelujah I don't care if we belong today if we have to move it up to 3 30 is that okay let's just have church is that okay because I'm thinking here of where I'm at and where I want to be in the time in the communion yet and I just got to say stop that Thomas take your time let the Holy Spirit have his way amen we got a lot to make up for Amen Brother Brad can help me maybe with that amen amen all right many mistakes that we'll have made again because that goes along with the pro and con that's the law of average that we live by here on Earth and we're so glad to have a mediator who sits at the right hand of God to make intercessions when we are willing to admit our mistakes that we have done wrong when he forgives them he's full of grace and mercy to forgive us of those mistakes amen I need to laugh for that now this grows Darkness I wish to speak on it for just a minute there is so much of it in the world today and growing darker and darker all the time each year we find that the world has started our spirit systems because they're groping in darkness there's more than amen now those who will not turn to light it's only one thing that I can say to them this coming year that they're going to stoop darker and darker as the year goes on what the about the Bible says you want sin how is that anymore sin will go plump to the core until the skies catch on fire something to that extent it'll get worse and worse I think it was worse and worse until the skies catch on fire I mean as you can see that not politics it's getting worse and worse until the skies are catch on fire because it's going to burn us amen but how many likes in this scripture so many times he says but to you bride I say shalom Shalom to you who believe every word every jot every Tittle to you I say shalom peace I'm just glad for that piece now I notice you're going to stoop darker and darker as this year goes on but to those who turn on this New Year's to the light then you'll get brighter and brighter and brighter until that perfect day that we look for is appearing when all Darkness will fade away oh my that's the reason of that it's why I say to the Church of the Living God today shalom because we are his lights we are the light of the world I'm gonna need this we always say God help me help me to be a better light in my community a brighter light a greater influence on my job as a boss as a worker as a servant let me be a light a greater light in 2023 than I was in 2022. amen help me to be a better brother help me to be a better Pastor help me to be a better husband help me to be a better wife help me to be a better brother to my brother you sisters you better be you want to be a better sister to your sisters let's walk one another more let's draw closer to one another more Let the love of God be felt in this church Among Us greater Fellowship on with another folks I couldn't wait this morning because I'm glad to go to church like this is too long a week and a half is too long I hope everybody felt that way I'll just say as your pastor if you didn't I think you need some prayer you need to pray more amen oh aren't you glad that he has begun he that had begun a good work in you will also perform it amen you know the Bible says in Revelations the third chapter somewhere there it says and I won't go to it I'll just rehearse it save time he says in I believe it's in Revelations 3 when he begins the laodicea churches he says the beginning of the creation of God that he is the beginning he's the beginning of the creation of God Ephesians Paul says that we are his workmen yep create it in Christ Jesus amen now we have a new Time new period coming Amen in Acts acts 1 it says you know it is not for you to know the times of the Season that God has put in his own hand but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be with me of me both in Jerusalem Vegeta Judea and so forth and that's the other most parts of the world Amen so God is beginning a creation he created Christ Jesus it was a new beginning I want to say the next two was ever real had a good time they come out of that rejoicing as you can see on the video and so forth there that end bad you got finally ended even after they went into the promised land because of their sins and idolatry that it did wrong they rejected him now over the last two thousand years because we needed something more than just a carnal Reformation we needed something more than just a oh my God that goes for every young person every person that was so scientist is going to try no you consecrate yourself 100 to the Holy Ghost until God comes in and accepts your sacrifice and fills you with his spirit that's the only way you'll ever overcome that's the only way you'll ever be a Christian is by the power of the Holy Ghost I'm gonna say what comes to my mind the reason some of our young people can't maintain their testimony can't really be a Christian the way because the parents aren't where they ought to be they don't have an atmosphere of prayer they don't have constantly you know the way that they are too I mean believes every one of us is parents you're there to you moms especially you're their tutor like Susanna Wesley the tutor those to treat teach them and so forth so they can just fall right into it amen that just come to mind that just said that that's totally free how many believe that your sisters that is your calling in life that is your duty to God is to raise those children for the Lord bam says what 20 25 however long it is that you have to raise them and that's your job you've done your job huh that's your duty amen praise the Lord is this all right amen then we think about things that people do for New Beginnings people do the craziest stuff just to have a new starter everybody wants a new start I got to think about unbelievers they're not happy with the earring back in my day when I was 20 years old that was about 40 years ago something like that you know some of the guy his brother Sean did have a little little ring leaning ring left here and I still don't know exactly what it meant don't really care to I don't guess but it was supposed to be okay huh and then you ended up with Dennis Rodman right now I've watched some of these people I don't know if you've I think I may have shown some of the pictures here before of a person that had their ears way big and and completely faced that too horrible right and and what I read about him is he gets some more attention a lot of these people do that for attention just to get more attention they're so lonely I guess they're so insecure they want somebody to say oh wow look at that tattoo you got you look at that tattoo and I says wow well that's gonna hold nobody said nothing in the world to me I'll put another one over here they went from the earrings to what the nose ringing now you can't go through Dairy Queen with somebody let me tell you something it's unsafe but anyway to that to tattoos and all these other things dig out the great extremes just to try to have a new start girls to cut their hair a little bit I want to look a little different so that the devil's Temptations for a girl cut your hair huh not about to deal with them to wear a little makeup a little this that or the other amen be glad of how God made you amen you say well I got crooked teeth I don't know my wife's got one crooked teeth one crooked teeth over here nothing I like that crooked teeth it's just unique to me I like I dislike it it doesn't bother me a bit I'm telling you something if you got a girlfriend that's got all kinds of crooked teeth if you really love her now please don't look perfect to you you might have a boyfriend that smells like a pogat but it smells good to you come on folks is that right it's about the brother said I like the smell of that pole cat that's my poke okay God help me oh my I didn't mean to go there but that was a prophet let me tell you how young men need to look for girls that have character I thank God for having young ladies in this church that have character amen any any good man should uh you know see the girls that we have in our church that's Christian cares faithful folks I'm here to tell you that that beats any beauty any you know beauty queen any day it got to be a beauty King to have character and to be likable amen folks I'm here to tell you most of the times it goes the other way with beauty yeah anyway I didn't mean to go that way but that's all right I guess the Holy Spirit wanted to encourage some of us amen praise the Lord God is good isn't he so we got here look at this look at what I wrote down here people are forever moving people move here people move there and I rode down here I told my wife I said honey I'm preaching on moving this morning I'm preaching on on this and I'm a preach on 24 inches 44 inches people moved from church to church they go from place to place never satisfied always looking for the perfect Church huh didn't even brother Brown say that when he was here people changing memberships doing this doing that we as human beings for some reason things get old to us and we want something new huh I don't have a problem driving an S15 for about 10 15 years as long as it gets me from point A to point B yeah but some people I gotta have a new vehicle now I've had this two whole years I better get off of this there's gonna be somebody sitting in here does that and they're gonna feel real bad I hope not all I can say is this there ain't a thing wrong with it as long as you got plenty money all right ain't nothing wrong with it but we're just nature that way but now if you ain't got the money you're going deeper into that and stuff then again you got a problem you man I've been thinking about trading money and it's got that you know I just got it paid for the other day and if I'm ever going to have a better truck mother's brother Jeff I better do it now because I have more put down on that other women ever I just I not have payments too much to do it so I don't know if I'll do it or not amen but we like how many we're like that we like different things people want a new preacher let's vote him out get a new one I'm tired of that church I'm going somewhere else I don't get fed anymore I've heard that a lot coming from other places better watch what I say because I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings but find out that they got the same problems when they get here or go there that they had before amen what if I come up here and says look oh my God church anymore because I don't feel like I'm getting fed you'd say that that brother it's got to be your own fault you're the preacher you're the one that feeds us so if I got that problem guess what it's my own fault I need to get in there I need to learn we got 11 on a date you got the Bible if you are hungry it's your own fault you could go wrong with because you are spiritually deprived you need to get on your knee and ask God to help you you ought to come over here in church we're on fire you could need to come fed up but the man says what people some people go from can't make it from revival to Revival Amanda he's needing more needing to be fed and then people who are always fed up he said fed up I like that Fed Up word and that's in the proper way in other words you're full

times New Beginnings a day right Peter says how am I often am I supposed to forgive my brother seven times no seven times seven seven times 490 right in a day he said 490 times a day you forgive him so if somebody really genuinely repents 490 times a day you could have it that many times that's how gracious God is to give you a new beginning aren't you glad for that I thank God for his Mercy because I look at Judas I look at that uh well a Deacon's daughter I look at that other woman different ones that they didn't get another chance when God's a few black pass him against the Holy Ghost and God Cuts you off folks that is a horrible place to be we're thankful that God doesn't do that to his children amen God bless you turn your bibles if you will we'll just get right into the community it's a good time to just remember the Lord on New Year's Day don't you I'm so glad that this New Year's Day ended up on Sunday I think it's a real good way to start amen this year as the prophet of God said his fellowship and and communion and so forth amen so let's turn our Bibles First Corinthians I believe it is amen how many is looking forward to Fellowship today and another service this evening amen just a good day in the Lord First Corinthians 11. verse 26. Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same animal so he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this two years often as he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink of this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come amen how many believes it's important it's important wherefore whosoever shall lead of this bread and drinketh this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup examine yourself make sure your sins are under the blood foreignation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the law that we should not be condemned with the world wherever my brethren when he come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest well I said in order when I come amen today I'm going to trust that you have already made things right with the Lord and all those that want to take communion if you would come over around to the right side the rest can be remain seated if anybody doesn't want to even if y'all come around
