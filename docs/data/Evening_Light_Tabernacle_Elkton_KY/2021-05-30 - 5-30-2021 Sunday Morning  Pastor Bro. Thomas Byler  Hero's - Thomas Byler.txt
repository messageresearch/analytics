to see you this morning amen amen it's good to see everybody praise the lord irvin and martha good to see y'all amen glad you all pulled through that amen you mean you want to give a word to the lord

through that when you do get your strength back you really appreciate it amen and so praise be to god we're very glad amen so we'll probably go next month we'll wait i would usually have communion

school classes and our children's classes again lord willing uh the first of july maybe we'll kind of set that goal for now okay amen praise the lord i'll tell you what i feel like jumping up and down i'm going into these stores and look around and nobody's wearing masks and i'm like i even got i even i even said it in front of me well i said something about i said this is awesome not wearing no mask you know they didn't pay me much attention i was just very glad to see it amen you put yours back on if you like but i like having mine off if i can help it amen so praise god amen and so amen so anyway so some quite something i believe a prophet taught something about biological warfare you know right and i think from the sounds of it that's what that was all about certainly not something i don't think that god made amen but something that man made and uh so anyway that's the world we're living in isn't it amen so god bless you this morning it's just good to be in the house of the lord and it's good to see you amen and good to see everybody let's bow our heads kind of heavenly father we come before you once again lord jesus coming into your house lord jesus to present ourselves to you lord to see where we're at with you father to look in the mirror of your word and father's asking you god to speak to our hearts speak to our lives and help us to change lord into the image that you have wanted us to be from the beginning we ask god that you'll bless those that are not here traveling in different places be with them in special way and lord in the virtual audience be with them also god we ask you blessing upon them in a special way and we do thank you lord jesus from your many blessings that you've bestowed upon us father lord for the good report that we got from timmy lord jesus and him father not having cancer and so forth and everything heaven went well we just thank you for that lord jesus and for your many blessings and we just ask god that you'd be with all the different ones that just have a need for a touch from you lord sister janet we ask god that you just continue to touch her body lord jesus and give her strength and healing father that she may enjoy life lord jesus and to be in perfect health lord for we know and believe with all of our heart that by your stripes we are healed lord we ask god you're blessing upon the reading of the word the meditation of our heart we ask god that you'll bless come now and anoint your word in a special way to our hearts make it real to us father for we ask these blessings in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen i want to do something and i i just feel uh that we owe certainly oh to it this is a memorial day and i did a little a little bit of search on it and i think they started this memorial day thing back in the around 1868 or something like that amen after the civil war they began to get together and kind of celebrate or not celebrate but to commemorate uh and to decorate the graves of those who had they had lost and so forth and so they ended up making a time of remembering those who have fallen in battle and so forth as you think of where it originates from and so i was thinking you know because i seen on the news somewhere where some young i guess college kids wanted to try to put a petition together to cancel memorial day you know you know i just thought in my mind of how i would like to have a little discussion with them you know and telling them of how many gave their lives and how they gave their lives so they could sit where they're sitting so they can live where they're living so they can actually put up a petition if they wanted to like that and act like that they died so they could do that and you don't even appreciate that you know and if you don't appreciate you know the country and the people that's given their life you don't deserve it you know right it ain't right amen but anyway that was just kind of going around in my mind but i appreciate god what god has given us i appreciate amen those who have given their lives and there's been millions isn't that right amen you could you could be in some hitler under some hitler regime is that right go into the gas chambers if you don't do just what they said or starving in their camps or working to death that's what it could have been isn't that right but we thank uh god for our heroes and for those who have given their lives and we want to take a moment of silence just to remember amen all of those who are laying in the graves today young and old and and all those who have died so that we can have the freedom of being here this morning and worship the lord according to the dictates of our heart so let's have a moment of silence um amen amen amen if you will turn your bibles this morning and this will be my memorial day i thought about memorial day and remembering those who have died for us and so forth so i begin to thinking about how that really you know in battles different things that happen a lot of times people will get different kind of stars and badges for heroism in that right but you know i think it doesn't matter who it is anybody that has given their life for their country and so forth amen is worthy of the status of hero ship don't you think amen and so this morning i want to speak with speak about footprints amen following footprints and i'll talk about super superheroes amen amen following footprints superheroes amen turn if you will with me and we'll go to the book of hebrews amen and i want to start with chapter 12 verse 1 and i think this is what we spoke on wednesday evening and we want to take that up again and go in a different direction if we could this morning with the help of the lord therefore seeing that we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god another scripture in romans 8 if you want to turn with me we'll read these two scriptures before we go into our main thought that we want to pick up here in a little bit and that'll be chapter 11. we want to go through chapter 11 of hebrews and talking about amen the great warriors of faith in the bible amen romans 8 very familiar scripture but it'll go along with what we're talking about eight and verse twenty nine romans eight and verse twenty nine for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen first i want to start out by reading a psalm amen the song psalm amen called the psalm of life and it's talking about footprints on the same time would that be okay and it goes like this it says what the heart of the young man said to the psalmist tell me not in mournful numbers life is but an empty dream for the soul is dead that slumbers and things are not what they seem life is real life is earnest and the grave is not its goal amen i pause so you can say amen right there isn't that the truth that's right that the grave is not its goal how many is glad for that praise be to god i'm sure glad that it's we're not just a bunch of monkeys come here live for a little while and then it's all over with wouldn't we would be without hope wouldn't that be a hopeless situation and yet anybody that doesn't believe in jesus christ is just in that situation amen oh my now notice when that's spoken of the soul not enjoyment and not sorrow is our destined end or away but to act that each tomorrow may find us further than today amen amen but to act that each tomorrow find us further than today art is long and time is fleeting and our hearts those stout and brave still like muffled drums are beating funeral marches to the grave in the world's broad field of battle in the baby of life to be like dumb uh be not dumb driven cattle be a hero in the strife amen trust no future high ever pleasant let the dead pass bury its dead act act in the living present heart within and god overhead amen how many believes that don't worry about the past don't look back but act in the present live in the present amen my lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing over or life solemn mane a furlong and shipwrecked mother seeing shall take heart again let us then be up and doing with a heart of any faith for any fate amen so in other words let's get up let's go doing it doesn't matter what our fate we don't know what the future holds do we no but no matter what it is let's be up and let's be doing still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait amen so i believe that how many believes that as we go through this life we leave behind us footprints on the sands of time in other words we leave footprints for somebody to follow amen for somebody to come after but the band tells the story of a man one time in the neighborhood a good man and his son and how did he went in the city and went from block to block from house to house and all of his friends different ones maybe around christmas time i believe it was and how did he went and he would go visit the different ones and and they'd say here have a little wine or have a little drink you know or whatever it was and he'd take a little drink he'd go to another one and they'd give him a little drink another one give him a little drink and social drink so to speak you know and amen he was going through the park i believe it was and he was going down through there and he looked back and his son was just doing all kinds of zig zag walking he looked back and says son what's wrong with you why are you walking like that huh he says dad i'm following your footprints and he was said that i'm so sorry son uh you know he realized that he was setting the example amen amen now let me say this i truly believe that god has made each and every individual he has made this and created us in a certain way amen and that is that we look to people how many notes we always look to somebody we always want to be like somebody and god made us that way you know right he made us to look to somebody we look to heroes we look we look to people like george washington abraham lincoln we look at the great founders of this country that's almost illegal to say nowadays isn't that right amen oh boy don't let me get political here but from what i understand so some black folks that was tearing down abraham lincoln's statue what do you all think of that the very man that was a martyr died to free them huh that's not very good at all is it no sir and different statues all the different statues of people great men amen of america and i believe that america had some great men amen like abraham lincoln when he seen slavery down in the south he says i'm gonna hit that thing if it costs me my life amen and we know that they weren't too happy with what he accomplished in freeing the slaves amen and they shot him in the back of the head amen i like another story brother brown talked about how that in the museum one time by the bedroom visit the museum amen and he's seen a black man i believe it was he was their sister crying and crying and crying and he was looking at abraham lincoln's stature and the dress there i believe it was his wife's dress if i wasn't wrong and amen and he was looking at it and he asked him well what are you crying about what is so meaningful he says you know i'm just sitting here amen and i realized it was his blood that freed me it meant so much to him it was his blood cost him his life but how many knows we've had a great hero amen the lord jesus christ amen that set us free to shed his blood so that it don't matter what color you are we can all be free we're free amen oh i like brothers and sisters i don't believe that there's any racism in christianity ain't no christian no it doesn't matter when you get over there there'll be a it talks about how that they'll be of every tribe kindred and tongue will be there amen if we can't get along here we probably won't be there that's right because we're going to get along just fine over there we should get a long fine over here ain't a human being you try to take a chimpanzee and give yourself a blood transfusion you're going to have problems but it don't matter if you're chinese i don't care what you are hello we can all give each other blood transfusions i mean we're all one blood so to speak amen but this morning i want to talk about that we want to look at because how many knows that we are actually made the kind of people that we are all right most likely and it has a great bearing you know on how that we are raised isn't that right amen the books that we read the things that we look at the things that we meditate on to things that our parents teach us has a bearing on how we turn out amen the kind of character that we are because we know that abraham lincoln the prophet said that abraham lincoln amen up to a certain time the only books that he had was the bible and the foxes book of martyrs and no doubt i don't know about you but looking at those people and those you look in martyr's mirror book and you'll see them amen where they putting them drowned them amen they're drawn to them they're bringing them back them up but they have big bellies where they're watching their belly is full of water and they're trying to get them to renounce christ it's some terrible pictures i still got it planted in my mind from where i looked at it when i was young and i had an impression upon me i learned at an early age there is some serious evil in the world amen but i'm glad brother kim black glenn did i found out lady today so also some serious good in the world that sets you free that makes you happy that no matter how evil the evil is the good is so much greater y'all are sounding real good this morning i hear a lot of amens here i'm getting a good rebound i like that amen sometimes it gets awful quiet out there amen i heard brother man say yesterday there's a man coming into his service and a woman i guess in the back hey man and scream you know what he says brother baby it makes me chill run up my back when they do that he says brother i'll tell you what if they don't it makes me have chills up my back scary folks when you ain't got no rebound you know everybody quite it's so scary to me what is wrong what's going on here what's got everybody so depressed what's got everybody so down oh you know we need to watch see what's going on here amen it's scary but when you're free when you got a smile on your face when you got a amen when you got a hallelujah oh my let me tell you something if you are i'm gonna i was gonna save this for the last but if you are a christian that is on fire and that loves the lord in this wicked hour you are a hero you have overcome all kinds of devils you have all kind all kinds of evil depressing spirits that you have overcome all kinds of giants that you've slain to get to that place amen and i'll tell you what the biggest meanest ugliest looking teeth sticking everywhere wicked looking mean enemy the meanest one you got is the one when you look in the mirror it's yourself i mean those it's our self that gets in the way our own self we could just let go and let god have his way amen there's no telling what god will do but this guy gets in the way oh my the old carnal mind he tries to tell you this and they tried to tell you that but you got to throw them things out and accept what god has said praise be to god oh yeah we know the prophet taught us and we know about history that america typed israel driving out the occupants of that land a good land that flowed with milk and honey is that right and we drove the indians back just like israel drove them back they had joshuas they had calebs they had all these great warriors we had great warriors we had people like george washington hello according to the problem that he swept before he crossed that delaware before he crossed that thing he got down on his knees until his clothes were completely wet from having an all night prayer meeting how many know i mean he's got a picture of george washington crossing that delaware on that ice he broke up water with that american flag sailing isn't that a heroic it's a real heroic picture of a man and let me just make this statement and put this down in your hard drive this morning and that day is that real men are made on their knees real women are made real ladies on their knees that's where they're made that's why they're molded because i'll tell you right now unless you have a close relationship with your creator you're not going to amount to much anybody that ever amounted to a hillary is a man and they believe god [Applause] because that's where he draws his strength from that's where faith comes by faith we understand that the worlds were created by faith abel offered a promo section that sacrificed the democrat by faith abraham by faith moses conquered all of egypt why because that's where your source of strength comes that's where you become a man you get away from that you'll become all sissified you let all the little kinds of little imps and demons get on you of differences bickering fusses hello all kinds of things will get on you if you don't stay on your knees folks i want to tell you something don't show me your biceps show me your bags on your knees amen show me the socks and the bags on your knees and i'll tell you how big a man you are a man that's been praying the man that's dedicated to his creator oh my god you see folks that's why i read that in romans we were predestinated to be in the image of his son there's a lot of people that i want to be like i want to be the prayer warrior of george washington hello and i want to be as strong and as straight-standing and as fearless as stonewall jackson huh stonewall jackson isn't that nice george washington they mean something abraham lincoln i mean he's a prayer warrior he believes in god you know how many times he tried to be president he was a you know he didn't have much schooling or anything but yet he became

him didn't he and if i'm not wrong it was thomas called didymus that said whenever one of the disciples was dying he says let's go down there and die with him thomas ended up having a whole lot of love with us already man praise be to god so we look at it we look at people who we would like to be like and it's what you become young people teenagers who do you want to be like what do you want to

have amen what abraham lincoln had the love for all of humanity amen i don't personally i don't see how in the world we ever had slavery in the first place i'm not preaching politics i'm just preaching the gospel here am i right oh man we're created equal under god and all that stuff is what i'm talking about you know i guess somebody thought people weren't man come on people right sure we needed a war sure we needed a straightening out now right any kind of wrong that's in the world needs a straightening out amen but think about it the great heroes the heroes of america amen oh my and to think that she was founded upon what was america founded upon the very thing that they're now turning away and let me tell you something a nation that is based upon christianity and the serving of almighty god and god helped us god picked this up isn't that right god was with us in world war one he was with us as world war ii he helped us defeat germany did japan he helped us defeat all them but when we turned away from him in 1956 god turned his back on us we ain't hardly one of war sins folks all we do is smear things around and make things worse huh we were founded as the prophet said upon christian principle and upon god huh i still want to get up in congress brother glenn and i want to just get up there and hold my dollar up hey here's your all of y'all that got money how many got money everybody got money everybody all the old religious people aren't you everybody religious that got a dollar bill in their pocket because it says in god we trust that's right out there in god we trust don't you know that there's a lot of people that just hates that a lot of people out there that just hates that i wonder how long much longer it'll be on there amen oh my because this nation did we trusted in god but let me tell you something there's something that's not so good for a nation that turns your back on their god read joshua the 24th chapter he talks about he says you know joshua told israel he says you cannot serve god because he's a jealous god and when he has done you good if you go to whoring after other gods he will punish you for it amen so y'all ain't able to he says yeah we are we commit ourselves to commit we commit ourselves to following him just after joshua had said you know as for me and my house we're going to serve the lord they all want to serve the lord in that and they did they made that decision and joshua said i witnessed before you this day of the decision that you have made let me tell you when you claim the name of christianity it's time to use less sell out lock stock and barrel because god doesn't want you this halfway stuff he doesn't accept it and i want to preach a message on these one of these days how that god is not pleased with our halfway walk with him you expect him to come and change your mortal body one of these mornings or at any time to come and change your mortal body and you don't love him with all your heart all your mind all your soul all your saints huh no it's not going to happen you're going to be disappointed god is getting a church ready he's getting a church ready for our champ by body change folks i'm here to tell you you can oh buddy i'm a pastor i watch people and i can tell you outside of the holy ghost you'll never change you'll always be the same amen year after year after year you'll always be the same no matter how much i preach how much i say it will never change you it takes the holy ghost to change you it takes the baptism of the holy ghost and it takes you getting in the right place towards the holy ghost to come down and change you none of us are changeable outside of the holy ghost you can wash a pig up all he wants to it heads right straight back to the mud puddle it's it's nature you can't change your nature outside of the holy ghost how many please we need more of the holy ghost we need more freedom less bondage oh my i'll tell you what when you get free in the holy ghost you just let go let go and let god have his way amen that man came to brother and says all that screaming in church oh it just makes me shiver he says well you're certainly going to be uncomfortable over there because people are going to be screaming and shouting they're going to be praising god and hallelujah all right you'll be real uncomfortable when you get to heaven personally brother glenn i can't wait to see it i just i'm looking forward to it aren't you i'm looking forward to it because i'm a noisy person sorry [Music] i think when it comes to some of that i'm a little like david a little bit extreme i ain't ripped my shirt off yet i got your attention now oh my god we thought he'd be having a vote after all that wouldn't we oh but he did he was what's man he just went nuts he went crazy almost just i didn't know i ain't seen the spirit the dancing dance oh my and that lukewarm michelle i guess her name was mitchell or michelle something like that i can't pronounce it right well look at him he's like one of the vain fellows that gets drunk and acts all up huh he said you thought that was bad we're gonna go out there and do it again tomorrow and i'm telling you now amen ain't got good to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are but we ought to praise him a little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow we ought to be closer to god today than what we was yesterday or a week ago or a month ago we had to get closer to god because i'm going to meet him one of these days are you getting closer to god oh my sometimes work how many of those work is really just depresses it pulls you down huh i thought this week man if i have a job that keeps me out of church a job that gets me away from god i need to quit my job you got a business that keeps you away from church keeps you out of church away from god sell your business i'm thinking 59 the god's chosen place of worshipper god's provided where oh my and i got to get everybody that date i i've listened to that tape about five times this week brother bam says it doesn't matter what it is love the lord with all your heart soul mind and strength don't let anything else come in the way that's how god wants it praise be to god oh my but it is now i want to tell you something right now let me just say this everything in our life everything in this generation everything around us is geared to rob your spiritual walk with god and if he can take one thing away from you he's got you you know what that one thing is how many wants me to tell you what that one thing is how many wants me to tell you what the one thing is one two three four this is a participation service here today all right he wants to rob you of your time that's right well i ain't got time to pray i ain't got time to read my bible the two most essential things in your life and you ain't got time for it he got you he robbed you of your time now you can't pray now you come to church with a move and you come to church and you stink like a skunk folks people come in sometimes with an attitude as bad as a skunk it stinks how do we get anything from god well we don't have come in here cleaned out washed on our knees saying god god wash me wash me clean lord jesus on our knees time on our knees amen that's what we need that's what i need that's what we all need how many knows we need more of the spirit yeah we got the fullness of the word but what good does that do if i just come up here and say well now i guess you know the flowers are growing pretty nice today and the word says this and the word says that and now that wonderful services what we have a service that no it takes spirit take spirit how many wants more spirit more of the spirit to quicken the word because i want to tell you something that's what makes heroes all those people that get medals of honor of bravery and everything else amen and their cousin their brother their comrade the people they were close to was out there amen and they had been shot in the leg baby both legs they were trying to crawl they didn't think about it says my body i'm going to get my body if it gets my head blown off and they run out there and they drag their body the same thing why because of something in here they don't sit around saying well you know maybe i wonder if i should do this let's wait till the bullets slow down they don't think about it they go out there and then they get rewarded with great heroic act that's a hero for bravery they call it bravery i call it spirit i call it love and that's what we need every one of us amen lord help us listen prophet god says it this way he says we have in this country we have so many dissatisfied people he was talking about identification and identifying yourself with somebody people are not satisfied huh rob rod rodman is his name rod rodman you all know him the basketball player that tattooed himself up dennis rodman yeah the guy that the north korean got leader like so well he was one of the first i guess you know and tattooing himself all up and look at how that the people idolize that look at that look at this how the people aren't happy with one little tattoo they weren't happy they hear like i said a while ago uh they weren't happy with that they they're never satisfied people are not satisfied people sitting in pews they're not satisfied why because they look to the wrong thing for satisfaction they try to find satisfaction in drugs and alcohol they find it in people in hollywood movie stars huh and basketball players race car drivers and everything else they look for satisfaction and don't realize there's only one place that you can sit under ever a green tree and be totally happy all by yourself most of the time when we're not satisfied we complain about somebody don't love me somebody don't love me i don't care if nobody loves me as long as he loves me now if he don't love me and i don't feel like he loves me neither am i going to feel like anybody else loves me because i'll be empty inside and my wife will have to have me a pity party oh honey now come on okay let me tell you something about my wife i like my wife i have a pity party for myself sometimes and she helps me snap right out of it [Laughter] oh yeah that's right honey it don't look good on you it don't fit you it ain't you i'll pick myself up by the boot shop from head on brother oh my praise the lord but i'm just glad that we can look to all of these great warriors that we want to mention more of and we want to be like that but they all have footprints that have a fault in them isn't that right every man has a fault in it you know david was a man after god's own heart and i want to be like him when it comes to slaying giants in my life don't you want to be able to slay giants in your life and so forth but he had a flaw and women was his flaw amen it was his weakness amen and so he had a great flaw and so we don't want to follow that even the prophet of god brother branham how many know amen he had to god was with him he had an angel with him never could have a service amen but god would come down and vindicate and prove that god is here he's alive he's real jesus is really resurrected but yet he had flaws tell white lies i couldn't say maybe lies but he did that one time and he had to make that right and he confessed to that and he says look don't let my faults be a stumbling block his fault let me tell you something his fault was a stumbling block to me okay are you following me but his confession was a stepping stone for me sure the fault is nothing good but the confession shows that i can follow this man amen that's why i always think one of the greatest things that a human being can do are you listening one of the greatest miracles the greatest thing that a human being can do is say i'm sorry i was wrong that comes hard first admit i'm wrong i'm sorry people just don't have the ability hardly to humble themselves because we're so determined that we're right the older i get the more i realize that we should realize that we very easily can be wrong amen you have to be careful praise be to god we look at those three abraham lincoln george washington abraham lincoln's example that i like was the fact of what he fed on how he was raised and i believe it was him that said you know if there's any good in me credit my mom she taught me right is that right how many knows we need good mothers we need to be taught right we need to bring them up in the nurturing admonition of god and teach them the things that they need to know that's what molds of that's what shapes him amen and the things that he reads and so forth and he became a great man on account of that and that's what our young people should take an example of george washington's prayer life and his bravery after he prayed that night and after he crossed the delaware it said that there were three musket bullet holes in his coat and none of them touched him amen none of them touched him but yet that had to be awful close didn't see what prayer does he was there praying all night and praying and praying and praying next day god was with him when the enemy was aiming their rifle right at his chest hello the angels were over there on each one of that enemies that was aiming at him and they made them guys twitch just that maybe right just made him miss what i'm okay i'm stupid baby but i believe it i believe i love believing it something had to happen i believe the angel is watching over him how many believes the angels watch over you yes sir it watches over us when we have a walk with the lord amen we know that the angel of the lord was with the prophet all the days of his life i mean believes that no matter if it's a hotel room or wherever he was the angel was always there and so and i thought you know he had that what about us but what he said was those that fear him the bible says that the people that fear god the angels of the lord don't come visit you once in a while it says stay in camp come on glory that makes me feel good that the angels of god are camping around you if you fear god that's why it was so close but it didn't get you so close almost but it didn't get you because i'll tell you what when your time's up the angel back up time to go home but until then nothing can happen to you that's right nothing can happen until he pulls it back and pulls your card but the angels of god are around about those that fear him amen i'll just comes to mind just stoma jackson another great man amen i'm gonna come up to snowball jackson and say stonewall jackson what in the world what in the world makes you to be able to stand there and i think he fought indians and and i don't know just if he was in the civil war maybe also but arrows perhaps flying behind me he says how can you just stand there and all these things but it's flying everywhere things going everywhere how can you do it and i can just hear someone back it's a reply this is the way the prophet got his own wall jackson took his foot and kicked some dirt i'll tell you what i never take a drink of water without thanking my lord first that's how we ought to do don't eat that hot dog without thanking the lord don't take that drink of water without thanking the lord don't eat that biscuit you gave me without thanking the lord don't get up until you thank the lord for being able to have a good night's rest everything you do just thank god have a relationship with god and he will protect you he will watch out for you praise be to god this morning and now his name these names are forever edged in history amen even as the prophet said great men that founded this country just like the great men did with joshua and caleb amen are you all ready to start all right let's start hebrews 11th chapter now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders became heroes obtained a good report how many when you are laying at your deathbed would like to be able to hear people say that man was a good man that woman was a good woman they have a good report about you how many wants to be that way you want a good report when children bring their report card home isn't that right they'd like to see if there's f sauna d's b's c's a's a plus is that right how many wants a plus on your scorecard amen then don't look to the past let the bed bury the dead in the past live in the present amen like the psalm says live in the present it's about now it's not about what yesterday it's about today how many believes that this morning how many will take it from this very second on it's from the second on what i do it's how i live from this second home all right through faith we understand that the worlds are framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were made not made of things which do appear amen let me just stop here if you are a christian and you have the holy spirit which is god in your heart amen then it's not hard for you to believe things that are not yet but you know they will be amen number one by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts gifts and by be it being dead yet speaketh i want to take the first phrase of that we realize that by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice to me abel is the first hero he's also the first martyr that gave his life for what he believed let me tell you this this morning that there's two types of worship there is worship that is vain and let me tell you the majority of the world's worship to god this morning is in vain a ritualistic it's become so common to people that it's just a tradition to go to church and worship huh it's vain god don't accept that stinking sacrifice he wants a fresh lamb he wants the best lamb he wants one without spot he wants to have you to worship from your heart when we sing amazing great how sweet this out it's not the same old dragony song no it's just as fresh next week as it was this morning amazing grace how sweet to sound acceptable worship cain had unacceptable worship god didn't accept his worship he put all kinds of effort into it but god didn't accept it because it wasn't revealed to him it wasn't real to him wasn't the revelation to him how many once i say god help me to have worship that is accepted to god every time we come into the house of god huh we should have worship that is accepted by god not me him huh otherwise it's in vain i'm just going to take a few here is that okay and verse 5 by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death now how many believers according to second thessalonians we which are alive and remain unto the coming lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye over there in ii corinthians i believe there is a body changing coming oh i like to think about how that before god even called no one before the flood came there was this man this hero bible hero called enoch remember this is the hero chapter right here people who left us footprints on the sands of time that 6 000 years later it is still going through the microphones of churches it's still ringing out there the testimony of what they did amen he was translated that he should not see death and was not found amen how many is looking forward to playing hide and seek that's right i'm gonna hide they're gonna seek and they're not gonna find me that's right that's what we're looking for he couldn't be found he was gone because god had translated oh my praise the lord now we come to the part where it tells the condition that you got to be in if you expect to go are you with me for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased the pastor that he pleased the church please his wife family who did he please he pleased god how many believes that that has to be every individual's responsibility this morning is that you please god you want to go into rapture might be translated don't expect not to be pleasing god but please god amen that's what i want to do that's that's oh another place i believe it says that he walked with god and he was not he walked with god can i change something this morning i don't like many preachers changing stuff on me here because i believe in saying with the word but i think it'll fit the word okay we don't walk with god god walks in us remember jesus says the holy spirit he says i'm with you but he shall be in you amen not that don't that don't mean that god wasn't right there but we know that the holy spirit couldn't come in the way that it did until after pentecost now god walks in us he is with you but shall be in you so we walk in god with god everywhere we go amen you love him but without faith it is impossible to amount to a hill of beans didn't brother bound say if you don't believe in god any man that ever mounted to anything believed in god or should he say a hill of beans or something like that that's right in other words if you amount to anything and look at the debauchery people don't know if they're male or if they're female why because they got away from faith in god they're all confused that's right i wouldn't care what it cost me that ain't nothing but the truth people are completely confused you know the sad part is the adults know better but when they start they're telling their kids well maybe you're not a boy you're not a girl they're truly going to believe their parents well well i don't know no no i am they're going to cause confusion to their kids not pity those children and hell will be hot for those that directed it in that way god's got a special place for you in the furnace that's right except thou repent and i only say accept thou repent because i believe there's still grace still on the throne one that he won't be and then that part will be taken out amen without faith in god without faith it's impossible to please him for he that comes to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him praise the lord by faith noah let's look at another hero by faith noah being warned of god of things not yet as not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he obtained i condemned the world and became the heir of righteousness which is by faith they made a copy of noah's ark is it northern kentucky brother troy is it really big tell us really really big how many football fields two or three football fields long that right and on top of a hill and they had to have four-wheel drive they had to have well i don't know what they had but anyway pull the stuff up there way up on top of the hill isn't that right can you imagine what the people must have thought you'd have thought that he built it by the river or by the ocean but he built it and built it and built it and built it 30 years 40 years 50 years 60 years 70 years 80 years 90 years you're my hero noah you held out folks i want to tell you something right now i really admire people who hold out i can follow footprints that keep walking in the sand that keep pressing on in christ my soul has no pleasure in those that draw back amen noah he had faith he had a revelation that god was going to do what that it was going to rain that he was going to flood the flood the whole earth god said i'm going to destroy the man with some flood there's a big flood coming our prophet prophesied that america he seen nothing but burnt over smoldering ashes slumps and everything blowed all two pieces that's what he saw i mean knows that's what i see that's what i believe that's what you believe when you have faith in god's word you see what's coming and what do you do you come to church on sunday morning you come to church on wednesday you pray during the week you stay close to god you prepare for what's coming every true christian looks ahead faith is a long-range vision it don't just look at how much money you got in the bank it looks much further than that it looks about where your soul's gonna be when all of that money ain't gonna help you one bit where is your soul gonna be taking your last breath we're not gonna ask you how much money you made we're gonna ask you what you did for god how did you serve god with the breath that you had how close was you did you please god amen let me tell you something if everybody will do that one thing and that includes myself i'll not have to preach on hardly anything just please god everything will be fine how many of those is when you get away from that when you do things that's not pleasing to god then i got to come up there you say you love god and you do this and you do that come on people that's what the rebuke of god was in this whole generation amen somebody must have been praying for service this morning i know i was say lord help me amen [Applause] because sometimes sometimes it's tough it gets tough to preach up here once in a while most of the time it's easy and i thank you people for that i think i've got a great group of people we've got a great group of people here amen i believe god's in it don't you it's important that you believe that because otherwise we're just another church just another church when i look at our history when i look at what god the rivers that god has brought us the walls that he's for taking us over i couldn't even begin to stop i can't begin to tell you brother brian he's been there a long i thought about him this morning he don't like to be talked about but i'm gonna talk about him a little bit this morning when i think about a rock brother brian he's been a rock he's went through storms and floods and everything else sisters look at where they are right there huh hold steady folks hold steady we'll get there don't let the devil pull you to the side and and whisper a bunch of lies to you in all of our faults the thing of it is we have faults we're not perfect neither was israel that's exactly why they wanted that prophet to curse them look at all their faults look at their backside look at all their faults you get to look at that and you think there ain't no god there god ain't there and everything else the devil can detract you by that but what is it what are we trying to do what is our achievement what is our goal it's just simply letting god live in our lives having his way folk god wasn't even intending to say that but it just came out is that okay i believe you got to have confidence in your church you're going to have confidence you're in your your imperfect pastor oh even better bam says if you ever expect to get it get anything from your pastor and so forth even the folks that you know you still got to believe that he's a man of god or you ain't getting nothing you still got to believe above all the faults and everything else he's a man of god i wasn't expecting to say that but i did that's what the prophet said folks i tell you right now when i see here things that the prophet said sometime i'm going to do it i'm going to take a bunch of quotes and bring them up here just the things that the prophet said that we really need to still come up to there's a lot there not just legalism about your dress this that or the other but it's about how we serve the lord our prayer life a whole lot amen all right it's only 20 after 12 i got at least 10 more 10 more minutes is that okay all right noah praise be to god immortal in heaven today how many bees he's over there no he's over all these people are over there amen waiting on us waiting on us amen and he prepared for something that wasn't there yet amen and that's what you and i are doing we don't see it yet there's several things we're looking for a translation of the body how many believes that we're looking for a translation of this body and because i'll tell you what i don't want to ever see brother peter i don't never want to see a bunch of ashes and burnt over america well most likely if you're here for that you'll be burnt up anyway you won't get to see much of it i'm gonna i'm gonna describe this the way that i've had several dreams already i've had i i dream a lot and i've had my wife practically get on the side of the bed and get on her prayer bones and pray because i was praying for my mother to get the holy ghost in my dreams so heavy jesus even the atmosphere was heavy with the holy spirit and she just what am i supposed to do here and i have many dreams of going in the actual translation and going up into heaven and and saying this is what the prophet said that in a good great church service where the holy spirit is it's just that but multiplied a million times and i was going up and going up saying oh praise be to god i was just going interrupt it was a wonderful thing amen but i have to be honest with you i've had other dreams to where i watched a nuclear blast and then this nuclear blast that dust that turns up and it was coming my way huh nuclear explosion it's coming my way wiping everything out coming and i knew this is the end that's the way it is for people who are left here hello one person is going to pull that trigger according to the prophet god and there's going to be a missile come up there piccadilla on the radar and they'll send another one and it'll cause a chain reaction and the whole world become annihilated just completely burnt over and man people will see them little sky things going through the air and then they'll see the big bombs busting and they'll hear it it'll burn this place to exactly what the scripture said that it would do amen even to bursting the earth open to where the volcanics will come forth those volcanics yellowstone how many knows that the yellowstone they talk about yellowstone they'd ever go out and completely wipe out america super volcanoes it won't be hard for god to create a new heaven and new earth it won't be hard for him but create a new eden for us to walk out on amen that's all coming but i don't want to see all that all i want to see is paul saints irena saints martin saints luther saints pentecostal saying message saints oh we're going to meet the lord in the air but i hope we see him right here on a sunday morning sometime i hope one of y'all go i see him maybe he'll just be maybe you'll be scared who knows is it a ghost what is it i don't know but the bible says we'll see our loved ones but braham said we'll see our loved ones just like when abraham went down into the city and it appeared unto many and that right they appeared unto many that's what i see by faith and i say god on a daily basis i want to be pleasing to you help me to look at the future not just the president but the future that's right but they're also you probably thinking of michael your dad amen sister hannah we never know isn't that right anybody might think not people be there we didn't think maybe amen folks it's god i'm glad these all died in faith the bible says folks i want to tell you something if i come down to the door of death i want to die in faith if i don't go by the way the rapture how many wants to have the faith of god hey god i know that you're just done here reach out my hand amen i won't forget but i haven't amen reaching out his hand i don't know what he was reaching for but no doubt the names were coming picked him up amen come and grabbed him took his last breath and the spirit came out and he left amen brother i haven't died very bravely very peacefully amen you didn't see him kicking and squirming i don't want to die i'm not ready to die no he was ready he didn't meet the lord he had confidence he knew that the one had begun to work in him was able to finish it amen i don't know why i got on that but maybe somebody needed a little encouragement amen praise the lord you love the lord abraham look for a city which have foundations look way ahead there's a new city that's being built just for you and me how many believes that i believe many believes there's a better land for us i thought about dramatizing a little bit i'm telling you there's a group of people on the earth that has actually found a place a great wonderful place they're all planning on going to it huh no politics everybody's free and so forth and you know what that's what you and i are doing we're looking for a place there's a group of people here getting ready to leave we're looking for a land like abraham did listen to what he says truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had the opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is and heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god folks i want to tell you if your whole ambition or your goal is for that city and to be with god god is not ashamed to call be called your god amen for he hath prepared for them a city amen moses i love the hero moses because he was supposed to be the next pharaoh let's say he was in the prime of his life he was up next to rule all of egypt that's probably god said he would have had every kind of a pleasure that you could ever have thought of people fanning him never too hot not too cold the best food you could drink of everything that you flesh goodness out he had it all right there and he threw it all away to go and take parts with the slaves because he counted it greater riches to be part of them than it was to be all to enjoy all the pleasures of sin and of egypt are you a witness to hey i don't care about the world's pleasures and all of that i just want whatever the lord wants me to have i would rather be identified with believers i'd rather be called a holy roller fanatic whatever you want to call me but to be a part of god than to pledge enjoy all the pleasures of this leader sia because i'm here to tell you folks you got to watch this thing this thing is like i said everything is geared to drown you spiritually all the pleasures is out there completely legal they're thinking of even legalizing prostitution we know canada we know it has had that for a long time right brother joe we was up there and man it was vulgar amen i don't even want to describe it not even right to speak of it but there we were living in an apartment and things were going on man you know terrible now they want to bring that and say it's all legal folks i'm telling you the devil is legalizing sin and people that want to go that way can but not me not you we are no part of that mess we want to keep ourselves unspotted from the world right in our hearts how many beliefs you got to be right in your heart pleasing to the lord and the one thing in closing if you want to stand with me i want you to think about this that as you become a prayer warrior you get closer to god and as we live the rest of our lives here how many this morning would take a good look at yourself and can you say that you know the footprints that i'm making another could follow i'm making footprints i'm making walking in a way that others can follow it think about that because we are following footprints and somebody's following our footprints it causes you to question yourself and to look at yourself real good and say god help me to set a good example help me to walk in the right way to have a good spirit the right attitude to handle things the way that this is supposed to handle to walk in a way that my children are supposed to walk set an example for our children how many would just be honest in your hearts with heads bowed and eyes closed would captioning not that my available and my daughter those who walking behind me will be able to step into my footprints and they'll be able to kneel down in the place that i kneel down they'll get a hold of the god that i got a hold of they got to let get the love that i got get the salvation that i got get the holy ghost baptism like i got get the love of god like i got live for god the way that i live for god lord that's what we want our hands are raised we say lord help us to walk a father and to make footprints that another can follow each and every one of us lord to be an example lord to those that come behind his father and forgive us this morning of all our failures and false god we ask lord for forgiveness and that you'll wash us in the blood of jesus christ lord make us white keep our hearts pure our minds clean lord we ask god that you'll help each and every one after this morning and this coming week in this memorial day lord this coming week let us each one father if there's ways that we're walking god help us by your holy spirit to

realize that eventually these stars will be closed lord according to prophecy lord don't shut us down god but that's okay we know that there's another door that you're gonna open lord and we're looking forward to that we ask god that you'd help us to be real christians to serve you father to set up an example good footprints lord jesus [Music] that those behind us can follow or touch every heart this morning every repentant heart god that knows they have not been an example like they should be lord they just want you to have the supreme preeminence in their life we ask this in jesus christ's name amen and amen just sing something softly i'll say just keep in prayer we'll have a i mean an altar i know somebody wants to be prayed for and so if anybody else wants to be prayed for
