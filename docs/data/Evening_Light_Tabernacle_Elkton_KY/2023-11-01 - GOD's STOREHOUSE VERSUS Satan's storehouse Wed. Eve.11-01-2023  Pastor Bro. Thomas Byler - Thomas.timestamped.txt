[43:18] that which we feel you've laid upon a
[43:20] heart to minister we T ask God that you
[43:22] would just have the complete preeminence
[43:25] in it Lord have your way tonight for we
[43:28] ask it in Jesus name amen turn your
[43:30] bibles if you will we want to amen we
[43:33] want to basically speak about the
[43:35] devil's Storehouse tonight amen but I
[43:39] titled it God's Storehouse and the
[43:41] devil's Storehouse amen amen so you're
[43:45] going to buy something from one of those
[43:46] folks amen you're going to serve one or
[43:49] the other Master you don't have a choice
[43:52] ain't that right you're either going to
[43:53] serve God or you're going to serve the
[43:55] devil amen amen unfortunately there's
[43:58] too many people that try to do both
[44:00] ain't that right and just make a mockery
[44:03] of it amen we don't want to be those
[44:05] folks in between amen the lukewarm
[44:08] people lay out of
[44:10] sins amen that thought they were rich
[44:12] and increased with goods and had needed
[44:14] nothing but didn't know they were
[44:15] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[44:20] amen want to talk about three different
[44:21] things with the help of the Lord tonight
[44:24] and we want to talk about clothing for
[44:26] just a minute then we want to talk about
[44:28] food and also about drink amen amen so
[44:33] um let me see let's go to the very same
[44:36] scripture I think we used last time um
[44:40] let me see where was
[44:42] it I'm
[44:45] thinking Jeremiah no Second Kings Second
[44:49] Kings 2 Kings
[44:52] 1 this was after ahab's son fell through
[44:56] lattice of course in the upper chamber
[44:59] and went and told his servants to
[45:02] inquire of be elub to God of eon whether
[45:05] he would recover of his disease wow how
[45:09] you want to ask the devil whether I'm
[45:11] going to recover what's he going to do
[45:13] for you he probably pushed you over to
[45:15] lus to begin
[45:17] with is that right so he ain't gonna
[45:19] give a flip whether you get better or
[45:21] not he has his way Jesus said he don't
[45:24] come but to kill and
[45:27] Destroy I'm telling you what the truth
[45:30] of it is the way some people think is
[45:32] just it's just
[45:35] mindboggling that right mindboggling how
[45:38] some people can think amen but verse
[45:41] three it says but the angel of the Lord
[45:43] said to Elijah the tishbite arise go up
[45:46] to meet The Messengers of the king of
[45:48] Samaria and say unto them is it not
[45:50] because there is not a God in Israel
[45:53] that ye go to inquire of the Els above
[45:55] the god of erron notice there it says
[45:58] that ye go to inquire amen of theob the
[46:03] god of e so in other words amen instead
[46:05] of going to God they're going to the
[46:09] devil amen God bless you you can be
[46:12] seated
[46:13] tonight so once again I was thinking
[46:16] about God's Storehouse amen and I
[46:18] certainly didn't get anywhere close to
[46:20] being done with that but amen we uh
[46:23] perhaps will touch on it a little bit
[46:25] more tonight with the help of the Lord
[46:28] amen now how many believes that the
[46:30] Bible has told us well let me go back
[46:33] for just a minute we know that God told
[46:36] Brother random to store up food amen
[46:39] isn't that right to record the tapes
[46:42] record the tapes make messages and so
[46:45] forth and store up food for us amen and
[46:48] so he seen in the vision there was
[46:50] little great big things and very good
[46:52] food to eat so that we could have food
[46:54] here in the end time
[46:56] amen another place one place I believe
[46:58] he said you know when you see Jesus
[47:00] Christ coming and and like he did with
[47:02] the woman at the well Discerning the
[47:04] thoughts and the tents of her heart and
[47:06] telling she had five husbands and
[47:08] knowing that Christ did that in our age
[47:10] thousands of hundreds of thousands of
[47:13] times very same thing never never no
[47:16] fault it was perfect every time amen
[47:19] then brother Braham says you know if you
[47:21] when we see Christ doing that that
[47:24] should give us rapturing faith in other
[47:27] words it scatters all the darkness away
[47:29] amen I don't know about you but when a
[47:32] man comes up here and does and prove
[47:34] something that he says well if you don't
[47:36] believe the proof there's something just
[47:38] a little bit off Ain that right
[47:40] basically going down in the basement
[47:42] saying The Sun Ain't shining when the
[47:43] Sun's shining bright amen but praise the
[47:46] Lord amen so we look at this and I just
[47:48] wanted to read this here before we get
[47:50] started talking about amen we know that
[47:53] a Believer Jesus said whatsoever things
[47:55] you desire when you ask ask in my name
[47:57] and what did he say I will do it he says
[48:01] uh uh you know if you if you only
[48:05] believe all things are possible to them
[48:08] that
[48:09] believe amen so brother B puts it this
[48:12] way the trouble with Christians today if
[48:14] they don't realize what is provided for
[48:16] them many people doesn't realize that
[48:19] the great glories and Powers that's
[48:22] provided for them coming into Jesus
[48:25] Christ is like walking into an arcade
[48:27] down here or a great department store
[48:29] amen I didn't realize you know when I
[48:31] talked about I knew he had said
[48:33] something about Arcade but I didn't
[48:34] realize the department
[48:36] store amen so Christ when can you come
[48:38] into Christ it's like coming into a
[48:40] department store and I thought you know
[48:42] when I begin to think about Christ and
[48:44] all that he has in his store amen it's
[48:47] actually department departmental is that
[48:51] the right English
[48:52] word departmental or something you know
[48:55] Department
[48:56] you know what department means the
[48:58] different departments right and that's
[49:00] the way God is he has different
[49:01] departments in his great
[49:04] store amen there's the shoe department
[49:06] there's the clothing department there's
[49:08] the hunting Department there's the
[49:10] grocery department there's the food
[49:11] department there's this department there
[49:14] whatever department when you come into
[49:16] God's department store there's a lot of
[49:18] areas in our life where we have
[49:21] needs
[49:22] [Applause]
[49:24] amen oh come on how many knows that when
[49:27] you come into Christ Bible says that
[49:29] you're a joint heir of everything he has
[49:33] so when you come into the department
[49:34] store he doesn't say well go pick out a
[49:37] bunch of stuff he says this whole
[49:38] thing's yours go get what you want if
[49:41] you own it you can get what you want not
[49:44] only do you just go shopping folks you
[49:47] own the
[49:48] store let's realize what we got amen how
[49:52] many believe when the one place he said
[49:54] when the bride realizes who she is is
[49:56] the rapture take place woo God help me
[49:59] to realize Who I
[50:01] Am Lord I cuz I want going to leave this
[50:04] place don't

[50:08] believe amen praise the
[50:12] Lord oh my that's right now notice if
[50:17] somebody gave me a great department
[50:18] store down here great arcade and told me
[50:20] that this is all yours well the first
[50:22] thing I do I want to walk around and
[50:23] found out what I own what was mine
[50:26] that's the way it is with Christ when
[50:28] you become a Christian walk around find
[50:30] out what's yours all things are yours
[50:33] given to you freely Paul said things
[50:35] present things in the past and no matter
[50:38] what it is Life Death all things are
[50:40] yours Paul said
[50:41] everything's
[50:45] yours I just said it that way to let it
[50:48] sink
[50:51] in Lord let that sink in everything your
[50:55] whatever you have need of how many knows

[51:29] little harder say God get me I want that
[51:32] devil down there like I said I think it

[51:41] know he's just out of sight so to speak
[51:44] he doesn't bother you
[51:46] anymore smoking doesn't bother you
[51:49] anymore drinking don't bother you
[51:51] anymore but don't bother you anymore
[51:53] greed doesn't bother you you anymore
[51:56] anxiety doesn't pop

[52:22] and and God has a grocery store so to
[52:24] speak or Department stord they both have
[52:26] stores amen God said bring my bring the
[52:29] tithe into my Storehouse that there may
[52:31] be food in my house amen my Storehouse
[52:34] God has a
[52:36] storehouse amen that's what you come
[52:39] here tonight
[52:42] for what' you come for to
[52:45] feed food how many knows food is one of
[52:47] the most important things in the world
[52:50] what's more important than the what's
[52:51] more important than
[52:53] food water
[52:56] amen that's why he says let him that let
[52:58] let the the spirit and the bride say
[53:00] come and he that is a thirst one of the
[53:02] last verses in the whole Bible God said
[53:04] he let him that is a thirst come and
[53:07] drink of the Waters of Life
[53:10] freely I like that because I'll tell you
[53:13] what if you quit drinking you'll die so
[53:16] really water could be considered the
[53:17] water of
[53:18] life amen the Lord I thought that was
[53:23] good praise the Lord now notice walk
[53:26] around see what's yours all things are
[53:28] yours and not only that but you've been
[53:30] given a checkbook with jesus' name
[53:32] signed across there saying whatever you
[53:35] send this check back to the father
[53:37] whatever you ask in the father's name
[53:39] that I'll do so don't be scared to fill
[53:43] it out and also how many knows that you
[53:47] are allowed to ask for big things matter
[53:51] why Prophet God said ask for big
[53:54] things ask ask for the baptism of the
[53:57] Holy Ghost ask God to save you cuz the
[54:00] biggest Miracle level happen is for a
[54:02] person to get saved and have their
[54:03] nature
[54:04] changed amen ask for your children ask
[54:07] for ask for 10,000 worlds
[54:11] worth if you ask for 10,000 worlds worth
[54:14] you're asking for one person's
[54:18] soul that
[54:20] right so when hady Wright was given the
[54:24] power by the prophet God says tell her
[54:28] to ask what she wants how many know
[54:30] brother B would never say that of
[54:32] himself
[54:34] no but he said tell her to ask what she
[54:38] wants well you're poor you could ask for
[54:41] money you know have this child I think
[54:43] was needed healing this that or the
[54:45] other but she asked for the Salvation of
[54:48] her two children two little Ras Rascal
[54:53] making fun him on boys and guess what
[54:58] them boys fell under conviction didn't
[55:01] they
[55:02] immediately I want you to know they had
[55:05] so much conviction until didn't they I
[55:08] know what it was cuz I I believe it was
[55:11] I'm set and see if if I'm a prophet of
[55:13] God see if it don't fall in your lap
[55:15] didn't they come over and fall in her
[55:17] lap that's right so much conviction and
[55:20] felt so bad for how they had their
[55:22] mama and they really wanted to give
[55:24] their heart to God they went on their on
[55:26] their
[55:27] lap amen I don't care you know I don't
[55:31] care anybody could
[55:33] disputed uh however they want to this
[55:36] that or the other I believe God I
[55:39] believe they'll be there
[55:42] amen praise the Lord you love him
[55:44] tonight
[55:46] amen praise the Lord now notice how many
[55:49] knows uh that we're actually coming to
[55:52] the climax of it all now I've preached
[55:54] it but ran across and quote of it butam
[55:57] says Genesis is a planting of the seed
[56:00] and 66,000 years has been the maturing
[56:03] to the Harvest amen and the true church
[56:06] that started in Genesis has come down to
[56:09] the fruit time the fruit amen and the
[56:12] Antichrist that started in Genesis is
[56:14] come down to its fruit and we're just uh
[56:17] in the closing time of the whole world's
[56:20] dispensation or Mortal beings so we're
[56:23] coming down to the very end amen that's
[56:25] what we preached before is that we see
[56:27] that evil and those things like that how
[56:30] did they're coming to maturity in other
[56:33] words they don't even want any policemen
[56:38] anymore they don't want no law they
[56:41] don't want no
[56:43] rules huh that's what they want go back
[56:46] and look under under lawlessness but B
[56:49] says this age will go into
[56:51] lawlessness amen Lawless that's right no
[56:55] law just lead AIA floating and drifting
[56:59] and being tossed with every evil spirit
[57:03] that comes upon
[57:04] them amen but I like this other part and
[57:07] this is kind of off the subject but let
[57:09] me just finish here now notice he says
[57:12] and we're just in the closing time
[57:14] listen and it's the greatest time that
[57:16] anyone or that any age has ever lived is
[57:20] this
[57:22] time oh it's a shaking time it's a
[57:25] Troublesome time for Sinners but it's a
[57:28] marvelous time for
[57:30] Christians cuz why the more we see the
[57:34] world going into complete chaos into
[57:37] complete moral Decay and you feel
[57:41] yourself getting closer to God you
[57:43] realize that we're almost
[57:47] there
[57:49] huh just like going somewhere on a trip
[57:52] are we there yet are we there yet no we
[57:54] got a few miles the back go oh we're
[57:56] almost there we're almost there and
[57:59] that's like what we are that's what we
[58:01] ought to be
[58:02] tonight oh wow this is the greatest time
[58:06] Paul waited for this Arenas waited for
[58:08] this all of them waited they thought it
[58:11] was coming into our day their day but
[58:12] they've been in a place to
[58:15] where it's perfect for
[58:18] him
[58:21] amen they're not bored huh you're not
[58:26] getting
[58:27] impatient however it is over there it's
[58:29] so Sublime isn't that right what the
[58:31] brother Ram said it's so Sublime until
[58:34] it's perfect contentment perfect
[58:36] satisfaction amen amen but you and I am
[58:40] we have to finish the journey okay like
[58:41] I said it's kind of off the subject but
[58:42] when I ran across this am mean I really
[58:45] liked it amen because it is the greatest
[58:46] time for the
[58:48] believer amen we are because we know we
[58:51] are ping up or gathering up the last
[58:54] little efforts to go home to meet the
[58:58] Lord amen let's talk about clothing
[59:03] first I was thinking the other
[59:06] day brother B talked much about it
[59:08] coming down to the river Jordan come
[59:11] down close to close to the coming of the
[59:14] Lord
[59:15] amen and if you leave out of this world
[59:18] and go out of this world or come down to
[59:21] your deathbed or you get in a wreck and
[59:25] men and you are there and bleeding out
[59:29] dying injured so bad you're
[59:32] dying
[59:33] [Music]
[59:34] amen there's some things that you're
[59:37] going to think
[59:38] about amen how you've lived what you've
[59:42] done what's up for you
[59:45] next amen because we have a tendency to
[59:48] think so much about these natural things
[59:51] here when our focus our main focus
[59:55] should constantly be for the other
[59:58] world for what lays
[1:00:00] ahead and I believe B was one brother B
[1:00:04] talked about what was the greatest time
[1:00:05] of his life amen was it a great meeting
[1:00:08] was healing and this out of the other he
[1:00:09] says this is it this is the greatest
[1:00:12] time of my this is what I've been
[1:00:14] looking for that's why in his death but
[1:00:16] he could say that's what I'm looking for
[1:00:19] because he had what he had need of
[1:00:21] amen amen before we go in to talking
[1:00:24] about some of the Devils I want to
[1:00:26] go Amen to Revelations and talk about
[1:00:30] clothing one of the uh one of the main
[1:00:33] one of our things that we have to H have
[1:00:36] and it's something that he uh Jesus said
[1:00:38] in verse
[1:00:40] 18 but I I want to go to chapter three
[1:00:44] and I W to begin with verse four he was
[1:00:49] talking to the Sardis Church age I
[1:00:51] believe it was thou H has a few names
[1:00:54] even in sards which have not defiled
[1:00:57] their garments and they shall walk with
[1:01:00] me in white for they are worthy amen
[1:01:05] praise the
[1:01:07] Lord he that overcometh the same shall
[1:01:10] be clothed in white rment and I will not
[1:01:14] blot out his name out of The Book of
[1:01:16] Life his name before my father and
[1:01:20] before his angels in verse 18 to the
[1:01:25] layout of sins amen of course we know
[1:01:28] how they were they were lukewarm verse
[1:01:30] 16 neither cold nor hot they thought
[1:01:32] they were Rich increased with Goods they
[1:01:34] thought they had need of nothing didn't
[1:01:35] know that they were wretched that they
[1:01:37] were miserable that they were poor blind
[1:01:40] and they were
[1:01:43] naked Amen to be without Christ to die
[1:01:47] without Christ is the most horrible
[1:01:49] thing that a person can ever
[1:01:52] do brother bam said he uh has seen
[1:01:55] people burn up and cars perhaps and all
[1:01:57] kinds of ways that they went he said but
[1:01:59] the worst way that he's ever seen people
[1:02:01] go was to die without knowing
[1:02:06] god now notice here I counsel thee to
[1:02:09] buy of me go try in the fire that thou
[1:02:11] mayest be rich and white Raymond notice
[1:02:15] what you're buying amen you're also
[1:02:17] buying this white rayment
[1:02:21] amen now notice he says buy of me go old
[1:02:25] tried in the fire now we all I've always
[1:02:28] thought of this as the character that we
[1:02:31] have cuz we know that amen uh I think
[1:02:34] was Peter said the trial of your faith
[1:02:36] being much more precious than gold of
[1:02:38] that perishes and so forth and that gold
[1:02:40] is a Christlike character I believe
[1:02:42] brother bam said in the church age but
[1:02:44] you know there's another way that we
[1:02:46] could look at this and that is I counsel
[1:02:48] thee to buy of me gold which also we
[1:02:52] know that gold represents what deity
[1:02:56] right deity tried in the fire how many
[1:03:00] knows that the life of Jesus Christ was
[1:03:02] tried in every way it was deity that was
[1:03:06] tried and the character that you get is
[1:03:10] his character you get that gold you get
[1:03:13] his
[1:03:14] character and that's what we are dressed
[1:03:17] in that is our clothing is his
[1:03:19] Christlike character and make that your
[1:03:23] number one goal from here on out say God
[1:03:25] that's what I want I want to be dressed
[1:03:28] doesn't matter if you come tonight
[1:03:29] tomorrow morning I want to be dressed in
[1:03:32] the goal of your character amen because
[1:03:36] I don't want to come down to that day
[1:03:37] and not have anything on Amen basically
[1:03:41] be found
[1:03:42] naked amen be a terrible thing to be
[1:03:46] found naked amen white Raymond no notice
[1:03:50] that that thou mayest be clothed and
[1:03:52] that the shame of thy naked do not
[1:03:55] appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes
[1:03:58] have that thou
[1:04:00] mayest see amen so we want to make sure
[1:04:04] that we are clothed in God's
[1:04:08] righteousness in God's character Washed
[1:04:12] by the blood of Jesus Christ ready to go
[1:04:16] at any time amen as your pastor I would
[1:04:19] say we never know when we're going to go
[1:04:23] amen and I want each and every one of
[1:04:26] you to be ready subject number two amen
[1:04:29] is going to be found in Jeremiah
[1:04:38] 2 and we going to talk a little bit
[1:04:41] about water drink amen now this is going
[1:04:45] to be interesting
[1:04:47] because
[1:04:53] remember
[1:04:57] that is the number one thing that we
[1:04:59] have to have to live and that is water
[1:05:03] okay Jeremiah 2 and verse 11 hath a
[1:05:06] nation changed their gods which are yet
[1:05:10] no Gods but my people have changed their
[1:05:13] glory for that which does not profit be
[1:05:17] astonished oh ye Heavens at this and be
[1:05:20] horribly afraid be very desolate sayeth
[1:05:24] the Lord for my people have committed
[1:05:28] two evils they have forsaken me the
[1:05:31] Fountain of Living Waters and heue them
[1:05:35] out systemns broken ssts that can hold
[1:05:41] no water most of my rest of my subject
[1:05:44] is going to be out of the message called
[1:05:46] broken sisters
[1:05:49] amen
[1:05:52] amen now
[1:05:54] this is another I I want to say this
[1:05:57] that I truly believe to me this is one
[1:06:00] of the great fruits this is one of the
[1:06:02] big vegetables that the brother bam seen
[1:06:05] when he stored up food amen it was
[1:06:08] called the message of thirst he explains
[1:06:12] amen the basic need of all humans is
[1:06:17] that right me and why they do I'm going
[1:06:20] to fixing the read you why people do
[1:06:23] what they do
[1:06:28] amen butam says it this way now what
[1:06:31] makes a fellow then thirst what makes
[1:06:34] him thirst there's a reason for that
[1:06:37] what makes people want to drink what
[1:06:39] makes people want to be untrue and live
[1:06:42] untrue what makes them desire to join
[1:06:44] churches that indulge in such things as
[1:06:47] playing cards smoking cigarettes and all
[1:06:49] these other kinds of things like that
[1:06:51] it's because God has made man to thirst
[1:06:54] he made you to thirst in other words he
[1:06:57] made us in such a way that
[1:07:01] we we we we were made to worship
[1:07:05] something we were
[1:07:07] made unlike a cow that is completely
[1:07:11] happy mooing all its
[1:07:15] life yeah a sheep that's completely
[1:07:19] satisfied bad all the time dog just all
[1:07:23] my if he gets to bark he's happy all of
[1:07:26] the animal kingdom they're all happy but
[1:07:28] man is not
[1:07:31] happy never satisfied are they that's
[1:07:34] right no they're never
[1:07:37] satisfied God made it that way because
[1:07:40] one thing he gave him a conscience he
[1:07:42] gave him a soul and he give you a mind
[1:07:45] that is Way Beyond theirs and right give
[1:07:49] you a mind to understand Good and
[1:07:52] Evil
[1:07:54] amen and up until the age of about 10 11
[1:07:58] years old he was just as happy as a
[1:08:02] child ain't that right oh my you know
[1:08:05] sometimes they can't hardly contain
[1:08:07] their Joy but when sin comes along evil
[1:08:09] comes along doing wrong comes along amen
[1:08:12] then you begin to amen have a burden on
[1:08:15] you an emptiness that has to be
[1:08:17] fulfilled every human being was made to
[1:08:21] desire fulfillment because he's
[1:08:25] empty
[1:08:27] amen and that creates a thirst a need so
[1:08:30] to
[1:08:32] speak and there's a lot of different
[1:08:34] areas I was thinking today of all of our
[1:08:37] passions and all of the seed taste field
[1:08:39] here uh reason affection and and and
[1:08:43] wanting satisfaction wanting comfort and
[1:08:45] wanting peace and all of these all of
[1:08:47] these things all of these feelings man
[1:08:49] if you just let that all go man you're
[1:08:51] going to be going every which direction
[1:08:54] how many believ that has to be come down
[1:08:56] under under the control of one
[1:08:58] thing amen and I like what brother bam
[1:09:01] says he says all of these things that
[1:09:03] the devil offers in his store I call it
[1:09:07] his substitution his store of
[1:09:10] substitution that's the devil's
[1:09:12] Storehouse because he offers everybody a
[1:09:15] substitute something other than what
[1:09:18] they really need because when you come
[1:09:19] to the house of God how many know you
[1:09:21] get something that's absolutely going to
[1:09:23] F your
[1:09:26] need when you come to Christ it's an
[1:09:29] original it's not a Subs it's not a
[1:09:31] hybrid not to mention man you've got to
[1:09:34] watch this stuff it is deceiving he'll
[1:09:37] poison you he he'll sell you stuff that
[1:09:42] you think is good for you and it kills
[1:09:44] you
[1:09:46] right yeah he's a he boy you want to
[1:09:50] stay out of that
[1:09:51] store but Millions like like
[1:09:54] it Millions like his store you know why
[1:09:58] Millions like his store is because in
[1:10:01] his store they still get to do what they
[1:10:03] want to
[1:10:05] do
[1:10:07] amen ma ma my but he made it listen
[1:10:13] that's why people do what they
[1:10:16] do and that's why you do thirst he made
[1:10:19] you but he made you to thirst after him
[1:10:21] he made you that way and that thirst was
[1:10:25] made in you to thirst after him but the
[1:10:27] devil perverted it and he tries to
[1:10:31] satisfy you with all kinds of
[1:10:35] substitut I don't care what you drink I
[1:10:38] don't believe there's anything that'll
[1:10:39] substitute for
[1:10:41] water amen nothing
[1:10:45] satisfies like pure water isn't it
[1:10:50] amazing how we learned that you know
[1:10:52] it's not good to drink C water because
[1:10:54] of the junk that they put in it so now
[1:10:57] man we will pay $2 a bottle for a bottle
[1:10:59] of water if we need to amen because we
[1:11:02] want something that's good amen but
[1:11:05] people won't go to a church that
[1:11:07] preaches the truth they'd rather go to a
[1:11:09] church where the preacher always just
[1:11:11] doesn't defend
[1:11:13] anybody that's
[1:11:16] right huh CU people like that if you
[1:11:20] don't step on their
[1:11:22] toes
[1:11:24] that's
[1:11:25] right now notice in trying to make you
[1:11:28] be satisfied with trying to quench that
[1:11:30] blessed thirst with sin he says you have
[1:11:33] no right to quench that blessed holy
[1:11:36] thirst with drinking or waiting in
[1:11:39] sin you remember that God made you to
[1:11:43] come thirst after him in righteousness
[1:11:45] and the devil turns it around and
[1:11:48] there's many things that he tries to
[1:11:51] quench it with
[1:11:54] oh yeah let me go just over a couple
[1:11:56] that he says that's the reason people
[1:11:58] don't go to church on Wednesday night no
[1:12:00] more you'd rather stay home and we'll

[1:17:48] carrying on
[1:17:50] immoral that's right now down The Whole
[1:17:53] World's deceived by those things but the
[1:17:56] question is my brother and my sister
[1:17:59] what makes men and women do that if
[1:18:01] they're mentally right what makes them
[1:18:03] do that what makes them crave to drink
[1:18:05] whiskey what makes America want to smoke
[1:18:08] cigarettes and so forth oh my they seek
[1:18:10] and suck on those things for pleasure
[1:18:13] something's wrong what is it they can't
[1:18:14] help it oh my and if the devil can't get
[1:18:17] you all twisted up with some of that
[1:18:19] he'll take you to church somewhere and
[1:18:21] get to get you away from it he just uh
[1:18:23] and you'll be just as bad
[1:18:26] off millions of them going to church be

[1:18:30] their shorts they still want to smoke
[1:18:32] their cigarettes they still want to do

[1:18:36] substitute to church if you don't want
[1:18:40] to be just a rank Sinner and a whiskey
[1:18:41] Drinker God will offer you a place in
[1:18:43] church just don't get born

[1:18:53] whole world like you can have all the
[1:18:54] kingdoms if you just don't go to Calvary

[1:19:11] to tell you that a majority of people
[1:19:13] want to come up some other way that's
[1:19:16] the devil's way that's what he offers
[1:19:18] him some other
[1:19:20] [Music]

[1:26:34] heart that nothing will fill it but God
[1:26:38] and man is thirsting for something that
[1:26:41] real thirst is for
[1:26:43] God nobody's got a right to try to
[1:26:45] quench that Holy thirst with giving it
[1:26:49] to the devil for the things of the world
[1:26:53] amen you've got no right trying to hide
[1:26:57] that Thirst by joining a church God's

[1:27:14] hunger and thirst after right they shall
[1:27:17] be filled and it's God trying to get to
[1:27:20] the human heart and the devil to quench
[1:27:22] that by letting them drink theirself to
[1:27:25] death or run themselves to death or do
[1:27:28] something else but God created man to
[1:27:31] have that Holy thirst

[1:27:48] minute I notice the sister is usually
[1:27:51] where people doesn't have a well they
[1:27:54] get a sistern in other words a sistern
[1:27:56] is a man-made tank or a manmade well in
[1:27:59] the ground that men dig out to use some
[1:28:02] of them use it for wash water and
[1:28:04] drinking water and so forth until all
[1:28:07] the water sometimes that we used to get
[1:28:09] was from a sistern
[1:28:12] amen well notice one thing about a
[1:28:15] sistern that's different from a well a
[1:28:17] sistern will get empty that sistern
[1:28:21] cannot fill it s it's not reliable you
[1:28:24] can't rely upon a sister now remember
[1:28:28] denominations are sisters J
[1:28:31] manmade
[1:28:35] sisters any church that isn't driven and
[1:28:39] powerered by the Holy Spirit Jesus
[1:28:42] Christ is a sistern
[1:28:50] manmade amen you can't rely Ry Upon A
[1:28:52] sistern it has to rely upon the rains
[1:28:55] that fall in the summer and so forth
[1:28:57] usually in the winter time when the snow
[1:28:59] or the rain comes see that's the only
[1:29:00] time that they get
[1:29:02] water Amen Let me I think I'm going to
[1:29:05] read this again a little bit later now
[1:29:08] notice if you'll notice another thing
[1:29:10] about a sister it's usually comes from a
[1:29:13] barn that's twice the size of a house
[1:29:15] usually the Runs run the water runs off
[1:29:17] the barn to a sister now remember we had
[1:29:19] grain pipes coming off of that Barn so
[1:29:21] of the water is carried off of the roof
[1:29:23] where the animals stepping around
[1:29:25] through the staple yards and so forth
[1:29:27] the filth of the Barnyard settles on top
[1:29:29] of that Barn in dry times and that water
[1:29:32] comes down and washes on off the roof
[1:29:33] that's manmade amen and then a man-made
[1:29:36] spout to a manmade sister and boy if you
[1:29:39] haven't got a mess I don't know what you
[1:29:42] have got amen I thought about you know
[1:29:45] you go up on there and they get it off
[1:29:47] the roof you know I don't know about you
[1:29:48] but we always have Sparrow sitting up
[1:29:50] there there's birds that's and have
[1:29:52] their Dum all over the roof dead bugs
[1:29:55] everywhere amen the the dust from the
[1:29:58] patties of the cows up there and it all
[1:30:00] watches down there and you get a big old
[1:30:02] cup full and you say yum
[1:30:05] yum huh sounds pretty
[1:30:09] gross but people like it they're like I
[1:30:12] like that flavor that's actually what
[1:30:14] people
[1:30:16] do now spiritually speaking okay
[1:30:20] spiritually speaking naturally I'm doubt
[1:30:23] they would do that fiercely people will
[1:30:24] drink from
[1:30:26] such huh you mix a little bit of well
[1:30:30] you sisters if you want to just wear
[1:30:31] real tight dresses and have all the men
[1:30:33] looking at you you Brothers want to wear
[1:30:36] a pair of shorts and them had little
[1:30:37] chew I I don't think that be anything

[1:30:47] ghost that really don't matter a little
[1:30:49] bit more door huh

[1:30:57] inclusive big big chunk of stuff right
[1:31:01] there huh you mix that all
[1:31:04] together huh and what you got You' have
[1:31:08] got some kind of
[1:31:13] mess have y'all seen that woman I wish I
[1:31:16] remember her names I've seen her on

[1:31:20] done woman preacher getting up there and

[1:31:29] is some really devil possessed stuff
[1:31:31] right
[1:31:32] there huh you have got you a real mess
[1:31:36] people but people love it why
[1:31:41] amen my that's right it's all man-made
[1:31:46] that's a whole lot like our church this
[1:31:47] St today brother B say I think that we
[1:31:49] have left one of the great sins that the
[1:31:51] church has done
[1:31:54] today just like Israel did then it left
[1:31:57] him the Fountain of Living Water and
[1:32:00] they heed themselves out man-made
[1:32:02] sisters and it has become the habitation
[1:32:06] of everything that love that kind of
[1:32:09] water lizards and frogs and unclean
[1:32:13] germs come in that man-made tank in this
[1:32:17] tank of these things say oh my what a
[1:32:19] perfect of our example of our
[1:32:20] denominations to day amen oh you say
[1:32:25] brother Brandon why do you strike it
[1:32:27] though so hard it ought to be struck out
[1:32:29] it's got to be struck out flee it
[1:32:31] because it'll finally end up in the mark
[1:32:33] of the
[1:32:35] beast think about back in the 60s he
[1:32:37] said those churches man they're full of
[1:32:39] Filth they come the The Habit the what
[1:32:42] is it has become the habitation of every
[1:32:44] unclean and hateful
[1:32:47] bird they've become exactly what the
[1:32:49] prophet of God said they do
[1:32:53] amen amen lovers of such things they
[1:32:58] love that
[1:32:59] stuff
[1:33:03] amen
[1:33:05] my leaving the artisian well for a
[1:33:08] man-made sistern could you imagine
[1:33:11] someone doing that could you imagine the
[1:33:13] mental conditions of a person that could
[1:33:15] drink at a fresh Arian well and would
[1:33:19] leave that for a man-made sister with
[1:33:21] fall and lizards and wiggle tails and
[1:33:23] everything else it don't seem sensibly
[1:33:25] right but that's just exactly what the
[1:33:28] people has done they have left the word
[1:33:30] the true Fountain of God source of power
[1:33:32] to drink out of systems and make
[1:33:34] themselves
[1:33:37] sisters
[1:33:39] amen that's the way it is with a lot of
[1:33:41] these parasites today man they can't
[1:33:43] live in fresh waterer by the holy
[1:33:47] spirit
[1:33:48] amen people can't hear the true
[1:33:52] unadulterated word of God they can't
[1:33:54] handle
