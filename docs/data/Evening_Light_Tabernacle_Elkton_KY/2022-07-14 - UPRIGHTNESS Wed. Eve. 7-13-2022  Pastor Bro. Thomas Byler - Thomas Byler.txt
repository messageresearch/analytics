heads kind heavenly father we come before you lord jesus once again lord thankful to be able to approach your throne of grace lord jesus and father with our needs lord jesus and just our praise and our thankfulness to you for all that you do for us on a daily basis god and for who you are and what you mean to us lord and i as we father just want to try to lord speak father which we at which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak god help us lord just to get out of the way lord that you might speak words that you once said lord lord that might edify then when we have come lord forgive both transgressions all sins all failures we ask god that you put it all under the blood lord jesus so that father we'd be able to hear your voice speaking to our hearts tonight father we ask these blessings and favors in jesus name amen and amen amen all right let me see which way i push that we're green amen at least it's not red so don't take much to figure that one out amen everybody doing all right amen i'm doing better i mean i tell you what sunday i was just still on feeling pretty pretty rough yet so probably from the infection or something i don't know but anyway so we're doing better today so praise the lord amen um if you will open your bibles to the book of job the book of job amen and i want to speak tonight on the definition of manhood definition of manhood we want to talk about uprightness uprightness amen amen in job 1 there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was a perfect and upright and one that feared god and has chewed evil and they were born unto him seven sons and seven and three daughters his substance also was seven thousand sheep three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asks is in a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east and his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone on his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat there and to drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about jobs in and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts thus job did continuously amen let's read verse 8 yet we know what happened there and so forth and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man and one that feareth god and is true as evil amen then satan answered the lord that's job fear god for naught may god has blessings to reading you can be seated tonight amen amen so talk about the definition of manhood many people many times brother brennam says that people judge people by the way that they dress or their stature he says man is not judged by how big he is or how strong his muscles are amen man is judged or should i say defined amen he is defined by character another place he says and he says well right here it says and character alone amen character alone is what makes a man a man praise the lord he said i've seen men that weigh 200 pounds and didn't have one hands of ounce of men about him amen man is judged by character what he is in his heart amen even christ was not judged by his physical strength because how many knows he was despised and rejected of man he was calmly he was not he but there was no beauty in him that we would desire him amen so god doesn't look at any man according to his size another place by the ram says you know man you know he judges a man by the bags in his knees where he's been praying amen i mean that's what makes a man amen amen praise the lord i like what the prophet god say he says you know where's our george washington's abraham lincoln's and so forth and we know those were men were men of god who feared god who believed in god and let me just say this and i'll say it again he says you know anybody that ever was worth anything believed in jesus christ you just don't amount to a hill of beans he said if you don't believe in jesus christ amen why because you have no foundation you have no nothing to anchor to everything saul sales just whatever goes we're living in an age when it's really bad now i was listening to a message called he cares do you care and i was amazed at how brother brandon went seemingly in a complete different direction but he got to talking about science and civilization and and education and where it's taken us amen so um let me just start he says now before we have a prayer line listen closely while we run through these scriptures he says we find after that the world had took its intellectual conception of the world the word that was back in the garden of eden we know eve took it on the intellectual side the education side so to speak right though he called us the the reasoning side with education you have reasoning amen i know faith doesn't have any reasoning but eve reasoned with the serpent about the word of god and it got us into the trouble that we are she did it for higher knowledge more knowledge you will be wise you will be like god you'll know good and evil the devil told her you'll be smarter than you are now you know we really don't care too much about being smarter we just care about being closer to god and thinking god thoughts any time you get away from god now i want to say something here but listen so he says and those men became great men renowned men the bible says in genesis 6 4. men are renowned but they went after the sons of god said all the daughters of men that they were fair right i mean they took unto themselves wives and the bible says that they never god never did forgive him for that amen and he brought it down to this generation flashing red line sign of his coming talking about other women and so forth you know pearl o'brien i believe he mentioned how that she was supposed to be the most beautiful woman and now and even in that day to brother bannon he says there's many and many a young lady that'll outshine her by a long shot and now the world is absolutely filled with a whole world full of pretty women very pretty women but ungodly amen not godly at all amen oh my so you have to you have to just in the i didn't read all this let me read this this is got a little humor in it and i like it now notice he says abraham abraham had to do it and call the things which were not as though they were he believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness what we need today is to wishbone out and a backbone put into christianity is it it's there the thing that we need is a born-again christians men and women who when they'll see trouble rising don't not slip off not fall off not off run off this way and be partakers of the wrong but a man and woman who will stand and show their colors amen how many believes that even your friends will appreciate you more if you'll do that stand for what's right amen we're living in the hour when you've got to take a stand don't you what man is he brother bam says that don't pre-appreciate a woman let her be as ugly as a fence made out of mud and dab with tadpoles that's what he said not me all right be as ugly as she may be but let her be lady in character enough to stand for the woman morals hello any man that comes along and takes off his hat to her if he's got one ounce of man in her in him i mean let me get that right we don't want no mistakes here isn't that right a real genuine man will acknowledge and respect a real godly woman doesn't matter what her she looks like amen that's not what it's all about amen i'll tell you right now anybody looking for a wife you better look for that character because beauty will fade hitler going you gotta you know you know it's that woman and what she is that's what you got to live with i believe another place brother bam talked about how that he had a girl running off after a little young boy that would come and date her and so forth and come to the church and he wouldn't even come to church he would just sit outside in his car probably listen to boogie wiggy or something and wait for her to get out of church and he asked that girl what do you see in that guy well he's got such sleek back hair or something and he smells so good and and got cute toes or something you know and that's from you know and i believe she got in a whole lot of trouble because of that because of the character he didn't love the lord he didn't serve god he had no foundation and then he says i don't care if the boy looks uh what was it smells like a pole cat in his feet like box guards huh man he's got a little overbite i don't know you know just ugly as sin but if he's got character right that's what you look for character praise the lord oh my so then he goes on he begins to talk about this is a little bit talking about the world that we're living in tonight because we're living in a world where people don't know and can't even define what a woman is it's really getting bad out there folks and man we want to look at why it's getting bad because brother man if you want to listen to it listen to that tape 1964 he cares do you care or 63 i believe it is in 707 the month of seven seventh month but he describes it and i'll go into it tonight but it's something how that you know man doesn't you know it's it's pathetic it's absolutely pathetic the world that we're living in this is what this is the this is the words my prophet taught us he says do you know that a certain percent he says almost a third of our high school children over the nation is he has even either been proven to be immoral or had to go home to be mothers and do you know that taking penicillin and different things but now let's go on oh how sin he says oh how sin how subtle it is and how them people their ministers will stand and not preach against them strip jesus on the street and let them sing in the choir and everything like that what brother bran was trying to say is i'm going to show you why that we are where we are okay everything like that and see the very thing that has sent our nation to hell sent our race to hell [Applause] he described it way back there that the preachers and the pulpits and the people have gotten solved and they didn't preach against things and then later in that message he says people are always saying why are you always bawling women out why are you always so hard on this he says the same spirit that tells that person who they are whatever he said that same spirit is calling that thing out and it is telling you where it leads to where that woman smoking a cigarette leads to where cutting the hair leads to ultimately into a complete perversion is that right and that's where he says that's where it's coming from because you got to get right to the root of the problem and that's where the root lays people are not in love with god like they should be they're not where they ought to be and then the things creep in and the preachers don't say anything against it so now the striptease isn't out there in the streets the striptease is walking up and down the aisles here and they're not saying a word about it even then [Music] and that's why the world is in the condition that it's in because pulpits weak pulpits because what what is it this is where the man and the woman get taught this is where they get their teaching is that right this is where it comes from and so this is where it starts amen and he says because of this and the corruption and so forth that's why it has brought our nation and our race and it'll i mean it'll take it right into the great tribulation period where the fire amen that'll consume even the elements shall be that's where it's taking them ma praise the lord another place he says now he cares do you care now we find out kind of sorry here we find out that people won't take god's way first he says but i'm telling you this morning what's the truth and what's facts we're at the end first thing he says before all of that i'm telling you what's the truth and what facts we are at the end [Music] folks how much more is that playing today we're at the end remember many places he says you know uh civilizations at the end the families at the end education at the end who knows they can't barely even have an education they're more concerned about teaching nine-year-olds about sex today than they are about giving them a good math lesson it is terrible isn't it and how many knows whether it's pornography for on the internet and immoral woman walking out there it was immorality that took the world down once it's always immorality that takes the world down corrupts i mean those immorality corrupts and they want to corrupt them at a very young age now that's what they're trying to do corrupt them early and that falls in the line of brother bam says absolutely education is absolutely of the devil well we got to be educated we got to know this but look at what an education goes look at what they're doing with an education amen it's absolutely proven that the prophet was right it is of the devil and it's taking some harm again but tonight i want to look at least a little bit because our influence and the few people that we have still that are trying to be influenced by the right inspiration because what you look at what you read what you listen to what you think and who you admire and who you who you put on a pedestal is what you become like isn't that right so we want to look at job who was a perfect and upright man who feared god and prayed for his children and was in tune with the lord daily continuously huh in order to be upright you got to be perfect now how many knows the human the man you the mankind us kind we're the only ones that really walk upright huh monkeys and chimpanzees they're the closest they may go from one tree to the other rotten but they one time or another they'll take them front feet feet back down again because they're still in the animal kingdom but we're not we walk right and if you run like a monkey i'm really gonna wonder about you why because you was made to walk up right it's not a problem for me to walk upright i'd have a whole lot of problems trying to run like a monkey but they were made that way man was made to be upright and that has a spiritual significant also and that is that everything that you do is to be upright amen he that doeth righteousness the bible says in saint john is righteous amen so how many knows that there's a holiness and then there's a righteousness hello holy and pure before god but you either do everything righteous or you do it unright so let me put it in a simple word it's either not right or it's right there's either unrighteousness or righteousness and man was meant to be righteous before almighty god we were meant to be perfect we were meant to be in the image of god and i wrote down on here i talked about our little imperfections are still little monkey-ness yeah a little monkey-ness in other words not quite upright yet your little mistake is come on get up quit doing that what's wrong but our imperfections says job was perfect and upright he was perfect and right and even jesus says be perfect as your father in heaven is perfect amen uh i hope this goes here and everywhere that as we get closer to christ you're going to hate your imperfections more and more you're gonna oh hate your softness your laziness your ungodliness your unrighteousness more and more all right so he says we find out that people won't take god's way about it and god has a provided way for your comfort god has a provided way forty things how many know that god actually made it a right way for all of humanity that's right but people don't want it people go after other ways amen and every time they do it some other way besides god's way it brings the wrath of god upon them every time that they do it it brings death it brings destruction it brings sin brings everything in when you don't do it god's way amen i like that about job he was perfect it was upright one that feared god and has chewed evil huh he didn't like evil at all tried to get rid of any evil he feared god any man that amounts to anything fears god praise the lord you won't be upright with it you won't be upright without a per daily prayer life i like that song just a closer walk with thee granted jesus daily walking close to thee amen i'm at a place brother's sister said lord i can't even walk without you holding my hand i can't do anything without the lord's hand in it amen praise the lord and i've found that that's the way it's supposed to be but sometimes we think about christ think about god you know a little bit once in a while we'll get into that let me go on so he says all right the next one is and all these things that i have spoken of it brings us to this the world all of these things going after other scientific achievements that going after church achievements going after all these different things has brought us to the end of the world that's the truth i mean it was in 1963 the church world took a major turn they turned down the prophet wouldn't have them in their churches pillar of fire no pillar of fire huh because they went to their reasonings their lead to their understanding because i'll tell you this right now imagine if our schools kept bible at school imagine if they would teach these things in our school every day well i'll tell you this right now they should have they should have had at least 45 minutes of bible study where they teach them right i don't know i don't want to get personal here but i hear i'm telling you the stupid stupidity of people to think they can teach them they come from monkeys and all this other stuff and demoralize them and then wonder what we're going to do about it you're not going to do anything about it they're going to shoot you they're going to destroy you because that's what you raised huh you don't raise children right they'll kill the parents amen there's no end there's no telling but anyway all right now notice it has brought us to the end of the world we're at the end he says there's not one hope left we are without hope of survival we are without hope of survival we haven't even got one chance of survival now let me just break this down just a few minutes and just to prove it to you amen let me talk about each one of you look at the medical journal look at where the achievements and readers digest and so forth he says now a minister here that is sending this message around the world to take a statement like that and we're that we're without hope we're beyond redemption have passed a line between redemption and judgment now i must give the congregation some grounds or basis for this statement there must be some reason that a man if he's in his right mind as i think that i am would make a statement like that to tell his nation tell his congregation to tell the people where it'll go around the world for 30 or 40 different nations maybe around the world and peoples and languages that we're at the end it behooves us to give a statement an explanation a little bit to try to get down to the main text of the morning he says now look at what science and education has brought us that's what he dwells on a lot he says it's the very thing that man accept that instead of the word of god a scientific approval science has always have to take back what they say now where is science brought us now you may be shocked uh just for a moment science has brought us sickness death and diseases that's what's it what's on says look at how sick the world is today all the way down to this covet and the variants and everything else we had enough problems before that showed up but look at where it's at now you say science he says now you're you've only been taught one side of the picture but there's two sides of it you say well science has invented this that and the other now he's talking about electricity he's talking about running water and our cars and all of this how many knows even he said even the cars look at all the crosses on the side of the road look at going down to tennessee to nashville or wherever sometimes you'll see you sign up i haven't seen it lately i don't know if it scared people or what but yeah you know the total number for this year so far in february for this year we've only had 260 killed well i don't know about you but two months 260 that's a pretty big number it makes me want to keep my eyes on the road right my wife i'm telling you my grandchildren are starting to drive for me football keep your hands on the wheel watch the road oh yeah i said well i've been driving almost 50 years down yeah and it kind of shows it gets a little careless oh my but anyway you think about how many knows even the achievement of cars has killed a lot of people and so forth all right let me go on sickness and diseases you've been taught one side there's two sides now we're going to grant you that privilege that's right it's done a lot made life for nice and easy and that right made it a lot easier the scientific things that they've done but they've done another side how many knows that is by hybriding food but let's look at the other side he says science is broad sickness science has brought diseases and death look science is hybridizing has brought death to the generation of foods and things it's got the people so soft the men and the women are made up out of a bunch of muck that's what he called it our bodies the strength that we should have the diseases it should shed off the sicknesses should shut off it don't because of the food that you eat he says we're a bunch of muck there's no structure in it it becomes just a bunch of soft jellyfish huh he even pointed it he even brought it into that people oh my if you and i want to say this if you don't have the spiritual other side if you don't have the original food if you don't have every seed shall bring forth of its kind where would you be where would i be if it wasn't for the spiritual food that we eat that keeps us our minds right thank you jesus for keeping my mind right because it affects people's brains because they sure don't know whether they're man or woman or not now let me just say this god is working in making perfect and upright men and women right a real lady a real man the devil is in the business of making them perverts perverts i went to lowe's the other day i had never seen it before but i went to the men's bathroom and i like it you know beautiful there's a there's a men's bathroom there's a lady bathroom but they had another one over there for the first time and it said unisex i'm like unisex i'm sure what that is but i must mean either i said i'm offended yep take it down i'm offended you know they want to include everybody include me and my feelings take it down i'm offended why because you ain't got no mom ranger you're not sure who it is if it was me i'd have made an extra one i just said anybody because i don't mind i don't mind at anybody bathroom now calm down before you say brother bottle get off the pulpit i don't want you no mo but i like for it to be uh you know anybody i was up here at the hardware at the mennonites hardware and they had one men and women that's fine with me as long as i can go in and close the lock the door right that's that oh my i need to go don't i need to go where to make these decisions and say look let's just get a bunch of doors like that and just say men are women huh and you know you go in there and that's that's either one of them there but i'm offended with unisex i don't read anywhere in the bible god created man he created woman but he never created rheumatoid no you won't find it you won't i don't believe you'll find it anywhere in the bible huh because it's not there man makes that and i looked up in the dictionary i had to look up what that unisex really means because you know it didn't say tran sex that would be self-explanatory right that'd be a certain kind they'd probably be better off doing that let's everybody understand that if you've ever had a sex change use that one yeah you got your own bathroom but don't confuse me about going in there or not huh here we go that's right that's where the world's come to they could have simplified it but then i was thinking all the way to church lord help us here i thought you know i got almost inspired i wanted to do some graffitis i wanted to spray some graffitis on that place go in the dark go up there by the side beside the unisex thing there and paint nice devil with little little horns and coming out of his mouth yeah i'm here to tell you the devil's laughing at that one the devil is laughing saying look what i made them do man have i got him confused i have got he is laughing all of you people thinking all these unicorns the devil is laughing at you he is having a field day with you because he hates real man he hates real women but when you don't know which sex you are he's happy when you actually get so far gone until you'll build a bathroom fork you're really gone huh that's right you know the bible says for a woman for a woman our women are to adorn themselves with uh a meek and the quiet spirit and so forth and and dressed they're to be closed into modest apparel i've got to hear it talks about girls and women having modest apparel and because of the hybriding because of the spiritual hybriding the churches that don't i like the way it is huh oh let's not offend anybody i don't care who the word of god offends i hope this does offend you if you're a sinner and wrong if this wouldn't offend you then boy that'd be really bad how many knows that brother branham talked about that god is a sex segregationist god is a separator he isn't just here to make everybody happy you know he's going to separate the sheep from the goats one's going to go to heaven and have a glorious time the other one's going to burn in hell yeah there's going to be some separation going on oh my when you look at it how did the devil listen how the devil is taking his subjects and it's like watching a uh what do you call that where they have a a show and they have a puppet they have strings right take this finger and it is out of the other and this then the other well that's what the devil's doing with this world with these people taking them to hell take them to totally and he's completely just operating them and he's just moving him around wherever they want to then he'll take him up on the board and the devil's having a heyday he's having a great time taking his ink and just painting all over his little dolls he's got them all painted up to where it'll probably get to where if they seen a fully colored person they're saying boy he's weird huh well that's rare because about everybody's doing it amen making people wear immoral clothes going to walmart as i said unto my wife by the way you know [Music] women going out there with their backside hanging out going in there with tights on their tights now this preacher don't have no problem with our sisters and we're tight but just wear your dress too right they forget to wear the dust come on folks nothing but the puppet the devil's prophet is all people are god help us i don't know about you but i want to be so yielded to god that he can use me however he wants to wherever he wants to lead me where i should go help me to speak the things i should say live the way i ought to live let me be a man god how many desire lord i want to be an upright man i want to be a perfect upright man living in the righteousness of god full of the joy of the holy ghost ready to be going in the rapture but to be like christ let one person paint themselves and lie look i think rodman he was one of the leaders in it you know look at where's god let a famous person do that and look at everybody what brother i'm saying he says there's nobody ever been a man like jesus christ no man like jesus christ he was small and statue nothing to look at but man was he a man he had compassion remember being a man isn't just being burly and roughing me no a real man has kindness and gentleness he's got patience and love huh treats his wife right loves his wife as his own body and if that lady that woman is a real woman or upright woman she is subject to her husband she is his helpmate amen there's nothing in the world like it is that right having a helpmate amen praise the lord but to think of how that the devil is laughing the field that he's having with these people and robbing them of their joy robbing them about any kind of peace they might have you ought to run the owls that god spares you he's got mercy upon you he leads you the right way he leads you in his path i want god's way don't you any other way folks i'm here to tell you any other way is the wrong way that's what the churches did they took some other way just a little deviation that did it now they got to have a council meeting of whether they're going to accept homosexuals as their preachers that's pretty far gone folks or having homosexuals in their congregation or lesbians can you believe messages churches have to address this situation not that we do but i want to hear to tell you right now folks it's going to be all fun comfortable if you have anything to do with it huh there's only one thing for any of them to do that's to repent get right with god if you don't want to do that you need to just hit the door because i don't want you around our young folks with a perverted attitude and mental attitude hello don't want no part of it well anyway didn't mean to say that but is that all right i think so people have become a bunch of monk they don't people don't stand for anything huh i'm just gonna tell you what come to my mind sometimes we we have church on sunday i didn't feel good i was not feeling good sunday but i came anyway and tried to i was gonna try to be here but i sat back then i said man i'm no good here i'm going to bed i went home went to bed i guess because like i don't know i don't know i'm not a doctor but sometimes i diagnose myself so you forgive me if i'm wrong but i thought it was probably from the infection a little bit or something yet because i'm here to tell you i said if this is getting old i don't want to get old sisters chinese ah but anyway i'm feeling better this is this is doing me good right here i'm feeling better all the time praise the lord but i was thinking you know sometimes people get so soft do you live close you can't even make wednesday night huh is that a is that a joke remember you serve god continuously every day i'm here with i'm here to witness man brothers and sisters and that is that when you walk with god i you know i i've had a cow in the calf and of course the one last time i lost but this time i went to pray a lot more lord you know this cow's mother had to have caesarean and she ended up dying so that genetics isn't too good looking for her and plus we got her 200 pounds overweight because we like the feeder too much i mean she was as bad white as she was round and we was expecting twins for sure but sunday night we went back there after mike and them left and so forth and i said well let's go check on it we went back there and there was a little bitty old black baby calf just right there happy and you know and i said thank you jesus thank you lord amen how many knows because god cares you talk about miracle after every little thing i do i try to pray about it first lord i'm trying to get this hydraulic hose on this tractor and i ain't never really done this before so he helped me i was just looking at the the looking at it and pushing it around i cut myself right open just look at that i just lose my finger trying to get this on i got one side on and i said thank you jesus i'll help me get the other side on i can't even walk without him holding on my hand sure enough it went back he went good bought an old tractor for parts sitting in somebody's yard over the russellville way man it was i just bought it for the alternator and the starter and this that or the other right man i was fixing to drive that thing home loaded up it up on the trailer drove it up there and it purrs like a kitten huh but i'll tell you what it was my intention but it was just god hey but every little thing lord help me fix this help me fix that every step you take you know i got to thinking of how that people treat god the world just mistreats jesus how does god put up with all of this how do you do it god you think i'm not god i wouldn't have been this long suffering but he's long suffering no doubt that's his answer back thomas i'm long suffering not willing to anybody perish so i'm giving them a little more time so just keep preaching a little more they got to hear it maybe one more time another chance there's still mercy there i don't care how scribbled the devil has scribbled on you i don't care how fully she's made you look like amen it used to be when we got up out of bed we put our pants on now they put their dresses on women used to put their skirts on now they put pants on huh uh if that it's a terrible world folks ready for the fire and the long suffering of the lord is about over we're just about at the end how many knows we are just about at the end amen and we need to keep feeding on spiritual food amen i don't believe that what i'm feeding you is hybrid food now you need to have compassion on sinners and in sin and you need to be understanding of this that and the other yeah you should be maybe but still call black black and light white let people know where you stand so they don't misunderstand where you stand amen my we go to dairy queen everybody says good morning how can i help you or after you come by they say here you go thank you and they thank you for you know have a great day i mean those that's more we get more than god gets people don't get up and say lord jesus how are you today i hope you have a great day how many does that good morning jesus have a great day i don't understand it all but i hope you do huh every little thing he does thank you lord thank you lord be yourself giving thanks for all thanks they do they thank you you thank you one another but do people thank him no people forget him people forget to fellowship with him he sits off in the corner like simon's house amen sits on the corner and nobody pays him no attention nobody entertains him how many believe we need to entertain the lord you need to entertain the holy spirit a little more talk to him fellowship with him walk with him every day pray without ceasing be thankful because you can't be upright man without prayer amen the bag's in your knees that's what makes you a man the closer you are to god the more of a man you're gonna be daniel remember three times a day they shut him down said don't you pray to any other god he kept praying he was an upright man god honored him am i right he was close to god he walked with god brother branham was a good example not as good as jesus but brother bannon was a good example he walked so close to god walked uprightly tried to do everything right how many knows that brother branham tried to do everything right i don't care where i was out in the woods or what he was on the road driving whatever it was all we wanted to do everything right so much so that god himself of course he spoke to him he's earned the thoughts and the people's heart declared him this out of the others thus saith the lord but several different times he says now you say something you say something you're my son you're upright man i trust you tell what happens with this storm and he says it'll go and it'll shine nice for three days and just like that the clouds part had son for three days he was so upright so so godly until he could say now say what you want to that couple that is being totally disorderly and so forth no he didn't kill him no he didn't walk him out drive walk carry him out like an eye but he says i forgive you for that you know i wonder what happened to that couple i really do i know there's one thing i hope that they've seen so much of god that they got saved i should hope that they didn't go out there and blaspheme the holy ghost or something and say something evil against it still and you know i don't know which way they went but i hope that they seen so much of god they repented give their lives to god amen but i get to thinking folks how that sometimes we mistreat the lord we just don't care for god that we should the whole world don't care about god isn't it sad that any human being brother john any human being on the earth would say well i don't know if there really is a god there ain't one of them ought to say that because all they have to do is look around and see creation and look at the evidence of the perfect cycle of the worlds and so forth and wait holds and say there's got to be a god they should all humming beliefs they should all accept the gospel that christ died for every last one of them the only way out is through christ the only hope we have is the rapture because this world he says is doomed because of the course that people took on the scientific side they're feeding the things that's killing us bringing all kinds of diseases he goes into quite a bit more here but i'm not going to go into it but he says the structure of the human being has become nothing but a bunch of muck he was talking about baseball and the different things where he can't hardly do it anymore these in these weaknesses and inbreedings of foods causes cancer mental troubles all kinds of diseases setting in upon the human body because of its weakness scientific destroying themselves getting away from god's plan and god said let every seed bring forth of its kind amen how many beliefs we're living in the hour when it's time for us to be perfect and upright perfect and upright and one that feared or reverenced god i wonder both here and out there listening i wonder if we reverence god enough do we reverence him enough do we respect him enough because our actions shows whether we do or not the things we do show whether we do or not let our every action speak that we respect and fear the lord and pray for our children for one another like job did continuously continuously just a closer walk with thee amen granted jesus is my plea daily walking close to thee let it be dear lord let it be how many is with me let me walk daily right by side amen said it might be pleasing to you him god bless you let's stand musicians if you'll come i want to start at least with this song that says lord i can't even walk without holding without you holding my hand
