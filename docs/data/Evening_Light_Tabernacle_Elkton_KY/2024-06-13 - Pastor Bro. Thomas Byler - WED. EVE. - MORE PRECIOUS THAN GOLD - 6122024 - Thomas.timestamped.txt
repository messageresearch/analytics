[40:39] verse amen let's go with U verse three
[40:43] blessed be the god of our Lord Jesus
[40:46] Christ which according to His abundant
[40:49] Mercy has begotten us again unto a
[40:52] lively hope amen I like that Lively hope
[40:55] don't you amen by the the resurrection
[40:58] of Jesus Christ from the dead to an
[41:01] inheritance Incorruptible and that the
[41:04] that and undefiled and that fadeth not
[41:07] away reserved in heaven for you that's
[41:10] some big and heavy words right there
[41:13] amen who are kept I like this one who
[41:16] are kept by the power of God
[41:31] full temptations that the trial of your
[41:34] faith being much more precious than of
[41:36] gold that perishes though it be tried
[41:39] with fire might be found unto praise and
[41:41] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[41:44] Jesus Christ reations 3 amen and
[41:48] 18 Revelations 3 and 18 and then I want
[41:52] to back up am me and pick up just a
[41:54] couple of thoughts here amen with the
[41:56] help of Lord Lord and will just start
[41:59] somewhere amen and stop somewhere amen
[42:03] because there's no really any beginning
[42:04] or End Amen all right so 18 3:18 I
[42:09] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[42:12] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[42:15] white rment that thou mayest be clothed
[42:17] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[42:19] not appear and I ano th eyes with I have
[42:22] that thou mayest see as many as I love I
[42:26] rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore
[42:29] and repent may God add His blessings to
[42:31] the reading of the words you can be SE
[42:34] be seated amen
[42:43] um
[42:46] amen I'm not exactly sure what how I
[42:49] titled this amen I titled it the gold of
[42:52] God but then I told my wife to title it
[42:55] more precious than gold more precious
[42:59] than gold
[43:01] amen how many has a desire in their
[43:04] heart Amen to see more of God and to see
[43:09] more of the power of
[43:13] God Amen somehow to see the release a
[43:17] more of a release of the power of God
[43:21] amen amen that's no doubt what every one
[43:23] of us amen desire to have and so tonight
[43:27] we want to go in just a little bit
[43:29] different direction Something That We're
[43:31] all very familiar with something that
[43:33] I've preached so many times amen until I
[43:35] don't really want to preach on it
[43:37] anymore but if the Holy Spirit tells me
[43:40] to preach on it again we'll preach on it
[43:41] again amen because how many believes it
[43:44] must be necessary if God keeps bringing
[43:47] us this back to us amen amen it has to
[43:50] do with trials it has to do with
[43:52] suffering it has to do with amen the
[43:54] gold of God trials amen something that's
[43:58] more precious than gold amen and so
[44:01] tonight as we begin to think about power
[44:04] we realize that the prophet of God said
[44:06] that you know power without what is is
[44:10] satanic power without character is
[44:14] satanic and so we realize that God uh is
[44:18] always wanting to give us more of his
[44:21] power he's wanting to give us more of
[44:24] himself isn't that right amen and so so
[44:27] so that we can have those things that we
[44:29] desire to have and we're certainly
[44:31] living in an age brothers and sisters
[44:33] that's a real testing age it's a real
[44:35] trial age isn't that right every age
[44:38] that ever was down through any time
[44:41] period always had their tests always had
[44:44] their trials isn't that right always had
[44:47] the things that they had to
[44:49] overcome amen for example 68 million
[44:53] through the Dark Ages had to be willing
[44:55] to have their heads sh chopped off to be
[44:58] burned at the stake to be fed to Lions
[45:01] to be thrust through with a sword every
[45:03] imaginable way of death that you can
[45:06] imagine amen horrible horrible horrible
[45:10] things that happened to Christians but
[45:13] yet by the grace and by the power of God
[45:16] they were able to
[45:17] overcome amen because we already know
[45:21] that there's only one thing that you
[45:22] take out of this world only one thing
[45:24] that you take out and I want to ask
[45:27] something a little different to it amen
[45:29] it is the very thing that God Treasures
[45:31] the most and it's what God wants out of
[45:34] us and that is
[45:37] character amen character is a nature now
[45:42] first of all I want to first talk a
[45:43] little bit about the Old Testament we
[45:45] could come all the way up down through
[45:46] there but let's talk about the power of
[45:48] God in manifestation now I know uh let
[45:52] me just bring a quote up if I could amen
[45:55] we'll jump over here a few back here I
[45:58] don't have very many he says a man under
[46:00] pressure is what he is under pressure
[46:03] isn't that right the true real
[46:05] characteristics will show when he's
[46:07] under pressure so one of the things that
[46:10] really brings out the power of God is
[46:18] pressure amen how many knows trials are
[46:24] pressure tests are pressure and every
[46:28] son that comes to God must be chasen
[46:32] must be tried must be
[46:35] tested
[46:37] amen because before you can really if
[46:40] you're really going to have more of the
[46:41] power of God you're going to have to
[46:44] have more
[46:47] character
[46:49] amen amen and character is just never
[46:52] made on a flowery bed of ease character
[46:55] comes through suffering and mo and so
[46:57] forth amen but we always see that God
[47:01] brings us into tight places into
[47:04] pressure points so to speak I don't like
[47:07] it you don't like it I pray that God has
[47:10] already tested me tried me amen and that
[47:13] I've passed the test that I ain't got to
[47:15] take it anymore that's the way I feel
[47:16] about
[47:19] it a couple of amens but hey if you just
[47:22] want more go ahead and raise your hands
[47:24] say God just give me some more of that
[47:26] you know
[47:27] I'm
[47:30] tough oh man if you ask for you're
[47:33] probably going to get how know you
[47:34] better be careful what you ask for but
[47:37] even asking for the power of God if you
[47:39] want more of the power of God God has to
[47:41] bring you to those places to where he
[47:43] can show his great power isn't that
[47:46] right it was when uh that Israel come to
[47:49] that Red Sea and that pressure of Amen
[47:51] not being able to go forward up down or
[47:53] other any other
[47:55] way isn't that when God stepped on the
[47:59] scene that's when he stepped on the
[48:01] scene that's when they begin to see the
[48:03] power of almighty
[48:07] God
[48:09] Amen praise the
[48:12] Lord why does God let troubles come God
[48:16] harnesses
[48:18] troubles he puts bits in the mouth and
[48:20] makes it obey
[48:23] him God speak today
[48:27] don't you just love to meet somebody
[48:29] that when the pressure
[48:32] comes when the pressure's
[48:35] on when the trial's
[48:37] there they can stay
[48:42] calm they don't get all excited about it
[48:46] they don't get all frustrated about it
[48:49] they just say well just hold on don't
[48:51] get all excited you know it's not that
[48:53] big a deal God will take care of it just
[48:55] put your faith in
[48:57] God God loves that he loves
[49:02] that amen listen and God harnesses it
[49:08] I've even I've even heard brother Daniel
[49:09] gon say man if you got troubles and
[49:12] trials and not terrible things happen to
[49:14] you don't blame the devil blame
[49:17] God I was like what what's this man
[49:21] saying all these troubles and trials and
[49:23] everything come to you way yeah how many
[49:25] knows he harnesses he put bits in his
[49:28] mouth he don't let anything to happen to
[49:31] you without his
[49:34] permission I got to thinking how how
[49:36] many believes like sister Sher and you
[49:39] know that cancer that claims that she
[49:41] that it's on you know she says I'm in
[49:43] God's hands that's what every one of us
[49:45] want to say I'm in God's
[49:48] hands ain't that
[49:50] right amen and if God allows troubles to
[49:53] come if he allows disease to come
[49:55] brother bam said he allows it amen to
[49:58] show his power amen and to give you a
[50:02] testimony so that you can say boy I was
[50:05] in trouble boy a bunch of bad stuff
[50:07] happened to me but I got on my knees and
[50:09] I trusted God and I just give it to him
[50:11] and man and he worked it all out God
[50:15] gets the glory I'm here to tell you
[50:16] that's the kind of God that I
[50:21] serve that's where you see the power of
[50:25] God in tight
[50:28] places in pressure
[50:31] places that's where he loves to show up
[50:34] in the darkest of our then Jesus
[50:40] comes amen desperation when people are
[50:43] in desperation Dan when Jesus
[50:47] comes amen that's when the power of God
[50:52] many times is
[50:54] released amen
[50:57] because uh whether you know it or not a
[51:00] lot of times it's not you being under
[51:03] test it's God under
[51:06] test ain't that right when do three
[51:09] Hebrew children says we don't know if
[51:11] God's going to whether he's not but
[51:14] we're not going to bow to your image
[51:15] because we believe him let me tell you
[51:17] God was under under test we're g to find
[51:20] out whether God's going to deliver these
[51:21] boys that truly trust them with trust
[51:23] him with his lives or not ain't that
[51:26] right
[51:27] they trusted God with their
[51:30] lives it have been just a little sad if
[51:32] God wouldn't have showed
[51:34] up well they thought maybe he'd come but
[51:37] they're crispy fried down
[51:41] there huh cuz that's what they'd have
[51:44] been seven times hotter than
[51:47] original that's right but God said no no
[51:51] no no no uhuh I'm coming on down the
[51:54] Angels wanted to come down Angels come
[51:57] up and said man I'm the angel of water
[51:59] I'll flood that
[52:04] place I like I'm so glad that we're
[52:06] serving a God that cares about what you
[52:09] say about
[52:10] him I forget just what it was I seen it
[52:13] on YouTube where where where a country
[52:15] and and they had a big parade and they
[52:17] were mocking Jesus a't that right few
[52:21] days later that whole city almost was
[52:23] drown hundreds of them was lost
[52:26] mudslides just a catastrophe happened to
[52:29] that town God's not
[52:32] mocked another boy just some old boy

[52:50] ain't even saying it
[52:54] again he said don't ask me to say it
[52:57] again I'll never say it again not after
[52:59] that experience why God knows God is
[53:03] listening when you testify and when you
[53:06] believe God God hears he said he knows
[53:09] and he won't be mocked and he gets put
[53:12] under the test is he going to come on
[53:14] the scene or
[53:15] not

[53:22] unconditional Covenant that I saved you
[53:24] I saved you I put your name on the book
[53:27] he that have begun a work good work in
[53:28] you will perform it until the day of
[53:30] Jesus how many's relying on that I'm
[53:33] relying on God's
[53:36] power not my ability Adam in a perfect
[53:39] State couldn't keep his word man can't
[53:42] keep his word so God says I'm going to
[53:44] save you despite
[53:45] yourself wo my goodness if that don't do

[54:32] God
[54:34] Amen isn't that right that's
[54:37] right oh my brother bam says you know
[54:40] there was no rainbow until after the
[54:41] flood after Noah after Noah was pressed
[54:44] into that condition that he was in to
[54:46] float 40 days and 40 lights and nights
[54:48] in a storm little Ark pitching up and
[54:51] down the water and so forth but after it
[54:53] was over Dan he saw the rainbow the
[54:55] Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise

[55:00] tribulation then he saw the promise
[55:02] that's the way that you see the Promise
[55:04] after you've went through the
[55:06] tribulation I like the poem must I be
[55:09] carried home on a flowery bed of ease
[55:11] While others fought to win the prize and
[55:14] saes of bloody
[55:15] Seas

[58:11] says where Paul said rejoice in the lord
[58:14] always rejoice in the lord always and
[58:17] again I say
[58:20] rejoice how many believe we ought to
[58:23] Rejoice a little bit we ought to have a
[58:25] little happiness when we realize what we
[58:27] got this is what we're doing showing you
[58:29] a little bit of what we got why we ought
[58:32] to be the happiest people why we ought
[58:34] to be rejoicing Paul in the state he was
[58:37] in would tell us all Rejoice
[58:40] Rejoice always and again I say rejoice

[58:53] me character that's been tried
[58:57] how do you get that
[58:58] character through the holy
[59:01] spirit amen the Holy
[59:05] Spirit now before I go into my thought
[59:09] let's see let's pick up a little bit of
[59:10] the Old Testament talking about David
[59:12] how many knows David was you talk about
[59:14] the power of God
[59:16] right David the Israelites they were all
[59:21] pinned

[59:25] while and mocking us
[59:27] right come on over come
[59:29] on Amen Let me and him fight let's not
[59:32] get all these other guys killed just me
[59:34] and him and if I win y'all serve us if

[59:40] right amen David full of the power of
[59:43] almighty God ain't that right another
[59:45] time when they were down in a tight
[59:47] Place said God come on the scene he got
[59:49] in a ruddy little
[59:52] fell how many how many wants to meet
[59:54] David I'm gonna meet David I want to
[59:56] shake his hand but Brad I don't know if
[59:59] he'll be this high or as tall as me I
[1:00:02] don't know really what little it was or
[1:00:03] just how big he was but he was a Rudy
[1:00:05] little
[1:00:06] fellow how many knows Moses the
[1:00:08] Israelites are short people so he's
[1:00:11] probably like this he's probably
[1:00:14] short but your size ain't got nothing to
[1:00:17] do with it it's how much a God that you
[1:00:20] got in your
[1:00:21] heart oh I like that I don't care how
[1:00:24] inferior you feel insignificant you feel
[1:00:27] just get God in your heart and lot the
[1:00:29] side of that inferiorities so better go
[1:00:31] by the
[1:00:33] wayside why because you got God and you
[1:00:35] ain't got to fear
[1:00:37] nothing amen I want to shake his
[1:00:40] hand Fearless but yet how many knows
[1:00:44] that he still had a character
[1:00:47] flaw Beth Sheba and all the problems
[1:00:51] that come his way ain't that right so
[1:00:54] what we need brothers and sisters we we
[1:00:56] need
[1:00:57] power Amen to become the sons of God
[1:01:01] Amen it takes a lot of power it might
[1:01:03] take a lot of power am me to bring a
[1:01:04] giant down or to slay all them
[1:01:06] Philistines or to kill a bear or a lion
[1:01:08] but I'm here to tell you there's
[1:01:09] something that's more and that's bigger
[1:01:12] and that's that old carnal nature of
[1:01:14] ourselves that's our own
[1:01:16] ways hello and we want to slay Giants we
[1:01:20] want to cast a bunch of devils out and
[1:01:22] we can't even control
[1:01:24] ourselves we can't even treat our wife
[1:01:26] right or husband right we can't be
[1:01:28] obedient to our
[1:01:30] husband we can't love our wife right we
[1:01:32] can't even overcome our
[1:01:35] ownselves come on folks I think it's

[1:01:55] bunch of muck and jelly back boneless
[1:02:00] spineless horrible muck that we're
[1:02:02] living in man has become nothing but a
[1:02:04] muck but in the age of muck and Mar
[1:02:07] God's going to have somebody with
[1:02:08] backbone he's going to have somebody
[1:02:10] with strength and power and
[1:02:12] musles Faith manhood and
[1:02:17] Womanhood

[1:03:05] serving a living God not Buddha Muhammad
[1:03:09] or any of those other religions they're
[1:03:11] all fake and false and wrong Jesus
[1:03:15] Christ is the only real true religion
[1:03:18] none of the other religions are right
[1:03:20] only this Bible amen praise the Lord
[1:03:24] that's right David was great Moses was a
[1:03:27] great man delivered Israel did all of
[1:03:29] those
[1:03:31] things sad part was in the end of it
[1:03:36] Moses almost had to say like brother
[1:03:38] brandham said all of these campaigns and
[1:03:40] all these meetings every he says it's
[1:03:42] all a
[1:03:45] failure didn't he say that he did it's
[1:03:47] all a failure where's it at today if it
[1:03:52] wasn't what was it that the brothers
[1:03:54] were texting to Baptists are now taking
[1:03:56] the vote whether women can become
[1:03:58] pastors
[1:04:03] Baptists as far as I know Pentecostals
[1:04:06] probably already have it right they're
[1:04:08] further away than the Baptist are who's
[1:04:10] left you and I are left God's going to
[1:04:14] have a people that stay with his word
[1:04:17] that stay virtuous to the word of
[1:04:20] God help us
[1:04:22] Lord amen it's a treacherous hour that
[1:04:26] we're living in but God's going to have
[1:04:29] somebody I'm so glad of
[1:04:32] that amen Moses delivered the people he
[1:04:36] did all of that and as I was saying
[1:04:38] Moses at the end what was it two out of
[1:04:40] two million that went in that's why I
[1:04:42] was saying it was a failure why because
[1:04:46] them people's nature was never changed
[1:04:49] they came out under the cloud Paul said
[1:04:52] they' seen the pillar fire they followed
[1:04:54] the prophet but Jesus said there
[1:04:56] everyone
[1:04:58] dead the only ones that went in were
[1:05:00] their children that they had isn't that
[1:05:02] right their children went in and Joshua
[1:05:05] and
[1:05:07] Caleb Moses a mighty deliverer but
[1:05:10] couldn't even go in himself because he
[1:05:12] didn't have enough
[1:05:17] power what was that power to control his
[1:05:20] temper not to strike that rock twice
[1:05:24] wasn't supposed to do that his temper
[1:05:26] got in the way his old carnal self got
[1:05:28] in the
[1:05:30] way are you reading between the lines
[1:05:32] how many knows it's our own selves and
[1:05:34] our own caral ways amen our own
[1:05:37] character that's still withholding the
[1:05:39] power of
[1:05:42] God I wish I could play what I played on
[1:05:45] my my little voice memo man my my wife
[1:05:49] listening to it and she was screaming
[1:05:51] amen hallelujah on my V voice memo I
[1:05:54] said you know a lot of times people pre
[1:05:56] they expect the preacher to be perfect
[1:05:58] to be
[1:05:59] preaching
[1:06:01] huh they you expect me to have reach the
[1:06:03] epitome of perfection amen even the
[1:06:07] prophet himself had to gradually grow
[1:06:09] and grow and grow isn't that right he
[1:06:11] had mistakes and he had to make things
[1:06:13] right that's right well I'd love to say
[1:06:15] brother Brad I'm there I'm there at
[1:06:17] Perfection you'll never see me do any
[1:06:24] wrong wouldn't that be a disappointing
[1:06:26] service boy that preacher just lied like
[1:06:28] a
[1:06:30] dog I know he ain't never going to make
[1:06:32] no mistakes yeah I know he's going to

[1:30:43] my and if I this just comes I don't have
[1:30:46] this really wrote down but but says
[1:30:48] because one man got out of his
[1:30:51] place one man got out of order
[1:30:55] that's why it's so important to preach
[1:30:57] keeping the order of the
[1:30:59] spirit

[1:31:03] you what right now I'll preach against
[1:31:04] gossip more than anybody else I'll
[1:31:07] preach against them things and and
[1:31:09] discontent and people griping and stuff
[1:31:12] I'll preach against it hard because I
[1:31:14] know what happens I know what that stuff
[1:31:16] Brews it Brews horrible horrible
[1:31:20] things carnality in a church is absolute
[1:31:23] poison

[1:31:26] cancer you don't want
[1:31:28] it
[1:31:30] amen Lord help
[1:31:34] us well it's just too hot or it's just
[1:31:37] too cold the preacher he just he just
[1:31:40] screams too much it bothers me if it
[1:31:43] wasn't that you'd say he's just kind of
[1:31:45] dead and dried up what's wrong with
[1:31:49] him

[1:32:02] that's exactly right that's a pastor I
[1:32:04] know it's the one that's discontent the
[1:32:06] one causing the stir ain't right why
[1:32:09] because we should always strive for the
[1:32:11] unity of the spirit Unity of the
[1:32:15] faith

[1:39:16] and in our lives so that you could be
[1:39:18] pleased Lord and say that's my son
[1:39:22] that's my daughter that's how I want
[1:39:25] them to be even as the prophet claimed
[1:39:28] one I believe that he had come to full
[1:39:30] surrenderance to you Lord that's our
[1:39:33] heart's desire that we come to that
[1:39:34] place where we're fully in your hands
[1:39:38] and everything that we do is pleasing to
[1:39:40] you Lord and you don't have to chastise
[1:39:43] us you don't have to correct us Lord
[1:39:46] father because we come to the place that
[1:39:48] we're supposed to be Lord and I realize
[1:39:51] father that'll probably be all the way
[1:39:52] to the end but God God we thank you Lord
[1:39:54] Jesus for where you have brought us from
[1:39:57] and how you've changed us Lord we see a

[1:40:17] one of us Lord take out the old bad
[1:40:20] habits the old character different
[1:40:21] things God that is unlik like you

[1:40:27] over father from our lineage of our
[1:40:29] families Lord Jesus and I know even
[1:40:32] berer Lord Jesus there's things that are
[1:40:35] not good Lord that I have to battle Lord
[1:40:37] and I pray take that all away May that
[1:40:40] to be the heart's desire of each one
[1:40:42] Lord father we only are interested in
[1:40:44] one thing and that is to reflect Jesus
