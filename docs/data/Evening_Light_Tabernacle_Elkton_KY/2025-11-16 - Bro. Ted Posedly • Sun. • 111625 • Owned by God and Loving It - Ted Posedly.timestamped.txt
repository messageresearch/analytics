[51:32] morning and get what we have need of
[51:34] this morning cuz I believe he's an
[51:35] ontime God this morning. Amen. And you
[51:40] know, I I was praying for our children,
[51:43] different ones children, Brother Joe's
[51:45] children. I thought, "But God, you're an
[51:47] on time God this morning." He'll bring
[51:50] him in. That's what we're trusting him
[51:52] for this morning. Well, he's an on time
[51:56] God. Oh, yes, he is.
[52:00] Well, he's an on time God.
[52:06] Yes, he is. is where he may not come
[52:12] when you want him, but he'll be there
[52:15] right on time. Oh, he's an unkind
[52:20] God.
[52:22] Yes, he is. Once again,

[52:28] God.
[52:30] Yes, he is.
[52:33] Well, he's an God bless you, buddy.
[52:38] Love you my friend.
[52:42] May not come when you want
[52:46] be.
[53:13] got me all stirred up.
[53:16] It's good to be happy, isn't it?
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Happy in the Lord no matter what. Amen.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're a little happier than
[53:24] we've been,
[53:26] but we're not as happy as we're going to
[53:28] get
[53:29] &gt;&gt; because it's just getting better and
[53:31] better. Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; It's becoming more real, isn't it?
[53:35] &gt;&gt; He his word,
[53:37] &gt;&gt; our love for one another. It's more than
[53:39] just feeling.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; It's just something that won't leave
[53:42] you. Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; I appreciate that. And so I'm happy to
[53:46] be here with my dear friend, Brother
[53:47] Thomas and Sister Donna, and the and the
[53:50] family, Brother Caleb. And I'm the
[53:52] blessed one, the first one to ever sleep
[53:54] in that new house over there. I'm
[53:57] telling you, I've been sleeping good
[53:59] there. I may just hang around
[54:01] I may just I may just claim it,
[54:06] but you know, if you got brothers and
[54:08] sisters everywhere you go, I've been in
[54:10] a lot of places where they just give me
[54:12] their house or something, stay in there,
[54:14] and you know, it's given only for a
[54:17] temporary time. You know, you can't stay
[54:19] there forever. So, anyway, but it's
[54:23] going home time, people. Amen.
[54:26] This bride has to make herself ready.
[54:29] And we know that's just by accepting
[54:32] what he wants to do in us
[54:34] &gt;&gt; because we can't do it oursself.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; That's why he he didn't leave us alone.
[54:38] Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; And thank God he doesn't leave us alone.
[54:42] Right.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he bothers me when I'm when I'm
[54:45] not where I should be. Aren't you?
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen, saints. Well, I won't hold you
[54:50] standing too long. And uh but I just
[54:53] like to greet you from our church back
[54:56] home and brother George our acting
[54:59] pastor and sister Brandy. And I think we
[55:03] needed Southern in our church.
[55:07] And God sent brother George. We were
[55:09] praying three full years that God would
[55:12] send us a a younger pastor and that the
[55:15] old the old man could kind of, you know,
[55:18] be put out to pasture.
[55:22] And so I'm not pastor now, I'm
[55:24] pasturing.
[55:26] And uh but since then, I've been able to
[55:29] travel a little and I'm glad I'm here.
[55:33] And uh I've got a little rusty in
[55:35] preaching, but you'll never lose your
[55:38] calling.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without
[55:40] repentance. So, it's good to see you all
[55:43] and I won't hold you any longer, but
[55:45] brother George did want me to tell you
[55:46] hello and uh pray for them. I think he's
[55:50] we've got brother Ben Puit preaching
[55:52] over there for us today. So, uh, and
[55:55] sister MNA sends her love to all you
[55:57] sisters and and, uh, even Joel said,
[56:01] "Tell those people hi from me." You
[56:03] wouldn't know him now, of course. 44
[56:06] years old, the little guy. Well, I tell
[56:08] you what, and he he's uh you know, he
[56:12] that teenage thing, you know, when kids
[56:14] get teenage and they know everything,
[56:16] &gt;&gt; they're supposed to go away after a few
[56:18] years, but sometimes it endures longer,
[56:21] you know,
[56:22] and so uh but anyway, he's the son of
[56:26] God, but I know it and my wife knows it,
[56:29] but he hasn't caught that yet, but it'll
[56:32] catch on. You know, you can't force
[56:34] things to happen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; And that's what's been tried with him
[56:38] and different ones tried it and stuff.
[56:40] And you know, when you see it done
[56:42] wrong, all you can do to correct that is
[56:44] just do the right thing. Don't tell
[56:46] anybody, you know, where they hurt
[56:48] somebody or something. That's between
[56:50] them and God. But there's been a lot of
[56:52] hurts in in this in this family of God
[56:55] and people have been hurt. And I want to
[56:58] thank God for some of you all who just
[57:00] recently God brought you through a lot
[57:02] of trauma and sorrow that you've gone
[57:04] through and and you've uh got your got
[57:08] your uh directions right now and got
[57:12] your eyes set upon the cross and upon
[57:14] the Lord Jesus Christ. So you know it's
[57:17] never too late to start. Amen. Long as
[57:19] we're in this earth. The last one hasn't
[57:21] come in yet and the door's not closed.
[57:23] Amen. So we want to thank God for that.
[57:25] Aren't you grateful? Amen. So, let's
[57:28] open in um uh the scripture I want to
[57:31] read here and I'm going to tell you why
[57:32] I'm preaching this today.
[57:35] I did want to say to you singers, my
[57:37] goodness. Uh if if you do have a
[57:39] traveling ministry, uh come out west. Uh
[57:43] didn't brother Bannam hear a voice
[57:44] similar to that one time, go out west.
[57:48] And I'm saying come out west. So uh but
[57:51] you know if you don't well we can we can
[57:54] travel like a almost like a thought by
[57:57] on the internet. So if you you stream
[57:59] your services here brother Thomas. So
[58:02] we're going to we're going to plug in
[58:04] hear those again. Those were beautiful.
[58:06] Really good singing. Amen. Well, I'm
[58:09] waiting for my antique tablet here to
[58:14] come up here.
[58:17] And um I want to read Revelations
[58:20] chapter 8 verse one. And you know uh I
[58:22] preach the message. I preach the message
[58:24] of the hour. And know brother Thomas
[58:25] preaches the message of the hour. I'm
[58:27] not ashamed of it. I believe this is
[58:30] God's program today.
[58:33] And uh so you know I'm going to read
[58:36] Revelations 8:1 because I mean what
[58:38] better scripture uh is the message of
[58:41] the hour. Uh and I want you to see it
[58:44] here. So let's look at it in Revelation
[58:47] chapter 8
[58:48] uh verse one.
[58:52] You know like people will say well what
[58:54] is the message? Well you know what is
[58:56] brother Bram's message it's you could
[58:58] say Hebrews 138. You could say so many
[59:00] things. You know, it' be late in the
[59:02] evening time. And by the way, didn't you
[59:04] all used to have a a church sign up on
[59:06] the a highway out there?
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, it got blown away. Well, good thing
[59:12] I did. Glad the the denominations didn't
[59:15] chop it down or something.
[59:21] You know, you got to be careful. You
[59:23] know, it could it could have been some
[59:24] other message church, too. It could have
[59:26] chopped it down. Tell me,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it it it's sickening
[59:30] whether it's out there or whether it's
[59:32] in here. Amen. That denominational
[59:34] spirit, brother. God has a bride and
[59:36] there's not one going to be missing. And
[59:38] there's not one extra going to be there.
[59:41] Amen. And we can't put him in. We can't
[59:43] take them out. And we might as well
[59:45] start loving each other. Amen. Cuz there
[59:48] might be people that differ from us.
[59:50] Amen. But God loves us anyway. God loved
[59:54] you when you were real different.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; You differed with him a whole lot.
[59:57] Aren't you glad?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a big hand for that.
[1:00:02] Now it's time to preach. But we got to
[1:00:05] read the scripture. Revelations chapter
[1:00:07] 8 and verse one.
[1:00:11] And when he had opened the seventh seal,
[1:00:14] there was silence in heaven about the
[1:00:17] space of a half hour. Let's bow our
[1:00:19] heads. Heavenly Father, humbly bow
[1:00:22] before you. We want to thank you for
[1:00:23] your love, your mercy, your grace, your
[1:00:25] kindness to us. And we know that God is
[1:00:29] always hidden and revealed in
[1:00:30] simplicity.
[1:00:32] And oh Lord, how we have complicated
[1:00:35] this verse of scripture. And I just ask
[1:00:38] that you help us to come a little more
[1:00:40] simple today and help us to understand
[1:00:43] this is the whole plan of redemption
[1:00:45] being fulfilled in our a hour. And I'm
[1:00:49] just asking you, Lord God, that you
[1:00:50] would speak to every heart and touch
[1:00:53] someone today who really needs it deep
[1:00:55] down inside going through some hard dark
[1:00:58] times and uh help them Lord and we
[1:01:02] commit everyone to you, Father, for the
[1:01:05] and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:06] we pray. Amen. You may take your seat.
[1:01:10] God bless you. Good to be part of you,
[1:01:13] one of you. on this is my home church
[1:01:15] today and uh since I've been here really
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; and I respect your pastor and I told him
[1:01:21] today I'm sitting in the house you know
[1:01:23] and he he sends me a text you can come
[1:01:25] over to the house and have coffee with
[1:01:27] us and uh cuz because my my new house
[1:01:31] brother Caleb's new house thank you
[1:01:33] brother Caleb
[1:01:35] uh thank you uh also brother Micah for
[1:01:37] that and sister uh Grace for that supper
[1:01:40] the other night and uh so I'm going have
[1:01:43] to preach short because they changed my
[1:01:45] flight. I got to be out of here like
[1:01:46] 2:00. So, uh, you know, I was kind of I
[1:01:50] wasn't planning to preach until 2:00.
[1:01:54] You You get that?
[1:01:56] Do you believe that? So, you never plan
[1:01:59] it, but but if you all get to pulling,
[1:02:01] you never know what's going to happen,
[1:02:02] right?
[1:02:05] Uh, it's good to have the to know that
[1:02:08] the Holy Spirit's here. We can we can
[1:02:10] sense him, you know, with that deep
[1:02:12] awesome sense from the heart. But
[1:02:14] sometimes you can just literally feel
[1:02:16] him in you. And so we it feels good.
[1:02:20] We're going to feel good one day all the
[1:02:22] time. Huh, brother John?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; All the time in that presence is the
[1:02:27] fullness of joy. Amen. So, uh, we
[1:02:32] appreciate the goodness of the Lord for
[1:02:33] that. So, we uh won't hold you too long,
[1:02:38] but I want to get right to this thought.
[1:02:39] It's uh I'll I'll tell you what the I'll
[1:02:42] tell you what my my uh title is and then
[1:02:46] I'll tell you how this came to me. I
[1:02:49] like this because every time I say it
[1:02:52] that something happens to me. It It's
[1:02:55] owned by God and loving it. That's my
[1:02:59] title.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Now, you never heard me preach this
[1:03:01] before because I never preached it here
[1:03:03] before.
[1:03:05] Uh but if you did hear me preach it
[1:03:06] before, then you must have your
[1:03:09] theophony must have been over there
[1:03:10] listening at me. Uh but I preached it
[1:03:14] only twice and I just this every time I
[1:03:16] get into this, something good happens to
[1:03:19] me. So I uh well something's good has
[1:03:23] already happened even before this
[1:03:24] morning over here this time. But I won't
[1:03:27] tell you those stories. Those are some
[1:03:29] hunting stories. But I wasn't even
[1:03:32] hunting on one of them. It was just
[1:03:34] standing there. And there and that my
[1:03:36] meat my meat buck, which doesn't have no
[1:03:39] antlers,
[1:03:41] stepped out there and said, "I want to
[1:03:43] go home with you there." So I got her
[1:03:46] waiting to go in my suitcase right now.
[1:03:49] That isn't honey. But I feel like I done
[1:03:53] a little something anyway, you know. But
[1:03:56] that's a gift, friends. That's a gift.
[1:03:58] Everything that we have is a gift from
[1:04:00] God to us.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; We didn't deserve any of it. It's all
[1:04:03] grace. Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; But owned by God and loving it. So here
[1:04:08] I was one day I was over in Africa few
[1:04:11] couple years ago. And I was so sick and
[1:04:15] I had to preach about five meetings and
[1:04:17] I've come to the end of a couple weeks
[1:04:19] and I had some more sermons to preach
[1:04:22] and you know preachers get sick and they
[1:04:24] just don't want to go to church
[1:04:26] sometimes. And I uh well, no, I didn't
[1:04:29] get any amens for any of y'all, but see,
[1:04:32] I haven't got quite like you yet. So, uh
[1:04:37] but uh we're just human being, you know.
[1:04:39] Brother Brandham even had those times.
[1:04:41] You know, Elijah, all the prophets had
[1:04:42] those times where they just didn't want
[1:04:44] to get up and go, you know. So, somebody
[1:04:48] came and they knocked at my door at the
[1:04:50] little hotel I was staying in and said,
[1:04:52] "Brother Ted, Brother Ted, Brother Ted,
[1:04:54] Brother Ted." And I slowly got up and I
[1:04:56] went to the door and he says, "Uh, how
[1:04:58] you doing today?" And I was going to
[1:05:01] say, "You know, what would you say?" Uh,
[1:05:04] very well, but
[1:05:06] uh this and this and this or whatever
[1:05:10] else was taking me over at the time. uh
[1:05:13] feeling sorry for myself, feeling like I
[1:05:16] was homesick, you know, burning up with
[1:05:17] homesickness and wanted to go home and
[1:05:20] um uh in a strange land and just the
[1:05:23] different feelings you get. But
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; but sometimes, you know, you speak your
[1:05:29] own deliverance out of your own mouth.
[1:05:31] And he said, "How you how you doing,
[1:05:33] brother Ted?" He was expecting something
[1:05:35] great. I says, "I AM OWNED BY GOD AND
[1:05:39] I'M LOVING IT.
[1:05:43] And he he jumped back. He said, "I am
[1:05:47] too." And there in the hallway, I go I
[1:05:50] went out the door and in the hallway we
[1:05:52] were dancing AROUND SAYING, "WE OWNED BY
[1:05:54] GOD AND LOVING IT." And up up and down
[1:05:57] the corridor, the hotel doors were open
[1:05:59] and people were poking out like this.
[1:06:02] What?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And I immediately whatever was going on
[1:06:08] in my body was gone. And I was I was
[1:06:11] back I was I was back on top
[1:06:15] and uh so
[1:06:20] I want to talk about that, you know,
[1:06:21] being owned by God and loving it,
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; you know, and it it it it goes against a
[1:06:27] lot of people's mentality because they
[1:06:29] don't want to be owned by anything or
[1:06:30] anybody.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Uh but you married people know that that
[1:06:34] changes, right?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Uh you own each other.
[1:06:40] Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you make those vows,
[1:06:44] you know, for better or worse, good
[1:06:47] times, bad times,
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; sickness and in health, you own it.
[1:06:51] Amen. So, we get a little we get a
[1:06:53] little more you when you get married and
[1:06:55] have children, the same thing. It it it
[1:06:57] be it becomes that you learn a little
[1:06:59] bit little bit more about ownership. And
[1:07:02] then when you get your house, you know,
[1:07:04] and you get things paid for and stuff
[1:07:05] and you own a a car. I don't know
[1:07:08] anybody
[1:07:10] uh around here can afford one of them
[1:07:12] new Chevy trucks, but I guess everybody
[1:07:14] would like to own one. But most people,
[1:07:17] they just don't own it, but the bank
[1:07:18] owns it. So they they're sharing
[1:07:21] ownership.
[1:07:22] And then I watched another brother. He's
[1:07:24] coming driving this nice car. And I
[1:07:27] said, "Brother, did you own that?" He
[1:07:29] said, "Yeah, yeah, I'm leasing it." I
[1:07:32] said, "Well, so it's yours." He said,
[1:07:34] "Yeah, but I can only put so many miles.
[1:07:36] I can only do this and that and that and
[1:07:38] that." Oh, too many restrictions. I
[1:07:40] said, I like that ownership where it's
[1:07:41] just, you know, uh no qualifications,
[1:07:44] you know, other than that, he can he can
[1:07:47] do whatever you want with it. Amen.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; And like people people today, you know,
[1:07:52] they treat their life like they own it.
[1:07:55] But if you own it, you you'd you'd be a
[1:07:57] little bit more mindful of what you do
[1:07:59] with it, wouldn't you?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; You know, it's like people that rent all
[1:08:03] their life. They they trash up the
[1:08:05] place. It doesn't matter cuz somebody
[1:08:06] else owns it. You But if you own it
[1:08:10] yourself, there's a lot of difference,
[1:08:12] right, Brother Joe? You you own your own
[1:08:15] place. This this is a this is a real
[1:08:18] commitment. Amen. To maintenance and
[1:08:22] taking care of it and worrying over it.
[1:08:24] And you know, we could be out of our
[1:08:26] house in five minutes if we if we didn't
[1:08:29] uh pay our taxes. Uh it take a little
[1:08:33] longer than 5 minutes, but I mean the
[1:08:35] works would start pretty soon.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; And after a while, you'd find out the
[1:08:39] new owners are at the door knocking on
[1:08:41] the door cuz it went up for auction.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, there's things that
[1:08:45] go with ownership. There's of course the
[1:08:48] pride of ownership and there's the
[1:08:50] there's the the the good feeling of God
[1:08:52] blessed me with something, but on the
[1:08:54] other hand, there's a great
[1:08:55] responsibility that goes with it. Isn't
[1:08:57] it true? But you know he's talking about
[1:09:00] the message is the message is that we
[1:09:04] belong to God.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; And how dare anyone or anything or any
[1:09:12] feeling OR ANY EMOTION OR ANY LIE OF the
[1:09:16] devil stand between me and my owner. But
[1:09:21] you know uh with people today they don't
[1:09:24] want to be oh no no no we and that's why
[1:09:26] there's you know crowning there we don't
[1:09:29] want no kings around our country so we
[1:09:31] can't have a dictator in the white house
[1:09:34] and what have they what they have the
[1:09:35] last eight four years uh they're being
[1:09:39] told what to do now up in New York City
[1:09:41] they want socialism and I've been in
[1:09:43] communist countries I've been in
[1:09:44] communist Russia Bellarus her brother
[1:09:47] and sister been in in those places where
[1:09:49] they
[1:09:50] Everybody gets equal. EVERYBODY GETS
[1:09:53] what they need. Yeah. But their idea of
[1:09:56] what you need and your idea of what you
[1:09:59] need ain't the same.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; They keep you on a much lower level than
[1:10:03] where they live guaranteed. Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And a lot of times preachers want
[1:10:10] to keep the people down below them. They
[1:10:12] they got the higher revelation. Don't
[1:10:14] you challenge me,
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; brother. I like a preacher that likes to
[1:10:18] be challenged. I like a preacher that
[1:10:20] likes to have people ask him questions.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; I don't want Don't pull me too hard.
[1:10:28] I'll get off my subject.
[1:10:31] I actually got another sermon to preach
[1:10:34] too today. So, I'm probably going to
[1:10:35] work it in because
[1:10:38] uh Sister Donna,
[1:10:40] she inspired me last night. Was it last
[1:10:42] night when we had supper? It was Friday
[1:10:44] night. and uh over there at Micah's and
[1:10:47] uh Sister Grace and and it was good and
[1:10:50] everything. Sister Donna, we hadn't seen
[1:10:52] her, you know, for three years and we
[1:10:54] hadn't seen Brother Thomas. Oh, and by
[1:10:55] the way, brother, you your pastor gave
[1:10:57] me a compliment. I'm trying to remember
[1:10:59] exactly how he said it.
[1:11:03] Was it you look the same as you did
[1:11:05] three years ago?
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Was that what he said exactly?
[1:11:10] And I don't know why my ears were
[1:11:12] hearing
[1:11:14] uh you're not much different than you
[1:11:16] were three years ago,
[1:11:18] but that it's that difference that I'm
[1:11:20] thinking about.
[1:11:24] But you know, when a when a when when an
[1:11:27] older fella tells me that, which is a
[1:11:29] youngster,
[1:11:31] uh I you always tell him, "It's your
[1:11:33] eyes, brother.
[1:11:38] It's your eyes because the reality is we
[1:11:42] do change.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh I told brother David I said
[1:11:48] I I hit my peak and I'm turning back and
[1:11:51] going younger now.
[1:11:54] Hallelujah. Well, you know, one of these
[1:11:56] days that's going to happen like that.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're so we're in the message
[1:12:01] of the hour, which is the coming of the
[1:12:03] Lord. This message is the coming of the
[1:12:06] Lord. So, we're looking for the bodily
[1:12:08] coming. Of course, we know that there's
[1:12:10] a physical body that's sitting upon the
[1:12:13] throne. We're paid the price for us and
[1:12:15] we will see him and we will be able like
[1:12:18] uh Thomas, you know, to put the our hand
[1:12:20] in there and that's why he said, "Lord,
[1:12:23] uh you gave your blood and your life for
[1:12:25] us. Amen. You redeemed us. Amen.
[1:12:30] But when we get to Revelations the 8th
[1:12:33] uh chapter and the opening of the
[1:12:35] seventh seal,
[1:12:37] uh I'm not going to make this
[1:12:39] complicated or deep. Now uh I I could
[1:12:42] and that's been a problem because we
[1:12:45] make it so complicated, but
[1:12:48] the simplicity of it is it's all about
[1:12:53] him
[1:12:55] taking what he owns
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; back to himself.
[1:13:00] And that's redemption. The whole Bible
[1:13:02] is about redemption. It's all everything
[1:13:04] all the types and shadows and everything
[1:13:05] in the Old Testament and everything the
[1:13:07] priest did and everything the Jews did
[1:13:08] and everything that Christ did on
[1:13:11] Calvary and everything that the seven
[1:13:13] church age messengers did and everything
[1:13:15] that our prophet did. Amen. And
[1:13:17] everything the preachers are doing today
[1:13:19] is all about redeeming. Now redemption
[1:13:22] means you can't buy something. You can't
[1:13:24] redeem something that you do not own.
[1:13:26] You cannot redeem something that you do
[1:13:29] not own. You must own it and then you
[1:13:31] can redeem it. Can you say amen?
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; So that's the hard thing to convince
[1:13:36] people that God owns them. Because a lot
[1:13:39] of times people today, ah American
[1:13:41] people now, you don't own me. I can get
[1:13:44] out of here anytime I want. I can do
[1:13:45] anything I want. Amen. They think they
[1:13:48] own you. They think they own the road.
[1:13:50] I've got people Oh my God. By the grace
[1:13:53] of God, we've survived. We are if you're
[1:13:55] alive today, say I'm alive today.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; And you're only alive today because
[1:14:00] somebody thought they owned the road and
[1:14:02] God came on the scene and and kept them
[1:14:04] from knock knocking you right in the
[1:14:07] head with their car and killing you
[1:14:09] because it's just every day. Every day
[1:14:11] coming up from Nashville the other day.
[1:14:13] You know, this is not the same place it
[1:14:16] used to be. People,
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; I'm driving out of Nashville. Lord,
[1:14:20] praise the Lord. I'm I'm uh uh uh I'm
[1:14:23] 12:00 heading or 11:30 or 12:00 heading
[1:14:27] out of Nashville. Said I'm going to be
[1:14:29] up on the farm. I'm going to say hello
[1:14:31] and thing by 1 1:30 like that. and I'm
[1:14:35] going to get down in those woods
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to hunt.
[1:14:41] And uh next thing you know, look up
[1:14:42] ahead and there's a 20 mile uh slow down
[1:14:45] on I24
[1:14:48] un knowing it that people two two people
[1:14:53] three different groups of two vehicles
[1:14:57] six of six vehicles thought they owned
[1:15:00] that spot and the other one thought they
[1:15:03] owned that spot
[1:15:05] and there was a fatality. It was
[1:15:07] horrible. I hope you don't know anybody
[1:15:08] that was in those fatalities, but
[1:15:11] uh I drove over the spot coming up and
[1:15:15] it I don't know. It just makes you
[1:15:17] think, wow, right here today
[1:15:20] some soul
[1:15:23] um
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; went to meet their maker.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And that's a serious thing cuz if they
[1:15:29] weren't ready,
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; they're in trouble.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; The trouble only begins That's right.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Not going to get out of trouble just by
[1:15:40] dying.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; But if we die in Christ, we have to do
[1:15:45] that right now.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Then we are alive. Amen.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; All right. I laid my foundations on that
[1:15:52] and I want to I want to move forward
[1:15:55] here about this ownership. And I'm going
[1:15:57] to read this in souls souls in prison if
[1:16:00] you don't mind. The seventh seal,
[1:16:02] brother Bam said this is in seventh in
[1:16:05] the souls in prison. Um the seventh seal
[1:16:09] brings him back to earth. So you know we
[1:16:12] have a lot of preaching. Well he's all
[1:16:14] he's here kind of there is no physical
[1:16:16] coming. He's here kind of invisible you
[1:16:19] know living in us all the things and we
[1:16:22] preach it too. But you got to you got to
[1:16:24] you got to stop and think that
[1:16:28] being owned by him, he can do something
[1:16:30] different than what we think.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; He's the owner.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; He has the right. He's entitled. I'm not
[1:16:36] entitled to question him. I'm obligated
[1:16:40] to submit to him
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; if he owns me.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Sad, I don't want that
[1:16:45] kind of life. It's too straight. It's
[1:16:49] Yeah. But you know what? He owns you.
[1:16:51] And even if you rebel, he owns that,
[1:16:53] too.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; He owns you while you're rebelling. How
[1:16:55] many ever rebelled on the Lord for Okay,
[1:16:58] let's say God bless you. Let's say let's
[1:17:00] say for a day or two.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Well, okay. Let's say for two weeks,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; you rebelled on God. How about two
[1:17:08] years? Any hands? Oh my God, I'm among
[1:17:11] friends. Thank the Lord. Amen. There's
[1:17:14] hope for me. Amen. You know, when you
[1:17:16] rebel on something, it might be just
[1:17:18] some little thing. It just shows that
[1:17:19] you don't want to be owned, but yet he's
[1:17:22] your owner anyway.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; And he owned us even when we didn't want
[1:17:25] to. He owned our negative influ ideas.
[1:17:28] He he owned our rebellion. Can you say
[1:17:31] amen?
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; He if I get started there, I won't
[1:17:34] finish what I want to say. So, uh, let
[1:17:37] me get the get the preliminaries and
[1:17:38] then we'll Amen. And, uh, we appreciate
[1:17:42] the Lord. So, Brother Bam said here, I'm
[1:17:45] reading the quote now. So he said the
[1:17:47] lamb come and took the book out of the
[1:17:49] right hand of him. Now do we believe
[1:17:51] that happened with brother Bam and the
[1:17:53] opening of the seventh seal happened in
[1:17:56] that in that little room there. And
[1:17:59] brother B said when this end time seal
[1:18:02] opens it'll be a total secret to the
[1:18:04] entire world. So you he's looking for
[1:18:07] something you know but something
[1:18:11] happened. He took ownership of your life
[1:18:16] again. Amen. I believe that.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; So it it was fast forward years from
[1:18:21] 1963 for me it was it was 197
[1:18:25] uh4 when that what happened in 1963 or
[1:18:30] in that ministry? What happened during
[1:18:32] that time with the seventh seal brought
[1:18:34] him down to earth? He he took the book
[1:18:36] and he opened it up. Amen. He he passed
[1:18:38] it on to the prophet. Do you agree with
[1:18:40] me on that? He he took the book and
[1:18:42] opened it and he handed it to his
[1:18:44] seventh angel on the earth. And the
[1:18:46] seventh angel declared unto us.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; You are owned by God and you better be
[1:18:53] loving it.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Don't try to fight it because you you're
[1:18:59] owned by God. You you just you you just
[1:19:02] get deeper and deeper into it, don't
[1:19:03] you?
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Some of you are shaking. I know you've
[1:19:06] been there. I've been there, too. And
[1:19:07] we're we're uh we're we're hard-headed
[1:19:11] and sometimes hard-hearted.
[1:19:14] But God owns that, too.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; He knows everything about us. He knows
[1:19:18] my downsitting, mopperizing. He knows,
[1:19:20] you know, when I go to bed, when I get
[1:19:22] up. He knows my habits. He knows
[1:19:23] everything about me. And he owns it all.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to talk about today.
[1:19:27] The owner has come back. And I am owned
[1:19:31] by God. And I am loving every minute of
[1:19:34] it. Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; But you know, you meet people and you
[1:19:36] try to tell them, "Oh, that's too strict
[1:19:37] to life. I wouldn't want go God or
[1:19:39] nobody. Nobody's going to tell me what
[1:19:41] to do." Well,
[1:19:44] somebody is already whether you know it
[1:19:46] or not.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; And it could be it could be the devil.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; It could be the devil. And a lot of
[1:19:53] times people, you know, they're the
[1:19:54] devil lets them get by with stuff and do
[1:19:56] stuff that makes them feel good and this
[1:19:59] and they get them addicted on that one.
[1:20:01] They get addicted on that one. They get
[1:20:03] addicted on that one. The next thing
[1:20:05] THEY'RE PULLING A GUN AND shooting
[1:20:06] themselves. It's because they don't want
[1:20:09] to be owned by anybody. I WANT TO BE
[1:20:11] OWNED BY GOD AND I WANT TO LOVE every
[1:20:14] minute of it while I'm in this earth and
[1:20:17] for eternity.
[1:20:19] I'll never lose my dignity for him. I'll
[1:20:22] never lose my respect for him. I love
[1:20:25] him in every decision he ever made.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; But I haven't always been that way. But
[1:20:32] he owned me when I didn't think this
[1:20:34] way.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; And I still am not fully submissive,
[1:20:41] but I want to be.
[1:20:43] And God looks at our heart.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; So I have a sister, sister. When sister
[1:20:50] Donna said
[1:20:53] it's already done with about her
[1:20:55] healing, I got a sermon on that.
[1:21:00] I won't preach that today, but I'll
[1:21:04] I'll preach it tonight in my dreams.
[1:21:09] It's already done.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; When God said something, it's done right
[1:21:13] there.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; You might not see it happening, but it's
[1:21:16] done already. It's already been done.
[1:21:20] Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] Just like sitting at the breakfast table
[1:21:27] at the last yesterday and brother John
[1:21:29] who's the connoisseur of biscuits.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; He's the one that says when those
[1:21:36] biscuits are done.
[1:21:39] It used to be your mama cuz she'd be up
[1:21:40] and around. Now she's sitting a little
[1:21:43] bit more.
[1:21:44] But uh go check those biscuits. See if
[1:21:46] they're done. And I was thinking they
[1:21:48] better be. I'm starving. That was just
[1:21:51] I didn't go there just to eat. I wanted
[1:21:53] to see you all. The eating was extra
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; perks. But the then it was great. But
[1:22:00] just watching that, I thought, there it
[1:22:03] is.
[1:22:05] When he said they weren't done, they
[1:22:07] weren't done.
[1:22:11] And when he said they were done, I'm
[1:22:12] good with that. Let's go.
[1:22:16] But
[1:22:17] it's it's when he says, not when you
[1:22:20] think.
[1:22:22] It's how he said it,
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; not how you imagine.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm here to tell you, I've done
[1:22:31] a lot of imagination on promises, tried
[1:22:34] to tried to tweak them and make them
[1:22:37] work for me in the way I thought was the
[1:22:40] best way.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; But the owner said no.
[1:22:45] You know, Brother Benham said, if you
[1:22:47] how do you know you really love God,
[1:22:48] right? He said when he you pray and ask
[1:22:52] him for something. I'm just paraphrasing
[1:22:54] but I was finding you the quote.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; But he says when you ask him for
[1:22:57] something and he says no and he says you
[1:22:59] he says his nos are as good as his
[1:23:01] yeses. He said be that shows that you
[1:23:04] really love him in the right way. Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know that if he if he holds
[1:23:09] something back from you, he's got a
[1:23:11] reason for that. He wants to wants to
[1:23:13] get you ready to appreciate what he
[1:23:15] wants to do for you. Can you say amen?
[1:23:17] Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; So you're either being blessed or you're
[1:23:20] being prepared for a blessing. Amen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY. AMEN. You're e
[1:23:25] the healing is already done. Amen. And
[1:23:29] so we thank the Lord for that. So
[1:23:31] rapturing faith was laying in the
[1:23:33] messages. Brother Ben said absolute. He
[1:23:35] said she's laying in the messages. That
[1:23:37] that faith for the rapture is laying in
[1:23:40] the messages. You know, now there's
[1:23:42] there's a little thing moving and I want
[1:23:43] to hit this right off right off the bat
[1:23:45] because I got to get it off my chest.
[1:23:47] that preachers are raising up today the
[1:23:49] five-fold ministries taking the
[1:23:51] prophet's place and they say we don't
[1:23:53] need to uh hear tapes in church and we
[1:23:55] don't need to do that because you can't
[1:23:56] pull on a tape and I've heard them say
[1:23:58] that time and again you can't pull on a
[1:24:00] tape you you can't pull on a tape you
[1:24:02] got to have a live ministry rather I got
[1:24:05] a live ministry of my owner inside of my
[1:24:08] soul what can get better than that my
[1:24:11] owner lives inside OF MY SOUL ALIVE IN
[1:24:14] ME JESUS ISN'T DEAD. He's alive in me.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; I am the bride's revival.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; You are the bride's revival.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; If he if he's alive, even if he owns
[1:24:28] you, he's going to do with you what he
[1:24:31] wants to do.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And and you know, I've got quotes to
[1:24:35] read, but it might take too long.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Read it. Okay, I'll get to it in a
[1:24:40] minute, but we want to we want to read
[1:24:42] continue this quote here in in Souls in
[1:24:45] Prison. The seventh seal brings him back
[1:24:48] to earth. The lamb come and took the
[1:24:51] book. How many knows what's in that
[1:24:53] book?
[1:24:55] You
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; as an attribute of God are in that book.
[1:24:59] That book was God's thoughts put on
[1:25:01] paper and you are God's thoughts. How
[1:25:03] many believe that you are the thoughts
[1:25:05] of God? That's why you have eternal life
[1:25:07] because you didn't have a beginning and
[1:25:09] you can't have an end, but you were once
[1:25:10] a thought in God's mind and now you're
[1:25:12] here in flesh and you're still owned by
[1:25:15] God and he's not going to abandon us.
[1:25:17] Amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; How many have proved that to be true in
[1:25:21] your life?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; How many have a testimony of that?
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; I was thinking what a testimony it is
[1:25:26] and I was reading what brother Brandon
[1:25:28] said. A testimony is God living in you,
[1:25:32] living out his life and not yours. Amen.
[1:25:36] How many got one of those? Amen. Blessed
[1:25:39] be the name of the Lord. But see, if
[1:25:40] you're owned by God, you're happy. You
[1:25:42] You're loving every minute of it. If
[1:25:44] you're really own like people say, "Oh,
[1:25:46] I you know," but what's the problem is a
[1:25:48] lot of people that maybe are a little
[1:25:50] bit more careful about how they live and
[1:25:52] walk and talk and everything because
[1:25:54] they don't want to offend the Lord and
[1:25:55] stuff, but they wear these big deep long
[1:25:57] frowns on their face all the time. I
[1:25:59] mean, a lot of people would like to see
[1:26:01] if you're really loving it. Let me see
[1:26:04] that you're loving it. Amen.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Don't look Don't look so miserable all
[1:26:12] the time.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Chad,
[1:26:19] I don't have any of those days like that
[1:26:20] where I'm looking miserable." Oh, yeah.
[1:26:23] God knows you do.
[1:26:27] And I know you do because I'm one of you
[1:26:29] all.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; And the best of us amongst us has those
[1:26:33] bad days. Brother Random had bad days.
[1:26:35] Do you know that Jesus had more bad days
[1:26:37] than good days? In fact, his whole life
[1:26:40] ministry
[1:26:42] was living for others. And that's
[1:26:43] eternal life. He wasn't trying to get
[1:26:45] something out of it.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; He never he never got a dime for his
[1:26:50] wages. Never had a house. Never place to
[1:26:53] lay his head.
[1:26:56] But he was he was buying you. Can you
[1:26:59] say amen?
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; He come down here to purchase you.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; He was getting that title clear. Amen.
[1:27:04] Because where you had t your title was
[1:27:06] all messed up. Anybody here had title
[1:27:08] fraud
[1:27:09] on anything equipment or a home or
[1:27:13] something farm, man. It's real. It's
[1:27:16] happening all over the place.
[1:27:18] And uh so you got to keep keep kind of
[1:27:20] keep your eyes on that title being
[1:27:22] clear. And that's the whole message, the
[1:27:24] clearing of the abstract title deed to
[1:27:26] the bride of Christ.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; If you're owned by him, what do you own
[1:27:31] him? You own him and everything that he
[1:27:34] is and all that he DID FOR YOU, YOU OWN
[1:27:37] IT.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; It's like a wife and a husband. But that
[1:27:42] wife, she can't boss her husband around,
[1:27:44] but she owns him anyway. She knows how
[1:27:46] to get to him. And there you say,
[1:27:49] "Brother Ted, now are you telling
[1:27:51] secrets on Sister M?" No. No. I'm just
[1:27:52] kind of I you know, I go around kind of
[1:27:54] watching how people get along. And I I'm
[1:27:57] saying
[1:28:00] All right. Yeah. Who's the big boss
[1:28:02] here? You're both owners. You're
[1:28:04] co-owners of each other. Amen. And
[1:28:07] children, we don't own them. God owns
[1:28:10] them.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; God owns the cattle on a thousand hills.
[1:28:12] He's the owner of everything. Can you
[1:28:14] say amen?
[1:28:15] And so I just want to I want to drive
[1:28:17] that home. And then I want to read in
[1:28:19] the breach where brother Bam said
[1:28:20] Ephesians 4:30 and he said, "Grieve not
[1:28:22] the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are
[1:28:24] sealed until the day of your
[1:28:26] redemption."
[1:28:28] Hold that word redemption. Brother
[1:28:30] Bannon said, "See, until the day that
[1:28:32] the book of redemption
[1:28:35] has been revealed." What day is that?
[1:28:38] That's this message. That's this day.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. When that book was open, that
[1:28:42] seventh seal was open. and that
[1:28:43] mysteries of God are opened up to the
[1:28:46] bride and the and the mysteries are not
[1:28:48] deep theology. It's life coming out.
[1:28:51] It's opened up and life comes out. Amen.
[1:28:54] The book opens up and you come out. The
[1:28:57] the message I was telling somebody the
[1:28:59] other day and this brother I never met
[1:29:00] him before in my life. He was from down
[1:29:02] around Dyresburg, Tennessee where
[1:29:03] brother George comes from and this
[1:29:05] brother Texas is his name. and and I was
[1:29:08] talking to him and he said he said,
[1:29:09] 'Boy, since I heard brother Bham preach,
[1:29:11] he said, "It's like the Bible is a whole
[1:29:13] new book to me." That's exactly what
[1:29:15] Brother Bham said, "It's a whole new
[1:29:16] book to me, too." Amen. And he said,
[1:29:18] because he said he's opened up the
[1:29:20] mystery, he said he's he's like he's
[1:29:23] preaching things that I always knew that
[1:29:27] I knew, but I didn't know them. And when
[1:29:30] he puts it into word form, Amen. That's
[1:29:33] why that God the thought had to become a
[1:29:35] word. He had to put himself in a form
[1:29:37] where he could speak to that seed that's
[1:29:40] inside of you. Amen. Because why?
[1:29:43] Because that seed only recognizes word.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; The seed is the word. It's the word
[1:29:48] seed. How many say amen? Inside of you.
[1:29:51] It won't recognize any other headship
[1:29:54] but the word, the pure word of God.
[1:29:57] Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; That's why when somebody's, you know,
[1:29:59] watering it down or changing it, adding
[1:30:02] to, taking away, you catch that.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; You can't eat that. Amen. Amen. Because
[1:30:09] your owner won't let you. Aren't you
[1:30:11] glad?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Your owner knows where you're supposed
[1:30:13] to feed. Aren't you glad? How many
[1:30:14] believe this is your home church and
[1:30:16] this is where God sent you? You the
[1:30:18] owner sent you. It was just wasn't your
[1:30:20] church. Oh, yeah, it was. I like those
[1:30:22] people. I got friends there and
[1:30:23] everything. And I got a girl that I got
[1:30:25] my eyes on over there. Or I got, you
[1:30:29] know, whatever. Found my wife here. I
[1:30:31] know this is my church.
[1:30:34] Amen.
[1:30:37] Or Brother Thomas is just such a fun
[1:30:39] guy. YOU JUST GOT TO LOVE HIM. Just he's
[1:30:41] just funny. He's uh I I guess you are
[1:30:44] sometimes
[1:30:49] happy. He's energetic. So you want to
[1:30:51] feed on him. You can't feed on brother
[1:30:53] Thomas. You can't feed on somebody
[1:30:56] else's revival. I mean you you can but
[1:30:59] brother SAID YOU ARE NOT FEEDING on a
[1:31:01] man.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT FEEDING ON A MAN. And you
[1:31:05] know he was preaching to his own church
[1:31:06] there knowing once the untimely said
[1:31:08] you're not feeding on a man. But they
[1:31:10] were. THEY WERE FEEDING ON THE MAN. THEN
[1:31:13] GOD TOOK THE MAN AWAY. Then they had to
[1:31:14] look into the message. Now, we got to
[1:31:17] see that what we're feeding on is THE
[1:31:20] OPEN UP THE BOOK and the owner had came
[1:31:23] back already to take ownership. Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be free.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; I want to be owned. I want to be told.
[1:31:36] People say, "No, I don't want to be
[1:31:37] told."
[1:31:39] You know, but if that still small voice
[1:31:41] is talking to you, you better listen.
[1:31:43] Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; I want that still small voice. Don't
[1:31:46] you?
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; I want to be told.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And but people today, they they're
[1:31:54] rebellious.
[1:31:56] I'm going to be told by anybody, but
[1:31:57] then you you make yourself some Tik Tok
[1:32:00] hero or some internet influencer and you
[1:32:04] do everything they say.
[1:32:09] It's amazing
[1:32:11] how people could listen like up in New
[1:32:12] York City, how the people could listen
[1:32:14] to communism.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; How could they listen to communism and
[1:32:18] if you just knew your history or if
[1:32:20] you've ever been behind the iron
[1:32:22] curtain, found out how people were
[1:32:23] living. It is not like he's portraying
[1:32:26] it.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S A OWNERSHIP OF THE RICH, the
[1:32:30] powerful. And if you don't like it,
[1:32:32] they'll eliminate you. Brother, I don't
[1:32:35] want to I don't want to live like that.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; I want freedom
[1:32:40] to be owned by God and loving every
[1:32:42] minute of it.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; I have my freedom.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; I'm Every time I say it, I start feeling
[1:32:48] good again. I'm owned by God and I'm
[1:32:51] loving it. No matter what's happening to
[1:32:53] me today, I'm owned by God and I'm
[1:32:55] loving it because the owner came back to
[1:32:57] get me. Can you say amen?
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Are you going to forget the title of
[1:33:02] this sermon?
[1:33:04] I might say it 50 more times just to
[1:33:06] make sure
[1:33:10] if I have enough time.
[1:33:13] So, Brother Bam says here, okay, whereby
[1:33:17] you are sealed until the day of your
[1:33:19] redemption.
[1:33:22] I don't want to make anybody
[1:33:23] embarrassed, but if you have the Holy
[1:33:24] Ghost and you'd like to raise your hand
[1:33:26] and say, "I know I got the Holy Ghost."
[1:33:27] I'd like to see that, too.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Well, there's something about it. It
[1:33:33] just it uh you can't really put it into
[1:33:37] words how you know it, but you just know
[1:33:40] that you know.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:33:44] uh brother Bam said, "Hold that word
[1:33:47] now, redemption."
[1:33:50] And then he explains what that word day
[1:33:52] of redemption is in uh the breach.
[1:33:57] He said, "Until the day that the book of
[1:34:00] redemption has been revealed
[1:34:04] and the redeemer came to claim his
[1:34:07] possession, nothing
[1:34:10] can take that possession
[1:34:13] until that time.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; So nothing could nothing could hold you
[1:34:19] like he can hold you." Because when he
[1:34:21] comes and takes possession, he's the
[1:34:23] owner. After all, the owner's here.
[1:34:25] Everybody has to bow to the owner. Can
[1:34:28] you say amen?
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Now, they might want to brand you as
[1:34:32] insane, but that's okay. I'm owned by
[1:34:33] God. That's what That's what I believe.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Because I think they're insane because
[1:34:38] they don't want to take direction from
[1:34:41] the most lovely person they could ever
[1:34:43] meet.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; The most beautiful, lovely, caring,
[1:34:52] holy, precious
[1:34:56] compassionate
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; owner you ever had.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely.
[1:35:08] So then he says,
[1:35:11] "Don't grieve the Holy Spirit. Don't do
[1:35:14] things or he says say and do things that
[1:35:17] pleases God for the book
[1:35:22] is now sealed and you are sealed with
[1:35:24] the book. So what happened? He opened it
[1:35:27] up declared that the owner is here and
[1:35:29] then seals it back inside of you my
[1:35:32] brother INSIDE OF YOU MY SISTER. HE
[1:35:36] SEALS HIMSELF INSIDE of there. And
[1:35:39] everywhere YOU GO, HE'S THERE GOING
[1:35:41] THERE WITH YOU. WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING
[1:35:44] THROUGH, HE'S GOING THROUGH that with
[1:35:47] you. Not only in Jesus, but Jesus in
[1:35:50] you. He is going through it with you. He
[1:35:53] owns you. He bought you. Whatever
[1:35:56] maintenance is needed, he's responsible.
[1:35:58] Take care of it. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, even if it's not
[1:36:04] exactly to the right place he wants you
[1:36:06] to go, he's in there guiding, steering.
[1:36:10] He'll cut you off here. He'll cut you
[1:36:12] off there. He'll get you where he wants
[1:36:14] you to be. Guaranteed. Because he's
[1:36:17] never going to lose you.
[1:36:31] You might lose the feeling, but he he's
[1:36:33] not going to lose you.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; You might be
[1:36:39] hitting the head so many times with
[1:36:41] stuff going on in your life that you
[1:36:42] can't even think straight. But he's
[1:36:44] still he's still good to communicate
[1:36:46] with you.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; He'll get through with you. Other people
[1:36:49] wouldn't have the time a day for you
[1:36:50] because you're just out way out there
[1:36:53] somewhere. But he cares. Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; And because he owns you. He can't get
[1:36:58] rid of you. You're his.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Now, see, it's hard for us to comprehend
[1:37:04] because there's a lot of stuff we've
[1:37:05] owned in our life that we wish we didn't
[1:37:07] ever own and we wanted to get rid of it.
[1:37:09] But you're owned by God and he's loving
[1:37:11] every minute of it.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; And you're owned by God and you're
[1:37:14] loving every minute of it.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And there we get to the very theme of
[1:37:18] Brother Bam's message. Love. Redeeming
[1:37:21] love. The love OF GOD. GREATER FAR than
[1:37:23] tongue or pan could ever tell. Some of
[1:37:27] these beautiful singers who could sing
[1:37:28] it every Sunday morning for 40 more
[1:37:30] years, you could never begin TO SAY. HOW
[1:37:33] DEEP IS that love of God? It's all a
[1:37:35] love story.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; And so the believer, we understand when
[1:37:38] you when you love the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:41] and you believe his Bible, his word, the
[1:37:44] message is a love letter to you, you can
[1:37:46] look through the lines and you can see
[1:37:48] that love coming through there. Amen.
[1:37:51] You can see that what he really means in
[1:37:53] there. Can you say amen?
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; And that's why I think ministers
[1:37:57] sometime are trying to get delve into
[1:37:59] those realms between the lines and they
[1:38:01] forget we got to preach exactly what the
[1:38:03] line said because he didn't make a
[1:38:06] mistake. He said it just the way it's
[1:38:07] supposed to be said.
[1:38:10] So I really I really rejoiced at that
[1:38:13] thought that the brother text said from
[1:38:15] Dyresburg. He said, he said, uh, yeah.
[1:38:17] He said, when I hear brother Brandham,
[1:38:19] he said SOMETHING IN MY SOUL JUMPS OUT.
[1:38:21] HE SAID, I've known the Bible all my
[1:38:23] life as a Baptist something like that.
[1:38:27] Nothing against them. I got great
[1:38:28] friends that are, you know, all
[1:38:30] different denominations. But, you know,
[1:38:32] once something happens to where THE
[1:38:34] REDEMPTION STORY IS SETTLED for you.
[1:38:37] Amen. WHERE THE REDEEMER HIMSELF COMES.
[1:38:40] And you know what the word redemption
[1:38:42] means? It's a Hebrew word goel, which is
[1:38:44] a goel is a is it is a is a is a slave
[1:38:48] buyer who comes and you're up for sale
[1:38:51] to every kind of buyer. Whoever has that
[1:38:54] highest dollar going to buy you and take
[1:38:56] you over. And you know, Lucifer's got a
[1:38:59] lot of money, got a lot of power,
[1:39:01] religious knowledge, theology, and and
[1:39:04] persu beauty and all these promises that
[1:39:07] he makes and and so forth. and he's out
[1:39:10] there buying up some slaves. Amen. But
[1:39:13] you're that one that can't be bought.
[1:39:16] Amen. You're that one that's not for
[1:39:19] sale.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; You know the story about the African
[1:39:22] slave. He said, "I this guy came came to
[1:39:26] buy some slaves and they were having to
[1:39:28] whip them to get out there and STAND
[1:39:30] THERE. STAND STRAIGHT AND TALL. Show how
[1:39:32] strong you are. I want to get high
[1:39:33] dollar." And they're whipping them and
[1:39:36] whipping them. There was another one
[1:39:37] just standing there straight and tall
[1:39:38] without a whip. You know the story.
[1:39:43] And the and the buyer was looking
[1:39:44] around. He said, "I want to buy that
[1:39:46] one. That's my first one I want to buy
[1:39:48] right there."
[1:39:52] And this owner, he all the rest of them,
[1:39:54] he didn't he he didn't care whether he
[1:39:55] owned them or not. He just wanted
[1:39:57] something out of them.
[1:39:59] But this one, he wasn't going to sell.
[1:40:03] And he says, "Uh,
[1:40:08] that brings up a little funny thing in
[1:40:10] my family. I was, you know, I was stuff
[1:40:12] I don't get too attached to stuff." Now,
[1:40:16] I guess I have enough Kuckian in me that
[1:40:18] I do to some stuff. But, uh, my wife
[1:40:22] said, "You sold that?" I said, "Yeah, I
[1:40:25] just owned it for a while. I didn't need
[1:40:27] anymore. I just sold it. Did you get
[1:40:28] what you paid for? You can make an ink?"
[1:40:30] No.
[1:40:32] I was selling things so fast one time
[1:40:35] and I'm into that again right now. You
[1:40:37] know, it's this getting old thing, you
[1:40:40] and she said, "You you you going to sell
[1:40:42] everything? You going to sell me?" Nope.
[1:40:46] You ain't for sale cuz you're my life,
[1:40:48] honey.
[1:40:50] How could I sell my life out?
[1:40:53] And Christ is our life.
[1:40:56] and he has appeared in this hour
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; and we're appearing with him
[1:41:02] as being owned by God.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; But let's show people that we love it.
[1:41:09] It's not a boredom.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; This is this is the greatest thrill of
[1:41:13] my life. The greatest joy I could ever
[1:41:14] have is serving the Lord.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Even it's hard life. You're not going to
[1:41:19] be loved. I mean, they're not, you know,
[1:41:21] they're not rounding us up and throw us
[1:41:22] into jail yet. But devil's after us
[1:41:26] night and day. But I'll just stand up
[1:41:29] and say
[1:41:31] if he says, "Won't you want to come with
[1:41:32] me a while?" I say, "I am owned by God."
[1:41:36] What was I going to say then?
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; And loving it. You're preaching my
[1:41:41] sermon now, folks. You know, we're
[1:41:44] supposed to A lot of people say, "Oh,
[1:41:45] you're preaching trying TO BE LIKE
[1:41:46] BROTHER BEN." EXACTLY. THE LIFE THAT WAS
[1:41:49] IN HIM WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE BELIEVER.
[1:41:53] THE SAME JESUS THAT WASN'T BROTHER
[1:41:54] BRANDON. WE'RE NOT FEEDING ON A MAN.
[1:41:57] WE'RE FEEDING ON THE BODY WORD OF THE
[1:41:59] SON OF MAN. JESUS CHRIST ALIVE TODAY.
[1:42:03] Who is by the way our owner,
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; our original owner. He owned us from the
[1:42:08] beginning.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; He He owns us for eternity. There'll
[1:42:12] never be a a slave market for us again.
[1:42:15] Amen. because we're free.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; To be owned,
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; we're free
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; to be led by him. Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; And loving every minute of it.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; And I know I know we all have
[1:42:29] testimonies of something we would have
[1:42:31] done if he had led us.
[1:42:35] But now we we didn't and we lived a
[1:42:37] little longer and we look back and say,
[1:42:40] "Man, if I would have done that,
[1:42:43] you remember brother Brandon told the
[1:42:44] story about he was going to go to Canada
[1:42:46] because he couldn't handle all the
[1:42:47] friction in the church, all the in
[1:42:50] insanity around the tabernacle, all the
[1:42:52] all the antichrist spirits that raised
[1:42:55] up right under Brandon." You say, "Oh,
[1:42:56] brother B." Some people say, "Oh,
[1:42:58] Brother Brand, I Brother Joseph would
[1:43:00] just take over the whole thing." That
[1:43:01] would, Brother, you got to have the
[1:43:03] inddwelling owner inside of you or
[1:43:06] you're going to wander. I don't care
[1:43:08] what church you go to or what pastor you
[1:43:11] have.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; We didn't fall in love with our
[1:43:14] preachers. We fell We didn't fall in
[1:43:16] love with Brother Brandon. Rebecca
[1:43:18] didn't fall in love with Eleazar. She
[1:43:21] was waiting for her Isaac friend. The
[1:43:23] Isaac alone. Amen. The Christ alone is
[1:43:28] my true owner. He's the one that died on
[1:43:30] that cross for me to buy me back, to
[1:43:31] redeem me. He's the one that opened that
[1:43:33] seventh seal in this hour. AND IT'S NOT
[1:43:35] ALL revealed where we can explain it.
[1:43:38] But it's in our heart saying we're owned
[1:43:41] by God and everything's going to WORK
[1:43:43] OUT.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALREADY DONE. IT'S ALREADY
[1:43:46] FINISHED. AMEN. How many love the Lord?
[1:43:50] You say, "Brother, can we apply that to
[1:43:52] your to the length of your sermon?"
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; You don't have to say it. Somebody
[1:43:58] thought that right there. I'm not
[1:43:59] reading your mind,
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; but I have trained you to expect me to
[1:44:03] preach long, and I'm not going to do it
[1:44:05] today,
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; but I'm just hoping that you've grown to
[1:44:09] understand that long doesn't mean what
[1:44:12] you used to think it was.
[1:44:14] So
[1:44:16] on the other hand, I said I I'm not
[1:44:18] going to make it complicated because
[1:44:20] that's what ministers do with this
[1:44:21] seventh seal. They get so deep.
[1:44:27] Do you get it?
[1:44:29] They're all nodding. You better not
[1:44:31] drink.
[1:44:35] But if you don't have it revealed to you
[1:44:38] to where you can tell somebody else what
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. in a simple way.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; You're not you're not going to be a soul
[1:44:47] winner
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; because you got to reach out to them
[1:44:50] with where they live stuff.
[1:44:53] So I like the concept of
[1:44:56] everybody's rebelling against ownership
[1:44:58] or being told but rather every country
[1:45:00] I've been in I've been in a lot of
[1:45:01] countries all over the world 80ome
[1:45:04] countries spent time there lived with
[1:45:06] the people and stuff
[1:45:09] they all fight the same battle. It's
[1:45:12] either the police or it's the governor
[1:45:15] or it's this president or it's something
[1:45:18] else or the mayor or somebody's telling
[1:45:21] them what to do and they don't like it.
[1:45:24] But when they own you
[1:45:27] and that's the thing about it. See, the
[1:45:30] world can own our body or think they do,
[1:45:34] but they can't own our soul.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; They don't own your free moral agency.
[1:45:40] Amen. You have the right to choose. Do
[1:45:43] you believe that?
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Now, you might have to give your life.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Have you thought about that?
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; You think it could be possible that
[1:45:51] we're at that insane age where people
[1:45:52] are so insane they'd rather shoot you
[1:45:54] than have you living right as a
[1:45:56] neighbor?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; I think we're living in that time, don't
[1:45:59] you?
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; And that's a persecution for the happy
[1:46:03] people. I think it's jealousy. They're
[1:46:06] jealous of why are we so happy?
[1:46:09] What would you answer if they ask you
[1:46:11] why are you so happy?
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. Or I would say, I'm
[1:46:16] owned by God and loving it. That's what
[1:46:18] I would say. Every time I say that, I
[1:46:20] feel happier. I'm still sick, but I feel
[1:46:23] better.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; I'm still getting old, but I'm owned by
[1:46:26] God and I'm loving it. This is great.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be a Christian, an oldtime
[1:46:32] Christian, than anything I know. Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:46:42] Finishing this quote, brother Benham
[1:46:43] says,
[1:46:46] "The book is sealed now and you are
[1:46:50] sealed." So, Brother Bon's ministry was
[1:46:52] to reveal us in the book and show us
[1:46:56] that we're sealed with the book. Nothing
[1:46:58] can tamper with you because it's in his
[1:47:01] hand now.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; You are back in the hand of God. How
[1:47:05] many believe that? Brother Brandham
[1:47:07] said, "He saved me when I was nothing."
[1:47:08] He said, "I'm still nothing, but I'm in
[1:47:10] his hand now." Brother Brandham said
[1:47:13] that. I love that. I'M STILL NOTHING,
[1:47:16] BUT I'm in his hand, and I'm loving it.
[1:47:18] Amen. And then, Brother Brandham says,
[1:47:21] "The Holy Spirit itself is the seal."
[1:47:24] And a he said, paragraph 70
[1:47:28] of the breach, a seal signifies a
[1:47:31] finished work.
[1:47:34] Yeah.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; If you die right now, where would you
[1:47:36] go?
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; You got to go to heaven. You got to go
[1:47:40] to glory. Why? Because you're you're
[1:47:43] owned by God. God God isn't going to
[1:47:46] send any of his children away. God's
[1:47:48] going to watch over you. How many How
[1:47:49] many believe that?
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; We could start a testimony meeting. We'd
[1:47:53] be here for three hours and I'd miss my
[1:47:55] plane and my wife would cry.
[1:47:58] So, we're not going to do that.
[1:48:00] But we could.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. of all the times
[1:48:05] that he proved to us that to be owned is
[1:48:07] the best life.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; That's where you're really free because
[1:48:12] he's not going to he's not going to tell
[1:48:15] you something that's going to hurt you.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whereas you can't trust all those
[1:48:20] other voices, right?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; The seal signifies a finished work. So
[1:48:24] lot that's a big question. Do I have the
[1:48:26] Holy Ghost? Well, are you owned by God
[1:48:29] and loving it? It' be a good question to
[1:48:30] ask, you know, a measuring stick
[1:48:34] or you just wish it wasn't so strict.
[1:48:38] Wish
[1:48:40] it wasn't so deep where you could
[1:48:41] understand it more.
[1:48:46] I I think that's been our thing as
[1:48:48] ministers. It this is so deep that we
[1:48:51] try to make it so complicated.
[1:48:56] When brother Bon said God's always
[1:48:58] hidden and revealed in simplicity
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; and so a seal signifies a finished work
[1:49:03] and when the seventh seal is broken
[1:49:08] the mystery of God that's sealed in
[1:49:10] these mysterious seals is finished
[1:49:14] until that day that that seal is broken.
[1:49:17] Then it's revealed what's on the inside
[1:49:19] of it.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; What is on the inside of it?
[1:49:24] was been revealed
[1:49:26] and now it's on the inside of you. The
[1:49:28] life of God, eternal life is sealed
[1:49:32] inside of you. How many can say amen to
[1:49:34] that?
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; And then he said, listen, I love this
[1:49:38] part. You're going to love it, too.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; And if you if if you don't say anything
[1:49:42] about it, that's okay. I know you love
[1:49:43] it anyway.
[1:49:45] The seal
[1:49:47] signifies ownership.
[1:49:50] The seal has a mark on it. It shows a
[1:49:54] ownership when you are bought by the
[1:49:56] blood of Jesus Christ. Anybody say amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; And he said SEALED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:50:01] ANYBODY ELSE SAY AMEN.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; You no longer BELONG TO THE WORLD or
[1:50:08] anything pertaining to the world. You
[1:50:12] are owned by God.
[1:50:15] Hallelujah.
[1:50:18] Praise the name of the Lord. That's thus
[1:50:20] sayeth the Lord from the mouth of a
[1:50:21] prophet that I'm owned by God. I'm going
[1:50:24] to add to that and I'm loving every
[1:50:26] minute of it.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; And another thing is a seal is a
[1:50:30] security. It means you are secure.
[1:50:33] It means you don't now you don't don't
[1:50:35] believe in eternal security. I don't
[1:50:37] know but brother but a seal signifies
[1:50:41] security to the destination. And woe be
[1:50:45] unto the guy THAT WOULD TRY. I'm going
[1:50:48] to get back in my place here. Woe be ah
[1:50:53] I lost my place. Wo okay here. Woe be
[1:50:58] unto the guy
[1:51:00] that WOULD THAT WOULD TRY TO BREAK that
[1:51:04] seal.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; There's not GOING TO BE NO TITLE
[1:51:09] TAMPERING ON this one.
[1:51:11] the the the the original owner COME BACK
[1:51:13] AND CLEARED OFF THE TITLE AND EVERYBODY
[1:51:17] THAT HAD A MARK ON ME, MY SINFUL NATURAL
[1:51:20] BIRTH, my sinful life, excuse me, my own
[1:51:25] stupidity, my own wrong choices, every
[1:51:29] devil
[1:51:31] that had an influence on me has lost a
[1:51:34] hold on me.
[1:51:44] Amen. And brother B said, "Cuz when
[1:51:47] you're sealed in,
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; he's sealed out."
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Why'd you come tempting? He wants to
[1:51:56] look in that. He can't figure this thing
[1:51:58] out
[1:52:00] cuz he knew the old you,
[1:52:04] but he doesn't know this new you. I'm a
[1:52:07] brand new man. I'm a new creation. I'm a
[1:52:09] brand new man.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; And the devil can't figure that out
[1:52:12] because he doesn't know what CREATION
[1:52:14] IS. HE'S NOT A CREATOR. He's a
[1:52:16] perverter. AMEN. BUT GOD'S THE CREATOR.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And when God created himself,
[1:52:23] you were part of him.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; You are the be Jesus was the beginning
[1:52:28] of the creation of God. And brother man
[1:52:31] said, "We the church, we are the
[1:52:33] continuation
[1:52:35] of the creation of God." What is that?
[1:52:37] God creating himself a part of his own
[1:52:41] creation. Amen. I'm a part of his
[1:52:44] creation. AND GOD CREATED IT AND he owns
[1:52:47] it. Amen. Therefore,
[1:52:50] he owns my life.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; And he and he and he owns my free will
[1:52:57] too
[1:52:58] in this sense.
[1:53:01] He won't override my free will if I
[1:53:04] decide to go rogue. And by the way, I'm
[1:53:07] I don't I don't like these types, but I
[1:53:10] was down there picking up my rental car.
[1:53:13] There was a choice between a Chevy and
[1:53:15] now I'm coming up to Kentucky, you know,
[1:53:17] Chevy,
[1:53:18] mini SUV like thing. And I said, I don't
[1:53:23] have that good experience with
[1:53:24] Chevrolet.
[1:53:26] But
[1:53:28] but
[1:53:30] um there was a Nissan and I looked at
[1:53:33] Oh, that's a neat looking cart and it's
[1:53:34] a Rogue. I saw God have mercy.
[1:53:38] Preacher driving a Rogue. Does anybody
[1:53:41] have a Rogue? I guess it's not it's not
[1:53:43] bad. It's not bad anymore, but a rogue
[1:53:45] used to be just couldn't you couldn't
[1:53:46] train them. They couldn't learn nothing.
[1:53:48] They wouldn't obey, you know.
[1:53:51] Go go go go go back to Britain in the
[1:53:53] old English. A rogue is about the worst
[1:53:55] thing you could call somebody.
[1:53:58] You hardheaded
[1:54:00] numb skull or whatever we would say
[1:54:02] today. Rogue, you just can't. Come on.
[1:54:05] You won't take correction. You won't
[1:54:06] take
[1:54:08] Seems like we got some of those around
[1:54:10] the churches today, you know. Oh, I'm in
[1:54:12] the message. BUT THEY WON'T TAKE ADVICE.
[1:54:14] you know, it's not only like the
[1:54:16] preacher's going to beat you over the
[1:54:18] head, you know, if you don't do it, but
[1:54:20] he's he's he's just so uh concerned that
[1:54:23] you take his advice that he gets a
[1:54:25] little harsh on on you sometime. But
[1:54:27] that, you know, that's the love of God.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it was the love of God
[1:54:33] when God had to take his daughter and
[1:54:35] his wife away.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; He said he didn't understand it. Most of
[1:54:41] his life, a good part of his life, he
[1:54:42] didn't understand. Did he say that,
[1:54:43] brother Joe? He said, "I didn't
[1:54:44] understand it." He said, "Because God
[1:54:47] promised in his Bible said he would make
[1:54:49] all things work together for the good."
[1:54:50] And he said, "I just I thinking on that
[1:54:52] and I said, Lord, I wonder how many
[1:54:54] times brother Brandham said, Lord," in
[1:54:57] his private chambers, I just can't
[1:54:59] understand how that right there could be
[1:55:03] working together for my good.
[1:55:06] But then he said after a while I looked
[1:55:08] back at it and he said
[1:55:11] he said my life is like the rose like
[1:55:13] Jesus himself.
[1:55:17] God wanted to get the sweet perfume out
[1:55:19] of my life. So he had to crush the rose.
[1:55:22] So he took my little Sharon Rose and he
[1:55:25] took my my hope and and he said because
[1:55:29] you know here's how he said it and
[1:55:33] we got to be careful when we say that we
[1:55:34] we don't say it with some kind of
[1:55:36] disrespect towards brother Brandham
[1:55:38] because we respect him with deepest of
[1:55:41] respect because he was a kinsman for us.
[1:55:44] He was our kinsman. He went through
[1:55:46] everything like we go through.
[1:55:50] And he said, she said, he had to crush
[1:55:52] me. He said, to get the perfume out of
[1:55:55] my life, he said, because there was too
[1:55:58] much Brandham in me.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; And then he added, there's too much of
[1:56:06] you in you.
[1:56:09] So you know when you talk about
[1:56:10] ownership that somebody else is
[1:56:12] responsible
[1:56:15] I would love to get to the place that
[1:56:17] everything I Jesus did always only those
[1:56:19] things that please the father. He said I
[1:56:22] but that come with a price of ownership.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; He was owned by the word
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; even even as natural uh human man he
[1:56:31] wanted to get out of the crucifixion.
[1:56:33] That's right.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; He knew what was coming just a few hours
[1:56:36] down.
[1:56:37] And even in his prayer, I mean, look,
[1:56:41] we are we are so privileged that we can
[1:56:44] break into this private prayer
[1:56:47] closet of our Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Uh most of us, we wouldn't want anybody
[1:56:53] knowing what we're praying and how we're
[1:56:54] praying in there.
[1:56:57] You know, how we're pouring our hearts
[1:56:58] out to God. But we we can see right into
[1:57:01] God's own heart right there in Jesus
[1:57:03] right there in the garden. And there he
[1:57:05] said, "Father,
[1:57:07] my hour has come."
[1:57:10] But said, "If it's possible,
[1:57:15] let this cup pass from me.
[1:57:22] Nevertheless,
[1:57:26] I'm owned by God.
[1:57:30] And I'm loving it.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Loving it doesn't mean it feels good.
[1:57:34] Loving it doesn't mean it's really great
[1:57:36] like you're going to want to, you know,
[1:57:38] you're going to win everybody by, you
[1:57:40] know, how much you suffered isn't going
[1:57:42] to win anybody. But it's just your
[1:57:44] personal conviction that there's nothing
[1:57:47] better than being owned by God because
[1:57:50] because he's the only one who knows how
[1:57:51] to make the end come out good for us.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; He knows how to watch over. He will
[1:57:56] never forget you. He will never leave
[1:57:59] you. He'll never forsake you. He's alert
[1:58:02] and watchful over his word. I had the
[1:58:06] scriptures, but the time is running. Is
[1:58:08] that clock accurate? Okay, I'm closing
[1:58:12] now. I got to close her down. Anyway,
[1:58:15] you'll get part two, three, four, and
[1:58:17] five next time.
[1:58:21] When you're sealed in, you're owned by
[1:58:23] God. And brother P, there's a lot of
[1:58:26] borderline believers. They just don't go
[1:58:27] that far.
[1:58:30] Oh, so I thought the borderline
[1:58:31] believers were in them denominations.
[1:58:33] Well, if you're not owned by God, you're
[1:58:35] a denomination.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Because you're telling God what to do
[1:58:38] instead God telling what you what to do.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; See, Brother Ted, don't be so bossy. I
[1:58:43] just got to say the truth.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; But I say it in love. But I say it also
[1:58:48] realizing that if you don't accept it
[1:58:49] today, there will come a time because
[1:58:51] you are a seed of God. You will submit
[1:58:54] to God's leadership in your life.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; It's like there's young men in here got
[1:58:59] a call on their life to preach. You're
[1:59:00] going to submit to I may not right now
[1:59:02] today. I've seen it on a lot of
[1:59:04] brothers. I tell them they're always,
[1:59:05] "Oh, no, no, no, no, brother. Don't do
[1:59:08] that. Don't do that." Next thing I know,
[1:59:09] they're out preaching somewhere. I said,
[1:59:11] "You see something there and you just
[1:59:13] try to help it along, but you can't help
[1:59:15] somebody along. It's the Holy Spirit
[1:59:17] alone. It's between you and since he
[1:59:19] owns you, he don't permit NO ONE ELSE TO
[1:59:21] TOUCH YOU. NO PREACHER, NO NO
[1:59:24] ANTICHRIST, NO DEVIL, NO SICKNESS, NO
[1:59:28] SIN, NO NOTHING HAS A RIGHT TO put their
[1:59:31] finger on you. Can you say amen?
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well,
[1:59:39] the devil put that on me and he never
[1:59:41] got pay for it." He didn't pay for it
[1:59:43] yet. He's going to pay and it's all
[1:59:46] storing up and it's going to be double.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; It's all storing up. Amen. Like my dad
[1:59:51] said when I I was naughty and he come
[1:59:56] home and he said, "How was Teddy today?"
[1:59:57] And Teddy, all the kids were good, Joe,
[2:00:00] but Teddy.
[2:00:03] And uh he said, "Where's he at?" So he
[2:00:07] taking his belt off and he hit him. He
[2:00:09] said, "What?" All right. I guess they
[2:00:10] use it for razor st. He used it on me.
[2:00:14] And u Teddy, where he at? Dad wants to
[2:00:19] see you. Amen.
[2:00:22] And I'd go under my favorite hiding
[2:00:24] place where he never found me. He said,
[2:00:26] "Teddy, I know you're in there. And if
[2:00:29] you come out now, I'll go easy on you.
[2:00:34] But if you stay in there for a half hour
[2:00:36] or more, you're going to get it double.
[2:00:40] You know, the old devil thinks he's
[2:00:41] getting away with it, friends. He He
[2:00:43] does some mean business
[2:00:46] against us, trying to discourage us,
[2:00:48] trying to say, "Yeah, it's God just
[2:00:51] bossing you around." Because that's his
[2:00:53] attitude. That's what he come to Eve
[2:00:54] with. He said, "Has the Lord said you
[2:00:57] you you can be happy except you can't do
[2:00:59] that." Well, wouldn't that make you
[2:01:01] happy if you could just do ANYTHING YOU
[2:01:03] WANTED? THINK about it. You know,
[2:01:05] BECAUSE THE DEVIL HIMSELF GOT A HE GOT A
[2:01:07] PROBLEM WITH WITH BEING OWNED BECAUSE
[2:01:09] WHY? HE DON'T HE DON'T HAVE AN OWNER.
[2:01:12] AMEN. But you have an owner. How many
[2:01:14] believe you have an owner?
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; An owner. Stuff I own. You know, I want
[2:01:20] to take care of if you own too much that
[2:01:24] you can't take care of it.
[2:01:26] That's why they changed the Old
[2:01:28] Testament polygamy in the just just one
[2:01:32] because you get all these, you can't
[2:01:34] take care of them all.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; You're going to spend money on people to
[2:01:38] take care of them and stuff, but they
[2:01:39] need more than your money.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; That's why men, we make the big problem
[2:01:44] getting so busy making money, thinking
[2:01:46] that's what they want, and they just
[2:01:48] want you just sit here by me. Yeah, but
[2:01:51] I'm making you. I'm going to get you
[2:01:52] that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:01:54] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She says, "Just
[2:01:55] please." But she, you know, she don't
[2:01:58] want to hurt your feelings. So don't say
[2:02:00] nothing. But you got to be perceptive.
[2:02:01] You got to have discernment. How many
[2:02:03] believe that?
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; How many have stayed married 10 years,
[2:02:05] 15 years, 20 years,
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; 5 years,
[2:02:11] three years? You got to be perceptive
[2:02:14] of what is entailed with owning someone.
[2:02:19] You don't boss them around. You gently
[2:02:22] lead them.
[2:02:25] Some of our sisters aren't so gentle.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:32] Some are too gentle. You got to find the
[2:02:35] right balance
[2:02:37] cuz you own each other. You got to speak
[2:02:39] up sometime.
[2:02:42] And man, if you won't let your wife talk
[2:02:43] to you on that subject, you better pray
[2:02:48] through
[2:02:49] because the Holy Spirit's going to tell
[2:02:51] you,
[2:02:53] "Didn't I give you a help fit for you?"
[2:02:58] Well, what in the world are you doing
[2:03:00] not letting her help you?
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Then I can say, "I'm owned by
[2:03:07] God and I'm loving it. It all got
[2:03:08] better."
[2:03:09] You can make things better by
[2:03:13] understanding that you're owned. It's
[2:03:15] not this church don't own you. Brother
[2:03:17] Thomas, do you own these people?
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Do I own you?
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; In a way, I do because we're all part of
[2:03:24] the economy of God. We see it in that
[2:03:25] way as brothers and sisters.
[2:03:28] But you are you are you are owned by
[2:03:30] God.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; God tells you something different when
[2:03:33] he's telling me. You're still my
[2:03:35] brother. You're still my sister.
[2:03:37] And that's the way people have got so
[2:03:39] denominational around this message
[2:03:42] that it's really sickening, I think.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; And I got on that about ministers
[2:03:49] thinking that the five-fold ministry
[2:03:51] being the final voice.
[2:03:53] Now, Brother Brham didn't say that, but
[2:03:56] he said she, the bride,
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; is the final voice. So now they're
[2:04:03] saying the the five-fold ministry in the
[2:04:06] last days is the final voice and you
[2:04:09] can't pull from a tape.
[2:04:11] Remember I said that a while ago.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; I wanted to say this because
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; well that's funny. Uh we pulled from the
[2:04:22] Bible all of our life.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; It's no it's no living person. It's just
[2:04:26] a book.
[2:04:28] But we have the revelation it is a
[2:04:30] living person
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; because that message on the tape is
[2:04:34] alive. And another thing I tell the
[2:04:36] ministers is this.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; They can't pull from a tape. What about
[2:04:40] you, preacher?
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Where'd you get those quotes?
[2:04:49] Oh, you say, "Oh, we're becoming
[2:04:52] rebellious. We can't be like that. We
[2:04:53] got to show respect." Friends, the best
[2:04:55] respect you can show is if it's your
[2:04:58] opportunity to help somebody get
[2:04:59] straight, help them.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; But do it with love. Don't don't don't
[2:05:03] talk behind their back. Go to them. This
[2:05:06] is where we should be man enough, woman
[2:05:08] enough now to not gossip on pe preachers
[2:05:10] or people or churches, but we should go
[2:05:13] to them directly and say something in my
[2:05:16] heart just doesn't go along with that,
[2:05:18] brother. So I called the brother. He
[2:05:20] preached in my church. You'll never know
[2:05:22] who it was. And they said, "The old
[2:05:24] sacrifice can't purify you to go in a
[2:05:27] rapture."
[2:05:29] And he was referring to the tapes.
[2:05:33] And so you got to have it fresh from the
[2:05:35] mouth of preachers.
[2:05:37] Brother, I'll tell you, every false cult
[2:05:40] that ever started started exactly that
[2:05:42] same way. The the not the nickel spirit
[2:05:46] came in there and they set themselves up
[2:05:48] like kings. And then they feel like,
[2:05:50] "Well, now that you're in my church, if
[2:05:52] you got a revelation, you can never
[2:05:54] leave this church until I say you can."
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; When you get that kind of stuff coming
[2:05:58] across, IT SHOWS they're not owned by
[2:06:01] God yet.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Cuz if they're owned by God, they're big
[2:06:03] enough to let you go. They're big enough
[2:06:05] to say, "LORD, MAKE THEM HAPPY." AMEN.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "When you love a
[2:06:10] woman, really love a woman, and you you
[2:06:12] dreamed that you married and you were
[2:06:14] happy ever after and everything, and
[2:06:16] then she comes to you and says, "Well,
[2:06:21] I really love so and so more than I love
[2:06:24] you." And brother Mann said, "If you
[2:06:26] really love her, right, Christ revealed
[2:06:27] in his own word, you can read it for
[2:06:28] yourself." And he said, "You really love
[2:06:30] her right, you'll say, honey, because I
[2:06:33] do love you and I'm not permitted to
[2:06:36] love you as a husband. that kind of
[2:06:37] love. But I love you as a sister.
[2:06:41] I want you to be happy. You go marry
[2:06:42] that man.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he said.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; God loves us enough that he's going to
[2:06:55] put us with the people he wants us to be
[2:06:56] with. He's going to guide us. He's going
[2:06:58] to take care of us.
[2:07:00] And and we're owned by God. So, I'm I'm
[2:07:03] even off my notes, but you know, he owns
[2:07:05] my
[2:07:06] my ideas. He owns my thoughts,
[2:07:09] my figuring out, my analytical. I'm not
[2:07:12] too analytical, but I do it enough.
[2:07:14] Analyze things. And he owns that. My
[2:07:17] processing, my processor. He owns my
[2:07:20] processor. My brain,
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; my thinking, my feelings, my emotions,
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; and something y'all probably don't have
[2:07:28] over here, my moods.
[2:07:32] He owns my moods
[2:07:34] and he loves it
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; because he can work with that.
[2:07:41] If he can just make me see
[2:07:44] something, he can change my mood. How
[2:07:46] many believe that God can change your
[2:07:47] mood?
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; He can change your day. He can change
[2:07:50] your problem. He can change your
[2:07:52] situation. Amen. You said, "Whoa, whoa,
[2:07:55] whoa. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're way on
[2:07:57] down the ROAD THERE SOMEWHERE." NO, SIR.
[2:07:59] HE CAN DO IT RIGHT NOW. GOD OWNS you
[2:08:02] right now.
[2:08:04] This a good way to close a sermon.
[2:08:07] Bring it down to right now. Right now.
[2:08:09] That disease you have, you God owns that
[2:08:12] disease, THAT SICKNESS, THAT HANGUP YOU
[2:08:14] GOT, GOD owns that right now. He bought
[2:08:17] you in all of your problems, ALL YOUR
[2:08:20] BREAKDOWNS, ALL YOUR SITUATIONS.
[2:08:23] HE BOUGHT YOU. He owns you. And he's
[2:08:25] never going to sell you. Amen. Can you
[2:08:28] say amen?
[2:08:29] You're owned by God
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; and that'll drive the people of the
[2:08:37] world crazy.
[2:08:40] Said, "How can you be happy being owned
[2:08:43] when you're not free?" I said, "Because
[2:08:45] this is my free choice.
[2:08:49] I made the free choice to say yes to him
[2:08:53] and I meant it." And that's a big
[2:08:55] problem with our young people because
[2:08:58] they'll say yes and then they'll go back
[2:08:59] on it and they'll say yes and they'll go
[2:09:01] back on it. When you cut ties with Satan
[2:09:05] and the world,
[2:09:07] you got to cut them clean.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; You got to cut it clean, friends.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Clean cut decision for God. That's why
[2:09:14] I'd rather instead of
[2:09:16] working up a service and trying to get
[2:09:18] them down at the altar, Brother Ben
[2:09:20] said, "Let the Holy Spirit deal with
[2:09:22] them right there.
[2:09:24] Let them let them go all a while. Give
[2:09:26] them some groom to do what they have to
[2:09:28] do.
[2:09:31] God can speak to them anywhere.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Many of us were a prodigal son oursel.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Thought we just, you know, take the
[2:09:39] goodies,
[2:09:41] take the money and run
[2:09:44] and got down there,
[2:09:46] nearly died.
[2:09:49] And Amazing Grace, he was still there
[2:09:51] calling say, "Why don't you go home?
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Why don't you go home?
[2:09:56] Did you hear those dinner bells?
[2:10:00] Did you hear that mama's voice? You
[2:10:02] know, the
[2:10:04] sound of
[2:10:06] papa,
[2:10:08] the owner." That's what this message is
[2:10:10] to me.
[2:10:12] It's not it's not God sent a prophet or
[2:10:14] brother Ben was a great prophet and we
[2:10:16] need to start admiring him more and and
[2:10:20] then we got to carry that on down to his
[2:10:22] son and we got to carry that same
[2:10:24] admiration on down to the ministers.
[2:10:26] It's not about that.
[2:10:29] There's no big eyes's and little U's
[2:10:31] here, brother.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Ministers are actually
[2:10:37] servants of God.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. to serve you.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; The owner says, "Go and help them." And
[2:10:44] you go,
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; "Yes."
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm loving I'm owned by God and I'm
[2:10:50] loving every minute of it.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; It's been the greatest privilege of my
[2:10:53] life to be here with you today, one of
[2:10:56] them, and to be able to share with you
[2:10:58] that
[2:11:00] that uh
[2:11:03] quit fighting that, you know, it's just
[2:11:05] got to be that way.
[2:11:08] You were owned by God
[2:11:11] and uh
[2:11:13] no use in running anymore.
[2:11:16] We got to get to that place to walk off
[2:11:17] the earth like Enoch. I'm going to tell
[2:11:19] you, it's going to take more
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; than just knowledge of the quotes.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; You know what Enoch's testimony was? Why
[2:11:28] he went in the rapture?
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; He had this testimony before he went in
[2:11:32] his rapture, right?
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; What was his testimony? He pleased God.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Three words. He pleased God.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; I know. We can learn all the deep things
[2:11:43] and we can we can, you know, get all
[2:11:46] puffed up like, "Wow, I've got more
[2:11:47] revelation." I've been in the message
[2:11:48] longer. Remember the old days? Some of
[2:11:51] you remember the old days when the
[2:11:52] message first came around. Some people
[2:11:53] that were with brother Brad.
[2:11:57] Were you with brother Brad? Yeah, I was
[2:11:58] with brother Brad. And how long you been
[2:12:02] in the message was another big question.
[2:12:04] How long you been in the message?
[2:12:07] When I first got saved, I was so fired
[2:12:09] up. And people say, "Woo!" And I was
[2:12:12] into those tapes and books for two or
[2:12:14] three years. They said, "How long you
[2:12:15] been in the message?" I said, "Oh, I've
[2:12:16] been in the message for three months and
[2:12:18] seven days." And uh and uh 14 hours, so
[2:12:23] many many minutes. I've really been in
[2:12:25] this message a long time. Then after I
[2:12:28] was in the message message 45 years, I
[2:12:31] finally dawned on me that was the wrong
[2:12:34] answer. And so they say, "How long you
[2:12:36] been in the message, brother Ted?" Like,
[2:12:38] "How long?" Oh, tell me how how much you
[2:12:40] know how long you been in the me. Sorry
[2:12:42] to disappoint you. I just now coming in.
[2:12:46] I'm just now coming in. Or should I say
[2:12:48] it's dropping from here to here right
[2:12:50] now. It been I've been carrying it
[2:12:52] around up here in my in my in my ego.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; You know, we're either an eagle or an
[2:12:58] ego. Yeah. Lots of eagle eagles. Egos
[2:13:01] around. But there should be more eagles.
[2:13:04] Amen.
[2:13:06] Yeah. Carrying around my ego. Like,
[2:13:08] well, I know this and that. And I I'll
[2:13:11] be honest with you. I know a lot of
[2:13:12] people that were close to brother and
[2:13:13] brother Green and I just dozens of
[2:13:15] brothers became my dearest lovely like
[2:13:17] fathers in the gospel to me. And I God
[2:13:19] privileged me with that. And I used to
[2:13:22] kind of spout that around, you know,
[2:13:24] like, yeah. Yeah. Now I realize it means
[2:13:28] nothing. The whole purpose of God is
[2:13:31] have I
[2:13:33] recognized that my owner has come and
[2:13:35] took a hold of me
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; and let him seal me in with him. Amen.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; It's all boils down to the token.
[2:13:43] greatest highlight min message of his
[2:13:45] entire ministry
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; that opening of that seventh seal
[2:13:49] released the token
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; which is perfect love to come on your
[2:13:54] life and you ain't going to wander no
[2:13:56] more
[2:13:58] because you're owned
[2:14:00] the owner got a leash on you. Aren't you
[2:14:02] glad?
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; I I go walk down the street sometime
[2:14:08] around our place and we got people
[2:14:09] walking around with their doggies on a
[2:14:11] leash. Well, I had a bunch I had a bunch
[2:14:12] of dogs that didn't it wasn't on a leash
[2:14:14] and I lost them all.
[2:14:19] Coyotes got one. Somebody else I think
[2:14:22] my I had a real good-looking dog and it
[2:14:24] just got jumped in somebody's car, I
[2:14:27] guess, out on the highway. And I said,
[2:14:30] you know, I thought I owned those dogs,
[2:14:32] but they didn't. They weren't loving it,
[2:14:34] I guess. So, they took off.
[2:14:38] So I said, "Well, it's leash time."
[2:14:42] And then you see people today walking
[2:14:43] their in these neighborhoods around
[2:14:45] here. They're building all these little
[2:14:46] communities and they're walking their
[2:14:47] dog on a leash and leash. What is that
[2:14:50] dog just as happy as a lark? He's owned,
[2:14:52] but he's loving every minute of it cuz
[2:14:55] he's safe. He's secure. Amen. He knows
[2:14:58] he got a warm place to lay down at night
[2:15:00] and he got food waiting for him and
[2:15:02] water and everything you could ever
[2:15:04] really want. Amen.
[2:15:08] He's happy. Amen. Blessed be the name of
[2:15:11] the Lord. Let's bow our heads. I've had
[2:15:13] a good time. Thanks for pulling and
[2:15:16] helping me preach. Now, may the Lord
[2:15:18] bless you with our heads bowed. Somebody
[2:15:21] that not quite enjoying your freedom so
[2:15:24] much and you'd like to be a little more
[2:15:27] owned by God. You'd like to know that
[2:15:30] the owner is near all the time. I'd like
[2:15:33] to know that. Wouldn't you?
[2:15:35] I wouldn't want just anybody come
[2:15:37] working on me. I would like to know that
[2:15:40] the owner is doing it because he cares
[2:15:43] for me. Nobody else cares for me like
[2:15:45] the owner. Cuz he owns me after all. He
[2:15:48] bought me. I'm his.
[2:15:51] He can't get rid of me.
[2:15:53] He can't lose me.
[2:15:55] He can't not love me. But he has to be
[2:15:58] hard sometimes. But it's his love. And
[2:16:01] and I'm loving it too because in the end
[2:16:04] I've lived long enough to know that you
[2:16:05] come through things and then you look
[2:16:07] back and say, "Praise God, that's the
[2:16:10] best thing that could ever could have
[2:16:11] happened. Lord, you never make
[2:16:13] mistakes." Anybody here at that point
[2:16:16] right now kind of just
[2:16:19] wondering just
[2:16:21] should I should I you should you should
[2:16:24] just give in to that ownership because
[2:16:27] somebody else will get you if you don't
[2:16:30] get that seal.
[2:16:32] Somebody else will get you. And I guess
[2:16:35] you know I just have to be a good
[2:16:37] faithful minister and tell you it's not
[2:16:39] going to be fun
[2:16:42] when the when the enemy gets you. It's
[2:16:44] not going to be fun. You're not going to
[2:16:46] be happy.
[2:16:48] But if you're owned by God
[2:16:50] and loving it, you're going to be happy.
[2:16:53] Maybe there'll be a hand that raise.
[2:16:55] Say, "Brother Ted, something you said
[2:16:56] got me got next to me. And I want you to
[2:16:58] pray for me. Would there be a hand? God
[2:17:00] bless you." And somebody else, "God
[2:17:01] bless you." And we bless you, sister and
[2:17:03] brother. And God bless you, sister. And
[2:17:04] sister here. God bless you, brother. God
[2:17:06] bless you. God bless you in the back,
[2:17:08] brother. On the God bless you, sister
[2:17:09] right there. God be with you. Amen. and
[2:17:13] brother in the back there. God bless
[2:17:14] you. Young another sister raised her
[2:17:16] hand here. So let's pray. Heavenly
[2:17:18] Father
[2:17:21] something when I say that it's a
[2:17:23] testimony that I give that breaks me out
[2:17:26] of my
[2:17:28] my feelings, my mood or my being down or
[2:17:32] sad or I don't know why, but it just
[2:17:34] when I say it, it that's it shocks me.
[2:17:38] It shocks me back to reality that I'm
[2:17:41] glad I'm owned. I'm happy
[2:17:45] that I have a a caring a caring heavenly
[2:17:48] father that owns me. And you put your
[2:17:52] seal and your mark on my life. And I'm
[2:17:54] glad to be representing you, Lord, by
[2:17:57] that seal because it shows coming and
[2:17:59] going. And and there was hear some that
[2:18:04] even now with all the great preaching
[2:18:05] and all the great services that they've
[2:18:07] they've all had in this church that even
[2:18:09] now they this thought has kind of
[2:18:12] awakened something on the inside of
[2:18:14] their heart deep down on the inside. And
[2:18:17] it's only the voice of the owner that
[2:18:20] can do that.
[2:18:22] No other voice can make them do that
[2:18:25] Lord.
[2:18:27] And so since you've spoken to them,
[2:18:28] maybe you use something I said, but it
[2:18:30] wasn't me. It was you inspiring me.
[2:18:34] Then Lord, I'm giving them over into
[2:18:36] your hands. And I'm asking you, Lord, to
[2:18:39] show them what what benefits are in
[2:18:42] store for them. What blessings are in
[2:18:45] store for them if they would just be
[2:18:47] happy being owned by God?
[2:18:51] Because that's cold hard facts is that's
[2:18:54] the way it is. But there's a warmth to
[2:18:57] it. There's a a depth of love that's
[2:19:00] there that they could find nowhere else.
[2:19:02] There's a comfort
[2:19:04] that they could never find anywhere
[2:19:06] else. Believe we believe Lord that we
[2:19:10] don't want them to try it anymore. Let
[2:19:13] them quit trying to find it some other
[2:19:16] way
[2:19:18] and bring them to your way, Lord, today.
[2:19:22] and we could all find strength in some
[2:19:25] similar testimony as mine was. I'm owned
[2:19:29] by God and loving and it it just does
[2:19:31] something to me. It shocks me to realize
[2:19:34] I got no complaints.
[2:19:36] God is good all the time. And I just ask
[2:19:40] you to bless them today, each one of
[2:19:42] them, and go home with them. I could
[2:19:45] can't go there with them to talk or
[2:19:46] fellowship. I'd love to, but you be
[2:19:48] there and watch over them, Lord. Lord,
[2:19:51] we commit them to you. But everybody
[2:19:53] else that's sick, Lord, let it be
[2:19:55] something that was started today that's
[2:19:57] going to be finished
[2:20:00] by and by
[2:20:02] because you're the owner and you know
[2:20:05] exactly when to come on the scene. So we
[2:20:08] commit them to you, Lord. Bless this
[2:20:10] church, Brother Thomas, and all the
[2:20:12] lovely saints here. Father,
[2:20:15] thank you for giving me the privilege of
[2:20:16] being back in my beloved home ground
[2:20:19] here in Kentucky. just three years we
[2:20:20] lived here, but I've never been the same
[2:20:24] all my life
[2:20:26] since those three years here around
[2:20:28] these people. And I love them so much.
[2:20:31] And I'm glad there's an open door for
[2:20:33] us. And I pray you'd show them that
[2:20:35] they're welcome to come our way also
[2:20:37] anytime.
[2:20:40] And we we pray for them and we ask them
[2:20:42] to pray for us. And we commit them to
[2:20:44] you, Lord, now in Jesus name for the
[2:20:46] glory of God.
[2:20:48] Everybody said
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; amen. I love him. I love him. As your
[2:20:53] pastor comes, as you want to stand or
[2:20:55] something, as you're going to close, I
[2:20:59] love him.
[2:21:03] I
[2:21:06] love him. and bless your brothers and
[2:21:08] fishes because
[2:21:12] he first

[2:21:38] And Jesus
[2:21:40] is the sweetest
[2:21:44] name
[2:21:45] I know.
[2:21:50] And he's just the same.
[2:21:57] Press his holy
[2:22:00] name.
[2:22:03] Oh, that's the reason
[2:22:07] why I love
[2:22:10] him so.
[2:22:15] Oh, Jesus is
[2:22:19] the sweetest
[2:22:21] name I know.
[2:22:26] Amen. You love him with all your heart
[2:22:28] this morning. Amen. How many enjoyed the
[2:22:31] message this morning?
[2:22:33] Amen. Owned by God and loving it. Could
[2:22:36] you put up that song? Never, never,
[2:22:38] never have I ever, ever, ever been so
[2:22:40] happy, happy, happy. Amen. I thought
[2:22:44] about this course as he was preaching
[2:22:47] and I don't have the words in front of
[2:22:48] me. So, and I give them to you. There we
[2:22:52] go. Well, never never
[2:22:56] have I ever ever ever been happy happy
[2:23:02] in my world.
[2:23:05] Oh, never never
[2:23:08] have I ever ever
[2:23:12] been so happy happy happy.
[2:23:17] barely wrapped his arms around.
[2:23:26] Heaven could afford.
[2:23:30] Oh, never never
[2:23:34] have I ever ever
[2:23:37] been so happy.
[2:23:41] Once again this morning. Oh, and never
[2:23:44] never never have I ever ever
[2:23:49] been so happy happy happy in my Lord.
[2:23:56] Oh, never never
[2:23:59] have I ever ever
[2:24:02] been so happy in my life before.
[2:24:08] Oh, he wrapped his arms around me
[2:24:15] and heaven
[2:24:17] could afford.
[2:24:21] Oh, never never
[2:24:24] have I ever ever
[2:24:27] been so happy
[2:24:30] in my Lord.
[2:24:33] Amen.
[2:24:34] Amen. Amen. Sorry about that. They had
[2:24:38] technical difficulties and I have memory
[2:24:41] loss difficulties. Amen. And you know, I
[2:24:45] I was I want to finish up. We're going
[2:24:48] to stop with this, but a song I know
[2:24:51] sister Becky and brother Steve and a lot
[2:24:53] of older ones remember this song. And
[2:24:56] how many's ever heard that song? It took
[2:24:57] a miracle before. Do you remember that,
[2:24:59] Sister Becky? And I love the the ver the
[2:25:02] chorus. It says
[2:25:05] uh
[2:25:07] it says it took a miracle to put the
[2:25:10] stars in place.
[2:25:12] It took a miracle to hang the world in
[2:25:16] space.
[2:25:18] But when he saved my soul,
[2:25:22] he cleansed and he made me whole.
[2:25:26] It took a miracle of love and grace.
[2:25:30] Aren't you thankful for that this
[2:25:31] morning? Amen. We're not going to sing
[2:25:34] it because I'm way rusty on that.
[2:25:36] Brother Ted said he was rusty on
[2:25:38] preaching. Well, I'm rusty really bad on
[2:25:41] this song. But God bless you. Remember
[2:25:42] the service Wednesday night 7:00. Come
[2:25:46] expecting from the Lord. And let's sing
[2:25:48] this little song.
[2:25:50] Wonderful, wonderful Jesus is to me. As
[2:25:52] we go this morning, has it been
[2:25:54] wonderful to you this morning? Well,
[2:25:56] wonderful. God bless you. Wonderful
[2:26:00] Jesus is to me. He's my counselor,
[2:26:04] prince of peace. Mighty God is he. For
[2:26:08] he is saving me, keeping me
