[42:04] we have a testimony amen that somebody
[42:07] wants to give
[42:08] amen about what the lord's done for him
[42:10] so
[42:11] uh we know a couple weeks ago brother uh
[42:14] danny wade got baptized y'all remember
[42:16] amen and the lord did something for him
[42:19] and so he said he
[42:20] has a testimony i said well images come
[42:23] and share it this morning a minute
[42:24] before we get into the message and so
[42:28] better danny come on up if you will and
[42:29] give us a testimony but god's done
[42:31] always good to hear amen i'll tell you
[42:33] what
[42:35] it's a real blessing to see our young
[42:37] folks get baptized with the holy ghost
[42:39] amen so praise the lord brother danny
[42:42] wait
[42:44] he amen i told him guys yes the little
[42:47] work that he does too enough
[42:49] i guess a following with his testimony
[42:51] and everything and so
[42:52] i asked him to share a little bit of
[42:53] that too but hey god bless you buddy
[43:10] you know uh i got baptized um
[43:14] as uh you all remember um
[43:18] well uh i got baptized before like
[43:21] um the first uh baptism which
[43:25] it was i can say that i
[43:28] definitely didn't feel the holy ghost
[43:30] that time i was not dead with the holy
[43:32] ghost that time
[43:33] um yeah i'm really nervous right now
[43:37] but yeah um
[43:42] so so uh well i think
[43:46] i got baptized for the wrong reason like
[43:49] in that moment i was kind of like um
[43:52] i didn't really know what i was doing
[43:54] completely so
[43:56] so um for like a really long time i was
[43:59] like
[44:00] um i had it on my heart that i just
[44:03] felt like i should get baptized again i
[44:06] just knew
[44:07] that i was missing something and i knew
[44:10] i
[44:10] hadn't actually um got the holy ghost
[44:15] and so i just felt like that for like a
[44:18] really long time
[44:20] and and after a while i was like
[44:24] i was like i got to get baptized again
[44:26] sometime
[44:28] i was i i just had to because
[44:32] the kids um and at that point and
[44:35] i with my life i have been changing i've
[44:38] been growing closer to the lord
[44:40] so i decided to
[44:43] get baptized again and i was going to
[44:49] repent and be baptized in the name of
[44:52] jesus christ
[44:54] uh like the bible says in acts 2 38
[44:57] so so um yeah
[45:01] so anyways um
[45:04] i knew i had to do the right thing and i
[45:07] got baptized so
[45:08] uh when i got in the water i
[45:12] i just believed with all my heart that i
[45:14] would receive the gift of the holy ghost
[45:16] because the bible says
[45:18] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[45:19] ghost if you repent and get baptized in
[45:22] the name of jesus christ
[45:24] so when i was in the water i knew that
[45:27] when i was going to come out the water i
[45:28] was going to get
[45:29] the gift of the holy ghost so
[45:33] when i went under the water and i came
[45:35] out i just felt a
[45:36] rush of of joy
[45:40] and peace it was so amazing it was the
[45:42] most amazing feeling i had ever felt
[45:44] and my hands went up without me even
[45:48] um thinking i i didn't raise my hands up
[45:52] because i decided
[45:53] you know i'll just raise my hands no my
[45:55] hands went up without me thinking at all
[45:57] all i could
[45:58] think about is that is how amazing it
[46:01] was to
[46:02] to feel the holy ghost i was just so
[46:05] glad and so joyful to receive the gift
[46:07] of the holy ghost
[46:08] it was so amazing and i i didn't want to
[46:11] leave that moment at all so i was just
[46:15] standing there with my hands up
[46:17] for a really long time it was
[46:20] the most amazing feeling i'd ever felt
[46:25] so i posted it on tick tock it has like
[46:30] over um 600 000
[46:34] uh views on it now
[46:37] and yeah i've been like trying to preach
[46:40] the gospel and tick-tock
[46:42] so i got 6 000 followers on there now
[46:47] and and i i was thinking like on my tech
[46:52] talk channel
[46:52] i hadn't i was thinking i wasn't
[46:56] doing enough uh and and i don't think i
[47:00] was
[47:00] uh uh chan didn't making a difference
[47:04] well someone told me that that uh i had
[47:07] been
[47:07] in uh helping them to get closer to god
[47:10] and help them to
[47:12] to um to uh you know
[47:15] um and now they feel closer to god than
[47:19] they ever was
[47:20] and it's because of my channel and and i
[47:22] think that was so amazing
[47:24] so i have no idea what god has in store
[47:27] for me
[47:28] but um but i just
[47:32] i just feel like he has something
[47:35] huge for me i have no idea what it is
[47:37] i'm i don't know if i'm meant to be a
[47:39] pastor or not
[47:40] but i'm just trying to focus on on
[47:43] following him and doing what he wants
[47:45] me to do and what his will is for me
[47:50] so um uh thank you for
[47:54] um letting me uh get up here and
[47:58] yeah i'm really nervous
[48:01] i don't even know how to end this
[48:07] god bless you thanks a lot
[48:14] amen how many enjoyed that that was a
[48:16] good testimony amen we'll just be
[48:18] praying see what the lord will have for

[48:38] when someone
[48:39] amen reaches out in faith amen and god
[48:43] honors that faith
[48:44] you know because if you have genuine
[48:45] faith the bible says that
[48:48] god is obligated and we'll give you the
[48:49] baptism of the holy ghost amen
[48:51] he'll accept that sacrifice give you the
[48:54] baptism of the holy ghost change you

[49:02] when the holy ghost comes
[49:04] it is unspeakable
[49:07] uh joy and full of glory amen it's just
[49:11] no describing
[49:12] the peace amen and nothing ever and
[49:14] nothing else will ever take the place of
[49:16] that amen
[49:18] amen nothing's as good as what receiving
[49:21] the baptism of the holy ghost is
[49:23] amen receiving the new birth and serving
[49:25] the lord
[49:26] i was 20 years old amen when i i believe
[49:29] it's about 20
[49:30] years old somewhere near when i received
[49:32] the baptism of the holy ghost and i
[49:34] certainly
[49:35] amen i'm thankful for that it changed my
[49:37] life
[49:38] amen and if it's a genuine new birth it
[49:40] holds amen
[49:42] so we're thankful for that god bless you

[51:16] your throne of grace lord again father
[51:18] on this beautiful winter day
[51:20] fall day perhaps lord in the beautiful
[51:23] days that you've given us lord and we do
[51:24] thank you for the opportunity and
[51:27] the freedom lord jesus to be able to
[51:29] worship you yet in spirit any truth
[51:31] father and
[51:32] lord we just ask god that you'll come in
[51:34] a special way speak to your people along
[51:36] the way lord and
[51:37] father say the things that you want to
[51:39] be said but especially bring your
[51:41] anointing both upon the speaker
[51:43] and on the ears of the hearers lord
[51:45] jesus come and make your presence known
[51:47] this morning father
[51:48] and lord we just thank you father for
[51:50] being with us even in us and to the end
[51:52] of the world
[51:53] lord just bless the meditation of our
[51:55] heart now we ask god that you just take
[51:56] this little thought that i feel you've
[51:58] laid out my heart to speak on
[52:00] and lord and say what you once said this
[52:02] morning father
[52:03] thank you for all your blessings lord
[52:05] jesus and for all the miracles that you
[52:06] do in our lives daily lord
[52:08] so many of them that we don't recognize
[52:10] we ask these blessings in your precious
[52:12] name in the name of the lord jesus
[52:14] christ
[52:15] amen and amen turn your bibles this
[52:18] morning and
[52:19] this morning i want to take and uh take
[52:22] another thought and i've been kind of
[52:23] praying for the lord to perhaps given me
[52:25] a winter series i
[52:27] haven't preached on a series for a very
[52:30] long time
[52:31] amen but maybe this will be one that'll
[52:33] uh maybe the lord will kind of
[52:35] give you something here amen kind of a
[52:38] series
[52:39] amen and we want to just speak on uh
[52:42] you know we spoke on god's thoughts and
[52:44] then last week we spoke on god's
[52:46] miracles
[52:48] and this morning i want to speak on god
[52:51] our guide god our guide
[52:54] amen amen so we just want to talk about
[52:57] god and what he is amen because he's
[52:59] certainly
[53:00] the only one worth really talking about
[53:02] amen praise the lord
[53:05] so in saint john if you will let's turn
[53:07] to saint john
[53:08] i think i've got my mic on yeah we're on
[53:12] okay
[53:13] saint john
[53:16] the 16th chapter and i was just going to
[53:19] read a few verses but
[53:21] as i went further up i just seen more
[53:23] that was it's just all good so
[53:25] i want to read from verse 1 down to
[53:29] verse 13. now these things have i spoken
[53:33] unto you that you should not be
[53:35] offended they shall put you out of the
[53:38] synagogues yea
[53:39] the time cometh that whosoever killeth
[53:42] you
[53:42] will think that they do that he doeth
[53:45] god's service
[53:47] amen quite a statement right there isn't
[53:49] it
[53:50] they'll actually kill you thinking
[53:52] they're serving god
[53:54] they're doing goddess service amen
[53:57] and these things will they do unto you
[53:59] because they have not known
[54:01] the father nor me but these things have
[54:04] i told you
[54:05] that when the time shall come you may
[54:07] remember that i told you
[54:09] of them and these things i said not unto
[54:12] you at the beginning because i was with
[54:14] you
[54:16] but now i go my way to him that sent me
[54:18] and none of you asks me whether goes
[54:20] thou
[54:21] but because i have said these things
[54:23] unto you sorrow has filled your heart
[54:26] nevertheless i tell you the truth it's
[54:28] expedient
[54:29] that i go away for you that i go away
[54:32] for if i go not away the comforter
[54:35] will not come unto you but if i depart i
[54:38] will send him
[54:39] unto you and when he is come he will
[54:42] reprove the world of sin
[54:45] of righteousness and of judgment
[54:48] of sin because they believe not on me
[54:52] knows that the original sin is unbelief
[54:54] only one sin and that is
[54:56] unbelief amen he that believeth not
[54:58] shall be damned amen
[55:00] so it is it is absolute sin to not
[55:03] believe what god said
[55:05] of righteousness because i go to my
[55:07] father in other words he's going to
[55:08] prove that what he said was right
[55:10] and everything is righteousness is only
[55:13] in christ because he did raise from the
[55:15] dead
[55:16] he did what he said he was going to do
[55:17] amen and then of course he says
[55:20] of course and you see me no more and of
[55:21] judgment because the prince of this
[55:23] world
[55:24] is judged i have yet many things
[55:28] to say you cannot bear them now how be
[55:31] it
[55:31] when he the spirit of truth is come he
[55:34] will guide you
[55:36] into all truth
[55:39] for he shall not speak of himself but
[55:41] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[55:43] speak
[55:43] and he will show you things to come may
[55:46] god add his blessings to the reading of
[55:48] the words you can be seated this morning
[55:53] amen so we see here
[55:57] that jesus clearly made it clear that
[56:01] he still had a lot of things that he
[56:03] wanted the church to know
[56:05] there's going to be a lot more things
[56:07] said
[56:08] but it's going to be when the holy
[56:09] spirit comes back in his church isn't
[56:12] that right
[56:12] and of course we realize that paul was
[56:14] one of those instruments
[56:16] that god used to speak through amen
[56:19] because paul said let him that is
[56:20] spiritual or a prophet let him
[56:22] acknowledge
[56:23] that the things that we write unto you
[56:25] are the commandments of the lord amen so
[56:28] the things that paul taught in
[56:29] corinthians and romans and hebrews
[56:32] and all these different books you know
[56:34] those are all the commandments of god
[56:35] those are all things that
[56:37] god was going to show us amen so he says
[56:40] there's going to be
[56:40] a furtherance of it but let me just
[56:43] begin with this
[56:45] by saying that we live truly we live in
[56:47] a world
[56:49] of darkness how many beliefs we're
[56:50] living in darkness
[56:52] the whole world gropes in darkness
[56:55] with no light nothing so uh
[56:58] you know how many knows that jesus was
[57:00] the light of the world in this darkness
[57:02] jesus had become the word
[57:03] had become the light amen of the world
[57:06] and he truly is the light now
[57:10] something else i want to say that we
[57:12] actually were
[57:13] born our first birth by our mom and dad
[57:17] brought us
[57:17] into a world of darkness we were
[57:20] actually born
[57:21] in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the
[57:24] world
[57:24] speaking lies how many know that's one
[57:27] of the first things that a kid will do
[57:28] when they come of age is
[57:30] tell lies and then it's the easiest
[57:32] thing for them to do is to lie about
[57:34] something
[57:35] amen we come into the world bible says
[57:36] speaking lies so we're
[57:38] born the wrong way with the wrong nature
[57:41] amen
[57:41] and we were born in darkness amen our
[57:45] eyes or shall we say
[57:46] blind amen because we were blind to god
[57:49] you can't see the things of god
[57:51] that's why jesus said that unless a man
[57:53] is born again he cannot see
[57:56] amen where he's going he cannot see the
[57:59] kingdom of god so the first thing that
[58:00] has to happen to a person
[58:02] in order for you to be able to be guided
[58:05] you know right it's for you to have your
[58:08] eyes open
[58:09] for your amen to realize what it's
[58:11] really all about what the kingdom of god
[58:13] is really all about
[58:14] so it's certainly a dark darkness that
[58:17] is around us
[58:18] and uh born in darkness and so forth
[58:21] god is truly the light of the world
[58:23] jesus is the light of the world and
[58:24] without jesus
[58:26] the whole world gropes in that
[58:29] darkness without without the light
[58:31] you're going to be
[58:32] the blind stumbling along and the jesus
[58:35] said if the blind lead the blind they're
[58:38] both going to fall in the ditch
[58:40] and i want to say that the world and the
[58:42] condition that it's going they are
[58:44] groping in darkness they are in the
[58:46] darkness of the world amen and they will
[58:49] find themselves
[58:50] in the ditch of the tribulation period
[58:53] that's why they'll find themselves one
[58:55] of these days because
[58:56] they don't have the guide to lead them
[58:58] amen
[59:00] now one place i realized probably god
[59:02] said you know those that are on the
[59:04] broad way they don't need a guide i mean
[59:06] it's easy to go down the broad way but
[59:09] to go down the narrow way
[59:10] amen you have to have a guide amen and
[59:13] this road that
[59:14] you have to have to guide on amen at
[59:16] least to everlasting life
[59:18] but the bible says there you know narrow
[59:21] is the way
[59:22] and few there be that find it
[59:26] amen so we have to have people don't
[59:30] think so but you really have to
[59:32] have a guide in this world amen
[59:35] so i'm going to preach a message out of
[59:37] the course brother man preach message on
[59:39] the guide
[59:40] amen let me just begin here can i
[59:43] now notice he says a guide has to know
[59:45] the way
[59:46] he has to know where he's going and what
[59:48] he's doing
[59:50] and how to take care of you along the
[59:52] right road
[59:53] he's got to see that you don't come up
[59:56] lost
[59:58] amen a god is a selected man the state
[1:00:01] selects this man if he is a guide and
[1:00:05] now in going on a
[1:00:07] trip in the wilderness where perhaps
[1:00:09] you're not used to going amen
[1:00:11] how many knows that you and i that we're
[1:00:13] perhaps even
[1:00:14] amen going down the road that we're not
[1:00:16] used to going
[1:00:18] amen we don't know what the future holds
[1:00:20] do we we don't know what tomorrow holds
[1:00:23] amen but we have a guide to guide us
[1:00:26] amen so now notice he says and perhaps
[1:00:29] you're not used to going
[1:00:30] it's not a good thing for you to go
[1:00:32] without one frankly
[1:00:34] some places he says you can't even go
[1:00:36] out into these mountains without a god
[1:00:39] for instance canada the god has to sign
[1:00:41] your license and the game warden
[1:00:43] he has to sign himself in and he is
[1:00:45] responsible for you if anything happens
[1:00:48] to you
[1:00:49] it's his responsibility
[1:00:54] amen amen he's got to take care of you
[1:00:57] see and if you do get lost he's got to
[1:01:00] know the country so well
[1:01:02] that he can pick you up just at any time
[1:01:05] he's got to know these things or he
[1:01:07] cannot be a guide
[1:01:09] amen he cannot be a licensed guide
[1:01:11] unless he knows the wilderness
[1:01:14] praise be to god amen
[1:01:18] and for these things he says sometimes
[1:01:20] you have to have an appointment you got
[1:01:22] to call ahead
[1:01:23] make arrangements get reservations to be
[1:01:26] taken out into these wildernesses
[1:01:29] now anybody that's ever been in the
[1:01:30] woods i only remember one time ever
[1:01:32] getting lost amen i want to only
[1:01:34] remember
[1:01:34] one time getting lost amen in the woods
[1:01:37] and it was on a
[1:01:38] on a on a lunch break amen because i
[1:01:40] love the woods and i always like to go
[1:01:42] and explore the woods and so at lunch
[1:01:44] break when i was
[1:01:45] laboring for masonry crew and so forth
[1:01:48] at lunch i went for a little walk
[1:01:50] and so i i just went for a little walk
[1:01:52] and i didn't come back till three
[1:01:53] o'clock that afternoon
[1:01:56] and of course you can just imagine you
[1:01:59] know what
[1:02:00] my boss they were like where did that
[1:02:01] guy go you know
[1:02:03] but you know you think you know where
[1:02:05] you're going hey you have no
[1:02:07] idea where you're going when you're lost
[1:02:10] you actually think you're going in one
[1:02:12] direction you're going the absolute
[1:02:13] opposite direction of what you're going
[1:02:16] and thank god that where i'm at there
[1:02:18] was a little road there wasn't too far
[1:02:19] before i hit a road
[1:02:21] and man it wouldn't have been for that
[1:02:22] how many knows how many know what the
[1:02:23] death walk is
[1:02:24] and then you go in complete circles when
[1:02:27] you're lost
[1:02:28] you end up making what the indians call
[1:02:30] the death walk you end up in the same
[1:02:32] and it is isn't it amazing i think it's
[1:02:35] it's absolutely amazing how that you
[1:02:38] wouldn't end up
[1:02:39] way out somewhere else but you're
[1:02:41] somehow or other you end up right where
[1:02:42] you was before
[1:02:45] i don't know how that works but you know
[1:02:46] that's pretty much how it works and so
[1:02:48] but you know uh you know you look at
[1:02:50] that and it's that way and
[1:02:51] in the canada out west perhaps you know
[1:02:54] if you go into places that you've never
[1:02:56] been before
[1:02:57] and the wilderness is so vast that if
[1:03:00] you go out there very far
[1:03:02] you're bound to get lost amen
[1:03:05] and you and i are in the wilderness
[1:03:07] today how many knows and without
[1:03:09] somebody
[1:03:10] amen telling you the way that knows the
[1:03:12] way knows the wilderness
[1:03:15] amen you're going to end up perishing
[1:03:18] not just lost but perishing how many
[1:03:21] knows jesus says i
[1:03:23] am the way the truth and the life no man
[1:03:25] comes to the father
[1:03:26] but by me you're not going to make it
[1:03:28] without jesus christ
[1:03:31] because he is the way amen and he knows
[1:03:34] the way
[1:03:35] he created this whole thing he laid out
[1:03:37] the wilderness
[1:03:38] so he knows the way he'll never get you
[1:03:41] lost
[1:03:42] jesus said all that come unto me i will
[1:03:45] in no wise cast now
[1:03:49] aren't you glad for following somebody
[1:03:51] like that that knows the way
[1:03:54] amen he's given us that you know he's
[1:03:56] given people don't realize it but the
[1:03:58] book of life
[1:04:00] amen the book of life this is the book
[1:04:02] of life
[1:04:03] and then if you want to know about life
[1:04:05] this is it right here
[1:04:07] the way through life the way through
[1:04:10] this wilderness is right here the
[1:04:12] directions
[1:04:13] are right here aren't you glad for that
[1:04:17] this morning because if it wasn't for
[1:04:19] that
[1:04:19] you would be as lost as lost could be
[1:04:24] you wouldn't know which way to turn you
[1:04:26] don't know where you
[1:04:27] are you don't know who you are you don't
[1:04:29] know where you come from
[1:04:32] what a terrible state to be
[1:04:36] and let me tell you isn't it sad that in
[1:04:38] our uh
[1:04:39] political world that we've taught our
[1:04:41] kids
[1:04:42] amen that we come from monkeys he they
[1:04:45] confuse them from where they come from
[1:04:48] and now they don't know what they're
[1:04:49] here for
[1:04:50] let alone where they're going it brought
[1:04:53] mass
[1:04:53] confusion amen that's
[1:04:57] partially largely the reason that the
[1:04:59] world is in the condition that it's in
[1:05:01] it's because of what we've taught the
[1:05:03] people we've gotten them away from the
[1:05:06] guys
[1:05:08] this is the guide in the beginning was
[1:05:10] the word the word was with god and the
[1:05:12] word was god and the word was made flesh
[1:05:14] jesus christ the word was made flesh
[1:05:17] and dwelt among us he came to show
[1:05:20] us the way amen aren't you glad that
[1:05:24] there's the way this morning
[1:05:26] praise be to god god found me
[1:05:31] wandering in the wilderness
[1:05:34] when i was 20 years old he found me i
[1:05:36] didn't find him
[1:05:38] he found me amen
[1:05:42] wandering lost
[1:05:45] didn't know where i was going
[1:05:46] [Applause]
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:48] hey man but i'm thankful for a guide
[1:05:51] this morning so notice he says when you

[1:05:58] make make
[1:05:59] arrangements get resurrect get
[1:06:02] reservations
[1:06:03] to be taken out now i may notice that
[1:06:05] one of these days
[1:06:06] certainly we're going to be taken out of
[1:06:08] this world we're going to be taken out
[1:06:10] of here but you better
[1:06:12] have some reservations made you better
[1:06:14] have some plans made

[1:06:24] now and if you don't get these
[1:06:26] preparations made
[1:06:27] and you're figuring that you're going to
[1:06:29] take a trip into the wilderness where
[1:06:31] you haven't been before
[1:06:32] you may come up lost and perish
[1:06:36] i want you to know that's exactly what
[1:06:38] we're going through we're through
[1:06:39] going through a wilderness right now
[1:06:42] it's a dark
[1:06:43] wilderness and it's twice as bad at
[1:06:45] night
[1:06:46] being lost still in the wilderness you
[1:06:48] can't barely see ahead of you where are
[1:06:49] you going
[1:06:50] that also typifies the world in which
[1:06:52] we're living and where we're going
[1:06:54] through
[1:06:54] it's a dark world amen and you perhaps
[1:06:57] don't know what the next step
[1:06:58] is what's going to happen next
[1:07:01] amen there's the one man one time the
[1:07:03] kingdom brother batman says i don't
[1:07:04] believe
[1:07:04] anything that you can't scientifically
[1:07:06] prove
[1:07:08] amen brother brown says contrary wise i
[1:07:10] don't believe anything that i can
[1:07:12] scientifically proof
[1:07:14] i don't believe a thing that you can
[1:07:15] scientifically prove
[1:07:19] well i'm right here that's right no
[1:07:20] you're not going to be here after a
[1:07:21] while you'll be dust
[1:07:22] that's not real huh only that which is
[1:07:26] not scientifically those things like
[1:07:28] and then he says i prove to you he meant
[1:07:30] you know he says well
[1:07:32] he said you say you love your wife well
[1:07:34] hulk show me your love
[1:07:36] how can you prove your love see you
[1:07:39] can't see it
[1:07:41] you know and then he asked man he says
[1:07:43] where do you live he says well i live up
[1:07:44] over the hill and down over the valley
[1:07:46] over there
[1:07:46] he says and it's getting dark he says
[1:07:48] how are you gonna you can't see how to
[1:07:50] get there
[1:07:51] how are you ever gonna make it he says
[1:07:53] well i got this lantern here and i'm to
[1:07:55] follow this path
[1:07:56] and i'm going to make it all the way
[1:07:57] home he says that's what we're doing
[1:07:59] i mean we're in this wilderness but
[1:08:00] we're going to go home because we got
[1:08:02] this light
[1:08:03] because of this light that we have it's
[1:08:05] going to show
[1:08:06] us how to get home it's going to show us
[1:08:10] how to get out of here
[1:08:11] without that lantern then you'd be
[1:08:13] walking and stumbling all over the place
[1:08:16] amen he that don't have no light in his
[1:08:18] life stumbles
[1:08:21] the whole world is stumbling and
[1:08:23] staggering
[1:08:24] russia is stumbling and staggering china
[1:08:27] is stumbling and staggering
[1:08:29] i mean north korea is stumbling and
[1:08:31] staggering hitler stumble and say
[1:08:34] america is certainly stumbling and
[1:08:36] falling on their face
[1:08:39] because they don't have a guide anymore
[1:08:41] they left a guy
[1:08:44] only reason that a person has to be in a
[1:08:47] lost state is because
[1:08:48] they don't follow the guide
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:55] let me tell you the only reason that you
[1:08:57] ain't got joy unspeakable and full of
[1:08:59] glory
[1:08:59] it's because you don't follow the god
[1:09:01] because this guide said that i'll give
[1:09:03] you joy
[1:09:04] that the world can't take i give you
[1:09:06] peace that passes understanding
[1:09:11] if you ain't got it don't
[1:09:14] blame god he doesn't told us how to get
[1:09:17] it
[1:09:18] amen if you ain't got it this morning
[1:09:21] don't blame god
[1:09:22] amen people that don't want to follow
[1:09:24] the god they're the only ones that's
[1:09:26] going to end up lost
[1:09:28] and on the day of judgment god's not
[1:09:30] going to say he says you know they're
[1:09:32] going to say well i wasn't saved and so
[1:09:34] forth he
[1:09:37] is just gonna say i gave you the brother
[1:09:40] didn't i
[1:09:42] i had many infallible proofs that i
[1:09:44] showed you why wouldn't you believe
[1:09:47] you didn't wore it
[1:09:51] you willfully walk away why didn't you
[1:09:53] accept that i gave you the remedy
[1:09:56] hey we got a slew of problems in this
[1:09:58] world
[1:10:00] this world's full of problems but he
[1:10:02] gave us the remedy didn't
[1:10:05] yay amen
[1:10:09] praise the lord oh you got to make some
[1:10:12] preparations let me tell you something
[1:10:14] before you leave this world you better
[1:10:15] make some
[1:10:16] arrangements you better have some
[1:10:17] preparations made you better talk to
[1:10:19] this guy
[1:10:20] because it's going to be a dark night
[1:10:22] it's going to be a dark place when you
[1:10:24] begin to take your last breath when you
[1:10:26] begin to go out of this world
[1:10:28] you better have your guide amen
[1:10:31] oh my listen to this so if you go out
[1:10:35] there and you
[1:10:36] uh take a trip you haven't been there or
[1:10:38] you come up lost you're gonna perish
[1:10:40] he says you've got about one percent
[1:10:42] chance to get out of that
[1:10:44] wilderness you get lost in some of those
[1:10:46] wilderness you got about a one
[1:10:48] percent chance that's not very much
[1:10:52] to get out of this wilderness that's
[1:10:54] right if it isn't too dense
[1:10:58] you might have one percent chance to get
[1:10:59] out by yourself but if it's very bad
[1:11:01] wilderness way back you haven't got a
[1:11:03] chance to get out
[1:11:05] let me tell you something this
[1:11:06] wilderness is bad
[1:11:08] you ain't got no chance to get out
[1:11:10] without a guy
[1:11:13] amen you find yourself on the death walk
[1:11:18] amen you're done then you're finished
[1:11:21] you'll perish if you haven't got a guy
[1:11:23] that knows the country
[1:11:24] and knows how to get you back and how to
[1:11:27] find you
[1:11:30] oh i can only imagine being out there
[1:11:32] lost amen and then finding
[1:11:34] come having your guy come walking up to
[1:11:36] you
[1:11:37] he says well i knew pretty much where he
[1:11:39] was going to be at
[1:11:41] huh and that's the way it is with god
[1:11:43] isn't that right
[1:11:44] god knows where you're at he's going to
[1:11:47] find you in this wilderness
[1:11:48] he won't lose the one because he knows
[1:11:51] the wilderness he knows where
[1:11:53] everybody's at
[1:11:54] because he's a perfect guide you love
[1:11:57] him
[1:11:58] oh my now listen to this
[1:12:02] now i'm going to take a few stories if
[1:12:03] that's okay this morning and i want to
[1:12:05] take illustrations
[1:12:06] out of those stories if i could the one
[1:12:09] is about the boy scouts in arizona that
[1:12:11] ended up going out into the wilderness
[1:12:13] in that right and they got lost
[1:12:15] it says that they were trained to know
[1:12:16] how to take care of themselves they were
[1:12:18] full scouts not partial scouts
[1:12:20] they were not just cub scouts they were
[1:12:21] full scouts and tate to
[1:12:23] trick up and trip up into the mountains
[1:12:25] and a snow storm came up
[1:12:27] nature changed its position
[1:12:30] how many believes this world is changing
[1:12:33] its position
[1:12:34] huh and they found themselves
[1:12:38] lost all of them and they perished
[1:12:41] is because something comes up and
[1:12:44] changed from the regular routine
[1:12:46] they didn't know how to get out and i
[1:12:49] don't forget how many boys that was that
[1:12:51] perished in the mountain they
[1:12:53] had helicopters to militia out the
[1:12:55] general guards
[1:12:56] national guards volunteer help and
[1:12:58] everything but they were lost
[1:13:00] no one knew where they were at and they
[1:13:02] could not take care of themselves
[1:13:04] they all perished in the snow because
[1:13:07] they didn't know whether they was going
[1:13:11] east
[1:13:11] or north or west up or down and how it
[1:13:14] was
[1:13:15] everything looked the same whenever
[1:13:18] change
[1:13:18] come amen they didn't know how to deal
[1:13:22] with that change in their right
[1:13:25] they didn't have somebody that had the
[1:13:27] knowledge of what was going on
[1:13:30] let me just take it a little bit back if
[1:13:32] i could let's talk about israel but how
[1:13:34] many knows that it was god
[1:13:36] that pulled israel out of egypt and they
[1:13:39] began to follow moses he was their
[1:13:41] leader
[1:13:42] amen let me say he was their leader but
[1:13:44] he was not their guy
[1:13:47] amen why because god was their guide
[1:13:51] is that right and so whenever change
[1:13:54] happened to them and they got out into
[1:13:55] that wilderness
[1:13:56] they come down to that red sea and they
[1:13:58] couldn't turn to the left they couldn't
[1:14:00] turn to the right
[1:14:02] they come to a dead end
[1:14:06] they had a change to come something
[1:14:09] happened that they weren't used to
[1:14:10] oh they were dancing and they were
[1:14:12] shouting when they were leaving
[1:14:14] but little did they know what was laid
[1:14:16] ahead now let me tell you this about our
[1:14:18] great god our great leader
[1:14:22] our great leader is not what the world
[1:14:24] thinks that he is a lot of times
[1:14:26] because we would think oh god's going to
[1:14:28] lead you into amen shady green pastures
[1:14:31] all the time
[1:14:32] that he's going to lead you to a flowery
[1:14:35] bed of ease
[1:14:36] that everything's going to go good
[1:14:38] that's not how our guide guides us
[1:14:42] he don't guide us into all these
[1:14:44] wonderful great places
[1:14:45] these boys they'd have been fine perhaps
[1:14:47] if the weather would have stayed the
[1:14:49] same and everything would have stayed
[1:14:50] the same but things changed on them
[1:14:52] just like god allows change to come into
[1:14:55] your life he allows change to come into
[1:14:57] my life
[1:14:59] amen because he wants to see what we're
[1:15:01] going to do at those times
[1:15:04] amen
[1:15:07] the song says in shady green pastures so
[1:15:12] rich and so
[1:15:13] sweet god leads his dear children alone
[1:15:16] amen just like brother danny said just
[1:15:18] like i testified when i first
[1:15:21] got born again i thought i could just
[1:15:23] almost float up in the air and float
[1:15:25] away
[1:15:25] because i felt my shoulders were so
[1:15:27] light amen i was so
[1:15:28] oh my name is such a piece such a
[1:15:31] wonderful feeling
[1:15:32] i couldn't express it he was just so
[1:15:34] awesome
[1:15:35] huh it was so beautiful kind of like the
[1:15:38] story of the eagles in the nest
[1:15:39] amen it was such nice wool it's such a
[1:15:42] beautiful place
[1:15:43] but then after a while god begins to
[1:15:45] take some of that wool away
[1:15:47] he let stickers come up amen and poke
[1:15:49] you
[1:15:50] and things we get uncomfortable things
[1:15:53] get all terribly failing and everything
[1:15:55] else
[1:15:56] there's churches and they have fusses
[1:15:58] and fights and they have this that are
[1:15:59] in the other
[1:16:00] we've got where i come from all kinds of
[1:16:02] false doctrines floating around and
[1:16:04] people criticizing the pastor and
[1:16:06] everything else oh man i thought we all
[1:16:08] was happier i want big happy family
[1:16:11] a sticker here and a sticker there
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:15] uh all that wonderful feeling and you
[1:16:17] begin to say whoa what is all this well
[1:16:19] that's just like a little
[1:16:20] eagle story so with god begin to bring
[1:16:23] israel down to the rescue and
[1:16:24] bring them to a place where they
[1:16:25] couldn't get nowhere they didn't know
[1:16:27] what to do what did we do
[1:16:30] and what was the first thing they did
[1:16:35] did they say look i know that it was god
[1:16:39] that led us here huh
[1:16:42] and i know we can't go forward and the
[1:16:44] egyptians we hear them
[1:16:45] you hear them that thunder that's a
[1:16:49] 50 000 chariots coming after us that's
[1:16:52] the sign of horses that sound of trained
[1:16:54] soldiers coming to get us
[1:16:55] to take us and make us slaves again the
[1:16:58] enemy is hot on our heels so to speak
[1:17:00] but nowhere to go did they say did they
[1:17:03] say
[1:17:04] i know that the one that led us here

[1:19:42] there wasn't enough graves in egypt
[1:19:44] god saw that sorely displeased god
[1:19:48] when they complained and when they
[1:19:50] remembered
[1:19:53] the bible even says because of their
[1:19:54] complaining and their murmuring
[1:19:56] he said that he sent fiery serpents
[1:19:58] among them and they bit them and they
[1:20:02] oh they spiritually died because they
[1:20:05] complained and they murmured

[1:20:23] the holy ghost don't do that the holy
[1:20:25] ghost says look
[1:20:26] though he sends me to hell yet i'll
[1:20:28] praise him
[1:20:30] like don't he slay me yet i'll trust him
[1:20:34] that's what the holy ghost said amen
[1:20:37] dude
[1:20:37] job's wife said why don't you just curse
[1:20:39] god and now you speak like a foolish
[1:20:41] woman
[1:20:42] the lord gave the lord take it away
[1:20:44] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:20:46] that's what the holy ghost says are you
[1:20:48] with me this morning
[1:20:50] holy ghost is always positive and that's
[1:20:53] what god was looking for out of the
[1:20:54] children of israel
[1:20:56] even though he guided him into that
[1:20:57] place at that place of something that's
[1:21:00] different
[1:21:01] a place of change let me tell you some
[1:21:04] how many knows we're living in the world
[1:21:06] of change
[1:21:07] what does that mean that just means you
[1:21:09] need to hold the hand of your guide a
[1:21:11] little bit closer
[1:21:12] stay close to the guide when it gets
[1:21:15] dark and you don't have a light
[1:21:17] and man or not you get five a foot away
[1:21:20] from your guide
[1:21:21] you might not be able to see him and
[1:21:22] then i don't know about you but i'm
[1:21:23] gonna hold his hand give me your hand
[1:21:25] don't you let go man
[1:21:27] i'm counting on you to get me home
[1:21:29] because you're responsible for me
[1:21:31] oh man i'm persuaded paul says that the
[1:21:35] one that has started a good work in me
[1:21:37] is able to perform it but you got to say
[1:21:39] in him amen i believe it was jesus said
[1:21:41] that
[1:21:42] he did abideth in me and me and him amen
[1:21:46] the same shall bring forth much fruit if
[1:21:49] you abide in me and i abide in you but
[1:21:51] god
[1:21:52] you're going to be lost really quick
[1:21:55] amen
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:21:58] and finally the children of israel
[1:22:01] were all lost how many of they were lost
[1:22:03] because of their unbelief
[1:22:05] because every time they come to a new
[1:22:07] place a strange place
[1:22:10] this thing's changed that right
[1:22:14] how many knows it should have been good
[1:22:15] enough when god opened up the red sea
[1:22:18] they walked out on dry land amen
[1:22:22] the clay down in the bottom of that
[1:22:25] river whatever it was that
[1:22:26] knee-deep mud dried up they could ride
[1:22:29] their horses and their cows with their
[1:22:30] hooves that would dig in
[1:22:32] they all went on dry ground across the
[1:22:35] whoo
[1:22:36] can you ima i don't know about you but i
[1:22:38] had to join miriam
[1:22:39] i'd have been with them sisters probably
[1:22:41] dancing up and down them
[1:22:43] said well look how great god is
[1:22:46] we serve our awesome god that's right
[1:22:49] how many believe we serve our awesome
[1:22:50] god
[1:22:51] because i want to tell you right now
[1:22:52] that we're going right down in the
[1:22:54] middle of satan's eating
[1:22:55] we're right in the dead middle of
[1:22:57] satan's evening we're making this
[1:22:58] journey amen and we love god more than
[1:23:01] we
[1:23:01] ever have we worship him more than ever
[1:23:03] we praise him more than ever
[1:23:05] hallelujah that's a miracle in itself
[1:23:09] everybody is getting lukewarm
[1:23:12] everybody's getting lackadaisical
[1:23:15] ray leia's rubbing off on people
[1:23:19] people's worried about polish
[1:23:21] i'm not you just go go go search what
[1:23:23] brother madam said about politics and
[1:23:24] getting your mind off of this politics
[1:23:26] mess
[1:23:27] either get your mind off all that mess
[1:23:30] amen she says that's all a bunch of
[1:23:32] foolishness and then i found that quote
[1:23:34] better scene where he talks about god
[1:23:36] says he thinks it's all a bunch of
[1:23:37] foolishness
[1:23:39] it doesn't matter but around it don't
[1:23:40] matter a bit who's the next president
[1:23:42] ain't gonna do anything for you all
[1:23:44] right it's all
[1:23:45] it's all long gone anyway after 56 it
[1:23:49] didn't really matter who was president
[1:23:51] it didn't matter who was president in
[1:23:52] 1956 it's history
[1:23:54] it's gone it's gonna burn
[1:23:59] hello so get our minds off of all of
[1:24:02] that rubbish
[1:24:03] and let's get it on the word of god
[1:24:05] let's get it on god
[1:24:06] let's think about our guide that is
[1:24:08] guiding us through this wilderness
[1:24:10] saying lord god me don't you let go of
[1:24:13] my hand and then we're going through
[1:24:14] dangerous places dark places lord i need
[1:24:17] your hand
[1:24:20] amen i'll be lost and perish
[1:24:23] because there's too many wolves out
[1:24:25] there hungry wolves that are ready to
[1:24:27] devour you
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:29] amen you better stay close to the guy
[1:24:32] because god the guy's got
[1:24:33] all the things that you need to survive
[1:24:37] this world has everything you need to
[1:24:39] survive
[1:24:40] praise the lord all right
[1:24:48] all right so now notice now we're going
[1:24:51] through a wilderness
[1:24:52] we're on our road somewhere and we can't
[1:24:54] get along without this guy
[1:24:56] and dare anybody to try to substitute
[1:25:00] any other guide
[1:25:03] huh if you do he'll take a line
[1:25:08] and that right this guy knows the way he
[1:25:10] knows every inch of the way
[1:25:12] he knows every thought that's in your
[1:25:14] heart and so forth a guide a correct
[1:25:16] guide
[1:25:16] he will guide you to all of
[1:25:19] the truth
[1:25:23] how many knows that's where the problem
[1:25:25] lays i mean if people don't want them
[1:25:28] the truth that god gives after amen he
[1:25:30] left the earth
[1:25:32] they don't want all the truth
[1:25:35] amen praise the lord
[1:25:39] all right let me uh give you another
[1:25:43] story first can i
[1:25:52] an unthoughtful father and i thought the
[1:25:56] father two years ago in colorado
[1:25:58] he was going up into the mountains and
[1:26:00] he had a little boy about six seven
[1:26:02] years old
[1:26:03] he was going to take him on his first
[1:26:05] deer hunt
[1:26:06] so they went high in the mountains and
[1:26:08] the little boy said to daddy daddy i'm
[1:26:10] getting tired
[1:26:11] how many knows that little boy is just
[1:26:13] not going to be able to go as far as
[1:26:15] what you go
[1:26:16] so first of all i don't know about you
[1:26:18] but if it was me
[1:26:20] i would kind of find out how far my son
[1:26:22] can go on his own two feet and back
[1:26:24] so i have to pack him on my back if i
[1:26:26] didn't want to go further
[1:26:28] i have to say how much strength how
[1:26:29] young am i am i my 20s 30s 40s
[1:26:31] how how young am i how far can i carry
[1:26:33] this boy myself
[1:26:35] back how many knows you need to
[1:26:37] calculate for those things this man
[1:26:38] didn't calculate for that
[1:26:40] he was unthoughtful father so they went
[1:26:42] high in the mountains a little boy said
[1:26:44] i'm getting tired
[1:26:45] he said get on my back we're not high
[1:26:47] enough yet the deers are way up on high
[1:26:50] way up there
[1:26:51] he didn't know he was a city man he
[1:26:53] didn't know nothing about how to hunt or
[1:26:54] where to go
[1:26:55] and any man knows and uh anything about
[1:26:58] the wilderness knows the day
[1:26:59] the deer don't stay up there on them
[1:27:01] rocks and them high places
[1:27:02] they'll go up there goats stay up there
[1:27:04] not there they're down here where they
[1:27:06] can feed
[1:27:08] and they got to get to where there's
[1:27:09] something to eat and so but this man
[1:27:11] thought
[1:27:12] if i got way up there in the rocks sway
[1:27:14] up here
[1:27:15] i'll find a big buck i mean this is a
[1:27:18] good time to sell this isn't it
[1:27:19] and he had seen a picture all right
[1:27:21] here's the point he had seen a picture
[1:27:24] of some standing up on a big rock so he
[1:27:26] thought that's where he'd find him
[1:27:28] amen let me tell you something there's
[1:27:31] millions
[1:27:32] of people that's going to be lost
[1:27:33] because they've been painted the wrong
[1:27:35] picture
[1:27:37] they're following the wrong thought
[1:27:41] amen oh well god doesn't care about how
[1:27:43] you dress
[1:27:44] or what is that that's the wrong picture
[1:27:48] amen let me finish the story
[1:27:52] he had seen some picture up there all
[1:27:55] right he thought
[1:27:56] that's where he'd find him don't you pay
[1:27:58] attention to what the magazines read and
[1:28:00] so forth
[1:28:00] you'll have a nightmare there's only one
[1:28:02] thing to do is to take a guide where you
[1:28:04] know
[1:28:05] where you're at and this man didn't know
[1:28:08] where he was what he was doing
[1:28:09] he had nobody with him to direct him and
[1:28:12] he held his own little son against his
[1:28:14] bosom
[1:28:14] until he felt him cool off and die
[1:28:18] it got stormy that night uh i didn't
[1:28:21] read some of it but he talks about how
[1:28:22] that he went way up too high
[1:28:24] and it got dark on it and then it got
[1:28:26] cold
[1:28:28] amen and he had to pull up his own son
[1:28:31] into his bosom
[1:28:32] and he cooled off and he died
[1:28:34] unthoughtful if he just had a guide with
[1:28:37] him
[1:28:37] he cut it could have brought him right
[1:28:39] back down the mountains regardless
[1:28:41] of what time that it was how many knows
[1:28:44] you may get into places where you never
[1:28:46] know that you don't know what's going on
[1:28:48] but
[1:28:48] if you've got a guide he has a way of
[1:28:50] bringing you back where you're supposed
[1:28:52] to be
[1:28:52] i'm just thankful for that if you ever
[1:28:54] go off somewhere you know you
[1:28:56] stray away from god if your god is your
[1:29:00] god he'll catch you and he'll bring you
[1:29:02] back right where you're supposed to be
[1:29:04] and this man he was unthoughtful what
[1:29:06] did he do it cost his own life
[1:29:07] and his cost son's life because of a
[1:29:09] picture that had been painted him a
[1:29:12] thought that was in his mind
[1:29:13] i thought about the denominational
[1:29:15] churches amen
[1:29:17] of how they they'll tell people they'll
[1:29:19] live any way you want do anything you
[1:29:21] want ah you'll be in heaven that is a
[1:29:23] false picture folks
[1:29:24] you're going to find yourself in the
[1:29:26] tribulation period god doesn't work that
[1:29:28] way
[1:29:28] how many is this guy he knows what he's
[1:29:30] doing but you have to
[1:29:32] people think they know about more about
[1:29:34] it than the guy does
[1:29:38] lean to their own understanding more
[1:29:39] than the vindicated proven word of god
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:46] my my let's talk about another one let's
[1:29:49] talk about these death walk for a minute
[1:29:52] the death walk round
[1:29:56] go again i this time let me just pick up
[1:29:59] a story
[1:30:00] while i'm at it brother batman remember
[1:30:02] when he was taking his wife on his
[1:30:03] honeymoon
[1:30:04] and he went up into these mountains
[1:30:05] right and he went way up there
[1:30:08] he went so far up there and i believe it
[1:30:10] was snowing and he was got real blizzard
[1:30:12] in everything and he says i better get
[1:30:14] back
[1:30:14] and so he hit it back and he hit it back
[1:30:17] and went way back there
[1:30:18] and all of a sudden he found himself
[1:30:20] right back by his kill
[1:30:22] how did i get here and he says ah i'm a
[1:30:25] guide
[1:30:26] i can find my way out of here he tried
[1:30:29] it again
[1:30:30] and he ended up there same place again
[1:30:34] huh and the third time he says well i'm
[1:30:36] going to try with everything i got i i
[1:30:38] know
[1:30:39] which way to go and i show something
[1:30:41] touched him on his shoulder and that
[1:30:42] right
[1:30:43] says i'm a very present help in time of
[1:30:45] trouble just call on me
[1:30:47] folks if you're going in circles being
[1:30:49] maybe because of your unbelief or amen
[1:30:51] because you think you can guide yourself
[1:30:53] i can do this you're going in circles
[1:30:55] and there's
[1:30:55] too much unbelief there you better call
[1:30:57] on the guy and say god help
[1:30:58] i need a little help here you can't go
[1:31:01] you can't go
[1:31:02] your own way and expect that you're
[1:31:03] going to come out right
[1:31:05] no it has to be the way that god you
[1:31:07] need the help of almighty god if you're
[1:31:09] ever going to make this out of right
[1:31:12] amen otherwise what do you do when you
[1:31:15] go your own way and you think you can do
[1:31:17] it all you're going to do is on a giant
[1:31:19] death walk
[1:31:20] go round and round let me try this again
[1:31:23] let me try this again
[1:31:25] it's just a death walk when god ever
[1:31:27] reaches down
[1:31:28] a minute he grabs a hold of your hand
[1:31:30] because we know that brother madam said
[1:31:32] the third time he was going to go and he
[1:31:33] was going to
[1:31:34] he's going to head out he started to go
[1:31:36] didn't he he started to head out
[1:31:38] and something touched him on his
[1:31:39] shoulder in the right and he looked back
[1:31:42] when he looked back
[1:31:44] um god's hand opened up all of that
[1:31:46] storm and all of that snow
[1:31:48] and he opened up a channel to where he
[1:31:50] could see that tower and that line that
[1:31:51] tower i believe it was
[1:31:53] and that right just just give him a
[1:31:55] glimpse
[1:31:56] he says if i went the way i thought that
[1:31:58] i was going to go he says i would have
[1:32:00] headed straight towards canada
[1:32:02] he was going the perfectly wrong way
[1:32:04] thinking that he with
[1:32:05] all of his ability all of his knowledge
[1:32:08] of the woods
[1:32:09] huh can we say that about ourselves that
[1:32:12] all of our ability and all of our
[1:32:14] knowledge of the word if you try to do
[1:32:15] it your way
[1:32:16] you're going to end up heading the
[1:32:18] perfectly wrong direction
[1:32:22] it's not about your knowledge and your
[1:32:23] ability it's about surrendering to
[1:32:25] almighty god
[1:32:27] amen and let him open up the way so that
[1:32:29] you can see
[1:32:30] and then that closed back up but he knew
[1:32:32] which way to go and he was going through
[1:32:34] that stuff and he'd feel his tree he'd
[1:32:35] feel this
[1:32:36] but he was a they had run a wire from an
[1:32:38] understand from that tower down to their
[1:32:40] cabin and if you ever could get a hold
[1:32:42] of that wire he knew he had it
[1:32:44] and he went and he fell down fell
[1:32:46] finally he grabbed that wire
[1:32:50] i don't know about you but he was a
[1:32:51] happy man why because he had the
[1:32:54] lifeline now
[1:32:56] brother bam says that's the way it was
[1:32:57] with brother branham that's the way it
[1:32:58] was with danny that's the way it was me
[1:33:00] any of you
[1:33:01] that's born again amen you didn't know
[1:33:03] where to go you didn't know how to do it
[1:33:04] but he showed you the way
[1:33:06] if you can believe them lord jesus
[1:33:08] christ thou shalt be saved
[1:33:10] and when that drops down into your heart
[1:33:11] get repent be baptized in the name of
[1:33:13] the lord jesus christ
[1:33:14] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:33:16] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:33:19] if you ever got that if that ever
[1:33:22] absolutely manifests to you you have got
[1:33:24] a hold of that wire folks
[1:33:26] it just saved your life you got a hold
[1:33:30] of something that'll lead you and guide
[1:33:32] you
[1:33:32] amen until you're 58 years old from 20.
[1:33:35] and it doesn't matter how many dead ends
[1:33:37] it seems like you come to
[1:33:39] know many times how many times you feel
[1:33:41] like you run out of food and run out of
[1:33:42] water and
[1:33:43] all kinds of bad stuff happens to you it
[1:33:45] doesn't matter
[1:33:46] as long as you got a guide he will guide
[1:33:49] you
[1:33:50] through it
[1:33:53] brother bam said the greatest miracles
[1:33:55] aren't the ones that you see the eyes
[1:33:56] coming to
[1:33:58] you know coming and the ears opening
[1:34:01] he says the greatest miracles is when
[1:34:03] you can't go over it can't go under
[1:34:04] can't go around
[1:34:06] and if you just wait on god and watch
[1:34:08] god take you through
[1:34:09] that's the greatest miracle amen how
[1:34:12] many believe that
[1:34:14] praise the lord because i don't know
[1:34:15] about you but there's nobody here that
[1:34:17] wants to do
[1:34:18] like israel did huh
[1:34:21] and that was when they come out of egypt
[1:34:22] they all rejoice with miriam
[1:34:24] and all they were praising god but
[1:34:26] little did they know only 40 miles
[1:34:29] only 40 miles isn't that right and it
[1:34:32] took them 40 years to get 40 miles
[1:34:37] but the bible taught us he says that
[1:34:38] those people were not fit
[1:34:40] to go into the promised land yet they
[1:34:42] wouldn't believe god so guess what they
[1:34:44] had to go through around the testing
[1:34:45] hill
[1:34:46] the testing hill the testing mountains
[1:34:48] go around and around and around and
[1:34:50] around
[1:34:50] it meant to get rid of all the unbelief
[1:34:52] sometimes we have to go in circles and
[1:34:54] circles
[1:34:54] to get rid of the unbelief until it's
[1:34:56] gone isn't that right it's not
[1:35:00] not it's a terrible place to be amen
[1:35:03] we don't want to go in circles we want
[1:35:05] to go straight towards calvin amen
[1:35:07] praise the lord amen no
[1:35:11] amen all right let's talk about another
[1:35:14] one
[1:35:15] let's talk about when a man is lost amen

[1:38:17] people doing today
[1:38:20] writing all over their self and not with
[1:38:23] the ink that can be rubbed off but

[1:38:43] their face or body they you know
[1:38:45] they ink themselves yeah that's pretty
[1:38:47] much what a lost person looks like
[1:38:50] they're not happy with their self it's
[1:38:51] like but nana said about the boy i said
[1:38:53] he's not happy with yourself
[1:38:55] when you've got to do things like that
[1:38:56] you're not happy with yourself you have
[1:38:57] to change something
[1:38:59] woman not happy with long hair she'll

[1:39:22] and he was thought he was a rancher and
[1:39:24] he was in the wrong
[1:39:26] territory and he got lost turned around
[1:39:28] and when they found him three days later
[1:39:31] he was
[1:39:31] running like a wild man screaming to the
[1:39:35] top of his voice
[1:39:37] his lips were all eat up he throwed his
[1:39:39] gun away
[1:39:41] huh think about it your only defense

[1:40:09] the possum if i could
[1:40:13] but this boy his means of survival he
[1:40:16] threw it away because he lost his mind
[1:40:19] and that right that's what happens with
[1:40:21] people that lose your mind didn't

[1:43:43] do things that the ordinary man would
[1:43:45] never do
[1:43:47] he'll do things beyond the thoughts of
[1:43:49] human being
[1:43:51] doing huh
[1:43:56] can i just preach what comes to mind
[1:43:58] back in the early 1900s if a woman would
[1:44:00] have went out there
[1:44:01] dressed like they do today the shales
[1:44:05] would have been full they would have
[1:44:06] arrested her
[1:44:07] now right they would have arrested her
[1:44:10] even for wearing pants
[1:44:13] huh or these mini skirts and think they
[1:44:15] arrested her
[1:44:16] they just said she's crazy huh
[1:44:20] prostitutes still wear miniskirts isn't
[1:44:22] that right they'd go out there and wear
[1:44:23] mini skirts
[1:44:24] while i was going through town today
[1:44:25] right there in front of the churches
[1:44:26] what was standing up front ready to go
[1:44:28] in
[1:44:29] women with tight jeans a garment that
[1:44:32] pertains to a man the bible says is an
[1:44:34] abomination in the sight of god
[1:44:37] you dress like a man you cross-dressing
[1:44:39] is what you're doing
[1:44:40] wasn't right back in the old days but
[1:44:42] now it's okay no it's not okay with god
[1:44:44] yet
[1:44:45] and men that are so feminist until
[1:44:48] they'll wear women's clothes
[1:44:50] amen all right
[1:44:56] there she was one with a mini skirt and
[1:44:57] one with with pants on them said well
[1:44:59] look there
[1:45:00] that's what it is how many knows what
[1:45:01] the holy ghost is doing with you and my
[1:45:03] me the bible says in revel let me show
[1:45:05] you what what god is leading us to
[1:45:07] where he has led us this will be kind of
[1:45:09] coming to a close
[1:45:10] but over revelations 18 how many knows
[1:45:12] that god leads his dear children along
[1:45:14] some through the water some through the
[1:45:16] fire some through the flood
[1:45:17] but all through the blood how many of
[1:45:19] these he's got one that one place that
[1:45:20] god leads us to all through
[1:45:22] is the blood of jesus christ and he
[1:45:24] leads us to calvary to a death to
[1:45:26] ourself
[1:45:27] amen amen i know i didn't there's
[1:45:29] different things i didn't want to didn't
[1:45:31] say
[1:45:31] talking about abraham coming out and
[1:45:33] saying leave your kindred leave your kin
[1:45:35] folks leave all of them come out here
[1:45:36] and be separate
[1:45:37] follow me but you sometimes you can't
[1:45:39] follow your family
[1:45:41] if you love your wife your brother your
[1:45:42] sister your husband if you love them
[1:45:44] more than you love god you're not
[1:45:45] ready to follow this guide you cannot be
[1:45:48] my disciples jesus said unless you're
[1:45:49] willing to forsake all
[1:45:51] and follow me don't even try to guess me
[1:45:53] to be your guide
[1:45:54] that's one of the first requirements
[1:45:55] jesus makes if i'm going to be your
[1:45:57] guide
[1:45:58] you better listen to what i tell you and
[1:46:00] you'll be willing to forsake all your
[1:46:02] ideas
[1:46:02] i don't need your input i know this
[1:46:04] woods backwards forwards i can walk
[1:46:06] these hills and mountains blindfolded
[1:46:08] okay
[1:46:09] i don't need your input how many
[1:46:12] believes that
[1:46:13] so that's the way it is folks if you had
[1:46:15] to have this guide amen
[1:46:16] and we're following him i'm at least
[1:46:19] we're following christ
[1:46:20] into all truth the opening of the seven
[1:46:24] seals revealing what the antichrist
[1:46:26] really is
[1:46:27] showing is exactly how dark it really is
[1:46:30] showing us the perils of this world and
[1:46:32] the mark of the beast and what it really
[1:46:34] is so that we don't what
[1:46:36] get caught in that storm so we don't get
[1:46:39] caught with the mark of the beast
[1:46:41] amen because how many knows
[1:46:43] denominationalism churches
[1:46:45] are the mark of the beast because they
[1:46:48] have all committed fornication
[1:46:50] and they have become the cage of every
[1:46:52] unclean and hateful world homosexuals
[1:46:55] are welcome in the church now
[1:46:56] lesbians are all welcome in the church
[1:46:58] now huh
[1:47:00] even to becoming preachers
[1:47:03] it's it's it's a terrible place
[1:47:06] and god is what does he what has he done
[1:47:08] he has sent an angel
[1:47:10] to call us out come out of her my people
[1:47:13] revelations 18 after these things i saw
[1:47:16] another angel come down from heaven
[1:47:17] having great power
[1:47:19] and the earth was lightened with his
[1:47:21] glory
[1:47:22] and he cried mightily with his strong
[1:47:24] voice
[1:47:25] saying babylon the great is fallen is
[1:47:28] fallen
[1:47:28] and it's become the habitation of devils
[1:47:31] the hold of every fowl spirit
[1:47:33] and the cage of every unclean and
[1:47:36] hateful bird
[1:47:38] you can do anything you can be anything
[1:47:40] unclean
[1:47:41] and hate those that are good
[1:47:45] amen all nations have drunk of the wine
[1:47:48] of the
[1:47:48] wrath of her fornication and the kings
[1:47:51] of the
[1:47:52] earth have committed fornication with
[1:47:54] her and the merchants of the
[1:47:56] earth are waxed rich through the
[1:47:58] abundance of her delicacies
[1:48:00] and i heard another voice from heaven
[1:48:02] saying come out of her
