[35:56] foreign
[36:23] children can be dismissed to Sunday
[36:25] school
[36:26] turn with me if you will to
[36:29] Psalms 111.
[36:57] where you see the Lord I will praise the
[36:59] Lord with my whole heart in the Assembly
[37:01] of the upright and in the congregation
[37:10] this work is Honorable and glorious and
[37:13] his righteousness endureth forever
[37:23] he hath given me unto them that fear Him
[37:26] He will ever be mindful of his Covenant
[37:38] The Works of his hands are Verity and
[37:41] judgment all his Commandments are sure
[37:50] he sent Redemption unto his people he
[37:53] hath commanded his Covenant forever holy
[37:56] and Reverend is his name and this one
[37:59] together the fear of the Lord is the
[38:01] beginning of wisdom and good
[38:03] understanding have all day that do his
[38:06] Commandments his praise and Earth
[38:08] forever
[38:09] man um
[38:21] I guess I better leave that up I was
[38:23] thinking I had a mic though sorry if you
[38:26] would turn with me in your Bibles we'll
[38:27] do a little a little lesson this morning
[38:29] out of the book of Romans
[38:32] chapter one
[38:37] hope you've had a good week
[38:41] some of you have anyway
[38:43] God's been good to us all
[38:46] there you go uh the book uh I've been
[38:49] studying myself in the Book of Romans
[38:51] and kind of looking and and going that
[38:54] direction but and just reading what
[38:55] different Scholars and different uh
[38:57] theologians different ones and prophet
[39:00] and different ones said about it and uh
[39:03] you know the book of Romans is is
[39:04] probably one of the
[39:05] uh considered one of the greatest books
[39:08] in the Bible written books of the Bible
[39:10] some different ones I'll just give you
[39:12] some of the things that said Martin
[39:13] Luther he prays it he said it is the
[39:16] chief part of the New Testament the
[39:18] perfect gospel the absolute epitome of
[39:20] the Gospel
[39:22] um uh someone else that is the
[39:24] compendium of Christian doctrine uh
[39:27] anyone who understands this epistle any
[39:29] so anyone who understands this letter he
[39:31] has a passage open to him to the
[39:33] understanding of the whole scripture
[39:35] and the it's also been said it's the
[39:37] most profound work in existence so it
[39:40] just goes on and on and on
[39:42] people's read this and I think what is
[39:44] so intriguing about the book of Romans
[39:46] uh is you've got Paul writing it after
[39:48] Paul had been preaching for around 20
[39:49] years I think it was they think uh he
[39:52] preaches out of the starts writing and
[39:54] preaching to the Romans this is a place
[39:57] that was uh he did not found the church
[39:59] in Rome uh but it's thought
[40:03] posted in the book of Acts that there
[40:05] were Romans around during during the
[40:08] time on the day of Pentecost and those
[40:09] those Romans had went back and started a
[40:11] church kind of on their own kind of took
[40:13] what they had and what they knew and
[40:14] went with it and now Paul's excited to
[40:17] come and talk to these Romans now so
[40:19] let's read if we could out of Romans 1
[40:24] and we'll read about 17 verses as I go
[40:26] down through there uh Paul a servant of
[40:29] Jesus Christ called to be an apostle
[40:31] separated unto the gospel of God which
[40:34] he had promised before By His prophets
[40:36] and holy scriptures concerning his son
[40:39] Jesus Christ Our Lord which was
[40:42] he's made of the seat of David according
[40:43] to the Flesh and declared to be the Son
[40:46] of God with power according to the
[40:48] spirit of Holiness by the resurrection
[40:50] from the dead by whom we have received
[40:53] Grace and apostleship to the faith among
[40:56] all nations for his name among whom are
[40:59] ye so-called of Jesus Christ to all that
[41:02] be in Rome beloved of God Called to be
[41:05] Saints grace to you and peace from God
[41:08] our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:10] first I thank my God through Jesus
[41:12] Christ for you all that your faith is
[41:15] spoken of throughout the whole world
[41:17] for God is my witness whom I serve with
[41:19] my spirit in the gospel of his son that
[41:22] without ceasing I make mention of you
[41:24] always in my prayers
[41:26] making requests if by any means now at
[41:29] length I may have a prosperous journey
[41:31] by the will of God to come unto you
[41:34] I long to see you and I may impart into
[41:36] you some spiritual gift to the end may
[41:38] be established that is that I may be
[41:41] comforted together with you by the
[41:43] mutual Faith both of you and me
[41:46] now I would not have you be ignorant
[41:48] Brethren that oftentimes I purpose to
[41:50] come to you unto you but was let
[41:53] hitherto that I may have some fruit
[41:55] among you also as among the Gentiles
[42:01] um that are both the Greeks
[42:02] anti-barbarians both the wise and the
[42:04] unwise so as much in as me is so let me
[42:09] start that so as much as in me is I'm
[42:12] ready to preach the gospel to you that
[42:14] are at Rome also for I am not ashamed of
[42:17] the gospel of Christ for it is the power
[42:20] of God unto salvation to everyone that
[42:23] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[42:25] the Greek for therein is the
[42:28] righteousness of God revealed from from
[42:30] Faith to Faith as it is written the just
[42:33] shall live by faith so when we read this
[42:37] we it's really astonishing to me that as
[42:40] Paul writes is because you know Paul he
[42:42] wasn't always the most upstanding
[42:44] Christian uh he thought he was in his
[42:46] ways uh but it took it took God coming
[42:49] down and striking striking Ms all and
[42:51] and there's a conversion that took place
[42:53] and he himself had to start going
[42:55] through the persecution and so then he
[42:58] says you know this is after he stoned
[43:00] Stephen and all this has happened and
[43:01] he's he's persecuting and Steve and
[43:03] stoning and then he comes up and and
[43:05] basically now he's writing this letter
[43:08] and says I'm a new person
[43:10] I'm a new man and this is where all of
[43:12] us as Christians have had to have found
[43:14] ourselves and as you read through this
[43:17] scripture here you see different things
[43:18] and I want to read to you uh just
[43:20] something here that in in August of 1513
[43:24] there was a monk and he was studying in
[43:26] the book and he went and he was studying
[43:28] in the Book of Psalms actually the
[43:30] Psalms 31 and this monk was who we know
[43:33] as Martin Luther and he's reading in
[43:36] Psalms 31 and he's reading there and in
[43:39] Psalms 31
[43:40] it says envo Lord do I put my trust let
[43:44] me never be ashamed deliver me in thy
[43:47] righteousness and as he read this this
[43:49] passage began to confuse him and this
[43:52] passage begin to uh make you think in
[43:55] God's righteousness uh how can I be
[43:58] delivered if it's God's righteousness
[44:00] how can I be delivered
[44:02] when God is so great God is as
[44:05] it's amazing God can do anything I can't
[44:08] be nowhere near that so how can I even
[44:10] find myself
[44:11] standing before God I'm not good enough
[44:14] to be before God and I think a lot of
[44:16] times young Christians especially they
[44:18] find themselves in a place that they say
[44:20] how can I come to church how can I go to
[44:22] the functions how can I do these things
[44:24] because I'm not good enough well let me
[44:26] ask you how many of us ever was good
[44:29] enough
[44:30] we're never good enough but it's but but
[44:33] then as he began to read this Luther
[44:35] goes down and he begins to then reflect
[44:37] back on what was said in Romans 1 17 and
[44:41] he looked at this and it says the
[44:43] righteous of God is revealed through
[44:45] faith for faith that is written he who
[44:47] through faith is righteous shall live so
[44:51] it's by our faith that we stand on a
[44:54] day-to-day basis it's not by anything we
[44:56] do it's not by any of our merits it's
[44:58] not by our good works it's not by our
[45:00] offerings our tithes but it's simply by
[45:03] faith that we can look at the cross the
[45:06] same cross that Saul had to look at
[45:08] when he's sitting there and persecuting
[45:10] Christians and he looks and he said
[45:12] there is something to this cross how do
[45:14] I get to work how do I get to where
[45:16] Jesus was and it was by his faith and he
[45:19] begins to preach and give this back out
[45:21] to the to the Romans so it's really an
[45:23] amazing thing as Luther begins to read
[45:25] this Luther said he said day and night I
[45:29] pondered it until I grasped the truth
[45:31] that the righteousness of God is the
[45:34] righteousness whereby through Grace and
[45:36] sheer Mercy he justifies Us by faith
[45:40] he says therefore I felt myself to be
[45:42] reborn that I have gone through open
[45:43] doors
[45:45] aren't you thankful that the veil was
[45:47] rent and now there's an open door that
[45:50] we can step into just like just like he
[45:52] did as he began to look at this and he
[45:55] he steps right through that open door
[45:56] and says now I'm in a paradise I'm in a
[45:58] place that I know who God is just by
[46:01] reading the one scripture in Romans 1
[46:03] 17.
[46:05] goes on down through here we'll look at
[46:07] this in in May of 1738 there was a
[46:10] failed minister
[46:12] a failed Minister and a missionary and
[46:15] he went to said he reluctantly went to a
[46:18] small Bible study and someone began to
[46:20] read Martin Luther's commentary kind of
[46:23] rehearsing exactly kind of what I just
[46:25] told you and here this failed missionary
[46:28] sits there and he says to us he says
[46:30] later he says while he was describing
[46:32] the change which God works in the heart
[46:35] through faith in Christ I felt my heart
[46:38] strangely warmed
[46:41] he said I felt that I did trust in
[46:43] Christ and Christ alone for my salvation
[46:45] and an assurance was given to me that he
[46:49] had taken away my sins even mine he says
[46:53] that was John Wesley
[46:56] John Wesley had to come to a place just
[46:58] like all Christians have to at some
[47:00] point in time you have to come to that
[47:02] place that you say by Faith by his Mercy
[47:05] by his grace my sins are taken away even
[47:07] mine as wicked as mean as rebellious as
[47:12] honorary as we are as human beings come
[47:16] on Church
[47:17] it's by this right here it's just by
[47:20] faith that we can go before Calvary
[47:25] we look at this here and uh going back
[47:28] into the book of Romans here in the
[47:29] first chapter I'm going to break down
[47:30] just a few of the scriptures here and
[47:32] and because Paul it's an amazing I mean
[47:35] I think uh as I'm digging into this I've
[47:37] been reading it and getting on these
[47:39] commentaries on this and it's it's
[47:40] really astonishing of what Paul is doing
[47:42] here but he says in verse 7 he says to
[47:45] all that being wrong beloved of God
[47:47] Called to be Saints and that stood out
[47:50] there because these Believers it says
[47:52] were called to be Saints
[47:56] they were not Saints
[48:00] did you hear what it says they were
[48:03] called to be Saints Paul didn't go
[48:05] preaching to a bunch of righteous holy
[48:07] people
[48:09] none of us come to church righteous and
[48:11] holy but by God before the foundation of
[48:15] the world
[48:16] and the Lamb's Book of Life he says I
[48:19] called you to be brought
[48:21] so right here the very scripture here is
[48:24] leading us to have our to build our
[48:25] faith as Paul looks at this and he says
[48:28] they were called to be Saints he says
[48:31] first I want to thank my God through
[48:33] Jesus Christ for all of you that your
[48:36] faith is spoken of throughout the whole
[48:38] world
[48:40] can we say that this morning
[48:42] can we say that our faith has been
[48:44] spoken of throughout the whole world
[48:47] what do people say about us in our
[48:49] communities how is our faith speaking
[48:51] before us
[48:53] that's something for us to think about
[48:54] there because these Romans
[48:56] who who was not founded upon a a
[48:59] Christian believer didn't come in there
[49:01] and found it it was a group of Believers
[49:03] on the day of Pentecost that Saul they
[49:05] saw what was happening they went and
[49:06] founded the church but now their faith
[49:09] has been known and spoken of around the
[49:11] whole world
[49:13] so where does our faith speak for us
[49:15] this morning
[49:16] think about that verse 15.
[49:19] so as much as in me I am ready to preach
[49:23] the gospel to you that are in Rome also
[49:26] Paul was ready
[49:28] he was ready to take a stand he was
[49:30] ready to spread the word now think about
[49:33] all he'd been through this is after he'd
[49:34] been preaching for they think like I
[49:36] said 20 years
[49:37] think about the persecutions he had been
[49:39] through
[49:40] but yet he comes before these Romans and
[49:42] he's put in the back of his mind no
[49:43] matter what I've been through no matter
[49:45] the valleys no matter the mountains no
[49:47] matter the rivers I've had to cross
[49:50] no matter the hardships I've had to face
[49:52] I'm here and I'm ready to preach the
[49:54] gospel
[49:55] are we ready to spread the gospel this
[49:57] morning the good news of Jesus Christ
[49:58] because that's what the scripture is
[50:00] telling us it's given us encouragement
[50:02] to preach the gospel for I am not
[50:05] ashamed of the Gospel
[50:07] we have to be careful with that one
[50:10] because we find ourselves in tight
[50:11] situations sometime and and before you
[50:13] know it maybe you're just not quite
[50:15] ready to step out there and speak
[50:17] exactly what you want to say you may be
[50:20] just a little bit standoffish I found
[50:22] myself in those places that I'm not
[50:23] comfortable sometimes spreading or
[50:25] saying exactly what I feel and what I
[50:27] should say
[50:29] I'll give you an example just comes to
[50:31] mind last week Joe's had to go to the to
[50:34] my work with me they'd never seen her
[50:37] some of them hadn't so if she goes in
[50:39] there we take care of business and I
[50:40] come back the next day and this woman
[50:42] says hey hey hey come here come here I
[50:44] gotta ask you something
[50:46] it's personal
[50:47] oh boy
[50:50] are y'all Pentecostal
[50:53] what's all of our answers sometimes most
[50:55] of our answers we're non-denominational
[50:58] we follow the scripture and that's about
[51:01] where we leave it that's where I left it
[51:02] and I thought you know maybe I should
[51:03] have went a little bit deeper into what
[51:05] I really do believe and then we'll see
[51:07] what my work really thinks about me
[51:09] what they really believe about me
[51:12] and she said well I just wondered
[51:14] because I saw how your your wife was
[51:15] dressed
[51:16] so there's your witness going before the
[51:18] world there's your faith and your
[51:20] witness and your testimony
[51:22] going before the world but I just
[51:24] thought you know that that we have to
[51:26] have that boldness that we're not
[51:27] ashamed
[51:30] everywhere Paul went he wasn't ashamed
[51:32] whether it meant prison whether it meant
[51:34] beating whether it meant scourging
[51:36] whatever it was he was not ashamed for
[51:39] it is the power of God unto salvation to
[51:42] everyone that believeth to the Jew first
[51:45] also to the Greek that and then we'll
[51:48] finish with the just shall live by faith
[51:49] the prophet
[51:51] I said I was looked this up and he says
[51:54] talking about the just shall live by
[51:56] faith he said we should be unfolding
[51:58] he said God
[52:00] 's Spirit pouring out not just one
[52:04] little gusher not just one little
[52:05] baptism but baptism after baptism not a
[52:08] revelation of just shall live by faith
[52:10] alone or sanctification or even the
[52:12] gifts of the Spirit he said but
[52:14] revelation after Revelation power after
[52:17] power glory after Glory he said that's
[52:20] the way we ought to be on our road ready
[52:22] for the translation he said but we not
[52:25] careful he said we linger around we back
[52:27] down to the old things and say well we
[52:30] just keep going back he said no let's go
[52:32] go forward
[52:34] so as he's looking at this scripture
[52:36] he's a he's talking about the great
[52:37] things that Paul is talking about and
[52:39] the things that that Luther saw and the
[52:41] things that John Wesley
[52:43] saw
[52:44] oh and he said but for us we're a step
[52:47] further than that now we've gone beyond
[52:49] where that was at but now we the bride
[52:52] of Jesus Christ have been not seeing
[52:54] ourselves a little bit farther we're
[52:55] even farther than just having the gifts
[52:57] of the spirits we need the Justice I
[52:59] live by faith we need sanctification we
[53:01] need clean lives we need clean living
[53:03] we need those things in our life but
[53:05] it's more than the gifts it's more than
[53:07] clean living
[53:08] it's moving on forward with God
[53:12] so as we look at that this morning let
[53:14] that be our thoughts as we think and and
[53:16] uh if you read into the book of Romans
[53:18] and you start digging into that I hope
[53:19] you enjoy I think you'll find that
[53:21] there's a lot of good information in the
[53:23] Book of Romans so God bless you Brother

[1:27:16] couldn't get away from that amen amen
[1:27:19] and so we want to go here you know take
[1:27:21] a little flame thought kind of and go in
[1:27:23] a little bit different direction but
[1:27:25] amen if you will turn your Bibles we'll
[1:27:28] go to the book of Ephesians amen and we
[1:27:31] want to read a scripture of course uh
[1:27:33] that we picked up off of the thought of
[1:27:36] him who let us we let until he be taken
[1:27:39] out of the way talking about the power
[1:27:41] of God and how that he is in Supreme
[1:27:44] control amen amen there is nothing that
[1:27:47] hasn't been put under his feet isn't
[1:27:50] that right nothing that hasn't been put
[1:27:52] under feet there's nothing that he
[1:27:54] didn't conquer
[1:27:55] praise be to God Amen and this morning
[1:27:58] it'll be kind of a challenge to us with
[1:27:59] the help of the Lord Ephesians 1 and
[1:28:02] we'll begin with verse 20.
[1:28:07] which he wrought in Christ when he
[1:28:09] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:28:12] his own right hand in Heavenly places
[1:28:16] far above amen I like that word far
[1:28:19] don't you
[1:28:20] far above all principality amen and
[1:28:25] power
[1:28:27] and might wow it's just talking about
[1:28:30] power and might in that right and
[1:28:32] Dominion any Authority whatsoever
[1:28:35] amen and every name that is named not
[1:28:39] only in this world but also in that
[1:28:41] which is to come
[1:28:42] and have put all things under his feet
[1:28:46] and gave him to be the head over all
[1:28:49] things to the church amen which is his
[1:28:53] body the fullness of him that filleth
[1:28:54] all in all may God add His blessings
[1:28:57] through reading your words you can be
[1:28:58] seated
[1:29:00] amen now I want to talk a little bit
[1:29:02] with the help of the Lord and and look
[1:29:04] at this from Paul's perspective
[1:29:07] because Paul had uh he's the one that
[1:29:11] mentions that here in Ephesians again he
[1:29:13] mentions and in the Colossians amen and
[1:29:16] then we go back over into the book of
[1:29:18] Hebrews with the help of the Lord and
[1:29:20] and see what he has there but in
[1:29:22] Ephesians again he mentions
[1:29:25] in chapter 4
[1:29:27] verse 11 and unto every one of us is
[1:29:30] given Grace according to the measure of
[1:29:33] the gift of Christ
[1:29:35] wherefore he saith when he ascended upon
[1:29:39] High amen notice Paul picking it up
[1:29:42] again talking about what happened when
[1:29:45] Christ descended upon High
[1:29:47] amen he says he led captivity captive
[1:29:53] amen praise the Lord let me know if
[1:29:56] something really happened something
[1:29:58] really happened today that Christ rose
[1:30:01] from the dead and when he ascended oh my
[1:30:05] and he gave gifts unto men
[1:30:08] isn't that right he gave gifts unto man
[1:30:10] down in verse 11 it says
[1:30:13] um well maybe we'll read verse 10 and he
[1:30:16] had in he had Ascent descended it's the
[1:30:18] same also that ascended far above all
[1:30:22] heavens
[1:30:23] amen how many knows there's different
[1:30:25] levels of Heaven
[1:30:26] sixth Dimension where the Saints are
[1:30:28] under the altar he goes up to the
[1:30:30] seventh heaven Paul talked about the
[1:30:32] seventh one I believe it was that he
[1:30:34] might feel all things
[1:30:37] amen and he gave some of course Apostles
[1:30:40] and Prophets and evangelists and pastors
[1:30:43] and teachers amen Psalms right there we
[1:30:46] see what what God gave back as gifts
[1:30:50] when he ascended on high
[1:30:52] so if a person is a pastor a teacher a
[1:30:56] prophet whatever it is I mean that
[1:30:58] person's just your brother he's no
[1:31:01] different than anybody else except that
[1:31:04] God has placed a gift in that man's life
[1:31:06] is that right amen and you either have
[1:31:09] that gift or you don't have that gift
[1:31:11] amen it's something that's divinely
[1:31:13] given brother bam taught the gifts and
[1:31:15] rep and uh callings are without
[1:31:18] repentance the Bible says amen and so
[1:31:22] it's placed there from your birth praise
[1:31:24] be to God
[1:31:25] amen and so even this morning truly if
[1:31:28] I'm a pastor go called of God then
[1:31:30] that's something that you're uh feeding
[1:31:33] on that's something that is a blessing
[1:31:35] from God
[1:31:39] amen who knows that
[1:31:41] teachers are blessing from God
[1:31:44] evangelists are blessing from God
[1:31:46] prophets are a blessing from God where
[1:31:48] would we be without the fivefold
[1:31:50] ministry this morning
[1:31:52] amen everybody just kind of do their own
[1:31:55] thing I guess you know
[1:31:56] but it's what now notice what it's for
[1:31:59] for one thing it says it's for the
[1:32:01] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:32:04] the ministry for the edifying edifying
[1:32:07] of the body of Christ till we all come
[1:32:08] in the unity of the faith and of the
[1:32:11] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:32:13] perfect man
[1:32:16] amen little big word for us human beings
[1:32:19] but it's there amen I believe it don't
[1:32:22] you unto the measure of the stature of
[1:32:24] the fullness of Christ now notice I like
[1:32:27] this and I want to just pick this up
[1:32:29] because this fight for Ministry and this
[1:32:30] what God gave was that we henceforth be
[1:32:35] no more children
[1:32:37] tossed to and through praise be to God
[1:32:42] and carried about with every wind of
[1:32:44] Doctrine by this light of men and the
[1:32:46] cunning crafting is why but whereby they
[1:32:48] lie and wait to deceive now notice how
[1:32:51] many know that anybody that's a
[1:32:53] Christian anytime there's a gospel
[1:32:55] priest it was the Colossians the
[1:32:57] Ephesians it don't matter what it was
[1:32:59] amen there would always be trying to
[1:33:02] amen the same as it is in African
[1:33:04] different places from what I understand
[1:33:06] that where the message has gone forth
[1:33:08] there's always false doctrines and
[1:33:10] always fall things that are trying to
[1:33:12] get in to rob you of the real blessing
[1:33:15] that's yours here he talks about that we
[1:33:18] don't be tossed to and fro because
[1:33:20] there's going to be an attempt at
[1:33:22] Deception for you the devil's going to
[1:33:24] attempt to deceive you with not
[1:33:27] something uh uh just out there in sinful
[1:33:29] world but something that is a Doctrine
[1:33:31] that's false
[1:33:33] false Doctrine and so forth and I
[1:33:35] remember when I first come in and this
[1:33:38] is kind of off the line of but perhaps
[1:33:40] just what the Lord wants but amen when I
[1:33:42] first come in a message and brother John
[1:33:44] steaming and even beginning to build the
[1:33:46] church we had just a few people there
[1:33:48] and and just and small but you know we
[1:33:51] had maybe then a few more families
[1:33:53] coming it wasn't no time until some of
[1:33:54] those folks that came in some of those
[1:33:56] good families seeming like God all
[1:33:58] caught up in false Doctrine
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:03] and so you know it goes around the
[1:34:05] devil's just always there to try to
[1:34:07] knock you out of the real solid thing
[1:34:09] but notice how it says that a real
[1:34:11] five-fold Ministry is not going to go
[1:34:13] off somewhere but it's going to keep you
[1:34:14] from being tossed to and fro
[1:34:18] makes them solid edifying in the body of
[1:34:20] Christ
[1:34:21] amen so now this is like I said this is
[1:34:23] not really what I want to go but I
[1:34:25] thought that was good how did he let
[1:34:27] captivity captives and that really
[1:34:30] caught my mind whenever the Lord kind of
[1:34:32] brought me that you know what are you
[1:34:33] giving up there
[1:34:34] he took captive and that doesn't really
[1:34:37] need any explaining everybody knows that
[1:34:39] that which you were kept captive by he
[1:34:42] put it in jail
[1:34:44] aren't you glad for that that he put
[1:34:46] yeah put it in jail the thing that kept
[1:34:48] you bound he bound it
[1:34:53] oh my
[1:34:55] God that's right where you used to have
[1:34:57] no joy right not the devil tries to come
[1:35:01] and steal you if you ever do it but as
[1:35:02] long as you keep him out he can't come
[1:35:04] in
[1:35:05] he can't never rob you again because
[1:35:07] you've got him in the place you want him
[1:35:10] amen I like that
[1:35:12] now over in Colossians we'll get to our
[1:35:15] thought here in a minute over in
[1:35:16] Colossians again I was reading a chapter
[1:35:18] the other day amen because how many
[1:35:21] believes that we ought to read every day
[1:35:24] and I you know yeah I believe in not me
[1:35:27] but bam says maybe read a chapter or two
[1:35:28] but I believe that was a book or two
[1:35:30] don't hurt
[1:35:32] amen and so you know whether I'm in the
[1:35:34] stand perhaps somewhere you know I just
[1:35:37] like to read amen and and so I read the
[1:35:40] whole book of Colossians and as I was
[1:35:42] reading down through here I'll pick some
[1:35:43] things up that I thought went really
[1:35:45] long with what uh ministering Wednesday
[1:35:47] and where I kind of got my thought of
[1:35:49] going further a little bit in part two
[1:35:51] perhaps
[1:35:52] but uh and also in uh well I won't get
[1:35:56] into that but in the other Bible that I
[1:35:58] have which is I don't even know the name
[1:36:01] of it but it has an explanation of what
[1:36:04] this was sent to the Colossians 4 the
[1:36:07] intent that it was and all of the
[1:36:08] different things the doctrines that they
[1:36:10] were having to deal with and so forth
[1:36:12] about Jesus not being Divine and all of
[1:36:14] that but anyway so Paul is trying to get
[1:36:17] across to them that Jesus Christ was the
[1:36:20] fullness of God Amen and now notice in
[1:36:23] in verse 9 of chapter 2 it says for in
[1:36:26] him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead
[1:36:29] bodily and ye are complete in him
[1:36:34] amen ye are complete in him which is the
[1:36:37] head of all principality and Power
[1:36:46] you know as I was studying there's
[1:36:48] another scripture that came to me about
[1:36:50] you know that Christ has is above every
[1:36:53] principality and every Power
[1:36:56] Jesus on his last uh when he came to the
[1:37:00] 11 in verse 16 of Matthew 28 and then he
[1:37:04] uh then the 11 disciples went away into
[1:37:06] Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had
[1:37:08] appointed them and when he saw them they
[1:37:10] worshiped him but some doubted and Jesus
[1:37:14] spake and said unto them saying now
[1:37:17] notice
[1:37:18] notice what Jesus says to them after not
[1:37:21] having been absent from them right now
[1:37:24] he says all power
[1:37:26] is given unto me in heaven and earth
[1:37:33] praise be to God aren't you glad aren't
[1:37:36] you glad that all power he has all power
[1:37:38] he's not a power but what is his
[1:37:42] given unto him in heaven and in Earth
[1:37:44] that's another place to dispute the two
[1:37:47] different gods if there's another God
[1:37:49] somewhere we ain't got no power because
[1:37:50] Jesus said he had all the power
[1:37:53] amen all power is given unto me in
[1:37:56] heaven and earth and then he says go
[1:37:57] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:37:59] isn't that right amen so he wanted to
[1:38:01] know that beyond the power of God was
[1:38:04] going to be behind them
[1:38:05] amen
[1:38:07] now notice back to Ephesians I mean
[1:38:09] Colossians next in Colossians if you
[1:38:11] want to try to follow me I can wait on
[1:38:12] you but you know Colossians 2
[1:38:15] amen now we just read Mercy Lavin or
[1:38:18] yeah verse 11.
[1:38:23] for he is the head of all principality
[1:38:25] and power and then he goes on talking
[1:38:27] about just you being dead in your sins
[1:38:29] and so forth and how did he blood it out
[1:38:32] the hand writing of ordinances verse 14
[1:38:34] that was against us which was contrary
[1:38:37] to us and took it all out of the way
[1:38:39] nailing it to the cross
[1:38:41] and having spoiled I like this word
[1:38:45] spoiled I mean how many believe that
[1:38:48] Jesus was a spoiler
[1:38:51] of the devil's little party
[1:38:54] he did absolutely spoiled everything the
[1:38:57] devil had
[1:38:58] when he went to Calvary instead of uh
[1:39:01] taking it you know without a Calvary
[1:39:03] when he when he went there he spoiled
[1:39:05] all the devils
[1:39:07] stripped him of everything he had any
[1:39:09] kind of Rights on
[1:39:12] and then
[1:39:13] we're doing now I think Ramsey we talked
[1:39:15] about we're dealing with it powerless
[1:39:17] enemy it defeated enemy is what we're
[1:39:20] dealing with
[1:39:23] so he says in having spoiled
[1:39:26] principalities and Powers
[1:39:30] he made a show of them openly
[1:39:34] triumphing over them in it
[1:39:37] made me think of that song oh are you in
[1:39:40] the church triumphant
[1:39:46] yo quiet
[1:39:48] are you in the church try out for
[1:39:51] triumphant means Victorious
[1:39:54] are you in the savior's bride if you're
[1:39:58] not then come and be baptized into the
[1:40:00] body and forevermore abide
[1:40:04] I'm glad this morning to be in the
[1:40:06] church triumphant
[1:40:09] amen it isn't necessarily a local body
[1:40:11] but it's those who have been baptized
[1:40:14] into Jesus Christ's Spirit they're in
[1:40:17] the church triumphant they're Victorious
[1:40:20] they're the kind of people that don't
[1:40:22] have to have Victory a little bit of
[1:40:24] angry they have complete Victory cause
[1:40:26] what Jesus does anything he does a
[1:40:29] thorough job he does the perfect job
[1:40:32] and when God comes and doesn't work in
[1:40:34] you he does the perfect work
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:40] praise be to God aren't you glad
[1:40:43] Hallelujah so I found that there and I
[1:40:46] found from Paul talking again about
[1:40:48] Christ coming and spoiling
[1:40:50] principalities and triumphing it over
[1:40:53] them
[1:40:53] Hallelujah he was talking about the law
[1:40:56] did people judging you in meter and
[1:40:59] drinking that has a little bit to do
[1:41:00] with what they were dealing with and so
[1:41:02] forth he needed to just clear all of
[1:41:04] that up don't let nobody judge you in a
[1:41:06] holiday or new day or or Sabbath days
[1:41:09] which is your shadow of things to come
[1:41:11] and so forth
[1:41:12] amen and I went down to verse chapter
[1:41:15] three is where I want to get my message
[1:41:17] she says that if he then Paul says if ye
[1:41:21] then be risen with Christ
[1:41:26] Hallelujah now when we skip the whole
[1:41:29] lot we skipped a whole lot when he
[1:41:31] talked about you are dead you were dead
[1:41:34] in your sins and trespasses you had the
[1:41:36] quickened I mean you you've risen with
[1:41:39] him
[1:41:40] even he says if you've died with Christ
[1:41:42] and you Rose it with Christ
[1:41:45] tonight
[1:41:49] amen not quite after 12 so it's still
[1:41:51] morning
[1:41:52] but we're in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:41:54] Jesus amen
[1:41:56] amen and now if you are risen with
[1:41:59] Christ seek no things which are above
[1:42:03] Hallelujah
[1:42:05] come on think about it now he explains
[1:42:07] what we're to seek up there amen we're
[1:42:10] to seek something up there
[1:42:13] what are we gonna what are we supposed
[1:42:15] to seek up there
[1:42:17] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:42:21] of God
[1:42:22] in other words Paul's telling us to look
[1:42:24] up now
[1:42:26] look up a little bit where Jesus
[1:42:29] ascended on high let captivity captive
[1:42:32] spoil every principality and he's about
[1:42:34] the Bible says he's above the heavens of
[1:42:36] Heavens now
[1:42:40] he's way out there
[1:42:42] praise be to God
[1:42:50] he's up of all the dimensions there are
[1:42:55] he's above every dimension
[1:42:57] he's in the highest
[1:42:59] dimension
[1:43:00] amen
[1:43:02] there's hell there's the reasons that
[1:43:04] are lost there's the regions of the
[1:43:05] saved and that's then there's up there
[1:43:07] where he is
[1:43:09] above every Dimension that is he is
[1:43:12] oh he is in the highest Dimension praise
[1:43:15] be to God
[1:43:16] this morning we want to look at what
[1:43:18] he's doing up there
[1:43:19] amen Paul said look above
[1:43:23] and also and I've named this
[1:43:32] seek those things verse 2. it's set your
[1:43:36] affections on things above not on things
[1:43:39] on the earth setting our affection
[1:43:44] huh that okay let's talk about setting
[1:43:48] our affection because you know I know
[1:43:50] that that's where the problem leads
[1:43:53] it's not with God it's where people's
[1:43:56] affection is
[1:43:58] it's where they love it it's where the
[1:44:01] exposure it it's what they desire or
[1:44:05] don't desire is where the problem is
[1:44:10] amen I thought of our thought this
[1:44:12] morning look every one of us is here
[1:44:14] because your effect affection is right
[1:44:17] your affection wants to be in church
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:21] that's why we sit here
[1:44:23] because this is where our affection he
[1:44:25] says let your affection now we know for
[1:44:27] affection and conscience and memory and
[1:44:29] reasoning is one of the five five uh
[1:44:33] um
[1:44:34] five feelings not feelings what do you
[1:44:36] call it
[1:44:37] huh
[1:44:39] said Thank You census one of the five
[1:44:41] senses of not the body but of the spirit
[1:44:45] see taste feel hear and smell but my
[1:44:47] faction causing that something in the
[1:44:49] spirit realm and that's where the
[1:44:51] problem is is what the spirit realm of
[1:44:54] people
[1:44:55] amen
[1:44:58] oh my so now let's look at what Paul's
[1:45:01] talking about here for a minute
[1:45:03] but Paul's talking about how that we're
[1:45:05] supposed to look
[1:45:07] up seek those things which are above
[1:45:10] where he is sitting at the right hand of
[1:45:13] God
[1:45:14] turn with me to the book of Hebrews
[1:45:20] and Hebrews 3
[1:45:22] Hebrews 3 and 1.
[1:45:24] I'm just about going to have to
[1:45:27] try that
[1:45:29] mark off some of these so I can keep
[1:45:31] this straight Hebrews 3 and 1 says
[1:45:34] wherefore holy Brethren
[1:45:36] partakers of the Heavenly calling
[1:45:40] considered the Apostle and high priest
[1:45:43] of our profession Jesus Christ
[1:45:46] how many knows in the book of Hebrews
[1:45:48] Paul talked a lot about thou Christ and
[1:45:51] his high priest position
[1:45:54] how did he is our high preached isn't
[1:45:57] that right how many knows he is our high
[1:45:59] priest he has now notice who is faithful
[1:46:03] to him that appointed him as also Moses
[1:46:06] was faithful in all at his house
[1:46:09] for this man was counted worthy of more
[1:46:11] Glory than Moses in so much as he who
[1:46:13] has builted the house have more honor
[1:46:16] than the house
[1:46:18] amen
[1:46:21] says this for every house is filled up
[1:46:23] by some man but he had built all things
[1:46:25] as God is God and Moses barely who is
[1:46:28] faithful in all of his house was as his
[1:46:30] servant for a testimony of those things
[1:46:32] which were before spoken after
[1:46:34] but Christ as a son over his house
[1:46:38] whose house are are you with me we
[1:46:43] now may believe that we are his house
[1:46:47] and Moses was faithful in what he did
[1:46:49] and he's saying that Jesus as this high
[1:46:51] priest he's faithful in his house
[1:46:55] amen
[1:46:57] whose house are we if we hope faster for
[1:46:59] confidence and the rejoicing firm unto
[1:47:03] the end
[1:47:04] let's go over to chapter four
[1:47:08] chapter 4 and verse 14. notice here he
[1:47:11] says seeing then that we have a high
[1:47:14] priest
[1:47:15] that is passed into the heavens
[1:47:19] policy he was a Jew and he he knew what
[1:47:22] all of key Ephesus and he knew the order
[1:47:24] of high priests and all of the church
[1:47:27] and all of the way that it was supposed
[1:47:28] to be he knew that we don't have it here
[1:47:30] now but he knew what it was the holies
[1:47:32] of holies was and how that you couldn't
[1:47:34] go into that and the holies of holies
[1:47:36] unless you as a priest and levite and
[1:47:38] unless you were dressed just tried all
[1:47:40] of these things so Paul was very
[1:47:43] familiar with
[1:47:45] the priesthood and he takes boats of
[1:47:47] Hebrews and he talks about this
[1:47:49] priesthood he brings in Melchizedek now
[1:47:51] that Christ was a a priest after the
[1:47:54] order of Melchizedek and so forth which
[1:47:56] we'll get into
[1:47:57] but he says we have a great High peace
[1:47:59] that is passed into the heavens Jesus
[1:48:01] Christ the son of God he says seeing
[1:48:04] them not did he say see go things out
[1:48:07] from above so here it says seeing then
[1:48:10] that we have this great high priest that
[1:48:11] passed into the heavens as Jesus the son
[1:48:13] of God let us hope fast our profession
[1:48:17] [Music]
[1:48:18] our brother bam said our confession I
[1:48:21] mean those he said one place he says
[1:48:23] he's the high priest of your confession
[1:48:26] so you before you get anything from God
[1:48:29] you have to confess that it's yours that
[1:48:32] you believe in it that he purchased it
[1:48:34] for you
[1:48:35] he's the eye please of your profession
[1:48:38] amen
[1:48:40] for we have not and high priests which
[1:48:42] cannot be touched with the feeling huh
[1:48:46] of our infirmities
[1:48:48] but was in all points tempted like as we
[1:48:51] are yet without sin
[1:48:54] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[1:48:57] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[1:48:59] and find Grace to help in time of me
[1:49:05] think about it when I got into thinking
[1:49:07] about this how that how that Jesus
[1:49:09] Christ Humanity ascended up on high he's
[1:49:12] there making intercessions for you and I
[1:49:15] that's what he's doing up there and he's
[1:49:17] a perfect high priest
[1:49:19] he's not like the high priest that Paul
[1:49:21] had to deal with
[1:49:23] that he talked about over even anywhere
[1:49:26] over in the Old Testament because Paul
[1:49:28] explains a little bit uh the difference
[1:49:30] between Jesus and the high priest that
[1:49:33] they had to deal with
[1:49:35] he says uh in chapter 7 verse 23 and
[1:49:39] they truly were many priests because
[1:49:41] they were not suffered
[1:49:44] because they were not suffered to
[1:49:46] continue by reason of death in other
[1:49:48] words he now realized that all the other
[1:49:50] priests they you know they couldn't
[1:49:52] always fulfill the desires of that
[1:49:55] people would have perhaps perhaps you'd
[1:49:56] want to see the priest today oh he seek
[1:49:59] the name
[1:50:00] huh or he died yesterday and it'll be a
[1:50:04] few days before we get another one
[1:50:07] but this man because he continues ever
[1:50:10] has an unchangeable priesthood in other
[1:50:13] words it doesn't have to be changed for
[1:50:15] two thousand years
[1:50:17] amen wherefore he is Abel also to save
[1:50:22] them to the other most that come unto
[1:50:25] God by him seeing that he ever liveth to
[1:50:29] make an intercession for us
[1:50:32] I like that how many know you ain't
[1:50:34] never worried you ain't never got to be
[1:50:36] worried about not getting up being able
[1:50:38] to get a hold of your high priest
[1:50:40] the one that intercedes for you the one
[1:50:43] that you prayed to that's why prayer is
[1:50:45] so powerful is because you've got a
[1:50:47] powerful high priest you've got a
[1:50:50] powerful person that's right there and
[1:50:52] that's why the public God could say you
[1:50:53] know whenever the weakness Christian
[1:50:55] gets on his knees and said God forgive
[1:50:57] me of my sins and failures that we might
[1:51:00] be weak but if you get on your knees the
[1:51:02] devil traveled cause he knows that
[1:51:03] you've got a high priest
[1:51:06] they don't get old he don't he don't
[1:51:08] never he's never out of time he's never
[1:51:10] home he's never away from home
[1:51:13] he's always there not just during the
[1:51:15] day but day and night he's there for you
[1:51:18] interceding for you
[1:51:21] for anything that you have made up
[1:51:23] because he's come overcome sickness he's
[1:51:25] overcome fear he's overcome depression
[1:51:27] he's come overcome sorrow he's gonna
[1:51:30] overcome everything like that and I have
[1:51:32] that says sometimes if we've got a high
[1:51:34] face like that why are we still like we
[1:51:37] are why are we not exactly what we're
[1:51:39] supposed to be when we've got a perfect
[1:51:42] high priest
[1:51:44] foreign
[1:51:47] [Applause]
[1:51:56] given to us by Jesus Christ when he's
[1:51:59] there he's up there in a perfect place
[1:52:03] a perfect high priest
[1:52:05] there to make intercession for you
[1:52:08] as he said
[1:52:11] he is able to save them to the uttermost
[1:52:16] he can completely save you he can
[1:52:19] completely deliver you
[1:52:21] he can completely fill you he can give
[1:52:24] you joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:52:27] amen whatever you
[1:52:32] need of he's done to make it good he's
[1:52:35] there to make every word every promise
[1:52:37] that he ever made good for you
[1:52:39] [Applause]
[1:52:41] he's sitting on high
[1:52:43] this morning
[1:52:45] and we know under the breach Hunter
[1:52:48] program says when he leaves that
[1:52:49] intercessory box
[1:52:51] when he has no intercessor anymore you
[1:52:54] can pray all you want to
[1:52:56] let me tell you there'll be people
[1:52:58] falling on their knees they'll be
[1:52:59] following at the altar in the
[1:53:00] tribulation period after he who let us
[1:53:03] will let until the Holy Ghost is taken
[1:53:04] out of the way when the Holy Ghost is
[1:53:06] God there is no more mercy no matter how
[1:53:08] much they cry
[1:53:10] even brother Brown said they'll come to
[1:53:12] the Altar and see that they're getting
[1:53:14] saved when they're not
[1:53:16] you tell them you talk about this
[1:53:18] evening
[1:53:22] we're no unknown part of that
[1:53:24] no no no no we want to take advantage
[1:53:26] now God take care of my problems now
[1:53:29] Lord get me ready Lord
[1:53:32] amen
[1:53:35] oh my
[1:53:39] for such a
[1:53:41] verse 26 for such an high priest became
[1:53:44] us
[1:53:45] who is Holy
[1:53:47] blameless or harmless
[1:53:49] undefiled separate from Sinners and made
[1:53:52] in high priests
[1:53:54] no and made higher then the heavens
[1:53:58] amen higher than the heavens
[1:54:02] look up that way Paul says
[1:54:04] who needeth not daily
[1:54:07] as those High priests who offer up
[1:54:10] sacrifice first for his own sins
[1:54:13] huh and then from the peoples for this
[1:54:16] he did once when he offered up himself I
[1:54:19] may believe that that was a perfect and
[1:54:22] complete offering when he offered
[1:54:24] himself what is that now you can kill
[1:54:26] all the goats and Jeep you want it'll
[1:54:28] never do you any good anymore
[1:54:30] why because he gave his son he gave his
[1:54:33] blood for us
[1:54:35] he paid the price
[1:54:37] and now he's not one that needed daily
[1:54:40] or to keep making them and so forth
[1:54:43] for the law maketh men High priests
[1:54:45] which have infirmity amen
[1:54:49] amen he made High priests out of those
[1:54:51] who have infirmity but let me tell you
[1:54:52] he has no infirmity this morning
[1:54:55] aren't you glad for that
[1:54:57] praise be to God
[1:55:01] he doesn't have any need
[1:55:04] it's a perfect high priest
[1:55:08] so then why
[1:55:10] then why I ask myself
[1:55:12] why do we not possess the things that we
[1:55:14] should have
[1:55:16] do we not really trust this high priest
[1:55:20] do we not have an open Channel with this
[1:55:22] high priest
[1:55:24] amen
[1:55:26] how many believes it's important that we
[1:55:28] have a Clear Channel with this high
[1:55:29] priest when we pray and when we have
[1:55:31] things that he hears us
[1:55:34] it's important
[1:55:35] praise be to God it brought me to this
[1:55:39] question that is why
[1:55:42] what excuse do we have
[1:55:45] what is our excuse
[1:55:47] how about you realize today that the
[1:55:49] world not only do we
[1:55:51] should not have a dog you know give me
[1:55:54] an excuse we are good at giving
[1:55:56] ourselves excuses
[1:56:00] but we're done without excuse we don't
[1:56:01] have an excuse
[1:56:06] how many knows the Bible says and even
[1:56:08] brother Adam says you know when you
[1:56:09] become a Christian to send question is
[1:56:11] settled
[1:56:14] you don't believe anymore
[1:56:17] you don't have failures but the same
[1:56:19] question is settled
[1:56:20] if you see on sin and have a desire to
[1:56:23] send you need to get saved
[1:56:27] you need to get the Holy Ghost
[1:56:30] because God Christ overcomes sin
[1:56:35] just depends on where your desires are
[1:56:37] remember Jesus said he said you know the
[1:56:39] Kingdom of Heaven is like a man that
[1:56:41] made a marriage and so forth he invited
[1:56:43] everybody and he'd let everybody come oh
[1:56:46] I mean oh Jesus is welcome to everybody
[1:56:48] whosoever will let him come
[1:56:53] but they all began to make excuse
[1:56:58] amen well this well that amen
[1:57:03] praise the Lord
[1:57:04] let's turn
[1:57:07] over to
[1:57:09] Jeremiah
[1:57:11] let's start with Jeremiah
[1:57:13] I'm Gonna Change turned the corner for
[1:57:15] just a minute here if that's all right
[1:57:17] because remember
[1:57:19] Paul said that the problem is
[1:57:22] is that people's affections is in the
[1:57:24] wrong place
[1:57:25] set your affections on things above not
[1:57:29] on things below
[1:57:32] but so many times a lot of us
[1:57:35] our joy depends on
[1:57:37] Earthly things
[1:57:40] amen
[1:57:41] and we're not really looking our
[1:57:43] affection isn't where it ought to be
[1:57:46] well I hope this Ring's here and
[1:57:48] everywhere
[1:57:48] this morning I believe that every one of
[1:57:51] us need an affection check
[1:57:56] and affection check
[1:57:59] where is your affection
[1:58:03] in Jeremiah 8
[1:58:09] and verse
[1:58:12] 20. better Ben amused is what he
[1:58:15] preached on the message called why and I
[1:58:16] want to use a few quotes out of that
[1:58:19] so he says to harvest is passed summer
[1:58:21] is in but
[1:58:23] and we are not saved amen
[1:58:28] can we say God is supplied
[1:58:31] God is supplying evidence he's even
[1:58:34] taking his own picture God took his own
[1:58:36] picture
[1:58:38] with a man in this generation
[1:58:40] when another Baptist was up there and he
[1:58:43] was putting his finger he put his finger
[1:58:45] up there and writing about his face
[1:58:47] and said take a picture of that because
[1:58:49] I want to put that in the paper and I
[1:58:50] want to show everybody that I've told
[1:58:52] him
[1:58:53] huh
[1:58:54] took a bunch of pictures that's the only
[1:58:57] one they come off was God saying I'm
[1:59:00] with him
[1:59:04] God himself come down in the pillar of
[1:59:07] fire look what he did in this generation
[1:59:10] they are going to be without
[1:59:12] excuse
[1:59:16] why because their affection was in the
[1:59:18] wrong place
[1:59:19] amen
[1:59:23] the Harvest is past God has supplied
[1:59:25] what we need help need up he's the
[1:59:27] intercessor he's the perfect
[1:59:28] interception so why aren't more people
[1:59:31] saved

[2:03:54] he has put high priest up there for
[2:03:56] everybody whosoever will let him come
[2:03:59] he's at
[2:04:02] right even at the end of the book he

[2:04:16] that makes so that the whole world is
[2:04:19] without excuse

[2:04:26] well I didn't no you did
[2:04:28] everything was provided you that could
[2:04:31] be provided for you
[2:04:33] brother Branham after reading this
[2:04:35] scripture he says I want to kick this
[2:04:36] subject now I'm going to call it he says
[2:04:39] you know when God listen I want to call
[2:04:42] it why you know when God is so good to
[2:04:44] us to make a way of Escape of danger why
[2:04:48] do we not accept the way
[2:04:50] then God asks why I think he has the
[2:04:54] right to ask why amen
[2:04:56] he took that y out of there
[2:04:59] oh my why then
[2:05:02] is not the health of my daughter
[2:05:03] recovered why
[2:05:05] listen for he's went to all his trouble
[2:05:09] to make this way for our good and place
[2:05:13] it before us
[2:05:15] how many knows he went out of it he made
[2:05:17] sure that everything was right
[2:05:21] he made it all perfect all just right so
[2:05:24] that we could have a way of Escape
[2:05:26] then what are we gonna do amen
[2:05:30] listen
[2:05:32] that's the question
[2:05:35] and there's no better one has a better
[2:05:38] right to ask it than God
[2:05:41] if God makes a way of Escape for his
[2:05:43] people to escape that horrible thing or
[2:05:45] sickness or death or Eternal death
[2:05:48] I mean as he's been away for every
[2:05:50] everything
[2:05:51] he's made a way for you to live
[2:05:53] eternally
[2:05:55] and then the people fail to receive
[2:05:57] God's going to ask why now that's going
[2:06:00] to be a great thing on the day of
[2:06:01] judgment when God is going to ask
[2:06:03] tonight that's so simple here everybody
[2:06:05] that will not accept him as our savior
[2:06:08] and be filled with his Spirit why didn't
[2:06:10] you do it and we're going to have to
[2:06:13] give an accountant an answer for it just
[2:06:15] remember you're going to give an answer
[2:06:17] for every word that God has written
[2:06:20] why didn't you why and you'll have no
[2:06:24] excuse at that day
[2:06:27] you'll have no excuse on that day
[2:06:33] amen
[2:06:37] when there's no excuse It's inexcusable
[2:06:40] it's indefensible
[2:06:42] that people will be indefensible but
[2:06:44] they have no defense
[2:06:47] because God's going to say why didn't
[2:06:49] you
[2:06:49] after I made it perfect
[2:06:52] I send it on high give you everything
[2:06:54] that you have need of and yet you turn
[2:06:59] it down
[2:07:01] praise be to God
[2:07:04] remember in Second Kings
[2:07:07] Moab rebelled against Israel after the
[2:07:09] death of Ahab and
[2:07:11] fell through the lattice in the upper
[2:07:13] chamber and so forth Amen in Samaria he
[2:07:15] was sick and he sent Messengers and said
[2:07:17] unto them go and inquire of the god of
[2:07:20] Equinox the inquire of Beelzebub the god
[2:07:24] of equine whether I shall recover of the
[2:07:26] disease and the angel of the Lord said
[2:07:27] to Elijah the Tish by it rise go and
[2:07:29] meet The Messengers of the king of
[2:07:30] Samaria and say unto them is it not
[2:07:33] because there is not a God in Israel
[2:07:35] that you go to inquire bills above the
[2:07:37] god of equine and he said thus saith the
[2:07:39] law because you've done this you will
[2:07:41] not come off yet
[2:07:45] let me tell you something how many
[2:07:46] believes that in this generation God's
[2:07:48] saying wasn't there a prophet in the
[2:07:49] land and thy sin didn't I come down amen
[2:07:52] right beside them that man of God every
[2:07:55] time it discern the thoughts intent of
[2:07:57] the heart
[2:07:58] did what I did when it was all walking
[2:08:00] on the earth not three years but 30 or
[2:08:03] something years
[2:08:04] Time After Time
[2:08:07] and your dad desires and they wanted to
[2:08:09] be a church member they wanted their
[2:08:11] Pentecostal church and and speaking in
[2:08:13] tongues as being the evidence of the
[2:08:15] Holy Ghost
[2:08:20] didn't I send you a Vindicated Prophet
[2:08:22] then why huh
[2:08:24] do you want to have your own way why is
[2:08:26] your affection in the wrong place with
[2:08:28] your pride I mean it was the same way
[2:08:30] with the Pharisees their affection was
[2:08:32] on being proud and being a somebody
[2:08:35] rather than taking the Vindicated Jesus
[2:08:38] Christ in that hour
[2:08:39] oh my
[2:08:42] praise the Lord
[2:08:44] you love him
[2:08:46] listen to this let's find out why
[2:08:49] let's find out what's going on
[2:08:51] why do people turn
[2:08:54] to things that don't satisfy when God
[2:08:57] has given you
[2:08:58] what satisfies
[2:09:01] amen
[2:09:03] oh my
[2:09:07] foreign
[2:09:09] I say unto you Moses gave you not that
[2:09:12] bread from heaven but my father giveth
[2:09:14] you the true bread from Heaven this is
[2:09:15] in John 6 and verse 43. that's the day
[2:09:19] unto him Lord Evermore give us this
[2:09:21] bread and Jesus said unto them I am the
[2:09:24] bread of life he that cometh to me shall
[2:09:26] never hunger
[2:09:29] and he'll believeth on me shall never
[2:09:31] thirst
[2:09:33] amen
[2:09:44] never thirst and never hunger
[2:09:51] but I say unto you that he also
[2:09:55] have seen me and believe not
[2:09:57] all that the father gaveth me shall come
[2:09:59] to me in him that cometh to me I will in
[2:10:02] no wise cast out
[2:10:04] amen so let's pull back just a minute
[2:10:08] ah
[2:10:10] there was a girl on top
[2:10:14] am talked about how that she had gotten
[2:10:16] so old and she had never kissed a boy
[2:10:18] and never went to a party and never
[2:10:19] drank a beer and I don't know why she
[2:10:21] was a psychiatrist or whatever but this
[2:10:23] psychiatrist he sat down to talk to her
[2:10:26] and he says you mean you have never been
[2:10:27] kissed by a boy she said no not one time
[2:10:29] in all my life you mean you've never
[2:10:31] drank and then been at a party never
[2:10:32] it's a girl you don't know what you're
[2:10:34] missing
[2:10:35] now remember he was talking about having
[2:10:37] to go see her because she was trying to
[2:10:39] kill herself she was going to have to go
[2:10:42] into shock treatments and everything
[2:10:43] else parents couldn't even see her
[2:10:45] anymore it's really got in a pathetic
[2:10:48] condition because of one person that
[2:10:50] turned her mind
[2:10:51] amen
[2:10:55] all right listen it's because that she
[2:10:59] she lost her mind and this next week
[2:11:01] will go into the incubation for shock
[2:11:02] treatment it's because that she turned
[2:11:04] her thoughts from Christ on to what the
[2:11:06] fire psychiatrist was telling their mind
[2:11:08] he says that's what we are here for this
[2:11:10] morning is to move our mind move our
[2:11:12] thinking off the things of the world
[2:11:14] onto the things of God
[2:11:16] and to change our thought pattern from
[2:11:19] the things of the world onto the things
[2:11:20] of God you know and then he goes talking
[2:11:22] about life he was preaching how dare
[2:11:24] some of you who were so little there
[2:11:25] would be so little to try to quench that
[2:11:27] blessed Thirst by trying to satisfy it
[2:11:30] with drinking and smoking and television
[2:11:32] and running and carrying on and rumbling
[2:11:34] around and trying to satisfy that Godly
[2:11:36] thing that God put you in there to
[2:11:38] thirst for you're just polluting what
[2:11:40] God has placed in you to receive his
[2:11:42] spirit
[2:11:44] let me knows God is putting each and
[2:11:46] every human being he had to put
[2:11:48] something in there that we all love to
[2:11:50] have pleasure we all need satisfaction
[2:11:52] we all need love we all need care we
[2:11:54] need we need these things we all have
[2:11:57] been given affection and written
[2:11:58] emotions and so forth
[2:12:01] oh my
[2:12:03] he says it this way notice what makes
[2:12:06] you try to have a big time like that
[2:12:08] it's because God Made You
[2:12:10] and gave you a crave
[2:12:12] for life
[2:12:15] God Made You the makeup that your makeup
[2:12:17] there isn't a man and a woman on the
[2:12:19] Earth today never was a man or a woman
[2:12:21] Earth to Earth he says tonight
[2:12:24] or on Earth at any time but what had a
[2:12:26] craving for something a thirsting for
[2:12:29] pleasure got me that they're seeing you
[2:12:32] I mean every one of us every human being
[2:12:35] likes to have what I call perhaps fun
[2:12:38] we all like pleasure
[2:12:41] isn't that right God put that in there
[2:12:43] people that's that's why they're doing
[2:12:46] what they're doing they're going crazy
[2:12:47] because they never figure out how to
[2:12:49] satisfy that thirst
[2:12:52] that's why the world's gone like it is
[2:12:54] because they're going to what the god of
[2:12:56] beelzebuck
[2:12:58] they go to the devil to get these things
[2:13:00] satisfied
[2:13:02] instead of going to the high priest
[2:13:06] on the guard they go to the devil
[2:13:09] drinking and closing and adultery and
[2:13:11] butter Ram says men cheating on their
[2:13:13] wives wives cheating on their husbands
[2:13:14] they all do that because there's a
[2:13:16] thirst in there
[2:13:17] a lot of them thought they're getting
[2:13:19] married would take care of that that
[2:13:21] don't take care of that fairstone are
[2:13:22] there no marriage laws but no wife will
[2:13:24] ever satisfy that there's only one I
[2:13:28] action or not
[2:13:30] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost on your
[2:13:33] hearts the only thing that's satisfied
[2:13:36] the only thing that'll ever satisfy
[2:13:39] Hallelujah aren't you glad for that
[2:13:41] come to this video come to Christ
[2:13:44] he made it as he made all human beings
[2:13:46] that way he made Cain that way
[2:13:49] is that right Cain was that way he had
[2:13:51] to worship
[2:13:52] [Music]
[2:13:54] oh my
[2:13:56] God praise be to God
[2:13:58] so listen craving for something
[2:14:00] thirsting for pleasure God made you that
[2:14:02] way he made you that thirst so that you
[2:14:04] thirst out for him how dare you quench
[2:14:06] the Blessed holy thirst that God put in
[2:14:08] your heart to try to satisfy it with sin
[2:14:12] hot there you try to quench that Holy
[2:14:15] thirst for something by some vulgarity
[2:14:17] program instead of going to Church of
[2:14:19] the Living God
[2:14:25] there are affections people
[2:14:29] went out with a girl when he was young
[2:14:32] and she tried to get him to smoke a
[2:14:33] cigarette tried to get him to drink some
[2:14:35] beer trying to get him to go to a dance
[2:14:37] he said no I don't dance no I don't
[2:14:39] smoke and she says man you don't drink
[2:14:40] you don't smoke you know that's what do
[2:14:42] you do for fun what do you tell her
[2:14:45] go to church with me if you want to know
[2:14:49] the real believer's fun his pleasure is
[2:14:52] going to church
[2:14:53] [Applause]
[2:14:55] because he always believe we shall we
[2:14:57] dance we have a good time here
[2:15:00] if you're right with God if not you're
[2:15:02] gonna be out now
[2:15:05] you might be a little secret but man you
[2:15:08] need to get under a sicker once in a
[2:15:09] while
[2:15:10] calm the condemnation until you can get
[2:15:12] that under the blood and have some
[2:15:14] fellowship with the heavenly father
[2:15:15] you'll find out that the Holy Spirit and
[2:15:18] the relationship with Jesus Christ is
[2:15:20] better than hunting it's better than
[2:15:22] fishing it better than Pleasures it's
[2:15:24] better than drink is better than any
[2:15:25] drug you'll ever take
[2:15:28] [Music]
[2:15:29] Lord Jesus
[2:15:31] what's our excuse
[2:15:34] why haven't you got the baptism and all
[2:15:36] of you why aren't you the happiest
[2:15:38] person alive
[2:15:41] in the universe
[2:15:43] come get me going
[2:15:48] people into your number
[2:15:52] this morning you haven't talked to the
[2:15:54] high priest that perfect high priest
[2:15:55] enough you haven't looked the shot
[2:15:57] things that are from above
[2:15:59] but Christ sits on the right hand of God
[2:16:01] making his word good
[2:16:08] oh my
[2:16:12] God
[2:16:15] I'd like to tone it down a little just
[2:16:17] talk like some sophisticated
[2:16:20] dignified pastor
[2:16:24] amen what was it
[2:16:27] excuses excuses you hear them every day
[2:16:31] you go to church and music's either too
[2:16:33] loud or it's too quiet it's either too
[2:16:35] hot or it's too cold
[2:16:37] the preacher he's either too loud or
[2:16:39] she's too dignified
[2:16:42] huh
[2:16:43] you just can't please some people
[2:16:46] I mean you can't please a person that
[2:16:48] ain't filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:16:50] they're not pleasable
[2:16:54] why because they're not satisfiable
[2:16:56] because being satisfied and unsatisfied
[2:17:00] personally please
[2:17:01] foreign
[2:17:04] oh boy can I really Scorch it really
[2:17:07] really good and God hates a complainer
[2:17:10] God killed a bunch of Israelites for
[2:17:13] their murmuring and their complaining it
[2:17:15] says just get out of my face
[2:17:19] I'll wipe them off the map Moses and
[2:17:21] I'll bring up another generation
[2:17:24] why what is the original reason that God
[2:17:27] hates a murmurer
[2:17:32] because he had somebody in heaven
[2:17:35] that was a murmur
[2:17:38] the devil was the first complainer
[2:17:41] I don't like the way things are up here
[2:17:46] I don't get enough Glory
[2:17:49] that's why God hates complaining
[2:17:53] amen murmuring
[2:17:55] nothing's ever good enough
[2:18:00] man I wish y'all felt like I did like I
[2:18:04] do
[2:18:05] this is good tomorrow the Holy Ghost you
[2:18:08] get the better it is it's just good
[2:18:11] I feel almost drunk up here
[2:18:15] praise be to God heard something brother
[2:18:17] Brian said I'm just gonna pitch in here
[2:18:18] maybe we'll close it's already about
[2:18:20] time
[2:18:21] listen
[2:18:24] I was listening to tape and he said
[2:18:26] something that caught my attention and I
[2:18:28] thought I gotta I gotta pull that back
[2:18:30] up sure enough I managed to find it
[2:18:32] again when you go through different
[2:18:33] tapes sometimes you don't know which one
[2:18:35] it was on but
[2:18:38] uh what was it forget the name of it
[2:18:42] but he says yes sir we pray so much
[2:18:44] today we pay so much to the Undertaker
[2:18:46] let's give some thoughts about the
[2:18:48] uptaker once in a while he says
[2:18:50] that'll take us up one of these days
[2:18:52] he's the only translation the one who
[2:18:55] can bring us out of the Grave the one
[2:18:57] who can present us before the father
[2:18:59] without full without smoke without
[2:19:02] wrinkle Hallelujah
[2:19:05] shout he says yes sir anybody that's got
[2:19:08] good religion shouts
[2:19:14] y'all remember
[2:19:16] I'm in the Pharisees they care they like
[2:19:19] it quiet
[2:19:21] and they heard all of them people say
[2:19:23] hosanna bam they're coming on a uh into
[2:19:26] Jerusalem riding upon the poles antigen
[2:19:28] again let's add it to the gang what did
[2:19:30] they say can you keep them quiet tell
[2:19:32] them to hold their peace what did Jesus
[2:19:34] say Jesus says if they're quiet the
[2:19:37] rocks will immediately cry out
[2:19:40] why because the scripture said that they
[2:19:43] would cry out and sing Hosanna and if
[2:19:45] they know somebody is something gonna
[2:19:47] describe
[2:20:02] over here
[2:20:04] I'm getting ready to do a little fun
[2:20:06] drink by the Tommy
[2:20:08] I'm practicing this morning
[2:20:12] people want to just man that they think
[2:20:14] that they're going to do it all over
[2:20:15] there if you don't do some of it here I
[2:20:17] wonder if you're going to be a doing
[2:20:18] over there
[2:20:20] Glory
[2:20:22] shouting going on
[2:20:25] whatever Jesus is there's always
[2:20:28] a lot of noise
[2:20:30] five because it's so good that I want no
[2:20:32] other makes me love my brother
[2:20:34] Hallelujah
[2:20:36] praise be to God
[2:20:38] so he just got some good shot in
[2:20:41] religion no doubt wasn't all over we got
[2:20:42] some more better stuff ready
[2:20:45] got something about
[2:20:48] an old colored man used to talk to me
[2:20:51] down the lane he says you believe in
[2:20:52] that old shout Religion Don't you Billy
[2:20:57] I said yes sir
[2:21:00] and he said you know what next morning
[2:21:02] he come by he was about 90 years old he
[2:21:04] says I want to tell you something I said
[2:21:06] all right what is it rep
[2:21:08] and he said well I'll tell you he says
[2:21:10] you take an old rooster and you can tie
[2:21:12] his feet and nail him down in the boxes
[2:21:15] any way you want to but said when it
[2:21:18] starts to get daylight he'll turn over
[2:21:20] and
[2:21:21] [Applause]
[2:21:24] all tied up he'll find a way come on
[2:21:27] he'll find a way to Crow
[2:21:31] I said that's right and he said what
[2:21:33] makes him do that
[2:21:34] and I said he's a rooster and it's
[2:21:36] breaking day that's right it's his
[2:21:38] nature and when a man is born of the
[2:21:40] spirit of God and has eternal life in
[2:21:42] him when the Holy Ghost comes you've got
[2:21:44] to scream out
[2:21:46] sorry
[2:21:48] something has happened

[2:22:24] peace that passes all understanding for

[2:22:28] he's at my everything I just can't
[2:22:30] praise him enough to say enough about
[2:22:32] him and what he means to me certainly
[2:22:34] it's a nature in you when you're born of
[2:22:37] the spirit of God you've got a nature in
[2:22:39] you that makes you scream out
[2:22:42] foreign
[2:22:48] when we get over there do you reckon
[2:22:50] that I'm gonna have to get up there or
[2:22:52] somebody's gonna have to get up there
[2:22:53] now let everybody shout
[2:22:55] no there ain't gonna be no coercing hey
[2:22:59] man I'm shop
[2:23:00] Ing and praising God when we get over
[2:23:02] there I think the fruit of Our Lives
[2:23:04] ought to get more praise to him while
[2:23:06] we're over here
[2:23:10] my mama
[2:23:14] Glory God is good ain't he
[2:23:16] [Applause]
[2:23:23] can I say what comes to mind
[2:23:25] I'd almost rather be up here than down
[2:23:28] there
[2:23:31] hey let me tell you something it's it's
[2:23:33] harder sometimes to get in the spirit
[2:23:35] and shout and scream when you're sitting
[2:23:37] here observing and just watching and
[2:23:39] spectating
[2:23:43] but when you're up here
[2:23:45] amen they shouldn't be that way she
[2:23:47] would all be into it isn't it right
[2:23:49] but you have you have to I realize you
[2:23:51] have to put a little extra effort into
[2:23:52] it
[2:23:53] I'm here your pastor I'm telling you're
[2:23:55] gonna have to put a little more effort
[2:23:56] into it if you want to catch the same
[2:23:57] Spirit have the same feeling get the
[2:23:59] baptism the Holy Ghost Amen in a greater
[2:24:02] way
[2:24:03] I like what Jesus said
[2:24:06] oh my I'm gonna go a little longer
[2:24:08] listen let me say this
[2:24:11] that Paul
[2:24:14] he talked about having joy unspeakable
[2:24:16] and full of Glory isn't that right
[2:24:18] and yet Paul was so poor
[2:24:21] and when Jesus came and most of the time
[2:24:23] when you find when Jesus came that he
[2:24:26] always talked about I came to give them
[2:24:29] eternal life and to raise him up at the
[2:24:31] last day
[2:24:32] so I call it the primary purpose of
[2:24:35] Christ's coming sure is this far in the
[2:24:37] assuring to be a father to us sure needs
[2:24:40] to care about sins apply all these
[2:24:41] things but his primary reason is if you
[2:24:43] have all those things and don't have
[2:24:45] eternal life it still isn't going to do
[2:24:46] you any good primary purpose there are
[2:24:49] primary reason for having Joy is having
[2:24:52] eternal life
[2:24:54] and I want to finish the scripture that
[2:24:55] we read talking about shall never hunger
[2:24:58] shall never thirst
[2:25:02] let me just throw this in
[2:25:04] maybe sometimes the reason that we're
[2:25:06] getting the things from the Father the
[2:25:08] way that we should huh
[2:25:10] and then we're not getting the
[2:25:11] satisfaction we should is because we're
[2:25:13] looking too much at the things of this
[2:25:14] world
[2:25:15] and we are not looking up we are not
[2:25:17] looking up there to find our
[2:25:19] satisfaction our joy our pleasure our
[2:25:23] healing our comfort
[2:25:26] how many times she said I'm gonna give
[2:25:28] you a comforter because I know you all
[2:25:29] needed I'm everybody need the comfort
[2:25:32] you know
[2:25:34] my listen I came down from heaven not to
[2:25:37] do my own will
[2:25:39] let me go skip one and I don't want to
[2:25:41] skip it
[2:25:42] but I said unto you that ye also have
[2:25:44] seen me and believe not all that
[2:25:47] all day shall come to me and him that
[2:25:50] cometh to me I will in no wise cast out
[2:25:55] I came I came down from heaven not to do
[2:25:59] my own will but the will of him that
[2:26:01] sent me now listen to what the will is
[2:26:02] and this is the Father's will which has
[2:26:05] sent me that of all which he hath given
[2:26:08] me I should lose nothing
[2:26:13] foreign
[2:26:15] oh my
[2:26:17] I'm not there yet
[2:26:19] I haven't made it home yet
[2:26:21] but I know that it was Christ that has
[2:26:23] led me so safe thus far he hasn't lost
[2:26:26] me yet and I don't believe he's gonna
[2:26:27] lose me
[2:26:30] how many is happy about that
[2:26:33] the fact that he hasn't lost you yet
[2:26:34] you're still serving God
[2:26:36] you're still going
[2:26:38] and you know and have confidence and
[2:26:40] faith that he'll not lose nothing
[2:26:42] but should raise it up again at the last
[2:26:45] day again he says this is the will of
[2:26:48] him that sent me that everyone would see
[2:26:50] it the son and believeth on him may have
[2:26:52] everlasting life and I shall raise him
[2:26:55] up at the last day many different places
[2:26:57] Dr Jesus talked about he says I am come
[2:27:00] to give them eternal life and to raise
[2:27:02] him up the last day
[2:27:04] let me tell you something our spiritual
[2:27:06] happiness our walk our Holy Spirit or uh
[2:27:10] Joy is not determined by the things that
[2:27:13] we possess here on Earth
[2:27:15] because Paul he didn't possess anything
[2:27:17] but yet he had the greatest joy he knew
[2:27:19] what it was like to be have godliness
[2:27:20] with contentment
[2:27:22] is that right and even though he had
[2:27:24] nothing let me tell you something a lot
[2:27:26] of times Jesus I don't say that Jesus
[2:27:28] ever promised he says and I came to give
[2:27:30] them riches in this world
[2:27:33] never said that
[2:27:35] he
[2:27:36] says blessed are the poor blessed are
[2:27:38] those and the hunger and thirst and all
[2:27:40] these other things in this life because
[2:27:42] they'll be filming that life
[2:27:44] if anything he promised your hardship
[2:27:46] struggles
[2:27:47] I'm in those down through the Dark Ages
[2:27:49] they didn't have a nice psych we got
[2:27:51] they had to hide in catacombs and caves
[2:27:53] and run for their lives
[2:27:55] for hundreds and hundreds of years their
[2:27:58] lives were in Jeopardy all the time
[2:28:01] amen I have a feeling we're gonna creep
[2:28:03] up closer to the Jeopardy of Our Lives
[2:28:05] as time goes on folks something else
[2:28:08] came to me this morning you better enjoy
[2:28:10] church
[2:28:11] because we've been told by a prophet of
[2:28:12] God they'll close places like this up
[2:28:14] when we come to church we better enjoy
[2:28:17] able to come to church
[2:28:20] amen because we don't know how much
[2:28:21] longer we'll be able to do it
[2:28:25] well that brother Byler you preached
[2:28:27] something political we're shutting you
[2:28:29] down that's what will happen
[2:28:30] we don't like what you said
[2:28:33] we'll shut you down
[2:28:35] oh it'll be something like that's almost
[2:28:36] that way already
[2:28:39] huh
[2:28:40] but anyway
[2:28:43] please stay there
[2:28:45] yes on the other hand Jesus didn't have
[2:28:47] a whole lot of the world's good
[2:28:49] he was the richest spiritually there was
[2:28:52] but isn't it strange how did those who
[2:28:55] were rich and increase with Goods had
[2:28:57] needed nothing there to Mary wants and
[2:28:59] put him outside the church
[2:29:01] in our generation
[2:29:04] they thought they were spiritually rich
[2:29:07] they thought they were so rich they
[2:29:08] speak
[2:29:09] in tongues and so forth and they were
[2:29:11] they were where they needed to be they
[2:29:12] didn't know no Prophet they didn't need
[2:29:14] discernment they didn't need Jesus
[2:29:16] coming down and Discerning thoughts and
[2:29:18] hands of the heart as a matter of fact
[2:29:19] they said any of our people any of you
[2:29:21] people from this church if you go to
[2:29:23] that over there the bread abandons
[2:29:24] meeting and sponsors will put your name
[2:29:26] out
[2:29:28] and Jesus himself would come and
[2:29:31] vindicate himself
[2:29:32] that's our church age rich and increased
[2:29:36] let me tell you where were their
[2:29:37] affections
[2:29:39] their meal ticket
[2:29:41] huh
[2:29:42] that's what their affection was
[2:29:45] sad
[2:29:47] amen
[2:29:49] but aren't you glad
[2:29:51] that you've got to thirst in your heart
[2:29:52] for moral God
[2:29:56] how many wants to be the fullness of the
[2:29:57] Christian that you're supposed to be
[2:30:00] and you have a mediator you have a
[2:30:01] mediator that can take you further than
[2:30:03] what you are and you're Christian
[2:30:06] he's there he's a good mediator
[2:30:08] and about even Paul says let us come
[2:30:10] boldly before the throne of grace that
[2:30:13] we might get help because that's what
[2:30:14] he's there for to get your help he can
[2:30:16] be touched by the feeling of infirmity
[2:30:18] he has been tempted he's going through
[2:30:19] everything that we have gone through yet
[2:30:21] without sin
[2:30:23] amen God bless you stand with me this
[2:30:25] morning if you will
[2:30:28] if you get the kind of passion you get
[2:30:30] the kind of Desire that David had
[2:30:31] because as a heart Panther for the water
[2:30:33] Brooks old my soul penteth for thee for
[2:30:37] what for the Living God he wanted to see
[2:30:39] the Living God like I said Wednesday
[2:30:40] isn't that one of the hearts desires
[2:30:42] Lord we want to see the Living God we
[2:30:44] want you real in our life
[2:30:46] we don't want to just come to church and
[2:30:48] uh go back out and well I feel about the
[2:30:50] same way as I did when I come in
[2:30:52] huh
[2:30:54] no we wouldn't have God come down and be
[2:30:56] real in our life
[2:30:58] amen
[2:30:59] with our eyes closed
[2:31:03] both here and those lists
[2:31:06] ask yourself this question is your
[2:31:08] desire
[2:31:10] is your passion
[2:31:13] is your affection
[2:31:16] where it should be
[2:31:18] uh could you raise your hand say it's
[2:31:20] not quite where it should be I'm guilty
[2:31:22] brother Byler and I ask God to help me
[2:31:25] help me to set my affections on things
[2:31:28] above
[2:31:29] and not on things below just like Paul
[2:31:32] no matter what he had or didn't have
[2:31:35] if you don't have a dime in your account
[2:31:37] if you've got eternal life you're the
[2:31:39] richest person in the world
[2:31:41] all the other things will pass away but
[2:31:42] eternal life will never pass away
[2:31:45] Lord Jesus you see the hands that are up
[2:31:47] both here and those listening God that
[2:31:50] they realize that their affections are
[2:31:52] just not where they should be they're
[2:31:53] props Christians and so forth but in the
[2:31:55] world that we're living in it's too easy
[2:31:57] to get affections on the things of the
[2:31:59] world and those things around us
[2:32:02] our jobs and everything else and our
[2:32:06] affection isn't the way it's supposed to
[2:32:07] be with God we repent this morning
[2:32:09] raising our hands and saying God we're
[2:32:11] guilty we're sorry where our affections
[2:32:13] aren't where they're supposed to be Lord
[2:32:15] help us our affection to be on you Lord
[2:32:18] Jesus the one that takes care of us the
[2:32:20] one that we pray to and that intercedes
[2:32:22] for us and and it takes care of all of
[2:32:25] our needs that and and it takes care of
[2:32:27] our problems Lord Jesus and helps us
[2:32:29] gives us joy gives us peace gives us
[2:32:32] comfort
[2:32:34] Lord we don't have to turn to the devil
[2:32:36] we don't have to turn to the things of
[2:32:37] the world for our pleasure you are our
[2:32:40] pleasure
[2:32:41] Lord help us to seek those things above
[2:32:43] Lord where you said at the right hand of
[2:32:45] God where you're on in in power you're
[2:32:48] the one that controls things Lord in our
[2:32:51] life Lord and we give you complete
[2:32:52] control this morning saying God help us
[2:32:55] from this morning on
[2:32:56] to make sure that our factions that our
[2:33:00] treasure is in you and not on the things
[2:33:02] of this world God and I ask Lord that
[2:33:04] you'll take all the sins and all the
[2:33:06] failures of where we failed now and put
[2:33:09] them in the blood of Jesus Christ Lord
[2:33:10] we believe God when we confess our sins
[2:33:13] Lord you're faithful and just to forgive
[2:33:15] us of our sins
[2:33:16] Lord and I ask God that put in the
[2:33:18] bleach of Jesus Christ never to be
[2:33:20] remembered no more and may we go from
[2:33:23] here different than what we came in
[2:33:25] that our affections are more on the
[2:33:28] things of the bum above than they are
[2:33:30] from Below in Jesus Christ's name amen
[2:33:34] and amen
[2:33:36] I have found his Graces all complete
[2:33:39] Joy
