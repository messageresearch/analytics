[40:09] CH us do it and we love you in Jesus
[40:11] name amen amen turn your bibles if you
[40:15] will amen the book of St John St John 3
[40:29] St John 3:1 there was a man of the
[40:33] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[40:36] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[40:39] said unto him Rabbi we know that thou
[40:42] art a teacher come from God for no man
[40:45] can do these Miracles that thou doest
[40:47] except God be with him Jesus aned and
[40:50] said unto him verily verily I say unto
[40:52] you except a man that be born again he
[40:54] cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus
[40:58] saith unto him how can a man be born
[41:00] when he is old can he enter the second
[41:02] time into his mother's womb and be
[41:04] born Jesus answer us answered verily
[41:09] verily I say unto you except a man be
[41:11] born of water and of spirit he cannot
[41:14] enter into the kingdom of God that which
[41:17] is born of flesh is flesh and that which
[41:19] is born of the spirit is spirit amen
[41:21] Marvel not that I said unto ye the unto
[41:24] thee ye must be born again and do you
[41:26] have the title up there for
[41:28] us
[41:31] amen if not yeah and that which is my
[41:34] title is going to be that which is flesh
[41:37] and that which is spirit I meant to put
[41:39] on there that which is flesh is flesh
[41:42] and that which is spirit is spirit amen
[41:46] so that's our title tonight amen God
[41:49] bless the reading of the word you can be
[41:51] seated amen and I just want to read a
[41:53] couple more and then uh to try to lay a
[41:56] foundation ation if we could
[42:01] amen but him brother Jesus here talking
[42:05] to Nicodemus Nicodemus coming to him by
[42:08] night and you
[42:12] know confessing that nobody could do
[42:14] these things unless he came of God and
[42:17] Jesus begin to tell him you know that
[42:20] about the New Birth amen the first great
[42:23] commandment amen and then that is that
[42:25] you've got to be born again and he kind
[42:27] of explains it and I love the
[42:29] explanation and and I don't think I've
[42:32] ever preached on this before not and at
[42:34] least not with this title amen uh but I
[42:38] like what he's saying and he's making a
[42:40] point and the point is of course that
[42:42] you got to be born again of water and of
[42:44] spirit and then he just makes that blunt
[42:47] statement that which is born of flesh is
[42:50] flesh and that which is born of the
[42:53] spirit is spirit amen
[43:00] Amen in St John 6 and verse uh
[43:07] 62 St John 6 just a few pages
[43:14] over it
[43:15] says it is the spirit that quickeneth
[43:20] the flesh
[43:22] profites nothing
[43:25] wow that right so Jesus said the pro the
[43:29] the flesh don't profit
[43:32] anything amen we'll cover that here in a
[43:35] minute it is the spirit that
[43:39] quickeneth amen the words that I speak
[43:42] unto you they are spirit and they are
[43:50] life how many knows what our greatest
[43:52] enemy
[43:53] is the flesh it's your greatest enemy
[43:59] not even the devil is as great as your
[44:00] flesh when it comes to your enemy it's
[44:04] your greatest
[44:05] enemy
[44:07] amen all right let me give you the
[44:09] scripture for it I wasn't going to I was
[44:11] going to skip this but I feel that
[44:14] strangely just to go this way in
[44:17] Galatians 5 and verse 16 this is just to
[44:21] make uh to uh vindicate what I just said
[44:25] about the flesh is profiteth nothing so
[44:28] what what are the works of the flesh
[44:31] Galatians 5 and verse 19 it says now the
[44:34] works of the the flesh are manifest
[44:38] which are these love joy peace
[44:43] longsuffering no
[44:48] adultery
[44:50] fornication
[44:52] uncleanness
[44:54] lasciviousness idolatry
[45:00] witchcraft all that witchcraft that's
[45:02] all one of the manifestations of the
[45:06] flesh this is what the flesh will
[45:09] do
[45:12] wrath witchcraft
[45:15] hatred variance
[45:18] emulation wrath strife
[45:22] seditions
[45:24] heresies envyings
[45:28] murder let your flesh rule one time and
[45:32] it can lead to murder that's right let
[45:34] somebody do just the wrong thing at the
[45:36] right time lose your temper like Cain
[45:39] did is that right he started out with
[45:42] Envy he started out with jealousy it
[45:45] turned into hatred and then it turned
[45:47] into
[45:49] murder that's where the flesh goes
[45:52] that's why Jesus said there ain't much
[45:54] good about your flesh
[45:57] it was born in sin shaping in iniquity
[45:59] come into this world speaking lies ain't
[46:01] that right that's why you got to have a
[46:04] new birth because that first one ain't
[46:05] no good ain't nothing good about our
[46:08] first birth why do you think he said
[46:11] you've got to be born
[46:13] again and born of what born of spirit
[46:17] born of the Holy Spirit we know we are
[46:20] Triune being we're outside is flesh then
[46:24] we have a spirit that you at your birth
[46:27] you pull in suck in a spirit is that
[46:30] right amen you become a living
[46:32] Soul on the inside of that is your soul
[46:35] that's a very being your very being is
[46:38] on the inside of the inside amen so the
[46:42] spirit has a lot to do with it
[46:44] amen my it goes on envyings murderers
[46:48] drunkenness and reings is that what the
[46:51] world is all
[46:53] manifesting and such like of the which I
[46:55] tell you before as I have told you in
[46:58] times past that they which do such
[47:00] things shall not go to
[47:05] heaven they shall not inherit the
[47:08] kingdom of
[47:09] God but the spirit the fruit of the
[47:13] spirit is
[47:16] love amen the opposite of
[47:19] hatred praise the Lord why because that
[47:23] which is flesh is flesh
[47:27] and that which is spirit is
[47:30] Spirit if you're born into the flesh
[47:34] you're going to do what the flesh does
[47:36] until you are born again you will be
[47:39] catering to that flesh you'll never be
[47:41] able to get away from
[47:43] it it's your
[47:46] nature you can even think oh I'm going
[47:49] to you know somebody smack you or be
[47:51] mean to you oh I'm going to be mean I'm
[47:52] going to be nice
[47:54] back but guess what down on the ins side
[47:57] you don't really want
[47:59] to I'm just supposed to you do it
[48:02] because you're supposed to or or
[48:04] whatever you've been taught
[48:06] to all right praise the Lord let me go
[48:10] on but the fruit of the spirit is love
[48:13] and joy and peace
[48:18] longsuffering gentleness and goodness
[48:21] and
[48:22] Faith oh my well how much greater
[48:27] the spirit
[48:30] is
[48:31] meekness not
[48:33] Pride
[48:35] Temperance against such there is no law
[48:38] and they that are Christ have crucified
[48:40] the flesh with the affections and Lust
[48:43] For if we live in the spirit let us also
[48:46] walk in the
[48:50] spirit praise the
[48:52] Lord Romans 8 says there is therefore
[48:55] now no condemnation to the that are in
[48:57] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[48:59] flesh but after the
[49:02] spirit amen how many believes that's
[49:05] what we need to be doing we invest so
[49:08] much
[49:09] time so much of our lives are spent
[49:12] around taking care of the
[49:17] flesh it's the
[49:20] truth but we ought to be spiritually
[49:24] strong we ought to make sure that there
[49:26] our spirit the holy spirit is taken care
[49:30] of how do we do that and I'll get into
[49:33] that because I want to talk to you a
[49:34] little bit about uh uh impersonations
[49:37] impersonators and the greatest stumbling
[49:39] block that uh is known to
[49:42] humanity I believe brother B said the
[49:44] biggest stumbling block is somebody that
[49:46] has a profession but not a possession
[49:50] they're impersonators or
[49:55] Hypocrites and they act like the
[49:57] Christians but guess what they can't
[49:59] never overcome the flesh they'll never
[50:00] overcome they'll never really be able to
[50:03] conquer that flesh they'll still have
[50:06] jealousy they'll still have Strife
[50:08] they'll still have fusses and
[50:11] arguments can't get along with nobody
[50:15] unsatisfied
[50:18] hello amen
[50:28] amen this thought came to me yesterday
[50:31] just thought on it a little bit and then
[50:33] last night I woke up by
[50:35] 12:00 and for some reason that thought
[50:38] came back and I begin to think this am
[50:40] man and I quickly got my phone shut
[50:43] Niagara falls
[50:45] off that's what I listen to All Night
[50:48] Long Niagara
[50:52] Falls I shut the Niagara Falls off and
[50:54] got on that memo
[50:57] and talked about you know the the the
[50:59] flesh is flesh and the spirit is Spirit
[51:01] and the Lord begin to pour it out amen
[51:04] and I said man if I go back to sleep
[51:06] tomorrow morning I'll say boy you should
[51:08] have written it down you done forgot
[51:10] what the Lord showed you because you
[51:11] didn't do it
[51:13] amen oh my let me read on okay the Bible
[51:18] says for to be carnally minded is death
[51:20] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[51:22] peace amen listen so he says verse eight
[51:26] Paul says so that they that are in the
[51:27] flesh cannot please God in other words
[51:30] if you're taking care of your
[51:32] flesh you're living by your feelings and
[51:34] your emotions and all of that you cannot
[51:37] please God you won't please
[51:42] God but you are not in the flesh Paul
[51:45] says we are living in the flesh but
[51:47] you're not living according to the flesh
[51:49] but in the spirit if so be that the
[51:51] spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[51:53] man have not the spirit of Christ he is
[51:56] not of his you got to be born
[52:00] again well that's kind of simple I don't
[52:03] care how simple it is that's what God
[52:04] told me to preach tonight that's what
[52:06] we're
[52:08] preaching
[52:10] amen amen praise the Lord and if Christ
[52:14] been you is in you the body is dead
[52:16] because of sin because but the spirit of
[52:19] life because is life because of
[52:21] righteousness and here's that famous
[52:23] scripture but if the spirit of him that
[52:25] raised up Christ from the dead dwell in
[52:28] you he that raised up Christ from the
[52:31] dead shall also make alive your mortal
[52:36] body in other words it's going to have a
[52:37] little effect on this
[52:39] flesh it's going to cause you to come
[52:42] alive cuz I don't know about you but I
[52:43] don't like to be dead I don't like to be
[52:48] stagnant I like to be alive how many
[52:51] likes to be
[52:52] alive most people are zombies
[52:56] walking around
[52:59] unhappy no Holy Spirit no you know just
[53:03] satisfying the flesh it's all they live
[53:05] for and it brings forth death it's
[53:09] death but the spirit is life listen what
[53:12] Jesus said the words that I speak to you
[53:15] they are spirit and they are
[53:18] life how many believes that that's why
[53:22] the prophet of God said you know the
[53:23] Holy Spirit only feeds on one
[53:27] thing the Holy Spirit feeds on one thing
[53:30] and that is the word of God it don't
[53:34] feed on Hollywood it don't feed on the
[53:36] trash it don't feed on the ACC caring of
[53:38] the world it don't feed on ifs maybe sir
[53:42] I think so or my ideas no it's got to be
[53:45] thus day of the Lord that's what it
[53:46] feeds

[54:14] it 1 Peter 1 and
[54:17] verse 23 being born again not of
[54:22] corruptible seed but of incorruptible

[54:30] that second birth is a birth that's
[54:32] birthed by the word by the word of God
[54:35] you've been born again because you
[54:36] believe the word of God you accept the

[54:59] life and in your soul you're become a
[55:02] son and daughter of God you've been
[55:04] born born

[55:12] is as grass and all the glory of man is
[55:14] as the flower of grass the grass
[55:17] withereth and the flower thereof falleth
[55:19] away but the word of the Lord endureth
[55:24] forever how many believe you've been BN
[55:27] by the word of God that endures forever
[55:30] Jesus said I come to give you eternal
[55:33] life that inside man he's an eternal
[55:38] being he's not

[56:01] soul that inside man that new
[56:04] man the outside May perish but the inart
[56:07] man is renewed day by
[56:12] day
[56:13] amen that which is flesh is
[56:17] flesh amen all right let
[56:19] me hurry up might as well say
[56:24] it all right let's go back a little bit
[56:27] cuz I want to pick up this
[56:30] appetite of the believer is that right
[56:33] talk a little bit about appetite and
[56:35] thirst amen but first we want to compare
[56:38] and talk
[56:40] about amen talk about that which is
[56:42] flesh is flesh and that which is uh uh
[56:45] uh spirit is
[56:47] spirit and man you go all the way back
[56:49] to Cain he was a carnal
[56:53] believer is that right he worshiped ship
[56:56] God he went to church but he worshiped
[56:59] God just according to what he
[57:02] thought he worshiped God his
[57:05] way what he thought was
[57:08] right he was a natural
[57:11] believer a fleshly Believer and he hated
[57:15] Abel why because Abel was a spiritual
[57:19] believer and Abel had a revelation that
[57:23] it wasn't no apple he realized it had to
[57:25] do with blood it was Eve and Adam that
[57:29] sinned they were blood isin't that right
[57:32] and something had to pay for their
[57:35] sin something that's living and had to
[57:37] be a sheep at that time he had a
[57:40] revelation and Abel the Bible says that
[57:43] he offered to God a sacrifice am me he
[57:45] took a lamb grabbed the lamb out of his
[57:47] herd come up to a rock somewhere took a
[57:50] stone and begin to hacking at his throat
[57:53] hacking at his throat hacking and
[57:54] hacking brutal
[57:56] blood splattering all over him and
[57:58] everything else he looked up bloody M he
[58:00] says that's what I'm looking
[58:02] for that's what it's going to take to
[58:05] cover blood without the shedding of
[58:06] blood there is no remission of sins
[58:09] something's going to have to die to pay
[58:11] the price because he knew Jesus the lamb
[58:13] was going to come and that he was going
[58:14] to shed his blood and he was going to
[58:16] have blood all over him blood everywhere
[58:19] but he was going to pay for
[58:21] sin he had the Revelation he had it by
[58:25] spiritual
[58:26] Revelation can I say something very
[58:30] quietly just your
[58:33] carnal worship isn't what God is looking
[58:36] for they that worship Him must worship
[58:40] Him in
[58:42] spirit and in
[58:45] truth
[58:47] amen you have to worship Him by
[58:50] spiritual Revelation when God
[58:52] spiritually reveals himself to you and
[58:56] gives you of his Spirit then you're
[58:58] ready to worship
[59:00] Him the world is full of carnal
[59:05] worshippers a't that right the Pharisees
[59:08] worshiped they Sayang that it all of
[59:10] that is in vain do you worship me why
[59:13] because you're teaching the doctrines of
[59:15] man you don't come my way so I'm not
[59:18] accepting it he didn't accept Cain's
[59:23] worship and because of that
[59:27] Cain hated
[59:28] him Cain hated
[59:31] Abel brother bam says the carinal
[59:34] believer will always persecute the
[59:36] spiritual believer the carnal believer
[59:39] hates the spiritual
[59:40] believer
[59:42] amen try any way to put him to death get
[59:46] rid of him jealous of
[59:49] him
[59:51] amen you can have somebody sitting in
[59:53] the pews and and they're backslid
[59:58] they got Moss all over them somebody's
[1:00:00] horn is
[1:00:03] blowing and then there's another one oh
[1:00:05] praise be to God hallelujah preach it
[1:00:07] brother and the other look over like
[1:00:10] what who do they think they are huh they
[1:00:13] think they're so
[1:00:14] spiritual huh that's a natural
[1:00:18] man perhaps jealous or envious of a
[1:00:21] spiritual person
[1:00:24] amen all right was it the same way with
[1:00:27] the
[1:00:28] Pharisees what were they oh they looked
[1:00:31] like believers they acted like
[1:00:34] Believers a that right they worship like
[1:00:37] it but Jesus say you
[1:00:39] Hypocrites you do all these things they
[1:00:42] had pride in their hearts Ain that right
[1:00:45] they were jealous of Jesus when the
[1:00:47] Great crowds followed
[1:00:48] him they wanted to get rid of him many
[1:00:51] times they tried to kill him they had
[1:00:53] murder in their hearts even in the end
[1:00:57] away with him away with him crucify him
[1:01:00] a man that raised the BL the dead up and
[1:01:02] everything else why that which is flesh
[1:01:05] is
[1:01:06] flesh and that which is spirit is
[1:01:10] Spirit woo M we don't want that which is
[1:01:15] flesh we want that which is
[1:01:17] spirit
[1:01:20] amen think
[1:01:22] about all down through there Pharisees
[1:01:25] especially they were proud out didn't
[1:01:26] want at the uppermost seats they still
[1:01:28] had all of the works of the flesh Pride
[1:01:31] jealousy hatred
[1:01:34] murder can't get away with it can't get
[1:01:36] away from it the only way to get away
[1:01:39] from it is to get a new
[1:01:40] birth let the Holy Spirit rule your
[1:01:46] life
[1:01:49] amen all right I didn't finish Romans
[1:01:52] let me RA finish it is that okay
[1:01:56] if it dwells in your body your mortal
[1:01:59] body it will also Quicken your Mor
[1:02:01] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:02:02] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[1:02:04] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[1:02:05] after the flesh but to live after uh for
[1:02:08] if if ye live after the flesh ye shall
[1:02:11] die pretty plain ain't got to do a lot
[1:02:15] of preaching on
[1:02:16] that but if you through the spirit do
[1:02:19] cleanse the Deeds of the flesh you shall
[1:02:23] live how many knows that you get enough
[1:02:26] of the Holy Ghost you can't overcome
[1:02:27] them things by yourself you need more of
[1:02:30] the Holy Ghost that's why we say greater
[1:02:33] is he that is in the flesh in you than
[1:02:36] you the flesh that's in the world how
[1:02:38] many glad that the greater is he that is
[1:02:41] in me than he that is in the
[1:02:44] world
[1:02:46] Amen for as many as Le are led by the
[1:02:48] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:02:52] see the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:02:54] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:02:57] of
[1:02:59] God
[1:03:01] Amen praise the
[1:03:03] Lord let's go for a few minutes back to
[1:03:05] the Old
[1:03:08] Testament
[1:03:12] David he had a
[1:03:14] revelation he was a spiritual man that
[1:03:18] right he was a spiritual
[1:03:23] man God had helped him and work through
[1:03:27] him to kill a lion and a bear and when
[1:03:30] he seen that Philistine that Goliath the
[1:03:33] carnal man Little rdy David we all
[1:03:37] understand the prophet painted him as a
[1:03:39] skinny
[1:03:40] little um
[1:03:42] shrimp you
[1:03:44] know sometimes people are just extra
[1:03:46] small and extra skinny you
[1:03:49] know Micah was that way when he was
[1:03:51] growing up he's not that way anymore but
[1:03:54] he's a little shrimp
[1:03:59] I wouldn't want to call him a shrimp now
[1:04:01] man but anyway that's kind of like what
[1:04:04] David was just a shrimp and there was
[1:04:07] Goliath huh
[1:04:10] Hercules huge Mammoth bulging
[1:04:16] muscles great big thick neck no doubt
[1:04:20] huge humongous with a great big sword
[1:04:23] 14inch fingers
[1:04:27] huh come on out here huh that was the
[1:04:31] natural man making his boast is that
[1:04:37] right come out there and he made his
[1:04:39] boast to David but David had a
[1:04:41] revelation in his heart he was full of
[1:04:43] faith in God he took his five smooth
[1:04:47] stones and said you come with me you
[1:04:50] come with you me with your
[1:04:54] carnality amen
[1:04:57] how many know even God said amen go ye

[1:05:18] bites them if serpent or whatever bites
[1:05:21] them and the then they thing it shall
[1:05:23] not harm them all those carnal things
[1:05:26] the spiritual man is called to knock him
[1:05:32] down just as Goliath the natural man he
[1:05:36] was
[1:05:37] flesh that which is flesh is
[1:05:41] flesh and to challenge something that's
[1:05:45] spirit amen what's going to win the
[1:05:49] spirit's going to
[1:05:51] win the spirit's going to win just like
[1:05:54] David and
[1:05:57] Goliath he probably didn't look like
[1:05:59] much down there I wonder how far away he
[1:06:02] was I wonder how far away he
[1:06:07] was but no doubt if a lot of them maybe
[1:06:11] couldn't see him maybe they were down
[1:06:12] too low or something but that little guy

[1:13:00] that peace anymore I don't have to jump

[1:13:20] miserable person as the Propet said a
[1:13:21] backl person is the most miserable
[1:13:24] person because you know what it's like
[1:13:25] to have that real freedom and that
[1:13:28] enjoyment and that joy of the Lord when
[1:13:30] you get away from that I got to get back
[1:13:33] I got to get
[1:13:36] back amen if you're a real believer if
[1:13:39] you're of the spirit that which is
[1:13:41] spirit is spirit and if you're of the
[1:13:43] spirit brother bam says man I got to eat

[1:14:10] ought to be get that spring flowing
[1:14:15] amen get that stream flowing once
[1:14:19] again praise the
[1:14:22] Lord Paul Shipwrecked ain't that right
[1:14:25] he had problems the carnal part of it
[1:14:28] was that they were amen a storm was
[1:14:30] coming and it was taking the ship and
[1:14:31] they thought they were all going to die
[1:14:34] a that right the angel said Paul tell
[1:14:37] everybody to stay on the ship if nobody
[1:14:40] gets off the ship nobody ja bails out
[1:14:42] everybody will be all right a that right
[1:14:46] and Paul told them and they obeyed and
[1:14:48] the all was okay that's kind of like us
[1:14:51] on the troubled Seas through our
[1:14:52] troubles and trials our natural trials
[1:14:55] and the carnality and so forth amen if
[1:14:58] you stay on the ship just hang on to God
[1:15:00] just hang on there God will take you
[1:15:06] through amen then he thought he got
[1:15:09] through ain't that right they were all
[1:15:11] having a weeny roast around the
[1:15:14] fire I hope they were good beef be hot
[1:15:17] dogs I love
[1:15:19] them but anyway and that's right now all
[1:15:22] of a sudden the Viper came out and bit
[1:15:24] Paul on the arm I believe it is big old
[1:15:27] deadly Mamba perhaps and they were all
[1:15:29] watching
[1:15:32] him thinking he was going to
[1:15:34] die watching
[1:15:37] him I've watched a cat die from a from a
[1:15:40] snake bite and boy it just goes slow and
[1:15:43] just to begin
[1:15:45] to can't hardly move paralyze manage
[1:15:48] just all kinds of terrible thing they
[1:15:50] were all watching
[1:15:55] Paul says hey Sam would you
[1:15:57] mind pass me another hot dog I want to
[1:16:00] roast it give me some of the
[1:16:02] marshmallows or maybe it was soup I
[1:16:04] don't know what it
[1:16:05] was you just get off of here huh what
[1:16:10] are you
[1:16:14] doing and they said in their minds when
[1:16:17] he was bit he said you know he escaped
[1:16:19] the
[1:16:21] sea but vengeance is coming after him
[1:16:25] and he's not going to escape here here a
[1:16:28] snakes bike it's going to get
[1:16:30] him
[1:16:32] amen praise the Lord but what
[1:16:37] happened maybe they didn't listen to
[1:16:39] Paul too much testifying this that or
[1:16:41] the other yeah we've heard it before
[1:16:43] we've heard it before but guess what
[1:16:46] after he shook that snake off and it
[1:16:48] didn't affect him their ears come
[1:16:53] unstopped and and when he said a
[1:16:57] word you know when he
[1:16:59] spoke they
[1:17:03] listened because they knew they thought
[1:17:05] they thought he's some kind of God after
[1:17:08] that well he's a amateur
[1:17:12] God but it was God in him that was
[1:17:15] greater than the carnal situation how
[1:17:18] many he's glad for that God in you is
[1:17:21] greater than your carnal situation and
[1:17:23] problem God doesn't keep you from carnal
[1:17:25] problems and situations from coming but
[1:17:28] he'll see you through if you are in him
[1:17:31] and he is in you amen praise the Lord
[1:17:36] whether it's sickness casting out Devils
[1:17:40] cancer doesn't matter what it is amen
[1:17:43] praise the
[1:17:45] Lord praise the Lord we're hungry
[1:17:48] hunger how many beli we need to hunger
[1:17:51] for the word more not just on Wednesday
[1:17:53] on Sunday but every day we should Hunger
[1:17:56] for More Of God I want
[1:18:00] more
[1:18:02] more amen woo I'm already my cup is
[1:18:05] already full brother Danny brother John
[1:18:09] my cup's already full but guess what I
[1:18:11] want it running
[1:18:14] over I want it pressed down good measure
[1:18:17] and running over there's
[1:18:21] more how many believes there's more of
[1:18:23] Jesus for you to be have
[1:18:25] there's more of the spirit for you to
[1:18:27] have so many people come to church and
[1:18:30] they sing songs and they do this that or
[1:18:32] the other and they go through the
[1:18:34] motions brother brand said he says but
[1:18:36] why don't they get in spirit first what
[1:18:39] you want to do is get in the spirit you
[1:18:41] want Revelations you want God you want
[1:18:44] you want joy you want all these things
[1:18:46] you have got to get into Spirit first
[1:18:49] because that's where you'll find it you
[1:18:51] won't find it
[1:18:56] in natural eating drinking or taking
[1:19:00] care of your natural body you won't get
[1:19:01] it there see that's why God said why
[1:19:04] Jesus said that which is flesh is flesh
[1:19:08] and that which is spirit is Spirit
[1:19:10] that's why you've got to be born again
[1:19:13] of the spirit of God praise the
[1:19:19] Lord and you do it by how how do we get
[1:19:22] more of the spirit
[1:19:29] praying I'm giving you a little time cuz
[1:19:32] I want you to think about how much time
[1:19:35] you spend in prayer talking to
[1:19:38] God how much do you really spend because
[1:19:41] how many knows it's awfully
[1:19:43] busy it's easy to go too long without
[1:19:47] praying and talking to
[1:19:49] God and then let me say this is
[1:19:52] important also it's important that you
[1:19:54] listen
[1:19:55] because he wants to talk back to
[1:20:00] you let me stop there a minute I believe
[1:20:03] that is just as important if not more so
[1:20:07] than prayer is to listen to what he
[1:20:11] wants to say to you what good does it do
[1:20:13] for me to just talk to
[1:20:16] you how you doing Mark doing pretty good
[1:20:20] yeah everything good right just talking
[1:20:22] to you and talk to you and
[1:20:24] and you never talk
[1:20:27] back wow I couldn't get a word in
[1:20:30] jwise but it's nice when somebody take
[1:20:34] some time and say Lord now speak
[1:20:35] something back lord speak back to
[1:20:38] me amen give him time to speak to you
[1:20:48] amen what do you think about the other
[1:20:51] way
[1:20:52] is what do you think about all the time
[1:20:57] amen that's part of one of the reasons I
[1:20:59] like
[1:21:01] preaching because that's one time when
[1:21:02] we get of course I do it pretty much I
[1:21:05] try to do it as much whether I'm working
[1:21:07] or wherever I am keep my mind stayed on
[1:21:09] him blessed is he whose mind is stayed
[1:21:12] on thee but sometimes you got to work
[1:21:14] this out or the other but sometimes it's
[1:21:17] very very good when you uh just perhaps
[1:21:21] take some time and just meditate on them
[1:21:22] you can do it laying on your bed just
[1:21:24] lay on your bed and and think about him
[1:21:26] is that
[1:21:27] right because when you think about the
[1:21:30] word of God when you think about how he
[1:21:32] justified you saved you how if you ever
[1:21:35] made it you already made it he thought
[1:21:38] of you before the found think start
[1:21:39] thinking on the things you know what the
[1:21:42] Bible said think on the things if there
[1:21:44] be anything good a good
[1:21:47] report honest good and all these things
[1:21:50] Philippians 48 somewhere in there he
[1:21:53] said think on the things CU what you
[1:21:56] think
[1:21:58] about is what empowers
[1:22:00] you it's what you're feeding on it's
[1:22:03] going in
[1:22:05] amen why do you think David said in
[1:22:08] Psalms he said blessed is the man that
[1:22:11] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:22:12] ungodly nor standeth in the way of the
[1:22:14] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:22:18] scornful amen don't want to be around in
[1:22:21] a bunch of negative
[1:22:22] people ah scoring this one and scoring
[1:22:25] that oh did you know this one did this
[1:22:27] and that one did that and don't even
[1:22:29] tell me about it if you want to talk to
[1:22:31] me about something tell me something
[1:22:33] good that somebody did or good
[1:22:37] things that's
[1:22:42] right I'll go ahead and say it I've had
[1:22:45] to shut my phone off on somebody like
[1:22:47] that sent me nothing but negative
[1:22:49] negative I said look you don't quit
[1:22:50] sending me this negative I'm shutting
[1:22:53] you off wouldn't quit it
[1:22:56] B I said I I ask you politely don't do
[1:23:00] it don't do it want to do somebody else
[1:23:03] fine no if you don't like it just don't
[1:23:05] read it no that's not good enough don't
[1:23:06] send it to
[1:23:09] me I said I know how to take care of the
[1:23:12] problem flip the
[1:23:14] switch
[1:23:16] hello and I'm a happy man because of it
[1:23:20] I'm happier because of it I don't need
[1:23:21] that that
[1:23:23] negativity is that
[1:23:25] okay amen all right well hopefully you
[1:23:29] ain't got to do that to nobody but
[1:23:31] anyway listen to this nor sth in the
[1:23:33] seat of the scornful but his Delight is
[1:23:36] in the law of the Lord and in his law do
[1:23:38] he meditate D
[1:23:42] night how many believes we need to do
[1:23:44] more of that you want more God you want
[1:23:47] more of the
[1:23:48] spirit you want more of the effects of

[1:24:13] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[1:24:15] his fruit in his season and his La Leaf
[1:24:18] also shall not wither and whatsoever he
[1:24:21] doeth shall prosper the ungodly not so
[1:24:25] why because they don't meditate on the
[1:24:26] Lord all day and night they don't like
[1:24:28] to do what the God said do
[1:24:31] amen when God told Joshua wherever you

[1:24:41] as I was with Moses so will I be with
[1:24:43] you but this book of the law shall not
[1:24:44] depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt
[1:24:47] meditate there in day and night that
[1:24:49] thou mayest observe to do all that is
[1:24:52] written therein and that thou shalt make
[1:24:55] thine and thou shalt make thy way
[1:24:57] prosperous and then shalt thou have good
