[22:52] put them in fear oh Lord that the
[22:54] nations may know themselves to be put
[22:57] but men Sila God bless you may be seated
[23:00] brother
[23:15] Brian morning brothers and
[23:21] sisters sorry that last thing we read
[23:24] that they would know that they're just
[23:26] men there's nothing special about him
[23:29] humility is a hard thing for the world
[23:31] we live in right now there ain't a lot
[23:33] of humility out there if you would turn
[23:35] with me to uh Ephesians the third
[23:39] chapter you know that one quote this
[23:42] morning that was up there on the board
[23:45] coming out of why Christ Peak talking
[23:47] about the church and you know if you
[23:50] really get a revelation of who you are
[23:52] in Jesus Christ this morning knowing
[23:54] that you are the Living Church you're
[23:56] the Church of God you're the temple
[23:58] temple of God the presence of God abides
[24:01] in your heart and life you can really
[24:03] reach out and grab that Revelation and
[24:05] know who you are in Jesus Christ this
[24:08] morning there there's nothing to worry
[24:10] about the battle's already over you are
[24:13] going to be there on that day and be
[24:16] successful in any of your endeavors you
[24:19] know and I was thinking of the brother
[24:21] from from France from Wednesday do you
[24:24] think he's embarrassed to be a message
[24:27] believer after that
[24:29] what he preached to us through the Lord
[24:31] on Wednesday night you know for a fact
[24:33] that he's not afraid of the message of
[24:35] the hour or the word of God you know
[24:37] that and I was
[24:39] thinking a lot a lot of
[24:42] times we it's not that what fear has
[24:47] nothing to do with I was just thinking
[24:48] of what Paul had to say when when you're
[24:51] dealing with people from denominations
[24:53] and other Christians out there they say
[24:55] you're following a man you believe a
[24:57] false way and all this that shouldn't
[25:00] that shouldn't affect you at all if
[25:02] you've had that
[25:04] Revelation but then when you what you
[25:07] really what I know is I always tell them
[25:09] well you're following a man too you're
[25:11] following the man Jesus Christ and
[25:13] you're following the man Paul because
[25:15] when we read the scriptures it's the
[25:17] revelation of Jesus Christ himself in
[25:20] the gospels and as Paul and the apostles
[25:23] taught it to us in the you know in the
[25:25] end of the Gospel in the Epistles so I'm
[25:28] just going to read what Paul had to say
[25:31] so but they're following a man's
[25:33] teaching also for this is what Paul had
[25:35] to say for this cause I Paul the
[25:38] prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
[25:41] Gentiles so he's identifying who he is
[25:43] right there in the scriptures he's our
[25:45] messenger he's that prophetic Messenger
[25:48] to the first church to to set in order
[25:51] how the church is to be
[25:53] established and you'll deal with people
[25:55] out there in the world and and when you
[25:58] talk about the teachings of Paul what do
[26:00] they do to you well I believe Jesus or I
[26:03] believe what the gospels say well you
[26:05] can't be that way it's all the word of
[26:07] God or it's not and Paul goes on to say
[26:10] here if you've heard of the dispensation
[26:13] of grace of God which is given to me
[26:15] your
[26:16] word I'm getting bad in pronunciations
[26:19] as I get older how that by Revelation he
[26:22] may known unto me the Mysteries as I
[26:24] write a four in few words so he's
[26:27] letting the people know through this
[26:29] word that God gave him a re Revelation
[26:32] that he was going to bring in a gentile
[26:35] church he was going to bring in a
[26:37] gentile bride and he goes on to say here
[26:40] whereby when we read we may understand
[26:42] my knowledge in the mystery of Christ
[26:46] which in other Ages was not main know
[26:49] Unto the Sons of man and as it is now
[26:52] revealed unto His Holy Apostles and
[26:54] Prophets by the spirit so this goes back
[26:57] to what Jesus said said in the gospel he
[26:59] told the the Believers he told the
[27:02] Pharisees that he was going to send
[27:04] Apostles and Prophets and preachers to
[27:07] bring the people into repentance and he
[27:10] and Paul's identifying who he is right
[27:12] here and the Gentiles should be fellow
[27:15] hers of the same body and partakers of
[27:18] his promise in Christ by the
[27:21] gospel like I said I can't go wrong just
[27:23] reading what God's word has to say and
[27:25] then we go to the seventh verse and it
[27:28] says here where whereof I was made a
[27:30] minister according to the gift of grace
[27:33] of God given unto me by the effectual
[27:35] working of his power so Paul it you know
[27:39] was this Messenger to this first age no
[27:42] different than brother Bram was the
[27:44] messenger to the last age this word that
[27:46] we follow the revealed word of the hour
[27:49] and what we're following in the Bible is
[27:51] all God's word and he goes on to say
[27:54] unto me who am less than the least of
[27:56] all the saints is Grace given that I
[27:58] should preach among the Gentiles The
[28:00] unsearchable Riches of Christ so he's
[28:03] saying who he's he's identifying who he
[28:06] is and what he is and to make all men
[28:08] see which is the Fellowship of the
[28:12] mystery which from the beginning of the
[28:14] world has been hidden God who created
[28:18] All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent
[28:21] now onto the principalities and powers
[28:23] in Heavenly places might be known by the
[28:26] church the manifold wisdom of God God so
[28:28] Paul right here in these 21 verses is
[28:32] laying down exactly what he is and who
[28:34] he is in the word of God it doesn't make
[28:37] him anything more than a man just makes
[28:40] him the messenger that God is using to
[28:42] the Gentile church just like brother
[28:44] bram's the messenger to us in the last
[28:46] age of the Gentile church and he goes on
[28:49] to say in whom we have boldness and ask
[28:51] access with confidence by the faith of
[28:54] him wherefore I desire that you faint
[28:57] not at my tribul ations for you which is
[28:59] your glory for this cause I bow my knees
[29:02] unto the father our Lord Jesus Christ
[29:05] and he goes on to say here of whom the
[29:07] whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[29:09] named and that's who we are this morning
[29:12] goes back to that quote this morning
[29:15] really that Revelation nothing will
[29:17] stand before you if you really get the
[29:20] Revelation who Jesus Christ is who and
[29:23] who the word of God speaks to our heart
[29:25] this morning that's what the Christian
[29:27] is is you're the Church of God the world
[29:30] sees Christ through you this morning I
[29:33] mean all the power that it all abides in
[29:36] the word of God and in the presence of
[29:38] Jesus Christ and if that presence in you
[29:41] there's nothing that couldn't stand
[29:42] before you that does it mean everything
[29:44] we do is successful no but we just try
[29:47] harder and harder you know I was reading
[29:50] what brother brandham uh earlier in the
[29:52] week in a quote he said he said if I
[29:55] preach to a 100,000 people or um the
[29:58] numers right I'm paraphrasing but let's
[30:01] say he preached to a thousand people
[30:03] Divine Healing and those thousand people
[30:05] died he would still preach Divine
[30:07] Healing the next day and believe the
[30:09] word of God so it's not the evidence of
[30:12] what you see but it's the word of God
[30:15] above all things and he go I lost my
[30:17] place here therefore I desire that you
[30:20] faint not at my tribulation for you
[30:22] which is your glory for this cause I bow
[30:25] my knees onto the father of our Lord
[30:27] Jesus Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[30:29] family in Heaven and Earth is name that
[30:32] he would Grant you according to the
[30:34] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[30:36] with the might by a spirit in the inner
[30:39] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[30:42] by faith and it goes what I'm saying
[30:44] here this morning everything is by faith
[30:46] in Jesus Christ this morning it goes
[30:48] that one scripture we're reading the
[30:50] first uh you know John 1:1 in the
[30:53] beginning you know in the beginning and
[30:55] it all begins in the beginning
[30:58] in Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[31:00] faith that you be being rooted and
[31:02] grounded in love may be able to
[31:04] comprehend with All Saints which is the
[31:07] breadth and the length and the depth and
[31:08] the height and to know the love of
[31:11] Christ and which passes knowledge that
[31:15] you might be filled with all the
[31:17] fullness of
[31:18] God and know unto him that is able to do
[31:22] exceedingly abundantly above all that
[31:24] you ask or think according to the power
[31:26] that worketh in him unto him be glory in
[31:29] the church by Jesus Christ throughout
[31:32] all ages of the world without Amen Let
[31:35] me just I don't have a lot more to say I
[31:38] know I say that a lot but I was uh also
[31:41] reading something this
[31:45] morning and the world we live is such a
[31:48] fragile place this morning and it's
[31:51] really important for us as Christians
[31:52] this morning to hold on to the word of
[31:54] God and that presence we have in our
[31:57] hearts and lives that comes through
[31:58] salvation because everything we see
[32:01] today it could be gone tomorrow and the
[32:03] only thing that'll be there the next day
[32:06] when everything is gone is your
[32:07] relationship with Jesus Christ and I I
[32:10] was just thinking of the world that we
[32:11] live in especially in
[32:13] America people that have never traveled
[32:16] outside this
[32:18] country it strikes me that they think
[32:21] they can make a better way but
[32:23] everything they're trying this morning
[32:25] doesn't make a better way it just brings
[32:27] more suffering more just brings more
[32:31] problems than it changes anything but I
[32:33] was also thinking for us this morning I
[32:37] I read the other thing that I heard this
[32:38] morning I'm going to sit down here is
[32:41] that you have to have
[32:44] confidence in your relationship with you
[32:46] have to have confidence in your pastor
[32:48] you have to have confidence in your
[32:50] salvation and you have to have
[32:52] confidence in the word of God you have
[32:54] to have all those things this morning to
[32:57] be successful
[32:58] and the whole purpose of your your enemy
[33:01] is going to do everything he can to
[33:04] spoil that relationship that you have
[33:06] this morning he's doing everything he
[33:08] can to make you see something's wrong
[33:11] here something's wrong there this ain't
[33:13] right here this ain't right here that's
[33:16] his whole purpose out there is to get
[33:18] you off the mark and as the what I'm
[33:21] trying to say is you have to I know for
[33:23] myself you have to struggle each day to
[33:26] just stay on the path this morning God
[33:29] is looking for Christians this morning I
[33:31] believe no matter what the world says
[33:34] what the world
[33:35] does they're going to follow the truth
[33:37] of the hour they're not going to be
[33:39] swayed either way I don't know I was
[33:41] having I don't know not a flashback or
[33:44] anything I was thinking the people in
[33:46] the in our um country they're they're
[33:49] wanting the government to get give them
[33:51] everything and take care of everything
[33:52] and I was just thinking this morning
[33:54] well you know I've been to countries in
[33:56] the world that have tried that type of
[33:59] lifestyle and it's not a pretty sight
[34:01] after it happens so I was just thinking
[34:04] this morning it's better just to trust
[34:06] the Lord and whatever happens is going
[34:08] to happen but for you as the believer
[34:11] this
[34:12] morning you've already one there's
[34:14] nothing to worry about Brother
[34:26] David of the Lord this
[34:28] morning amen I I was thinking as brother
[34:31] Brian was speaking and you know the
[34:34] world is falling apart this morning and
[34:37] we see it more day by day but thought
[34:40] the only real peace that I have this
[34:41] morning is in you Lord let's stand and
[34:43] sing that little chorus if we could this
[34:46] morning amen oh the

[1:06:35] seats brother Brown said I've I've often
[1:06:38] said
[1:06:42] this he said you be
[1:06:48] salty and the Earth will be
[1:06:53] thirsty he said you're the salt
[1:06:57] of the
[1:07:00] earth such a presence here today you're
[1:07:04] the
[1:07:06] salt you and the Earth will be thirsty
[1:07:09] you're the salt of the earth you just
[1:07:11] get salty and the Earth will get thirsty
[1:07:16] he said you live in such a way in the
[1:07:18] neighborhood and the people around you
[1:07:20] and the people you know and they'll say
[1:07:22] there's a real
[1:07:24] Christian I tell you that he said if
[1:07:27] there ever was a Christian there she is
[1:07:30] or there he is
[1:07:34] am
[1:07:36] salty Carson would you bring up The
[1:07:38] Message Bible version of that scripture
[1:07:41] for
[1:07:42] me it's a little different he had to
[1:07:44] search for it but this is The Message
[1:07:46] Bible when I say that it's not the the
[1:07:48] Bible written by anybody in the message
[1:07:51] it's a translation of the Bible but as I
[1:07:53] looked at it and I got to thinking about
[1:07:55] it and I want you you to look at the way
[1:07:56] it reads in this time it says let me
[1:07:59] tell you why you are
[1:08:01] here he says you're here to be salt
[1:08:04] seasoning that brings out the god
[1:08:08] flavors of this Earth if you lose your
[1:08:12] saltiness how will people taste
[1:08:16] godliness he says you've lost your
[1:08:19] usefulness and you'll end up in the
[1:08:21] garbage
[1:08:25] hold right there for now anybody that
[1:08:28] knows me knows that I love
[1:08:32] salt I salt
[1:08:36] salt I keep a little thing of Salt by my
[1:08:40] in my kitchen in the morning I grab a
[1:08:42] pinch of salt put it in my mouth when I
[1:08:44] go to bed yeah I love
[1:08:48] salt it's
[1:08:51] Savory when I go to bed at night I grab
[1:08:53] a pinch of salt and put it in my mouth
[1:08:55] go to to bed with it in my mouth
[1:08:56] sleeping you say man your blood pressure
[1:08:58] must be out the roof checked it the
[1:09:01] other day 120 over 72 I'll take that
[1:09:03] every
[1:09:05] day because it's not the salt that
[1:09:08] raises up now I'm not a doctor nor do I
[1:09:10] play one on
[1:09:13] TV but table salt is different than
[1:09:17] natural
[1:09:18] salt and the Bible the word here is
[1:09:21] talking about the salt if the salt has
[1:09:24] lost its savor so what is it the
[1:09:26] difference is table salt has had all of
[1:09:29] the mineral all of the god flavors
[1:09:32] pulled out of it it's different than
[1:09:35] natural salt it's got iodine added into
[1:09:37] it but you take the natural salt Celtic
[1:09:41] Sea salt has 92 minerals and elements in
[1:09:45] it that is Savory for the body and that
[1:09:48] is what we're talking about here is
[1:09:50] adding God's
[1:09:53] flavors when you're salty
[1:09:55] with the savoring salt of God you then
[1:09:59] begin to put out life you begin to put
[1:10:01] out love you put out joy you put out
[1:10:03] peace you put out longsuffering you put
[1:10:06] out forgiveness for your brothers and
[1:10:08] sisters and forgiveness for The
[1:10:13] Sinner you'll begin to draw people
[1:10:15] because they flavor they see the flavor
[1:10:18] in your life and they see something
[1:10:19] different about you pull up the rest of
[1:10:21] the scripture
[1:10:24] Carson he here's another way to put it
[1:10:27] you're here to be a light bringing out
[1:10:29] the god Colors Of The
[1:10:36] World God is not a secret to be kept
[1:10:40] watch's this what's it say next we're
[1:10:42] going public with
[1:10:45] this so many times we pull into our
[1:10:47] little shelves we pull into our little
[1:10:49] worlds and we say oh my goodness I'm a
[1:10:52] Christian but look at everybody else
[1:10:55] I believe the message but look at all
[1:10:57] these other
[1:10:58] people we're going public with this
[1:11:02] we're going public with this and he says
[1:11:06] as as as public as a city on a hill if I
[1:11:09] make you lightbearers you don't think
[1:11:11] I'm going to hide you under a bucket do
[1:11:16] you if God has done something in your
[1:11:19] life and he is so proud and so so
[1:11:21] honored by the life that you're living
[1:11:23] because you're living the life of a
[1:11:24] Christian
[1:11:27] you think he's going to hide
[1:11:29] you no we hide
[1:11:32] ourselves we get afraid we get full of
[1:11:35] fear we get full of anxiety we don't put
[1:11:37] ourselves out there but the word says in
[1:11:39] this translation we're going
[1:11:42] public we're taking this message public
[1:11:44] we're taking the word of God
[1:11:48] public I'm going to put you on a Hilltop
[1:11:51] I'm going to put you on a lightstand
[1:11:53] shine keep open High house be generous
[1:11:56] with your
[1:11:57] lives by opening up to others you'll
[1:12:00] prompt people to open up with God the
[1:12:04] generous Father in
[1:12:09] heaven so brothers and sisters often
[1:12:11] times we think man we're
[1:12:13] marked we're
[1:12:15] branded that little that little church
[1:12:17] out there on Taylor's Road or whatever
[1:12:18] it is Taylor's Chapel Hill they're
[1:12:21] branded they're
[1:12:22] marked they're marked in the community
[1:12:25] but but I want to ask you what is it
[1:12:26] that the people's eyes have on us that
[1:12:30] we're
[1:12:32] different
[1:12:34] okay we may be different we are but
[1:12:38] there's no shame in being different
[1:12:40] there's no shame in being different but
[1:12:42] let me ask you what are we known for you
[1:12:46] see today's message it it may Shake us
[1:12:48] up a little bit and that's okay we can
[1:12:51] stand to be shook a little bit but I
[1:12:53] want you to know is what God want you to
[1:12:55] be I want to be what God wants me to be
[1:12:59] and God Jesus said to be the salt and
[1:13:01] the
[1:13:03] light be the salt and be the light
[1:13:05] because salt makes things better with
[1:13:07] flavor and the light makes things
[1:13:10] brighter with colors the salt and the
[1:13:13] light so any of you that may be familiar
[1:13:16] with John Maxwell and his

[1:13:58] of thousands of services preached in the
[1:14:00] next year two years on Jesus the high
[1:14:03] road
[1:14:05] leader you remember the the prayer of J
[1:14:07] Bez Brook W Bruce Wilkinson how many
[1:14:10] messages was preached on the prayer of
[1:14:12] JZ this will overtake that and I'm not
[1:14:14] doing that to lift him up or put
[1:14:15] anything but I got a copy of this book
[1:14:18] and and I began to look at it and I
[1:14:19] began to read it because it was you
[1:14:22] could only buy it there I thought I got
[1:14:23] to have it can't nobody else read it I'm
[1:14:24] going to read it so I got it on my way
[1:14:27] home and I began to read at the airports
[1:14:29] and on the and on the uh airplanes and
[1:14:32] in this book he talks about and he
[1:14:34] describes three paths that we can walk
[1:14:36] in life he says there's a a low
[1:14:40] road and in that low road people on this
[1:14:43] road are
[1:14:44] selfishly
[1:14:46] motivated they they they take more than
[1:14:49] they
[1:14:50] give and as a result instead of making
[1:14:52] the world better and brighter they make
[1:14:54] the world worse worse and
[1:14:57] darker how many times have we seen
[1:14:59] people walking the low road in life they
[1:15:02] want they want they want they want they
[1:15:04] take they take they take they take we
[1:15:06] see it in church you see it in your
[1:15:08] families you see it you see it
[1:15:10] everywhere in politics in the culture
[1:15:13] Won Won Won take take take can't give
[1:15:17] nothing that's the low road and he says
[1:15:21] there is a Middle Road and on this
[1:15:23] Middle Road he said people on this road
[1:15:25] focus on fairness and they often keep
[1:15:29] score you know you you got scorekeepers
[1:15:32] right sometimes we keep score you know
[1:15:34] brother so and so done this and I tell
[1:15:36] you I remember when and and he you
[1:15:39] that's keeping
[1:15:40] score that's keeping
[1:15:42] score and I I tell you today that we
[1:15:45] can't keep score because none of us are
[1:15:46] going to win if we keep
[1:15:48] score don't be a
[1:15:52] scorekeeper but these people keep scor
[1:15:55] for and and they maintain their status
[1:15:58] quo there's there's nothing that gets
[1:16:00] better and there's nothing that gets
[1:16:02] brighter and this is the people I think
[1:16:04] has to be we have to be aware of and be
[1:16:06] careful of because in Le
[1:16:09] oosa in leosa age that we're living in
[1:16:13] we can see it right there because God
[1:16:14] said you're neither hot you're neither
[1:16:16] cold you're lukewarm and I'm going to
[1:16:18] spew you out of my
[1:16:20] mouth so let me read this little
[1:16:22] translation to you and this is God
[1:16:23] speaking about Le out of see you and he
[1:16:26] says I know you inside and
[1:16:30] out that can be
[1:16:34] scary I know you inside and out and I
[1:16:37] find little to my
[1:16:41] liking the Church of Le oosa you're not
[1:16:44] cold you're not hot far better for it to
[1:16:47] be either cold or hot you're
[1:16:51] stale you're
[1:16:53] stagnant you make me want to
[1:16:57] vomit that's harsh
[1:16:59] words coming from our God you make me
[1:17:03] want to vomit you brag I'm rich I've got
[1:17:08] it made I need nothing from
[1:17:12] anyone but obviously You're
[1:17:16] Pitiful You're Pitiful you're blind
[1:17:19] you're a beggar you're threadbear and
[1:17:22] you're homeless
[1:17:24] now they may have the finest of
[1:17:27] riches and think they don't need nothing
[1:17:29] here in this world but they're homeless
[1:17:31] in the Kingdom of God in the in the
[1:17:34] Kingdom of Heaven they find themselves
[1:17:36] homeless let me tell you I'm not worried
[1:17:38] about this home down here I'm worried
[1:17:41] about my heavenly home that's where I
[1:17:43] want to be so God help me not to be
[1:17:45] stale God help me not to be stagnant God
[1:17:48] help me to be on fire with all that's
[1:17:51] within me
[1:17:55] Jesus wants us all to follow him
[1:17:57] wholeheartedly on this high road so what
[1:18:01] is this High Road the high road it's
[1:18:04] people on this road they follow Jesus
[1:18:07] they follow Jesus's example they give
[1:18:09] more than they
[1:18:17] take I'm I'm I'm check something here
[1:18:21] they give more than they take
[1:18:25] they serve others out of
[1:18:28] love you know it's one thing to serve
[1:18:31] somebody out of
[1:18:33] obligation is completely different to
[1:18:36] serve somebody out of
[1:18:39] love that neighbor that that kicked your
[1:18:41] dog last
[1:18:44] week needs his mailbox put back
[1:18:48] up and you do it out of love not out of
[1:18:52] obligation you getting somewhere
[1:18:58] they turn the other cheek instead of
[1:19:00] making a
[1:19:01] fence they reflect the behavior that
[1:19:04] Jesus had and because they do these
[1:19:06] things they make the world a better
[1:19:09] brighter
[1:19:11] place that's the high road leader
[1:19:13] brothers and sisters that's the life
[1:19:15] that Jesus lived that's the life he
[1:19:17] lived before people and who were the
[1:19:19] people that followed Jesus they were
[1:19:23] common ordinary people that wanted to
[1:19:26] follow
[1:19:28] him not the
[1:19:30] popular not the dignitary not the
[1:19:33] religious leaders not those who were
[1:19:36] rich not the higher ups let me take it a
[1:19:39] step further where Jesus walked the poor
[1:19:43] followed where Jesus walked the sick
[1:19:47] followed where Jesus walked the lame
[1:19:50] followed the drunkard followed the
[1:19:52] Harlot followed the addict followed
[1:19:57] that's where Jesus walked and he walked
[1:19:59] a high road and we would be ashamed to
[1:20:01] walk on that road many times if these
[1:20:03] people followed us if we walked down the
[1:20:04] road and a prostitute was following us
[1:20:07] and a drug addict was behind her and
[1:20:10] there was a drunkard following along
[1:20:12] give me he here give me give
[1:20:14] me we would be ashamed we would run get
[1:20:18] out of here get away from me don't look
[1:20:21] at me so Pi you know you would
[1:20:25] after today I hope we
[1:20:28] don't but if these people were following
[1:20:31] you why were they following him why did
[1:20:35] the maniac of gadera follow
[1:20:38] him this Maniac was living up in the
[1:20:40] cemeteries this man was a
[1:20:44] beast
[1:20:46] suicidal cutting himself that's what
[1:20:50] that's what it that's what it is he's
[1:20:51] suicidal he's a
[1:20:52] cutter and he's cutting him himself he's
[1:20:55] a beast he was known to be
[1:20:58] howling and crying this guy was was
[1:21:04] unbearable and he follows
[1:21:08] Jesus you know the word uh scholars
[1:21:11] believe and they think they they type
[1:21:13] the G the maniac and when I I read this
[1:21:15] in in another documentary somewhere but
[1:21:17] they type him and they say he's the
[1:21:19] first Apostle of the Gentiles
[1:21:24] think about
[1:21:26] that that could be you or
[1:21:29] me that could be us with depressive
[1:21:32] thoughts there's people that have had
[1:21:34] Suicidal Thoughts there are people that
[1:21:36] get
[1:21:38] deranged but this man here has now
[1:21:40] become the first Apostle of the Gentiles
[1:21:43] and now he's following Jesus teaching
[1:21:46] Jesus took it back to his neighborhood
[1:21:48] and said let me tell you about a man
[1:21:49] that walks on the high road
[1:21:57] yeah let me tell you about a man who
[1:21:58] walks on the high
[1:22:01] road so are you walking on the high road

[1:27:08] this this is the greatest thing and am I
[1:27:11] denying it no am I playing it down
[1:27:15] no it
[1:27:19] is turn with me to John 13
[1:27:27] you see Jesus valued all people just
[1:27:30] hold your place there in in in John
[1:27:32] 13 Jesus valued all
[1:27:35] people but let me ask you this are you
[1:27:38] doing what Jesus
[1:27:42] did I've preached on it before that
[1:27:44] bracelet that used to go around and it's
[1:27:46] what would Jesus do right wwjd what
[1:27:49] would Jesus do and everybody had to wear
[1:27:51] it everybody had it it was everybody had
[1:27:53] it well Maxwell being a little bit more
[1:27:56] clever than the thought he said instead
[1:27:58] of what would Jesus do why don't we
[1:28:00] change it and say do what Jesus
[1:28:05] did so he gave out bracelets to all
[1:28:08] 33500 people that was in the auditorium
[1:28:11] the other
[1:28:14] night do what Jesus
[1:28:17] did you see Jesus gave more than he
[1:28:20] received do
[1:28:23] you Jesus didn't keep score it's a good
[1:28:26] thing Jesus didn't keep score because
[1:28:28] Peter was a
[1:28:29] scorekeeper SK Peter was a SC a
[1:28:32] scorekeeper how'd that work out for
[1:28:35] him it didn't work out too good for
[1:28:37] Peter because Jesus come to him and he
[1:28:39] told him Peter before morning the before
[1:28:42] the crows in the morning you're
[1:28:44] going to deny me three times
[1:28:48] Peter

[1:29:28] have lost I have miserably failed the
[1:29:30] Lord and now here they're going to hang
[1:29:33] him on a cross and now here I am I've
[1:29:35] lost in the game of
[1:29:38] life I'm going to go back to
[1:29:41] fishing that's what he did do you
[1:29:43] realize that he walked away from
[1:29:45] everything he saw Jesus in the life of
[1:29:48] Jesus and in the ministry of Jesus he
[1:29:51] turns around and walks back to the
[1:29:53] fishing hole
[1:29:59] thank God for
[1:30:02] Jesus he says I I I'm a loser I've kept
[1:30:06] score in life and I'm a loser but Jesus
[1:30:08] says no you're not a loser you're a rock
[1:30:12] Peter and he goes to the Sea and he
[1:30:15] finds Jesus and says pet he finds Peter
[1:30:18] and Jesus says Peter come

[1:30:52] church Jesus knew what it was to be
[1:30:55] human Jesus was right for the right
[1:30:58] reasons Jesus lived an authentic life
[1:31:01] Jesus placed others first Jesus brought
[1:31:04] people together Jesus loved
[1:31:10] people how do I know that I'm truly
[1:31:13] following Jesus how do you know ask the
[1:31:15] question right how do I fully know that
[1:31:18] I'm following
[1:31:20] Jesus John 1331
[1:31:25] therefore when he was gone out Jesus
[1:31:28] said now is this is the son of man
[1:31:30] glorified and God is glorified in
[1:31:34] him if God be glorified in him shall God

[1:34:46] life that's what a disciple is
[1:34:50] right and at all of this time he knows
[1:34:53] that the cross is awaiting his
[1:34:56] arrival he knows that there is a hungry
[1:34:59] cross ready to take his lives his life
[1:35:02] and these are the words of wisdom that
[1:35:04] he gives out love one
[1:35:08] another he's fixing to die the most
[1:35:10] horrible brutal cruel death any man has
[1:35:14] ever seen in the entire world then now
[1:35:18] or
[1:35:20] ever you can't compare it there is no no
[1:35:23] torture no no uh uh uh no matter of of
[1:35:27] torture or event that could be even
[1:35:29] compared to what Jesus went through or
[1:35:31] ever will
[1:35:33] be but he gives this wisdom to his
[1:35:35] disciples love
[1:35:38] people cherish people value people so
[1:35:42] you mean we're not supposed to draw
[1:35:45] lines between people we're not supposed
[1:35:48] to to debate over this scripture or
[1:35:50] debate over this quote or build walls
[1:35:52] between this church church and that
[1:35:54] church and this group and that group or
[1:35:57] this man and that
[1:35:59] centner or this Christian and and and
[1:36:02] the woman at the store
[1:36:06] clerk the woman at
[1:36:14] Walmart you say I'm going to need a
[1:36:16] quote for this where you're going I got
[1:36:18] to have a quote well you're in luck cuz
[1:36:19] I happen to have one
[1:36:26] I want you to listen to this and listen
[1:36:27] close I'm going to try to get through it
[1:36:30] this quote here is what got me so so
[1:36:33] emotionally wound up this
[1:36:35] morning I'm so grateful tonight to the
[1:36:38] Lord Jesus for what he's let me do for
[1:36:40] his
[1:36:41] people I love
[1:36:45] people God knows that and he goes on to
[1:36:49] talk about how he can't be with
[1:36:50] everybody because he's studying the
[1:36:52] message he's studying the word he's
[1:36:53] trying to get a message ready for the
[1:36:54] people and he can't be out there like he
[1:36:57] wants to be and he says some people he's
[1:36:58] talking about they kind of criticize him
[1:37:00] he said but people don't understand it
[1:37:02] they don't know until we cross that
[1:37:04] River but love real true love I love
[1:37:12] people he says when I was a little boy
[1:37:14] raised up in a in in a home not too good
[1:37:17] a
[1:37:18] family and nobody seemed to care for me
[1:37:22] and in my own family many of my brothers
[1:37:24] they would drink they smoke they they
[1:37:26] did things that I didn't do I was the
[1:37:28] black sheep of the
[1:37:29] family but I found out someday that
[1:37:33] somebody really loved
[1:37:36] me he said somebody let me know that
[1:37:39] Jesus loved
[1:37:43] me you see we don't know what people are
[1:37:45] going through you don't know the
[1:37:48] hardships you don't know the trials the
[1:37:50] struggles the pain all sometimes we see
[1:37:52] is a smile in face a successful
[1:37:55] businessman but you don't know the loss
[1:37:58] maybe of a loved one a child a wife a
[1:38:02] husband you don't know the split that
[1:38:05] went on in the church you don't know the
[1:38:07] things the preacher that mistreated
[1:38:10] them the Deacon the song leader say it
[1:38:13] whatever you
[1:38:15] want you don't know what's going on in
[1:38:17] their lives but he said let me tell you
[1:38:19] Jesus loved
[1:38:21] me and I thought to myself s you mean
[1:38:24] the very highest of all
[1:38:27] high the ve the god of Heaven Loves
[1:38:31] Me This is the prophet
[1:38:34] talking do you see what a revelation of
[1:38:37] Love began to work in his life as a
[1:38:39] young person he said the first time I
[1:38:41] ever prayed I couldn't pray he said you
[1:38:44] know what my first prayer was he said I
[1:38:46] was a hunter and I lived back in the
[1:38:47] woods and I said I'm gonna write my
[1:38:49] prayer out on a piece of paper and Tack
[1:38:50] it on a tree in the woods and then and
[1:38:53] then I'd know he'd come down that path
[1:38:55] sometime and he would read it and
[1:38:57] forgive
[1:38:59] me
[1:39:01] wow he said I I wrote it out on a piece
[1:39:04] of paper and I got to thinking wow they
[1:39:07] told me he was a man and if he's a man
[1:39:10] then he will understand as a man aren't
[1:39:13] you thankful that God looks at our lives
[1:39:16] and says I understand what you're going
[1:39:18] through I understand the challenges
[1:39:21] you're facing I understand the hardships
[1:39:24] and the pain and the hurts that you've
[1:39:25] been through I
[1:39:30] understand and he said so I went out to
[1:39:32] the shed and it was real wet and I got a
[1:39:35] sack and I knelt down I can only imagine
[1:39:37] a feed sack and he said I knelt down and
[1:39:41] I heard people say God talk to me he
[1:39:45] said well I said now how must that how
[1:39:47] must I do that how how must I hold my
[1:39:49] hands what do I do how do I do it I
[1:39:51] didn't know how to do it well I seen a
[1:39:53] picture one time like this with somebody
[1:39:55] praying with their hands like this and I
[1:39:57] got my hands like this and this is where
[1:40:00] it got me I said Dear
[1:40:03] Sir Mr
[1:40:07] Jesus Mr
[1:40:11] Jesus Mr Jesus I wish to speak to you
[1:40:14] for a
[1:40:16] minute I wish to speak to you for a
[1:40:18] minute would you come up here for a
[1:40:20] minute I want to speak to you for a
[1:40:22] minute I don't hear you where are you
[1:40:26] at where are you at I want to speak to
[1:40:29] you maybe I didn't hold my hands
[1:40:32] right he said maybe I should have
[1:40:34] crossed my
[1:40:37] fingers maybe I should have crossed my
[1:40:39] fingers so I crossed my hands and I said
[1:40:41] Mr Jesus if I don't cross my hands right
[1:40:44] or whatever I'm doing wrong will you
[1:40:45] forgive me he said because I don't mean
[1:40:48] to do it in the wrong way but if you
[1:40:51] come here for just a minute I want to
[1:40:52] talk to you a little
[1:40:54] bit you talk about a
[1:41:02] love he said now that's how much I know
[1:41:06] about God right
[1:41:07] there when I loved him he said you know
[1:41:11] I've been so mean I won't even he won't
[1:41:14] even talk to me and I guess I'm lost for
[1:41:17] good then and I started crying and I
[1:41:19] said well sir I'm going to confess my
[1:41:22] sins any he said I'm no
[1:41:25] good and I said you are all
[1:41:28] good you are all good but when I was
[1:41:32] dying there in that hospital I told you
[1:41:34] I would talk it over with you and this
[1:41:35] is all I can do and he said about that
[1:41:38] time a little light circled it came
[1:41:42] across he said a and a cross Came Upon
[1:41:45] the wall and he said my sins
[1:41:48] left when love had been projected
[1:41:53] and Sovereign Grace took its
[1:42:02] place when love had been projected and
[1:42:05] Sovereign Grace took its place he said
[1:42:08] it's answered it's really
[1:42:11] love and that's all you have to do love
[1:42:15] the Lord with all my heart with all my
[1:42:17] mind with all my strength and and it'll
[1:42:19] work with any human
[1:42:24] by
[1:42:25] this shall all man know that you are my
[1:42:31] disciples if you'll love one
[1:42:37] another you see Jesus valued all people
[1:42:40] in
[1:42:41] life John
[1:42:45] 3:16 for God so loved the world that he
[1:42:47] gave his only begotten son that
[1:42:48] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:42:50] perish but have everlasting life
[1:42:54] for God sent not his son into the world
[1:42:56] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:42:58] through him might be
[1:43:01] saved do you have that
[1:43:05] Carson let's listen to it in the message
[1:43:10] version this is how much God loved the
[1:43:13] world he gave his son his one and only
[1:43:16] son and this is why so that no one need
[1:43:20] be destroyed
[1:43:25] how guilty are we at times of destroying
[1:43:29] people look at their life look at the
[1:43:31] way they live look at look at the way
[1:43:33] they talk look at the way they walk look
[1:43:34] at the way they they do this and they do
[1:43:36] that and we begin to destroy and we cut
[1:43:38] and we tear and we
[1:43:40] pull let's don't be that
[1:43:46] person by believing in him anyone can
[1:43:48] have a whole and Lasting life I like
[1:43:51] this part God didn't go to all the
[1:43:54] trouble of sending his son merely to
[1:43:57] point out an an accusing finger and
[1:44:00] telling the world how bad it was but he
[1:44:03] came to help to put the world right
[1:44:09] again so when John here is saying that
[1:44:11] Jesus loved the world he was making it
[1:44:13] clear that God loves and values people
[1:44:18] so God was always pulling for the
[1:44:20] underdog God is always pulling on the
[1:44:23] Outsider he's trying to get the person
[1:44:25] that nobody else wants he's looking for
[1:44:27] the one that's overlooked and he's
[1:44:30] looking for the ones that he could see
[1:44:31] the potential in and the people around
[1:44:34] him had very little to offer think about
[1:44:37] it Jesus saw fishermen As
[1:44:41] Leaders when he saw
[1:44:46] zakus he saw a
[1:44:50] giver everyone else saw a taker
[1:44:54] yeah let's think about this for a minute
[1:44:56] here's zakus one of the head tax
[1:44:58] collectors in all the region of
[1:45:00] Jericho this person is not very well
[1:45:03] liked but the Bible says he was a rich
[1:45:06] man as a tax collector he was scorned by
[1:45:09] his countrymen for a couple of reasons
[1:45:12] one of them was he was known for
[1:45:13] cheating the
[1:45:15] taxpayers well I than you
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:19] oh 10 12%
[1:45:25] 10 went to Rome two went to
[1:45:31] Zach so he's known to be a
[1:45:34] cheater and number two he was known to
[1:45:37] work for
[1:45:39] Rome if Rome was ruling over you do you
[1:45:41] really like people that is working and
[1:45:43] helping and pushing and allowing Rome to
[1:45:45] gain more over you no so his fellow men
[1:45:49] the Jews they didn't like him because he
[1:45:51] was a collaborator with the enemy a
[1:45:53] traitor to his own people this is
[1:45:58] zakus but zakus wanted to see the Lord
[1:46:01] as he passed through the
[1:46:02] town I could have any of you Sunday
[1:46:04] school kids come up here and tell me the
[1:46:06] story zakus a wee little man and he
[1:46:10] climbs up into that sycamore tree and
[1:46:11] he's up there in that sycamore tree just
[1:46:13] wanting to get a glimpse of the star
[1:46:15] wanting to get a glimpse of of of of the
[1:46:17] man of the
[1:46:19] hour that's the way I was at the Maxwell

[1:46:28] was at a conference for leadership and
[1:46:30] training and so forth and he's speaking

[1:48:48] chair here yep no
[1:48:50] problem Lord bless you
[1:48:56] and Maxwell begins to preach the
[1:48:59] most simple but Dynamic message I think
[1:49:02] I've ever heard on Jesus the high road
[1:49:08] leader out of 4,000 people he made an
[1:49:11] altar call I thought this could get
[1:49:14] interesting 350 to 400 people lined up
[1:49:18] to give their heart to the
[1:49:21] Lord I told my wife wife I said you know
[1:49:23] what I I struggle with that and you're
[1:49:25] going to know where I'm going with this
[1:49:27] I struggle with that did they just come
[1:49:28] up and give a confession and get the
[1:49:30] free Bible he gave them in the book and
[1:49:32] are they going to go out and do whatever
[1:49:33] they do from here on out or was there
[1:49:35] really a true confession and a change to
[1:49:37] take
[1:49:39] place and then I come to the
[1:49:41] reality that's not my
[1:49:46] business something spoke to their heart
[1:49:49] at least to move them in front of a
[1:49:50] crowd of 3,000 4,000 people to come down
[1:49:53] and say I want
[1:49:57] Jesus it's not up to me just know that
[1:50:00] they've got the seals the the the
[1:50:02] revelation of the of the church agent
[1:50:04] that's not up to me to decide God will
[1:50:07] place it in
[1:50:09] there but here's zakus up in this tree
[1:50:12] and he's looking down there and he's
[1:50:14] he's wanting a glimpse of
[1:50:15] this and he's walking there and he's
[1:50:17] thinking nobody knows I'm up here nobody
[1:50:20] knows I'm here and Jesus looks up
[1:50:25] zakus get down
[1:50:29] here get down
[1:50:32] here
[1:50:34] me you know
[1:50:36] me yeah I know who you
[1:50:39] are I know you're a
[1:50:41] cheater I know you're a
[1:50:44] scoundrel I know you work for the other
[1:50:48] side I know you're a liar I know you're
[1:50:51] an enemy to your people I know all these
[1:50:54] things and here's zachus he's Overjoyed
[1:50:57] but the crowd is
[1:50:59] grumbling how could Jesus pick this
[1:51:04] guy how could Jesus pick this
[1:51:08] guy the worst that we know who's cheated
[1:51:12] everyone here how could he call him out
[1:51:16] because Jesus saw the
[1:51:19] potential Jesus didn't see a taker
[1:51:23] he saw a giver what did zakus do when he
[1:51:26] started following he said Lord I'm rich
[1:51:29] and I've been you I I I've got more than
[1:51:31] I need so I'm going to give away half of
[1:51:33] all that I've got and Lord I hadn't
[1:51:35] always been the most honest
[1:51:37] person and for anybody that I've cheated
[1:51:40] I'm gonna give them F four times as much
[1:51:46] back they saw a taker God saw a giver
[1:51:54] see Jesus Through The Eyes Of
[1:51:56] Love he looked and he could see that
[1:51:59] Lazarus was a living man not a dead man
[1:52:03] Through The Eyes Of Love he can look at
[1:52:05] a Samaritan woman and know you've got
[1:52:09] value and Jesus as he come down there
[1:52:11] and he had began to have this
[1:52:13] conversation with the Samaritan woman
[1:52:15] who'd come to get water from the well
[1:52:17] all by
[1:52:19] herself this is this is an extraordinary
[1:52:21] scene
[1:52:22] the the time to get water to fill the
[1:52:24] pictures is a big time deal for the
[1:52:26] women over there it's when all the women
[1:52:28] get together and they they have their

[1:53:05] God who by Jewish culture should have no
[1:53:08] part whatsoever with this
[1:53:11] woman the Samaritans were
[1:53:15] hated and here as Jesus begins to sit
[1:53:17] down and talk to
[1:53:19] her a woman who during iCal times she
[1:53:24] was scrutinized she was ostracized she
[1:53:27] was marked as being immoral an unmarried
[1:53:29] woman living openly with the sixth in a
[1:53:32] series of
[1:53:36] men and here she says talking to my
[1:53:40] Lord
[1:53:42] privately what would we
[1:53:45] think that hits home don't it what would
[1:53:48] we
[1:53:49] think and here she is talking and and
[1:53:52] Jesus begins to to
[1:53:54] teach and Jesus begins to talk to her
[1:53:57] and Jesus tells us that God loves us in
[1:54:00] spite of our bankrupt
[1:54:02] lives did you hear what I said in spite
[1:54:04] of your bankrupt
[1:54:06] life when you got no friends you got no
[1:54:10] family you got no love you got no joy

[1:54:22] bankrupt life because you've got so much
[1:54:26] to
[1:54:31] offer what does this say for us what
[1:54:34] does this say for us as Believers it

[1:54:43] yourself I'm the only honest one thank
[1:54:45] you brother John appreciate that sure we
[1:54:48] do we love
[1:54:50] ourselves because in our own eyes we
[1:54:53] have
[1:54:54] value and God loves us more than what we
[1:54:57] could value oursel but the better
[1:55:00] question to ask today is how do you
[1:55:02] value other people what what what do you
[1:55:05] do with to The Sinner what do you do to
[1:55:08] the non-religious how do you value
[1:55:10] people you don't even
[1:55:12] know how do you put value on people that
[1:55:15] you don't
[1:55:16] know the answer is because God values
[1:55:19] them you should value them
[1:55:25] listen this leaving therefore leaving
[1:55:27] behind I want everything to be based
[1:55:30] upon the word of God and as you realize
[1:55:31] tonight what a responsibility it is to
[1:55:34] be a Christian minister who stands
[1:55:37] before an audience when each soul is
[1:55:40] valued at the value of
[1:55:43] 10,000
[1:55:45] worlds now you've heard that all your
[1:55:48] life but let that sink in
[1:55:52] The
[1:55:53] Sinner the drug addict the
[1:55:56] alcoholic The
[1:56:00] Prostitute you mean their soul is worth
[1:56:04] 10,000
[1:56:06] worlds so he says as a minister I
[1:56:09] approach any subject and because it's a
[1:56:12] vital thing for today but let me ask you
[1:56:14] if that's for the minister what about
[1:56:16] your
[1:56:18] ministry what about you as you go out
[1:56:21] into the workplace
[1:56:22] what about you what about when you're
[1:56:24] ministering at Walmart when you're
[1:56:26] ministering at the school when you're
[1:56:27] ministering at work when you're
[1:56:29] ministering wherever you're at when
[1:56:30] you're just walking down the street
[1:56:32] think about how many people you come in
[1:56:34] contact with in a
[1:56:37] week and a
[1:56:40] day sometimes tens sometimes 50s
[1:56:44] sometimes hundreds maybe even thousands
[1:56:46] in a in a week's time that you come in
[1:56:49] contact with and it's you to be a
[1:56:52] minister of the light of the Gospel of
[1:56:54] Jesus Christ to a lost and dying
[1:56:59] world that's you you're the
[1:57:02] minister it's not up just to me and
[1:57:04] brother Bor and brother Donnie and
[1:57:06] brother Ron and brother Andrew brother
[1:57:08] Joe all these different
[1:57:11] ones you are the
[1:57:20] minister we want to get to a
[1:57:24] place that we're being a
[1:57:27] light shake the
[1:57:30] salt turn on the
[1:57:35] light John 7 there's records of a woman
[1:57:38] that's caught in
[1:57:40] adultery Jesus is passing by the temple
[1:57:43] and and and teaching and the people in
[1:57:45] the temple courts and here comes the
[1:57:47] teachers and the Pharisees that bring
[1:57:48] this woman up and they tell Jesus said
[1:57:51] we've caught this woman in the very Act
[1:57:52] of
[1:57:55] adultery they make a mockery of her and
[1:57:58] stand her up before the whole
[1:58:01] crowd it says teacher this woman was
[1:58:04] caught in the very Act of adultery and
[1:58:06] the law of Moses commanded us to Stone
[1:58:09] such a woman what do you
[1:58:13] say the Trap is
[1:58:16] set yeah that's all this was was a
[1:58:19] trap let's see if we can get him to
[1:58:21] confess the the wrong way he'll have
[1:58:23] he'll have the government against him
[1:58:25] either that or he'll have the church
[1:58:26] against him either that or he'll he'll
[1:58:28] belittle the law of
[1:58:30] Moses the Trap is set what do you
[1:58:34] say in this case of
[1:58:37] adultery you see in the case of adultery
[1:58:39] it's stoning if Jesus recommends stoning
[1:58:42] and the one or recommended the woman be
[1:58:44] released he's breaking the law of
[1:58:48] Moses making it nonchalant the law of
[1:58:52] doesn't matter and and if he recommends
[1:58:55] stoning the woman he's breaking the
[1:58:56] Roman law bringing the Wrath of the
[1:58:58] government down on him but did the
[1:59:01] Jewish leaders really care about the law
[1:59:04] or what would or what wouldn't happen no
[1:59:07] they didn't
[1:59:08] care they just wanted to know what what
[1:59:11] would happen to this adulterous woman in
[1:59:13] the eyes of
[1:59:17] Jesus so instead of stepping into this
[1:59:20] legalistic snare that they had set
[1:59:22] before
[1:59:23] him Jesus silently Stoops
[1:59:27] down and he begins to
[1:59:31] trace in the
[1:59:34] sand and Jesus begins to scribes things
[1:59:38] in the
[1:59:39] sand and when he finally stands up he
[1:59:43] says let any one of you without sin cast
[1:59:46] the first stone
[1:59:53] and one by
[1:59:55] one the devalues let's call them that
[1:59:58] the
[1:59:59] devalues start dropping their
[2:00:04] Stones bending down again Jesus begins
[2:00:07] to
[2:00:10] write and this poor young lady stands
[2:00:13] there no doubt with tears of
[2:00:16] Shame tears of defeat tears of of a life
[2:00:21] that she probably wish she didn't have
[2:00:22] to
[2:00:24] live you know nobody wants to live that
[2:00:27] life sometimes it's out of necessity
[2:00:30] it's to feed themselves it's to put a
[2:00:33] roof over their head to have shelter and
[2:00:34] I'm not justifying not making it right
[2:00:36] but I'm telling you the truth nobody
[2:00:38] wants to live that kind of
[2:00:41] life and here she stands through tears
[2:00:44] of of of Anguish and Jesus is
[2:00:48] describing I am forgiveness
[2:00:53] I am
[2:00:55] peace I am
[2:00:58] hope you are
[2:01:01] loved fear is a
[2:01:03] liar behold I make all things
[2:01:09] new you see while the Pharisees was
[2:01:12] writing her off Jesus was writing her
[2:01:19] in how each one of us could have had our
[2:01:22] lives written off by the lives we were
[2:01:26] living by the lives that we lived the
[2:01:29] the the horrible things we've done in
[2:01:30] our past but Jesus didn't write us out
[2:01:34] he didn't put a big X on our life he
[2:01:36] said the Lamb's Book of Life your name
[2:01:39] is written and it cannot be
[2:01:47] erased Jesus cared about her most
[2:01:50] pressing need about the pain in her life
[2:01:53] and he looked at her and he says
[2:01:56] woman where are those
[2:02:02] accusers
[2:02:04] woman and when we hear that we think man
[2:02:06] he was fussing at her he was fussing at
[2:02:09] her he's demeaning to her he's
[2:02:12] belittling her
[2:02:14] woman but when he said that when he said
[2:02:17] woman he wasn't devaluing her he was
[2:02:20] adding value to her
[2:02:23] name when he said woman it's the very
[2:02:26] same word that he used towards his
[2:02:30] mother when Jesus and the and the
[2:02:33] disciples and and his mother Mary were
[2:02:35] at the wedding they run out of wine
[2:02:37] didn't they and she come to him and she
[2:02:40] said
[2:02:41] Jesus I know you've never done anything
[2:02:43] before anybody but I know how special
[2:02:46] you
[2:02:47] are I know what you're capable of Jesus
[2:02:52] I know that you can turn a bad
[2:02:55] situation of mockery and
[2:02:57] shame yeah because if they run out of
[2:02:59] wine they G to be
[2:03:02] ridiculed I know you can fix this
[2:03:04] situation
[2:03:06] Jesus and Jesus looked at her and he
[2:03:09] said what
[2:03:14] woman woman and when we look at this we
[2:03:17] would immediately think man he's rude to
[2:03:20] his mother he he's impolite how many of
[2:03:23] you would knock your kids teeth out if
[2:03:25] they looked at your wife and said woman
[2:03:27] what do you think you're
[2:03:30] doing sister Becky said ain't nobody
[2:03:32] going to do it for me I'll do it
[2:03:39] myself so we naturally think that that
[2:03:42] is derogatory that's impolite and it's
[2:03:44] rude but that's not the case it was an
[2:03:47] idiom you know what an idiom is an idiom
[2:03:49] is when you take a word and you say it
[2:03:51] but it may the opposite like if I said
[2:03:53] look
[2:03:54] out heads
[2:03:56] up what does that mean
[2:04:01] duck in this very word when we look at
[2:04:03] the native part of it we look at the
[2:04:05] word in the scripture Jesus is is saying
[2:04:08] woman it's not rude but what he is
[2:04:10] actually saying when he addresses the
[2:04:12] woman called in adultery and he says
[2:04:14] woman what he is saying is
[2:04:18] ma'am
[2:04:20] ma'am you don't have have no
[2:04:23] accusers ma'am you don't have nothing to
[2:04:25] hang your head
[2:04:26] about ma'am I have forgiven you for all
[2:04:29] that you've done
[2:04:32] wrong
[2:04:33] ma'am you're one of
[2:04:37] mine go and sin no
[2:04:42] more one by
[2:04:44] one all the
[2:04:47] accusers had left their
[2:04:49] Stones you see brothers and sister
[2:04:52] sisters how I perceive
[2:04:55] others will determine how I behave
[2:04:58] towards others and how I behave towards
[2:05:02] others will determine how they see
[2:05:05] me let that sink in take notes if you're
[2:05:08] taking notes write that one
[2:05:10] down I was at this conference and this
[2:05:13] gentleman that I come in contact with
[2:05:15] and become friends with and we were
[2:05:17] standing there and course it's thousands
[2:05:19] of people and we're standing there and
[2:05:21] we're we're just kind of he said you
[2:05:22] know Brad he said have you ever looked
[2:05:25] at somebody and you had a preconceived
[2:05:27] notion about how they
[2:05:29] were before you talk to them and then
[2:05:31] when you talk to them you find out
[2:05:33] they're nothing like you thought they
[2:05:34] would
[2:05:36] be I said yeah that's good I'm gonna
[2:05:39] write that one
[2:05:41] down because that's what we do and
[2:05:43] that's what happens we can look at
[2:05:45] somebody we look at the way they're
[2:05:46] dressed we look at the way their their
[2:05:48] their their hair is their makeup is
[2:05:49] their their garments are
[2:05:52] and we think man I know what kind of
[2:05:54] Critter this
[2:05:57] is and then you might talk to them and
[2:05:59] they may just be as
[2:06:01] kind and
[2:06:04] friendly but they just never met
[2:06:09] Jesus and we're worried about getting
[2:06:12] them in the message I just want them to
[2:06:14] get to
[2:06:15] Jesus the rest will take care of
[2:06:18] itself there's a story
[2:06:21] maybe some of you heard
[2:06:23] it I heard it for the first time and it
[2:06:25] stood out to me I thought it's good I'm
[2:06:27] going to use this you know John Maxwell
[2:06:29] said it ain't
[2:06:31] plagiarism he said you use whatever I
[2:06:33] got it ain't plagiarism use whatever I
[2:06:35] got he said because as you're using it
[2:06:37] I'm writing more
[2:06:38] content he said I don't need it anymore
[2:06:40] anyway I've done used it he said what
[2:06:42] you do is you go up there and you say
[2:06:43] John Maxwell said this this this he
[2:06:46] said' then the next time you go up there
[2:06:48] you say a man once said this this and
[2:06:50] this' he said the third time you use it
[2:06:53] you say well you know I was
[2:06:57] thinking some of you got
[2:07:02] it but a man fell into a pit and
[2:07:05] couldn't get himself out how many's ever
[2:07:08] heard this you've heard this story Tommy
[2:07:11] everybody's heard it raise your hand if
[2:07:13] you ever if everybody's heard it I'm
[2:07:15] done a man fell into a pit and couldn't
[2:07:18] get himself
[2:07:19] out and a subjective person person came
[2:07:22] along and he looked down in the pit and
[2:07:23] he said I feel for you down
[2:07:26] there and an objective man came along
[2:07:29] and he said it's logical that someone
[2:07:32] would fall down
[2:07:34] there he said a Christian Scientist come
[2:07:37] by and said you only think that you're
[2:07:39] in a
[2:07:41] pit and a Pharisee said only bad people
[2:07:44] fall in
[2:07:47] pits a mathematician calculated all the
[2:07:50] dimensions of the pits
[2:07:53] a news reporter wanted an exclusive
[2:07:54] story about how the man fell into the
[2:07:57] pit a realist said yes that is a
[2:08:02] pit geologist said you know you should
[2:08:05] study the rock strata while you're in
[2:08:06] the
[2:08:08] pit an evolutionist said you are a
[2:08:10] registered mutant designed to be removed
[2:08:12] from the evolutionary cycle in other
[2:08:13] words you're going to die in that pit so
[2:08:15] that you cannot produce any more pitf
[2:08:17] falling offspring
[2:08:22] that was a
[2:08:24] mouthful the County Inspector asked the
[2:08:27] man do you have a permit to dig in that
[2:08:30] pit and a professor gave him a lecture
[2:08:32] on the elementary principles of the
[2:08:35] pit an evasive person came along and
[2:08:37] avoided the subject of the pit
[2:08:40] altogether the self-pitying person said
[2:08:43] you haven't seen anything till you've
[2:08:44] seen the pit I fell
[2:08:47] into the charismatic said just confess
[2:08:50] that you're not in a
[2:08:54] it some of you got
[2:08:57] that The Optimist said things could be
[2:08:59] worse and the pessimus said things will
[2:09:02] get
[2:09:03] worse but Jesus seeing the man in the
[2:09:06] pit said take my hand I'll lift you out
[2:09:09] of that
[2:09:11] pit
[2:09:14] yeah take my hand I'll lift you out of
[2:09:17] that pit we need some people that are
[2:09:19] willing to grab a hold of the ERS and
[2:09:22] say grab a hold let me show you Jesus
[2:09:24] I'll lift you out of that pit I'll take
[2:09:26] you to the God I know I'll show you the
[2:09:28] kind of life that I live and you'll see
[2:09:30] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:09:32] today and forever he saves the
[2:09:36] Lost he heals the
[2:09:39] Brokenhearted he rebuilds the destroyed
[2:09:45] lives you say I I need some more message

[2:14:40] if you can't come here at the Tabernacle
[2:14:42] get some church

[2:14:55] grocery store that needs to be
[2:14:59] saved I'm working on this in my life
[2:15:03] because I have sat and looked at people
[2:15:04] and and I felt like somebody nudged me
[2:15:06] in a direction and say hey do you know
[2:15:09] Jesus but did I ever say
[2:15:11] it
[2:15:14] no
[2:15:16] why it's the greatest thing I've ever
[2:15:19] known so why is it so hard to reach out
[2:15:23] why is it so hard if I could come to the
[2:15:26] realization that it is so
[2:15:30] important to take the word that God has
[2:15:33] given us the gifts that God has given
[2:15:35] us the message of Salvation and just ask
[2:15:38] do you know Jesus what's the worst they
[2:15:41] can say no get out of my face you crazy
