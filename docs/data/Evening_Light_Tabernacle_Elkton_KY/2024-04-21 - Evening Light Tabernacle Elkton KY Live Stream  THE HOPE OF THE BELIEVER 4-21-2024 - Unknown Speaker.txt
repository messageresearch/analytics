========================================

e [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music] for [Music] good morning everyone uh it's good to be in the house of the Lords stand with me if you will we'll just ask uh brother Caleb if you would open the Service in order to prayer amen uh children can be dismissed to Sunday school and uh turn with me if you if you will to Psalms 28 unto thee will I Cry Oh Lord my rock be not silent to me lest if thou th be silent to me I become like them that go down into the pit draw not draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbors but Mischief is in their hearts because they regard not the works of the Lord nor the operation of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will I praise him in this one together save thy people and bless thine inheritance feed them also and lift them forever Amen brother Brian you may be seated I promise not to fall morning Brothers ands I promise I'll try not to scream I'm not used to holding a mic if you would turn with me to uh Titus the first chapter I was uh you know I do that devotional the one you know that from spoken word every morning and U I was reading in in job this morning the second chapter this is what I'm saying the story I was the sometimes we miss the fact that when when job was in sackcloth and Ashes his friends before they even answered him or said anything to job they sat there for seven days in sa cloth and Ashes with job and I I was just thinking you know sometimes you really need to think about what you're going to say to somebody or what kind of idea you're going to hold to you really need to sit in prayer and be silent sometimes so God can really speak to you now later on in the book his friends were accusing him of secret sin but I was thinking they were willing to Humble themselves with their friend for seven days and DUS and Ashes and sackcloth just to be with their friend and to comfort him and I was just thinking how true is it for us this morning that sometimes someone just needs you to be a friend just needs you to be a comfort doesn't mean you have to say anything you just have to be there for them when they need you to be there for them and I I'm going to read from this first chapter I was listening a few messages this morning yeah I'm getting loud again but U I feel sorry for the people in the back but I I'll just read this chapter here and I was uh listening to that message uh from a different year but it it's the same convinced and concerned message that brother Bram preached so many years ago uh if you were born on that date you would be about 63 years old this morning but I'll just read it's not a lot of scriptures in this book this morning Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledgement of the truth which is after godliness you know there's a you can go quick but you could spend hours and days just taking senten and going back to your Bible finding other areas in the Bible that deal with that same subject in the hope of eternal life which God cannot lie promised before the world began but hath in due time manifest his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the Commandments of God our savior you know that's really striking right there that one verse right there you know God shows through the foolish of and I'm not saying preaching but in the scriptures foolishness of preaching to speak to the world the world thinks it's crazy they think it's stupid they think it's arrogant but in the fact that's the very thing that's going to save your soul in your life and goes on to say to Titus my own son after the common Faith grace and mercy and peace from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior for this cause I left thee in cre that thou should have set in order the things that are wanting and ordain El Elders in every city that I had appointed thee as I'm I was reading this this morning and a few other places you know like brother Brandon was preaching in that message concern convinced un concerned you have to be convinced first uh before you like you said before you can be concerned you have to be convinced for the age that you live in that the word of God is right you have to be convinced that God has started a work in you and finished it this morning or you can't be concerned about anything because you don't have the foundation to start with and I hope I don't lose my PR Place Titus my own son after the common Faith grace and mercy and peace from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior for this cause I left thee in cre that thou should have said in order the things that are wanting to attain Elders in every city as I had appointed thee so Timothy and Titus and all them were doing exactly what Paul told them to do and it's no different for us we should be doing exactly what the message of the hour and the word of God tells us to do in our day and age and he goes on to say if any be blameless and the husband of one wife having faithful children nor accused of Riot or unruly I'm really thinking further down in the chapter for a bishop must be blameless as a steward of God not self-willed that goes against everything out there in the age that we live in not self-willed not soon angry not given to Wine no Striker not given to filthy lucer and you could when you think of the church World we're in right now you can look at those last two words there but a lover of hospitality a lover of Good Men sober just holy and temperate holding fast the faithful words as he ha been taught that he may be able by sound Doctrine both to exort and to convince the gain Slayer and I was thinking of that word to convince the only way you can convince the people that you intermingle with every day of your life you to convince them you have to be convinced yourself that what you believe is the truth and if you're not totally convinced what you believe this morning is the truth then when you get intermingling with other people you're not going to have the concern and you're not going to have the foundation you need to give them the truth that they need in that time and now I didn't I'm almost lost my place there for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers especially they of circumcision whose mouths Must Be Stopped to subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not and filthy lucer saved and I was when you look at that scripture this morning you know we're just talking Paul's day where they were just gossiping as they ran across each other through their cities or the country they had to see each other they physically had to go you know to do this but in our day and age you don't have to do that anymore you're you're all sitting there this morning with your smartphones able to do this you're able to destroy a man's life or a woman's life this morning with the very so phone you have sitting next to you and he goes on to say here I lost my place I keep saying that but holding fast the faithful words has been taught may be able by sound a both to exalt and to convince the gains Slayer for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers especially they of circumcision whose mouths must be stop who subvert Soul houses I know I lost my place teaching things what they ought not to Filthy LC or Sake One of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretans are always Liars evil beasts and slow bellies this witness is true wherefore rebuke them Sly that they may be sound in the faith not giving heed to Jewish fables and I'm looking at Jewish fables this morning you know the world is full of fables in our day and age the Commandments of man are turn from the truth unto the pure all things that are pure unto them that are the father and unbelieving and nothing pure but even their minds and conscience is defiled they possess that they know God but in their Works they deny him being abominable and disobedient unto every good work you know and you can take these scriptures this morning as you interact with the people in the world you everything we do has to be through the filter of God's word no matter what someone's telling you everything has to be taken through the filter of God's Ro you have to take what people tell you what you see them doing you have to take it through the filter of God's word and through and the most important thing that you can't leave out in that is you have to in everything that you do you have to use God's Divine love and how you deal with whatever those situations bring about in your life and as I was uh I don't want to move this mic because I'll be all over the place but I was thinking what brother brandham had to say I I was reading also the whole Gospel of John uh yesterday and I was thinking of the eighth and the ninth chapter I'm if I get to reading it I'll be here forever but in the eth chapter of John is where Jesus is dealing in the temple with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and they couldn't accept who Jesus Christ was they couldn't accept the fact that he was the son of God and that God was speaking to them through him they weren't convinced of who Jesus Christ was and he was constantly struggling going with them in the eth chapter and I'm just going to I know I said something I'm going to do the total opposite this morning but in this eighth chapter of John I'll just read what he had to say here these few scriptures here and they and everyone knows that they they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus said unto them if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham and it's no different for us this morning you all know who Jesus Christ was this morning you have his very word if that's in you you're going to do those very works just like he's telling them if they really knew Abraham they would do what Abraham did but you now seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham you do the Deeds of your fathers they said then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God Jesus said unto them if you if God were your father you would love me and for I proceede forth and came from God neither came I of myself and he that sent me while you you not understand my speech even the words you cannot hear my words you be of your father the devil and the lust of your fathers you will do he was a murderer from the beginning Abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he spoke he spoke he speaketh when he speaketh a lie and he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of all because I tell you the truth you believe me not and then he goes to say the same thing to them which of you can convince convince me of sin I say the truth why do you not believe me and he he said use that same word here they couldn't they weren't convinced that Jesus Christ who he said it was and I'll just read read this here but I was I just wrote down some bullets from that message that I was listening into what brother brandham had to say you know these are just some ideas not ideas things he said that if you're convinced you'll believe these things number one if you're convinced you'll believe the Bible is the word of God and it's the truth that you won't be wavering back and forth you'll actually believe that the Bible and the scriptures are the word of God and this and you'll you're convinced and you believe that the holy spirit is for you this day and that you can be baptized and full of of it this morning and you'll believe that God heals you'll be convinced you you won't doubt it anymore he went on to say you believe that this message what we believe is a message to the last Church of Gentile Church age you believe that you won't you won't waver in that belief and you'll hear what the word for the hour and the most important thing he kept saying time and time again and you'll believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever no matter what your friends tell you no matter what the people out in the world say about it you'll honestly and truthfully believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and everything you do in life everything that you believe will be based on that simple principle this morning and I'll just read I I don't want to I'll just read I know I'm one of those kind of fellas that says a lot in a few minutes but I'll uh just read this last part of this quote this morning and uh if I can find a good place to jump into it it says yeah I'll start right about here all of them want to look like one another and he's basically saying everyone wants to be like his neighbor everyone wants to be you know a son wants to be like his father there's nothing wrong about it a mother uh a daughter wants to be like his mother if those are good things everyone wants to copy everyone but but we only want to copy the True Image and that image is Jesus Christ but I'll I'll just read all of them want to look like one another it's matching time you know that's true it's a matching time amen I'm not going to tell you my brother I don't care whether my shoes my match my trousers or my trousers match my coat I want my experience to match God's Bible and that's the matching time and that's what I'm trying to say this morning that we have to match the art experience has to match the word of God for the hour that we live in and he goes on to say here if you want to match something match your experience against fals you know a lot of people talk about the message how we're following a man you know brother Bram always P pointed back to Paul he he wasn't afraid to tell that we needed to do like Paul did he even says that right here and he goes on match your experience against Paul and that and Paul's experience is brother Brown's experience it's not hard to believe amen that's what we need today it's a matching time with Paul's faith in the Bible that's our example right the real matching time don't try to match your neighbor match some of the Saints of the Bible so he's giving you an example here you should mimic the examples in God's word that's what you should be mimicking not the crazy stuff that's out there in the world and he goes on to say I don't want to re don't try to match your neighbor match some of the Saints of the Bible if you're a saint a like a saint walk like a saint dress like a saint talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a saint dress like a saint be a saint you know but basically what is saying you can't manufacture these things they have to come from the inside out if you're trying to manufacture these things there'll come a day when you're that experience will run up against something if you're manufacturing it won't hold that day so it's got to come from the inside out just like a plant grows from the inside out it's the same way here but the the seed and the plant have to be the same in the end and you go saying walk like a saint dress like a saint talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a saint dress like a saint be like a saint live like a saint die like a saint and as we get older that that means that's more important to me this morning than it was 20 years ago and go to heaven like a saint amen and if I said would say anything the most important thing as this year goes on I you know being sat down for the last three or four months of this last surgery I would say that as I see the world how crazy as it is if you're a real saint of God or a real Christian it should get you closer to the Bible and to the word of God it should drive you even closer shouldn't drive you further away it should drive you into the hands of Jesus Christ into the love of God not far from it and like I said anytime you come up against a struggle or something that's hard in your life if you truly got God's experience I'm not saying it's going to be easy but you got all the tools you need to be successful in whatever that situation is this morning brother David I need turn this off amen you love the Lord this morning amen let's stand if we could this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen amen enjoyed Sunday school this morning and it's good to have each and everyone out this morning it's good

that I just I just didn't have it together and I'm getting older and I forget and I get in a hurry and I'm horrible when I get in a hurry and me and the hood collided and the hood got the better half and and I have a real expensive tool and I left it on my trailer and I was driving down the road it's about a $900 tool and it fell off and I didn't realize it till that afternoon till I needed it and it was gone and the first word out of my mouth was dummy David you have got to slow down and my wife has told me she said you got to slow down honey you're G to kill yourself and just been so busy and had so many things going on and I thought well Lord I hate to the thinking in my mind now is I hate to waste the money you've given me but I I can I guess I'll buy another one because I need it and and I stopped in at a place and a friend of mine he said hey buddy did you lose this [Applause] and there was that tool but you know the socket had fell off of it and I thought well that's no big deal we can handle that the next time I was at a place and where it was at I lost it I stepped out and guess what I stepped on the socket and I said Lord forgive me for being slowful and not being thankful I said because lord I can't even walk I can't even do anything anymore without you helping me and you know you know they always say we we need the honest confession and I always thought I could do anything but you know what I found out now I need him more every day every step of the way and this guy here and we went and ate at Cracker Barrel the other night me and Janet and we had a young waitress she's 19 years old and I don't know how we got on talking about God but we did and she began to tell me that she was a Christian and she began to tell us that she was realizing that she couldn't stay with her friends in the world she was having to give her life to God she was having to pray more and she was having to she said when I read my Bible she said it just don't work you can't do both and you know we begin to talk to her and just tell her about the things of the Lord and talk to her she said next time y'all come in here she said ask for me so I can serve you and we've ate in Cracker Barrel in Clarksville many times but we've never had the awesome service that we had from her and I thought you know you don't see many young people outside of the message in the world that are really dedicated that really have a love in their heart and life and I don't know what kind of church she goes to but you know what she was a light to me because I thought she didn't mind speaking about what God had done in her heart so we told her about mom and her wreck and she said well let me show you my picture of my wreck and she said God is a miral working God he's an awesome God this morning and aren't you glad you serve a god like that this morning and you know I said you know everybody's worried about this or that I said you know what I'm a winner if I if I stay and I'm a winner if I die because I'm Going Home With Jesus tomorrow and that's what we're thankful we're the glad to be a winner winner this morning and brother Daniel and brother Caleb and brother Carson uh brother

enjoyed the services lately amen praise the Lord amen I bought ruined the last one didn't I amen but anyway apologize kind of getting a little bit too happy amen I was a little tired tired to begin with so whenever I got to thinking the wrong thought amen not the wrong thought but it just funny thought it hit me like that's about the first time I couldn't quit laughing amen I was like I'm mess the service up for sure amen anybody else I'm that i' have probably got the deacons on them but anyway they all forgive me amen just God is good isn't he amen we're thankful for his goodness and here we get to just get together again enjoy the blessings of how many believes that we are a very very very very very very privileged people folks I'm here to tell you we are a very privileged people the whole world is privileged they just don't know it amen amen and so this morning amen I want to take a subject that I just don't hear I don't speak on it much don't hear much of it amen but I I just you know I feel led to speak on it I think I've spoke on it not so long ago amen and um it just come to me and I thought well you know this is kind of service you know that I don't know just who amen uh it's for I thought in my own mind just expressing my mind it might only be for 5% of us maybe 2% I don't know but I just know one thing and that is always follow the leading of the spirit ain't that right amen because that shows how much I know at the end of the service Everybody Must say well that was for me amen but anyway uh we want to speak on Hope amen want to speak about Hope amen and so we'll go to the Lord in prayer before we start Heavenly Father we come before you once again grateful Lord Jesus for this wonderful place that you've given and most of all for the Believers that you have given us the fellowship with Lord be able to Fellowship one with another Lord Jesus and Lord to open up your word father knowing god that it is our absolute Lord and father we just hang our soul on every word that you have spoken God and that you have given we just desire Lord Jesus as I feel God that you've laid this thought on My Heart Lord and I believe God that you've got it for somebody and I just pray Lord that it'll fall on good ground and bring forth a h hundredfold Lord we just want to thank you for this opportunity now and thank you so much for feeling better and for all those who you helped to get better Lord and we believe God you'll touch sister Janette that she'll be better also Father this morning we thank you for those Lord you've been given traveling mercies to and will give traveling Mercies today Father coming back home from Johnson City and different places Lord we just ask God that you'll just bless your service now and help me to get out of the way and use my lips and my heart Lord to speak the things that you once said Lord close my lips anything that I shouldn't say or that would be in my flesh Lord so father we surrender ourselves to you now I ask him God that you'd use us now in Jesus name amen and amen open your bibles if you will to book of First Corinthians amen First Corinthians 13 First Corinthians 13 and we want to read verse 13 now abideth faith hope and charity the three but the greatest of these is Charity may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen we want to take our time today is that okay since we just do to one service I think if we do a service in a half that'll be about right amen so praise the Lord let's not be in a hurry because amen we just want to take our time in this so we see here that Paul of course talking whenever he was talking about gifts of tongues and and and Faith to move mountains and all these other things that he spoke to us and let us know that of all these three main ingredients in our lives charity of course was the greatest isn't that right amen and he mentions faith and he puts hope in there puts hope in there amen and that's what we want to dwell on for a while this morning amen now how many knows there is a different between Faith and Hope amen Faith and Hope there's a little bit of a difference there amen we know that whenever uh uh whenever you're given faith faith is something that has muscles and it makes it so isin't that right it I forget just the exact quote but he said it that faith comes and it tramps down it brings into submission the enemy it makes it so and if you genuinely have faith you don't have a hope it's not a hope anymore it's it's something more than that amen amen if you have a real Revelation amen of God of course we know that's what fa fa real genuine faith is is something that God has revealed to you a't that right like uh uh Jesus said to Peter who do men say that I the son of man am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and he says you know flesh and blood is not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven ain't that right he our our Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I want to take you to a scripture that kind of pretty much brings it to the same level of uh of uh strength that hope is brought to the same amount of strength as what this scripture about this Rock Amen is and I'll take you to the scripture for that because it's kind of hard for us to Fathom amen that Faith or hope would be that power F ain't that right hope hope whether you know it or not is very powerful now in some situations some circumstances amen I believe even the prophet made the quote it mentioned about how that sometimes hope can be your biggest enemy amen because there's some things that you don't want to hope for but that you want to have faith for that you want to believe amen I want to say something else about hope I believe that uh hope Amen to me hope means possibility amen it brings possibility amen amen and so uh as I was saying faith it makes it so I believe brother Bram said you know if God revealed to me that God was going to raise Abraham Lincoln up is that what he used either Abraham or George Washington I believe it was Abraham Lincoln if God revealed he's going to ra he would invite the whole world to come and watch how many know when there is something revealed when it's thus sayith the Lord you never had to wonder about that anymore there's no no question whatsoever on that amen but we're we're going to dwell in the areas of times perhaps that amen you're not sure of something and and and another great s a great thought and a great subject that would be good to take would be trust amen how many know trust is another another level also it's when amen I believe there's a song he says when you can't see God's hand trust his heart amen amen some sometimes all you can do is trust amen I remember talking to brother Donnie and talking about his daughter and all the faith that people have had to try to you know believe for her healing and oh my almost prophecies given on her healing and so forth yet in it all God still takes her amen and so we were speaking tonight and I thought you know sometimes you just have to trust and and he said that's exactly right because that's where he was at he says you know when you don't understand why you don't understand why he's not doing it or whatever ever then you trust that he's got it in control you trust God amen amen and of course many many things in the Old Testament amen blessed is he that trusteth in the Lord is that right anybody that trusts in the Lord is a blessed person amen and so sometimes that what we have it's it's in the in the areas of sometimes we're not sure about we like sure we like preach on faith we like to preach on charity but I think it's also necessary that we preach on this hope amen praise the Lord amen it just comes to mind uh where it says there's one Lord One Faith one hope one baptism is't that right there's one hope amen but Brandon makes a statement he says you know he says there's not one thing left my Christian friend but the coming of the Lord Jesus that's the only hope that the church has amen that the church has that the believer has how many of know that's the only hope that you got is the coming of the Lord how many beli the Rapture is the only way out the only way out is the rapture it's the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only hope for the church amen so how many believes we need to grab a hold of that hope amen amen and really lay hands on it so to speak amen amen praise the Lord let me uh share with you amen and I want to read different scriptures to kind of lay a foundation but let's go to um Hebrews I want to turn to Hebrews and take you and show you uh the stability of this anchor that we have in the book of Hebrews I believe it is the six chapter amen and Hebrews 6 and verse 11 it says and we desire that everyone every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises amen how many believes that sometimes when you don't see what's going on when you don't understand then it takes patience amen amen now notice in verse 18 Amen in verse 18 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us which hope we have remember I said that he on the same level now as this Revelation here he says which hope we have have as an anchor of the Soul wow now we find that this anchor this fa this hope that we have it's an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil amen how many knows that song be very sure be very sure that your Anchor Holds and grips the Solid Rock Amen it grips that Solid Rock Romans 15 I've got a lot of scriptures here so and I y'all pray for me I want to get to where I can maybe get this somehow all just lined up and we won't have to have as much time going from one to the other amen 15 Romans 15 Romans 15 and13 says now the god of Hope amen the god of Hope remember we talked about how that God has attributes how him was to be father and him was to be savior now we find coming another another uh uh light another rainbow so to speak or something else that's flooding out is the god of Hope because how many knows that with whoever God is there's always hope amen the god of Hope fill you with joy and peace in believing that you may abound in Hope Paul talked a lot about hope through the power of the Holy Ghost verse four of chapter 15 says for whatsoever things were written before now notice how many know faith comes by hearing is't that right now it talks about for whatsoever things were written before time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope how many believe that hope is a very very powerful thing yes it is amen it's like the light at the end of a tunnel amen remember over there in uh 1 John 3 and verse three it says and every man but let me go back beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him talking about sporn again Sons and Daughters of God Amen for we shall see him as he is and every man that have this hope in him purify himself even as he is pure so this hope amen that we have of seeing him and being like him and having a body like it to his own body how many believes that's for us amen we're going to have a body like his own body amen and we have this hope in them in that then we purify ourselves from the inside out man that hath this hope purifieth himself even as he is pure praise the Lord all right let's look at another one another one of what hope is in Romans 8 Romans 8 verse4 24 I'll just mention this here before as you're turning there it says for we are saved by hope don't hear that much do you we're saved by hope amen when I think of hope I think of the Concentration Camp Amen in Germany is't that right and word gets into this concentration camp that the Allies have landed is that right right they're heading this way now I don't know about you but they would have probably had to had to calm down a little bit not get too excited because when they were watching all of their friends and their relatives going to the gas chamber and they know they were dying little by little amen when they just hear that it gave them hope and with that hope comes great enthusiasm how many knows that's what God is that's what you have that's what I have we have God Amen the great is the mystery of God Amen it's Christ in you the hope of glory how many knows it's Christ in you that is your hope of ever amen seeing heaven or having the Rapture or having the body change it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen amen there old stuff wants to try to hang on into my chest amen but praise the Lord There's Hope praise the Lord so now notice this is not really the what I want to go to but let's let's go back here amen and look at uh Verse 18 of of chapter 8 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not be worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestations of the sons of God for the creature was made sub to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope amen how many know the very one that allowed us to go into sin and Deery amen whenever he put a word in there he says you know that he was going to redeem Adam isin't that right that he's going to bring it back so he allowed us to get into that condition all of humanity but he also subjected the same in Hope amen amen I said knew it would be a little different this morning but I when I can't when it came to me when I thought about this I thought about no matter as long as Christ is on The Mercy Seat is that right as long as Christ is on The Mercy Seat There's Hope the whole world you and I are we we we have we have laid hold on this hope we've accepted this hope we have it in our hearts do you realize before you can have hope that has to be placed down in your heart is that right no matter what your condition is no matter what your situation is if you don't believe there's any hope it is a sad situation what was the word that I was looking for amen I forget just what it was but despair perhaps if you don't have hope it's nothing but despair amen uh the dictionary of it was the definition of uh uh no hope and so forth was was was really really bad like uh condemned judged no way amen and do you realize the whole world today well let me just let me read you a scripture here one more scripture here in Ephesians 2 and I believe it was 12 it says that at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel strangers from the Covenant of Promise having no hope no hope and without God in the world now how many knows if you haven't got God you don't have any hope how how many glad that you've got God at one time you guys we all were without hope we had no hope how many knows that's the condition that the people are out there they believe they come from monkeys they don't believe they have any hope what a world to live in what a terrible state to be in to have no hope but the very reason that you got saved is because a man when you heard the gospel it gave you hope that if you'll believe in him you'll not perish but have everlasting life he is our hope Amen Brother David I don't know if you know that song at the end but my hope is in the Lord I want to sing that at the End Amen from this day on till forever more My Hope aren't Christ this Solid Rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness when all around my soul gives way he then is All My Hope and stay how many believes that it don't matter what comes it don't matter what goes he is my hope so we were without God we were without hope and so is the world out there living in a world without hope no wonder they tattoo themselves no wonder they Pier themselves no wonder they turn from males to females and from females to males and are completely confused they're in a loss world without hope but you know what the truth of it is there is hope for it I me believe there is hope for him I'm here to declare that there is hope for him but if you don't believe there's hope for you it'll take God to come down and give you a glimpse of that hope say Hey you know maybe there is hope that's the beginning that's the beginning of a great thing when you can believe hey maybe there is hope cuz God allows us to get into all kinds of conditions and I want to give you some examples here later on with the help of the Lord of different people who had no hope but yet God let put something down in there to give them hope it takes the grace and mercy of God to let you know hey there is hope there's light in the darkness There's Hope for the Hopeless amen God is the god of the impossible made possible how many believe that amen when we were without hope God died for us amen and brought us and gave us hope when I think about where I was in the world not looking for God my I'm so glad that I don't believe that we came from monkeys and that we're just another animal being no amen all right let me lay a little more before we go on to some of this let's go to Psalms in Psalms 33 verse 16 says there is no King Sav by the multitude of an hosts a mighty man is not delivered by much strength a horse is a vain thing for safety and neither shall he deliver any out of his great strength behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him and upon them that hope in his Mercy how many believes that when you have hope and when you hope in God God blesses you for that amen how are you going to get out of your situation well I'm trusting in the Lord My Hope is in the Lord that God will deliver me don't know if he will or not I never finished Romans for ye are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope amen how many believe that whenever you're hoping for something and all of a sudden that materializes it's not hope anymore it's here now amen for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for it amen we were saved by hope hope brought us to salvation but now that we have salvation you don't have to hope anymore why because now you know that you're are God because of the spirit that he has given to you one place the scripture says if we only have hope in Christ Jesus in this life we're of all men most risk well are you saved well I hope so you better be a little bit more sure than that you better know that you that you know that you got the holy ghost that you're one of gods have you got the Holy Ghost I hope so oh my kind of a dangerous place to be ain't it better go a little further than that amen so now notice the eyes of the Lord are those that help in his Mercy to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine ourth for the Lord he is our help and our shield for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in His holy name let thy mercy oh Lord be upon us according as we hope in thee or we could say trust in thee can y'all see the the significance between trust and hope you're just trusting him you're believing God is going to do it amen Romans 4 4 and verse 17 it's written I have made thee a father of many nations before whom before him whom he believed even God talking about Abraham who Quicken us to dead and call us those things which be not as though they were now how many knows that's what hope does Hope calls the things that are not as though they were you believe that listen to the next verse Abraham who against hope believed in Hope W the S my the situation looks hopeless but I believe it anyway how many believes against hope you still believe in hope God can do it God is able oh my I thought about it listen to me this is my punchline whatever situation you are in amen you better you have to believe in hope you got to know that that God that great God is still on the mercy seat and as long as he's on The Mercy Seat brother bam as long as you you might not be where you you are and where you should be you might be backslid it don't matter where you are but if you still got a desire to be a Christian to be better There's Hope for you so no matter how deep you are how backset you are how lukewarm you are might only be for one% here I don't know but if you're not where you ought to be with God then listen to this There's Hope for you if the church ain't what you ought to be There's Hope is There's Hope brother B for Revival said one place in the CR oh we've been fussing and splitting over churches and this that or the other but there's hope woo a't that right on so when you put your faith in God you're not delivered by the multitude or uh mighty man not delivered by much strength and this out or the other but when you're is in the Lord watch out amen how many remembers there three Hebrew children is't that right he says we don't know whether God will Deliver Us amen and see it's like Paul said we don't see it if you don't see it you hope for it you're still hoping for it until you see it you still have believe you believe for it believe in hope hope believes a that right they didn't know whether God would or not now I'm here to tell you that he if they had a revelation that God was going to deliver them they could have said look you can throw us in the fire but we won't burn God will deliver us then had a revelation but they said we don't know whether he will but this one thing we know we're not going to Bow because we know that he can our hope is in the Lord and God loved and he delivered them out of the burning fire W how many believes that keep hope keep believing no matter what you are if you're lukewarm believe God will bring you out of that if your backslid God will bring you out of that there There's Hope for this world but when that Mercy Seat is gone there will not be any hope you realize how many believes you and I are living in the hour when we're going to have the closing of Hope amen people come to the book of hope they'll come to the star of hope they'll come to the star of wanting salvation and wanting the mercy of God there won't be one hope left he that's filthy is filthy still he that's holy is Holy still how many believe now is the time to get get holy now is the time to take advantage of that hope that opportunity hope is an opportunity hope is opportunity in other words it's there for you if you want it amen how many knows it's there for Cain it's came it's there for everybody there's hope there for everybody because the word said whosoever will let him come long as he's on that mercies it it's for whosoever will let him come amen so sometimes we speak to people this morning we speak to people who it doesn't look like it you've prayed about it it doesn't happen huh let me tell you something how many knows it when God reveals to you you're healed when God reveals it to you you don't have to hope anymore you know it's going to happen but if not then what do you do you hope in the Lord you trust in the Lord and God loves that how many knows God loves to see that he loved it in the three Hebrew children they didn't know but we're going to do it anyway Amen brother BR says if God kicks me off at the end of the road condemns me he says this is still the way I want to live this is still the best Life to Live why because he had the peace of God in his heart he had the love of God in his heart he had a smile on his face he had joy in his heart what better way to live how many knows that's what people live for where people want joy people want peace people want a clear conscience they go all about it the wrong way but it's there there's still hope for the world if they'll just accept it but there'll come a time according to the scriptures he says they'll call on me and I won't answer amen isin't that right they'll seek me early they'll want me but Hope's gone amen I love when hope shows up I'm not sure there's a song When Hope arrived if y'all know that song pull that one up hope and hope arrives I like hope Ares amen he's just hoping for it believing for it then all of a sudden it shows up brother bam talked about barnab barnab blind Barnabas isn't that right he was hoping amen and then that hope arrived and he heard that he was over in his few streets over he began to cry out amen he believed in that hope and it did something for him praise the Lord so hope is something that you don't see amen you don't know God doesn't reveal it to you amen but yet you know God can amen Abraham against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations oh no way Abraham you're 99 years old your wife is 7 75 there's no hope yes there is a that right here we are in Lea the devil thinks he's going to swamp it no he's not where is our confidence what is Our Hope what is it that anchors why is that hope such an anchor because the real Christian's anchor is in the immutability of God's word God said he's going to have a church without spot without Rinko that's the believer's hope this morning the believer's hope is that he has begun the work he will finish it Glory he will finish it that's our hope amen that our hope is that no matter how hard the trial shall tribulation shall dist shall persecution shall see us shall lukewarm us no nothing will be able to separate us from the love of God that's our hope that's our anchor The Anchor Holds though the ship is battered The Anchor Holds though the the seals are torn amen I've fallen on my knees amen praise the Lord how many believe that amen as I face the amen stormy seas my anchor holds amen let's go to Ezekiel we want to try to take a few real what this is about this morning is to take some real dark scenarios uh perhaps in the darkest hour then Jesus comes isn't that right let's take some dark hours and then see Hope come amen how many believe that's what God's all about amen all right let me see Ezekiel hold on let that amen somebody say praise the Lord thank you Jesus while we're finding that we'll just give him some Glory Lamentations Ezekiel 37 Ezekiel 37 verse one it says and the Hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley that was full of Bones how many knows brother Braham talking about how that you know the church has gotten to where it was such in Dark Ages down am mean in the Middle Ages 1400s and so forth it was so dark and so dead and so spiritually dead that there needed to be a resurrection of Jesus Christ coming up out of the Dark Ages ain't that right amen and to ra can these bones live now notice in verse 11 I won't read you all of that we're not going to go all down there but y'all remember the story of the dry bones how he prophesied and and and caused the bones to come to together caus the skin to come or flesh to come together come the the the skin to come upon the flesh brought it all together but if you'll notice he said unto me in verse 11 son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off from our parts in other words they said they thought that all hope was gone all hope let's admit it looking at that valley of dry bones it would have looked like no there's not a chance but how many knows wherever God is there's always a chance there's always hope where God is boy if you don't hear nothing else in your mind tomorrow remember that wherever God is there's always hope we know that brother mam said beyond the regions of the lost or whenever you go from this world and you go out into the other world he says there's no hope for salvation over there this is your chance this is your hope now not only did he say that but many times in his altar calls he said you know tomorrow you may not you may be over there tomorrow you have no chance no promise of alive tomorrow none of us do here that's why you have to take advantage of that hope you have to take advantage of the privilege of God God has given you today not put it off some other day don't say well I'll do it another time you might not have and then you'll never have any chance there won't be a chance when you take that last breath this is your chance this is your hope now is the time I don't care where we are we as Christians you see well I'm not what I want to be well don't wait till tomorrow see God I want to change today I want more of you this morning now is the day of salvation cuz tomorrow it could be you could be in a world of no hope not a chance anymore even Jesus went and preached to the souls that were in prison they had no hope no chance of Salvation And yet he went and preached to them how many knows that old Israel all of the the Old Testament it talked about a savior coming talking about a deliverer talking about amen a redeemer coming ain't that right amen when he came in the person of Jesus Christ amen and they crucified him and he went to the and went into the grave amen the sun refused to shine amen went down in the middle of the day amen it looked like everything was lost it was a dark hour all the disciples had scattered the church was completely scattered it was a dark hour they were discouraged but then what happened on Easter morning when that sun came up amen Hope Has Arrived hope Rose the baptism of the Holy Ghost was going to come salvation had come Redemption had come Joy had come and I'm here to tell you when you get hope in your life you get joy unspeakable and full of Glory that's what hope does in the darkest hour all was lost the Bible says if no one's worthy to take that book no one's worthy to take it but there was a line that prevailed Amen on Easter morning that son arose Jesus Christ the tomb rolled the stone rolled away and all of humanity amen especially those who have had their names on the book is't that right how many believes God's word is true if he wrote your name on the book you reckon he's going to lose you no that's where our consolation is our hope is in the fact not that youve begun to work well now you better quit that and you better yeah you better live right if not the Holy Ghost will get you but that's not what your salvation's based on and your salvation is based on all that the father has given me will come amen he says and my father you know they wear in his hands and no man can pluck them out of my father's hand how many believes that he had you are in God's hands do you ever remember when you was kids you'd play and you'd hold something in your hand and say try to get it out of my hand you know it's something about that hand right now you might be able to peel that thumb back right that but you know to try to get to these guys try to get to them fingers especially a strong man it's very hard to get that hand open can't get that ho open well you sure ain't gonna get his hand open nobody's going to pluck you out of his hand nothing can and I'm resting on that how many our hope is in Christ and it's a solid rock you can never take that hope away from me that no matter what comes no matter what goes I'm in his hands God can come and change whatever situation you're in if you'll just believe worst thing that a person can do is think there's no hope no hope but you know brother Joe somebody that believes something has hope in something they're just about Unstoppable there's just about nothing that a person can't do if they believe in it what do you think Benjamin Franklin or or uh Thomas Edison I believe it was a't that right he hoped to have somehow create something that will make that right there how many knows that was that was Thomas Edison's dream that was his vision that was his hope and he tried and he tried a thousand different ways and he asked him well what about those thousand different way he says well now I have a thousand ways didn't I know it don't work but thanks be to God that he didn't give up hope got it today ain't that right aren't you glad that Christ didn't give up no he went all the way to Calvary so that you could be free this morning so you could have joy this morning unspeakable and full of glory amen oh the God just loves to make it look real dark to see whether you'll still believe in Hope that you'll still believe in Hope amen let's look at a couple more stories of course I love I love the story of Daniel don't you he didn't know but he trusted he his Hope was in the Lord the strength of horses the strength of Kings they're not delivered by the strength Kings aren't they aren't delivered by their strength now God showed in Daniel isn't that right that his strength is greater than any Kings or any Commandments we don't know what the future holds do we but aren't you glad you have a confidence that you know him that holds the future and whatever comes he's got you whatever comes he's got you woo oh my I want to go to Romans yet but let's go this way first I thought about the lepers all remember the four lepers there were four lepers men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die if we say we will enter into the city well the famine is in the city and we shall die there if we sit here we shall die also my my if we go in there we die if we stay here we die Ain that right so they were looking for a little hope weren't they they were looking for some glimpse of light at the end of this this tunnel here amen that's a lot of times how we are we need a little light at the end of the tunnel that's what the hope is a't that right amen notice we now therefore come let us fall on to the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and and if they kill us we shall but die amen think about it they were at that point of death and they only had one direction to go now we know the enemy man they have got it nice man they're eating good there's no famine over there a't that right and we're going to just have to go and throw ourselves at their Mercy is't that right and they rose up in the Twilight to go into the camp of the Assyrians and when they were coming to the other most parts of the camp of Syria behold there was no man there for the Lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of Chariots and the noise of horses even in the noise of a great hosts and they said one to another Lord the king of Israel has hired against us the Hittites and the king of the Egyptians to on us wherefore they arose and fled into Twilight left their tents and their horses their asses to Camp as it was and fled for their lives when the lepers came to the utmost parts of the camp they went into one tent they did eat and they drank and they car S silver I don't know about you but if you'll just trust in the Lord of Jesus Christ you may have depression you may have anxiety you may have all kinds of devils and demons and depression and guilty con but just come to him you'll eat good chill my cup Lord amen and you'll eat good how many believe son got to eat and drink and carry thin silver amen they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen ain't that right Believers you can have gold you can have deity rment white rment isn't that right they went and hid it and came again and entered into another kid and carried F also and went and hit it brother bad they were having a time look at all gold look at all this silver and this tent let's go and we're going to go and we're going to go and bury this these going to be ours amen oh my aren't you glad all of all of the treasures every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every L why don't you grab some of them and put it hide it in the earth hide it down in here hide these Treasures in the earth amen you're not guilty you never did it in the first place you're justifi as though you never I mean that's some real gold amen looks like it ain't never going to happen looks like it can't happen well I I doubt my doubts is that right I believe in hope against hope when there don't look like there is any hope I still know there is hope amen my that's right carried also and went and hid it then they said hey we can't be doing this all day let's go tell them isn't it something how that God drove them out in front of these lepers just before the lepers and the lepers are the ones that came back ain't that right and told them about hey they ain't there no more come on I mean that b of the way that a Believer is hey the devil ain't got no rights anymore come on and take the landine he's stripped of his power you don't have to live depressed you don't have to live with sin you don't have to live with unbelief you can have joy unspeakable amen appreciate the things of God how many how many once a take advantage of being privileged that's right get a whole message to eat and so forth you realize how There's 7 million illegal immigrants that's coming to our country they'll go through the water and a lot of them will drown and they'll go and climb fences and they'll do anything and they'll get in Trunks and they'll get in oh my all kinds of ways that they want to get in here why because of Hope their countries don't look don't have much hope bunch of dictators and killers and no no hope but they know that still they come here they're still hope we can get a job we can get make money do you realize I I thought about it the other day brother Brad you know having a family having a home being a Christian having church group and so forth and and you know this the American dream do you realize most of us have the American dream we've got the dream and we just take it for granted we're privilege that's what all of those folks want to have and we have it we don't even hardly appreciate it Lord help us amen make that spiritual also where privileged people every promise is yours take advantage of it amen we look at that right at the point of death just the glimpse of hope we're going to die we go this way we're going to die we go that way we're going to die we stay here so let's get up and go do something isin't that right how many believes that ought to be anybody's attitude well I feel so backslid I don't I'm not where I ought to be well get up and get back to Christ there is still another direction that you can go there's still hope for you amen aren't you glad that there is I'm so glad there is you might fail you might fall short let me tell you get on your knees there's still hope you might be the weakest Christians but there's still hope get on your knees there's still hope amen praise the Lord all right let me go let's talk about Samson for a minute brother Braham said a lot about this because I had called hope possibility is that right hope is a possibility in other words there's a chance yet there's hope and Sam you know he had been a Christian he was a mighty warrior of God looked at as a God that could not be defeated a't that right but he had got backslid he had got cold on God hope nobody's there like that today amen but he had got cold on God he had gotten away from what he used to be as a Christian good question right there folks got away from what he used to be as a Christian are you a better Christian today or was you a better Christian 5 years ago two years ago a month ago where are you at this morning amen say Samson had got way backslid his eyes had got taken out a't that right but brother baham said that he opened up his mind he said Samson thought that there must be a possibility see he caught the idea W isn't that right anybody anywhere whatever your situation is outside of blaspheming the Holy Ghost catch the idea catch that glimpse of Hope no know that you don't have to be like that that's the start right there and then go from there amen but the sad part listen he had caught the idea but the sad part is today the church don't catch that they don't realize that there is a possibility of a Revival they haven't caught the vision yet another place he says he knew that there was a possibility but the thing of it is today the people don't seem to be conscious that there is a possibility they're satisfied to go right on into the trend that they're always going on well I've always been like this you don't have to always be like this I've never overcome this that or the other well you can't overcome this that or the other there's a possibility that you can live higher than what you do There's Hope for you you've got a perfect mediator sitting there waiting for you to call upon him when he leaves that Throne people will beg and scream and everything else but there won't be any hope my definition of hell is no hope that's hell you want to live in a Hell live in a place where there's no hope that's why so many shoot themselves kill themselves they despair because there's nothing to live for young people you're going to think you're going to think well what am I going to do how I'm going to what am going to achieve where am I going to he put Christ in your life amen and there's no telling where you might go amen that's right there's always that praise the Lord he knew the possibility but Abraham said you know but he like Samson got down there and he beg begin to seriously die to himself he was willing to die to himself isin't that right let me die with these uncircumcised Philistines and so forth amen went back there and hey you know what I can reach that that's as long as it was before brother Bram brother Bram says he got in his mind he thought well you know there's a possibility that God could forgive me there's a possibility he could forgive me and he repented and said God forgive me and so forth with seriousness and so forth and maybe once more just once more is that right there's a possibility that I could get my power just once more how many believes there's a possibility to dischar can be on fire once again you as an individual you can be in a place you want to be and you need to be once again there is that possibility that's what hope gives you it's an anchor amen it's very very powerful amen Mark 4 if you remember Jesus Jesus went with them in a boat to cross over the lake isn't that right and he sent the multitude away verse 37 and There Rose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the so that it was now full amen and he was in the hinder part of the ship sleeping on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him Master carest thou not that we perish oh my how many those long as long as he's on the ship you ain't got nothing to worry about folks I don't care if you're about to drown amen just like the three Hebrew just like Daniel just like these Leb they were about to down they're about to go down but as long as there is a God around there is Deliverance for you amen I believe in another place remember when it was going across and they were didn't Jesus have Jesus on the ship they went on without him he went up on the mountain and it was tum almost and they threw everything off they could and they thought they was going to die but then came Jesus there their Hope Came oh aren't you glad when you're sick your hope comes it doesn't matter how dark it is let Hope come on the sea and it'll change the whole situation but sometimes Christ is in the harder part that's right we put God last in our life trouble come this happened and that happen all of a sudden your this that and the other isn't so important but your walk with God is something important and you got to go and knock at his door and say God I know I haven't been what I ought to be oh if I could say anything this morning if it's folks if you're not what you want to be in Christ you can be you can be there's a possibility there's hope for you There's Hope for the world Amen praise the Lord 400 years Israel was in slavery bondage ain't that right let me tell you something that is a dark world to live in 400 years in slavery task Masters beating them and all but how many knows there's a word said I'm going to send to deliver after so many years amen they still had a light that's the only light that you and I have is the word of the god that said he's going to do it he has begun a work and he will finish it amen praise the Lord hallelujah remember he is the god of Hope the god of Hope amen that if you'll put your trust your confidence and your hope in him no matter where you are whatever your situation is how many wants to remember that tomorrow when something happens that you're not expecting something comes along the way I'm glad that he's on the ship amen he'll be there is our hope for a resurrection how many knows he's our hope for a Rapture that's right that's the only hope that we have is the coming of the Lord amen we are confident our hope is completely anchored and stayed in Christ and it's actually according to the scripture it's the anchor of your soul is the hope that you have amen it's so great I know brother John and sister Alicia called their daughter hope brother brandom's wife first wife's name was hope is a't that right that's right because it's such a great thing our hope our only hope Christ is the only hope that there is and it's a solid rock on which each and every one of us stand on a daily basis amen praise the Lord amen God is good isn't he amen so when the storms and the winds beat on the ship no matter what it is maybe lukewarmness sits in you get away from God whatever it might be remember how many is glad that there's repentance I'm just glad there's a refreshing in the presence of God that you can go to him he's plent of in Mercy and
