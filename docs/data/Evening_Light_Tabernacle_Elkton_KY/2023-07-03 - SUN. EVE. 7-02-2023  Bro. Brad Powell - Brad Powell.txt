sin I'm happy [Music] and again oh free from sin I'm happy night and day oh it makes me shout well then no doubt and I know I'm bored ducky and Satan tells me that they thought that I got saved he tells me what a fool I have been with my mind goes that place where I pray through well I know that I've been lost again oh yes I'm bored foreign [Music] where it makes me Shout [Applause] well let's sing the course again if we could his brother Glenn comes tonight oh yes I'm bored again when I'm free from sin well I'm happy [Music] makes me shout before there's no doubting tomorrow [Music] well isn't it just wonderful day to have two services and sitting in this nice cool air conditioning is great amen thank the Lord for letting us invent air conditioning so anyway we're gonna sing a little song these ladies are gonna help me because I can't never do anything right by myself so but they're going to take care of me I promise so if you uh if you've ever wondered what Jesus was thinking about when he was on the cross guess what he was thinking about me brother Joe brother Tommy and everyone out here okay [Music] I've wondered what he was thinking of When the Crowds came that day [Music] took him from the garden and his disciples [Music] walked away what could have gone through his mind as they nailed him to the tree oh but now now I know [Music] he was thinking of me he was [Music] again because I messed up [Music] okay I got you now [Music] [Music] he had me on his mind all of the time so when I could be free it's hard to understand everybody [Music] there's Jesus on on the cross that day a multitude gathered around each one he was dying to save but he saw more than just that crowd [Music] for his mind went to the Future when he would hear this Sinner's plea for he knew I too would need a savior thank God he was thinking of me he was dating for me all the way to Calvary he had me on his mind all of the time [Music] it's hard to understand [Music] but now I can't see you he suffered and died so that I could have life he was thinking to love me [Music] oh Jesus has never failed me since I met him bad day and his spirit brings me Comfort when life Trials come my way [Music] [Music] and it blows eternally he paid it all though the cost was great Jesus Paid that price for me [Music] he was thinking of me [Music] free he had me on his mind all of the time so that I could be free it's hard to understand but now I can't sleep he suffered he was thinking of me he suffered and died so that I could have life thank you for your patience got it appreciate it you glad when he was on the cross we was on his mind tonight amen amen God bless you tonight and prayed the song service from the blessing to you and I stand the night and ask for the bread to come let's just sing that little course that mother Brad comes tonight fill my cup Lord amen fill my cup Lord amen oh fill my cup hello [Music] I lived there come on this Thursday [Music] thank you feed me till I want no more [Music] here's my cup feeling [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] heaven [Music] feed me till I wanna know more here's my cup and make me whole amen gonna be back in the house of the Lord this evening that'll be all for the music thank you musicians thank you so much for the good song service it seems like everything just ties together and I love it when when the Holy Spirit and the Lord worked that way and just keeps building the bomb and so we won't try to we'll try our best not to keep you long this afternoon and forgive me for this morning I I went um well I forgot we didn't have Sunday school and I just kept going by the clock and and took Liberty there to keep going by the clock but we we're thankful for what the Lord done for us this morning so he's on time and time means nothing to him so we're the ones that's Bound by time and the creatures of time and habit and space and but there will come a day when in a moment and a twinkling of an eye that'll be the last time the last time time will be a concern of ours amen so turn with me if you would in the Bibles in your Bibles to the Book of John again we'll go to chapter eight and we'll finish up what we started this morning and speaking on life liberty and the pursuit of happiness um pray for me for Wednesday night if you would uh I've been praying that the Lord would just if it was his will to open some doors for us and and so we we got an invitation to go to Brother Joseph Hammonds on Wednesday night um and so we're we're looking forward to that and and thankful for the invitation but a little anxious uh and and that as well being going out for the first time in several years so uh will you pray for me amen I appreciate it um and I know I know you'll have an amazing service here as well so the Book of John chapter 8 in verse 36 Jesus makes a wonderful statement here and a statement of Victory and he says if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for the day so far Lord and you've been such a blessing to us and you've spoke to our hearts today Lord and drawn Us close to to you father and we're thankful for the communion service where we were able to honor you and recognize you for the blood that was shed on Calvary for us for our sins that that as you look through down upon us Lord you see no sins but you see see us as clear and clean and we thank you for that Lord Jesus before we just ask the Lord that you just be in the service tonight and this little thought as we finish up this topic and and close out the thought here Lord we just ask that you would help Help the People your bride to be attentive and and and give them energy to be able to to uh withstand the the few minutes it will speak Lord that they could be taken into the word and and the word would Captivate them to a place that it would draw them close to you and myself as well Lord would you anoint my lips to speak what you would have laid on our heart we just want to tell you we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may have your seats if a son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed that's an amazing statement and goes right along with what we talked about this morning and brother Brown's talking in this message here where he's preaching and it says the message God talked to Moses and he said the Holy Ghost is moving on signs and wonders are following and demonstrations and powers of God and healings woo he says that's me he says that's what I like amen that's what I like and that's what the prophet says he's he likes those things he said he who the son has made free is free indeed he says no bondage no he says no you're free and Liberty where Christ has made you free that's right he says knock that little old hevite out of the way not that little ojedicide out of the way take that little low Canaanite and just kick him away so what he's telling us here is all these little be setting sins that just nag and pick and nag and poke and prod at you get rid of them just kick them away because you don't have to endure those anymore get them out of your life and kick them away he said don't let him live yeah don't let him live don't babysit those little things don't just carry and hold on to those little things and pet them you know sometimes we have our Petsense the little things in our life that we brush and we pet and we love and we nurture and we hold because oh I like this but God says don't do that kill it get rid of that sin in your life in that little thing kill him he says destroy him don't just say oh my dear little friend I'll be back to see you again as soon as Revival's over uh-oh how many times have we done that how many times do we as Believers if we're not careful we go to meetings we go to Services we go to the house of God on Sunday and we leave so energized so encouraged and so inspired to tackle the world just to tell our little sin just just wait till I get back home come on church we got to be beyond that we're in an age where we're beyond that he says don't never do that if you do that you will never get the promised land he says no take out your sword and go to fighting go to fighting and take those little things by the throat um so these are powerful and encouraging words that the prophet tells us and if you're free tonight give yourself a pat on the back everybody ought to be Patton amen because pat yourself on the back not because of anything you've done no not anything you've done but you can be proud as a Christian knowing that God thought about you before the foundation of the world and said you're more important to me than anybody else you realize that's the way God sees you brother Peter he sees you as more important than anybody else in this room for the joke you're more important than any each one of us has to recognize that God sees us as individuals and God wants our individual worship back to him so word free if you're free tonight you can be happy in that because that word free means to liberate it means to be exempt from liability do you hear what I said it means to be exempt from liability it means the things that you should be punished for the sins that you've done wrong and the punishment that should come for those sins you're exempt from the liability of that foreign he went to the Cross brother Glenn like you said he died and made you exempt that's where we get the song He Paid a Debt that I could never repay and that is Christ in this hour in this life we're living in if we read that we should really read like this the Sun liberates or exempts from liability will really be liberated and exempt from liability because consider two different conclusions first of all what has Christ freed you from what does he freed you from and then the second thing that I would look at tonight is what is Christ freed you to [Music] oh yeah when you get delivered there's a freedom that God begins to give you things it's just like the story on the checkbook and he can't just give you an open checkbook if you're not ready to handle an open checkbook but when you're free and you're within in the hands of God and God trusts you he can then allow you to write the checks whatever you have need of foreign we went to the or I I'm gonna pick on Carson for a minute he was at a a three-week governor scholar program we gave him a debit card and I talked about car Weston and his debit card at school well I guess he missed the service we're looking on our card statement and we've got like a thirty dollar charge for a Mountain Dew door Dash hey what what's going on up there I was thirsty I was hungry he using that card for doordash I need some fingernail clippers I said them fingernail clippers will cost you 150 don't you order no fingernail clippers through door Dash let them things grow out or bite them off but you had to get to a place to where God can trust you we live are the examples and God looks at us and he says I could trust him in this and I can trust him in that but right here I got to kind of put the brakes on for a little bit he's not quite ready for that but when we're freed there's Freedom there that God gives us things so looking at both sides of that coin they're both critical but what has Christ freed us from Christ has freed us from the bondage of sin sin no longer is your Captor you're no longer captive by sin because someone who is liberated let's loose the bound the bonds someone who's been liberated the change no longer Federal you're no longer tied down to a ball in a chain the way you used to drag it around and you used to walk like this and you used to say I had doubt I had sin I did this I had nicotine that's that's your sin I had alcohol I had drugs I had pornography and you began to realize that you're dragging these sins around but when you're free through the blood of Jesus Christ you drag those sins no more [Music] captive is one who's confined I'm not confined down to the things of this world you and I are not confined by the things of this world because God has promised us a better place that's what you're freed from sin what is it to conquer he says the prophet says conquering Victory is the same this is one of my favorite quotes I've used it many times the Conqueror means to beat down to override to handcuff or to throw into prison it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now you say when you come to the Cross things change in your life there's a turnaround something happens it gives you power and authority and the ability to say sin you no longer bind me I bind you get out of my house and so here you've you'll rule it now he says it means you've overcome it you've whipped it I like his I like his Kentucky grammar you've whipped it how many of us know what it means to whip something yeah yeah that means you ain't playing around when you don't whoop somebody you're done you know you don't open a can of Kentucky wolf on them and you don't whoop them and you put them into a place that they no longer look at you and say I'm going to try to try you again no they're not going to try you again when you whoop somebody they don't come back at you and that's the kind of power we have to have the prophet said oh I feel religious right now in our days before living in Christ we don't want to Harbor and look back and and bring up and relish and and those things we're not doing that tonight those things are gone but thinking thinking about the life before Christ whatever sin wanted sin got if sin wanted to get drunk you got alcohol if sin wanted nicotine you got tobacco if sin wanted to get high you got drugs those are what the things that sin did Sin God was sin wanted but now that you've made a turn in your life you took off the old coat and you put on a new coat and you see yourself in a different light that no longer are those things that are trying to get you gotcha sin can want all it can want but it has no place in this vessel Romans 6 tells us Paul tells us that sin at that time in your life was your master hmm but then that beauty happened and just like turning on a switch you say well it didn't happen to me like oh yes it did if you accepted Jesus Christ your life was changed instantly you may not have felt different you may not have sang different you may not have run different you may not have shouted different but if you truly accepted Jesus Christ it was a finished work right then and there God gave you a whole new nature and then more importantly that as time goes on he begins to fill you with you with his Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost in your life is is what takes over now and you're no longer under control of that sinful nature when you got that Holy Ghost that's when you're in control it no longer controls you when you've got the Holy Ghost and you're filled with the Holy Ghost that's when you're walking and you're telling sin what to do get out sin go here sin I'm not listening to you sin you can't tell me to go there you you can tell me but I'm not going I'm not watching I'm not listening there's a song I like and it's an old Pentecostal song and maybe most of you probably know but it's called two coats two coats I'm gonna read the lyrics to you I wish we could had it and could sing it but I need somebody a better singer than me but it says two coats were before me an old and a new and I asked my sweet master oh what must I do the old coat was ugly so tired and torn the other one a new one that had never been worn he said I'll tell you the best thing I ever did do was put off the old coat and put on the new listen to those lyrics I took off the old coat and put on the new he said the first man was Earthly made from the ground we all bore His Image the whole world around the next was my savior from heaven so fair he bought me this new coach you now see me where oh brothers or sisters that was a price paid for a life change in your life and Christ bought that and said here put this on it looks better on you because that filthy coat that filthy rags the the the the the the the dirt and the filth and the muck and the mire they never maybe your coat looked like it had never been washed and he says here's you a new garment to wear Paul sums it up and he says uh the Lord is the spirit and we're the spirit of the Lord is there is Freedom Liberty Freedom Liberty and freedom when you have this Freedom you are freed from the penalty of sin regardless if you want to believe it or not the book of Romans tells us the wages of sins death and we were all born into this world speaking lies we all had to go through that nature change and until you go through that nature change you don't know what I'm talking about because you know to be honest outside of Christ you had a death sentence and when you're living in sin and you're running and ripping and and snorting around through towns and so forth foreign the fact that you're invincible you tend to think that there's nothing that can harm you you tend to think that there's nothing going to stop you but they're wages of sin is death separation it's a you might as well have been living on death row can you imagine what it's like to be an inmate or a prisoner and you're living on death row that was you you ought to be able to imagine it because that was you that's what it was like before Christ came into your life and unfortunately I'm afraid there's too many people still living today that don't recognize the wages of sin because this world is going deeper and deeper and farther and farther into a world of sin and to a world of of of uh perversion that is not going to make it when men try to become women and women become men and homosexuality is rampant you know I used to be a little bit hesitant about preaching on that because I thought man that made you up come back and give me some backlash I don't care anymore the word is a word there was an Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve there is no way medically possible I know science I'm a nurse and I know there is no way medically possible for two men to have a baby there's no way medically possible for two women to have a baby it's not possible God didn't make it that way so why should I be ashamed to stand up here and say that's not right because this sin if somebody don't call it out how will they ever know you say well they'll hate you they'll resent you they'll talk about you they may make fun of you I don't care somebody's got to tell them truth and these pastors and preachers in this in the worldly denominations and maybe even I don't know I hope there's none in the message but it could be it says this is okay [Music] I hate it for him I hate it for him be sinners that I'm talking about they're proud yeah they have Liberty and they take Liberty they say what they want to say they do what they want to do they act the way they want to act in front of your kids or not promoted in front of kids that's Liberty they're taking their Liberty while they've got Liberty on Earth but there's someone today when they won't have that kind of Liberty because those kinds of that kind of life right there that lifestyle is going to lead to separation it's going to lead to a life of death and a life of darkness and a life and they're going to go down a path can you imagine the path that leads to that kind of Darkness think about it we talk about death but death is not anything real death is just a bluff to the believer like I said in my last time I preached up here death is just a bump in the road There Is No Death should not even be in the vocabulary of a Christian it's non-existent word because we step from life into eternity we don't step from life into death if we're stepping out we're stepping in the wrong places we're stepping from life into eternity can you imagine the separation imagine if you will you're in complete utter Darkness darkness that you can't even see the hand in front of your face and it's eerie and utterly silent just imagine this is the separation eerie silent lonely has anybody ever told these people this is the feeling they'll have so lonely brother Brown said he went pray for that that colored boy in Memphis I believe it was and said he walked in there what was he doing mama there was nobody there to comfort him there was nobody there to Pat him on the back there was nobody there to wrap their arms around him and he was laying there in that darkness and he said it's getting dark didn't tell what he said it's getting dark it's getting dark mama mama where are you can you imagine being in a place like that that will eventually only be turned to a life of Chaos foreign let me tell you can Rejoice today just thinking about that and knowing that you have eternal life a life of a life that goes on forever and ever and ever and you'll be in the very presence of God and you'll hear Angelic choirs sing and there will be just a vast amount of people that are praising God and worshiping God and loving on God can you imagine that ought to get you up and shouting that ought to make us run around the pews laughs you're free from that penalty of death you're free you've been freed from guilt and shame of your sin you've been free from the things that you did that you wish you could take back and you can't you're free from that our nature our our conscience wants to hold on to it and say yeah but you're free from that the things that you've done um they can haunt you they can you and that is one of Satan's biggest weapons against the believer as he begins to point fingers at you remember remember remember do you remember do you remember I remember that's what he'll tell you let me remind you and that is his biggest weapon as he begins to come down there and he encourages you look back on those shameful moments look back on all those shameful and condemnation that the life of condemnation that you live look back on that and relish that and remember it sisters we're freed from that when that blood was shed and dripped down on Calvary that blood covered every bit of that up and it's not even seen no more the devil may see it we know it's there but God said it's as though it never even happened so how can the devil remind you of things that God don't even know happened you've been set free that's your freedom brother Brown tells a story and I'm going to tell you this because we allow this to burden this maybe y'all don't I do I sometimes think and I think man this is this is a burden how how could God ever accept me with the things I used to do and sometimes I find that gets a little heavy on me and then I hear the story of what brother Brown was talking about the the woman and the man in the in the little gambling joint the little hole in the wall gambling joint you know what I'm talking about and he's looking at that and he's watching out and he says oh my God how can you stand to look down on such as this and he said the Lord call me behind the door can you imagine that come here yes sir yes sir he said he called me behind the door and I saw a vision and he said I saw the world in it turning and he said I saw that my sin and other people's sins was going up and I said God why don't you just blow this place up how can you stand it he said but then I seen around this world was a crimson stream around this world was a crimson stream and I seen the Lord Jesus standing there in all of his pity and he's looked down upon the Earth and I've seen my sins as they went up to him but that blood acted like a bumper never reaching no harm and he said I see that blood it acted like a bumper before God they could not come to him as though you never done it my sins they could not come up to him and he said I've seen every time I've done something wrong his blood which between me and the Judgment of God thank God thank God tonight for a blood bumper a barrier that covers Us and goes between us and a judgmental God who will judge this Earth and he said I walked up to him and I said Lord in the vision is this my sins doing that I said forgive me God I didn't mean to do it forgive me God I didn't mean to do it he said he stuck his hand in his side and reached over and got a little book that my name was written on and he said he got a little book that had my name written on it pardoned he wrote pardoned across it and he went put it on the shelf for a later rep S no no that's not what he said he said in the vision he took out a little book out of his side and it was William random's book and he wrote pardon on it he said he threw it behind him he threw it behind him and got rid of it into the sea of his forgetfulness that book today is in the bottom of the deepest depths of the ocean they won't take no submarine down there to find it and he said now I forgive you for your sins but what about you saying that about that woman um but we're free we're free from that we have freedom to live and when I'm talking about living I'm talking about living to the greatest capacity that that you could ever imagine in Christ we have the ability to live and we have to understand that when we're free from bondage and penalty and the guilt of sin it increases our capacity you know the prophet said that if there's a desire in your heart for more of God there's what more of God for you so when you find yourself that you are free you're free uh to live in God it opens up the capacity that makes your heart desire give me more God give me more God I want to worship more God I want to do more for you God I Want To Praise You More God and it begins to build in Your Capacity your heart just begins to swell and swell and swell and swell and swell it just come to me first message I preach was preach was heart of a thoroughbred and as you begin to fill up with God your heart as I said so how many knows the sectarian Secretariat at the Belmont Stakes I believe it is when he won by 32 links 34 links you ought to listen to the call it'll send Shields down you when the guy is talking about the horse begins to run and he's running and he's racing and he's giving and he's going more and he's getting stronger and stronger and the the horse is trying to Trail him and the big debate was he ends up beating him by 32 links the other horse wasn't even in the view of the camera they did an autopsy of Secretariat what makes this horse so different what gives him the drive what makes him so strong what gives him the energy and the endurance to run away from the field like never seen before still holds all three track records the the Belmont the Preakness the Kentucky Derby the Triple Crown records you know what he was it's hard the average horse heart weighs seven pounds Secretariat's heart weighed 22 pounds 22 pounds brothers and sisters as we get more of God in us and more of God in this and more of God in us we begin to find that we can run the race a little bit farther we can run the race a little bit faster we can find ourselves getting on around the track a little bit faster than our enemy can oh you remember in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve they sinned and when they sinned what was the first thing they did they hid they cover themselves and they hid themselves that's sin caused their capacity to be at a minimum because instantly they couldn't fellowship with God the way they used to fellowship with God so that's why it's so important that we don't allow these besetting things to hang around us that we don't find ourselves in places we shouldn't be or seeing things we shouldn't see hearing but we can go on and on and on and we've been talking about this all day but the importance of it is when Adam and Eve found themselves in that guilty state of mind because they knew they had done wrong they hid themselves and covered up and God then had to go looking for him Adam Adam do you think God was confused of where they were at no but thank God that God caused God had known exactly what had happened and God knows exactly will clear out the claw s because God knows it anyway don't find yourself held back from the from the from the goodness of God because there's not enough capacity in your heart because you're harboring and hiding a little low secret sins little secret sins that are not going to do nothing but tear you down get rid of those things in your life and open up and have more for God James says come near to God and he'll come near to you that's what freedom is I want to know that when I go with stand before God I can come freely before God and I don't have to hide myself I don't have to be in shame now you say are you perfect no no I'm far from perfect but I know when I do wrong just like you know when you do wrong you don't have to have somebody pick your life apart tell you now you know you shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't no no no your conscience tells you you know that little dub on this shoulder sits there and it sits there and it's just kind of cooing and cooing and cooing and all of a sudden it's gone where did it go what did I say what did I do that's my first question why do I feel the way I feel what did I do and instantly I say God forgive me I should not have done that I should not have said that I should have not have have partaken in this and in that little dove that's the way God works that's the way God operates when you have the freedom you also have the freedom to serve you know one of the biggest things that is also the one of the biggest things that God likes and requires but is one of the most challenging things for us to do is serve did you know that man you are quad y'all been pretty pretty pretty active until that I guess that turkey hit you hard or something serve servitude to be a servant of Christ to go out into the highways and the hedges and wait Dion did y'all scratch that out of y'all's book serving others being there for others when others are in need you find yourself serving when you're free you're able to do those things because God can then use you and brother says I want to be whatever God would have me to be I want to be that kind of servant that when God calls me to do this or to do that I'm available to go and I have no guilt on my conscience about doing it freedom to serve so brothers and sisters there's only one thing left to do and that's live free Galatians 5 it says to Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage you see that we all have to make a decision in our life I've had to make it you've had to make it if you haven't made it you will have to make it will you serve God or will you go the other way like our story this morning will you cleave to what God has said what you've heard all your life and when you begin to nurture it and and nourish that or will you turn your back and kiss him goodbye one thing about it when the decision is made when you go make that decision to serve Christ there's no looking back you can't look back you can't be in both places that's wishy-washy that's lukewarm and that God spews it out of his mouth there was a woman in the Bible you may have heard of her her name was Rahab anybody heard of Rahab you might think of her about her first thing you popped in your mind was her profession right yep when I said that name everybody thought prostitute harlot she made a decision this woman Rahab she was kind of like the relative that we don't want to talk about you know when you go to the family your family reunions that's the one you never bring up you don't talk about it she's filthy she's dirty she's living a life of prostitution she's found herself as a living as a harlot all of her life but Joshua sends out some spies the Book of Joshua tells us that he sent two men secretly it says go spy out the land and they came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab and they lodged there you see Brothers brothels and bars and red light districts they were reality back then too and these men go and they find themselves there to go find a place to rest their weary bodies you see Rahab was known as an Innkeeper so she's an Innkeeper well kind of like a kind of like that story brother Brown talks about that little gambling joint That was supposed to have been like a little restaurant a little cafe that was a front this was a front this was more than an and that Rahab was running she goes they go in there and they begin to to get in there and and and and Rahab who says she's the Inn Keeper living the life of prostitution now Life as a harlot she looks at these two spies and God had spoken something to her heart the prophet didn't stay there did you think about that the preacher didn't stay there the prophet didn't say there there was not a man sent from God before these two so God had spoken to her heart and she looked at those two men and she said I know that the Lord has given you the land and the fear has fallen upon us and all the inhabitants of the land because they will melt away before you hmm we've hurt we have heard my people has heard my family has heard how the land how the seed dried up into dry land and Moses went across with chariots yes thousands of people walked across we've heard about that we've heard about it when the two kings of the amorites who were just beyond Jordan we had heard how you destroyed them we've heard this we've heard it in our hearts have melted um can you imagine Rahab as she said there and she's talking to these two guys and then all of a sudden they hear a knock on the door nobody can know you're here open up Rahab we've seen them we know you got them who you're looking for their spies in your house there's nobody here I don't know what you're talking about we saw him come up here we know they're here we know you're having business with them why are they we want them we want them right now I don't know what you're talking about you can allow you want Rahab you can make this up but let me tell you one thing we're going to go get more help and we're coming back we will find those guys and can you imagine when the door closed and Rahab said hurry they're gonna kill you hurry hurry get out the window get out the back door go down get down but but we want to be able to do something for you Rahab you've been so good to us you've hit us what are we gonna do here right here yeah when The Invasion comes you hang that out your window and we will tell every man under the Army under the nation of God Almighty whatever you do don't you touch that Scarlet rope because that Scarlet rope has been under the blood that Scarlet rope has heard from all sin it hides her from all iniquity it hides her from all transgression and whatever you do don't you hurt that odds people how does a harlot go from being a harlot to God's people I don't know but God said it it's in his plan bear that road that rope hangs outside her window and because of this because of what Ray have it done in her life her life will come make a complete change a complete 180. she's no longer oh we hear her name we call it harlot in the Bible you know it's even in the book of Hebrews in the chapter 11 number 30 and verse 31 or something like that I think and they have Harley who saved the spies you know why she's mentioned as a harlot she's mentioned as a harlot not because that's what she was no it's well or not because that's what she is but it's because of what she was for Christ came into her life and it tells each one of us when we open this book it turned to Hebrews chapter 11 that no matter how sinful your life was no matter what mock admire and no matter what distress you found your life in you're good enough for God all you've got to do is accept God and hang out the Scarlet Road it's not for me to decide if she's too filthy it's not up to me to decide if you've lived too vulgar too rough a life that's not for me to decide it's for me to tell you the word and the word says that you can be free [Music] this woman getting ready to close now think about this this woman Rahab her faith in God and grafted her into a new family rehab soon became into the physical family of Israel she became the wife of salmon one of the leaders of Israel who supported Moses when he left Egypt she's she's moving up in ranks and Rahab and Simone you can read about them all through the Old and New Testament but this woman who had been a harlot became a Godly wife a mother in the lineage of Israel salmon and Rahab became the parents of a little boy named Boaz remember him from this morning you mean they're the ones that began Boaz I know we skipped that a lot in our Bibles Flip Flip Flip but it's in there you'll find in the first chapter of Matthew Simone father Boaz by Rahab and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth and oh bad father Jesse and Jesse father David you mean to tell me the great great great grandmother of our Lord and Savior Jesus Jesus Christ who died on the cross for the entire sins of the entire world his great-grandmother was a prostitute um don't hear that often do we what does that say about how much God loves you when you look at your life and you say there's nothing for me to do there's no hope for me I've gone too far I can't find myself out of this pickle you know we have a family in baseball that's what we call it pickle as when a runner gets caught between two bases and you're trapped and this Runner this person's got the ball and you're running this way he throws it and you run back this way they got the ball chasing you they throw it and you run back this way you're in a pickle how many's ever felt like Satan has you in your life end up self running here and then you're running this way and then you're constantly trying to dodge it let me tell you Jesus Christ is the answer Jesus Christ remember that woman with the scarlet cord when you think you're insignificant when you think God confuse you when you think you've gone too far when you think your children have gone too far when you think your loved ones will never be able to get back in you know preachers always want to call talk about that Mercy line that's not made to judge there is a line where you cross that you can't come back but there's also a place called Calvary they can completely transform your life and that's where Rahab was remember the Scarlet cool brother Adam said also I remember red in the Bible is a covering red is an atonement red is safety safe behind the Scarlet red he said Remember the Harlot Rahab let the spies down on that red string to safety there's always safety under red the blood is red you take your scientific research take a red piece of cellophane and look through it through a red piece of cellophane at red letters and it's white you take red through red it's white he said well no wrongdoings are read though your sins be like Scarlet though through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus God is looking through their red looking through red that bumper thank God for the bumper tonight there is your righteousness he'll never see it your good works he'll never know it until you come beneath the blood then he sees you as his own beloved Son or daughter there's your answer to Rahab her sins which were many though her sins be like Scarlet he looked down and said I don't see nothing but a grandmother in my lineage can you imagine God's good to us you love the Lord tonight stand with me I told you I wasn't gonna keep you too long I don't think I did rahab's Faith saved her family it changed her listen now remember this it changed her from a woman of the night into a woman of the light God is good to us let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we're just so thankful Lord to be in your presence and we trust that we haven't wear it and wore down the people tonight Lord we trust that they would take home words that can glean from Lord that will just help us to recognize who we are and what that blood covering has done for us in our lives and how that blood covering Keeps Us close father and and how that blood covering gives us a a new life a new coat so to speak that we don't have to live the old life anymore then we've beyond that we've surpassed that we don't have to look back at the old things and because those things don't exist they're non-existent in your very eyes father there have been thrown into the sea of your forgetfulness and God we're so thankful for the little book that our Prophet told us about that has our name on it and every sin that I've ever committed in my life and underneath that pardon was written and thrown into the sea of your forgetfulness thank you Lord go with us we pray throughout this week continue to bless the church and Lord May our praise and our worship continue to grow and to be pleasing into your ears and in May our lives that we live be pleasing in your sight Lord we love you with all of our hearts in Jesus name amen can we sing that song sister Becky I'm a new creation [Music]
