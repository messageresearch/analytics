[36:47] speak on deceived worship deceived
[36:52] worship amen more or less a negative
[36:55] message amen
[36:57] amen so we know that when you're talking
[36:59] about the bride of Christ when we're
[37:01] talking about the light there should be
[37:04] light in the evening time and how that
[37:07] God is perfecting a church and getting
[37:08] it all ready for him to take away we
[37:11] know there's another side of it we know
[37:13] there's another church isin't that right
[37:16] amen that is deceived and so we want to
[37:19] look at Deception with the little help
[37:21] of the Lord deception and I was telling
[37:23] my wife on the way to uh on the way to
[37:27] coming com here amen just thinking
[37:29] about uh how
[37:32] easy it is to be deceived amen very easy
[37:37] much easier than what you might think as
[37:40] a matter of fact on might statement
[37:42] beginning and that is there's only one
[37:44] way really that you'll not be
[37:46] deceived and that's through the holy
[37:49] spirit amen because you can't even see
[37:51] the kingdom of God right without being
[37:54] born again Jesus said you can't even see
[37:56] it so if you're not changed in your
[37:58] nature and in your thinking most of the
[38:01] time people that that are wrong think
[38:03] they're right amen and so amen we know
[38:06] that there's going to be a lot of that
[38:07] Amen on the day of judgment it's people
[38:10] who thought they were right and were not
[38:12] amen so amen we're going to begin with
[38:15] the devil's ambition in Isaiah
[38:18] 14 and verse
[38:22] 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh
[38:25] Lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[38:27] down to the ground which D weaken the
[38:29] Nations for thou has said in thine heart
[38:32] I will Ascend into heaven and I will
[38:33] exalt is that word
[38:36] exalt my name my Throne oh my my throne
[38:40] above the stars of God and will sit also
[38:43] in the Mount of the congregation in the
[38:45] sides of the north I will Ascend above
[38:47] the heights of the clouds and I will be
[38:50] like the most high may God add His
[38:52] blessings to reading of the word you can
[38:54] be
[38:55] seated this evening
[39:00] amen amen in 2 Thessalonians 2 and verse
[39:04] 3 and 4 it says let no man deceive you
[39:07] by any
[39:09] means for that day shall not come except
[39:11] there come a falling away first And that
[39:13] son of and that man of sin be
[39:17] revealed the son of predition who
[39:20] opposes and exalteth himself above all
[39:25] that is called God or that is worship
[39:28] there's that word worship again amen
[39:31] remember we're talking about deceived
[39:33] Worship in other words amen they're
[39:35] worshiping but they're deceived about
[39:37] what they're
[39:38] worshiping amen so that he as God sth in
[39:42] the temple of God brother Brandon makes
[39:44] a direct quote and very direct statement
[39:47] so he's in the church he's a church is
[39:52] that right that's where he is
[39:55] amen sth in the temple of God showing
[39:58] himself that he is God so the ultimate
[40:04] goal of the devil is to be
[40:08] worshiped amen that's his goal and we
[40:13] realize let me just uh read your quote
[40:16] right quick Satan's eating brother bam
[40:19] says he said that he would exalt himself
[40:21] above the most high he would he would
[40:24] Ascend above the clouds and the Stars
[40:28] and he would sit there like God and be
[40:31] above the most
[40:33] high and he has succeeded in carrying
[40:36] out his threats imagine a prophet of God
[40:40] coming along and making a statement that
[40:43] he has now
[40:44] succeeded in other words he has achieved
[40:48] his ambition his
[40:50] goal he's achieved it and we want to
[40:53] carefully Look Tonight with the help of
[40:55] the Lorden how he does that amen praise
[41:00] the
[41:02] Lord all right he has certainly
[41:04] succeeded in carrying out his threats he
[41:07] has certainly had a marvelous success in
[41:11] carrying out his threats by the people
[41:14] letting him explain away in every age
[41:18] the value of God's promised word for
[41:21] that age amen with the help of the Lord
[41:25] we'll talk about a little bit about
[41:27] one way that he does deceive people is
[41:29] he allows them to live in the glare of
[41:32] another age or um what is it say to
[41:36] believe what God has done in the
[41:39] past all right to believe what God has
[41:42] done in the past but reject what he does
[41:45] in the present is to worship the
[41:50] devil I hope everybody out there hears
[41:53] this to believe what God has done in the
[41:56] past but refuse use what he has done in
[41:58] the in front of you is to worship the
[42:02] devil amen my my praise the Lord a
[42:07] pretty strong statement but it's true
[42:09] notice this brother baham says now go
[42:11] back in Genesis which is the beginning
[42:13] Genesis means beginning we find that God
[42:15] gave his family eternal life as long as
[42:18] they stayed in this word and lived by
[42:22] this word but when they broke it just
[42:24] one link of that chain of promises
[42:27] struck him which is a promise also it's
[42:30] a chain you're hanging over hell with it
[42:33] and that's the only thing that'll carry
[42:35] you through when the believer becomes a
[42:37] makeb Believer and lives on one word
[42:40] that's contrary to this word he cuts off
[42:44] his fellowship with
[42:46] God how many believes that if Eve he
[42:50] took Eve Adam and Eve out because of
[42:52] that one word brother B says that God's
[42:55] not going to take you back unless you're
[42:56] believe leing every word Jesus said and
[43:00] he makes a statement man shall not live
[43:02] by bread alone but by every word that
[43:06] proceeds out of the mouth of God a real
[43:08] genuine believer has to believe every
[43:11] word that God has
[43:13] spoke to dis believe one word well it
[43:17] doesn't mean that you just you're
[43:19] worshiping the
[43:20] devil the devil has done exalted himself
[43:23] as soon as they say well that was for
[43:25] another age there's no hope Holy Ghost
[43:27] is you done worshiping the devil because
[43:29] you have brought the devil's knowledge
[43:31] and wisdom above God's word remember
[43:35] he'll be above the stars and and his
[43:37] throne's going to be above God and so he
[43:41] has a say over top of God's word exalts
[43:45] him
[43:47] amen oh my all right so I'm going to
[43:51] iPad it tonight a little bit with the
[43:53] help of the
[43:54] Lord amen
[43:58] can't always do this but whenever I have
[44:00] a message coming quotes coming out of
[44:02] one message and this will be out of
[44:05] Satan's Eden and the God of this evil
[44:07] age Amen brother Brandon first of all he
[44:11] Mak says it this way I wanted to speak
[44:13] to to you
[44:14] something well let me back up just a
[44:17] little bit first of all let's first of
[44:20] all talk I wanted to first of all talk
[44:22] about how I
[44:24] believe that the Bible is inspired how
[44:26] many the Bible is
[44:29] inspired every word of this is
[44:32] inspired
[44:34] amen and over here's the
[44:37] message let me ask you is it
[44:42] inspired it's
[44:44] inspired amen how many how many knows
[44:47] I've read the church age book brother
[44:49] Dale Potter's read the church age book
[44:50] many preachers preach out in church book
[44:52] and it there's an inspiration that goes
[44:55] with it I know preachers and the message
[44:57] don't believe the church age book is
[44:59] really legit because of Lil writing it
[45:03] this out and what they know about but I
[45:04] know one thing that's a it's
[45:07] inspired I preach out of it and I
[45:09] believe it brother brandom never
[45:11] disavowed it is that right and I believe
[45:15] it and so I believe the message is
[45:19] inspired I believe when we read these
[45:21] quotes it's
[45:23] inspired just like the Bible is
[45:25] inspired aren't you glad for that and I
[45:28] want to make the statement you know and
[45:30] and you know with what God did through
[45:31] the prophet's Ministry and all that he
[45:33] did and and raising the dead and Healing
[45:36] The Sick and pointing us right back to
[45:37] that word I've got a lot of confidence
[45:40] his word carries a lot of weight how
[45:43] many believes the prophet's word carries
[45:45] a lot of
[45:46] weight because Jesus Christ would come
[45:48] on the platform and back it up any man
[45:51] that can say if Jesus Christ don't come
[45:54] and do what he did when he walked the
[45:55] shores of Galilee and Hiser and all that
[45:57] you ain't got to believe it is that
[46:01] right but if he does does vindicate it
[46:05] then it's sin for you not to believe
[46:08] it I'll dare say I want to make another
[46:11] statement tonight that I believe that
[46:13] the only way that you're not going to be
[46:16] deceived is through the message of the
[46:18] hour that's how vital it
[46:21] is well brother B you better have
[46:24] scripture for it
[46:28] huh all right y'all run to scripture for
[46:30] it I'll give you scripture for it
[46:33] Revelations 18 we know there's God came
[46:35] down and he declared he cried with a
[46:38] mighty and a strong voice saying Babylon
[46:40] the great is Fallen is fallen and he
[46:42] become the habitation of devils and the
[46:45] hold of every foul Spirit and the cage
[46:48] of every unclean and hateful bird for
[46:50] all nations have drunk of the wine of
[46:52] the wrath of her fornication and the
[46:54] kings of the Earth have committed
[46:55] fornications with her notice her how
[46:58] many now go preach half an hour on what
[47:01] brother bam said a woman type and how
[47:03] that she's the only one that could fall
[47:05] she's the only one that could commit
[47:07] fornication no Horse no cow no other no
[47:11] other female can commit
[47:13] fornication ain't that right she was
[47:16] created to where she
[47:18] could ain't that right so how much
[47:20] greater is it than if she could she
[47:23] don't anyway how many believes that's
[47:25] the bride though she could she don't
[47:27] want to she won't anyway that gives her
[47:30] an extra uh extra
[47:33] reward but no doubt but we realize that
[47:36] a church or a woman is the type of the
[47:40] church over in seven chapter 17 and
[47:44] verse three it says he carried me away
[47:46] into the spirit in the wilderness and I
[47:48] saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored
[47:51] Beast full of names of blasphemy having
[47:54] seven heads and 10 horns and we won't
[47:56] even go into that but he talk called her
[47:59] mysty Babylon the great the mother of
[48:01] harlots and the Abominations of the
[48:03] earth we know that there's only one city
[48:05] sitting on a Seven Hills that's of
[48:06] course Catholicism she is the mother
[48:10] Church she is the
[48:12] Harlot and she had little harlots isn't
[48:15] that right the mother of harlots now oh
[48:18] notice over here this Babylon had fallen
[48:22] oh boy has she ever fallen ain't that
[48:25] right now now condoning LGB stuff gays
[48:29] and lesbians and all that and condoning
[48:31] all that by
[48:33] Catholicism and that right and her
[48:35] little prostitute little little strong
[48:39] word but
[48:40] hard God didn't hold back did he we
[48:43] shouldn't hold back she called her a
[48:46] bunch of committing fornication and so
[48:48] forth and now they are even allowing all
[48:51] of that stuff in become a hold of every
[48:53] foul Spirit unclean bird now to make my
[48:57] point how many believes in order amen
[48:59] that God is going to do something to
[49:01] cause you not to be in all of that all
[49:04] right all right and the merchants of the
[49:07] earth verse three of chapter 18 says and
[49:09] the merchants of the earth that wax Rich
[49:11] through the abundance of her Delicacies
[49:14] and I
[49:15] heard somebody say I
[49:18] heard and I heard another
[49:22] voice say from Heaven saying come out of
[49:26] of her if you're not part of that voice
[49:29] that come out of her then how are you
[49:32] ever not going to be deceived the only
[49:34] thing that'll give you the wisdom and
[49:35] the understanding is the baptism of the
[49:37] Holy Ghost Amen to be able to to discern
[49:41] and withand that Antichrist
[49:44] spirit amen the message of the hour I
[49:48] truly believe the only thing that an
[49:50] ability to be able to not be
[49:53] deceived amen
[49:57] my praise the
[49:59] Lord my my my all right so there's your
[50:04] scripture talking about there's a voice
[50:06] that says come out so we know brother
[50:08] bham how many remembers come out
[50:10] remember he said come out of her my
[50:12] people that what the voice said Mighty
[50:15] Angel Mighty voice said come out of her
[50:18] don't be partakers of her sins that you
[50:20] receive not of
[50:24] plagues all right all right now let me
[50:27] back get back to my quote I just wanted
[50:29] to say that just to kind of lay a
[50:32] foundation to make us realize that I
[50:35] love reading the
[50:37] quotes it's
[50:40] inspired God oh boy here we go I can't
[50:43] get off it God backed it up why
[50:45] shouldn't
[50:48] we Jesus backed it
[50:53] up you're going to be in trouble
[50:55] people's going to be in trouble that
[50:56] don't believe what Jesus backed
[50:59] up I'm not ashamed of what God Said
[51:03] Amen so brother Braham speaking here God
[51:07] of this evil
[51:09] age I want to speak to you to bring
[51:11] something to Enlighten you to the
[51:14] promise of God for this age amen one to
[51:19] Enlighten you not something that
[51:22] somebody else was done in some other
[51:24] age them things are all right we refer
[51:27] to those things but I thought I would
[51:29] try to bring something to your mind with
[51:31] these scriptures that I got here a lot
[51:34] of the things the ones I read already
[51:36] that would Enlighten you to know to make
[51:39] you a better Soldier for the field that
[51:41] you're fighting in now to learn the
[51:44] tactics of the enemy so that you can
[51:46] block everything before it gets to you
[51:49] see that's the main thing is to learn
[51:51] how to keep the punches off of you as
[51:54] much as you can
[51:57] I like that to be a better Soldier to
[52:00] learn the tactics to to make sure that
[52:02] he doesn't deceive
[52:05] you most deceptive age ever is what you
[52:08] and I are are are living in
[52:13] amen now I notice so now let us look at
[52:16] this great for a few minutes great
[52:18] sinful day that we're now living in I
[52:20] don't believe there ever was a day that
[52:22] we've ever lived in
[52:24] history amen I'm just it's going to stop
[52:27] there the great sinful day that we're
[52:29] living in not only in Morality but also
[52:33] in the Sin of
[52:35] unbelief how many's with me there's so
[52:38] much unbelief of what God has done in
[52:40] this
[52:43] generation more sin than
[52:46] ever Jesus walked the shores of Galilee
[52:49] isn't that right amen it preached to
[52:52] just so many brother B said just 100th
[52:55] of 1% maybe ever knew that he was even
[52:57] here but what about the prophet going
[53:00] world over Africa India half a million
[53:03] at a time through the media ain't that
[53:05] right through everything we have to
[53:07] spread that gospel now they can hear it
[53:10] so much more and then they either have
[53:12] to accept it or they have to reject it
[53:15] they'll either Believe it or they will
[53:17] sin and not believe
[53:27] oh my never has there been a greater day
[53:30] now listen there's been greater days of
[53:33] persecution when the children of God was
[53:35] put to death on every
[53:38] hand but to see the deceitfulness of the
[53:41] en we've never had a day like this that
[53:43] we're living in now it's the most
[53:44] cunning deceitful day and when you see
[53:47] that it brings this that the Christian
[53:48] has to be more on his toe today than he
[53:51] has in any other age now they back in
[53:53] the days of the persecution of R and to
[53:56] the Church a chrisan made a mistake he
[53:58] went into the arena and was fed to the
[54:01] Lions perhaps you had to be careful not
[54:03] to come out not to be caught you had to
[54:05] hide in the kind of catacombs or hide
[54:08] this out or the other but if you got
[54:10] caught a't that right they found out
[54:13] even going on a bus different ones that
[54:15] got caught talking on a bus and and
[54:18] talking to a priest and they exposed
[54:20] themselves as a Christian and that
[54:21] priest when he got off would have him
[54:23] arrested and taken and killed they had
[54:26] be careful a't that right but listen to
[54:29] what the prophet of God is trying to say
[54:31] he says listen they would make a mistake
[54:33] he went into the arena and was fed to
[54:35] Lions or something like that when they
[54:37] found him of being a Christian for his
[54:39] testimony but his soul was saved because
[54:41] he was a purely unadulterated believer
[54:44] in God and gladly sealed his testimony
[54:46] with his blood as the veins let loose
[54:49] holes in his body perhaps a lion or a
[54:52] blade or whatever it is and the blood
[54:54] bled out and he would scream with royal
[54:56] fa
[54:56] and say receive my spirit oh Lord Jesus
[55:00] but now the cunningness of the devil now
[55:03] makes people believe that they are
[55:05] Christian when they are
[55:09] not let me tell you something oh you'll
[55:12] get to it there is the thing you don't
[55:15] have to se seal it's a more cunning day
[55:18] than it would be that when you had to
[55:21] seal your life away with your testimony
[55:23] the devil has set every cunning trap
[55:26] that he can he's a
[55:28] deceiver he told us in Matthew 24 how
[55:31] that this day would be that we're living
[55:33] is the most deceitful day that we ever
[55:35] lived how many believes that let me
[55:38] quickly read that Matthew 24:24 says it
[55:41] this
[55:45] way then if any man shall say unto you
[55:48] Lo here is Christ there is Christ bre
[55:50] believe it not for there shall arise
[55:52] false Christ how many knows but false
[55:54] anointed once brother talked about he
[55:56] people will be falsely anointed they
[55:59] will be true anointed but they will be
[56:02] false
[56:03] vessels amen that's how he explained it
[56:06] they're false christs amen and false
[56:10] prophets and shall show great signs and
[56:14] wonders in so much that if it were
[56:16] possible they shall deceive the very
[56:21] elect praise the Lord how many's glad to
[56:25] believe that you are
[56:27] elect if you are elect then you don't
[56:30] want you want to make sure you're not
[56:34] deceived
[56:35] amen my my we see that it is
[56:41] truly only the elect that deceived is so
[56:47] deceiving and we don't want to go too
[56:50] far in it but we realize that that
[56:51] number is
[56:52] little straight is the gate and narrow
[56:55] is the way and few there be that find
[56:59] it remember brother bam I believe it was
[57:01] a vision or a dream one that he had of a
[57:03] woman amen trying to go up to heaven
[57:06] make it Heaven on this road with high
[57:08] heeled shoes and he said you can't do it
[57:10] with that you can't make it oh be quiet
[57:12] I can die yeah I can yeah I can There
[57:15] She Goes Ming and so forth with her high
[57:17] heels and after a while she stumbles and
[57:19] off she
[57:21] goes huh well I guess that should take
[57:24] care of her preach us preaching on high
[57:25] heels then wouldn't it don't have to
[57:28] worry about that
[57:30] anymore amen but there's things that you
[57:32] know people think they can do and so
[57:34] forth you know but that's right now um
[57:38] let me just go again one more scripture
[57:40] that I'll clear up here on on those only
[57:45] those who uh only those who are elected
[57:48] will not be deceived and all that dwell
[57:50] upon the Earth shall worship Him
[57:52] Revelations 13 and8 and all that dwell
[57:56] upon the Earth shall worship remember
[57:59] we're talking about deceived
[58:02] worship they shall worship Him whose
[58:06] names are not written in the Book of
[58:08] Life of the lamb slain from the
[58:10] foundation of the
[58:12] world
[58:14] wow
[58:16] amen praise the Lord so we realize that
[58:19] it was easy maybe just to give you life
[58:21] in that hour but in this hour you're
[58:24] going to have to be on your turn
[58:26] new I wanted to go into it and didn't
[58:29] didn't but I'll just mention it amen how
[58:31] that how that the devil is out to kill
[58:35] to steal and destroy and I'm sure
[58:38] probably every one of us would like to
[58:40] know everything there is to know about
[58:41] the devil coming and trying to ride you
[58:45] and steal from you deceive you isn't
[58:49] that right that's all he wants to do is
[58:52] kill deceive and and so
[58:55] forth
[58:56] amen praise the
[58:59] Lord now notice so he says now we read
[59:03] also in Revelations 3 and4 rather the
[59:06] layad of see a church age that how at
[59:08] the church in these last days it says
[59:11] that it would sit a wiow and have need
[59:13] of nothing now I think that's actually
[59:14] found way further back in Revelation 17
[59:18] or somewhere talking about I said a
[59:20] queen and I'm no you know I'm a widow
[59:22] and I have need of nothing but he ties
[59:24] it in with that same woman
[59:26] and increase with
[59:28] Goods let's look at that for just a
[59:30] minute we're going to take our time on
[59:32] this one amen we're all familiar with it
[59:37] Revelations 3 and we'll begin with verse
[59:41] 15 I Know Thy works that thou art
[59:43] neither cold nor hot I would thou word
[59:45] cold or hot so then because Thou Art
[59:48] lukewarm and neither cold or hot I will
[59:50] spew thee out of my
[59:54] mouth before we read any further we're
[59:56] talking about what brother bam said
[59:58] about there'll be people that think that
[1:00:00] they are Christians and they're
[1:00:05] not I want to go down this road here but
[1:00:08] that's why I want to say that it's so
[1:00:11] important that we have that we check
[1:00:15] up about what kind of fruit that we're
[1:00:17] paying ain't that right let me just read
[1:00:20] this and we'll go over there to that
[1:00:21] part because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:00:23] increased with goods and have need of
[1:00:25] nothing knowest not that thou artart
[1:00:27] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:00:29] blind and naked am me go down to verse
[1:00:32] 19 we're going to stop this other and as
[1:00:35] I many as I love I rebuke and be zealous
[1:00:38] therefore and repent behold I stand at
[1:00:40] the door and knock If any man hear my
[1:00:43] voice I will come into to him and will s
[1:00:45] with him and he with me let me finish
[1:00:49] this quote now notice he says the last
[1:00:51] phrase the last word is what makes it so
[1:00:53] striking they think that they were well
[1:00:55] filled with with the spirit they're
[1:00:57] already the leosia age is the
[1:01:00] Pentecostal age because it's the last
[1:01:03] Church age Luther had his message Wesley
[1:01:05] had his message Pentecost message also I
[1:01:08] said that because that you're lukewarm
[1:01:11] neither cold nor hot amen the emotions
[1:01:14] of the outside the mental conception of
[1:01:16] the gospel because he said you're that
[1:01:18] way and I'm going to spew you out of my
[1:01:21] mouth in other words it made him sick to
[1:01:24] see the church in that condition
[1:01:26] remember they spewed him
[1:01:28] out how many knows that they had put him
[1:01:32] out in this age I stand at the
[1:01:35] door anytime that you put Christ the
[1:01:39] word out you're worshiping the devil
[1:01:43] thinking you're worshiping
[1:01:45] God how those Pentecostals after brother
[1:01:48] bam declared they are dead Methodist
[1:01:50] dead Baptist Dead all them denomination
[1:01:53] he said
[1:01:54] dead now there was a time he didn't say
[1:01:57] that because they was God was still in
[1:01:59] there but after they rejected him and
[1:02:01] after they put Christ on the
[1:02:03] outside they came and they had speaking
[1:02:06] in tongues they had beat up piano they
[1:02:09] had dancing they had shouting they still
[1:02:11] do today but they're there worshiping
[1:02:14] the devil thinking they're worshiping
[1:02:20] God my whole thought came from what
[1:02:23] brother Braham said about there'll be
[1:02:25] millions and
[1:02:27] billions worshiping the devil thinking
[1:02:30] they're worshiping God why brother
[1:02:32] Brandon would say that that amount of
[1:02:35] people deception
[1:02:38] amen all right we're
[1:02:41] gonna take our time but I think we
[1:02:44] should be pretty close Okay so listen
[1:02:48] they spewed him out and he was on the
[1:02:50] outside of church trying to get back on
[1:02:51] the inside in that awful lead ofia age
[1:02:55] the guy out of this world today
[1:02:58] worshiped the worship person of this
[1:03:01] world today is
[1:03:04] Satan and the people are ignorant of
[1:03:07] worshiping
[1:03:15] Satan I want to say something they use
[1:03:18] to they sing the same gospel songs that
[1:03:20] you
[1:03:22] sing they read out of the same Bible
[1:03:25] that you
[1:03:27] they talk about the Lord Jesus like you
[1:03:29] talk about the Lord Jesus
[1:03:32] hello amen but yet they're actually
[1:03:36] worshiping the
[1:03:38] devil because all it takes is one word
[1:03:41] you just reject one word of God one
[1:03:46] word my that's pretty
[1:03:49] strong listen they are ignorant of
[1:03:52] worshiping Satan but it's Satan imperson
[1:03:54] himself as the church
[1:03:56] see as the church they worship Satan
[1:03:59] thinking that they are worshiping God
[1:04:01] through that church remember better bam
[1:04:04] said you know that a woman is more
[1:04:07] deceiving than any bar or any beer joint
[1:04:09] or all of that is that right not and not
[1:04:14] so it's naturally that way but he said
[1:04:17] the implication that he was making he
[1:04:18] says it's the church that's more
[1:04:21] deceiving than anything else is that
[1:04:23] what he said the church is the most dece
[1:04:25] receiving
[1:04:26] institution on the face of the
[1:04:29] Earth cuz people go in there they want
[1:04:31] to serve God is't that right but yet
[1:04:34] they are deceived by it
[1:04:38] wow
[1:04:40] amen it's strong but it's the
[1:04:44] truth and all they have to do is well
[1:04:47] our church don't teach it that
[1:04:51] way all right worship the devil then
[1:04:55] that's exactly what's going to happen
[1:04:57] when they do when they say that we don't
[1:04:59] believe that I don't believe that that
[1:05:01] was for another day you're worshiping
[1:05:02] the devil right there rejecting the
[1:05:06] truth oh my it's going to get good are
[1:05:09] you ready it's going to get better yet
[1:05:12] look back to my text now wait a minute
[1:05:15] so uh now notice they're worshiping
[1:05:17] Satan thinking they are worshiping God
[1:05:19] through the church but it's the way
[1:05:20] Satan done it oh you see but wait a
[1:05:23] minute you say but wait a minute we
[1:05:24] preach the word look back there at my
[1:05:26] text Satan was the one that preached the
[1:05:28] word first to Eve a't that right he
[1:05:31] preached the word sure he
[1:05:35] did oh but that it doesn't really mean
[1:05:39] that that's all you got to say there you
[1:05:42] go swallowed the devil's lie doesn't
[1:05:45] really mean what it
[1:05:48] says makes you feel like slapping
[1:05:52] somebody right you telling me God
[1:05:54] doesn't his God's word doesn't really
[1:05:56] mean what he
[1:05:57] says what are you a fool God does mean
[1:06:01] what he says if there's anybody that you
[1:06:03] better listen to It's when God speaks
[1:06:05] don't worry about when man speaks but if
[1:06:07] God says something you better take heed
[1:06:09] if he said said you better man shall not
[1:06:11] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:06:13] that proceedes out of the mouth of God
[1:06:15] Amen shall Man live by then you better
[1:06:16] live by every word you better believe
[1:06:19] every
[1:06:20] word oh my let me see here
[1:06:25] so listen so that's right so he says
[1:06:28] it's that misconstrued that part of the
[1:06:30] scripture that applies to today he'll
[1:06:33] let you know all Jesus did was perfectly
[1:06:35] well he'll let you know that all that
[1:06:37] Moses did was perfectly well he'll but
[1:06:40] when you take the promises that they
[1:06:42] gave for this day
[1:06:44] amen listen that this day he says then
[1:06:48] that was applied to another age that's
[1:06:50] just all he has to do see is to get the
[1:06:53] people to believe it that way that's
[1:06:56] all amen you cannot take one word away
[1:06:59] from it or add one word to it or your
[1:07:02] part will be taken out of the book of
[1:07:06] life people ignorantly worshiping Satan
[1:07:10] thinking they're worshiping God as they
[1:07:12] are warned by prophecy in 2
[1:07:15] Thessalonians amen he says then he reads
[1:07:18] it and so
[1:07:20] forth amen let no man deceive you by any
[1:07:22] means for that they shall not come
[1:07:24] except they come of Falling Away first
[1:07:25] first amen that deceitfulness of the
[1:07:29] Church of today see the son of predation
[1:07:32] the devil the son of predition the devil
[1:07:34] people worshiping Satan in this day
[1:07:37] thinking they're worshiping God and
[1:07:39] they're worshiping him through a
[1:07:43] Creed a manmade denominations and Creeds
[1:07:47] that brought people right back down to
[1:07:49] the greatest deception that the world
[1:07:50] has ever known of no matter how much the
[1:07:53] word of God promised for this day is
[1:07:55] preached vindicate it they still won't
[1:07:57] believe
[1:07:58] it they won't believe
[1:08:01] it now how is not believing your message
[1:08:06] for this
[1:08:08] hour part of worshiping the devil let's
[1:08:13] get a scriptures I want to go to a
[1:08:15] scripture let me see if I can stay with
[1:08:18] my with the plan
[1:08:23] here I believe it's in
[1:08:26] Matthew or is it St
[1:08:29] John yeah St John 3 St John
[1:08:34] 8 let's look at now if people are just
[1:08:38] worshiping the god of
[1:08:41] History if you just worship the god of
[1:08:44] History you're worshiping the
[1:08:51] devil pretty
[1:08:54] strong because if you don't re worship
[1:08:57] the god of the I am right in front of
[1:09:02] you how we could bring in how many knows
[1:09:05] the
[1:09:06] indictment didn't brother baham says I
[1:09:09] indict this not not just worshiping
[1:09:11] devil now but actually he indicted this
[1:09:14] bunch of group bunch of clergy this
[1:09:16] generation the church and the ministers
[1:09:18] and all of them for the second
[1:09:22] crucifix is that right shpping the devil
[1:09:25] and crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:09:28] mean know that's exactly what the
[1:09:30] scribes and Pharisees did they worshiped
[1:09:32] their Creeds and their dogmas and would
[1:09:35] not take the manifested Jesus in front
[1:09:37] of them and he said if you don't believe
[1:09:39] that I am he you will die sins he said
[1:09:43] there's a day that if I wouldn't have
[1:09:44] showed you and what I have showed you
[1:09:46] your sin would have been covered but now
[1:09:48] you see now you're no longer innocent
[1:09:58] they answered him verse 33 we be
[1:10:00] Abraham's seed and were never in bondage
[1:10:03] to any man how sayest thou ye shall be
[1:10:06] made free down in verse chap verse 38 of
[1:10:08] chapter 8 I speak that which I have seen
[1:10:11] with my father and ye do that which you
[1:10:12] have seen with your father then answered
[1:10:16] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[1:10:18] is our
[1:10:19] father
[1:10:21] see claiming to be the children of
[1:10:23] Abraham and let no doubt but could point
[1:10:27] to it in their genetics and lineage
[1:10:29] ain't that
[1:10:31] right and Jesus answered said and they
[1:10:35] answered and said unto him Abraham is
[1:10:36] our father Jesus sath unto them if ye
[1:10:39] were Abraham's children you would do the
[1:10:41] works of
[1:10:43] Abraham but now you seek to kill me a
[1:10:45] man that has told you the truth which I
[1:10:47] have heard of God this did not
[1:10:50] Abraham ye do the Deeds of your
[1:10:54] father
[1:10:56] amen he says then said they unto him we
[1:10:59] be not born of fornication we have one
[1:11:01] father even
[1:11:03] God I mean know they claimed that God
[1:11:05] was their God just like today people say
[1:11:08] well I believe God I believe Jesus I
[1:11:10] believe what he
[1:11:11] did my whole sermon up there this
[1:11:13] weekend was you know people believe that
[1:11:15] Jesus died people say they believe but
[1:11:17] what does it mean to say that you
[1:11:19] believe amen if you really believe
[1:11:21] you'll believe what he did you'll
[1:11:23] believe that he paid for your sins amen
[1:11:25] and that you need have your sins
[1:11:27] remitted amen and you'll get the
[1:11:29] benefits of the remission of sins amen
[1:11:31] and your baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:33] because God wants to remit your sin amen
[1:11:35] and he wants to fill you with the
[1:11:36] baptism the Holy Ghost which is God
[1:11:39] himself amen if you don't get the
[1:11:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost you never
[1:11:43] believe the way that you ought to
[1:11:48] believe God comes down and you become
[1:11:50] the temple of God you become a
[1:11:53] representative of God your actions
[1:11:56] become the works that I do shall you do
[1:11:59] also if that if ain't that and you're
[1:12:02] just a mental believer of fictitional
[1:12:04] God Amen and what we got today is
[1:12:07] brother B said it he said another
[1:12:09] another thing is you know that they'll
[1:12:10] be hey highminded lovers of pleasure
[1:12:12] more than lovers of God amen truth
[1:12:14] Breakers and everything having the form
[1:12:16] of God in us amen they'll be Church
[1:12:18] guards but they'll deny the power
[1:12:20] that'll bring them to a
[1:12:22] change devil worshippers
[1:12:25] that believe in Jesus but they deny the
[1:12:27] power there of devil
[1:12:30] worshippers they want to stay like they
[1:12:34] are don't want to
[1:12:36] change don't want to be holy want to
[1:12:38] dress how do however they are want
[1:12:42] amen devil
[1:12:47] workers amen started out up there with
[1:12:50] you know unless you take up your cross
[1:12:52] and follow
[1:12:53] him ain't that right
[1:12:55] you're not worthy of it in other words
[1:12:57] that's dying to yourself that's dying to
[1:12:59] that old nature people want to keep that
[1:13:02] old
[1:13:03] nature all of that and still profess
[1:13:06] Christianity you're
[1:13:10] deceived amen all right praise the
[1:13:15] Lord so where we
[1:13:18] at if God were your father you would
[1:13:21] love
[1:13:21] me
[1:13:23] amen if God is your father you'll love
[1:13:26] what God does in your
[1:13:28] day let me say something else just comes
[1:13:31] to mind so I might as well but you know
[1:13:32] the other thing about the message of
[1:13:34] this hour is Amen in the Old Testament
[1:13:36] remember God says you know this uh you I
[1:13:39] want you to tell what happened here to
[1:13:40] your children let them tell their
[1:13:42] children amen David says I want to
[1:13:44] always have be telling and testifying of
[1:13:47] the testimonies of God Amen and she we
[1:13:50] should never be ashamed of testifying of
[1:13:52] the testimony of Jesus Christ and what
[1:13:54] he did in our day as a matter of fact
[1:13:56] we're supposed to tell our children
[1:13:58] they're supposed to tell T children to n
[1:14:00] down how many believe that that's right
[1:14:04] see it's all the testimonies of God in
[1:14:07] this hour doesn't matter what it is I
[1:14:09] love the I love the stories of the of
[1:14:12] what God has done in this hour and of
[1:14:14] what God is doing in my life and your
[1:14:16] life isn't that
[1:14:19] right
[1:14:22] amen I proceeded forth from God and I
[1:14:26] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[1:14:28] why do you not understand my speech even
[1:14:30] because you cannot hear my
[1:14:32] word woo think about it now these people
[1:14:35] were worshippers they sang song
[1:14:38] everything the way that God had said
[1:14:41] they made sacrifices and everything else
[1:14:43] but they had absolutely been blinded by
[1:14:46] their Creeds and their dogmas and their
[1:14:49] man-made
[1:14:53] ideas can and I say what it comes to my
[1:14:56] mind what about people that add to this
[1:15:00] message want to have a message the way
[1:15:02] did you want to have a message want to
[1:15:04] have a church the way you want to have a
[1:15:05] a church worshiping the devil and don't
[1:15:08] realize it it has to be God's way how
[1:15:11] many how many knows you can't misplace
[1:15:13] this word it has to be in God's will it
[1:15:16] has to be God's will he has to go be
[1:15:18] God's purpose otherwise you're off very
[1:15:21] easy amen takes a lot of prayer
[1:15:25] now notice he says look we can't hear my
[1:15:28] word you are of your father the devil
[1:15:32] even they said you snakes you serpents
[1:15:34] you generation vipers how can you escape
[1:15:37] the damn nation of Hell talking about a
[1:15:39] religious priest preachers and church
[1:15:44] let me ask you who were they
[1:15:46] worshiping oh God we love you we love
[1:15:49] you love you people say oh Jesus we love
[1:15:51] you and love you and love you and
[1:15:52] they're worshiping the devil
[1:15:56] is that a little hard for it to get to
[1:15:57] our head but it's the truth why because
[1:16:01] in their hearts remember Jesus says
[1:16:03] these people honor me with their lips
[1:16:06] they worship me with their lips and with
[1:16:07] their tongue but their heart is far from
[1:16:11] me it's somewhere else they love the
[1:16:15] uppermost seats they had all these
[1:16:17] things they wanted to kill
[1:16:19] Jesus amen they were so blinded with
[1:16:22] their man-made things woo come on let me
[1:16:26] let me read you some more brother Bram
[1:16:27] says
[1:16:29] it look when Jesus
[1:16:32] came let me
[1:16:35] see yeah that's as much of that as I
[1:16:38] want to read he that is of God heareth
[1:16:39] God's word ye therefore hear them not
[1:16:42] because you are not of God that's pretty
[1:16:44] good isn't it applies for our day look
[1:16:46] when Jesus came Satan was in that bunch
[1:16:49] of Jewish
[1:16:50] teachers and rabbis and Priests trying
[1:16:54] to tell them to keep the law of
[1:16:57] Moses when the very law said in that day
[1:17:01] that the son of man would be reveals he
[1:17:03] that he would reveal himself so they was
[1:17:06] trying as long as they kept them
[1:17:08] religious them Devils kept them
[1:17:09] religious and on the law on
[1:17:12] Moses see what he did he was trying to
[1:17:15] tell them that part of the word is just
[1:17:17] exactly right but this man isn't that
[1:17:20] person is what the devil was telling
[1:17:21] them this man's not that person n he's

[1:17:51] Pentecostal hang on to that evidence of
[1:17:54] speaking into tongues is you know when

[1:20:02] establish his own
[1:20:06] kingdom now we're going to kind of start

[1:20:21] have the word of God rule over them they
[1:20:24] accepted a murderer a barabus what this
[1:20:28] did what did this do it exalted Satan
[1:20:32] the God of this evil age to the place
[1:20:34] that he always wanted to
[1:20:37] be when you any individual in a church
[1:20:41] or a church preacher whoever it might be
[1:20:45] when you reject the word of God ain't
[1:20:47] that right the Living Word of God
[1:20:54] will not have that to rule over
[1:20:57] you how many knows there's two two ways

[1:21:02] something or you can oppose

[1:21:31] always want now listen for Satan is not
[1:21:33] spoke of as a god of any other age but
[1:21:36] this age he wasn't spoken of the god of
[1:21:38] Noah the age of Noah not the god of
[1:21:42] Moses the age of Moses or the age of
[1:21:44] Elijah but this evil age don't miss it
[1:21:48] he is the God of this evil age worshiped
[1:21:53] by millions and billions of
[1:21:57] people
[1:21:59] ignorantly they don't know
[1:22:05] it brother Glenn those are not my
[1:22:09] words all those churches that rejected
[1:22:12] Jesus Christ are worshiping the devil
[1:22:14] and that's why he was saying millions
[1:22:17] and billions of
[1:22:19] people now I believe there's people in
[1:22:22] there I I TR feel God's people in there
[1:22:25] that can come out but they need to
[1:22:28] stream
[1:22:29] tonight they need to stream services
[1:22:31] like this make them realize that if your
[1:22:33] church doesn't have a standard doesn't
[1:22:35] go by the Bible women cut their hair
[1:22:38] they do all the things that they want to
[1:22:39] do and everything and your preacher says
[1:22:41] it's okay it's time for you to Boogie on
[1:22:43] out of
[1:22:46] there that's
[1:22:48] right because it's been pronounced by
[1:22:50] God's Prophet that they're dead and that
[1:22:52] they're worshiping the devil
[1:22:55] singing Amazing Grace how sweet the
[1:22:57] sound that saved the WR like me and yet
[1:23:00] worshiping the devil because their lips
[1:23:01] may be honoring him but their heart is
[1:23:04] far from
[1:23:06] him
[1:23:08] amen my thank you Caleb you got another
[1:23:11] Amen Corner over
[1:23:13] here amen Satan is not spoke of all
[1:23:16] right millions and billions of people
[1:23:18] and they don't know it is that right
[1:23:21] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[1:23:24] and don't know it he said that's the
[1:23:26] crazy part is he don't know
[1:23:30] it
[1:23:33] amen but let's let the scripture uncover
[1:23:36] him next it was Satan's ambition to be
[1:23:38] worshiped like God he took two thirds of
[1:23:40] the angels and stars of Heaven ascended
[1:23:42] up and so forth preached to them ain't
[1:23:44] that right now he is ready with his
[1:23:47] selected educated bride by his own
[1:23:50] knowledge see all painted up in deceit
[1:23:53] of big buildings and big
[1:23:55] denominations how many know these mega
[1:24:00] churches how many like to be a part of a
[1:24:02] mega
[1:24:04] church
[1:24:06] amen I wouldn't
[1:24:09] either that's right I was in one I went
[1:24:12] this
[1:24:13] weekend our service was at 2
[1:24:17] o'clock and uh so that people that go to
[1:24:19] mega churches or whatever whoever
[1:24:21] wanteded to come they could so I went
[1:24:23] with my cousin David
[1:24:25] and they may be listening tonight
[1:24:27] hopefully they are God bless you if you
[1:24:29] are but listen I went to that
[1:24:31] church and went in there and the
[1:24:34] pre-service
[1:24:36] music was this hard rock
[1:24:40] stuff Christian Christian
[1:24:45] rock F I'm sorry that's it it's all you
[1:24:50] have to be Christian rock that gives it
[1:24:52] away wasn't quiet music like what we
[1:24:55] have know our churches listen to this
[1:24:58] they had a big screen up front nothing
[1:24:59] wrong with a big screen we like to have
[1:25:01] a big screen everything else isn't that
[1:25:05] right now going into broad is the way is
[1:25:11] that right the way that the majority of
[1:25:13] the people are going is not the way that
[1:25:16] you want to be
[1:25:17] going no cuz it's just going to be a few
[1:25:21] Jesus said narrow is the way that leadth
[1:25:24] to
[1:25:25] life people don't want people coming out
[1:25:28] of the Amish they want they don't want
[1:25:30] laws they don't want rules they simply
[1:25:32] amen they want all
[1:25:34] Grace
[1:25:36] huh and I understand 90% of the mega
[1:25:39] church right there was was ex Amish a
[1:25:42] lot of EX Amish even the preacher said
[1:25:44] here's a new family come from the
[1:25:45] Schwarz and trober
[1:25:47] Amish they looked a little Amish in
[1:25:49] their uh genetics and so forth but you
[1:25:51] couldn't tell people went all the way
[1:25:54] from but you got to realize something
[1:25:56] that Jesus said that unless your
[1:25:58] righteousness
[1:26:00] is exceeds that of the
[1:26:03] Pharisees how many know they had some
[1:26:05] lot of rules and strict stuff ain't that
[1:26:09] right he says unless your righteousness
[1:26:11] exceeds theirs I want to say this that
[1:26:14] being a
[1:26:16] Christian I hope they're listening being
[1:26:18] a Christian is a lot stricter than being
[1:26:22] Amish
[1:26:31] David was telling me that I and We Know
[1:26:33] It that little boy Bo young boys from 14
[1:26:36] to about 20 they let him go drink and go
[1:26:39] to bars and get drunk and just all kinds
[1:26:41] of crazy stuff they Don't Preach against
[1:26:44] it they let them have their Wild Oats
[1:26:46] and then about about 19 20 years how
[1:26:49] many times straighten up join Church
[1:26:51] getting married and and stop all that
[1:26:54] amen of course you know they have bed
[1:26:55] courtships you know for dating and
[1:26:57] everything else that's totally
[1:26:59] unrighteous and
[1:27:01] Unholy but as long as you belong to them
[1:27:03] you can go about get away with stuff as
[1:27:06] long as you repent at the next uh get
[1:27:08] together or their next communion you
[1:27:10] know make it right hey as long as you're
[1:27:12] with them they just let you about do
[1:27:14] anything ain't that the way churches
[1:27:17] are but I feel for the people hello
[1:27:25] amen tell you something of course you
[1:27:27] know they had good gospel music there
[1:27:29] they had a
[1:27:30] band good good uh
[1:27:36] songs I've got a picture here you know
[1:27:40] kind of videoed everything and I got a
[1:27:42] picture of a guy standing there in
[1:27:45] shorts worshiping God and drinking
[1:27:48] coffee right in the congregation
[1:27:49] everybody you know can have
[1:27:52] coffee are you drinking you know you got
[1:27:56] to we got to realize something that all
[1:27:58] those stuff that goes on it's inspired
[1:28:00] by something the preachers not wearing
[1:28:03] the halfway you know coming in raggedy
[1:28:05] clothes and everybody else just wearing
[1:28:07] casual and being casual they have a
[1:28:10] casual religion the way they talks C
[1:28:12] everything's
[1:28:13] casual I didn't hear one amen I didn't
[1:28:16] hear one Hallelujah from the
[1:28:18] congregation amen and let me tell you
[1:28:20] something we come to the house of God to
[1:28:22] worship our music and everything else
[1:28:24] shouldn't be our worship that is what
[1:28:27] helps you helps me to worship God say
[1:28:30] hallelujah praise the
[1:28:33] Lord
[1:28:35] amen let me go on listen big buildings
[1:28:40] denominations paints theology smart Ed
[1:28:44] intellectual educated and deceive the
[1:28:47] whole world and become a God that's what
[1:28:49] he's done all heading up into person of
[1:28:51] the Antichrist which is already found
[1:28:54] viker of God by his worldly loving
[1:28:56] scientific all dressed up and PP and
[1:28:59] artificial and religion education see
[1:29:02] has made religious like him people are
[1:29:06] religious I I want to say this that I
[1:29:09] don't see how you can be worshiping God
[1:29:10] outside of the new
[1:29:14] birth
[1:29:15] huh nobody can even call Jesus to Christ
[1:29:18] but by the Holy
[1:29:21] Ghost amen listen to this
[1:29:25] oh my let me go to the next one notice
[1:29:27] they the people exalt him above all
[1:29:30] that's called
[1:29:32] God don't second Thessalonians so that
[1:29:35] he say that he would do it the authority
[1:29:39] and the authority of a denominational
[1:29:41] Church the people believing that
[1:29:43] denomination more than they believe God
[1:29:47] and God is the word they'll believe
[1:29:49] their denominational Creed above the
[1:29:51] word which exalts him above of all
[1:29:54] that's called
[1:29:55] God in the beginning was the word the
[1:29:58] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:30:01] if God isn't first in your life hello
[1:30:06] then the devil is first in your life
[1:30:08] brother bam says you say the Americans
[1:30:10] aren't a bunch of idol worshippers you
[1:30:14] he said Americans are a bunch of idol
[1:30:16] worshippers and that you put before God
[1:30:20] is a idol you're worshiping the devil
[1:30:26] that's got a thing but it's truth God
[1:30:28] help us never to let anything come in
[1:30:31] front of God because that's exactly what
[1:30:34] the devil wants it could be your job it
[1:30:36] could be your your wife it could be
[1:30:39] anything it's more important to you than
[1:30:42] God you put it higher than God it exalts
[1:30:45] the devil over
[1:30:47] God pretty strong
[1:30:50] tonight oh they'll believe their
[1:30:52] denominational Creed about of the word
[1:30:54] now notice there's only one God and
[1:30:57] that's the word all that's called God so
[1:31:00] he as God sits in the Church of God
[1:31:02] proving that he is God because he's got
[1:31:05] the people worshiping
[1:31:08] him well it doesn't matter how I dress
[1:31:11] he's got you worshiping
[1:31:13] him it doesn't matter how I live I can
[1:31:16] drink a little I can smoke a little I
[1:31:18] can do this that or the other you're
[1:31:19] worshiping the devil thinking you're
[1:31:22] worshiping God
[1:31:25] he exalts himself above all that's
[1:31:27] called God there's only one God and that
[1:31:29] is the word see all that's called God is
[1:31:32] God is the God of this age has exalted
[1:31:34] himself above the true Vindicated word
[1:31:36] of God that's St John all that's above
[1:31:40] all that's called God so that he set
[1:31:42] sets in the temple of God showing
[1:31:44] himself that he is god with authority
[1:31:47] amen
[1:31:49] listen now let's watch it be manifested
[1:31:52] he says that he's making a better world
[1:31:54] for them to live in by his knowledge
[1:31:56] apart from the never failing word of God
[1:31:59] but by his coming together in
[1:32:00] denomination and Creeds and intellectual
[1:32:03] scientific and so forth he's making a
[1:32:05] better world for man to live in and
[1:32:07] ignoring the promise of God that the
[1:32:09] only time the world will ever be fit in
[1:32:11] to live in is know to my opinion he
[1:32:14] making a better world for people to sin
[1:32:16] in instead of living isn't that exactly

[1:38:26] home it's right next to it right next to
[1:38:31] it that's why I'm not too interested in
[1:38:33] being lit up too much or having all the
[1:38:35] song and listen we were singing oh uh um
[1:38:39] what was it we
[1:38:40] exalt thee we exalt thee we exalt thee
[1:38:47] Oh Lord isin that right and I thought
[1:38:49] well good praise the Lord here we are
[1:38:50] exalting the Lord but I find that these
[1:38:53] new songs that they come out with I got
[1:38:56] real concerned with them because they
[1:38:58] don't mention Jesus or the crucifixion
[1:39:00] or the cross okay so which Lord are you
[1:39:04] exalting
[1:39:05] here oh Lord God you're our God yeah
[1:39:08] there's a lot of songs that can be
[1:39:10] applied to the devil I like songs that
[1:39:13] it's very clear that you're worshiping
[1:39:15] Jesus
[1:39:17] [Applause]
[1:39:24] amen and be in the atmosphere that was
[1:39:26] there the rock and roll hard for me to
[1:39:29] see I'm say man who are we worship him
[1:39:31] up in
[1:39:34] here cuz when I sing we exalt thee I
[1:39:36] know who I'm talking to but all the
[1:39:39] deceived people are going to sing that
[1:39:41] thinking they're worshiping Jesus when
[1:39:44] worshiping the devil anything contrary
[1:39:46] to the word you're worshiping the devil
[1:39:54] gloves off
[1:39:55] right that's the truth though I thought
[1:40:03] my made me leery of lights made me Leary
[1:40:06] of big screens Brother Brad remember the
[1:40:09] smoke if we had smoke coming up and
[1:40:11] entertainment you could have a
[1:40:14] crowd why Levi he barely had a musician
[1:40:16] he didn't have hardly anybody we didn't
[1:40:18] have hardly anything that church
[1:40:21] blossomed I thought all he'd have to do
[1:40:23] is do do what they do and I guarantee
[1:40:24] you half of them will come over to
[1:40:27] him but who wants all that 90% of it was
[1:40:33] entertainment 15% was word a little bit
[1:40:36] of preaching and so forth but most of it
[1:40:38] was entertainment a quir crowd you
[1:40:40] couldn't hear Sing at
[1:40:42] all everybody stood there and watched
[1:40:44] entertainment
[1:40:46] Hollywood that's how it is all probably
[1:40:48] all mega churches hello we don't want
[1:40:51] Hollywood
[1:40:53] and the
[1:40:55] atmosphere like I said the way that
[1:40:57] people dress coming in there whatever
[1:41:01] it's
[1:41:02] casual how many of knows brother baham
[1:41:04] says that when you come to the house of
[1:41:05] God don't bring your drinks and
[1:41:07] everything else and chewing gum people
[1:41:09] was chewing chewing gum standing there
[1:41:11] drinking drinks others are arm folded
[1:41:13] you know looking
[1:41:15] around coming in casual why do I wear a
[1:41:18] tie why do I dress up why don't I just
[1:41:21] wear well I get kicked out have had
[1:41:24] pants with holes in it and stuff like
[1:41:25] some of them
[1:41:27] do but it represents lukewarmness
[1:41:30] Brother Brad I truly felt that he was
[1:41:33] represented lukewarmness just a casual
[1:41:38] religion I don't want no casual religion
[1:41:42] when I come to the house of God I want
[1:41:43] the preach to have the preacher preach
[1:41:46] hell fire and
[1:41:48] brimstone I want him to preach amen
