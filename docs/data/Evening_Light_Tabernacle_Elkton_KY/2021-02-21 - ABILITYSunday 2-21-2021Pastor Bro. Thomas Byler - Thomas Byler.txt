[Music] so [Music] you [Music] morning brothers and sisters if uh before we if you go ahead and stand with me please go ahead and be before we open in prayer go ahead and turn to ecclesiastes the seventh chapter i hope god's been good to you all this week that his blessings are abiding with you and i'll just open with the word of prayer whatever you have in need of this morning you know don't be afraid to ask for it don't be afraid to believe it whatever you need this morning god is more than able to meet your needs this morning we know that we want god to speak to us today through this service we don't want to go away empty we want to go away full so i'll just pray lord god we just come to your house lord with our hearts open lord with the desire to see you minister to the needs of your people lord that you speak to our hearts again of your word and your desire for us in this age that we live lord i pray that you'll bless your people each one hear the lord you know their needs

this service lord take full control over it lord his art is my prayer we just believe these things lord in your precious name amen and i'll start with the first verse here you know i i'm not gonna go but just remember that the word of god is a powerful thing as we speak it you know it might not hit your heart but you never know it might hate someone else's heart might be the thing they need to hear this morning to make them victorious in the days ahead and i'll start with this first verse a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the continents the heart is made better it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroy of the be heart hasty in thy spirit to be angry and angry for anger rested in the bosom of fools wisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there is profit to them that see the son for wisdom is defense and money is defense but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it amen i said the most important thing is the word of god has to abide in our hearts brother david sing that little course so glad i'm yours this morning so glad i'm yours lord so glad your mercy has followed me you found me and you set me free so glad i'm your soul so glad amen once again if we cut this morning so glad i'm your joy so glad i'm yours so glad you're mercy [Music] [Applause] [Music] and you set me free so glad i'm yours so glad i'm yours amen

young i got so much rest i mean running around the time or take a man praise the lord but anyway so yep that's something else but i just thank god i guess the scariest part uh of it all uh was when sister donna called me about brother al in the hospital she called me and you know those phone calls as a pastor they scare you to death because i knew he was in the hospital with double pneumonia and you know i was like oh don't don't don't you tell me you know but she said somebody needs to pick him up i was like you know that's what i want to hear you know he's ready to leave the hospital you

thankful that large brought us through it amen and it looks like it's hopefully over with by the god amen and so we'll he may continue our wednesday night services from now on all right i didn't want to shut the wednesday nights down but with what we went through i felt like it was the best thing to do amen i certainly just wanted to stay at the house for a couple days and so but we're doing much better by the grace of god and i know that everybody as far as i know is and so we should just be thankful amen and i know hey you know maybe you got covered at church huh hey i would rather get it at church than anywhere else that's right if i'm gonna get cold i'm gonna get covered at church you know because i like to have church you know if it kills me i don't care i want to go to church you know we ain't gonna quit going to church right that's right so praise the lord and god knows and he's easy things he knows everything we're going through he's not ignorant of anything so praise be to god amen so praise the lord amen god is good thank you again brother john amen he went through a lot of trouble amen to make sure we could come and get together to numb this morning and praise the lord and worship him amen and so we got to make it worthwhile amen ain't going to take no pay so but we're just gonna give god the glory amen and really give the lord our best this morning and we appreciate each and every one of you that made it out hopefully all of your roads were clear amen and so amen we thought we could probably squeeze it in this morning and then to have service because i hate not to have it but um and the last thing was to get that cleared him in the parking lot because it was in pretty bad shape we got that done so we're very thankful amen for that amen so wednesday nights we will continue on now amen and have services regular once again amen praising god for his goodness amen so i can't think of any other announcements amen praise the lord amen let's stand this morning if you will we'll just go into the sincerity part of the service now and and see what the lord will have for us the lord laid a message on my heart about i don't know four or five days ago and so we've been seeking the lord to be able to speak through us this morning that would be a blessing to your heart and to your soul so god bless you just good to see everybody this morning amen and good to see everybody out and feeling better and amen just to be together amen we're together again just praising the lord let's bow our heads before we open the word heavenly father we come before you this morning lord jesus and we just want to thank you from the bottom of our heart lord that we can once again feel good lord jesus and lord we realize lord jesus there's different kinds of sicknesses that we catch and i know this has been a little bit different what we're used to by a long shot but father lord whether it's uh just a regular influenza or flu whatever it might be lord or whether it's the covet we know that thou art our healer and father we are here to this morning giving you honor and glory lord that we're better that we feel good father lord we want to always honor you with our life the way that we live every breath that we have every word that we would speak every affection every emotion that we would have lord we want to just glorify your name this morning and father we just pray lord jesus that you'll take the thought that i feel lord you've laid upon my heart to speak lord and just say what you once said to strengthen your people and may your holy spirit come down in a special way father for we realize that it's you know what makes all the difference is when you come so we invite you to come this morning may every heart be opened every mind and every channel opened father so that you could come down and saturate our hearts our hearts and our lives lord in a special way that we would go from here lord haven't been able to say lord did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way lord and as we were in his presence and as we come to church lord to bask in your presence lord jesus the holy spirit may the holy spirit special way lord and just do what you always do do exceedingly abundant above all that we could ask or think this morning lord and father for all those that are still at home lord for whatever reason we ask your blessing to rest upon them father keep us all safe from all harm lord and we know that our lives are safe and secure in your arms lord jesus no matter what would happen we don't have to worry about it because you are taking care of it all we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen maybe before i read the word there is one more that just came to mind i don't know if brother david or and probably everybody knows you know but about the uh two bulls did we mention anything better steve or david okay yeah we have two bulls that's been donated to the church and we had it butchered and it's down in the fellowship hall freezer so anybody that wants to have some meat to eat praise the lord we've got some good steak for you and lots of hamburger amen so amen just get with one of the deacons and we'll get you a box or whatever amen so that you can get some meat to eat amen praise the lord and may god bless those people that have done that amen now turn if you will to your bibles to the book of num the book of numbers and would it be okay if we take our time this morning amen we'll just take our time this morning because we just want to say what god wants us to say amen and i trust that it will be a blessing to you certainly i appreciate it brother brad's message last sunday i really like that that was really good amen praise god amen and this morning i want to talk to you on the subject of ability ability amen in numbers the 13th chapter and we'll begin with verse 26 and they went and came to getting ahead of you there a little bit chapter 13 verse 26 and they came and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness param to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we we came into the land wither doubt did send us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit thereof nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of enoch there and the amalekites dwelt in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwelled by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stealed the people before moses said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the man that went with up uh with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched on the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there were and there we saw the giants the sons of enoch which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight and all of the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and all the people of the congregation said unto them would to god that we had died in the land of egypt or with the god that we had died in this wilderness and wherefore saith the lord hath the lord brought us into this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children shall be pray were with not better that we should return to egypt amen amen and that's as far as we will go god bless the reading of the words you can be seated this morning so we see here there was two thoughts isn't that right two ideas one of them was when caleb began to hear all this he heard a lot of negative thoughts a lot of negative words am i right they're stronger than we are these guys are giants they're huge people and they're inhabited everywhere everywhere you go by the seaside or whether you go to the south or whether he go to the north i mean these people are strong they're very armed they're very capable you know and he says we be not able so we want to take the thought of ability for a while amen because ability now we would if when we begin to think about ability it's the uh it's something that helps you to be able to actually get something done amen there's ability and then there's inability unable not able can't do it the difference between able to do it or you can't do it you're either able to do it or you're not able to do it amen so that's what we want to focus on this morning with the help of the lord and so we see this that especially here that when caleb saw it he said look let us go up at once let's go right away let's go do this he said we can do it we can do it we're able we're well able to do it more than able all right we're more than able to do this the other said we're not we can't you can't do it we can't do it nope can't do it and uh as we know the majority of them took the side of we can't do it now if i'm not wrong brother branham said that this was where israel made their last fatal decision that was the last time that god dealt with these guys right that was the last time that he was going to deliver them out of the hands of the enemy and and do a miracle for them and and so forth and then them for them to see the land it meant to be negative to such a point they had already come god had already brought him out of egypt he already supplied them food when they were hungry he already had the rock to bring water out he already fed a manna from heaven and opened the red sea and just i think it was either these 10 times the bible talks about these 10 times have i showed my power huh have i showed my ability to deliver them isn't that right amen and this was the last time this was the last time amen that they were going to disbelieve god isn't that right because the bible says over hebrew said he says they would not enter into israel because of what unbelief that's actually what kept them out of the promised land was their unbelief they never could get it through their heads hey you know look at the picture picture you're more than able to do it praise be to god amen so in this scenario here we want to take several scenarios here with the help of the lord we want to talk about daniel for a little bit also but you know in this scenario here god was basically fed up he was it was done let me tell you something uh even even when uh the pharisees and the children of israel whenever jesus was talking to them and they were talking about moses being their prophet and abraham is our father and so forth and our fathers eight will a man in the wilderness and when they were saying that the jesus if you remember jesus says and they are everyone dead our prophet taught us that what that meant was eternally separated from god is that right dead not sleeping or whatever but they were dead they were all dead amen that they were lost amen and we know that out of two million people there was only two people in that right out of that original bunch that made it into the promised land now we know that their children because after this god told them to go back out into the wilderness go back you know for 40 years they wondered hello they wandered until that old generation the old fighters the old doubters the old unbelievers all died off god says i'll take your children in your children go in because you say hey here we are gonna perish our children are gonna perish you know he says i'm gonna take your children but you're not gonna go in so joshua and caleb went in with their children and they were crossed over into the promised land but every one of them perished because they did not believe that they had the ability to do it with god i don't know about you but at whatever it is that you do you either can do it or you cannot do it and that right is one or the other and if you can do it there's that ability or the equipment and then to be able to get the job done we all know that half of any kind of a job is having the right equipment to do it praise be to god and you know there was a time there was a time all the way up until acts 2 38 all the way until there was a time when man amen it was very hard for them to overcome sin overcome unbelief overcome the lusts of the flesh is that right because they didn't have the means to be able to do it they would come and they make sacrifices to god and kill the sheep and the lambs and so forth every year but they would still go out there with the same desire that they had before they'd have to come the next year maybe maybe around december or whatever what time every day would come amen they would have done the same thing again they did the year before they they absolutely did not have the ability to overcome amen praise the lord all right let me uh read you a quote from the prophet now amen amen it's what was the holy ghost given for and he talks about moses when moses was called by god he says he was a total complete prophet and here's the segment i want you to listen to when god sends a man to do anything he completely equips him with everything that he has needed praise be to god y'all see your seat don't get too happy now but think about it if god ever sends a man if he gets you to do something he's not going to send you half ready half equipment he's going to give you everything that you have needed to get the job done praise be to god aren't you happy for that this morning in other words she's gonna make you able amen not unable he didn't bring them up here to kadesh barnea and to make them believe they can't do it that was not what god had intended whatsoever it so displeased god until basically they cross the line between mercy and judgment when you cross that line you can never go back again it's like blasphemy the holy ghost it's over with god's son hello amen so i like that notice he equips him completely equips him with everything that he has need of and if god calls a man to be a preacher he puts something in him to preach with amen if he calls him to be a teacher he put something in him to teach with amen if he calls him to be a prophet he'll pull something in him to be able to see visions amen how many knows that brother branham even explained to us that when god builds a prophet amen he puts his conscience and his subconscious so close together that he can actually see a dream while he's wide awake well i call it a dream but it's actually a vision because how many of us will have a dream and we'll remember just very vividly what it is i had one the other day very vivid dream amen of the house and uh just everything i ain't going to get into that but anyway and i can tell you the full details of it all but the prophet even he is he brings it so close together that he gives him that ability not everybody has that ability but he equips him praise be to god and i got to thinking about that that doesn't apply just to a prophet or a teacher i believe that applies to every one of us if he calls you to be a son or a daughter of god he will equip with you with the power to be able to be a son and daughter of god one of the things i want to bring out to this morning it's going to be one of the punch lines of the whole message of what i felt like the holy spirit brought to my attention and i want to bring to us the reason why we are not able the reason why that we are not able to do it amen how many like to know why i can't do this why why can't i do this in other words whatever it is that you need to overcome or whatever you need because in ephesians 3 ephesians 3 and well let's just begin with uh verse 20. now unto him that is able huh to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us how many knows that god is able oh my the whole story this morning is you're not able and if there's any of you there it's not going to be able if there's any of you still in you you're not going to be able but if it's him that's right if it's him you're more than able that's the way joshua and caleb was i absolutely without a question they'll believe with all of my heart that that's the kind of people that's going to be preaching maybe one day maybe in a few maybe just a man preaching and having a church service amen and time is by the hope just walk from this dimension into another my body just changes not vanish because god is able i believe it huh it'll be people that know that it is more than able god is able amen praise be to god to do exceedingly he is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think didn't jesus say one place he said that with you nothing shall be impossible them big heavy fat juicy words nothing shall be impossible to him that believes with him that believes all things things are possible don't talk to me about i can't do it huh go back and listen to that tape what is the holy ghost given for when or a total deliverance total deliverance huh but brahm talks about he says don't make no excuses with this there's no excuses we try to make excuses well no i can't because don't give me god already give you the equipment that you need i may believe god has given you the equipment that you need to be a complete overcomer to be a complete christian amen he equips you with such when did he could do that on calvary amen i believe that the tool was given to us i believe the equipment was given to us when he said it is done it is finished i have supplied you with what you have need of i have paid the price i have purchased that now all you got to do is believe amen all you got to do is receive it let's see folks how many beliefs that this this this promised land that they were to go into oh it flows with milk and honey oh my can i just stop there for just a second maybe the rest of the day and talk about how sweet how great it is to taste the fruit of forgiveness to know that god has taken your guilt he has taken your shame he has taken all your sins of the past and he has blotted it out and you stand just before almighty god oh it's sweet huh and he gives you the baptism of the holy ghost now how many knows what the holy ghost is holy ghost is god's very own life that's why the holy ghost is so important in our hearts because if his life isn't in there you'll never know what the peace that passes understanding is all about it's just no way to explain it my if i hit that ceiling and bump my head i would it's just so awesome huh you just can't there's just no words to explain the peace of god or the joy unspeakable of glory this is little that it flows with fresh revelation it flows with milk and honey amen oh it's a beautiful land but you know what this land that you're going into that's got full of hittites and they're right jebusites parasites huh canaanites oh there's all kind of bites not only that but there's some really big ugly giants in the land huh that you gotta face that you gotta overcome that you're gonna have to fight you want this land you're gonna have to go in there and you're gonna have to break down walls that you can run chariots races around and think about this while i'm telling you all this all of these enemies is right here it's that guy you're sitting with yes oh there's some big walls that you gotta break through oh there's some giants in there that you gotta break through see taste feel here smell your imagination your reason oh i don't know if i can't quit that just let me tear that off let me just take that song and sling that thing down don't start a reason and tell me i can't do it huh some some giants is gonna have to be killed before you'll ever get to possess it before you'll ever enjoy the promised land you're gonna have to do some overcoming you're gonna have to take some walls down you're to have to see some giants fall amen and thirdly let me tell you something else i want to talk to you about with the help of the lord this morning for a while and that is that our christian walk with the lord it isn't over with when you get born again your fight with unbelief your fight with your flesh and lust temptation wrong thoughts wrong deeds even that isn't over with it's a growing process oh god saved abraham he says i have made the father of nations ah he believed god and it was imputed unto him he was saved but he still took lot with him he stood till his father with him he still had a lot of turmoil he still had a bigger and fuss and fighting on the backside of the dead he still took a lot of unbelief unbelievable process huh that's the way it is with our life oh we feel the sweetness of the holy ghost come down and forgive us of our sin we think oh it's going to be heaven from here on out hello first thing we know we go down into one of them he white valleys the jebusite seasides we get the blues and we wonder if we ever was saved am i really a son come on folks all this comes in and that comes in trials comes why does this still bother me god's working on us i believe he's working on us until the fullness of christ is in us because a baby has a pre-born it has to learn to walk it has to grow up into its teenage years it has to go up until it becomes a full stature of a man or a woman and that's the way it is with us it was with the way with abraham it was the way it was with israel but you know the problem with israel is the neighbor would grow grow huh because how many knows after the water turned into blood after they had fleas in the pharaohs on between his sheets little fleas jumping around and biting his legs and getting up in his armpits and biting it just get your people and get out of here huh i would too wouldn't you that's right he can make him so miserable god made him so miserable he said just take your people and go i had enough i mean all the children of israel but they did they had a church service like you wouldn't believe i'm 2 million strong i could hear the whole valley man it sounded like other people praising god amen they were talking wow we ain't slaves no more we're free we're free my neighbor even give me all his jewelry man they were so glad to see them go on they were so glad the was over tested thank god put it on the hearts of the egyptians and all them to give them a bunch of jewelry and everything else all of that stuff boy they were wow cloud nine huh that's what god puts us on oh cloud nine everything's so wonderful here we go we're all going midway back there over the hill and down through the valley and over through some rocks and hills and back down through and amen between two great big cliffs came down around the cliffs and down around the corner there goes moses leading them come on comes right down here and there's water everywhere down here wait wait we took a wrong turn folks moses there's a pillar fire so i'm following the filler fire there it sits right over the water yeah we get the funny face in our life how can this be how can this happen to me paul said i have learned whatever state i am to be happy to be contained very next verse that i wanted to read for he says for i have learned you know i can and i can do all things right after that he says i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me paul was a can doer i can't do [Music] friends be the god that's what we need more people and that's why we all need to be loved we can do it no we can't you can well i don't have no joy in my life anymore i don't think i'll ever get my joy back again huh i'll never have that sweetness i'll never have that joy that i once had i'm just an old mossback meme christian huh people been so mean to me i've had so many rough ways to go people back bite me people do me wrong bro no you ain't got to live there hello you ain't got to live there you don't have to live in a place where there's no joy amen the one thing i've heard here this last week was the part where amen brother branham said that the the eagle has the ability to become young again and if you're truly a son and daughter of god you might get all moth like you might get callous you don't even want to go to church anymore huh you don't hardly feed up tapes you don't listen to the bible you might get but yeah if it's in your genetics if you're truly ego just keep eating that food a little bit amen and i guarantee you you'll go through your moping period but you'll come out the other side stronger than ever hallelujah after what we went through i want you to know i hope this morning that we come back stronger than ever happier than ever don't let this cover get you down worse things are coming this ain't nothing huh my brother down in north carolina moe's i guess they posted something but there's some kind of a bill they're trying to pass through the laws and stuff and they're trying to make sure there's gonna be that the other we're gonna stop them from this them stopping from that my wife is pointing out i said honey you know the ship called the hope for america sailed in 1957 it's long gone and it's never coming back i don't care you know they put bills in there that's going to take your religious liberty away that's just fulfilling scripture they're supposed to do that you ought to be saying god hey praise the lord we're rounding this thing down finally huh that's right it's supposed to go that way well there's only one thing left for america and that is the fire of god to come and to burn it up it's the only hope for this world praise be to god for you and me and that's where that's where we get rough on politically huh if we get our eyes on that oh don't let this happen don't let that you're going for real disappointment it's supposed to happen it's supposed to get worse and we're seeing the multiplication of it isn't that right amen if you remember in daniel's time they manipulated the laws isn't that right to where it became illegal for him to worship his god that's what's happening around us they want to make it illegal for us to worship our god boy i'll tell you what you preach against homosexuality we'll shut you down go ahead and shut me down because i'ma preach against homosexuality against me against lesbianism against the government against everything that's ungodly that's my right as a prophet as a messenger of god boy i'll tell you what we do killed 68 million of us before you might want to try to do it again i don't know but one thing's for sure there's a higher authority than the laws of the land that's the law of god but then manipulate it to where it would get daniel in trouble isn't that right and he got daniel in trouble and got him phoned in the lines then what did the king say the next morning he liked daniel and he had hated that that had happened he went out there and what did he say daniel the god that you serve every day and all the time that's the problem sometimes is we don't serve god all the time like daniel did i believe he's got to be a constant serving of the lord jesus christ every day every minute a day every breath you breathe it needs to be the lord huh and the king said daniel was your god able to save you from the lion's mouth hallelujah then you said yeah king he is more than able how many know we serve a god that is able more than able to take care of any problems that you have just allow your needs to give you a revival in your heart to revive that to reach how many needs are reused returning of your youth just like you once loved the lord and served god with all your heart you got away from that perhaps hello can you hear the spirit speaking to you you've gotten away from me but you can come back you're able i made the means i supplied the means amen praise be god yes he's able amen just like tasha and the cable we're more than able to take it oh mine i want to tell you something whatever the laws of the land become whatever we face in our future how many knows our god is able not only is he able but you are able we're more than able to face whatever comes our way and if god ever called you to be a christian if he called you think about it i've always wondered what it would have been like to have been born in the middle ages back in the 1500s 1400s you know gladiators and swords and [Music] all this stuff but it was a catholic rule how many knows for a thousand years the catholics ruled and anybody disagreed with them went to the state got burnt went into the gladiators den hello fed the lions and all these other things gave their life for the gospel amen but i wasn't born back then you wasn't born back then why god has chosen you to live now and if he chose you to live now and he has called you in your heart to be a christian now i believe he's going to be equipping you to overcome this laodicea age this lay odyssey age oh my back then they didn't have hardly anything when i think about me 1920s when we had that stock market crashing everybody had to go out they made it take corn and feed it on the railroad tracks and eat that corn and they would oh people starving people one job people wouldn't work huh but yet that revival look at the revival that we had people come to god people pray now we've got everything the devil has given us every little delicacy everything ain't meant to take your time aiming to rob you of what god really has for you make you so busy with getting things and having things and having things nicer so you can't say amen in church you can't say hallelujah amen maybe oh my even brother bob says you know good times enable life of ease has never been good for the christian it makes him soft and doty a little bit of persecution that's always been good for the church hard times hard times will make you a lot better person than good times will oh yeah it's your will if what's most why do you think god allows trials to come your way i mean not another fifty thousand dollars not another hundred thousand dollars but trials things that make you sweat a little i mean that's what males character in you it's what make mole's character in us he could have made this world all a life of ease but he didn't make it that way all around his death all around his sickness all around his oh my it's just horrible amen but in the midst of all of this prosperity in the midst of all this getting and all of these goods that we have i believe the bride of jesus christ is going to keep her eye on the word of god amen we care about what we have here we care about whether we go to heaven even when there's holiness and righteousness and purity we care about how we're going to look when he comes whether we'll be accepted of him or not because that's what's important folks the coming of the lord amen praise the lord god is good amen this is another reason i really wanted to have this service this morning because i had something on my heart i'll tell everybody come lord give me a good message come on come on to church let's have church amen praise the lord it's not a rebuke not against anybody but amen i hope people was not sled riding yesterday but they can't make it to church today i think somebody needs to die a little folks we can do a lot of stuff on saturday but we can make it to the house of god come on folks where's your love at gotten a little bit of that layout to see it rubbing off on you amen lukewarmness amen praise be to god all right oh god is good isn't he oh so let's listen to this here we go all right let's go to part number two part number two on why why it is that so many times we can't all right then just like you says if you're a christian now god don't make halfway christians he makes complete christians god don't make any halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway folks how many knows that that's the truth so many christians are about half christian half the time a little bit kinda what makes you that way what makes it that way i don't make it that way amen let me stop for just a second if i can find it let's talk about the preacher first of all if he makes a preacher brother ben says you know if he makes a preacher he'll give you something to be able to preach with in he romans let me see if i've got this rope down here so i brought my pen along so i could hebrews one write these things down so i don't confuse myself hebrews 1 and 7. now notice verse seven and of the angel he saith who maketh his angels spirits as angels or messengers or ministers and he makes his ministers a flame of fire so if a preacher is called to preach he makes him a flame of fire and no wonder whoever wherever he come from way back i guess minister of many years ago that become that said this he says you know why did the people want to come and hear you why did they come out to hear you what oh he said they come out to hear me because i just what i do is i set myself on fire and the people watch me burn many things that's the word all the work that's the way that a christian is that's the way that every one of us that has the holy ghost amen he gives you a flame of fire a liquifier in your heart the people watch you burn and they say well i want what he's got i'll never never forget when i brought the message to moani and mose and my brother's up there that was the words that moani said he says you know i don't know just what you got but whatever it is you got i want it huh how many please that should be the testimony of every christian your neighbors your wife should be able to see christ in you i backed my truck down this morning my wife's back's much better but she's still you know a little bit hurting a little bit and so and but i backed my truck down and it was snowy and slick i always parked my truck down and wait for my wife to lock the house up bring her person everything out there i had told her to bring a cup of coffee with her you know and i was sitting there and i watched her trying to hold a cup of coffee lock the door and someone said you know a gentleman would get out and open the door for a helper i got myself out of that truck you know come over around that slick spot that says here let me have that coffin let me have him first open the door help her in and help that says honey holy spirit just told me a gentleman come out here and he said well she said well i am certainly glad thank you very much you pulled the door forward you know that says i'm enough of that i said not just a rude rude you know i said i've had enough of the others by the time i do a little bit something to try amen so that's what the holy spirit will help you to be a gentleman and that right that's what the holy ghost does it tells you what you ought to not do amen sure but anyway so for whoever needed that you brothers maybe amen don't forget to open their door and shut it and help her out help one another out now where we're at that's why i believe that's for every christian make a flame of fire put something in here now how many knows that truly the bottom line of it all that the equipment that we need is the holy spirit that is what you need to be equipped with because without that it doesn't matter how much you try what you do you're not going to be able oh i try and i try and i try yeah it's always you trying you're going to fail but if it's him trying it's a whole different story amen that's where it comes in where paul says i know how to abound i know how to have all i need and i know how to suffer need i know how to be full and not how to be empty i can do all things through christ but strengtheneth me and the secret was in galatians i believe it is this is the secret as we go into this paul says you know i am crucified with christ he says nevertheless i live in other words paul said i am leaving but yet it's not me yet it's not me but christ liveth in me and the life that i now live i live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god and that in there greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world he that is in the world can overcome nothing but he that is in me he will overcome hallelujah oh my so i wrote down here my notes so why can we not overcome why can't we have victory why do we have this cantor amen the random used the phrase might be kind of poor english but it's still i like the phrase he said talks about a cantor and he can her amen praise the lord let's talk about that for just a minute he says now some of you people walking along and say well i just can't quit drinking i just can't quit this and that he says the holy spirit comes to live in you to make all these cats get away from you praise be to god oh no excuses make them quit tattling that's what it's for to make you live a holy life to follow god's instructions in the bible every time amen how many please that's what the holy gets you to do to follow it every time no excuses amen praise the lord all right so i wrote down here the reason that we still can't we don't have the joy that we should have we don't have the love of god like we should other things are just more important to us than god come on folks we ain't got no hallelujahs we ain't got no shouts in the church anymore we don't have no miracles happening we're moss back backslid not what we ought to be how many wants to know why all right and i believe it's found our answer is going to be found in luke and also in matthew let's start with luke the 14th chapter i don't know about you but i love it when there's a problem but i love it more when there's an answer to that problem [Applause] [Music] because if you didn't have an answer to that problem then you couldn't do it you would be unable to solve that problem so jesus said in luke 14 verse 28 i'm going to jump around here a little bit verse 28 he says now for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost amen whether he have sufficience to finish it all right in other words can you finish this project can you do this or can't you do it that's what he's asking you can you do it or can't you do it right at least happily after he had laid the foundation he is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish it how many knows in ephesians 4 i believe it talks about how that god is building a tabernacle and we are that tabernacle that god is building amen that's right or what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consult us whether he be able all right with ten thousand immediate uncommons against him with twenty thousand in other words anybody that's smart or wise wants to make sure that you're able to do it how do i put this i don't believe that i have met anybody that just loves to be a loser i just love to lose you know i love to fail every time huh we like to slow things down we like to say oh man you know if we fail it disturbs us when we fail we don't want to fail we want to get it done we want it to happen right that's what jesus is saying here you want to know whether you're able to do it or whether you're not able to do it all right or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassador and desirous conditions of peace in other words he's so smart that if he knows he's going to lose he's going to make peace somehow he's going to come out on top here somehow right now notice that jesus would actually take these two parables before saying this all right conditions of peace so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple wow and i wrote down here that the reason that we can't do it a lot of times is because we fail to sell everything now notice if you're not willing to forsake everything for christ then you're not going to be the kind of christian that you're supposed to be now i wanted to go back to the beginning in verse 26 of chapter 14 of luke if any man come after me well let me go this way let me go back a little bit he was just finished talking about the supper that he made many were bitten and a lot of made excuses and so forth and there went a great multitude with him and he turned and he said unto them so how many knows when jesus began to teach something you better listen a great multitude if any man come after me and hate not his father mother wife children brethren sisters ye and his life also huh isn't that something he knocks out your family how many knows we all know there's not supposed to be anything as thick as blood nobody loves you more sticks together more than blood but jesus wipes that all out if any of that is more important to you to me then you ain't gonna be able to walk with me you ain't gonna be the kind of christian i'm looking for huh and not only family but also your own life your ways your thinking your ambitions your goals your prosperity whatever it is hello it better not be more important in christ and be with christ but people can't even make it to church i'm scared for you see i'm your pastor if i see somebody slacking on church i'm i'm getting worried folks i hate dislike as much as we did but [Music] to because of sickness but i believe church is important i believe you being at your post of duty is important it shows everybody of how much you love the lord or not hello now i notice your own life your own way people and that's why we still listen i got the quote for you but listen swiss that's right and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple amen all right where is this i'm looking for a certain thing here all right here it is see sometimes and i truly believe this that the reason that we can't if there's still too much of our own life in there there's still some of us in there there's still some you that's living maybe it's your business life maybe it's your private life huh your life of pleasure your you time everything has to be covered by the blood god wants every part of you every day that you live you want to be able to say just like paul it's not me that's living here it's christ that's living in me see god makes his children christians but sometimes they're halfway christians but it's not god's intentions for them to be that way it's their own ways that get mixed up in the plan of god for their life that's why we find so many people can't do it amen that's what makes them the way that they are it takes a complete surrenderence to jesus christ last scripture i want to go to matthew 13. matthew 13 this has to do with selling all right matthew 13 and verse 44. again the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a treasure head in a field the which one a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and self have you ever heard of being sold out how many sold out folk i am sold out and here's the problem for some of us probably it reads like this sell off some that he had a little did he have kind of like and hey we sold that land we sold five acres of land and we're giving the money to the church that's what they said we want to donate it to the church where he caused they come in there and gave it to him husband came gave it to him in that right says we're given this but they kept out a portion of it they kept out a portion of it and what did that make it a little white lie sure that's the land that's the money from the land but it's not all the money from the land and peter says why have you why has satan put in your heart to lie to the holy ghost amen see folks if people aren't honest with god they're probably not going to be honest amen think about it and it can be an honest neighbor that's right because you're dealing with god and then his wife also came in and said the same thing how many believes that if she said no no that's not right we only gave half we want to give half that's what we're given that lady would have lived she'd have stayed alive but she was like her husband i mean believes it's important to have a good husband to lead you right amen not on us not the full measure can we say that's how god feels when we only give him a certain portion of ourself he says you're not worthy to be called my disciple if you're not going to only have self has sell half out i want your all i want you mine i want your ambitions you goal everything about you your life well i tell you what i have certain things that i want to do and maybe he wants you to be a missionary maybe he wants you to be a preacher maybe he wants you to be an evangelist maybe he wants to do something for the kingdom of god huh think about it that's what you got to be willing to do if that's what god wants you to do i'll never forget when i come to the lord i says here i am lord whatever you want me to do i'll do it here i am i believe that's god honored that sacrifice he filled me with the baptism of the holy ghost and i've been trying to do just what god wants me to do ever since oh and i failed many times in many things hello but i truly believe i'm in the will of god i believe we're in the will of god i believe this is the will of god amen and i still see things in my life little things little areas in my life where i could say you know you need to get that surrendered that's right you might not think it's much but it is just little thing all kinds of little things like this morning about being a gentleman or you know being neighborly and being kind and have affection and so forth for for one another and pray for one another amen and need more of the love of god to share the gospel with my neighbors with those who i work with those around you there's only one going to be one treasure in heaven that's those whom you've won to the lord jesus christ those souls that'll be eternal amen so now those that's right he selleth all that he has because that's what it's going to cost you unless you're willing to give all that's right your feelings your emotions whatever it is it's got to be surrendered completely to god i believe with all of my heart that when you completely surrender to god and you don't you know that's exactly what god wanted israel to do when moses come down around them into that trap and there was nowhere to go anymore all god wanted to hear was look at what god did he's more than able to take care of our problem here i surrender my heart if hey if they come and kill me with the spear if that's god's will then let them kill me but i'm god's ain't no spear would ever got to them them oh my and they didn't god saved him despite their unbelief didn't he despite their unbelief he saved him all of those times delivered them all of those times because god is more than able amen praise the lord how many is glad to serve god that is able possible whatever we face in the future folks i'm telling you keep god in your heart i truly believe the holy spirit is calling both here and out there everyone to completely give themselves to him so that he might fill you with the fullness of christ and you'll be able to overcome whatever it is that you need to overcome and go through whatever you need to be able to go through because you're more than able because he is more than able in jude 1 and verse 24 jude he says now unto him that is able to keep you from falling amen and to present you fault lust before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy i truly believe that every eagle every son of god every predestinated child of god i mean there's something on the inside that god is working on and he is ultimately the one that is going to do it how many believes it but god has to take us through things and he's got to teach us all to surrender a little bit more and that's what we all come to church for this morning isn't it to get a little closer to the lord to walk a little closer with him and then it may be cold out there the world is black and dark and smart as as the bottom of the pits of hell out there this world is nothing but smut of hell it's horrible out there but in the midst of all of this he's got a shining light i mean people that are purified by the blood of jesus christ that asks for forgiveness of their sins they give themselves completely to god and say lord we're getting away from the world we're getting away from our own life every day a little closer to you lord surrendering more and more so that no matter what comes whether it's lions dens whether it's in uh daniels and the lion sense or whether it's fiery furnaces and folks i'm telling you right now you're in a fiery furnace of laodicea lukewarm mushy gushy jellyfish back boneless back no spine anymore and people hello just a bunch of gushing everything out but in the midst of it all he's bringing us together and forming some real strong amen christians that are going to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord why because we know he is our ability oh that's what little caleb could say we're more than able we're more than able how many this morning amen when you well first of all let's just check our hearts take eric check your hearts maybe everybody's perfect in here i hope you are i know i'm not but look at your heart say you know there's this area in my life that i really haven't surrendered yet like i need to and that's where my ways are getting mixed up that's why i'm not the christian that i should be i'm not a complete christian like i should be that's right i know my faults i know exactly what it is and i hate to think huh that's right i've already confessed it to you all a bunch of times but anyway just little things the devil try to slip you up you know no matter what it is but you know god looks at your heart he looks into your heart he looks at every one of our heart he knows just what it is i know where i'm slack and say god help me i want to surrender all to you lord you're more than able to help me to be what i i'm supposed to be more than able but it takes me saying god i'm this morning selling my life it's all yours i'm trading my life lord for yours here i am how many is with me this morning stand with me say lord here i am i'm selling my life lord i'm giving it all not just partially it's this little partial stuff that causes you not to be able to do the things that you know you should do that's the bottom line of the message this morning it's our own ways that get in the way is why we're not able like i said i don't know who just you know but you know you know who you are you know what it is in your life that you can't overcome that you just can't get past there's no magic wands it's simply a complete selling of yourself to almighty god if you want the holy ghost it takes you completely to repent of every wrong say god i stop i quit i'm done with sin i'm done with unbelief i'm done with an unsurrendered life i'm done with a halfway life god and i'm giving it all to you lord i want to be completely victorious just like abraham yet lot he had his father he wasn't complete yet he still needed work just like we do this morning the rapture just lays right ahead of us i believe the holy spirit is doing a work this morning and everybody that hears my voice i believe he's doing a work in your life to get you to where you are a tabernacle for the holy spirit to live in to make you be able to say like paul i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me whatever comes my way god can handle it because he is the one that's living in my life lord jesus you see every hand each one surrendering just now to you lord each one selling out to you saying god here i am this morning father you i know what it is that i need to surrender you know what it is you know my thoughts and i'm surrendering it right now lord and i pray to god after this service today that i would not be the same anymore lord change me from glory to glory change me lord different than what i was yesterday different from last month and last year make me a better christian not worse lord help me to be better father more surrendered to you lord every aspect of my life lord i open every door and say god i say i want you to come in and just take it all out sell it all because i want that pearl of the holy spirit in my heart and in my life every day every minute of the day i want the peace the joy that passes understanding in my life i want that calmness that sweetness that makes me love everybody that makes me love my neighbor lake makes me love my brother father i pray in jesus name this morning lord through everything that we have went through father lord there be nobody with any kind of smut in their life no kind of guilt no kind of shame in their life lord not further away from you but closer lord as we see that day approaching god just because we've not had the services lord i pray that you would keep that water flowing lord every day in their life that sweetness of the spirit we love you lord jesus so much that it makes us hug each other love each other father no matter what because the bible says if we don't love one another how can we love god and we love you lord this morning with all of our heart we thank you for the peace that you have shed abroad in our hearts and in our lives and for your guidance every day each one of us thank you for the rebuked lord that you bring to us we need it lord thank you for the correction father because we want to be completely corrected we want this flesh to be corrected one of these days into a glorified body and we ask god that you look at every heart
