[0:00] is nothing so when the devil tries to
[0:01] bring fears on you know whatever it
[0:03] might be you shake them off God has the
[0:05] whole world in control he's not going to
[0:07] lose none of them if if I go it was my
[0:10] time to go so I don't have to fear that
[0:13] there's only
[0:14] peace with him he's the Prince of Peace
[0:16] you know
[0:17] stimulation by Revelation I said you
[0:20] give a lord a round of applause huh come
[0:22] on
[0:25] I might get fired up up here
[0:28] uh Luke 10 9 what do you say uh 19 he
[0:31] said bold I give you power to tread on
[0:34] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[0:35] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[0:37] any means hurt you and I was standing in
[0:39] this Rejoice not that the spirits are
[0:41] subject into you but Rejoice rather that
[0:44] you're
[0:45] names are written in heaven and in the
[0:47] spirit in the hour Jesus rejoiced in the
[0:49] spirit and said I thank thee oh Father
[0:51] the Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou
[0:53] has hid these things from the wise and
[0:54] prudent and revealed it unto babes and
[0:56] such as you know that's that's just
[0:58] another thing right there it's just such
[0:59] a blessing that we've got a prophet that
[1:00] he sent us a prophet message of the hour
[1:02] to open our eyes and to be able to grow
[1:05] closer in fellowship with the Lord you
[1:07] know closer than any other thing out
[1:09] there you know
[1:11] just makes the word more real to us you
[1:14] know if he is the word he said I'll be
[1:16] with you in you into the end of the
[1:18] world then we are the word being
[1:19] manifest we're walking talking word
[1:22] written pistols read of all men we
[1:24] should be seeing the same signs of
[1:25] Warriors fall in our life you know
[1:29] hello
[1:32] father for so it seemed good and that's
[1:34] like all things are delivered unto me of
[1:36] my father and no man knoweth who the son
[1:38] is but the father and who the father is
[1:40] but the son and and he to whom the son
[1:43] revealth him and he said he turned them
[1:45] to them his disciples and said privately
[1:47] blessed are your eyes which they see and
[1:50] that the things that you see and you
[1:52] know that just ties right in together
[1:53] and then I just wanted to add one more
[1:55] before we get going here this one just
[1:58] came to me last night
[2:00] in Revelations 12 9 he's sitting uh
[2:05] 12-7 and there was a war in heaven
[2:07] Michael and his archangels
[2:09] fought against the dragon and the dragon
[2:11] fought and his angels and they prevailed
[2:13] not neither was their place found any
[2:15] more in the heaven and there was a great
[2:17] drag cast out that old serpent called
[2:19] the devil and Satan which deceived the
[2:21] whole world he was cast out uh but who
[2:24] will he not deceive the Bride of Jesus
[2:27] Christ
[2:28] he was cast out of the whole Earth
[2:31] uh
[2:32] and and his angels were cast out with
[2:34] him and I heard a loud voice saying in
[2:37] heaven now has come salvation and
[2:39] strength and Kingdom of our God the
[2:41] power of
[2:42] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[2:44] is cast down which accused us before
[2:46] night and day before God night and day
[2:49] but
[2:50] they overcame by the blood of the lamb
[2:52] and by the word of their testimony
[2:54] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:58] I just love those scriptures
[3:00] you just take them you know just like
[3:02] brother Davey showed me that I mean you
[3:04] can stand on that you stand on that word
[3:06] of God huh and he was preaching that too
[3:09] and I I originally when I started
[3:11] thinking about this I was thinking about
[3:12] doing it the Wednesday before
[3:13] Thanksgiving because that would be the
[3:15] year actual that day it would be well
[3:18] that Wednesday last year this this year
[3:20] will actually be Thursday but needlessly
[3:22] but then we wouldn't have in service but
[3:24] I was going to call it thanks living you
[3:26] know not Thanksgiving thanks be to God
[3:28] I'm here you know by God's grace and uh
[3:30] so but I hope it's just an encouragement
[3:32] to y'all to get you know uh to get out
[3:34] of your comfort zone for Jesus you
[3:37] no I you know it's worth it'll be worth
[3:40] it all to you all the growing and the
[3:41] growth that you'll have in the
[3:42] fellowship with him he's our best friend
[3:44] he'll help you overcome everything the
[3:46] devil throws at you he will never fail
[3:48] you you just pray for some more
[3:49] Revelation more stimulation by
[3:51] Revelation too pray for more faith you
[3:54] know
[3:55] and uh he stopped right here uh yeah I I
[3:58] got a few other things let me add here
[4:00] uh but I was thinking about as my
[4:01] fellowship's grown with God you know as
[4:03] we start walking in the spirit as
[4:04] healing Spirit we can start seeking him
[4:06] in different ways and and he can talk to
[4:08] us you know I have devotionals and
[4:10] things that he can it feels like he's
[4:11] speaking straight to me just when I'm
[4:13] seeking for answers he knows exactly
[4:14] what to get to me when I need to I
[4:16] believe that's just some fellowship with
[4:17] him he knows how to do it and he can use
[4:19] whatever he has
[4:20] so you know brother Ron Spencer was up
[4:22] there preaching up here at them
[4:23] Louisiana meetings he was up here he
[4:25] said he seen brother Tim Hewitt up here
[4:27] uh with his iPad he said he was sitting
[4:28] back here and he said the iPad started
[4:30] scrolling going in clicking coming in
[4:32] going in all by itself was going in
[4:34] clicking and clicking it like picked out
[4:36] the uh part of the sermon brother Brown
[4:38] on pre-stone for him and he kept on
[4:41] going he didn't know what was happening
[4:42] but it was what was it the spirit of the
[4:44] Lord he's in there doing all that so he
[4:46] can work through them things you know
[4:47] and and you know just get you going you
[4:50] know and uh just like I sent you this
[4:53] morning you know part of the one of my
[4:55] devotionals said that oh Lord thou cat
[4:58] thou has pleaded the cause of my soul
[5:00] thou has redeemed my life that thanks
[5:02] living a grateful Spirit should you know
[5:04] a grateful heart I should give back with
[5:06] gratefulness I should you know be
[5:08] grateful for what God's done for me A
[5:09] Grateful Spirit ever cultivated by the
[5:12] Christian especially after deliverances
[5:14] we should prepare a song for our God you
[5:17] know I was like you know so he started
[5:18] speaking to me like you know you know
[5:20] Lord You're On Track
[5:22] we can be a fool for Christ you know uh
[5:25] I was like that's part of that's in here
[5:27] too I started talking about you know we
[5:28] talk about being a fool for Christ but
[5:30] when do we put it to practice so so we
[5:32] get to practice you know and I was even
[5:34] thinking you think it says fear not uh
[5:36] for perfect love casts out fear so I was
[5:39] like okay you know so if we're
[5:40] overcoming fears we're for trying to
[5:42] perfect love
[5:45] but uh
[5:46] he said all the Earth should be filled
[5:49] Temple filled with the songs of grateful
[5:51] Saints and every day should be a century
[5:53] of smoking sweet in a sense of
[5:54] Thanksgiving up to the Lord
[5:56] uh and then uh this popped up uh the
[6:00] lifeline ever more every Sunday morning
[6:02] we'll put a new audio up
[6:04] and this was brother Brown this morning
[6:08] [Music]
[6:29] for sure

[7:18] [Music]
[7:33] amazing
[7:36] foreign
[7:39] [Music]
[7:44] you know we get fellowship with him you
[7:47] know I mean what does he long for from
[7:49] the very beginning before the foundation
[7:50] of the world we had this on his mind he
[7:53] longed to have the fellowship
[7:55] with us you know
[8:00] so I'm just here to give a praise report
[8:02] of my own my growing with the Lord words
[8:05] can't describe you know what the Lord's
[8:07] what the Lord this trial is meant to
[8:10] make God literally made my trial a
[8:12] blessing I know the scriptures say our
[8:14] trials are more precious than gold and
[8:16] silver but in the middle of the storm
[8:18] you you can't see it but I'm here to
[8:21] tell you no matter what you're going
[8:22] through God can make your child a
[8:24] blessing you only believe in trust in
[8:26] him he's one of one of the biggest
[8:28] trials for me before this one was I was
[8:31] locked up and Tammy mailed me this song
[8:33] and don't mind if I could if you if you
[8:35] don't know it I'd like to share it with
[8:37] you
[8:39] says I've just come into a valley one
[8:43] like I've never been before
[8:44] I keep searching for a way out seems
[8:46] like padlocks are on the doors oh there
[8:49] must be another sunrise or another
[8:51] Sunset I'll see God will
[8:53] make this child a blessing
[8:56] that's the love he has for me I was not
[8:59] the first one to come into this place
[9:01] you see every child of God this test he
[9:04] must face
[9:05] it is here that God will mold you and
[9:07] make you what you ought to be God will
[9:09] make his trial a blessing just be
[9:11] patient you will see
[9:13] now I'm standing on the Mountaintop
[9:15] looking back I can see when I was in the
[9:18] lowest Valley his strong hand was
[9:20] leading me
[9:22] always good to see the sunshine and
[9:24] sweet they Sweet Victory God has made my
[9:27] travel a blessing and that's the grace
[9:29] he gives to me
[9:31] and God will make this trial a blessing
[9:33] though that sends me to my knees though
[9:36] my tears fall like a river and in him
[9:38] their sweet relief
[9:40] there's no need to get discouraged
[9:42] there's no need to talk defeat God will
[9:45] make his trial a blessing in the whole
[9:46] wide world will see
[9:49] just blessed to be the name of the Lord
[9:51] man he knows how to do it all you know
[9:54] and uh I said you know sometimes it's a
[9:57] God he'll lay us on our back you know
[10:00] the prophet says sometimes God last on
[10:01] her back say where our great blessings
[10:02] come from you know when you when you
[10:04] have the Enemy at the gates and trying
[10:06] to kill you and the doctors and the
[10:07] devil and everything online trying to to
[10:09] get me to you to to get tell me I got to
[10:12] get used to the new me get used to the
[10:14] new you pretty much felt like my life
[10:16] was over with the way everything they
[10:18] had described to me and what they had
[10:19] said and that it would never fall
[10:21] holy heal it was a really dark situation
[10:24] but God was rich in Mercy spared me and
[10:26] gave me Grace to reflect on my life I
[10:28] had a lot of regrets and made a bunch of
[10:30] promises to the Lord from all my years
[10:31] of being stagnant and complacent on God
[10:33] no Victory barely any kind of
[10:35] relationship just one-sided but his
[10:37] anchor was holding me and after all that
[10:40] God's Grace has saved me from and
[10:42] delivered me from drugs and alcohol in
[10:43] the back and spared my life countless
[10:45] times I still didn't have enough fire to
[10:47] testify for my king or stand and
[10:49] overcome fears for him not but not me
[10:53] done he's worthy to be for me to lay
[10:56] aside all my fears and got on my comfort
[10:57] zone you know whether it's clapping
[10:59] praising God singing no matter what
[11:01] you're doing if you're making a little
[11:03] effort he'll see it and
[11:07] we just give our comfort zone if we got
[11:09] things that we need to overcome you know
[11:11] just take that step towards him
[11:14] get rid of it take it towards him lean
[11:17] on his word and try to try to get some
[11:19] devotionals do them things like I was
[11:21] saying that would draw you closer to him
[11:23] and to walk in the spirit as he's in the
[11:25] spirit the more spiritual you get the
[11:27] better off you'll be
[11:29] and and that
[11:32] he I said uh here I was like if we get
[11:35] off our comfort zone like he did I'm
[11:37] sure he was a little bit uncomfortable
[11:38] going to the cross and being put to
[11:40] death for something he didn't do oh my
[11:42] when you think of it the Amazing Grace
[11:44] but what because I had no Victory I
[11:46] hadn't I had an addiction to YouTube
[11:48] Instagram TV and just being plain old
[11:50] lazy on God in hindsight 2020 I can see
[11:54] that the main thing was I I've heard it
[11:56] preached a million times we don't we
[11:58] don't see the fire in the church because
[11:59] I ain't doing what I'm supposed to at
[12:00] home and that's the truth because I had
[12:02] put everything before God I didn't have
[12:04] a good fellowship with the prince of
[12:06] peace and so when I came to church with
[12:09] convictions instead of Victory I had
[12:11] hardness because of it was snowballing
[12:13] you know walking in the spirit I wasn't
[12:15] feeding the spirit I wasn't cooked I
[12:17] couldn't walk in the spirit because I
[12:18] wasn't feeding the spirit like I should
[12:19] have been but the Lord it was just like
[12:22] a revolving door not feeding that you
[12:24] know it was that that black dog was
[12:26] coming robbing me in my food that I was
[12:28] forfeiting by poor
[12:31] forfeiting him that and that poor poor
[12:35] me poor me mentality steps in you know
[12:37] and so many many uh man can get wore out
[12:40] trying to feel that thirst still with
[12:42] emptiness
[12:51] Tammy said we should pretty much it out
[12:54] it's an awesome spot
[12:56] uh
[13:02] man can get wore out trying to feel that
[13:04] thirst
[13:05] and still with emptiness but when he
[13:09] said come unto me all you that are heavy
[13:10] laden and I will give you rest take my
[13:12] yoke upon you for my yoke is easy and my
[13:14] burden is life see he wanted to bear
[13:16] that load with us you know uh we're
[13:19] battling an enemy that we can't defeat
[13:21] without him the devil in ourselves but
[13:24] as dark as it it can get in the hospital
[13:26] room Jesus Christ stepped in and turned
[13:28] the lights on gave me some stimulation
[13:30] my Revelation that I'd be healed I took
[13:33] him at his word and I got out and I've
[13:35] been I've been believing in going on
[13:36] God's worked more miracles in my life
[13:39] since then but the main thing I wanted
[13:41] to show is just how awesome and mindful
[13:43] the Lord is and how he's changed my
[13:45] devotion to him and it's transformed my
[13:47] life
[13:49] more of him I pour the more of me I pour
[13:52] out the more him he pours in and back
[13:54] and forth the more I pour him out the
[13:56] more I testify him like he said that
[13:58] stimulation boy you start even just
[13:59] talking about the praising God you
[14:01] started he didn't have he just
[14:03] started they start firing up don't they
[14:04] huh it just gets you fired up that's
[14:06] what you just want to pour out more
[14:07] because he can pour more in there you
[14:09] know
[14:09] um but uh
[14:12] uh
[14:17] I see yeah I said this was pushing
[14:19] behind me you know he's the life Giver
[14:21] pushing though pushing that that fire
[14:23] that Zeal from God Almighty he inhabits
[14:25] the pros as people he gives the joy
[14:27] unspeakable and full of drawer it comes
[14:29] it's a piece that passes understanding
[14:31] and it comes from an ongoing growing
[14:32] fellowship with a prince of peace he
[14:35] loves us and just Longs for our
[14:36] fellowship that's where we were on his
[14:39] mind before the foundation of the world
[14:40] Hallelujah and how he's so mindful of us
[14:43] and another little testimony down there
[14:45] in Louisiana you know and uh you know I
[14:47] I'd have to think too on things you know
[14:49] because God's word says it I believe it
[14:52] but you know we got examples like you
[14:54] know let's say brother bring them his
[14:55] stomach problem you know I mean we've he
[14:57] worked millions of Miracles you know but
[14:59] just because he didn't get it
[15:00] immediately he kept believing pressing
[15:02] the Mark we keep believing it anyhow you
[15:04] know so just because but anyway I'm down
[15:06] there they was having a little prayer
[15:08] line down there at the Louisiana thing
[15:09] and uh I wasn't even gonna go up and I'm
[15:12] like well I'll go ahead and go because
[15:13] I'm like you know because part of you if
[15:14] you're going to go up and get prayed for
[15:15] you almost think well I'm doubting you
[15:18] know because this word done says it I
[15:20] believe it I receive it but you know
[15:22] still no you can still go get prayed for
[15:23] it but so I went ahead and was it up
[15:26] here and uh
[15:27] I think it was brother Timothy Pruitt he
[15:29] came behind me and started praying and
[15:32] then Ron stepped over and he put his
[15:34] hand on my heart and he started
[15:36] praying and he was saying something and
[15:39] then it was like he was saying you know
[15:41] and brother Ron he's had you know
[15:42] visions and different things y'all know
[15:44] and it was like I thought you know
[15:46] because you know the chaos of the prayer
[15:48] line you know everything that was being
[15:49] said I got out I was like I'm pretty
[15:52] sure like he was saying that you know
[15:53] that uh I was gonna receive my healing
[15:56] but I was like man I I wanted so bad
[15:59] go back and ask him you know because I'm
[16:01] like you know well anyway the next day
[16:02] uh I was out there always out there I
[16:05] was talking to him and stuff and I never
[16:06] asked him you know I didn't think
[16:07] nothing of it then we was going back in
[16:09] about an hour early to get in and get
[16:11] our seats you know and I'm like man if
[16:12] he's still out there I'd like to ask him
[16:13] you know and plus the anointing of
[16:15] someone in the prayer line he may not
[16:17] even know what he said you know but but
[16:18] I was like if he's still out there maybe
[16:20] I'll ask him you know just see if he's
[16:21] saying something
[16:23] and uh I go back out there he wasn't
[16:25] there I'm like Lord I mean you know you
[16:27] already know it's already written I
[16:28] already believed it anyway I don't have
[16:29] to have that if you was trying to tell
[16:31] me something you can get him to say
[16:32] something to me you know I heard
[16:33] whatever
[16:34] and then in the middle of that service
[16:36] he called me out he stopped and called
[16:38] me out and uh said you know you thought
[16:40] you come down here you was making a
[16:42] table for someone and you thought you
[16:44] was coming down here and deliver a table
[16:45] but because the Lord showed him that
[16:48] because you've done something for a
[16:49] servant of the Lord uh you're gonna have
[16:52] a hard job you know and you know that
[16:54] was just him being mindful of me I
[16:56] believe just give me that encouragement
[16:57] to just keep pressing the mark don't
[16:59] doubt just keep believing keep pressing
[17:00] on and it was just real encouraging just
[17:03] because you know I mean I already had
[17:05] his word like I said we already have
[17:07] this Revelation right here it's already
[17:09] done you know we're just waiting for it
[17:11] to just completely done that way we can
[17:13] have a Vindicated miracle that way we
[17:15] can come just slaying Devil's heads off
[17:17] what you got now just like wrote runs
[17:19] but you said boo devil you didn't have
[17:20] enough you know I love when he does that
[17:22] gets all part of you know he doesn't
[17:24] went through all kinds of stuff too but
[17:26] you know uh and truly I believe that his
[17:29] his word and power to be it's our
[17:31] weapons to overcome all things as he did
[17:33] you know it's that our means that we
[17:35] have we're more than conquerors through
[17:37] Christ you know I must decrease so he
[17:39] can increase and he that began the good
[17:41] work and we will finish it
[17:45] honored to hold this sword the word the
[17:48] prayers here my prayers here lately has
[17:50] been what I told you it's been you know
[17:52] isn't more skillful than us here because
[17:55] of it because if we're the bride of
[17:57] Christ we are able to speak the spoken
[18:00] word and we should get that revelation
[18:03] and I wish
[18:05] just take it as it is it says it I
[18:08] believe it we can't emphasize on that
[18:10] enough you know it just that's the
[18:12] stimulation about Revelation because
[18:13] blessed be the name of the Lord
[18:15] get me fired up thinking about it just
[18:18] talking about it praise God all right
[18:22] y'all can amen y'all can amen hallelujah
[18:25] you want to uh
[18:28] you know and you know
[18:30] brother Brian she said why cry speak
[18:32] what's he talking about speak the spoken
[18:33] word no taking him you know we already
[18:36] both face any giant anything that we
[18:37] have using this word we should be able
[18:39] to see results by using this word if we
[18:42] doubt not and only believe you know and
[18:45] uh it says uh fear not be only this man
[18:48] you know how can we not boldly stand on
[18:51] that in the face of our enemy and the
[18:53] fears that we have whatever that it
[18:55] might hinder the praise of our King of
[18:57] Kings can you imagine Little David
[18:58] saying I ain't good enough to sling that
[19:00] stone
[19:01] I ain't no good he didn't look at that
[19:04] he didn't look at that he looked at God
[19:05] and where his help come from what about
[19:07] in Joshua and Caleb you know they go out
[19:09] there well there's like nah man we all
[19:10] right
[19:12] covers we can't do it nope we can bust
[19:14] the devil in the mouth and be like
[19:15] brother Ron Spencer like I said boo
[19:17] devil you didn't have enough we'll say
[19:18] it again you know because what we're
[19:20] gonna do we can go together all of us we
[19:21] can be on a head hunting Mission
[19:22] together uh to hunt every devil down
[19:24] snuff them out in our lives we got them
[19:26] all around us trying to defeat us but
[19:28] there's more of a scenarios of them
[19:29] blessed be the name of the Lord
[19:32] you know
[19:39] Lord he's worthy of all praise we can
[19:43] Praise Him in spirit and Truth let us
[19:45] walk in the spirit walk higher and
[19:47] higher until we just walk on out of here
[19:48] as mature mature bride of Christ you
[19:51] know if God before us who can be against
[19:53] us now I have this you know I have a
[19:55] revelation that neither like Paul did
[19:58] neither death nor anything that was
[20:00] separated from the love of God blessed
[20:02] be in the name of the Lord
[20:03] foreign
[20:09] myself a bunch of times when using guys
[20:12] work more effectively
[20:14] you know and I'd prayed you know like I
[20:16] said you know for Lord you know all my
[20:18] life I had you know the way I grew up I
[20:19] had TV in my life all my life you know
[20:21] and I remember after I was out of the
[20:22] hospital I'm like you know I think like
[20:24] you know brother Tom and other people
[20:25] and I'm just like I don't know what
[20:27] y'all do it without TV you know I've had
[20:28] TV all my life so it's just like man I'm
[20:31] praying Lord I don't know where you do
[20:33] it but you know God just started taking
[20:34] my desire from it taking my desire from
[20:36] I'm like you know and I so I then you
[20:38] kind of have a little bit more idle time
[20:39] you know you read your Bible and you
[20:41] pray but you still got a little bit of
[20:43] that relaxed time you want to relax you
[20:44] know and you know I still watch YouTube
[20:46] some stuff but I ain't got that addicted
[20:48] mentality like I did you know you can
[20:51] control it you know and TV's all right
[20:52] if you use it for a good thing you know
[20:54] we can watch sermons we can watch good
[20:55] stuff on there but you know I ain't
[20:58] sitting here but anyway yeah uh the
[21:01] whole point is that's when I started
[21:03] kind of picking up a little guitar I was
[21:04] like you know if I just stuck with it a
[21:06] long time ago maybe I could do something
[21:07] but I was like you know I can get out
[21:09] here in the basement just make a joy of
[21:10] noise for the Lord you know it gives me
[21:12] some clean uh hobby to do and uh well
[21:17] the Lord started dealing with me I ran
[21:18] up on this verse and said sing unto him
[21:20] a new song played with play for him
[21:22] skillfully with a loud noise
[21:24] you know and then I sit here uh
[21:28] be a fool for Christ you know when we
[21:30] practice that if I was a good singer it
[21:32] wouldn't be much of a sacrifice to get
[21:33] up here you know what I'm saying but uh
[21:36] you gotta have something to overcome and
[21:38] and this is where he really started
[21:40] dealing with me is the lifeline
[21:42] devotional that day that the sermon was
[21:44] titled so whatever he says to you do it
[21:47] and then he and there is on the lifeline
[21:50] it says if you if you there's no battle
[21:52] then there's no Victory but if you have
[21:54] to you have to have a battle to have the
[21:57] victory if it was just given to you it
[21:59] wouldn't be no wouldn't be no Victory
[22:01] but he that overcometh is the one who
[22:04] has the victory so Jesus came to the
[22:06] Earth and had a battle he won the
[22:08] Victory and tonight we have a battle and
[22:10] with Christ we can have the victory that
[22:12] was that and then the verse was like I
[22:15] was like I don't know but oh a song sing
[22:18] unto the Lord of no song for he had done
[22:20] marvelous things in his right hand and
[22:22] His holy um that's when I started
[22:24] thinking Lord
[22:25] you know I'm like nah you know hey I
[22:27] ain't there yet you know what I'm saying
[22:29] I ain't ready to sing but then all of it
[22:32] then he starts speaking to me and then
[22:33] you even preaching there and uh you had
[22:36] made the comment about healing healing
[22:38] coming by music you know and you start
[22:39] talking about letting the worshipers
[22:41] arise you know and uh Tammy sent me this
[22:43] one and said the she just sent me she
[22:45] didn't know the Lord had already started
[22:47] dealing with me a little bit about this
[22:48] but he said shame on you people who
[22:49] don't believe in strange music no wonder
[22:51] he was just brother Brown no no wonder
[22:53] evil spirits never like it they they
[22:55] have to get away David cast out Devils
[22:58] by playing on a string instrument that's
[23:00] what the scripture says that's right
[23:01] when David will begin to play the evil
[23:03] spirit would leave Saul is that right so
[23:05] this little boy was born for the world
[23:07] for a purpose you believe that
[23:10] and uh so so and then you start talking
[23:13] about that you know and so I felt like
[23:15] that thanks living testimony you know
[23:16] and sacrificing and myself to get up
[23:19] here and sing a song to magnify the god
[23:21] it seemed fitting for the time and
[23:22] season you know I said I'm not I'm not a
[23:24] singer I'm not I'm I sit up here and try
[23:26] to make a Joyful Noise for the Lord I
[23:28] want it to be more kind of more like
[23:30] that woman what what is what is she uh
[23:33] what was it the woman that gave she gave
[23:35] all she had she was poor but she gave
[23:36] off she had and they gave out of the
[23:38] bones of her heart but he said she gave
[23:39] more you know I'm saying I might not
[23:41] have ten thousand dollar boys but if I
[23:43] got a penny voice I want the Lord Bell
[23:44] to say he gave all he had with what he
[23:46] had you know if we can do that for the
[23:48] Lord I believe he'll be happy with it
[23:49] you know and uh
[23:52] so if we can just make it Lord proud
[23:53] that's all that matters
[23:55] and uh but I seen it I've seen it felt
[23:58] see I felt like singing another song
[24:01] after it you know as y'all could
[24:03] probably see if y'all know how I am I
[24:05] kind of go over the top with things
[24:08] you know overdo things or you know the
[24:10] next thing I know in my mind I'm
[24:13] like you know we can sing this song we
[24:15] could do the singing victory after that
[24:16] and actually bring everybody into it I
[24:18] was picturing football you know I'm like
[24:20] then I was playing with Joshua then when
[24:21] I started singing I'm like
[24:24] that's just in my mind it sounded really
[24:26] cool
[24:27] we got some years of practice guys maybe
[24:30] one of these days we'll get there but
[24:31] not yet we ain't there yet
[24:34] so so uh we're gonna play a little bit I
[24:38] had the in my devotional I I did scratch
[24:40] that idea for playing
[24:42] the Sea of Victory we are gonna do a
[24:44] little tail end of it because I just
[24:46] thought you know it's super awesome if
[24:48] you know the song you know it it says
[24:50] the nerd you know you take what the
[24:51] enemy meant for evil and you turn it for
[24:53] good what do you do here you know devil
[24:55] won't take my life but turn it for
[24:56] greatest blessing of my life you know
[24:58] and it says I'm gonna see a victory why
[25:01] because I'm gonna say a victory you know
[25:02] you might very well see it today Jesus
[25:05] Christ here you know but then I was
[25:07] praying I started kind of hitting on me
[25:09] with uh with us with Grace with Amazing
[25:12] Grace because that's my first Christian
[25:13] song I learned and I'm you know down
[25:16] there in my basement I can play pretty
[25:18] good by myself but you know you get up
[25:20] here nervous in front of everybody your
[25:21] Lord willing to just help me but uh so
[25:24] that's where the devotionals the saying
[25:26] I'm talking about I'm like okay Lord if
[25:28] if you're thinking you want me to play
[25:29] Amazing Grace too uh
[25:32] let my devotional when I go up early in
[25:34] my quiet time devotional uh let it have
[25:37] something about Grace and then this is
[25:39] what it had and like maybe it's a
[25:43] coincidence so I'll flip back like I
[25:45] don't know 10 15 pages there wasn't no
[25:46] Grace nowhere I'm like well okay maybe
[25:49] maybe that's what you're telling me this
[25:51] is now Faith is a revelation from God
[25:53] now Faith is a revelation there's where
[25:56] I want to stay just a moment it's a
[25:59] revelation he has revealed this to you
[26:02] by his grace and it's nothing you did
[26:04] you didn't work yourself into faith if
[26:06] you ever had faith it was given to you
[26:08] by the grace of God and God reveals it
[26:10] to you therefore faith is a revelation
[26:12] the whole Church of God is built upon
[26:14] Revelation and that sermon is titled
[26:17] works is Faith expressed so we should be
[26:20] able to say our works
[26:22] manifesting our faith blessed be the
[26:24] name of the Lord and uh
[26:27] I was going to say yeah yeah
[26:30] can you pull the song up Micah
[26:36] I was just going to give you a little
[26:38] song that I've been working on the song
[26:39] had kind of uh
[26:43] I had started with one little verse in
[26:46] my mind I broke the line down I started
[26:48] with a line
[26:49] and uh
[26:51] uh
[26:53] I might have went on for a while
[26:54] actually I found another song I kind of
[26:56] started taking some chords from and uh
[27:00] uh
[27:02] yeah
[27:04] so if you see the course one all I want
[27:07] to do is glorify you and think on things
[27:09] honestly true uh that's where I started
[27:11] that and I don't know it just went just
[27:13] a little piece at a time I had no notes
[27:16] wasn't ever really trying to go anywhere
[27:18] with it but by the time I was done
[27:22] you know the main the main idea was you
[27:24] know you think in the battlefield of our
[27:26] mind we've we've been we we learned all
[27:28] kinds of bunch of junk we get scarred in
[27:31] our minds you know we've been taught
[27:32] wrong things and we have all this stuff
[27:34] but you know and we can raise a child up
[27:36] in the way we should go but without a
[27:38] new birth experience and God giving you
[27:40] some revelation
[27:43] you know we don't even know and so
[27:45] that's what my prayer was always or just
[27:47] you know teach me what to think you know
[27:50] you know I just want to think on things
[27:52] that are just honest and good report you
[27:54] know pure you know and think on them
[27:55] things so that was the kind of the
[27:57] inspiration of the course and that and
[28:00] and you know when you when I say that
[28:01] part I don't I know now what I didn't
[28:03] know then is you love me for the
[28:04] foundation you know that was because I
[28:06] didn't know how he longed so much to
[28:08] have that fellowship with me you know
[28:10] and when you you know a lot of that
[28:12] right there you can see it's pretty
[28:13] self-explanatory but
[28:15] but uh when
[28:18] uh I said I need you more I need you
[28:21] more I need you more Lord when I did I
[28:23] was broken you know that was because
[28:25] once you get the revelation of what
[28:27] you're up against the devil and your
[28:29] enemy and yourself we realize I need him
[28:32] more today than I did yesterday every
[28:35] day I need more of him you know because
[28:37] that battle increases we need more him
[28:40] that's kind of where where the thoughts
[28:41] came from with that and uh
[28:44] yeah it's just uh and Lord it's all it's
[28:48] all it's not me it's all you it's
[28:49] amazing grace all the way through that
[28:51] come from
[28:52] uh you know he chose us for the
[28:54] foundation in the world he had us on his
[28:56] mind you know so it wasn't nothing I
[28:58] done he started to work I mean he's
[29:00] gonna finish it so that's kind of just
[29:02] the gist of the story of the song
[29:05] let's get it
[29:11] yeah
[29:13] y'all pray for me yeah
[29:19] has some mercy and Grace in your hearts
[29:35] okay
[30:05] beautiful

[42:46] heaven as a sand which is upon the sea
[42:48] short
[42:48] and thy seed shall possess the Gate of
[42:51] his enemy you may be seated this morning
[42:54] I also want to read
[42:58] um just well you know this very well I'm
[43:00] just going to quote out of Matthew the
[43:02] 16th chapter Jesus answers said unto him
[43:06] uh blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for
[43:08] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed unto
[43:10] you but my Father which is in heaven and
[43:11] I send you thee that upon that thou art
[43:13] Peter Upon This Rock I will build my
[43:15] church
[43:16] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[43:19] against it
[43:21] so here we see in Genesis where he says
[43:23] your seed and we are the Seed of Abraham
[43:26] this morning if we are believers is that
[43:28] right he said we'll possess the gates of
[43:30] our enemy and then Jesus said I'm going
[43:32] to build my church on Revelation
[43:35] and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[43:37] against that so this morning I want to
[43:39] speak on the thought of the gates of
[43:40] hell
[43:43] the gates of hell
[43:45] and we'll find out what they are and how
[43:46] it is that we can withstand their attack
[43:49] on us and possess those Gates
[43:52] I'm just going to tell you right off how
[43:54] you do it second Corinthians 10 and 3 it
[43:56] says for though we walk in the flesh we
[43:58] do not war after the flesh for the
[44:01] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[44:03] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[44:04] down the strongholds casting down
[44:06] imagination every High thing that exalts
[44:09] itself against the God and bring a new
[44:11] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[44:13] of God
[44:16] so friends we have Gates that we fight
[44:19] our battle is in the mind right and so
[44:21] what Satan wants to do is he wants to
[44:23] come into our mind and affect us through
[44:25] these Gates we have five gates into your
[44:27] mind their imagination memory affection
[44:30] reasoning conscious these are the Gates
[44:32] of Hell friends
[44:34] because when the Satan when Satan
[44:36] possesses those Gates he makes your life
[44:38] hell
[44:39] he makes your mind stressed he does all
[44:41] kinds of sexes to get us disbelief but
[44:44] when we possess the gates and we can
[44:45] hold those thoughts out and we can't
[44:47] hold them up but we can we can overcome
[44:50] what he throws against us that's the way
[44:52] we ever overcoming life is because we
[44:55] deny Satan's thoughts that he's thrown
[44:56] into our mind the battle is in the mind
[45:00] don't ever forget that don't ever let
[45:02] Satan tell you it's something else
[45:03] everything else is just creating an
[45:05] atmosphere so that when he throws a
[45:07] thought into your mind you will believe
[45:09] his thought
[45:12] all we we contact this world with our
[45:15] five senses uh Tay's field to touch all
[45:18] that kind of stuff and smell and in
[45:20] sight but friends that's not the battle
[45:24] when you walk in that brother you walk
[45:26] down the street you see some sexy
[45:27] dressed woman that's not the battle
[45:30] the battle is what you think about it
[45:33] it's not a sin if someone walks through
[45:35] in front of me and I happen to look at
[45:37] her and you know and I just gonna look
[45:39] away but if I continue it because my
[45:41] mind says I want to look now I'm losing
[45:43] the battle but the battle is in your
[45:45] mind it's not the stuff you see around
[45:46] you when you're sick well you get cancer
[45:49] that's not your battle
[45:51] is how you think about it
[45:54] it's what you take you take Satan's
[45:56] thought about your cancer or you take
[45:58] God's thought about it there's your
[45:59] there's your your battle right there and
[46:01] you win or lose according to how that
[46:03] works out
[46:05] whether that kept the cancer what was
[46:08] your approach to it that's the whole
[46:10] battle and anytime Satan can get us
[46:11] looking at something else well this
[46:13] brother is my problem
[46:15] no he's not
[46:17] your spouse is not your problem
[46:21] your kids are not your problem your job
[46:23] is not your problem it's the way you
[46:25] think about it is your problem
[46:27] that's where you either lose or you win
[46:29] and Satan throws those thoughts into
[46:31] your mind every hour of every day and
[46:34] you fight that battle constantly
[46:37] it's never done
[46:40] so you say well who wins well according
[46:43] to who you believe
[46:46] it's according to who you believe you
[46:48] either believe Satan's thought about it
[46:50] or you believed God's thought about it
[46:52] and they're both preaching their own
[46:53] gospels and you have Satan's gospel and
[46:55] anything against God's word is Satan's
[46:58] gospel
[46:59] everything against his word and he
[47:01] brings everything he can and sometimes
[47:02] it seems so innocent it seems like well
[47:04] that's nothing wrong with thinking that
[47:06] but if you look at what it's going to
[47:08] lead to yes there might be something
[47:09] wrong with it so don't be deceived
[47:11] because he brings some word or he has a
[47:13] quote or a scripture because Satan uses
[47:15] those against you
[47:17] to justify what you he what you your own
[47:20] nature wants to do
[47:23] that's why we have so many denominations
[47:24] and people believe on all kinds of stuff
[47:26] because Satan gives them a word out of
[47:28] the Bible says well you can do this and
[47:30] you can believe that and you can do that
[47:31] God is love right then any kind of love
[47:34] is of God
[47:36] well we know that's not true
[47:38] there's a lot of perverted love out
[47:40] there that has nothing to do with God
[47:45] so we find out Satan gets to know you
[47:48] really well when you're really young
[47:52] he starts he starts observing you when
[47:54] you were born and he sees your
[47:57] grandparents your parents your siblings
[47:59] your uncles and aunts and he sees how
[48:01] all this stuff is affecting you and what
[48:03] kind of personality you have and then he
[48:05] decides how to attack you according to
[48:07] that personality and he starts
[48:09] immediately
[48:12] and he starts putting things in your
[48:14] mind he starts causing trauma he's just
[48:16] causing addiction he starts causing
[48:18] complexes he starts getting to be
[48:20] setting sins when you're just a two or
[48:22] three-year-old kid he's already laying
[48:23] the foundation for it
[48:26] and you get up to the age of
[48:27] accountability look around and you start
[48:29] thinking man I got problems
[48:32] because he started at a young age
[48:35] and I think some of you will be able to
[48:36] to witness with me on this you find out
[48:39] see here's the same does he looks at you
[48:42] to see how spiritual he thinks you might
[48:44] be he looks at you to see how if you are
[48:47] this seed of God and he don't know that
[48:49] but he will look for a certain character
[48:50] heuristics to determine if you are a
[48:53] seated God and if he thinks that you are
[48:54] one of gods he's going to give you
[48:56] special attention and he's going to do
[48:58] all he can to have you so messed up by
[49:00] the time of the time to give your heart
[49:01] to the Lord that you just don't even
[49:03] know what to do and you might have tried
[49:05] to serve God kind of like a
[49:06] five-year-old eight-year-old whatever
[49:07] but when God starts dealing with you
[49:09] Satan starts dealing with you and next
[49:11] thing you know you see so many of these
[49:13] young people running out here and
[49:15] running there and doing all kinds of
[49:16] crazy stuff you think well they must be
[49:18] the spawner saying
[49:21] and it's not true at all
[49:24] because Satan's been attacking them
[49:26] extra and when you you call this witness
[49:29] to this you are not a normal child when
[49:31] you were growing up you are different
[49:32] than your peers you always didn't fit in
[49:34] or you had something weird about you and
[49:36] you might have some kind of Oddball
[49:38] something and even you're you're
[49:39] different than your sibling sometime and
[49:41] all it was but there's something inside
[49:43] of you that was looking for satisfaction
[49:46] and your friends and your siblings and
[49:48] whoever else they could find
[49:49] satisfaction from Satan's satisfaction
[49:52] but you couldn't find it because that
[49:54] seed inside of you would never be
[49:56] satisfied with anything less than the
[49:58] word of God
[50:00] that's why you were weird
[50:04] I'm speaking for myself that was a
[50:06] strange kid I look back and say man feel
[50:08] it's amazing you even survived
[50:12] it's true hey this is what the prophet
[50:14] said about you
[50:15] I'm not making this up the prophet go
[50:17] look like he said he said your eyes
[50:19] different you never could fit in there
[50:21] you know what other kids could you you
[50:22] couldn't do it I tried to do it
[50:25] some of us tried to do it and you find
[50:27] out it just didn't satisfy
[50:29] aren't you glad of that
[50:32] praise the Lord what if you would have
[50:34] been normal
[50:35] he might not be here this morning
[50:38] I'm not saying you're not normal
[50:40] you're normal believers
[50:45] but this is what Satan does and the next
[50:47] you know you have this complex you say
[50:49] why do I fat this inferiority why do I
[50:51] have to control why do I have this be
[50:52] setting sin what to do that and you can
[50:54] trace it back into your mind and Satan
[50:57] has strong holds in your mind that he
[50:59] put that when you were just a kid and
[51:01] you're completely innocent what he was
[51:02] doing
[51:05] and now you're 15 years old you have to
[51:07] start overcoming
[51:09] and then your next thing you know you're
[51:11] 60 years old you're still fighting that
[51:12] same battle
[51:14] it doesn't go away friends but you can
[51:16] defeat those strongholds I'm saying the
[51:18] battle don't go away but I'm here to
[51:19] tell you this morning by the time I'm
[51:21] done if you don't believe you can do
[51:23] tear down that stronghold you ain't been
[51:24] listening to what God's trying to tell
[51:25] you because right now this morning you
[51:27] can get rid of those strongholds if you
[51:29] desire to
[51:31] [Applause]
[51:34] you know what it takes you stop
[51:36] believing Satan's gospel and start
[51:37] believing God's gospel
[51:40] that's all it's that simple friends it
[51:42] really is and here's what Satan does he
[51:45] will give you a complex then he'll turn
[51:47] around and offer you the cure for it
[51:51] yeah
[51:53] people have to be in control you see
[51:54] people who call them control freaks
[51:56] right I don't know that's a really good
[51:57] term but people always have to be in
[51:59] control very they'll use anger they'll
[52:00] use pouting to use everything to control
[52:02] the people around him that's a complex
[52:06] and so they had this complex they feel
[52:07] like they're out of control so what do
[52:08] they do go to anger there's something
[52:10] you need to get mad you need to control
[52:12] this with your anger because you can
[52:13] force these people you can intimidate
[52:15] them into being what you want them to be
[52:22] he uses a lot of things
[52:25] what's your weakness that's where that's
[52:27] where your Escape is signal off you and
[52:29] Escape The Escape into this Escape into
[52:31] that try you know go off and buy
[52:33] yourself you know that person alike you
[52:34] know that person
[52:36] this person at church treats me bad
[52:38] right I'm just gonna go with this right
[52:40] and so if he don't shake my hand or you
[52:42] know he says something that kind of gets
[52:43] on me he kind of picks at me a little
[52:44] bit and I walk away I said well you know
[52:46] what I don't need him anyways
[52:48] I don't need his Fellowship who is he
[52:51] I'm escaping into Satan's Escape
[52:55] because that's not the Holy Spirit
[52:57] Holy Spirit never told me to have that
[52:59] attitude towards that person
[53:01] it's Satan's stronghold
[53:05] amen
[53:06] so who wins
[53:08] whoever you choose to believe
[53:10] because see to believe Satan takes Faith
[53:12] also
[53:15] when Satan tells you something you have
[53:17] to have faith in what he's saying
[53:18] otherwise you won't do it
[53:20] when God tells you something you have to
[53:22] Faith what he's saying or you won't do
[53:23] it
[53:26] Satan tells a young kid he says you know
[53:28] what life is just unbearable
[53:30] why don't you kill yourself
[53:32] as takes faith in Satan's word to commit
[53:35] suicide
[53:37] it really comes down who do you believe
[53:41] that's all it is you choose
[53:44] you choose who to believe I'm gonna read
[53:45] something out of church but probably the
[53:47] most preached on or quoted scripture in
[53:49] the whole message but it's just amazing
[53:50] he says this have you ever noticed how
[53:52] Satan hates the two books of the Bible
[53:53] more than all others see liberal
[53:56] theologians a pseudoscientist he has
[53:57] always attacking the Book of Genesis and
[53:59] Book of Revelations both these books we
[54:00] find Satan's origin his awful ways and
[54:03] his destruction
[54:04] so this morning I hope we're going to
[54:06] see his awful ways
[54:08] this is why he attacks them he hates to
[54:10] be exposed
[54:12] this morning we're exposing Satan and
[54:14] his awful works
[54:17] [Music]
[54:18] he hates those books he explodes exactly
[54:21] what he is Jesus said about Satan he has
[54:22] no pardon me I have no part in him see
[54:25] Satan will tell you I got a part of you
[54:27] he said because of your own nature and I
[54:29] can affect you I can get in your mind
[54:30] and make a fight then I have a part of
[54:32] you but see what happened at Calvary is
[54:34] he said I paid the price you will no
[54:37] more long have you no longer have a part
[54:39] in my people because I have paid that
[54:40] off you have nothing to say he said but
[54:42] I still have this old nature you do have
[54:44] that and that's why we still have the
[54:46] fun the battle but for the real you he
[54:48] has no part in that because that is
[54:49] absolutely a part of God
[54:52] he has no pardon God then if you are
[54:54] born again he has no part in you you're
[54:56] just living in this battle in this body
[54:57] that he can still fight with and because
[54:59] of that is molding your character that's
[55:01] the only thing is for friends the reason
[55:03] we had these battles the Reason God
[55:05] allowed you to have that complex is to
[55:08] mold your character
[55:10] that's what it's about God allowed you
[55:12] to have that he allowed that sickness he
[55:14] allowed that temper he allows that be
[55:16] setting sin
[55:21] you say you can't do anything to you
[55:23] that he doesn't have permission from God
[55:25] to do
[55:28] ain't that amazing we give him too much
[55:30] credit
[55:32] way too much credit you do what you want
[55:35] to do that hurts my feelings I said God
[55:39] I don't want to do this and I do it
[55:40] anyways he says it's because you want to
[55:44] oh yeah but if you're born again you
[55:46] don't want to a party you've done your
[55:47] own nature does go ask what Paul said
[55:49] about it go back and read what part he
[55:51] said when I would do good and evil is
[55:53] with me
[55:54] that was the born-again church age
[55:56] messenger called Paul he struggled with
[55:58] that you think we're not going to
[56:00] since Satan country said if you were
[56:03] really born again you wouldn't have that
[56:04] desire
[56:06] if you knew what you're talking about
[56:08] you wouldn't be Satan
[56:13] friend without the Temptation we live
[56:16] perfect lives we don't need the blood
[56:18] anymore we don't need Christ anymore I'm
[56:21] just Zippy to do that through life
[56:22] because I have no more Temptation
[56:24] because all my desires are to serve God
[56:26] that's just not reality
[56:28] if you're trying to receive the Holy
[56:30] Ghost and you think you can get to that
[56:31] point where you don't ever struggle with
[56:32] those flesh anymore you're living in a
[56:34] fantasy world that's not gonna happen
[56:38] Jesus himself was tempted
[56:43] if Jesus was tempted how about us
[56:46] stop listening to Satan's lie and say
[56:48] Well if you really wanted to serve God
[56:50] you wouldn't have this problem or you
[56:52] wouldn't struggle with that or if you
[56:54] were really born again you wouldn't have
[56:55] these desires and you wouldn't fall into
[56:57] this and you wouldn't fall into this let
[56:58] me tell you something the most
[56:59] born-again person was still gonna make
[57:02] mistakes every day and the only way you
[57:05] can make a mistake is you believe
[57:06] Satan's life for at least a half a
[57:08] second
[57:12] you can't make a mistake without
[57:14] believing what saying told you to do
[57:18] I drive down the road you know and this
[57:21] happened man I'm driving down the road
[57:23] and I get a thought
[57:25] well so-and-so said this about me Maybe
[57:30] but what if he did
[57:33] and 20 minutes later I have worked
[57:36] myself up into a tizzy
[57:39] and I stop I look what are you doing
[57:41] Phil because I had all peace I had peace
[57:43] in my heart everything's fine I get a
[57:44] thought I stopped playing with that
[57:45] thought and whatever it is and 20
[57:47] minutes later I'm all tore up and I stop
[57:49] and say
[57:50] you're tore up about and lie that never
[57:54] happened
[57:55] damn you know what I'm talking about
[57:57] some of you probably don't some of you
[57:58] are above that
[58:00] but we get tore up about nothing what if
[58:03] that person thinks that about me
[58:06] oh my goodness and then pretty soon I
[58:08] don't want to talk to that person well I
[58:10] got an attitude well why because
[58:12] well two weeks ago driving down the road
[58:14] and the thought came that maybe he
[58:15] thought this about me
[58:19] you ever do that
[58:22] my makes me feel so weak
[58:27] he has no part in me I have no pardon
[58:29] him the devil would like to prove that
[58:31] different but he cannot so he does all I
[58:32] can to destroy confidence in the word
[58:34] he's trying to destroy your confidence
[58:37] in the word so when you come to church
[58:39] and brother Thomas is preaching he's
[58:40] telling you something but you have a
[58:42] memory or you have an imagination or you
[58:45] have a conscience or something and it's
[58:47] still just kind of like holding you back
[58:48] from believing and it causes doubt and
[58:51] that's all he has to do and just plant
[58:52] seeds of God in there yeah but is it
[58:55] really you yeah but could it really
[58:56] happen to you yeah but are you really
[58:58] sure what about that preach you left the
[59:00] message what about that person who did
[59:01] this and he tries to get you so you all
[59:03] tore up so your mind just be I believe
[59:05] what you're saying amen but is it but
[59:08] but
[59:09] because we had a little bit of Doubt
[59:11] Satan throws in there instead of
[59:12] extinguishing it right away we just kind
[59:14] of hold on because we're hedging our
[59:16] bets
[59:17] you know what that means hedge hedge is
[59:19] like like a you know like if you you put
[59:22] a hedge around your garden or your yard
[59:24] to keep people out like a Bounder right
[59:26] you gotta trim your Hedges right well
[59:27] there's something called a hedge fund
[59:29] and if you're into if you know
[59:31] anything about finances you can you can
[59:34] invest your money into your main
[59:36] investment over here but over here you
[59:37] put a hedge fund something that you know
[59:39] is not going to fail in case you lose
[59:40] all this over here you still have this
[59:42] to fall back on
[59:44] how many people have hedge funds when it
[59:46] comes to serving God
[59:48] I believe you Lord I know you're going
[59:49] to heal me
[59:51] but just in case
[59:54] just in case let me just hold on to this
[59:56] little something over here let me hold
[59:58] on to this doubt over here let me just
[59:59] don't want to be okay what if I'm a
[1:00:01] fanatic what if I go and claim I'm
[1:00:02] Healed and I die oh my goodness what
[1:00:03] will people think about me
[1:00:06] at that point I doubt if you're worried
[1:00:08] about what they're going to think about
[1:00:09] you
[1:00:14] but friends we're we don't you know we
[1:00:16] don't want to
[1:00:18] be too loud with our testimony
[1:00:21] we don't want to be too open with it
[1:00:23] because you know just in case
[1:00:27] that's Satan
[1:00:29] 's lie
[1:00:31] that's his thought he threw in there and
[1:00:33] you accepted it and it's got a nice
[1:00:34] little pretty potted plant growing there
[1:00:37] called Satan's lies you need to get rid
[1:00:40] of that thing
[1:00:42] yeah you need to get rid of it
[1:00:44] he says when the church disbelieves
[1:00:46] Satan and believes his spirit's
[1:00:48] revelation of the word the Gates of Hell
[1:00:51] cannot Prevail against her it is
[1:00:54] foreign
[1:01:14] you're going to pay for it friends God
[1:01:17] never sat there and said oh you're gonna
[1:01:18] get it
[1:01:21] your dad in my mind mom might have said
[1:01:23] that but God never said that to you he
[1:01:25] will bring the word and heal you he said
[1:01:27] yeah there's you know you report your
[1:01:29] soul but he doesn't sit there and try to
[1:01:30] bring some kind of threat you better be
[1:01:32] good
[1:01:34] come on
[1:01:36] it's not the way he treats his bride
[1:01:39] the only Power Satan has over you is
[1:01:42] when you accept his gospel
[1:01:44] any time when you have to accept it in
[1:01:47] order to have a bad attitude you have to
[1:01:48] accept it in order to get mad the wrong
[1:01:50] way in order to to to lie or anything
[1:01:53] that you do to be lazy
[1:01:57] these addictions you have to accept his
[1:02:00] life that that addiction is going to
[1:02:01] make you happier than God
[1:02:05] you have to believe that
[1:02:08] and when that stronghold has been put in
[1:02:11] there and Satan has access through that
[1:02:13] into that gate of your mind it's you
[1:02:15] have to have a deliverance from God
[1:02:17] because that can be so strong you can't
[1:02:19] overcome it in your own ability I'm not
[1:02:21] telling you that but God is here to tell
[1:02:23] you I have made this way for you and
[1:02:25] that's I'm going to reveal the word
[1:02:27] because he said the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:02:29] Prevail against the revealed work and so
[1:02:32] when God comes to you and says I have
[1:02:34] set you free and you believe that
[1:02:35] Revelation then you are free
[1:02:39] that's all it is friend it's just that
[1:02:42] simple you just believe what God said
[1:02:44] about you and that might not happen
[1:02:45] right away you might have to walk for
[1:02:47] the next week a month or a year or
[1:02:49] however long it takes but all you do is
[1:02:51] confess like God said about it and after
[1:02:54] a while that's gonna come to pass
[1:02:57] and it might happen immediately it might
[1:02:59] happen two years down the road but
[1:03:01] you're a Believer and so Saiyan goes
[1:03:03] down after doubt after doubt he says
[1:03:04] you're not healed yet you still have
[1:03:06] that complex you still have that complex
[1:03:07] you have to copy and all you do is say
[1:03:09] Saint I'm still healed shut up
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:14] that's all you have to do friends it's
[1:03:16] really that simple anything else you're
[1:03:18] just complicating it it's not Christ
[1:03:19] Christ is known through simplicity
[1:03:24] he said remember Christ in the true
[1:03:26] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:03:27] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:03:29] how the Antichrist Spirit we're coming
[1:03:30] to the church and defile it making a
[1:03:32] lukewarm formal Powers how does he come
[1:03:34] into the church through thoughts
[1:03:38] the Antichrist Spirit can come right
[1:03:40] here and stand right there in the aisle
[1:03:42] he's totally powerless
[1:03:45] and he accepts his thought
[1:03:49] he ain't nothing to be afraid he not a
[1:03:51] book hey man he's a bluff
[1:03:54] all he is is the bluff because he cannot
[1:03:57] force you to take what he's got to sell
[1:03:59] you it's your choice
[1:04:03] it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:04:06] which is attempt to destruction God and
[1:04:07] the discrediting of God's word I don't
[1:04:09] Minister a couple days ago he said that
[1:04:11] attempted destruction he said we can't
[1:04:13] even accuse we cannot even bring charges
[1:04:15] against Satan for murder
[1:04:16] just attempt and murder because he can't
[1:04:19] destroy you
[1:04:21] he can't kill you
[1:04:23] he can't destroy you he can't drag you
[1:04:25] out of this church
[1:04:27] he can't force you not to be a believer
[1:04:29] well you're not a Believer well if I
[1:04:31] believe I am Satan shut up
[1:04:34] it's that simple
[1:04:36] you decide say he doesn't decide if
[1:04:38] you're a Believer or not
[1:04:40] you do
[1:04:44] right down to the tiniest cast in the
[1:04:46] Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot
[1:04:47] stand he knows that the people gifted
[1:04:49] people get the true Revelation the true
[1:04:51] thank you
[1:04:52] church and what she is what she stands
[1:04:54] for she can do the Greater Works she'll
[1:04:56] be an invincible Army friends you are
[1:04:59] invincible Army when you deny Satan's
[1:05:01] his life brother Brian said that you are
[1:05:03] omnipotent he said we always bothered on
[1:05:05] everything he said don't you know you're
[1:05:06] omnipotent
[1:05:09] how do you do that
[1:05:10] if I believe and you get you let the
[1:05:12] word come in and you clean all those
[1:05:13] Gates out all those flus of the word in
[1:05:15] your mind and then the Holy Spirit can
[1:05:19] Express himself the way he wants to
[1:05:23] if they get the true Revelation the two
[1:05:25] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:05:26] Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:05:28] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:05:29] Spirit how do you just withstand it you
[1:05:31] just you just deny his thoughts just
[1:05:34] disbelieve him I'm gonna say it a
[1:05:35] hundred times today all you have to do
[1:05:37] is disbelieve Satan
[1:05:40] you want to walk out of here a Victor
[1:05:41] you just start right now by disbelieving
[1:05:44] Satan
[1:05:45] that's all you have to do I didn't feel
[1:05:48] anything
[1:05:51] he just say you're gonna feel anything
[1:05:52] do you believe him or not
[1:05:55] stop being a feeler be a believer
[1:05:59] he said when we just stand Antichrist
[1:06:01] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:06:03] her he'll be definitely forwarded to
[1:06:05] death
[1:06:07] Christ as soon as they're effort to get
[1:06:09] a power room in the desert Satan hates
[1:06:10] Revelation but we love it with true
[1:06:12] Revelation Our Lives against the hell
[1:06:13] cannot Prevail against him but we will
[1:06:15] prevail against them all you have to do
[1:06:17] friends is take God's word that he's
[1:06:19] revealed to you and stand on that
[1:06:22] that's all it takes it's all it takes
[1:06:24] it's really that simple
[1:06:26] foreign
[1:06:28] that word if you can get everything out
[1:06:30] of the way all conscious all senses and
[1:06:32] just let the word come in that word will
[1:06:34] produce just exactly see what it's
[1:06:37] covered over with you say well these
[1:06:39] conscious and senses so forth they don't
[1:06:40] have anything to do with their brother
[1:06:41] Branham certainly it does
[1:06:43] but if you let the word come in and
[1:06:45] cover it over with conscience then it
[1:06:47] can't grow
[1:06:48] what's he talking about condemnation you
[1:06:52] made a mistake yesterday didn't you
[1:06:55] if someone says no you just lied because
[1:06:57] we all made mistakes yesterday we
[1:06:59] answered it was nothing more than
[1:07:00] entertained Satan's thought for a while
[1:07:02] you know that thought comes in you can't
[1:07:04] help that thought come
[1:07:05] and then you don't have to entertain it
[1:07:07] you can recognize that Satan's thought
[1:07:09] and just ignore it it's like a
[1:07:10] rattlesnake just let it go and walk away
[1:07:12] it can't hurt you
[1:07:14] that's all and you just ignore it you
[1:07:16] walk away but probably some of us
[1:07:18] yesterday we entertained the wrong
[1:07:19] thought for a while and then what you
[1:07:20] had to do you had to repent
[1:07:23] you just said God I'm sorry unaccepted
[1:07:25] here's something else just a side note
[1:07:27] have you ever tried to convince God to
[1:07:29] forgive you
[1:07:31] oh if I praise this God please forgive
[1:07:33] me please he said Son
[1:07:35] you're wasting your time
[1:07:37] I already forgave you
[1:07:40] all I need you to ask for and accept it
[1:07:44] and move on
[1:07:46] you accept just forgiveness you accept
[1:07:48] his healing you accept it God says I all
[1:07:50] can do is point your Calvary God please
[1:07:51] forgive me he says there's Calvary
[1:07:53] remember the blood is still in effect
[1:07:56] do you still believe it do you accept I
[1:07:58] believe then why do you still begging me
[1:08:00] to forgive you for yes you have to ask
[1:08:02] for forgiveness but then you accept it
[1:08:04] because he cannot forgive you any more
[1:08:06] than he already has
[1:08:09] it's done the work is done
[1:08:12] my got off on that he said if you let
[1:08:15] the work come in and cover it over with
[1:08:17] conscious then it can't grow let me just
[1:08:19] read something here First John 3 20. it
[1:08:21] says if your heart condemn us God is
[1:08:22] greater than a heart and knoweth all
[1:08:24] things beloved if our heart condemn us
[1:08:26] not then we have confidence toward God
[1:08:28] so when we accept the Forgiveness that
[1:08:31] God has for us then he comes and we can
[1:08:33] walk in confidence without that
[1:08:35] confidence you can't have faith in what
[1:08:37] God's doing for you care faith in God's
[1:08:39] word because that condemnation is
[1:08:40] barring it that condemnation is giving
[1:08:43] you doubt
[1:08:44] but when you're not walking in
[1:08:46] condemnation you can have faith towards
[1:08:47] God that everything is right between you
[1:08:49] and him
[1:08:52] you can't live with condemnation he said
[1:08:54] brother Phil I would be setting sin I do
[1:08:56] this over and over I had this problem
[1:08:57] over and over I can't seem to get over
[1:08:59] it well welcome to the human race
[1:09:04] we all struggle with those things
[1:09:06] friends brother Branham struggle with
[1:09:08] those things he said not the prophet oh
[1:09:11] please let him be a human being
[1:09:14] he had the same problems we have friends
[1:09:18] you're gonna have problems you got
[1:09:20] things you struggle with and God allowed
[1:09:22] that to happen for you to overcome for
[1:09:24] you to learn how to fight for you to
[1:09:26] learn how to resist Satan for you to
[1:09:28] grow up and to be someone he can trust
[1:09:29] with his word
[1:09:31] that's what it's for
[1:09:32] but what what happened so many times we
[1:09:34] let that condemnation just drag us right
[1:09:36] out of church and well I'm so backslid
[1:09:38] well why
[1:09:41] who are you listening to
[1:09:43] who did you have faith in
[1:09:46] you had faith in Satan's word that you
[1:09:47] can't overcome that you can't live good
[1:09:49] enough that you're just always going to
[1:09:50] be this so you always going to have
[1:09:51] problems you have Satan in his word why
[1:09:53] don't you turn around have Satan in
[1:09:54] God's word that says that's already
[1:09:55] taken care of
[1:09:57] yeah
[1:09:59] that's all he's asking for
[1:10:05] he said if it cover it over the
[1:10:06] conscience it can't go to be a deformed
[1:10:07] word do you ever see a good grain of
[1:10:09] corn planted in the ground let it stick
[1:10:10] fall over it grows crooked anybody
[1:10:12] anything that grows up will be will
[1:10:14] become something that has handed it
[1:10:16] because something has hindered it and
[1:10:18] friends you can look around and your
[1:10:19] brothers and sisters in church and you
[1:10:21] can see deform see I know this sounds
[1:10:23] terrible I'm not saying go on picking oh
[1:10:25] this person's got a problem you're not
[1:10:26] doing that at all but friends you can
[1:10:28] see people who are not walking in faith
[1:10:30] because they've been deformed they've
[1:10:31] been hindered by something in their life
[1:10:35] you're seeing they're afraid to raise
[1:10:36] their hand and praise God they're afraid
[1:10:38] to shine their prey to sing they don't
[1:10:39] want to con oh I'll be it I feel like a
[1:10:41] hypocrite if I start praising God if you
[1:10:43] just knew the problems I had if you knew
[1:10:45] the things I struggled if you knew what
[1:10:46] I did last week and yeah I can't just go
[1:10:48] to church and just praise God like
[1:10:49] everything is okay you know why you
[1:10:51] can't because you still believe Satan's
[1:10:53] lie
[1:10:54] you better believe you can come to
[1:10:56] church and if it makes you feel like a
[1:10:57] hypocrite that's okay go ahead and do it
[1:10:59] anyways because even the Hypocrites
[1:11:01] should serve God they should worship God
[1:11:05] let them do it friend I don't care
[1:11:07] because he's worthy to be praised and
[1:11:09] one day everybody's gonna kneel and
[1:11:11] worship him so you might as well go
[1:11:12] ahead and do it now
[1:11:14] stop letting Satan rob you because once
[1:11:17] God's wanted to do he said I want to set
[1:11:19] you free but when you're walking in that
[1:11:21] God of fear I can't do anything for you
[1:11:23] you have to confess my work because then
[1:11:25] I can be a high priest of your
[1:11:26] confession and if you had a horrible
[1:11:28] thing you did yesterday and you feel so
[1:11:30] wrong and you feel so condemned and you
[1:11:32] repent and you come to church and you
[1:11:34] raise your head I'll accept your praise
[1:11:37] because now you're working in faith
[1:11:39] you're walking in faith not in some kind
[1:11:41] of condemnation Satan's throwing at you
[1:11:43] stop walking in that condemnation that's
[1:11:46] your own self-pity
[1:11:47] that's your wrong idea your your
[1:11:50] Catholicism well I had to do some kind
[1:11:52] of penance I had to feel bad for a while
[1:11:54] you will feel bad and you should feel
[1:11:57] bad and at the same time you should
[1:11:59] repent and raise your hand and worship
[1:12:00] God because he's still worthy to be
[1:12:03] worshiped
[1:12:05] I don't care if you feel like a
[1:12:06] hypocrite or not
[1:12:08] you're not a hypocrite if you're doing
[1:12:10] it in faith
[1:12:13] stop listening to Satan's lies friends
[1:12:16] it keeps us it keeps us from our victory
[1:12:20] well when I start living good enough
[1:12:22] I'll start coming to church
[1:12:27] that's just that's criminally stupid
[1:12:31] friends you come to church this is the
[1:12:33] hospital this is where the healing takes
[1:12:35] place
[1:12:37] and you can come to the hospital but if
[1:12:39] you're an accepted the remedy the doctor
[1:12:41] gives you you're going to leave sick
[1:12:44] praise the Lord but if you will come and
[1:12:47] you accept what he's given which is the
[1:12:49] word preach to you you can walk out of
[1:12:51] here well you can walk out of your
[1:12:53] healed you cannot walk out of here
[1:12:55] delivered but you have to accept what's
[1:12:57] saying and Satan said well that's not
[1:12:59] for you well you know you're just gonna
[1:13:00] have a problem with you claim your field
[1:13:02] you claim your delivery you claim all
[1:13:03] this and kind but you know you go out
[1:13:05] and do it again
[1:13:09] you know what you say
[1:13:11] so what I'm still a believer
[1:13:15] there will come a time Satan when my
[1:13:17] foot will be on your neck
[1:13:20] and you will be done
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:24] you will be done that stronghold will be
[1:13:28] gone
[1:13:30] because I took God's word at it
[1:13:39] where am I at
[1:13:41] that's what matter what he said that's
[1:13:43] what's the matter with the Pentecostal
[1:13:44] faith today let me just tell you that's
[1:13:46] what's the matter with the message
[1:13:47] Believers faith today we let too many
[1:13:49] things hinder it the faith we've been
[1:13:51] taught the Holy Spirit that's been
[1:13:53] living in us we let too many things
[1:13:54] looking at somebody else
[1:13:57] the devil is always trying to point you
[1:13:59] to somebody's fair but he tries to keep
[1:14:00] away from the real testimony at genuine
[1:14:03] he had a testimony this morning the
[1:14:05] genuine when he was sent out I said man
[1:14:06] that goes right along with my notion by
[1:14:09] the way who was that I don't even know
[1:14:10] who
[1:14:11] God bless you both
[1:14:15] let me ask you something
[1:14:17] you who have been going here for
[1:14:19] last 20 years 10 years whatever
[1:14:22] what if you had to sit down and write up
[1:14:24] in a book all
[1:14:27] the things God has done in this
[1:14:29] congregation
[1:14:30] the Miracles Deliverance the healings
[1:14:32] the bap atisms all the stuff God has
[1:14:36] done and that you have a book that thick
[1:14:39] you can look at all the people that
[1:14:40] you're sitting here that you're going to
[1:14:41] go into church with for years I remember
[1:14:42] God did something in her life some of
[1:14:44] his life some of his life and again and
[1:14:46] again and again and you in your own life
[1:14:47] you'll have so many things that God has
[1:14:49] done you could write another book of
[1:14:51] Acts couldn't you
[1:14:55] is exactly right friends another book of
[1:14:57] Acts and it's right here and yet it's
[1:14:59] done so simple
[1:15:00] and so under the radar that would just
[1:15:03] go week to week week to week oh praise
[1:15:05] God God did this for that person praise
[1:15:07] God next oh God and now we're praying
[1:15:09] for this person and two weeks later oh
[1:15:11] God did that for that and then we just
[1:15:12] keep going we just keep going to Satan
[1:15:14] just gets that out of your mind so you
[1:15:15] don't dwell on those things
[1:15:19] but you know what we talk about uh
[1:15:21] brother so-and-so's back so they're not
[1:15:22] in church again today
[1:15:27] oh I'm just having a rough day
[1:15:31] your own confession friends Satan gives
[1:15:33] you thoughts God gives you thoughts
[1:15:36] but until you put him towards those
[1:15:38] thoughts are kind of powerless in a lot
[1:15:40] of way now they can have effect on you
[1:15:42] but if you don't put them to words
[1:15:43] there's a lot less power to it because
[1:15:44] God's coming to your confession not to
[1:15:46] your thought
[1:15:47] now you can confess it in your mind
[1:15:49] that's fine I'm not saying that but when
[1:15:50] you start confessing Satan's word it's
[1:15:52] like this let's say I get up this

[1:16:29] because I'm late for work
[1:16:31] and I go now I sit on my desk
[1:16:34] what a day
[1:16:37] and someone comes by says watch out man
[1:16:38] this is just a bad day
[1:16:41] it's only 8 35 in the morning I read it
[1:16:43] through the whole day away
[1:16:46] My Confession yeah I expect to be bad
[1:16:48] well plan on it your own confession is
[1:16:51] pretty much going to happen because you
[1:16:52] decided it's going to be a bad day
[1:16:54] you've read it through the rest of the
[1:16:56] day away because you had a rough morning
[1:16:58] but you know what you do as a Believer
[1:16:59] you walk in and you sit down you say all
[1:17:01] right let's get going here someone comes
[1:17:04] up to you man the boss was mad at you
[1:17:06] what's going on oh I had this oh my God
[1:17:08] my wife picked me out of bed I got a
[1:17:09] speeding ticket and all that but this is
[1:17:10] going to be one of the best days of my
[1:17:12] life yeah
[1:17:15] what a difference and you know why that
[1:17:17] person looks at you
[1:17:19] you're weird
[1:17:22] you say I've known that since I was 13.
[1:17:28] it's true
[1:17:29] we're throwing away we take Danville you
[1:17:31] know something bad happens well okay
[1:17:33] there it goes just throw it away
[1:17:36] God's sitting there thinking I will make
[1:17:38] this the best day of your life if you
[1:17:39] would just let me
[1:17:42] and you know what happens when that
[1:17:44] person needs something they come back
[1:17:45] they see something's wrong about that
[1:17:46] brother or that that man or whatever and
[1:17:49] then they have a problem they say hey
[1:17:50] excuse me
[1:17:51] can you pray could you pray for me could
[1:17:54] you have your church pray for me why
[1:17:55] because they saw something real they saw
[1:17:58] something they said how do you get so
[1:17:59] happy after that because I know Jesus
[1:18:01] Christ that's what it is and he makes a
[1:18:03] difference and that and that word goes
[1:18:04] to the office yeah he's kind of weird
[1:18:06] but at least he believes what he says he
[1:18:07] believes
[1:18:10] they see something real
[1:18:13] and it just might be
[1:18:15] that that person sitting over that
[1:18:16] corner of that Cube over the corner
[1:18:18] wherever you worked in that other
[1:18:19] machine they got something inside their
[1:18:21] heart that's looking for satisfaction
[1:18:24] and one time you're walking out of work
[1:18:25] and they kind of come up beside hey can
[1:18:27] I talk to you a minute you seem like you
[1:18:29] really
[1:18:30] well you know what you believe of you
[1:18:32] know being a Christian you seem like you
[1:18:33] got something real can you talk to me
[1:18:35] about that
[1:18:39] it's true friends that's the effect of
[1:18:42] the Holy Spirit through the bride
[1:18:43] shining a light
[1:18:48] mine then it's believed with the heart
[1:18:52] it comes through here friends and if
[1:18:54] those those of those channels are
[1:18:56] blocked off it can't come in and it
[1:18:59] can't come back out
[1:19:00] it's blocked off
[1:19:04] then the word of God becomes a reality
[1:19:06] when it's believed in the heart every
[1:19:07] sense of soul and body just scoured out
[1:19:09] with the Holy Spirit then your sense of
[1:19:11] God your conscience of God everything
[1:19:12] that's Godly flows through you there's
[1:19:14] not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can
[1:19:16] rise up that nothing can come in the
[1:19:18] memory say well I remember Miss Jones
[1:19:19] try to trust God Miss don't try to trust
[1:19:22] God for healing with time and she failed
[1:19:24] but if that channel has been cleared out
[1:19:26] and then purged men filled with the
[1:19:28] inside on the inside of the holy spirit
[1:19:29] that don't even come in memory no matter
[1:19:31] how about Miss Jones she did it's you
[1:19:34] and God together nobody else but you two
[1:19:37] there you are they're your battle
[1:19:40] it's not what happened to your church
[1:19:42] that's not what happened to this person
[1:19:44] it's not what they're doing it's not
[1:19:46] what your mom or your dad or your
[1:19:47] husband your wife or anybody else said
[1:19:49] it's what God said to you and it's
[1:19:51] between you and him and nobody else is
[1:19:54] involved it's an individual walk and
[1:19:56] whatever he says to you that's what you
[1:19:58] believe and everything Satan brings
[1:20:00] against you to counteract that you
[1:20:02] dismiss that and that is your battle
[1:20:06] that is your battle
[1:20:08] brother bran says simple like this he's
[1:20:10] talking to someone I remember I don't
[1:20:12] remember the quote it up it was like
[1:20:13] this he said do you your back's like do
[1:20:15] you want to be back with God yes you're
[1:20:17] back
[1:20:20] wait a minute
[1:20:22] but what about what about what
[1:20:25] what about what Satan what else do you
[1:20:28] want me to try to do I've accepted that
[1:20:30] God done this for me I am no longer
[1:20:32] backslid
[1:20:36] and everything else is Catholicism
[1:20:39] friends
[1:20:41] penance
[1:20:43] there is penance done Jesus done all
[1:20:45] that on the cross
[1:20:47] he's paid for it
[1:20:50] he said kill him at the beginning
[1:20:53] stop him dead in his tracks and then how
[1:20:55] long you make the war linger and stop it
[1:20:57] right now if you'll come you'll keep
[1:20:58] their memories unconscious everything
[1:21:00] well I might fail it might not be right
[1:21:01] don't you do that
[1:21:04] you throw everything aside and open up
[1:21:06] the channel and say God your word is
[1:21:08] eternally true and it's for me if the
[1:21:10] whole church fails if the whole world
[1:21:12] fails yet I cannot fail because I'm
[1:21:16] taking your word the old brother sister
[1:21:18] it's that simple you I don't care if
[1:21:20] you're 10 years old or 100 years old God
[1:21:23] speaks to you and you take his word and
[1:21:25] that's what makes a Believer and the
[1:21:27] gate to hell cannot Prevail against that
[1:21:29] faith if you will hold on to it
[1:21:32] Paul said if you hold your profession to
[1:21:34] the end Stand Fast in what God has said
[1:21:38] let that word grow
[1:21:42] he said what's the matter you have to
[1:21:44] open the Channel first you got to get
[1:21:46] the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at
[1:21:48] the Battlefront to take God's word he
[1:21:49] has a word he stands there there's
[1:21:51] nothing going to stop it then there's
[1:21:53] nothing can every one of the other
[1:21:55] channels is cleared out
[1:21:58] how do you get incurred out you take the
[1:22:00] word against what Satan's saying you say
[1:22:01] but I have this complex that has nothing
[1:22:04] to do with you being a believer foreign
[1:22:07] let me say that again your complex has
[1:22:10] nothing to do with whether or not you're
[1:22:12] a Believer it's just a place where
[1:22:13] Satanist assaults you through
[1:22:16] you get in that gate and that that gate
[1:22:19] has worked you can get people he can get
[1:22:21] through there but when you take that
[1:22:22] gain you get that warp out of it and
[1:22:24] it's got to seal around it and you stand
[1:22:26] there and say it comes against you he
[1:22:28] can still throw that thought in there he
[1:22:30] can throw that in there but you let it
[1:22:31] go by you it's like throwing a snowball
[1:22:33] into hell it might it melts exactly a
[1:22:36] perfectly immediately it's that
[1:22:37] rattlesnake and you don't mess with it
[1:22:39] it's completely gone immediately because
[1:22:40] it can't hurt you if you don't mess with
[1:22:42] that thought
[1:22:47] foreign like an old boil where the flu
[1:22:49] stopped up you put a fire to blow your
[1:22:51] thing up that's a matter of so many
[1:22:53] so-called blowed up Christians they
[1:22:55] don't clean their channels out
[1:22:59] they're hedging their bets
[1:23:01] well I'm gonna go and listen to the
[1:23:03] pastor imma believe what he says you
[1:23:04] know I'm gonna say Amen but
[1:23:07] what if he's a little wrong
[1:23:10] what if this well what if I say that no
[1:23:12] what if what if I go ahead and try to be
[1:23:14] friends with this brother who don't want
[1:23:16] nothing to do with me and he just
[1:23:17] rejects me
[1:23:19] foreign what's that have to do with you
[1:23:23] you're not responsible for his attitude
[1:23:25] you're responsible for your own
[1:23:28] you're the problem not him
[1:23:34] that hurts my feelings
[1:23:37] I like to blame other people
[1:23:42] that's right that's right grow up that's
[1:23:45] what I tell God's saying Phil you need
[1:23:47] to grow up
[1:23:48] take responsibility for yourself stop
[1:23:51] blaming someone else
[1:23:54] yeah
[1:23:57] you got to clean it conscious memory
[1:23:59] thoughts laying aside everything coming
[1:24:01] from the inside out with the
[1:24:02] unadulterated word of God that's the
[1:24:04] truth no matter how ten thousand died on
[1:24:06] this side trusting listen to this if ten
[1:24:08] thousand died on this side today
[1:24:10] trusting ten thousand died on that side
[1:24:12] tomorrow trusting
[1:24:14] trusting
[1:24:16] that has nothing to do with me
[1:24:18] I'm the individual I'm the one that's
[1:24:21] trusting I'm the one that believes it
[1:24:24] brother Branham said a different time he
[1:24:26] said if one person you know one person
[1:24:28] out of your city is going into Rapture
[1:24:29] you have to know it's you
[1:24:31] that's got to be more than just
[1:24:33] something up to hear it's got to come
[1:24:34] from here because you see the word
[1:24:36] manifest through your life and you say
[1:24:38] this is Christ and me he can't take the
[1:24:40] pride without taking me because that's
[1:24:41] Christ
[1:24:43] that's the word
[1:24:46] we see back down and we if we went open
[1:24:48] though and say if we want to open up our
[1:24:50] channels and if we can see we find this
[1:24:52] one and that one this one that one
[1:24:53] thousands of them testifying but the
[1:24:55] devil tried to come right back see if he
[1:24:57] could get in there at all he's got your
[1:25:00] army rather than he's got your senses
[1:25:02] see taste feel smell here they're all
[1:25:04] right but don't trust them unless they
[1:25:05] agree with the word
[1:25:07] imagination conscious memory reason
[1:25:09] affection they're all right if they
[1:25:11] agree with the word but if your
[1:25:12] affection doesn't agree with the word
[1:25:13] get rid of it you both flew right quick
[1:25:20] your affection doesn't agree with the
[1:25:22] word
[1:25:24] let me just get a little bit personal
[1:25:25] for some of you young people
[1:25:27] you're looking for a mate someone to
[1:25:29] marry maybe as you get older if you're
[1:25:31] affection for that person doesn't go
[1:25:33] agree with the word get rid of her
[1:25:36] get rid of him
[1:25:38] if he's not a born-again Christian if
[1:25:40] she's not a born-again Christian you
[1:25:42] have no business even talking to that
[1:25:43] person about anything more than just
[1:25:45] trying to get him to Christ
[1:25:48] because you're going to find that that
[1:25:50] affection gets really strong really
[1:25:51] quick and the next thing you know you're
[1:25:53] having problems
[1:25:57] there's too many people in here can
[1:25:58] testify to that
[1:26:00] we all can we all can
[1:26:07] where am I at here
[1:26:12] here's the thought this is the key to
[1:26:14] the whole thing
[1:26:16] he only can attack you with a thought
[1:26:18] what is a thought
[1:26:19] Define it
[1:26:23] it's I mean can you hold it
[1:26:27] it's like like Brothers It's a seed that
[1:26:29] goes in there but it's just a thought
[1:26:31] it's just an idea it's not even a vapor
[1:26:33] you can't see it floating through the
[1:26:34] air
[1:26:35] it's just an idea that comes into your
[1:26:37] mind that's all he has
[1:26:40] he cannot force you to do anything he
[1:26:43] has no power over you except you accept
[1:26:46] that thought and act on it
[1:26:49] all he can do is stand aside and hurl
[1:26:51] thoughts into once you you possess that
[1:26:53] gate he can just throw thoughts in there
[1:26:54] and all you do is you just ignore him
[1:26:58] or if it's a strong something it's
[1:27:00] unlike like a a a addiction or something
[1:27:03] you take the word against that and you
[1:27:04] withstand that thought that's all he's
[1:27:06] got
[1:27:07] he can't make you do anything and yet we
[1:27:10] walk around like oh Satan's really got
[1:27:12] me going he's got me depressed he's got
[1:27:13] me down I'm sure having a bad day
[1:27:17] well yeah you are you accepted his
[1:27:19] thoughts
[1:27:22] I'm not saying to be some kind of
[1:27:24] Pollyanna oh everything's fine I never
[1:27:25] have a hard time of course you do
[1:27:27] friends everybody has hard times but
[1:27:29] what's your attitude going through that
[1:27:31] hard time because that's when you're
[1:27:32] molding your character because friends
[1:27:34] as long as you still take a do you know
[1:27:36] how attitude well I'm just going to get
[1:27:37] over here and pout and I'm gonna talk to
[1:27:39] them anymore you're not growing up very
[1:27:40] fast he gives you those things to go
[1:27:42] through to materials to bring us to a
[1:27:44] place where he can trust us with his
[1:27:46] word
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:48] the authority of the word is incredible
[1:27:50] he's trying to get us to that point this
[1:27:52] these thoughts are not even a substance
[1:27:54] they're just something that it says like
[1:27:56] brothers said it's a seed but if you
[1:27:58] don't accept that seed it's not going to
[1:28:00] grow it's going to land use weed that
[1:28:01] thing out and let it go it's going to
[1:28:03] die
[1:28:07] they're only as powerful as we allow
[1:28:09] them to be
[1:28:11] Satan tells us something
[1:28:16] if you don't speak it
[1:28:17] and you just let it go
[1:28:20] powerless
[1:28:22] powerless
[1:28:25] say it again and again if you don't
[1:28:26] accept that thought it's powerless
[1:28:30] but when we have an addiction or we have
[1:28:32] a complex or something where he has a
[1:28:33] strong hold in there and we allow that
[1:28:36] to come in there then it becomes
[1:28:37] powerful that's what we need friends we
[1:28:39] need to get rid of those addictions we
[1:28:40] need to get rid of those strongholds we
[1:28:42] need to give those complexity because
[1:28:43] that's where he has access into our
[1:28:45] spirit realm and he makes health for us
[1:28:47] there
[1:28:49] that's right
[1:28:50] God wants to be free
[1:28:54] so how to go about possessing this am I
[1:28:56] about all the time let me let me take a
[1:28:58] few more minutes
[1:28:59] thank you
[1:29:01] this was quoted earlier for God hath not
[1:29:04] given us a spirit of fear but of power
[1:29:06] and of love and his sound mind
[1:29:09] that's a scripture God gave me years ago
[1:29:12] personally
[1:29:14] because I struggled with fear my whole
[1:29:16] life ever since I was a five-year-old
[1:29:18] kid
[1:29:19] I still do
[1:29:21] and I'm still free
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:25] he didn't give you a spirit of fear
[1:29:28] he gave you a spirit of power
[1:29:32] to overcome that to what is that power I
[1:29:34] might cast out Devils just start with
[1:29:36] his thoughts
[1:29:38] don't worry about casting demons out of
[1:29:39] someone else start with his thoughts in
[1:29:41] your own mind cast those out he gave the
[1:29:43] spirit of love
[1:29:45] because love casts out fear
[1:29:47] and a sound mind that means he'd give
[1:29:50] you a spirit to get rid of all those
[1:29:51] complexes and all that junk going on in
[1:29:53] there
[1:29:56] President says this I find out one of
[1:29:58] the greatest hindrances that the church
[1:29:59] has got today is they're scared to death
[1:30:03] and what are you scared of
[1:30:06] that's what I'm wondering he said what
[1:30:08] are you scared about that's what I'm
[1:30:10] wondering if you'll just only realize
[1:30:12] who you are
[1:30:14] you don't know who you are you don't
[1:30:16] know who is sitting next to you oh my
[1:30:18] this is good
[1:30:20] you say that's my neighbor I know him
[1:30:23] all right but he's a Son of God adopted
[1:30:25] by Jesus Christ into the family that's a
[1:30:27] daughter God's sitting next to you and
[1:30:28] who are you you are a Christian believer
[1:30:31] you're a son or daughter of God why are
[1:30:33] you scared about no need to be scared
[1:30:36] there's nothing to be afraid of if you
[1:30:39] realize who you are that's why he's
[1:30:41] constantly telling you you're the bride
[1:30:42] of Christ you're the bride of Christ
[1:30:44] look at the evidence look at the
[1:30:46] evidence that God living and you
[1:30:48] changing you making it to what you're
[1:30:49] supposed to be that's the Christ to this
[1:30:51] day that's the light of this world and
[1:30:53] then Satan comes along and get us some
[1:30:55] thought of fear and we latch on to that
[1:30:57] fear
[1:30:59] we forget Who We Are
[1:31:01] because he has so much evidence to back
[1:31:03] it up he gives all this evidence against
[1:31:05] you he gets thought thought and then he
[1:31:07] drops that in yeah but what if it's not
[1:31:08] really you you know if the Rapture went
[1:31:10] today you'd be in a bad place wouldn't
[1:31:11] you
[1:31:13] not near as bad as you Satan
[1:31:21] he said no need to be in
[1:31:24] being devil can keep you scared that's
[1:31:25] all he wants to do he's got you right
[1:31:28] then
[1:31:30] friends he's got you when he has you
[1:31:32] scared that's all he has to do and as
[1:31:34] all the thoughts up here
[1:31:37] that bull came out brother Brown he
[1:31:40] changed his sons the Holy Spirit came he
[1:31:42] and love was projected and that bull
[1:31:44] went away friends when that said when
[1:31:46] those Devils come against you and that
[1:31:48] fun and that a dictionary thing if you
[1:31:50] would just focus y'all your your belief
[1:31:52] on God and hold on to that what he's
[1:31:55] revealed to you friends without thinking
[1:31:56] what could die and go away
[1:31:59] but here's what you have to do you have
[1:32:01] to Just Surrender it to God it's like
[1:32:03] God take this from me take this
[1:32:04] besetting sin take this away and believe
[1:32:06] he's going to do it and here's here's
[1:32:08] the problem this is where we had your
[1:32:09] best friend is because they take it away
[1:32:11] from me take it away from me but you you
[1:32:12] know I'll probably probably won't
[1:32:16] how many times you've prayed about that
[1:32:17] thing how many times have you come up in
[1:32:19] your pastor prayed about that thing how
[1:32:21] many times you've gone to God about that
[1:32:22] thing and yet you still struggle with it
[1:32:24] and what happens is I prayed and prayed
[1:32:26] God but I still struggle
[1:32:29] well how are you supposed to believe
[1:32:31] God
[1:32:33] when she has all that evidence against
[1:32:34] you
[1:32:43] who are you
[1:32:46] you can take Satan's evidence against
[1:32:48] that and say you know you're right I
[1:32:49] probably never overcome this I sure
[1:32:50] struggle with it God's gonna have to
[1:32:52] come down and just really smite me or do
[1:32:53] something
[1:32:55] no
[1:32:57] no you just start believing What God
[1:32:59] Says
[1:33:01] and you get to the point where you want
[1:33:02] to be set free you will surrender that
[1:33:04] thing to God without holding on to it
[1:33:08] you will
[1:33:10] God will bring it to that point
[1:33:13] and you'll surrender and you'll mean it
[1:33:15] and you'll know you will know I'm
[1:33:17] speaking from experience you will know
[1:33:18] when you really surrender that thing or
[1:33:19] not because when you don't you pray God
[1:33:21] I really don't want this I really don't
[1:33:22] want this but you're still holding on to
[1:33:23] part of it
[1:33:26] this is a personal thing
[1:33:31] when Jesus rose up he said fear not I am
[1:33:33] he that was dead in his life forevermore
[1:33:34] had the keys of death and hell he has
[1:33:36] the keys to your gate friends he already
[1:33:38] has it he said there's one of the
[1:33:40] greatest interesters in the church today
[1:33:42] among other people everywhere is fear
[1:33:45] love perfect love casteth out fear the
[1:33:48] reason you're fearful is going to hurt
[1:33:50] your feelings
[1:33:52] the reason you're fearful is because the
[1:33:54] right Temperance of love has never
[1:33:56] entered yet
[1:34:00] it's a lack of maturity friends
[1:34:03] we're still green we're still Junior
[1:34:05] High kids
[1:34:07] nothing against Junior High kids
[1:34:09] the one-year-old you know serving God
[1:34:11] you got to get past that
[1:34:13] when there's real love all fear passes
[1:34:16] away when you really love the Lord
[1:34:19] he says I'm not condemning you
[1:34:22] I'm only trying to bring something to
[1:34:23] life that you could look at
[1:34:27] he's not condemning us
[1:34:29] he said it's finished to be in the
[1:34:30] Christian church today that the greatest
[1:34:31] hindrance the Christian church has is
[1:34:33] fear
[1:34:34] just a Triad Christianity is not a trial
[1:34:38] it's a no-so it's something that is real
[1:34:40] you're not going to just try well I'm
[1:34:42] gonna try to overcome this I'm gonna try
[1:34:44] to pray through them no it's something
[1:34:45] that God has revealed to you it's a
[1:34:47] no-so and you just take God's word about
[1:34:49] that no matter what Satan comes against
[1:34:50] you you struggle with this for your
[1:34:52] whole life you've had this problem
[1:34:53] you've had that problem and yet you know
[1:34:55] the word of God and you claim the word
[1:34:56] of God over that thing and every time
[1:34:58] you fall to it you you claim the word of
[1:35:00] God until you quit falling to it
[1:35:02] there is Deliverance friend I'm not
[1:35:04] saying that oh you're going to have it
[1:35:05] for a long time you have these problems
[1:35:06] you're gonna fight these for a long time
[1:35:08] and you're going to have struggle with
[1:35:09] these things but their deliverance and
[1:35:11] even when that still is a weakness
[1:35:12] brother and sister you still are
[1:35:14] overcomer
[1:35:19] I'm gonna tell you something you might
[1:35:21] like to hear this
[1:35:23] about your profit
[1:35:25] your Prophet had a complex remember
[1:35:28] he said I developed a complex why
[1:35:30] because he said the people
[1:35:33] we're rejecting what I was saying
[1:35:37] he said I was going to go up into the
[1:35:39] Northwoods Canada Alaska and be a
[1:35:40] Trapper a God and then when God gave me
[1:35:43] a message to come back and say go back
[1:35:44] up there what's he trying to do escape
[1:35:46] from the people where did that come from
[1:35:47] as a kid
[1:35:50] he had been rejected nothing he did
[1:35:52] wrong but his name he had a bad name so
[1:35:54] no one wanted to be his friend
[1:35:57] he had a complex built up and when it
[1:35:59] happened all these years through this
[1:36:00] his ministry Satan was constantly
[1:36:02] hitting with that remember he said he
[1:36:04] walked through the parking lot one
[1:36:05] morning he saw all the license plates
[1:36:06] for all the different places people had
[1:36:08] come for he said now Satan if it's true
[1:36:10] nobody likes me why are all these people
[1:36:12] here
[1:36:14] he was finding a complex that God had
[1:36:16] that God had a lot to get into his mind
[1:36:18] as a very young kid when he was rejected
[1:36:20] for being a Branham
[1:36:24] and when he got older and the people
[1:36:27] were rejecting him what did he do
[1:36:29] he did this
[1:36:31] he did the same thing Samuel did when he
[1:36:33] was rejected he took it personal
[1:36:38] remember they wanted to claimer we want
[1:36:40] a king Simon was all tore up God said
[1:36:42] they didn't reject you Sam what they're
[1:36:43] rejecting me but Santa took it personal
[1:36:45] and when the people rejected brother
[1:36:47] Brown's message he took a personal
[1:36:52] in his mind and he's trying to have a
[1:36:55] feeling towards the people he said I
[1:36:57] lost my feeling towards the people
[1:37:01] I don't like hearing that about the
[1:37:02] prophet let him be a human being
[1:37:05] aren't you glad he had mistakes aren't
[1:37:07] you glad he was human what if he lived
[1:37:09] as Flawless and infallible as a lot of
[1:37:10] message Believers think he was where
[1:37:12] would that put you and I
[1:37:18] it's true friends
[1:37:21] this is who he was and then what did he
[1:37:23] say he preached he got on he told us all
[1:37:25] that right
[1:37:27] and after he said he said God said if
[1:37:29] you follow that your plan you're going
[1:37:31] to lose everything including your wife
[1:37:35] and he had learned obedience when he
[1:37:37] lost his first wife
[1:37:41] and yet
[1:37:43] what did he say then he said
[1:37:45] and I still have that feeling towards
[1:37:49] the people I still don't feel right
[1:37:51] towards the people
[1:37:54] so just because you know something is
[1:37:57] wrong doesn't mean that that
[1:37:59] complex or that stronghold is gone
[1:38:02] it's still there he said I need God to
[1:38:05] do something to get me back where I had
[1:38:07] that right feeling towards the people
[1:38:09] yeah it takes the supernatural work when
[1:38:10] there's a stronghold it takes God to do
[1:38:12] something like that he said pray for me
[1:38:15] that God will do this for me
[1:38:18] he did
[1:38:21] so every one of us probably this morning
[1:38:23] I hope God if you don't have any
[1:38:25] strongholds or complexes God bless you
[1:38:27] you're wonderful
[1:38:28] praise God
[1:38:30] but if you do friends
[1:38:33] God wants to set you free
[1:38:36] he wants to give you his word and he
[1:38:38] might give you the word that is going to
[1:38:40] take a week or two weeks or a year to
[1:38:42] get rid of it he might want to do it
[1:38:43] this morning I don't know and maybe you
[1:38:45] don't know but all he wants you to do is
[1:38:47] when that word comes he wants you to
[1:38:48] grab a hold of it and he speaks to you
[1:38:50] personally say that's for me
[1:38:52] that's all he asks you to do believe his
[1:38:54] word but Father Phil I prayed and prayed
[1:38:57] about this that's doubt
[1:39:00] when you had that excuse I prayed and
[1:39:03] prayed you're listening to Satan's doubt
[1:39:06] it's all it is
[1:39:08] and it extinguishes the faith God throws
[1:39:10] that word there believe what I'm telling
[1:39:12] you this morning he said I tried to
[1:39:13] believe before
[1:39:15] you can be free this morning I thought
[1:39:18] it was free before
[1:39:24] and with that attitude friends you will
[1:39:27] never be free
[1:39:30] because you're always giving credibility
[1:39:32] you're still believing Satan's gospel
[1:39:34] over God's gospel
[1:39:37] that's all addiction is Satan says I can
[1:39:40] make you happier than God
[1:39:42] follow this addiction
[1:39:44] follow this Addiction coming out like
[1:39:46] people think drugs friends there is
[1:39:48] addiction to Greed money power lust
[1:39:51] religion
[1:39:53] there's thousands of addictions to your
[1:39:55] own self there's lots of addictions
[1:39:58] the internet provides plenty
[1:40:03] brother said TV
[1:40:06] cell phones oh boy
[1:40:08] everyone runs to the altar yes I'm
[1:40:10] addicted to my cell phone
[1:40:15] dealt with kids was suicidal because
[1:40:17] their mom took their cell phone away
[1:40:20] this is real friend
[1:40:23] brother man said each age had this
[1:40:25] pressures for example a great burden of
[1:40:26] this last stage is a pressure of riches
[1:40:28] soft-living and nervous tension in a
[1:40:31] complex age we seem unfitted to live in
[1:40:34] he said that back in the 1960s what
[1:40:37] would he say today
[1:40:40] he's preaching he said how many of you
[1:40:41] are bound through the pressure of the
[1:40:43] enemy raise your hand if you feel the
[1:40:44] pressure enemy and your Abraham's seed
[1:40:47] he said raise your hand like this say
[1:40:49] brother Brandon I'm bothered with the
[1:40:50] nervousness he said oh there's about 80
[1:40:51] of you with that
[1:40:53] in 1964.
[1:40:56] nervous
[1:40:58] tension
[1:41:00] that's Hearts failing for fear
[1:41:03] you see it all around you see people
[1:41:04] running to getting all kinds of
[1:41:06] medication and everything to drive deal
[1:41:07] with the stress that we're under
[1:41:12] let me go back to Second Corinthians
[1:41:13] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:41:15] walk with war after the flesh friends
[1:41:16] you cannot take to say well I'm going to
[1:41:18] do that I'm going to do it brother Phil
[1:41:19] I'm going to do it I'm going to reduce
[1:41:20] no you're not
[1:41:22] no you're not
[1:41:24] you're going to go to God and say God
[1:41:27] you promised this
[1:41:29] because you might go out of here and
[1:41:30] every time Satan throws a thought in
[1:41:32] your mind the rest of the day you get
[1:41:34] rid of it
[1:41:36] tomorrow morning
[1:41:38] you're weaker
[1:41:40] by tomorrow night
[1:41:42] your your complex is
[1:41:45] stronger than ever that stronghold
[1:41:46] stronger because you tried in your own
[1:41:48] ability to overcome
[1:41:50] you can't overcome Satan in your own
[1:41:53] thoughts he's been doing this for
[1:41:54] thousands of years
[1:41:56] he knows how to attack you he knows how
[1:41:58] to set up the situation where you're not
[1:42:00] going to be he said well you say I have
[1:42:01] to believe you do disbelievable but you
[1:42:03] also recognize it's the Holy Spirit
[1:42:05] you're taking God's word against the
[1:42:06] Holy Spirit has to do this friends
[1:42:08] you have to allow him to do it by
[1:42:10] believing in God's word
[1:42:13] you're not going to overcome Satan with
[1:42:15] your own ability
[1:42:17] he's going to try to get you to he's
[1:42:19] going to say you know what just try
[1:42:20] harder brother you just got to be more
[1:42:22] dedicated be more sincere you just got
[1:42:24] to pray more you just
[1:42:27] try it
[1:42:30] you find yourself defeated
[1:42:35] your own ability
[1:42:36] won't get you anywhere it's the holy
[1:42:38] spirit in you but when you recognize the
[1:42:40] holy spirit is in you you bring that
[1:42:42] Soldier say God I'm struggling with
[1:42:43] these thoughts right now I believe what
[1:42:45] you said I need you to come and take
[1:42:46] care of this
[1:42:47] and I can tell you from experience that
[1:42:49] Holy Spirit will never say throw that
[1:42:51] away get rid of that get rid of that and
[1:42:53] it will work
[1:42:55] and the way he deals with me on this is
[1:42:57] different than the way he deals with you
[1:42:58] and the way he deals with you and you
[1:43:00] and you because he deals everyone
[1:43:01] different with this because we're all
[1:43:02] individuals so you had to find out what
[1:43:04] works for you and how you're supposed to
[1:43:06] walk your own relationship with Christ
[1:43:08] for weapons of a Warfare are not carnal
[1:43:10] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[1:43:12] down on the strongholds casting down
[1:43:14] imagination and every High thing that
[1:43:16] exalted this out against the notch of
[1:43:17] God bringing into captivity every
[1:43:20] thought to The Obedience of Christ the
[1:43:22] Bible says you can bring into captivity
[1:43:24] every thought
[1:43:26] that means you can get rid of your
[1:43:28] complexes your fears your doubts you can
[1:43:30] get rid of all this and bring it all
[1:43:31] into captivity to The Obedience of
[1:43:34] Christ
[1:43:35] he said well well that's the way it is
[1:43:37] why don't God just do it right away why
[1:43:38] don't he just come and just get rid of
[1:43:39] all this stuff for me because this is
[1:43:41] what you have to overcome he's not going
[1:43:43] to let you just walk into this
[1:43:46] look friends when you're when you're flu
[1:43:48] when your gates are all in your
[1:43:50] possession you're standing there and you
[1:43:51] possess those days
[1:43:54] the the how do I say this your
[1:43:57] omnipotence is right there at hand
[1:43:59] there's nothing to hinder your faith you
[1:44:01] can do anything you want
[1:44:04] you have unlimited power at your
[1:44:07] fingertips
[1:44:09] because there's nothing to bring doubt
[1:44:12] and if he does that brother Graham said
[1:44:15] power without character is satanic and
[1:44:17] he just gave us that before we have to
[1:44:19] carry to handle it we've been doing all
[1:44:21] kinds of terrible stuff we've been doing
[1:44:24] all kinds of things with the power of
[1:44:25] God
[1:44:27] you see people out there they work this
[1:44:29] you see like the the prosperity gospels
[1:44:31] and all that and they work this to an
[1:44:33] extent but brother sister we got as a
[1:44:35] bride of Christ we had the very word a
[1:44:37] very creative work in our fingertips
[1:44:39] it's on our heart and what we speak God
[1:44:42] will bring it to pass we have the saith
[1:44:44] the Lord
[1:44:46] or we keep still and here's why we keep
[1:44:50] still without it because we are the
[1:44:51] character to only do what he asks us to
[1:44:54] do we had the same testimony Jesus said
[1:44:56] I always do that which pleases the
[1:44:58] father
[1:45:00] and that's why sometime it takes a while
[1:45:02] to take God allows these things to go on
[1:45:04] because he's more than our character so
[1:45:06] that when he does clear that out and all
[1:45:08] your gates are completely in possession
[1:45:12] he says now whatever you say I'm going
[1:45:14] to bring it to pass
[1:45:16] that's our that's what we get friends
[1:45:19] that's what it means to be a bride in
[1:45:21] this age that's why we had the pure work
[1:45:23] is to affect that and abide because we
[1:45:25] had to have rapturing faith
[1:45:28] that's greater Faith than ever ever
[1:45:30] before
[1:45:33] this is Who We Are
[1:45:35] this is what God is doing for us
[1:45:39] he said God's provided place of safety
[1:45:41] God said the name of the Lord is the
[1:45:43] mighty tower the righteous run into
[1:45:44] Twitter safe as the time is in a time of
[1:45:46] sickness when sickness strikes the
[1:45:47] doctor says there's nothing I can do
[1:45:48] about it don't build up pressure let off
[1:45:51] the pressure call your pastor let him
[1:45:53] anoint you in oil and pray over you pray
[1:45:55] your face shall save the sick run off
[1:45:56] the pressure Satan says oh you got
[1:45:59] cancer you're gonna die you take the
[1:46:00] word says well if God wants me to die
[1:46:03] I'll die but if it's not his will I
[1:46:04] won't die and Satan you have nothing to
[1:46:06] say about it
[1:46:09] what do you do you go to God you find
[1:46:11] out what's his perfect will he says see
[1:46:13] to he says by my struts you're healed
[1:46:16] you're healed and you walk out of there
[1:46:17] and you tell everyone in the world I'm
[1:46:19] Healed and you're laying on your
[1:46:21] deathbed you take three more breaths and
[1:46:22] you're gonna be die and they say you
[1:46:23] have anything like to say I'm still
[1:46:25] healed
[1:46:28] because God said so
[1:46:31] careless Satan says that's just the
[1:46:33] atmosphere to see if you're gonna
[1:46:34] believe or not
[1:46:37] oh my let the pressure off quit
[1:46:39] listening to Satan's sauce that's what
[1:46:41] bring the pressure God never told you
[1:46:43] let me finish with this God never told
[1:46:44] you you need to worry
[1:46:47] the Holy Spirit never tells you you need
[1:46:49] to stop worrying about this you better
[1:46:51] start worrying you better be fearful he
[1:46:53] never did that and he spared that comes
[1:46:55] to you says that is a liar it's a Satan
[1:46:57] spirit and said that was trying to get
[1:46:59] you to lose your faith
[1:47:01] that's all it is
[1:47:05] I think I'm done friends praise the Lord
[1:47:08] yeah
[1:47:13] there's a sister for you
[1:47:27] you just said what other people were
[1:47:29] thinking
[1:47:33] thank you
[1:47:37] Jeremiah in 29 says
[1:47:40] for I know the thoughts that I think
[1:47:42] towards you saith the Lord
[1:47:44] lots of peace and not of evil
[1:47:48] to give you an expected end
[1:47:51] those are the thoughts God has for you
[1:47:53] anything against that is a lie
[1:47:55] well God's going to make you suffer this
[1:47:57] God's make it yeah you're going to
[1:47:58] suffer you're going to have tests you're
[1:48:00] gonna have trials
[1:48:02] but he has good thoughts towards us he's
[1:48:05] going to use that he's going to use
[1:48:06] those trials he's going to use all that
[1:48:07] to bring you to an expected end
[1:48:10] there's a purpose he's not the author of
[1:48:11] confusion he doesn't just throw trials
[1:48:14] out there just to have you suffer
[1:48:17] he says I have expectation for you
[1:48:19] I have something for you
[1:48:21] go ahead and Stan
[1:48:24] I'll read another quote here that was
[1:48:25] read earlier someone mentioned it
[1:48:27] finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[1:48:29] true what certain things are honest
[1:48:31] whatever is just pure horrible
[1:48:35] things of good report if there have been
[1:48:37] a virtue if there'd be any praise
[1:48:39] think on these things
[1:48:42] Satan can fill our mind with all kinds
[1:48:44] of junk
[1:48:45] sin could fill our mind with all kinds
[1:48:47] of fears and doubts
[1:48:49] things of the world
[1:48:51] some of you say well there's nothing
[1:48:53] wrong with it I'm not saying it's always
[1:48:55] wrong brother brother sister it's not
[1:48:57] always wrong
[1:48:59] but does it take your mind does it
[1:49:01] interfere with your relationship with
[1:49:02] Christ
[1:49:04] because that can be just as bad because
[1:49:06] you think it's okay
[1:49:08] and for one one person maybe what I'm
[1:49:10] doing is okay with me and another person
[1:49:12] for them to do it would be an idol
[1:49:14] because it's an individual thing it's an
[1:49:16] individual walk just you and God you
[1:49:18] can't look at someone else and judge
[1:49:19] yourself
[1:49:20] by how this person's serving God or how
[1:49:22] that person's serving God or what this
[1:49:24] person allows or that person allows
[1:49:27] it's your own walk
[1:49:30] and when you're honest with yourself
[1:49:33] which is hard to do sometime
[1:49:36] you know what's interfering with you and
[1:49:38] God
[1:49:39] between
[1:49:42] well I'm just playing basketball but
[1:49:43] Phil
[1:49:45] there's nothing wrong with playing
[1:49:46] basketball I used to love to play
[1:49:47] basketball
[1:49:50] unless it's interfering with the time
[1:49:51] you should be praying
[1:49:57] it's just the way it is friends you have
[1:49:59] to this is your walk personal walk
[1:50:02] this is just you and him
[1:50:04] but he's called you to this he didn't
[1:50:06] come this morning to condemn you
[1:50:08] he didn't come this morning to beat you
[1:50:10] down and say well you're just weak
[1:50:11] you're just a kid you're not mature he
[1:50:13] didn't come to do that but at all he
[1:50:16] come to tell you that you are his and he
[1:50:17] wants to set you free and all he's
[1:50:19] asking you to do is believe what he has
[1:50:20] for you to believe
[1:50:23] that person standing beside you
[1:50:27] they're a part of the body of Christ
[1:50:29] they're a child of God
[1:50:31] they have faith to believe
[1:50:34] you have faith to believe
[1:50:36] Satan likes to get in in our midst and
[1:50:38] and cause division get me thinking this
[1:50:41] about that person that sister about that
[1:50:43] person anything to call it division
[1:50:44] because then you have Strife you have
[1:50:46] all this this problems in the church but
[1:50:48] when you're in unity
[1:50:51] he has nothing to fight through
[1:50:53] brother Brandon said when someone comes
[1:50:55] into your church and starts causing
[1:50:56] problems don't take sides with them just
[1:50:58] love each other all that much more
[1:51:01] because Satan is easy to point out all
[1:51:02] the problems all the weaknesses we have
[1:51:06] when someone comes and says well you
[1:51:08] know this brother here you know I saw
[1:51:09] him get down at Walmart the other day
[1:51:12] you should have seen what he was doing
[1:51:16] I don't care what he was doing
[1:51:19] he's my brother in Christ
[1:51:21] if I need to pray for him I'll pray for
[1:51:22] him
[1:51:23] besides that don't expect
[1:51:25] you to throw a division between us I'm
[1:51:27] like oh my god you're kidding he did
[1:51:29] that
[1:51:30] that's just Satan
[1:51:39] there you stand this morning there
[1:51:41] stands the Church of the Living God I
[1:51:43] don't care what anyone else says what
[1:51:44] the doctor says what anything what the
[1:51:45] unbeliever says we're more than a match
[1:51:47] for anything that comes along
[1:51:50] do you believe that
[1:51:51] this body of Christ you're more than a
[1:51:54] match because individuals in it have a
[1:51:56] relationship with Christ you're not more
[1:51:58] than a match as a body with everyone
[1:52:00] just kind of joining the church
[1:52:02] but when you as an individual have your
[1:52:04] own relationship with Christ then you
[1:52:06] put that person with that person and
[1:52:07] that person you're more than a match for
[1:52:09] anything Satan throws against you
[1:52:13] we are Abraham's seed and we shall
[1:52:15] posestigate our enemy no matter what the
[1:52:16] enemy is God gave the promise that was
[1:52:18] theirs their possession healing is your
[1:52:21] possession salvation is our possession
[1:52:23] the Holy Ghost is your possession
[1:52:24] there's
[1:52:26] great thousands of preachers and so
[1:52:28] forth and glad today that says that's
[1:52:29] not so
[1:52:30] there's plenty of people say the message
[1:52:32] isn't true there are plenty of people
[1:52:33] say that word called there's plenty of
[1:52:34] people saying that we are completely
[1:52:36] deceived
[1:52:39] are you
[1:52:42] that's your own your testimony you and
[1:52:44] God your reason United to see you know
[1:52:46] you're not deceived because of Jesus
[1:52:48] Christ is revealed to you who you are
[1:52:50] otherwise you might be
[1:52:53] he said the way that the Seed of Abraham
[1:52:55] knows it so they Wade right in and
[1:52:58] possessed the gate to the enemy
[1:53:00] weighed right in and possess it go
[1:53:02] forward draw your sword and go fight
[1:53:03] start cutting up the devil just take
[1:53:05] God's word and go for what you have need
[1:53:06] of
[1:53:07] God said they would they believe it
[1:53:09] because it's a promise his seed shall
[1:53:11] possess the gates of the enemy then he
[1:53:13] says now you'll go to testings and
[1:53:15] trials
[1:53:21] you're testing at trials is to prove who
[1:53:23] you are friends
[1:53:26] if you don't have any tests to try to
[1:53:27] overcome you won't know who you are you
[1:53:30] wouldn't know what God has has planned
[1:53:32] for you wouldn't know who what what God
[1:53:34] wants to do to your life and so through
[1:53:35] the testing and trial you realize who
[1:53:37] you are
[1:53:39] and it gives you greater faith the
[1:53:41] brother earlier he went through a
[1:53:42] horrible hard test and look at what
[1:53:44] faith he's up here just testimony
[1:53:46] testifying and just having a big time
[1:53:48] the test is the greatest thing friends
[1:53:52] is that all right
[1:53:54] amen let's pray
[1:53:57] brother sister God got put on my heart
[1:53:59] to come and speak this and he put on my
[1:54:02] heart that he wants to set someone free
[1:54:03] this morning I'll just tell you what I
[1:54:05] don't know who it is I don't know what
[1:54:06] it is but he wants someone to take a
[1:54:08] hold of this word and be set free
[1:54:10] if you are that person then reach out
[1:54:12] you could come in the front we'll pray
[1:54:14] with you if you want to just reach out
[1:54:15] whatever God leads you to do

[1:54:32] reach out on faith and grasp a hold of
[1:54:33] it it becomes yours
[1:54:35] there's a time when you can reach out
[1:54:37] and say I believe it right now and that
[1:54:38] word is quickened to you and this is
[1:54:40] your day of Deliverance this is your day
[1:54:42] of healing this is your day when you can
[1:54:44] walk out of here completely free from
[1:54:45] that thing
