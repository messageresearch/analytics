[31:43] and if we'll just go in the Psalms to
[31:45] Psalms 143
[31:57] .
[32:06] Psalms 143
[32:09] hear my prayer oh Lord give ear to my
[32:11] supplication
[32:14] in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy
[32:16] righteousness
[32:25] for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he
[32:27] has smitten my life down to the ground
[32:29] he hath made me dwell in darkness as
[32:31] those that have been long dead
[32:34] foreign
[32:42] I remember the days of old I meditate on
[32:44] all thy works I Muse on the work of thy
[32:47] hands
[32:55] Hear Me speedingly O Lord my spirit
[32:57] faileth High not by
[33:01] face from me lest Debbie like unto them
[33:04] that go down into the pit
[33:17] Deliver Me O Lord from mine enemies I
[33:20] flee unto thee to hide me
[33:31] Quicken Me O Lord for thy name's sake
[33:34] for thy righteousness sake bring my soul
[33:36] out of trouble
[33:38] and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies
[33:41] and destroy all them that afflict my
[33:43] soul for I am thy servant God bless you
[33:46] may be seated brother Brian
[33:49] foreign
[34:01] brothers and sisters
[34:04] that second verse of that Psalm there
[34:07] and are not into judgment with thy
[34:09] servant for in their sight shall no
[34:11] living man be justified and without
[34:13] Christ this morning we'd be in trouble
[34:15] this morning you would turn to uh
[34:19] oh I mark my place right Deuteronomy the
[34:22] 15th chapter you know there was a quote
[34:25] up there about Victory Day and I was
[34:27] just thinking this morning
[34:29] you know
[34:31] how many I can only speak for myself I
[34:34] say that a lot but how many times have
[34:36] you been up on top of the mountain
[34:38] everything is going good the birds are
[34:41] singing everything is perfect
[34:43] and you think it's going to be like that
[34:45] forever and then all of a sudden in
[34:47] Split Second you go from that mountain
[34:50] all the way down to the lowest Valley
[34:52] but in it all you know that God's got
[34:55] you by your by your hands he's holding
[34:57] you through the
[34:59] circumstances and I've always found in
[35:01] my life when
[35:03] things are going the greatest they're
[35:05] going the best you think you're doing
[35:07] great all of a sudden the next second
[35:09] something major happens something crazy
[35:11] happens and you realize that you can't
[35:15] trust in anything that you see or
[35:17] anything you feel the only thing you can
[35:19] trust in is the word of God and I was
[35:22] thinking this morning as I was praying I
[35:25] uh every every morning I used to go to
[35:28] work early in the morning and I I used
[35:30] to listen to brother cook on the radio
[35:33] and uh he would always talk about uh
[35:36] Expo I'm not going to pay the way he
[35:38] preached he would take a scripture and a
[35:40] scripture in the scripture and I was
[35:42] laughing because I realized why he would
[35:45] do that because
[35:46] you know sometimes some ministers they
[35:49] know that the only word people are
[35:52] here that day
[35:54] out of the box some
[35:57] people just will not read their Bible
[35:59] won't study
[36:01] the Assembly of God I'm hoping there's
[36:04] no one here like that this morning
[36:06] but I was reading here in
[36:09] Deuteronomy here this morning and
[36:12] brother Brandon I'm talking many
[36:13] messages out at the end of it but I was
[36:16] just thinking about a different subject
[36:17] out of it
[36:19] you it um I'll just read here and at the
[36:23] end of every seven years this is the
[36:25] 15th chapter of Deuteronomy
[36:28] and I do that old devotional that I'm
[36:31] sure everyone has but I I just can't
[36:33] read one chapter so I wind up being
[36:35] chapters ahead most of the time and then
[36:37] having to go back but I'm that many
[36:39] chapters ahead and I was reading in here
[36:41] and it said at the end of every seven
[36:44] years that I shall make a release this
[36:46] goes to if
[36:48] if um if your brother in in the Israeli
[36:52] day if your brother loans you money on
[36:55] the seventh year you were if he didn't
[36:57] pay that debt completely off you were
[36:59] supposed to forgive him of that debt but
[37:01] I'll just read what it says at the end
[37:03] of every seven years it also make a
[37:05] release and this is the manner of the
[37:08] release every creditor that lenteth
[37:10] ought on to his neighbor so release it
[37:13] too bad the banks weren't like that
[37:15] today and it's all not exactly his
[37:17] neighbor or of his brother because it is
[37:19] called the Lord's release so he's
[37:22] telling
[37:23] Moses through the Lord is telling the
[37:26] people that if you own your brothers
[37:27] anything after seven years you're
[37:30] supposed to release it or at the form of
[37:33] thou Mouse exactly again so he's saying
[37:36] if it's a foreigner you loan it to or do
[37:38] something for he's liable for the debt
[37:40] but that which is thine with thy brother
[37:43] thine hand shall release
[37:45] say when there be no poor say one there
[37:48] be no poor among you for the Lord shall
[37:50] greatly blessedly in the lamb which the
[37:53] Lord thy God giveth thee for an
[37:54] inheritance to possess it
[37:56] so God promised the children of Israel
[37:58] that he would Prosper them so much
[38:01] that that there wouldn't be any prob
[38:04] poverty in the land he goes on to say
[38:06] here
[38:08] only if thou carefully hearken and then
[38:11] there's a caveat to this there always is
[38:13] as long as you do what God told you to
[38:16] do this those things will happen there's
[38:19] there's always the carrot and the stick
[38:21] with in the Old Testament you either
[38:24] take the turret or
[38:25] there you go and again you have to stay
[38:28] I miss
[38:29] say when there shall be no poor among
[38:32] you for the Lord shall greatly bless
[38:34] thee in the Lamb with the Lord thy God
[38:35] giveth thee for an inheritance to
[38:37] possess it
[38:38] I hate honor don't take me out of
[38:40] context we're in in a different period
[38:43] here we're in the period of Grace
[38:49] only if that Commandments which I
[38:51] command thee this day so these first
[38:55] four verses will come about in the life
[38:57] of the children of Israel
[38:59] if
[39:00] they obey everything God told him to
[39:02] obey for the Lord thy God bless thee he
[39:07] promised me to doubt shall reign over
[39:10] many
[39:11] Nations but thou shall not Reign Over
[39:14] thee so he's given promises here if
[39:17] there be among you a poor man of one of
[39:19] my brethren within any of the gates in
[39:22] Thailand which the Lord thy God givethly
[39:25] and and
[39:26] this is
[39:28] this speaks to the age that we're in
[39:30] right now thou shall not hardened thy
[39:32] heart and they're sat behind hand from
[39:34] the poor brother but thou shall open my
[39:36] hand wide unto him and shall surely lend
[39:38] him sufficient for his need and that
[39:41] which he wanted that there be not a
[39:43] thought of in thy Wicked heart saying
[39:45] the seventh year of releases that end
[39:48] and uh evil eye be evil against thy poor
[39:51] brother but thou
[39:53] give
[39:55] some not
[39:59] if you come across that
[40:02] you come across that seventh year if you
[40:04] have
[40:05] an evil heart or evil way that you know
[40:08] basically what is saying if you're in
[40:10] the sixth or in the seventh year
[40:12] if you find yourself not helping your
[40:14] brother and sister you better you better
[40:17] be careful because if you're letting
[40:19] that knowing that the release is coming
[40:21] it shouldn't but if you would chill with
[40:23] me or I was thinking also another thing
[40:25] in the Bible
[40:29] if you I'll just read these things
[40:33] I've lost my place here this morning
[40:36] if you turn with me to Philippians the
[40:38] third chapter but I was going to go back
[40:41] here
[40:42] sometimes uh
[40:45] that's my place already
[41:02] you never know what's going on you you
[41:04] can't allow yourself to be
[41:08] if you all just finished with this this
[41:10] morning I was
[41:12] sitting there you know you you can come
[41:14] up here with a lot of things on your
[41:16] mind a lot of things on your heart and
[41:17] all of a sudden you can go blank
[41:21] that you don't want to say anything that
[41:22] would be out of character or out of
[41:24] place for for what's going on
[41:31] I lost my place and my train of thought
[41:34] this morning I I'm not afraid to be
[41:36] honest
[41:37] if you return with me to Philippians the
[41:39] third chapter
[41:42] or the fourth chapter I'll just read
[41:43] these thoughts and I can sit down this
[41:45] because
[41:47] you know I have that
[41:49] I have it in that uh I have it right
[41:53] here I read this a lot I some of you
[41:56] have those those books those healing
[41:58] thought books what deals have but it
[42:01] comes out of this scripture when I'm
[42:02] going a different direction but I'll
[42:05] read what brother Brown have to say
[42:06] about it and then I'll read out of the
[42:08] scripture where it comes from and I'll
[42:10] sit down with that
[42:12] and it goes back to what I was reading
[42:13] in Deuteronomy
[42:15] God expects us as Christians to be good
[42:18] brothers and sisters to treat each other
[42:20] with kindness with love with compassion
[42:23] and not to think of ourselves more than
[42:26] we really are and uh and what I thought
[42:29] about in Deuteronomy that chapter we
[42:31] read if you read in the gospels how the
[42:34] scribes and the Pharisees and Sadducees
[42:37] were
[42:38] yeah
[42:39] they had totally perverted the word of
[42:42] God and they were not treating their
[42:43] brothers and sisters like really the Old
[42:45] Testament told them they should
[42:47] and it's no different for us as
[42:49] Christians God has an expectation for us
[42:51] to be at a certain level the way we
[42:54] treat people and react with people and
[42:56] I'll just read this quote I read this a
[42:58] lot
[42:59] but this comes out of the healing
[43:01] thought it comes out of spiritual
[43:03] adoption I can't tell you the page but
[43:05] it says in order to stay with God you
[43:07] have to stay gentle and uh for I can
[43:10] only speak for this man that's a hard
[43:13] thing to do sometimes it's hard to step
[43:15] back and not to say a harsh thing or say
[43:17] a harsh word in order to stay with God
[43:20] Stay Stay gentle God is gentle
[43:24] God is really gentle he never he's a
[43:25] gentleman he doesn't force you to do
[43:27] something he might lead you and push you
[43:30] to do something but he's not going to
[43:32] force you to do anything
[43:33] and he goes on the same
[43:36] in order to stay with God stay with love
[43:38] God is love stay Meek don't ever be
[43:40] self-sufficient I got to raise my hand
[43:42] I'm a man I like being self-sufficient
[43:45] is it good for me no I already need to
[43:47] depend more on the grace of God and his
[43:50] leading in my life than I depend on my
[43:52] own right hand
[43:53] always rely upon him never use your own
[43:56] mind take his thoughts
[43:58] but his thoughts be your thoughts fake
[44:00] them in your carnal mind so even though
[44:04] maybe you haven't had this relationship
[44:06] like you need to have
[44:07] but brother Brandon has given you a
[44:09] principle like any good minister of the
[44:12] Gospel will give you you might not have
[44:14] that experience yet but if you'll take
[44:16] the word of God and continually read it
[44:19] and apply it daily just keep reading it
[44:23] breeding it reading and you'll find that
[44:26] thought that's in that word of God will
[44:27] possess you and that'll be the thought
[44:29] that you need and he goes his
[44:32] thoughts and we know what his thoughts
[44:34] are his thoughts are the word of God I
[44:36] got laid out here this morning it's not
[44:38] what I think it's what God's word says
[44:40] let his thoughts be your thoughts take
[44:42] them into your carnal mind repeat them
[44:45] over and over so you not that not that
[44:48] you pay Prairie part of them
[44:51] probably but you can't read the same
[44:54] scripture enough again and again until
[44:56] it becomes a part of your heart and your
[44:58] life over and over and say oh God take
[45:01] all my doubt away let my thoughts be
[45:03] your thoughts
[45:05] and that's really hard in the age like I
[45:07] say there's so much out there trying to
[45:09] possess your mind and your souls out
[45:11] there it takes a long time sometimes
[45:14] after dealing with everyone out there in
[45:16] the world to let to get quiet enough
[45:18] that your thoughts and God thoughts can
[45:20] be the same thing so
[45:23] I take my doubt away let my thoughts be
[45:26] your thoughts just Cast Away the thought
[45:29] of sickness takes God's healing thought
[45:31] let them become your thoughts and think
[45:34] on these things but you whatever it is
[45:37] it could be sickness it could be
[45:39] Financial Health that you need whatever
[45:41] it is you just gotta continually think
[45:45] on those things and pray on those things
[45:46] and I'll just read what this says here
[45:48] and then sit down it's the it's actually
[45:51] the fourth child
[45:54] Factory
[45:56] first rejoice in the lord always and I
[45:59] again say rejoice
[46:01] and that's where this
[46:03] this that's where this quote would go
[46:05] back to
[46:07] let your moderation begin on to all men
[46:10] and the Lord is at hand and that's
[46:13] really necessary in the age there's no
[46:15] moderation out there in the world it
[46:17] should be in the Christian church but in
[46:19] the world there's no moderation anymore
[46:22] be known unto all men the Lord is at
[46:24] hand be careful for nothing but in
[46:28] everything by prayer and supplication
[46:30] and with Thanksgiving let your requests
[46:32] be known unto God
[46:34] and the peace of God which passes all
[46:36] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[46:38] Minds through Christ Jesus and that's a
[46:41] real important principle right there
[46:45] you just got to let go and sometimes and
[46:47] let God have his way is it easy to do no
[46:50] it's not easy to do but it's required
[46:52] finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[46:55] true whatsoever things are honest
[46:57] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[47:00] things are pure what's
[47:02] wherever things are lovely whatsoever
[47:04] thing are good report if there be any

[1:31:26] don't y'all know that so but you know
[1:31:29] it's it's so good to be here brother
[1:31:30] Thomas inviting us to come and just a
[1:31:33] couple weeks ago I had him and sister
[1:31:35] Donna and the church on my heart and I
[1:31:38] was praying and I said well God it's
[1:31:39] been a while since I've been there since
[1:31:41] maybe dropping in his ear I'd like to go
[1:31:43] back and see them and in just a week or
[1:31:46] so later he texted me and did my heart
[1:31:48] good and appreciate the invite and
[1:31:50] Brother Joseph sends his greetings to
[1:31:52] each and every one of you this morning
[1:31:54] and
[1:31:55] um
[1:31:56] from back home there and
[1:31:58] had a little youth get together last
[1:32:00] night and went a little longer than I
[1:32:03] thought but the kids had a good time and
[1:32:05] uh one of them was in from Arizona says
[1:32:08] that they know
[1:32:09] their sister is good friends with
[1:32:12] the
[1:32:13] um
[1:32:14] well Hallelujah why did y'all just go
[1:32:17] blank when you come up here but we was
[1:32:19] talking about y'all last night too so
[1:32:21] amen y'all forgive me there's something
[1:32:23] that's a magnet or something that just
[1:32:25] sucks all your thoughts up when you come
[1:32:28] out here so amen and Bill Joe I want to
[1:32:32] say that
[1:32:33] about 11 30 last night in prayer what me
[1:32:35] and you talked about God laid on my
[1:32:37] heart that you was going to do
[1:32:39] God's got a blessing for you
[1:32:42] I was at a word loss
[1:32:44] I didn't know what to say because
[1:32:46] sitting in prayer last night God told me
[1:32:48] exactly what he was going to say
[1:32:51] in
[1:32:53] it just means so much to me and I pray
[1:32:56] God's blessing on the church on on each
[1:32:58] and every one of you so forget the
[1:33:00] scripture we'll go to the scripture this
[1:33:01] morning amen
[1:33:04] appreciate each one of you being out and
[1:33:06] did you come to health church this
[1:33:07] morning hey man it's uh it's one thing
[1:33:10] to gather together it's another thing to
[1:33:12] have church there's a lot of churches
[1:33:14] across the land that are gathering as
[1:33:17] large as wood and they're getting
[1:33:18] together and they're singing songs and
[1:33:20] they're doing the best that they know
[1:33:21] how but there's something different when
[1:33:23] we can allow God to take control when we
[1:33:26] can get out of the way and say God it
[1:33:27] isn't about me it isn't about me but
[1:33:30] it's about you and you know I uh I've
[1:33:32] learned that I can make a mess out of a
[1:33:35] lot of things but if I can let him have
[1:33:37] control it's it's all in his hands and
[1:33:40] First Corinthians 2 and then in Matthew
[1:33:43] 28 we'll take a couple of scriptures
[1:33:45] First Corinthians 2 wrote very familiar
[1:33:48] to you and uh I tell you this was over
[1:33:50] the winter time and we was a snowstorm
[1:33:53] come through and we didn't know was
[1:33:55] going to have church or not Sunday and
[1:33:57] Saturday morning we I rode out to the
[1:33:59] church there to because you've ever been
[1:34:01] there church it sits on a hill there and
[1:34:03] there's ice and snow just covered the
[1:34:06] parking lot you don't want nobody to
[1:34:07] have a break and went out to the church
[1:34:09] and we sit there at the church and just
[1:34:11] sitting there praying and as the sun
[1:34:13] come up you begin to see it just all
[1:34:15] fall away
[1:34:17] a little thought come to me the power of
[1:34:20] the Sun
[1:34:21] the power of the Sun
[1:34:23] First Corinthians 2 verse 1
[1:34:26] says in our Brethren when I came to you
[1:34:29] came to not with Excellence of speech or
[1:34:33] of wisdom declaring unto you the
[1:34:36] testimony of God for I determine
[1:34:38] determine not to know anything among you
[1:34:41] save Jesus Christ in him crucified
[1:34:45] and I was with you in weakness and in
[1:34:48] fear and in much trembling in my speech
[1:34:51] and my preaching was not with enticing
[1:34:53] words of men's wisdom but a
[1:34:55] demonstration of spirit and of power
[1:35:00] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:35:02] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[1:35:06] it's not what you and I can do but it's
[1:35:08] what he can do through each and every
[1:35:10] one of us in Matthew 28 and with the
[1:35:13] Lord's help we'll try to tie them
[1:35:14] together and and say something to bless
[1:35:16] you this morning Matthew 28 verse 16.
[1:35:21] is the last commission that Christ give
[1:35:23] to the to us and he's letting us know
[1:35:26] that it just wasn't him but now it's you
[1:35:29] with that same power Matthew 28 says
[1:35:34] then the 11 disciples went away into
[1:35:35] Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had
[1:35:38] appointed them
[1:35:39] and they saw him and they worshiped him
[1:35:42] but some doubted
[1:35:44] Jesus came and he spoke unto them saying
[1:35:47] all power
[1:35:48] is given unto me in heaven and in Earth
[1:35:53] it's all power was given unto me and he
[1:35:55] says all that I am I poured it into the
[1:35:58] church
[1:35:58] it does no good to tell a history it
[1:36:01] does no good to think about what Christ
[1:36:03] did if he can't live inside of you today
[1:36:06] you are the living Christ today you are
[1:36:09] the example to the world today and now
[1:36:12] he's saying all that I have I'm going to
[1:36:14] give it to you he says now you go you
[1:36:18] therefore and teach All Nations
[1:36:21] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:36:23] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:25] teaching them to observe all things
[1:36:28] whatsoever I have commended you and lo I
[1:36:32] Am With You Always even to the end of
[1:36:36] the world Amen
[1:36:38] Heavenly Father Lord we love you Lord we
[1:36:41] truly appreciate you Lord and Lord so
[1:36:44] many things can be said about your love
[1:36:46] and what you've done in this morning
[1:36:48] Lord you've heard the testimonies Lord
[1:36:51] you've heard the teaching Lord you've
[1:36:52] heard the songs of Zion Lord and Lord I
[1:36:56] believe that you're pleased with us this
[1:36:58] morning Lord you truly love us and we
[1:37:00] truly love you and this morning we ask
[1:37:03] now Lord that I myself can get out of
[1:37:05] the way Lord and Lord I would make a
[1:37:08] mess and I would say things that was of
[1:37:10] an uncertain sound that Lord if you'll
[1:37:13] take control we'll hear the voice and
[1:37:16] they'll go Lord God and not Lord we ask
[1:37:19] you to be with us Lord let me step aside
[1:37:21] use this vessel use their vessels let
[1:37:24] them hear what you'd have them to say in
[1:37:26] your lovely name we pray amen and amen
[1:37:30] and you have your seats this morning
[1:37:31] I think this morning is
[1:37:34] and I'm going to take this off
[1:37:37] I don't know why we even wear it out
[1:37:39] here sometimes
[1:37:40] oh nothing the one preacher when he
[1:37:42] starts preaching he starts rolling his
[1:37:43] sleeves up you know so whatever's you're
[1:37:46] comfortable let's just be comfortable in
[1:37:47] him this morning but in 1965 we'll fall
[1:37:50] that I come across that just just did me
[1:37:52] good and I think there's so much in that
[1:37:54] is the power of the Sun and we begin to
[1:37:57] think that all that Christ did but that
[1:38:00] wasn't good enough because now he
[1:38:01] performs it in you and I and he says and
[1:38:04] who is this Melchizedek in 1965 he says
[1:38:06] but one day his mama flew over and she
[1:38:09] screamed and he recognized it he said
[1:38:12] that sound why why he was an eagle to
[1:38:15] begin with he was always an eagle but
[1:38:17] one day he heard that equals cry he said
[1:38:20] you always a child of God even when you
[1:38:23] lived in sin you as a child of God God
[1:38:25] knew you before the foundation of the
[1:38:28] world but one day you had to hear that
[1:38:30] voice and that voice was a certain sound
[1:38:33] it wasn't an uncertain sound it ranged
[1:38:36] true on the inner being of you and you
[1:38:39] believe that's what your calling was and
[1:38:41] he said and that's the way it is with
[1:38:43] the gospel or the word or the power of
[1:38:46] Jesus Christ when a man has been
[1:38:48] predestinated to eternal life he hears
[1:38:51] that true ring that scream of God and
[1:38:54] nothing can keep him from it amen
[1:38:57] nothing can keep you from it this
[1:38:59] morning and and I believe is the powers
[1:39:01] that says we would type it and we would
[1:39:03] think of the natural realm and the power
[1:39:05] of that son and and you know it could be
[1:39:08] a cold bitter day but if that sun peers
[1:39:11] out between the clouds you can feel the
[1:39:13] warmth of that sun you can feel the
[1:39:15] warmth of that sun on your body and it
[1:39:18] would melt away all of the eyes it would
[1:39:20] it would melt away all of the snow but
[1:39:22] there's something about the power of
[1:39:24] that sun that nothing contained that
[1:39:26] hour nothing can calm that's and you you
[1:39:29] know man creates air conditioners but
[1:39:32] you know what you go down the road and
[1:39:33] that sun coming through the windshield
[1:39:35] still produces heat you got to keep
[1:39:37] cranking it up to get it out because you
[1:39:39] can't contain that power but spiritually
[1:39:42] speaking it's the same way with the
[1:39:44] power of the Son of God the power of the
[1:39:46] Son of God nothing to contain it from
[1:39:49] moving what God had called him to do as
[1:39:51] he would walk upon his Landing in the
[1:39:54] days that he lived here on the Sea of
[1:39:56] Galilee as he would begin to demonstrate
[1:39:59] in power of His heavenly father there
[1:40:02] was nothing could hold him back there
[1:40:04] was no devil that could hold him back
[1:40:05] there was no depression that could hold
[1:40:07] him back when he walked in he took
[1:40:10] control of the situations when he walked
[1:40:12] in he took control of every circumstance
[1:40:15] there was out there and I believe if we
[1:40:17] can look and we can also see that same
[1:40:20] God is living in you and I denied that
[1:40:23] same God is a part of our being that we
[1:40:26] take control
[1:40:28] that's why we can be happy that's why we
[1:40:31] can be joyous when the devil gives us
[1:40:34] things and he trips us up and he gives
[1:40:36] us sicknesses it gives us Temptation
[1:40:38] there's something in us that can
[1:40:41] overcome that why because we have the
[1:40:44] power of the sun inside of us they can
[1:40:46] overcome all that the enemy has
[1:40:50] and that's what makes the enemy mad
[1:40:51] because like he said like what David was
[1:40:54] saying he don't understand that he can
[1:40:56] do all of this to us and we come to
[1:40:59] church anyway and we praise God anyway
[1:41:01] because there's something inside of us
[1:41:04] that is reflecting the Son of God and
[1:41:06] nothing contain that
[1:41:08] nothing can take control of that and
[1:41:11] begin to say to quote with your own he
[1:41:13] said oh the church might say days of
[1:41:16] Miracles is passed brother when it goes
[1:41:19] cluck cluck cluck talking about the
[1:41:21] chickens he said stand here and eat this
[1:41:23] stand here and eat that he said oh the
[1:41:26] Barnyard stuff won't do anymore come on
[1:41:29] church God when we heard that Mother's
[1:41:32] cream when we heard the word for her day
[1:41:35] it go in her ears the denominations
[1:41:37] would not work anymore what they had was
[1:41:40] not satisfy anymore what they had would
[1:41:44] not give us a satisfaction anymore
[1:41:46] because we had heard from another rhythm
[1:41:51] Church we're living in a day that the
[1:41:53] word for her day is there is a pride
[1:41:55] that is preparing to be raptured away we
[1:41:58] don't want to hear about what the
[1:42:00] denomination say we don't want to hear
[1:42:02] about what politics say we don't want to
[1:42:04] hear
[1:42:05] about all the criticism and all the
[1:42:08] falling away we want to hear what the
[1:42:11] word is saying to the church and it is
[1:42:13] to be ready for a child
[1:42:17] he said that barnyard stuff won't do
[1:42:19] anymore he said he's gone he said now
[1:42:21] all things are possible see he gets off
[1:42:25] the ground you know he talked about that
[1:42:27] mother Eagle he said he began to Flap
[1:42:29] his ring and he began to come off the
[1:42:31] ground you know what when you come off
[1:42:33] the ground you don't see things like
[1:42:34] there was anymore when you're down in
[1:42:37] the middle of that monk when you're down
[1:42:38] the middle of the mirror things look so
[1:42:41] depressing things looks like you can't
[1:42:43] overcome but if you ever get up on the
[1:42:45] chart of God come on if you ever get up
[1:42:47] on the Mountaintop if you ever look back
[1:42:50] down you'll see the power son there's
[1:42:53] nothing that can overcome that power
[1:42:56] and now that if you're laying in that
[1:42:57] monk you know what you need to know you
[1:43:00] need to do like David did when David
[1:43:02] come and they took his wife so they took
[1:43:04] his children it's a scripture would say
[1:43:06] that David went and intercouraged
[1:43:09] himself in the Lord what did he do he
[1:43:12] went back to that Mountaintop experience
[1:43:14] come on children of God he went back to
[1:43:17] that Mountaintop experience and he saw
[1:43:19] something was real
[1:43:21] he saw that same Mountaintop experience
[1:43:23] what did it do it created something in
[1:43:26] him it showed him that the power of the
[1:43:28] sun was real it showed him that he
[1:43:31] didn't matter where he found himself the
[1:43:33] power of the sun would get melt
[1:43:37] what did he do he went back to God you
[1:43:40] know to God that's what we need to do
[1:43:41] we're living in a day that every time
[1:43:43] you turn the news radio negative
[1:43:45] negative negative Lord I'll be talking
[1:43:47] about now it's a submarine come on
[1:43:50] are you gonna laugh it's funny I mean
[1:43:52] thankfully that they died I'm not saying
[1:43:54] that but come on really men trying to do
[1:43:57] things that are outside of their realm
[1:43:58] come on people look at what we're living
[1:44:00] we're living in a day that the men in
[1:44:03] this world is trying to be Gods they're
[1:44:05] trying to take things in their control
[1:44:07] but without the power of the sun they
[1:44:10] cannot do it come on children of God
[1:44:14] without the holy ghost in your lives you
[1:44:17] cannot live this life without a baptism
[1:44:19] of the Holy Ghost in your life without
[1:44:22] being born again Jesus says ye must be
[1:44:26] born again
[1:44:28] why because he knew we didn't have a
[1:44:29] chance
[1:44:30] without that power
[1:44:32] come on oh you can put a tie on oh you
[1:44:36] can look good oh you can come to church
[1:44:38] and you can full half the congregation
[1:44:40] that everything's all right but you
[1:44:42] ain't fooling yourself you're looking in
[1:44:45] your own life and you know where you're
[1:44:46] walking and you know you need the power
[1:44:49] of God in your life
[1:44:51] brother Jonathan how do you know that
[1:44:53] because I was there
[1:44:55] come on church I'm not so spiritual that
[1:44:58] I'm above anybody I'm as human as
[1:45:00] anybody in this building I've lived and
[1:45:02] I wanted I laid in that presence to
[1:45:05] where I knew what the power of God was I
[1:45:07] knew what the power of the sun was but
[1:45:09] it hasn't resonated
[1:45:11] inside of me yet and it didn't do me any
[1:45:14] good
[1:45:15] when a trial would come I would fall
[1:45:18] flat on my face when the enemy would
[1:45:21] come I would do the exact option what I
[1:45:23] knew I should do I was raised in this
[1:45:25] message I knew what I should do I knew
[1:45:28] what I should say I knew how I should
[1:45:30] live but I couldn't do until I had a
[1:45:33] reflection of that power in my life
[1:45:38] brother Brendan goes on down and he says
[1:45:40] and that's what's the matter with so
[1:45:42] many Christians today they can't get
[1:45:45] their feet off the ground
[1:45:48] children of God that's what's wrong with
[1:45:50] this day we're looking around at all of
[1:45:52] our problems we're looking around at all
[1:45:55] of our symptoms we're looking around at
[1:45:57] all of our sickness we're looking around
[1:45:58] at all the politics and what not looking
[1:46:01] to the power of the sun we're not
[1:46:04] looking to God and seeing what he has in
[1:46:06] store for us
[1:46:08] you remember the scripture would tell us
[1:46:09] he says he that begin a good work in you
[1:46:12] he shall finish it come on
[1:46:17] has he been a good work in you come on
[1:46:20] don't be ashamed of it has he became a
[1:46:22] good work in you that if he's beginner
[1:46:24] could work in you then the power of the
[1:46:27] son is laying inside of you and you're
[1:46:30] ready to shine to the world
[1:46:32] see the problem is we got too many
[1:46:34] message preachers that can quote all the
[1:46:36] quotes come on
[1:46:38] come on
[1:46:39] they can quote all the crows they can
[1:46:41] get you excited they can make you run
[1:46:44] and Shout but have they told you
[1:46:46] anything about the power of the Sun have
[1:46:48] they told you anything about Jesus
[1:46:51] Christ
[1:46:52] this is You Don't Preach Jesus you ain't
[1:46:54] preaching the same message I am
[1:46:57] come on George
[1:46:59] we take all this message Theology and
[1:47:02] it's gotten as bad as bad as theology
[1:47:04] come on church we take all this message
[1:47:07] Theology and we get off into so many
[1:47:09] look
[1:47:10] there ain't a denomination out there
[1:47:12] that is messed up as that is the message
[1:47:14] come on churches we be honest oh we want
[1:47:17] to protect our little patents and act
[1:47:19] like that no we got more confusion under
[1:47:23] the name of William Branham than any
[1:47:25] other Martin Luther John Luke whatever
[1:47:28] you want to count them out why because
[1:47:30] we left the power of the Sun and we went
[1:47:33] to men's ideals and we demands creeds
[1:47:37] come on I'll tell young people all the
[1:47:39] time don't ever bring one
[1:47:41] to me to justify your life
[1:47:43] don't do it because number one the first
[1:47:46] thing it told me you're defensive
[1:47:49] and if you're defensive then that means
[1:47:51] God's dealing with you and trying to
[1:47:53] show you the power of the Sun and trying
[1:47:56] to lead you out and into a better life
[1:47:59] but you're fighting with everything you
[1:48:01] have to keep from moving on
[1:48:04] imma tell you why we're not further
[1:48:06] along than we are because of you and me
[1:48:09] come on it ain't because of the world
[1:48:12] it ain't because of the denominations it
[1:48:15] ain't because of the ones that worshiped
[1:48:16] by profit it ain't because of all the
[1:48:19] critics in this message it's because
[1:48:20] it's you and I the bride of Christ is
[1:48:24] yet to stand and take her position and
[1:48:27] realize the power's not in denomination
[1:48:29] the power's not in the critic the
[1:48:31] power's not in the Theologian it's in
[1:48:33] the pride
[1:48:35] of Christ this morning
[1:48:38] well I just don't know if I can stand
[1:48:40] against them you can't
[1:48:42] but he can
[1:48:44] come on Judge when are we going to let
[1:48:47] go and let God have his way when are we
[1:48:50] going to let go so you know what I don't
[1:48:51] care what anybody else thinks about me
[1:48:53] if I jump up and shouting then I want
[1:48:55] them to look because there's something
[1:48:57] inside of me that's revealing to the
[1:48:59] world there's a power laying there
[1:49:02] or something
[1:49:03] in my life
[1:49:05] do you really think you know I've said
[1:49:07] this before y'all heard me say it we can
[1:49:09] go to any Old Testament story we can go
[1:49:11] to any new testament story and we can
[1:49:13] find do you really think that David
[1:49:15] wanted to face Goliath in himself
[1:49:19] David you Goliath was a bigger man David
[1:49:23] knew glass was trained in Warfare but
[1:49:26] there was a power laying in him come on
[1:49:28] Church there was something laying inside
[1:49:31] of him that got offended when Goliath
[1:49:33] come against the God that he served and
[1:49:36] he said you know what I don't know what
[1:49:38] I'm going to do but I know my God is not
[1:49:41] going to stand for this come on church I
[1:49:44] know that my God isn't going to stand
[1:49:46] for this devil I know that my God it's
[1:49:49] not going to stand against the devil
[1:49:51] attacking the body they would switch
[1:49:53] them
[1:49:54] and there's a power inside of a Ministry
[1:49:56] today there's a power instead of a pride
[1:49:58] today that's going to stand up and say
[1:50:01] he that is within me it's greater than
[1:50:04] he that's in the world come on Church
[1:50:08] the power
[1:50:09] of the Sun
[1:50:12] it took Moses
[1:50:13] what did he do to Moses Moses was scared
[1:50:18] to go down to Egypt
[1:50:20] come on
[1:50:21] Moses ran and hid on the backside of the
[1:50:24] desert and we say oh why did he do that
[1:50:26] the same way that we do come on church
[1:50:29] it's the same thing that we do when God
[1:50:32] calls you to do something you run and
[1:50:33] hide from it come on church I can hear
[1:50:36] you
[1:50:39] he running here
[1:50:41] but when he got in the presence of the
[1:50:44] power of the Sun
[1:50:46] you know what he did he grabbed him a
[1:50:48] cane he said Aaron come on we're gonna
[1:50:51] go take over
[1:50:52] why there was something changed in his
[1:50:54] life he got recognized
[1:50:56] that's who he was he recognized that it
[1:50:59] was more than his Godly flesh it was
[1:51:01] more than what his mind could do but now
[1:51:04] there was a power inside of him what he
[1:51:06] did he looked at the Lord he looked at
[1:51:08] the bush he looked at the example of the
[1:51:11] power of son in his life and he said
[1:51:13] what shall I say
[1:51:16] maybe that's what we should do come on
[1:51:18] church instead of trying to figure it
[1:51:20] out himself come on come on it's the
[1:51:23] whale you know I've been here before and
[1:51:26] I know exactly what they're going
[1:51:27] through no you don't
[1:51:30] if you ain't sitting in their shoes you
[1:51:31] don't know what they're going through
[1:51:33] we trial every temptation to fix every
[1:51:35] individual a different way
[1:51:37] you may have known what it did to you
[1:51:39] but you don't know what he's doing to
[1:51:41] them you don't know how hard it is for
[1:51:43] them
[1:51:44] come on Church
[1:51:46] some of us have quit smoking and we
[1:51:48] think you know you just gotta set a man
[1:51:49] or attitude you do
[1:51:51] but you know what there's a demon inside
[1:51:54] of that tobacco nicotine there's a demon
[1:51:57] inside of that nicotine that latches a
[1:51:59] hold of an individual's soul and without
[1:52:01] the power of the sun they
[1:52:03] scrum it
[1:52:05] come on Church
[1:52:06] there's a power in that alcohol that
[1:52:09] gets a hold of the soul of that
[1:52:10] individual you can go through Alcoholic
[1:52:13] Anonymous you could go through all of
[1:52:15] the meetings and they still struggle
[1:52:17] with it out of their lives
[1:52:19] but if you ever get in the power of the
[1:52:21] Sun
[1:52:22] it takes you to desire out of your heart
[1:52:24] it takes a desire out of your soul and
[1:52:26] the power of the sun comes down in your
[1:52:29] life
[1:52:31] angels
[1:52:34] but yeah we want to figure it out come
[1:52:36] on Church
[1:52:37] come on Church
[1:52:39] we want to figure our own problems that
[1:52:41] we want to be the man of the house
[1:52:44] let me tell you something Jesus is the
[1:52:45] man of my house
[1:52:47] I can't figure it out come on but he can
[1:52:50] figure it out every time I get to the
[1:52:53] place that I can't go no further and
[1:52:56] then I let go and I let God have his way
[1:52:59] that's when Miracles begin to happen
[1:53:01] it's not because I read so much it's not
[1:53:04] because I quoted so much it's not
[1:53:06] because I prayed so much it's not
[1:53:08] because I went to church so much it's
[1:53:10] because I let go and I said the power of
[1:53:13] the sun resembles in my life I let you
[1:53:16] take control of this vessel I let you
[1:53:18] live in my life I let you take control
[1:53:22] of this situation what is it
[1:53:25] too many of us
[1:53:27] we're too worried about what everybody
[1:53:29] else thinks
[1:53:30] we've left notes now y'all pulling this
[1:53:32] morning y'all pull our preaching
[1:53:35] come on Church
[1:53:37] what is it we're too worried about all
[1:53:39] the symptoms around
[1:53:42] yo we got people in the ministers that
[1:53:44] knows more about politics than they know
[1:53:45] about the Bible
[1:53:46] what's wrong with this come on church
[1:53:48] I'm just being real this morning okay
[1:53:51] what's wrong with this we got people on
[1:53:54] Facebook that are quote CNN but they
[1:53:56] won't quote The Profit come on Church
[1:53:58] what is it that we believe we believe
[1:54:01] that this last day message in this hour
[1:54:03] that the son himself walked upon the
[1:54:06] Earth gave the commission oh God brought
[1:54:09] a prophet upon the sea to show us the
[1:54:11] message for our day which is there is a
[1:54:14] pride
[1:54:16] why do you think he never pointed at
[1:54:18] himself
[1:54:19] who points at him
[1:54:20] everybody that's gotta gotta confused
[1:54:23] accepted you
[1:54:25] and they try to build him up and make
[1:54:27] him something more than he is that was a
[1:54:29] prophet of God I don't take nothing away
[1:54:31] from what God used him for but that is
[1:54:34] not the god that is the vessel that God
[1:54:37] used and in that vessel he brought a
[1:54:40] bride to recognize the power of the son
[1:54:42] in her
[1:54:43] Daddy
[1:54:46] you know what you want to know what
[1:54:48] happened if that man come back he'd tear
[1:54:51] up about 90 of message churches in this
[1:54:53] land come on church I don't know if I'd
[1:54:56] want to be there I don't know if I'd
[1:54:58] want to be there because he would tear
[1:54:59] the hide off of about 90 of message
[1:55:02] believers
[1:55:04] because we're not doing what he asked us
[1:55:06] to do he told us he gave us a word he
[1:55:10] told us the power of the son was in
[1:55:12] Christ alone it is in the Savior it is
[1:55:15] in the Lord Jesus Christ he says all
[1:55:18] that I do I do because he gives me the
[1:55:20] right
[1:55:23] that was free
[1:55:25] come on Church
[1:55:27] what is it first Thessalonians 1 we find
[1:55:30] in first Thessalonians 1 chapter 1 verse
[1:55:33] 4 said knowing Brethren beloved your
[1:55:36] election of God
[1:55:37] you know what
[1:55:39] somebody can't come tell you that you're
[1:55:40] saved
[1:55:42] you know I've met too many people that
[1:55:44] have lived good righteous life but never
[1:55:46] had the power of the son in them come on
[1:55:49] Church
[1:55:50] what happens to the one that I fell away
[1:55:51] look there's ministers that have
[1:55:53] preached this for 40 years and they fell
[1:55:56] away what happened they was told that
[1:55:59] they were Son of God but they never
[1:56:01] experienced the power of the sun because
[1:56:03] once Moses experience the power of the
[1:56:06] sun no devil in hell could stop you from
[1:56:09] what God called him to do what you
[1:56:11] experience the power of the sun there's
[1:56:14] no devil in hell that can stop you from
[1:56:17] going to the rapture
[1:56:18] there's no deceptive power there's been
[1:56:21] Trust
[1:56:22] it's a power
[1:56:24] but we get on that for a minute if you
[1:56:26] want to
[1:56:26] you realize we live in the day of
[1:56:29] influencers
[1:56:31] oh Lord help us
[1:56:33] there should be one influencer and
[1:56:34] that's him
[1:56:37] but we dress like the influencer dresses
[1:56:40] come on Church
[1:56:41] y'all are not blind y'all see the
[1:56:43] tactics of the enemy you'll see what the
[1:56:45] world's doing it's trying to influence
[1:56:47] you away from the power of the sun it's
[1:56:51] trying to influence you into the power
[1:56:53] of the world the power of devil the
[1:56:56] power of Politics the power of churches
[1:56:58] the power of denominations
[1:57:03] all right I'll give you an example
[1:57:05] of course the first thing that a pastor
[1:57:07] does when he starts to leave this man
[1:57:12] he takes too many churches seeing it
[1:57:13] happened too many times
[1:57:15] they take the picture down and they take
[1:57:16] the books out of the best of you
[1:57:18] why because he's starting to try to
[1:57:21] influence you away from the word for
[1:57:23] your day
[1:57:25] come on Church
[1:57:26] come on he's trying to influence you and
[1:57:29] get your mind away from everything why
[1:57:31] is it that
[1:57:32] Catholic Church he don't want you to
[1:57:34] read your Bible
[1:57:36] because then you come with questions
[1:57:38] because they thought they want to place
[1:57:39] oh it's a Matthew 28 it's baptism and
[1:57:43] Trinity and then and the three godhead
[1:57:46] but then when you start reading your
[1:57:48] Bible you catch a revelation like Peter
[1:57:50] did you come across Acts 2 and you go
[1:57:52] wait a second something don't sound
[1:57:55] right about what that is saying there's
[1:57:57] something true in the word of God that
[1:58:00] says that the name of the Father the
[1:58:02] name of the son the name of the Holy
[1:58:04] Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:07] if they don't want you to see that so
[1:58:09] they try to pull the material back and
[1:58:11] he influence you under their influence
[1:58:14] you better get away from anything like
[1:58:16] that
[1:58:17] anybody that tells you not to read the
[1:58:19] Bible and not have questions you better
[1:58:21] get away from them
[1:58:22] because I promise you there ain't a man
[1:58:24] alive that has every answer to this
[1:58:25] Bible
[1:58:26] there's a man living or walking or has
[1:58:29] ever walked outside of Jesus Christ that
[1:58:31] knows every every question in this Bible
[1:58:33] that knows every answer but God laid it
[1:58:36] there and what did he do he played it
[1:58:38] out so perfectly that he would Place
[1:58:40] Jesus upon this Earth that he replaced
[1:58:43] the prophets upon this Earth they
[1:58:45] replace pastors teachers evangelists
[1:58:47] prophets Apostles upon the Earth so that
[1:58:50] we could enter into the word of God and
[1:58:52] we could preach from the Oracles of God
[1:58:54] and say I may not have the interest but
[1:58:56] he has the answer because he is the
[1:58:58] power of the son
[1:59:01] knowing brother and blood
[1:59:03] your election of God
[1:59:05] for our Gods will come not unto you in
[1:59:07] word only but also in power come on
[1:59:11] Church
[1:59:11] the bride ain't some deep down
[1:59:13] red-headed stepchild that don't ever get
[1:59:15] away come on get that thought out of
[1:59:17] your head we got the young people
[1:59:19] running around going man they're living
[1:59:21] for God's like this I don't know if I
[1:59:23] should live for god well you know what
[1:59:25] you're not living for the right God
[1:59:26] because you start living for the God
[1:59:28] that I live for it makes you happy it
[1:59:31] makes you celebrate it makes you run it
[1:59:34] makes you you shout amen it makes you
[1:59:37] jump up and down it makes you want to go
[1:59:39] to church not just because mama said but
[1:59:42] there's something inside of you you
[1:59:44] start dragging Mama to church
[1:59:51] because the Shins today there's a lot of
[1:59:53] message Believers today that needs the
[1:59:55] power of the son to start melting back
[1:59:57] the cold hearts come on we're ashamed to
[2:00:00] say Amen in church what's wrong with us
[2:00:02] God is living in the Praises of his
[2:00:05] people I want to praise him this morning
[2:00:08] I want to say God here I am to worship
[2:00:10] and to magnify your name here I am to
[2:00:13] reflect the power of God in my life
[2:00:17] thank you
[2:00:18] you get hot enough your family will get
[2:00:21] hot too

[2:00:36] there in a queue like this
[2:00:37] you don't think every one of your kids
[2:00:39] is looking at you
[2:00:41] come on man of God come on man of God
[2:00:43] you don't think every child is looking
[2:00:46] at you as an example going well he don't
[2:00:48] even want to be here either
[2:00:51] he ain't even happy to be here
[2:00:54] but you let the spirit of God you let
[2:00:56] the power of the Sun reflect upon your
[2:00:58] life you go running down that aisle one
[2:01:01] time and you see a whole Caravan of
[2:01:03] young people running behind you because
[2:01:04] they realize the power of the sun is
[2:01:07] real in his life
[2:01:09] there's something
[2:01:11] that's anointed of God in an
[2:01:13] individual's life they just don't care
[2:01:15] anymore
[2:01:18] half my life come on he got me so sloppy
[2:01:22] drunk that I made a fool of myself come
[2:01:25] on I come to light poem Burger King
[2:01:27] parking lot and waved at everybody
[2:01:29] come on
[2:01:30] he made a fool out of me so do you think
[2:01:33] I care if God makes a fool of me God
[2:01:35] make a fool of me let me be any Chapel
[2:01:38] to the world that the power of the son
[2:01:40] is living inside of me didn't I
[2:01:46] maybe I need to climb the light pole and
[2:01:48] start Chelsea down tracks now come on
[2:01:51] whatever you want me to do God
[2:01:53] let the power
[2:01:54] power reflect in this life
[2:01:56] let the power of the Sun reflect in this
[2:01:59] so bad you know what when I was a kid I
[2:02:01] was 13 14 year old look
[2:02:05] I'm gonna say this but I'm gonna tell
[2:02:07] the young people something first
[2:02:09] there's coming a generation
[2:02:11] that you're going to listen to what your
[2:02:13] elders are saying and you're gonna have
[2:02:16] to live this way you're not going to
[2:02:18] have to live for the devil
[2:02:20] there's a greater testimony in a young
[2:02:23] person's life that they can stand up
[2:02:26] before the church won't testimony died
[2:02:28] and say I've never smoked
[2:02:31] I've never drunk I've never lusted after
[2:02:34] a woman I've never did these things why
[2:02:36] because the power of the sun was in my
[2:02:39] life for my youth and I represented God
[2:02:42] in my ear
[2:02:46] come on Church
[2:02:47] too many of our young people has got
[2:02:49] this interpretation in their heads that
[2:02:51] they've got to go into the world and sin
[2:02:54] that's a lie of the devil
[2:02:57] the greatest testimony is is to stand up
[2:03:00] and say I lived every day of my life for
[2:03:03] God
[2:03:06] come on Church you say it ain't possible
[2:03:08] oh it's possible with the power of the
[2:03:11] sun you know what you let some young
[2:03:13] person 12 13 11 10 you don't put an age
[2:03:16] limit on it you let God come down into
[2:03:18] their life sanctify that Soul baptize
[2:03:21] them again with the feelness with the
[2:03:23] fullness of the Holy Spirit and they'll
[2:03:25] live a better life than the adults in
[2:03:27] the church and you don't even have to
[2:03:29] tell them to come home Church
[2:03:32] because it's the power of the sun inside
[2:03:34] of them they don't have to be told right
[2:03:36] from who there's something inside of
[2:03:38] them that is leading them to do rights
[2:03:44] they know what happened to us come on
[2:03:47] come on until I got the power of the Sun
[2:03:49] in me I didn't make good choices
[2:03:53] I didn't do the right thing I ran from
[2:03:56] God I fought and kicked against
[2:03:57] everybody that he replaced
[2:04:00] but when it said he was flashing red
[2:04:02] lights you know what I'd look back in my
[2:04:04] life and I see flashing red lights all
[2:04:07] along the way
[2:04:08] but you know what I come to find out
[2:04:11] that once I welcome the power of the Sun
[2:04:14] in my life the red lights went away and
[2:04:16] now they're green light as I'm running
[2:04:19] for the Lord
[2:04:23] and I'm here to tell you
[2:04:25] you don't have to sin
[2:04:28] to be a son of God
[2:04:30] to be a daughter of God
[2:04:32] somebody tell me one time they talked
[2:04:34] about mother Ron they talked about his
[2:04:36] testimony through the fire and they said
[2:04:38] oh I want that testimony I said I don't
[2:04:40] want that testimony
[2:04:41] praise God for his testimony but I don't
[2:04:44] want to burn like that
[2:04:46] come on Church
[2:04:48] come on Church
[2:04:50] young people goes well I want some great
[2:04:52] testimony that's the greatest testimony
[2:04:55] the greatest testimony that a young
[2:04:58] person could say
[2:05:00] come on
[2:05:01] it's to stand up before their peers
[2:05:03] before young people and say you know
[2:05:05] y'all all talk about that but let me
[2:05:08] tell you about one come on church let me
[2:05:11] tell you about one that when the Devil
[2:05:13] Comes attempted to be this move there
[2:05:15] was one inside of me that said that
[2:05:17] ain't for you and I just destroyed at
[2:05:20] that devil I would stood that Temptation
[2:05:22] and I stood on the word of God and God
[2:05:25] did that why the power
[2:05:27] of the Sun
[2:05:29] oh but you're just a child you know God
[2:05:32] loves using children
[2:05:34] come on
[2:05:35] come on there's more examples of young
[2:05:38] kings and prophets in the bible than
[2:05:40] there are old ones typically the old
[2:05:42] ones are set in their ways like so
[2:05:45] come on Church
[2:05:46] typically the old ones that are in this
[2:05:48] scripture are like oh and they're
[2:05:50] sitting in their ways and they got it
[2:05:52] figured out themselves and they don't
[2:05:53] need the power of the son because they
[2:05:55] got it all in control
[2:05:57] and then here comes a little young boy
[2:05:59] called Dave
[2:06:00] come on
[2:06:02] it's a whole David it says Dave
[2:06:06] you're gonna be the king
[2:06:09] Saul can't even listen to the word of
[2:06:10] God anymore come on Church
[2:06:12] that's what's wrong with a lot of our
[2:06:14] old people in the message we send around
[2:06:16] message views all my life and we've got
[2:06:18] it figured out who's going to be the
[2:06:20] next Pastor who's going to be the next
[2:06:21] song who's going to be the next preacher
[2:06:23] and we're not allowing God to move in
[2:06:25] our lives
[2:06:26] cause we got it all figured out well you
[2:06:29] don't understand I've been in the
[2:06:30] message 50 years I don't care
[2:06:33] has the message been in you
[2:06:35] come on
[2:06:36] come on show
[2:06:39] your son or daughter of God that that
[2:06:41] power of the son that message has been
[2:06:44] inside of them and I'll show you one
[2:06:46] with humility I'll show you one with
[2:06:49] power I'll show you one with strength
[2:06:51] I'll show you one that has an overcoming
[2:06:53] life I'll show you true victory
[2:06:57] because it don't matter who the next
[2:06:58] faster is they're going to serve God
[2:07:00] anyway come on it don't matter what the
[2:07:02] song witness says they're going to serve
[2:07:04] God anyway
[2:07:06] look
[2:07:08] I don't know why people are people
[2:07:11] God allows us to be ourselves so much
[2:07:15] that we get out of the will of God
[2:07:17] we get a man to come up here and start
[2:07:19] to pray
[2:07:20] any any fumbles over his word and we
[2:07:22] think that he's out of the anointing
[2:07:25] what if he's in the annoying
[2:07:27] come on Church
[2:07:29] we take a preacher or we take brother to
[2:07:31] come up here and begin to teach and he
[2:07:33] loses his train of thought and we start
[2:07:35] thinking oh he didn't pray enough well
[2:07:37] what if he did
[2:07:38] what if that's God choosing him to enter
[2:07:41] himself so that God can speak what he
[2:07:44] wants to speak to you come on I can
[2:07:46] study 12 hours a day seven days a week
[2:07:48] have exactly what I was going to preach
[2:07:50] to you at midnight last night and at 10
[2:07:53] 30 this morning God said no go this way
[2:07:56] come on charge
[2:07:58] come on maybe that's why I ain't
[2:08:00] following the notes because I don't have
[2:08:01] much
[2:08:02] but God said go this way and if I'm
[2:08:05] going to go that way if I'm going to be
[2:08:07] obedient to God it's greater for me to
[2:08:10] get out of the way and say God speaks
[2:08:13] something to your people this morning
[2:08:14] let them know it's not my fireworks but
[2:08:18] it's by his words through you
[2:08:22] come on Church
[2:08:24] oh my
[2:08:28] beloved your election of God for a
[2:08:30] gospel come not unto you by word only
[2:08:32] but also in power and in the Holy Ghost
[2:08:35] and in most Assurance as you know what
[2:08:38] men are men we are among you for your
[2:08:40] sake and you become followers of us and
[2:08:42] of the Lord having received the word and
[2:08:45] much Affliction with the joy of the Holy
[2:08:48] Ghost
[2:08:49] all right so we're gonna stop there for
[2:08:50] a minute
[2:08:51] I'll look around the world and I see a
[2:08:53] bride that's walking around like this
[2:08:55] come on I have yet to be to a wedding in
[2:08:59] the natural
[2:09:00] that the bride didn't know she was the
[2:09:02] center point of attention
[2:09:04] come on they even get drama about it
[2:09:07] I'm you gonna wait on them
[2:09:11] didn't put that day
[2:09:13] they ain't gonna get out of the chair
[2:09:16] if they need something to drink one of
[2:09:17] the bridesmaid's gonna go get them a
[2:09:18] drink it's gonna run it over to them
[2:09:21] come on you know
[2:09:23] and you should because that's the
[2:09:24] bride's day that's her day that's her
[2:09:27] single day that everything is about her
[2:09:31] sorry man it ain't about you it's about
[2:09:33] her
[2:09:34] you're just a lucky one that gets to
[2:09:36] participate in the ceremony
[2:09:38] it's about the bride
[2:09:41] if the bride's shoes are two types
[2:09:43] somebody's going to Walmart to buy some
[2:09:44] more
[2:09:45] come on no holds bar whatever the bride
[2:09:48] wants to buy a kids
[2:09:50] come on Church
[2:09:52] you're the bride of Christ
[2:09:54] whatever you want you get
[2:09:56] you need to start living that way you
[2:09:59] need to get your face up off the ground
[2:10:00] you need to pick your head up throw your
[2:10:03] shoulders back let the world know I'm
[2:10:05] the bride of Christ if you want to be a
[2:10:07] part of me then you've got to be born
[2:10:09] again
[2:10:12] I saw a sign the other day coming to my
[2:10:14] head I'll share it with you I saw a sign
[2:10:16] the other day talking about all these
[2:10:18] perversion in this world that well I
[2:10:20] never was a boy I was a girl you liar
[2:10:23] he was a boy when he was born
[2:10:25] it's Church signed they posted a church
[2:10:27] sign and they said if you didn't like
[2:10:28] your first balloon try getting born
[2:10:30] again
[2:10:31] come on
[2:10:32] try getting born again
[2:10:34] because Jesus says You must be born
[2:10:36] again
[2:10:37] you take that perversion attitude you
[2:10:39] take that perversion spirit that is all
[2:10:41] over this world you get them born again
[2:10:43] they won't let there know whether
[2:10:45] they're a boy or a girl they're no
[2:10:47] they're a Son of God they're a daughter
[2:10:48] of God why because something the power
[2:10:51] of this certain reflects in that life
[2:10:54] takes the perversion out of their head
[2:10:57] I would have never did that that yeah
[2:11:00] you would have
[2:11:01] come on if it wasn't for the power of
[2:11:03] the Sun
[2:11:04] where would we be today
[2:11:06] come on children of God don't get so
[2:11:09] high-minded that you think that you're
[2:11:10] impossible to be tricked that you're
[2:11:12] impossible where the scripture said that
[2:11:14] the broadcast can't be deceived amen
[2:11:17] but it didn't say you wouldn't fight you
[2:11:19] way all the way there
[2:11:21] come on church we need to learn humility
[2:11:24] in strength come on humidity ain't just
[2:11:27] laying down and letting the dogs kick
[2:11:28] you humility ain't just walking around
[2:11:30] with your head down oh I'm just no no
[2:11:32] humility is when Jesus Christ stood out
[2:11:35] on the wall he stood out upon the
[2:11:37] Mountaintop and he began to preach to
[2:11:38] him he was humble man but yet what he
[2:11:41] would do he would look to him and he
[2:11:42] says but if you don't eat my flesh and
[2:11:44] drink my blood you have no part in me
[2:11:46] and they said oh that's not humility oh
[2:11:49] it's humility he just recognized who he
[2:11:51] was he just recognized the truth that
[2:11:54] without the power of the son you have no
[2:11:57] option to Victory you have no way to
[2:12:00] overcome it you have no way to a joyous
[2:12:02] life but if you'll realize that and you
[2:12:05] step back and say he's speaking to me
[2:12:09] he's speaking to me and I want the power
[2:12:13] of the son so I'm going to take the book
[2:12:15] and I'm going to eat the book because
[2:12:17] the word of God is the Flesh of Christ
[2:12:19] come on
[2:12:22] and I'm gonna allow that power
[2:12:24] to live
[2:12:25] in me
[2:12:27] he said you become followers of us in
[2:12:29] the Lord having received the word and so
[2:12:30] much Affliction with the joy
[2:12:33] of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:35] some of us need some jewelry restored
[2:12:38] come on Church
[2:12:39] some of us this morning that you raise
[2:12:41] our hands and say God restore unto me
[2:12:43] the joy
[2:12:45] of thy salvation Lord make me like I was
[2:12:48] that night I come off the altar toward
[2:12:50] nothing in the world mattered anymore
[2:12:52] the house payment didn't matter the car
[2:12:54] payment didn't matter what I drove
[2:12:56] didn't matter what my friends said
[2:12:58] didn't matter what the world said didn't
[2:13:01] matter all that mattered was I was in
[2:13:03] communication with you and the world
[2:13:05] could do what they wanted to do but I
[2:13:07] knew I wasn't right
[2:13:14] not really but he is good
[2:13:17] because he sets forth tactics
[2:13:19] to get everybody to fight amongst
[2:13:22] themselves
[2:13:25] and he's sitting over in the corner
[2:13:27] with his foot propped up
[2:13:30] going
[2:13:32] there ain't nobody hitting me with an
[2:13:34] uppercut in two years
[2:13:36] because they're too worried about their
[2:13:37] brothers and their sisters
[2:13:39] come on Church
[2:13:41] could you imagine
[2:13:43] when he or Seymour happened and they
[2:13:45] sent all of them fighter jets over there
[2:13:47] to drop that bomb
[2:13:49] if two or three of them Pilots would
[2:13:50] have started fussing amongst themselves
[2:13:53] about where the bombs should go
[2:13:55] and this and says it should have went
[2:13:57] there and this and says it should have
[2:13:58] been there and this and said No it
[2:14:00] should have been this court and vision
[2:14:01] said no it wasn't at the river and this
[2:14:03] it said oh the cloud wasn't true come on
[2:14:07] and they began to argue in their self
[2:14:09] the bomb would have dropped harmlessly
[2:14:11] out in the middle of the Pacific
[2:14:14] come on
[2:14:16] and in Japan would have knew that
[2:14:17] America was after them and then Japan
[2:14:19] wanted to be fortified their defenses
[2:14:22] and they would have been ready for the
[2:14:23] attack
[2:14:24] but see they went with one common goal
[2:14:29] come on Church they went with one common
[2:14:32] goal the power of the sun and the power
[2:14:35] of the sun was a general sitting on the
[2:14:37] couch and the general sitting on the
[2:14:39] capitol John had the plans figured out
[2:14:41] and nobody was there to argue with him
[2:14:43] because he had the final say come on God
[2:14:47] he's got the final say he done got your
[2:14:50] War plan figured out he's done got you
[2:14:53] in and he figured out he doesn't know
[2:14:54] it's where to attack that devil he don't
[2:14:57] need you to change the coordinates
[2:15:00] he needs you to be a good pilot and hold
[2:15:03] the sticks and say okay there's the
[2:15:06] coordinates I'll just push the button
[2:15:09] come on Church
[2:15:10] that's
[2:15:12] I need you and I to do you don't need us
[2:15:14] to argue with his word he don't need us
[2:15:16] to argue with one another when I think
[2:15:19] that we should conduct church this way
[2:15:20] I'm about to get to something
[2:15:22] come on church I think that we should
[2:15:24] conduct this church this way because
[2:15:26] brother said do it this way and I think
[2:15:28] when I think that he meant this way and
[2:15:32] the devil's sitting back there going I
[2:15:34] got him again
[2:15:37] do what he needs us to do it's the God
[2:15:40] how do you want the church
[2:15:42] to be done you know what God says he put
[2:15:45] it in his scripture he says I elect
[2:15:47] pastors to be over the church come on
[2:15:50] Church you agree with this just say amen
[2:15:53] I elect pastors to support provide over
[2:15:56] the church and give them what they have
[2:15:58] made of
[2:15:59] I was at a church one time and and the
[2:16:01] pastor had had preached three services
[2:16:03] in a woe about women cutting their hair
[2:16:08] come with me
[2:16:10] you know oh Mr better than you
[2:16:13] I don't know what the pastor's thinking
[2:16:15] there ain't a single sister in our
[2:16:17] church that's cut their hair
[2:16:19] I said well what if the enemy's talking
[2:16:21] to him
[2:16:22] come on church and you can't see that
[2:16:25] you don't know the Warfare the spiritual
[2:16:28] warfare that is going on in the church
[2:16:31] but the pastor's subject to getting
[2:16:33] himself away and God has revealed to him
[2:16:36] what the church is finding
[2:16:39] just because you hadn't done it don't
[2:16:41] mean you ain't fighting it
[2:16:45] he looked at me and he says you really
[2:16:47] think so and I said oh I really think so
[2:16:50] I really think so I really believe that
[2:16:53] God uses pastors to hit his spirits
[2:16:56] before it manifestes itself
[2:16:58] see that's the power of the Sun
[2:17:01] the power of the sun gives a minister
[2:17:04] ability to root out that devil
[2:17:07] come on
[2:17:10] to root out that devil before it even
[2:17:12] manifestes itself
[2:17:14] see we've got something on the devil
[2:17:16] that he don't have on us
[2:17:19] the devil don't know what we're thinking
[2:17:20] until we say it
[2:17:22] come on
[2:17:24] brother Brown said that we can go find
[2:17:26] the quote right past if you need me to
[2:17:27] brother Brandon said that
[2:17:29] brother Brown says I won't say things
[2:17:32] sometimes or even talk about what I'm
[2:17:35] going to preach because until I say it
[2:17:38] the devil don't know what I'm thinking
[2:17:40] come on Church
[2:17:42] but see our God he already knows what
[2:17:45] the devil's thinking he's already
[2:17:47] pre-planned an overcoming power in your
[2:17:50] life through the power of the sun before
[2:17:54] the devil even attacks you
[2:17:58] well I'm just going to wait and see well
[2:18:00] I guess we're gonna have an all-night
[2:18:02] prayer meeting and get you back in line
[2:18:04] because if you're just going to wait and
[2:18:06] see the time you see what's going on
[2:18:08] it's too late
[2:18:10] but time you see what's going on that
[2:18:13] demon has already took control of your
[2:18:14] body that Spirit has done took control
[2:18:17] of your soul come on that perverted
[2:18:20] thought has done took control of your
[2:18:22] mind and now you have no power over it
[2:18:24] so now you need an old-fashioned prayer
[2:18:27] meeting because you need children of God
[2:18:29] to get around you and lay hand upon you
[2:18:31] and pray the power of the son from the
[2:18:34] heavens into your life so that it can
[2:18:36] combat what you've allowed to come upon
[2:18:38] yourself
[2:18:40] I know that's really hard I don't like
[2:18:42] being hard y'all forgive me
[2:18:44] [Music]
[2:18:45] but I'm not sorry
[2:18:47] because you know what
[2:18:49] that's how he attacks
[2:18:51] you off by yourself
[2:18:53] come on
[2:18:55] he gets you driving down the road by
[2:18:57] yourself
[2:18:58] and instead of turning the tape on you
[2:19:00] turn country music on
[2:19:01] come on
[2:19:03] oh man
[2:19:04] I have to do that
[2:19:06] come Church
[2:19:09] instead of turning a good gospel song on
[2:19:12] you turned 99-7 on and listened to
[2:19:15] the politics of the world come on Church
[2:19:19] come on and it begins to influence you
[2:19:22] and next thing you know you start
[2:19:23] agreeing with everything they're saying
[2:19:25] well you know what I think that guy's
[2:19:27] right
[2:19:29] yeah he's right all right in his own
[2:19:32] mind
[2:19:33] come on
[2:19:34] come on y'all know the scripture
[2:19:39] but if we could get away
[2:19:41] and say God
[2:19:43] maybe I'll just shut the radio off
[2:19:45] completely
[2:19:47] I'll just invite you to come down
[2:19:48] brother Carol used to say he'd reach
[2:19:50] over and dust the seat off on the
[2:19:52] passenger side
[2:19:53] and they say God won't you come ride
[2:19:55] with me
[2:19:56] won't you come sit in this seat
[2:19:59] if you got anything you'd like to tell
[2:20:00] me I'll just sit here listen
[2:20:04] yeah some of the best times in my life
[2:20:06] is riding down the road
[2:20:08] when I accidentally leave my cell phone
[2:20:10] at home
[2:20:13] I tell myself the radio don't work
[2:20:15] and I just ride
[2:20:18] with the power
[2:20:19] of the Sun
[2:20:21] setting beside me
[2:20:26] he begins to talk to me
[2:20:28] he begins to go you know what Jonathan
[2:20:31] if you're not careful
[2:20:32] you're going to let that little thing
[2:20:34] take over in your life
[2:20:36] Jonathan it may not be much now
[2:20:38] but if you keep going that way
[2:20:41] it'll take over in your life
[2:20:43] come on Church
[2:20:45] that's still a small voice begins to
[2:20:47] speak
[2:20:48] it begins to talk to our inner being
[2:20:50] what is that
[2:20:51] the power
[2:20:53] of the Sun
[2:20:55] it's beginning to fall back that coat
[2:20:57] and crusty heart he's beginning to stop
[2:20:59] back your own ideals
[2:21:01] what I think that I need to sit on the
[2:21:03] second row well maybe you need to sit on
[2:21:05] the front row ain't nobody up here
[2:21:08] maybe have a good opportunity
[2:21:10] come on Church
[2:21:12] come on
[2:21:13] you say go to message churches you got
[2:21:15] to get there early for a back row
[2:21:17] sorry
[2:21:21] brother Carol used to tell the people of
[2:21:23] the church when I was a little bit seven
[2:21:25] eight nine year old we had them some old
[2:21:27] videos now
[2:21:29] and you can almost see the smile on his
[2:21:31] face if we had a Nick on our finger we'd
[2:21:33] come up in the prayer line and get
[2:21:34] prayed for
[2:21:36] and some of the parents went to Brother
[2:21:38] Carol and told him since there's nothing
[2:21:40] wrong with them he says don't stop them
[2:21:43] he said they just
[2:21:45] like to feel the anointing of God
[2:21:48] come on Church
[2:21:49] maybe we need to feel the anointing of
[2:21:51] God more
[2:21:52] maybe we need to click holder to wish
[2:21:54] for it I'll come home church maybe we
[2:21:56] need to get in the anointing more maybe
[2:21:58] we need to get close to his presence
[2:22:00] more than we ever have you realize this
[2:22:03] world has gone insane you realize it's a
[2:22:06] prophecy being fulfilled that these very
[2:22:08] things that are happening now are
[2:22:10] happening on purpose
[2:22:11] but at the same time he said there's
[2:22:14] going to be a bride that has the power
[2:22:17] of the sun inside of her that's going to
[2:22:19] draw closer than she's ever been come on
[2:22:23] Church there's going to be things start
[2:22:24] falling away that we used to not see not
[2:22:27] the other way around
[2:22:28] come on Church
[2:22:30] I know it gets kind of hard in the
[2:22:32] middle let's just bear through it
[2:22:39] come on Church
[2:22:41] this message is drawing us closer to God
[2:22:44] not farther away from God
[2:22:48] gave me the victory over tobacco I'm not
[2:22:51] going back to tobacco
[2:22:53] God then gave me victory over alcohol
[2:22:55] I'm not going back to alcohol if God
[2:22:57] then gave me the victory of how I speak
[2:22:59] I'm not going back to the way I used to
[2:23:02] speak if God done gave me the victory of
[2:23:04] a sorry rotten attitude I'm not going
[2:23:07] back to a sorry rotten attitude God's
[2:23:10] gave me the victory over them I'm moving
[2:23:13] forward with him
[2:23:19] with the joy
[2:23:21] of the Holy Ghost he said so that's you
[2:23:23] or your samples to all that believe
[2:23:26] in the message alone
[2:23:29] in 1964 brother says like a little story
[2:23:32] I was reading the other morning a woman
[2:23:34] hollered to her husband who had got up
[2:23:36] early and went out to the morning paper
[2:23:38] and was reading the morning paper
[2:23:40] he said or she said is there anything in
[2:23:42] you in the news
[2:23:44] he said no just the same thing only
[2:23:47] different people
[2:23:49] boy if that ain't the truth
[2:23:50] I mean come on
[2:23:52] you ever read the newspaper found
[2:23:54] anything new
[2:23:55] it's just somebody else killed somebody
[2:23:57] else's brother but they still kill him
[2:23:59] and Robin
[2:24:00] he said oh no nothing new just say Mom
[2:24:02] same thing just different people he said
[2:24:04] that's about the way it is today the
[2:24:06] same thing he says we've got a new
[2:24:08] organization but the same old Doctrine
[2:24:10] come on church we got a new organization
[2:24:13] but the same old Doctrine he just patted
[2:24:15] around somebody's a little
[2:24:20] he's a big
[2:24:22] going this way or that way come on to
[2:24:24] her sit back and watch us destroy
[2:24:26] ourselves
[2:24:29] come
[2:24:30] what did they say about America they
[2:24:32] said the only way that America would
[2:24:33] ever be overtook by enemy power is that
[2:24:36] she destroyed herself from inside
[2:24:39] well guess what she's doing that now
[2:24:42] I hate to be the bearer of bad news but
[2:24:44] this great country that it once was is
[2:24:47] now destroying herself from the inside
[2:24:50] come on Church
[2:24:52] but that's a tap from the natural to the
[2:24:55] spiritual the only way that you will be
[2:24:58] overcome by the end
[2:24:59] I mean is if you destroy yourself
[2:25:02] from inside this church
[2:25:04] come on you're members of this church
[2:25:06] this is your church you ought to be
[2:25:08] proud that this is your church
[2:25:10] you ought to stand for one another when
[2:25:13] you see a brother and sister in a battle
[2:25:15] you ought to hold them up in prayer come
[2:25:17] on church when you see a brother and
[2:25:19] sister not come to church you ought to
[2:25:21] pick up the phone and call them and make
[2:25:23] sure they're okay
[2:25:25] not assume the worst maybe their car
[2:25:27] broke down and they need somebody to
[2:25:29] help them come on
[2:25:31] we ought to be unified as a bride around
[2:25:33] the word of God around the power of the
[2:25:36] Sun and realize this is the way of the
[2:25:39] Lord
[2:25:40] this is how he ordained us it's to be a
[2:25:43] body to be a group if my finger hurts my
[2:25:46] body hurts if my brother hurts I hurt if
[2:25:50] my sister hurts I hurt and I want us to
[2:25:52] come together and say under the power of
[2:25:55] the Son of God I want us to rise up
[2:26:01] he says but this is a new day he said
[2:26:05] Hallelujah he said this is a day that we
[2:26:09] should rise and shine
[2:26:11] why because we see prophecy being
[2:26:13] fulfilled
[2:26:15] come on
[2:26:16] we here how many is listening to tapes
[2:26:18] We Believe brother Brennan was a Prophet
[2:26:20] come on we hear what he said would
[2:26:23] happen in the end time right now it's
[2:26:26] happening in front of our eyes
[2:26:29] and so we see it happening and we
[2:26:32] realize it isn't me but it's him living
[2:26:35] in me that now I can be happy
[2:26:39] oh but you don't know man this War I
[2:26:44] tell you what what was it six months ago
[2:26:46] we all thought we was dead because
[2:26:47] Russia was going
[2:26:50] to come down on Ukraine I don't know
[2:26:52] what's going on
[2:26:54] I don't live over there I don't know
[2:26:55] what's going on
[2:26:57] but you know what that doesn't affect me
[2:26:59] come on church that doesn't affect the
[2:27:02] bride
[2:27:03] they can do whatever they want to over
[2:27:05] there and as long as you got your eyes
[2:27:07] upon the word you
[2:27:09] going home before the first bomb drops
[2:27:12] come we have a promise we have an
[2:27:15] example we have the power of the sun on
[2:27:17] our side that we cannot be defeated that
[2:27:21] we cannot be overcome that he's here to
[2:27:24] take his bride home
[2:27:26] but we got to get our eyes
[2:27:28] off of everything else
[2:27:30] and focus upon him
[2:27:32] he said this is a new day we should rise
[2:27:35] and shine in the power of Jesus Christ
[2:27:39] it's a gross Darkness standing upon the
[2:27:42] Earth he said there should be a new day
[2:27:44] for us he said yes indeed doing it the
[2:27:47] way he does but turn to his word and see
[2:27:50] the Promise
[2:27:53] come on
[2:27:54] what do you think little David did they
[2:27:57] returned to the word and says there
[2:27:58] shall be no enemy come against thee
[2:28:00] he goes oh wait gloss and anything if
[2:28:04] the word says there's no enemy to come
[2:28:05] against me I'm not worried about it
[2:28:07] come on Church
[2:28:09] he had the power of the sun you got the
[2:28:11] power of the sun when depression sets in
[2:28:13] in your life come on church when
[2:28:15] sickness sets in in your life when
[2:28:17] darkness overshadows your heart when
[2:28:19] anxiety comes upon your life you have
[2:28:22] the power of the son when the scripture
[2:28:25] says no weapon can be formed against you
[2:28:28] it wasn't just talking about guns and
[2:28:30] knives he was talking about spiritual
[2:28:32] warfare that we're fighting in a
[2:28:35] spiritual battle today that there's no
[2:28:37] weapon can be formed against you there's
[2:28:39] no anxiety that can be formed against
[2:28:41] you there's no depression that can be
[2:28:43] formed against you there's no temptation
[2:28:45] that can be formed against you that the
[2:28:47] power of the sun cannot get rid of
[2:28:51] but turn to his word see the Promise
[2:28:54] that's promised for this day and you'll
[2:28:57] know that you're living in this day
[2:29:00] come on I get excited when I see the
[2:29:03] world falling apart
[2:29:04] call me an idiot if you want to call me
[2:29:06] a Holy Roller if you want to
[2:29:09] but I start praising his name when I see
[2:29:12] politics fall into the Wayside well I
[2:29:14] see him wanting to vote and take the Ten
[2:29:16] Commandments out of the Capitol building
[2:29:18] I see it let me do I praise God we're a
[2:29:21] step closer to going home because when
[2:29:23] the world takes their eyes off of God
[2:29:25] that's when the bride's going to slip
[2:29:27] right on out of here because she's going
[2:29:28] to be looking into the word
[2:29:31] you realize
[2:29:34] that's why the world's not even going to
[2:29:36] know you're gone
[2:29:38] because the world's going to be too busy
[2:29:40] looking at their ideals
[2:29:42] and they're not going to be looking at
[2:29:43] the word
[2:29:44] they're not going to be looking oh
[2:29:45] they're still going to go to church
[2:29:47] but come on let's be honest do they
[2:29:49] really worship God in church anymore
[2:29:51] brother Brennan said they worshiped the
[2:29:53] devil and don't even know it
[2:29:55] come on church that's what he said I've
[2:29:58] got it if you need it
[2:30:00] they worship the devil and they don't
[2:30:03] even know it
[2:30:04] come on there's a message churches that
[2:30:08] are worshiping the devil and don't even
[2:30:10] know it because of men's Creeds because
[2:30:13] of man's ideals
[2:30:14] they want to put that man above that man
[2:30:17] that's the devil
[2:30:19] because that's the same thing they did
[2:30:21] in scripture in Daniel when they created
[2:30:25] a golden image of Bill's above and they
[2:30:27] said you know what that is the image of
[2:30:29] Daniel the Prophet
[2:30:32] you know that I don't just own scripture
[2:30:35] they created an image of the prophet and
[2:30:38] they wanted anybody to bow to the
[2:30:40] prophet but that Prophet had been
[2:30:43] preaching in the land that you shall not
[2:30:45] send no Idols before God that you shall
[2:30:48] not say no men before God you worship
[2:30:51] only the God himself
[2:30:54] and thank God for little three young
[2:30:56] people
[2:30:57] come on
[2:30:59] Nick
[2:31:00] Shadrach and abednia probably 12 13 14
[2:31:04] year old
[2:31:05] they may have not knew their
[2:31:07] implications but they had heard the
[2:31:08] prophet's word come on they had heard
[2:31:10] the prophet preach and they knew they
[2:31:13] was not to bow to no image
[2:31:15] especially an image of the prophet
[2:31:19] but what have they done in our day
[2:31:22] I can go get it whether Brandon said the
[2:31:25] Gentile age was started out under man
[2:31:28] worship
[2:31:29] and it will go out under man worship and
[2:31:32] it's the prophet of that day they're
[2:31:34] trying to worship if that's what you're
[2:31:36] listening to you're listening to a
[2:31:38] perverted spirit
[2:31:39] because he would have never told you
[2:31:41] that
[2:31:42] he would have told you to worship him he
[2:31:45] would have told you to praise him he
[2:31:46] would have told you to worship the power
[2:31:48] of God that's living inside of you he
[2:31:50] would have told you greater is he that
[2:31:52] is in you than he that's in the world he
[2:31:55] would have told you the same holy ghost
[2:31:57] that I'm feeling you need to fill in
[2:32:00] your life the same Holy Ghost that's
[2:32:02] leading me needs to lead you in your
[2:32:04] life
[2:32:09] amen
[2:32:12] it is the rising of the Sun 1965.
[2:32:15] he said no matter here I am I told you I
[2:32:18] was getting somewhere
[2:32:20] I pulled this this morning
[2:32:22] he said no matter how many theologians
[2:32:25] claim
[2:32:26] how well you got your church set up
[2:32:30] let's message theologians in this
[2:32:32] message too
[2:32:33] well I think we need to do the prayer
[2:32:35] first and we need to do this you know
[2:32:36] what I think when he let the pastor set
[2:32:38] the order of the church
[2:32:39] because that's what scripture does
[2:32:43] no matter how many how much theologians
[2:32:46] claim how well you've got your church
[2:32:48] sent
[2:32:50] how much education you got
[2:32:52] how much like the Bible you have it
[2:32:55] until the wave Chief until the Holy
[2:32:57] Spirit comes upon that person to Quicken
[2:33:00] the word
[2:33:02] the gasoline represents the word it's
[2:33:04] the truth but without the spirit it
[2:33:07] won't move
[2:33:08] how many's heard the scripture the
[2:33:10] letter killeth
[2:33:12] Spirit giveth love
[2:33:14] come on
[2:33:16] in this message I'm not through beating
[2:33:18] on denominations I think our Prophet did
[2:33:20] that enough
[2:33:21] I'm gonna start beating on some message
[2:33:23] people
[2:33:24] in this message we've got it so
[2:33:26] perverted out with the word
[2:33:29] that we don't let God move in our
[2:33:30] churches no more
[2:33:32] come on Church
[2:33:34] we think that every Minister that gets
[2:33:36] up out of where his eye certainly
[2:33:39] some people even thinks you can't have
[2:33:40] court sleeves
[2:33:42] come on
[2:33:44] I'm just speaking truth and y'all know
[2:33:45] it
[2:33:47] they think they've got it all figured
[2:33:49] out and they don't even let God move in
[2:33:50] the church
[2:33:53] come on Church
[2:33:55] what if God wants some praise this
[2:33:56] morning
[2:33:57] are we willing to forget about
[2:33:58] everything else and just Praise Him
[2:34:01] we're willing to say God you're worthy
[2:34:03] of our praise
[2:34:04] God you're worthy of my hand being up
[2:34:06] you're worthy for me to say Amen you're
[2:34:09] worthy for me to praise you this morning
[2:34:14] he said we have too much stress
[2:34:16] on the mechanics
[2:34:18] and nothing on the Dynamics
[2:34:21] said it needs the dynamic power of God
[2:34:24] the resurrection power of Christ Jesus
[2:34:27] upon the
[2:34:28] manifest and bring it to pass this is
[2:34:31] the gasoline
[2:34:32] it might be in a gasoline can
[2:34:36] and it could still be water
[2:34:39] see but the only proof of it is is put
[2:34:42] this life on it and it'll prove whether
[2:34:45] it's gasoline or not
[2:34:47] put it in a gasoline pill all you want
[2:34:49] to you throw it on a fire and it puts
[2:34:50] the fire out
[2:34:52] he wasn't gasoline
[2:34:54] that's what happens in our churches
[2:34:57] we walk around and say we got the Holy
[2:34:58] Ghost but when the Holy Ghost starts
[2:35:00] moving we put a little ourself on and we
[2:35:02] put the flame out
[2:35:04] you didn't have the Holy Ghost
[2:35:06] because if you got the Holy Ghost your
[2:35:07] little lick will line up with your
[2:35:09] little dick without up with your little
[2:35:11] leg the next thing you know we got a
[2:35:13] bonfire
[2:35:15] next thing you know we got a fire that
[2:35:16] the devil don't know what to do with
[2:35:18] next thing you know we gonna come
[2:35:20] together under the power of the sun we
[2:35:22] all take out a little leak of fire we
[2:35:24] put it to the well we lay our shoulder
[2:35:26] to the wheel and we say I'm pressing for
[2:35:28] something to happen this morning
[2:35:31] and God sits back and goes I'm about to
[2:35:33] come down and show you a thing or two
[2:35:35] because I'm about to manifest myself in
[2:35:37] you because you are a representation
[2:35:41] of the power
[2:35:42] of my life
[2:35:44] too many Treasures
[2:35:46] well I think sister so-and-so gets out
[2:35:48] of order
[2:35:50] well you know if you get out of order
[2:35:51] sometime you might get out overmore
[2:35:53] because sister
[2:35:55] also just got blessed come on Church
[2:35:58] sister so-and-so couldn't contain
[2:36:00] herself because she's been in a battle
[2:36:02] all week she's been fighting all week
[2:36:04] the devil was at our front door the
[2:36:06] devil was trying to take her child the
[2:36:08] devil was trying to take her hell she'd
[2:36:10] been battling all week and God just made
[2:36:12] her sit by himself will to her she he
[2:36:14] couldn't contain her Joy
[2:36:19] and brother Brown said that too said
[2:36:21] sometimes getting that order might be a
[2:36:22] good thing
[2:36:24] I'm just talking with your prophet
[2:36:28] and when you try to put the holy spirit
[2:36:31] in demonstration
[2:36:32] as much as you're trying you can get a
[2:36:35] sputter
[2:36:36] but you'll run you'll ruin the engine
[2:36:39] by giving it full of carbon
[2:36:41] come on Church some of you is mechanics
[2:36:43] some of you knows a little bit
[2:36:46] if I pour five gallons of gasoline in
[2:36:48] the carburetor of that old 77 jug
[2:36:51] it ain't gonna run
[2:36:54] it ain't gonna run y'all it's called
[2:36:56] flooding it out
[2:36:58] and you didn't flooded it out because
[2:36:59] you didn't have no mechanics to go with
[2:37:01] you
[2:37:02] Dynamics come on Church
[2:37:05] you can go to these meetings I don't
[2:37:07] know why I'm on here y'all help me
[2:37:09] y'all the ones pulling
[2:37:11] you can go all of these meetings and you
[2:37:13] can run and shout all day long but if
[2:37:14] the word don't come forth it ain't done
[2:37:15] yet
[2:37:17] come on Church
[2:37:19] I'm not against the moving of the Holy
[2:37:21] Spirit but it's in unison with the
[2:37:23] mechanics and the Dynamics God laid an
[2:37:26] order to the church service to have the
[2:37:27] minister to bring forth the word to
[2:37:30] encourage to uplift to give you power
[2:37:33] power to give you strength to give you
[2:37:36] overcoming power to give you my faith
[2:37:39] that at the end of the servant you could
[2:37:40] raise up and say that ain't nothing but
[2:37:42] the truth I believe it and allow God to
[2:37:45] manifest itself with the spirit of the
[2:37:47] dynamic with the Holy Spirit in our
[2:37:49] lives
[2:37:52] we got to go one way or the other
[2:37:55] come on
[2:37:56] we either got to be just an all Shelton
[2:37:58] Church
[2:37:59] or a cold dead Church
[2:38:01] thank God we're not this way are we come
[2:38:04] on church this is God trying to warn
[2:38:06] somebody
[2:38:07] because somebody's fighting it this
[2:38:09] morning come on Church
[2:38:11] this is God trying to warn you stay with
[2:38:13] the word of God
[2:38:15] come on if somebody wants to worship and
[2:38:17] praise God let Him worship and praise
[2:38:19] God
[2:38:20] we was taught as a child when somebody
[2:38:22] started speaking in tongues you closed
[2:38:24] your eyes come on you don't look around
[2:38:26] and see what's happening you close your
[2:38:28] eyes and you maybe God might move upon
[2:38:31] you
[2:38:32] you know you know why it don't happen no
[2:38:33] more because when one person speaks in
[2:38:35] tongues the whole churches want to know
[2:38:36] what they're going to do
[2:38:39] come on
[2:38:42] amen I'll move on
[2:38:45] but oh I'm so glad brother Brandon says
[2:38:48] I'm so glad that there's ten thousand
[2:38:51] octane power the word of God in the Holy
[2:38:54] Ghost to light it up
[2:38:55] to resurrect the power of God in a man's
[2:38:58] life or a woman's or into a church they
[2:39:01] shove that Cadillac down the road
[2:39:03] younger and the dynamic power of the
[2:39:04] Holy Ghost which came back and was
[2:39:06] weighed over the people of this day of
[2:39:08] Pentecost making him the same yesterday
[2:39:10] today and forever that was the first
[2:39:13] sheep come up from all of the prophets
[2:39:15] which was the son of God it was the
[2:39:18] power of God when the outpouring
[2:39:20] happened on the day of Pentecost and
[2:39:22] they all began to speak in underturned
[2:39:24] that was the power of the Sun
[2:39:29] and in our day
[2:39:31] when you stand up against the walls of
[2:39:34] the enemy that is the power of the Sun
[2:39:37] when you go into your job place and they
[2:39:40] start speaking the evil of your lord and
[2:39:42] you won't have nothing to do with it
[2:39:43] that's the power of the sun when your
[2:39:46] life becomes a reflection of Christ
[2:39:48] whatever you know what they do around my
[2:39:50] word please when they start getting
[2:39:52] ready to tell a dirty joke they're
[2:39:53] asking me to leave
[2:39:54] I didn't tell him to ask me to leave but
[2:39:57] they see something represented inside of
[2:40:00] my life and it ain't just me it's you
[2:40:02] too they see something a power
[2:40:05] represented in your life that he don't
[2:40:07] want to hear that kind of nonsense then
[2:40:09] he don't want to hear that kind of talk
[2:40:11] we're going to ask him to leave thank
[2:40:13] God they respect that because I don't
[2:40:15] want to hear it
[2:40:16] come on Church
[2:40:18] but what is that that's the world seeing
[2:40:21] the power of the Sun in your life
[2:40:25] you walk up and it gets quiet well we
[2:40:28] don't have to put two and two
[2:40:29] together to figure out they wasn't
[2:40:31] talking about something about
[2:40:33] but you know what them same people do
[2:40:36] sick they want to get you off to the
[2:40:38] side
[2:40:39] come on
[2:40:40] because they see a representation of the
[2:40:42] Son of God in your life and they know
[2:40:45] that they know enough about scripture to
[2:40:47] know that when Jesus says Rise and be
[2:40:50] healed they Rose and be healed and they
[2:40:53] know that if you'll say that it'll
[2:40:55] happen to them
[2:40:58] talk about everything in the world
[2:41:01] him and his wife got into a fight
[2:41:03] they've been married 30 years
[2:41:05] he was afraid she was going to leave him
[2:41:08] he'd come in Jonathan I need to talk to
[2:41:09] you
[2:41:10] I said what's up
[2:41:11] okay
[2:41:14] sure let's go out of here this is what
[2:41:16] happened this is what happened this is
[2:41:17] what happened what do you think I should
[2:41:19] do
[2:41:20] I think you should go apologize
[2:41:22] huh yeah I think you should go apologize
[2:41:25] come on if you do something wrong you
[2:41:28] should apologize
[2:41:30] well well but but nothing
[2:41:34] if you want to save your marriage go
[2:41:36] apologize
[2:41:37] go tell her how you really feel about
[2:41:39] her come on Church
[2:41:41] go tell her how you really love her go
[2:41:43] tell her how you couldn't live without
[2:41:44] her go tell her how she she represents
[2:41:47] everything that you are go tell her that
[2:41:49] you did not mean to do that that some
[2:41:51] selfish idiotic desire come up on your
[2:41:54] mind and you did that but that ain't the
[2:41:55] real you
[2:41:58] two and a half weeks later he apologized
[2:42:04] two weeks later comes to business I
[2:42:06] don't think my marriage has ever been
[2:42:07] better
[2:42:08] come on Church
[2:42:10] come on Church
[2:42:12] if you're doing something wrong make it
[2:42:14] right
[2:42:15] if you said something to yourselves
[2:42:16] whether men may make it right
[2:42:19] I'm preaching on myself now baby I'm
[2:42:21] sorry whatever I did
[2:42:24] Lord help me
[2:42:30] that was the first Chief to come over
[2:42:31] all the prophets which was the Son of
[2:42:33] God the king of the prophets
[2:42:35] there's been churches churches Brides
[2:42:37] brides churches Brides brides but there
[2:42:40] has to come one
[2:42:43] he said Hallelujah he said there has to
[2:42:46] come a real Pride come on there's many
[2:42:49] mockeries and imputations that wanted to
[2:42:52] be the bride
[2:42:53] come on we can go to scripture we ain't
[2:42:54] got all day we're running out of time
[2:42:56] you can go to the 10 foolish versions
[2:42:58] there's ten of them there but there was
[2:43:00] only five that was Pride there was only
[2:43:02] five that was anointed there was only
[2:43:04] five that had the Holy Ghost with them
[2:43:05] there was only five that had the oil and
[2:43:07] the vessels it was prepared to go home
[2:43:10] with the crew the other five was
[2:43:12] intimidation on any intimidation but
[2:43:14] they was trying to be the likeness of
[2:43:15] the Bride they was trying to be the
[2:43:17] image of the Bride they dressed like the
[2:43:19] bride they acted like the bro they spoke
[2:43:22] like the bride but they didn't have the
[2:43:24] all come on Church brother said that all
[2:43:27] was the Holy Ghost they didn't have the
[2:43:30] Holy Ghost what did they not help they
[2:43:32] didn't have the power of the sun living
[2:43:35] in Elijah what did they do they went to
[2:43:37] slaves
[2:43:38] and the groom come
[2:43:41] and they got left
[2:43:43] because they didn't have
[2:43:46] power
[2:43:49] but brother Brennan says there has to
[2:43:51] come a real bride
[2:43:55] there must come one that's not only got
[2:43:57] the mechanics
[2:44:00] they got church order
[2:44:02] see just because you want to be all
[2:44:04] demanding don't mean to get away with
[2:44:05] church order come on Church
[2:44:08] he said oh we just let the Holy Ghost
[2:44:09] free in our life and you know what every
[2:44:11] time the preacher starts preaching
[2:44:12] somebody gets up and gives
[2:44:13] interpretation that's our church order
[2:44:16] that's not the Holy Spirit
[2:44:18] come on there's Church order in church
[2:44:21] when the words coming forth that's the
[2:44:23] most important thing
[2:44:25] that's why God intended it to be for the
[2:44:28] word to come forth to encourage to teach
[2:44:31] you up to give you something that you
[2:44:34] have need of
[2:44:37] you've got a word of Prophecy there's a
[2:44:39] place for that too it's not doing away
[2:44:41] with it he is putting it together
[2:44:44] in a perfect piece of cake
[2:44:46] the exact way that God wanted it he said
[2:44:49] but it's got to be a real bride there's
[2:44:50] must be one to come that's not only got
[2:44:53] the mechanics the church order but the
[2:44:55] Dynamics the Holy Spirit of it and it
[2:44:58] makes that church live
[2:45:01] come on Church
[2:45:03] come on you can't live under the
[2:45:05] mechanics only you can't live in a
[2:45:07] church order only and you're afraid to
[2:45:09] move everybody comes in like Sears and
[2:45:11] Roebuck they'll present it out here and
[2:45:14] gave you all the perfect suit and
[2:45:15] everybody comes in and I can't live on
[2:45:17] because I might wrinkle my shoulder and
[2:45:19] come on
[2:45:23] but it's in a perfect order
[2:45:25] of the mechanics
[2:45:27] and the Dynamics together it makes the
[2:45:29] church live
[2:45:31] it moves in the power of his
[2:45:34] resurrection
[2:45:35] until we come to that place until we
[2:45:38] find that place that what good does it
[2:45:40] do to polish the hubs what good does it
[2:45:43] do to give her a facelift or symbolize
[2:45:45] job when there's no Dynamics in it
[2:45:49] come on church I can have the most
[2:45:52] beautiful
[2:45:53] Mustang the world has ever seen
[2:45:57] but if I don't put a battery in gasoline
[2:45:59] in it don't mean nothing
[2:46:02] come on I can have a church that's
[2:46:05] perfect in church order
[2:46:08] and I can spit sign and polish the
[2:46:10] windows
[2:46:12] and I can vacuum the Pierce
[2:46:15] and I can part everybody's hair just
[2:46:17] right
[2:46:18] I can have two deacons stand at the back
[2:46:20] of each door and make sure everybody
[2:46:22] sits in the exact location
[2:46:25] to where we have assigned seats
[2:46:27] and we can have a church book in the
[2:46:29] back but you have to have your name in
[2:46:31] the book
[2:46:32] to be a part of the church
[2:46:34] come on Church
[2:46:36] but unless you let God move
[2:46:39] it's a dead Church
[2:46:41] it is nothing but a lodge and that's not
[2:46:44] denominations that's message
[2:46:46] if you don't let God move in your lives
[2:46:49] it's a dead Church
[2:46:51] he said no matter how much the mechanics
[2:46:54] prove to be right
[2:46:56] and five foolish
[2:46:58] they had the mechanics
[2:47:01] they knew how to live
[2:47:04] they knew how to talk
[2:47:06] they knew that the groom was coming
[2:47:10] they knew the end time signs that it was
[2:47:13] time for the groom to come
[2:47:14] they knew where to gather come on Church
[2:47:17] they was gathered with the wise versions
[2:47:21] they knew which church to go to
[2:47:24] come on Church
[2:47:26] they knew where the word of the Lord for
[2:47:28] their day was
[2:47:30] they knew who the prophet was
[2:47:32] they believed what the prophet said
[2:47:35] because they went and got a vessel
[2:47:38] just didn't have no oil in it
[2:47:42] and they showed up to church
[2:47:45] they knew
[2:47:46] the rapture was about to take place
[2:47:51] but they didn't have the power
[2:47:55] go on Church
[2:47:57] doesn't matter how much the mechanics
[2:47:59] proved to be right there's got to be
[2:48:01] Dynamics
[2:48:04] to make it work
[2:48:06] amen I'm going to skip some now
[2:48:09] I'm on close we can go down through
[2:48:11] every age but you know what
[2:48:14] it's our human instinct
[2:48:16] to look at the Mark and the mirror
[2:48:18] around us
[2:48:18] I found a picture one time and and I
[2:48:21] used it and I don't have the picture
[2:48:23] here
[2:48:24] you can Google it you can find it if you
[2:48:26] want to see it
[2:48:29] but the first picture is a picture of
[2:48:31] the sun setting in the sky
[2:48:34] and the second picture is the same
[2:48:36] picture but you can't see the sun all
[2:48:39] you can see is a man's thumb that's
[2:48:41] blocking the Sun
[2:48:43] and the question of the picture read
[2:48:46] which is bigger the thumb or the Sun
[2:48:50] come on Church
[2:48:52] obviously the sun's bigger
[2:48:56] he said but the problem is you're closer
[2:48:59] to the thumb
[2:49:01] than you are to the Sun
[2:49:02] and it makes the thumb look bigger
[2:49:05] come on Church
[2:49:07] that's what we do with our problems
[2:49:10] we're closer to our problems
[2:49:12] than we are to the power of the Sun
[2:49:15] or closer to our situation and some of
[2:49:18] us likes it too much
[2:49:20] come on Church
[2:49:22] come on
[2:49:23] some of us likes it too much
[2:49:25] and all we can see is all of the
[2:49:28] problems that we're facing come on
[2:49:30] Church
[2:49:32] but you know what you could take that
[2:49:33] same picture
[2:49:34] and all you have to do is take one step
[2:49:36] to the side
[2:49:38] and then it becomes obvious
[2:49:40] Sun blinds out the thumb
[2:49:43] the brightness of the sun you can't even
[2:49:46] see the man's thumb anymore
[2:49:49] church that's what I'm telling you this
[2:49:51] morning
[2:49:51] you got problems in your life you've got
[2:49:54] situations in your life you got milk and
[2:49:57] mud around and everybody wants to throw
[2:49:59] everything in the world pile it up but
[2:50:01] all I'm asking you this morning
[2:50:03] is take a step to the side
[2:50:05] get out of the mark
[2:50:07] get out of the mower get out of the
[2:50:09] critical Spirits get out of the bad
[2:50:11] attitudes get out of the how are better
[2:50:14] than me than you get it in the line with
[2:50:17] the Son of God get in line with the
[2:50:19] power of the Sun and you know what it'll
[2:50:21] take your eyes
[2:50:24] it's like welding how many of you has
[2:50:26] ever will put it before yeah you get
[2:50:29] your eyes burnt but that welder
[2:50:31] you're the only thing that'll help it
[2:50:34] look at it again
[2:50:36] but you know what happens it draws your
[2:50:38] eyes to it and you can't look away
[2:50:41] what do they say about a drunk driver
[2:50:42] the worst thing in the world to do to a
[2:50:44] drunk driver is less your bright lights
[2:50:46] at them
[2:50:47] because their attention goes to the
[2:50:49] bright light and they'll draw whatever
[2:50:50] in front of you
[2:50:52] come on children of God all we got to do
[2:50:54] is get a glimpse all we got to do is
[2:50:56] move just a little bit and get a glimpse
[2:50:59] of the power of God get a glimpse of the
[2:51:01] Sun get a glimpse of the power of the
[2:51:04] suit not God and to draw our attention
[2:51:07] straight to the word of God it'll draw
[2:51:10] our attention straight to the Son of God
[2:51:12] and we'll forget about the monk we'll
[2:51:15] forget about the trials we'll realize
[2:51:17] that's what Paul realized when he says I
[2:51:19] consider this as nothing
[2:51:21] compared to what is promised to me

[2:51:58] come on Church
[2:52:00] you know when I give my life to God
[2:52:01] everybody talked about me
[2:52:03] I was a heathen they thought I really
[2:52:06] wasn't I was the son of God
[2:52:08] but I was worshiping the wrong God I was
[2:52:11] worshiping the devil
[2:52:13] I'll run up and down the road with my
[2:52:14] Confederate flag in my
[2:52:16] rock and roll music come on
[2:52:19] I was a redneck out of you know
[2:52:22] but you know what when God got a hold of
[2:52:24] me
[2:52:25] things Begin to Fall Away
[2:52:28] rock and roll didn't mean so much no
[2:52:30] more
[2:52:31] come on Tobacco didn't mean so much no
[2:52:33] more alcohol didn't mean so much no more
[2:52:35] music didn't mean so much no more next
[2:52:38] thing you know they found me with the
[2:52:39] Bible in my hand
[2:52:40] you know when I was a teenager I didn't
[2:52:42] live for God and I'm sorry and I hate
[2:52:44] that and I asked God to forgive me every
[2:52:46] day for that
[2:52:47] but I never carried a Bible to church
[2:52:50] I don't ever go to church without a
[2:52:51] Bible now
[2:52:52] I mean thank God we got it on our
[2:52:54] tablets and our phones there ain't
[2:52:55] nothing like holding a book
[2:52:59] there ain't nothing like representing to
[2:53:01] the world I'm going to church this
[2:53:03] morning
[2:53:03] I'm not like the rest of the world
[2:53:05] carrying a foam in the church I've got
[2:53:07] the book I've got the word they don't
[2:53:10] have to worry because the book's laying
[2:53:11] on myself on my Dash when I get out they
[2:53:14] don't think I'm going to a a celebrity
[2:53:16] meeting or or a country club meeting
[2:53:19] they look real soon they can tell that
[2:53:20] boy was going to church
[2:53:23] there's a light
[2:53:25] as a representation
[2:53:27] to the world
[2:53:28] that the power
[2:53:30] of the sun is living
[2:53:33] in me
[2:53:35] and we're coming to that musicians come
[2:53:38] this morning
[2:53:40] we're coming to that place
[2:53:43] but I'm in the message why I talked
[2:53:45] about Moses we talked earlier
[2:53:49] and I know my redeemer liveth 1958 he's
[2:53:52] talking about Daniel I wanted to share
[2:53:54] this with you
[2:53:55] he said in Daniel not knowing how God
[2:53:58] was going to do it
[2:54:00] how many has ever been in a trial and
[2:54:01] you didn't know
[2:54:02] how God was going to bring you out of it
[2:54:05] see they told Daniel
[2:54:07] that if he kept
[2:54:10] they was going to put him in the lines
[2:54:11] then
[2:54:12] he knew what was coming
[2:54:14] come on
[2:54:16] he knew if he kept praying he was going
[2:54:18] to that Lion's Den
[2:54:20] he didn't know how he was going to get
[2:54:21] out of it but he knew he wasn't going to
[2:54:24] let
[2:54:25] the enemy
[2:54:27] Temple the power of the Sun
[2:54:30] Daniel not knowing how God was going to
[2:54:32] do and not knowing whether God was going
[2:54:34] to do it not knowing but knowing that he
[2:54:36] was able
[2:54:38] to do it knowing that something down in
[2:54:41] him told him so
[2:54:43] see God had a purpose he had everything
[2:54:45] working
[2:54:47] and after all and today no matter how
[2:54:50] indifferent we may seem at times how
[2:54:52] strange thing his goals of how the
[2:54:54] church gets in a condition in that
[2:54:56] condition it's all Divine Purpose of God
[2:55:01] to modus creator
[2:55:04] and the Lions could not eat that Prophet
[2:55:06] because God sent an angel and he had an
[2:55:09] angel standing prison take this Prophet
[2:55:12] because God had a purpose and he wanted
[2:55:16] to show that his self-styled King his
[2:55:18] mighty hand
[2:55:20] s for
[2:55:21] purpose
[2:55:22] he wanted to show the world
[2:55:26] that the power of the son
[2:55:29] was upon the Earth
[2:55:31] go on Church
[2:55:32] it's more than Daniel
[2:55:34] it's more than David

[2:55:39] the Bride come on church I'm bringing
[2:55:42] this right here to you now
[2:55:43] God has a purpose for your life
[2:55:47] each and every one of you God has a
[2:55:50] reason for the situation that you're in
[2:55:52] God has a purpose for the trial that
[2:55:55] you're battling God has a reason for the
[2:55:57] faith for the for the fight that you
[2:55:59] find yourself in the middle of
[2:56:01] what is it to show the world
[2:56:04] that the power of the son
[2:56:06] still upon the Earth
[2:56:08] it didn't lead when Jesus left
[2:56:11] Jesus says I'm going to die but in three
[2:56:13] days they'll raise me and I'm going to
[2:56:15] go and sit on the right hand of the
[2:56:16] throne but my spirit I will send back to
[2:56:20] you
[2:56:21] by to show the world that the power of
[2:56:24] the sun is still upon the Earth
[2:56:27] and brother said
[2:56:29] brother brother says and I think that's
[2:56:31] what's going on today that God is
[2:56:34] getting people ready
[2:56:38] that he can show his mighty hand to
[2:56:42] fulfill his mighty purpose
[2:56:45] he says oh I'm so glad this morning that
[2:56:49] he lives in my heart
[2:56:52] and that he's not a dead God that he's a
[2:56:55] living God and way down inside of me
[2:56:59] he's living this morning do you believe
[2:57:02] he's living in you this morning stand
[2:57:03] this morning
[2:57:05] are you glad he's not a dead God he's
[2:57:08] not a God that died upon a tree but
[2:57:10] there's an empty tomb and he sent his
[2:57:12] Spirit to you and I and there's more
[2:57:15] than being a bride than just saying you
[2:57:18] believe this Prophet there's more to
[2:57:20] being a bride than just saying you
[2:57:23] believe this message but you are now the
[2:57:26] representation
[2:57:28] of the power
[2:57:30] son amen you got a song We'll sing
[2:57:33] together he's alive and well amen you
