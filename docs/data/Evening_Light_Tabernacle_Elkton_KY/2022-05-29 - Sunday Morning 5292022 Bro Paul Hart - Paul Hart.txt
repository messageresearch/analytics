praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god amen if it wasn't for him amen glory to god where would we be amen you may be seated it's good to see everybody a man when brother byler was saying that there was only a few here i was like that's quite a bit hey man i'm just used to you know going and preaching to small groups and but uh we love the lord amen and we do trust them that wherever two or three is gathered and look i see more than three here hey man then yeah you know i don't think he has a choice he's got to be here amen and that's we do give god to thanks amen that he does come to visit us amen and to be with us to strengthen us and to give us the things that we need amen physically and spiritually amen he is truly faithful for that amen tell you what i need it you know you know there's been many times i used to say i'm just human i'm just human amen but you know i know there was a brother that kind of lectured me on that one time i was still young but i that's just how i always thought you know hey i'm just human i'm just human but you know some i'm just human but that is very true we are amen and uh but i believe we ought to look beyond that amen you know when you truly know what calvary really means amen let me tell you something you're a little bit more than human amen amen glory to god we we are we are those a man that can stand and and truly you know even look satan in the face and he could just vigil it right now you know we can say you know i've got a promise amen and it's a finished work glory to god amen and look and maybe the devil today just sees you as a human being in that flesh not perfect you know and that's very true but then the lord had given me a different insight amen he's giving me a different insight of i am you know who i really are amen i'm a part of the family of god amen i'm a child of god i'm a son of god amen glory and i have fallen air amen glory to god to these promises amen amen hello and and the satan's not stupid he knows you have amen but he knows the flesh amen he knows he can come around and you know and the support amen uh if i fall for it it's all it's my amen glory but i don't have to fall for it amen you know there's there's the psalms 22 amen but there's also psalms 23 right amen now if you go home and read psalms 22 you're gonna you're gonna read where david just felt miserable yeah i mean he you know he didn't know where to turn he just was down depressed and well you know he just didn't know what was going on i mean he was talking about how he was just so dried up you know and but look david you know when you get to the bottom of the verse you can see david was stepping into chapter 23 amen so you don't have to stay in chapter 22. you can you're entitled to it if you want to amen but you don't have to there's a chapter 23 amen glory for he is my shepherd i shall not want amen glory to god there's nothing this world can offer me amen once i met christ amen i know there's nothing out there i want amen glory to god and that's exactly how david felt amen look david had a kingdom that he could rule amen but that's not what he was looking at amen he had everything he had a palace he had a room that had all the treasures my think about that amen he could have never looked at those things and said what else could you know oh i'm sure the flesh could have thought of some things like there's a land over there i don't own yet i think i'll go over there and conquer it huh no but when he already see when he knew his god amen he could say the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want amen he i believe david when he stepped into chapter 23 he was satisfied amen he was content amen glory to god and we can do the same today amen amen yes we can there's a chapter 23 amen glory and i hope we've stepped into that this morning amen hallelujah glory but like i said you can stay in chapter 22 if you want amen that's completely all up to you amen glory but i'm encouraging you that there is a chapter 23 amen glory hallelujah i'm just going to share this song with you amen glory you know i'm just kind of uh something i'm sure brother byler knows and have experienced things like this you get behind the pulpit and you actually walked out of that office not knowing what to preach you just got to really rely on the lord amen that we can study we can put good notes together we can you know even place the quotes in there just just right you know the way you would want it and amen but look it all has to be by the inspiration of the holy spirit amen glory to god that he knows amen and so i was i was looking at different notes there i said lord i'm now i said what do i do now it's like i thought it was this i thought you know but anyway so i you know i had been reading on something that i you know as many times i've read scriptures now i'll be honest i've never really sat down and read the bible from genesis to revelation not like that but as many times you study or you know you just go to this place and that place that place and you probably read the whole bot but there are things in the bible you'll just read and says well ask them i didn't see that you know i know i've read this and it just it just happens that way and then when you come across it and the lord deals with your heart then you start the thinking and you start to looking at your own life and that's just the way he is sometimes but uh i know that this is a memorial weekend and and we we came here to most of my wife's family is here in kentucky and and so uh of course before when i first met my wife we would come here and actually visit family they were alive we could go to their house and you know just fellowship and it's like it's sad to say that now we come here and so we can kind of look at the graves you know and it's not really the way you want fellowship but it is it's been giving us a time to where you know this weekend we can just go around and have some memories you know and but uh anyway so we were just kind of looking at different things she still has family here and but the lord is good and i know that sometimes we were there i i didn't witness calvary amen you know and maybe it would have been uh something you know but i don't know you know but i just know i won there the god plays something in my heart that even though i just read it in a book but to me it's not a fairy tale it really did happen amen amen and i thank god that it did really happen amen glory to god because that was the only way for me amen if there was no calvary i don't know brothers and sisters amen glory to god but i'd like to share the song with you i never saw amen i didn't see it i didn't see the mob you know i didn't [Music] amen but i'm glad he rose amen glory i never saw the cross he carried up calvary's here i never saw the precious that cry let him be crucified no i never saw it but i believe for me he died he believed that amen [Music] i never saw the many i never saw the crown of thorns that my jesus wore no when i didn't see the lord he was crucified no i never saw it [Music] but i believed for me he died amen every step he took [Music] to calvary [Music] every drop of blood he shed he shed for me amen there's a lot of things [Applause] i cannot see but i believe when he died he died for me every step he took o glory [Music] to calvary every drop of blood he shed he shed for me [Music] there's a lot of things i cannot see [Music] but i believe when he died he died for me [Music] amen glory to god hallelujah praise god thank you brother praise the lord amen glory aren't you glad for that amen glory to god i believe jesus could have kept walking if he wanted to but i'm glad he stopped amen you know all through the bible jesus had always told them even the disciples that he was going to die amen he he had shared that with the disciples over and over even when he was you know you know and he he always had already told him he says i'm gonna die you know and he he's told him uh they're gonna come and take me and i'm going to suffer amen and he he shared that all the time you know he gave them that sign you know one day i'll be you know i'm going to die and even to the uh you know to the elders you know to those and he even told me he said you know you destroy this body and all he said destroy this temple and i'll build i'll raise it up in three days i mean he even witnessed to them of his own death of course they didn't understand it amen they said what do you mean he says it took years for us to build this temple you know and all of that and you mean you'll just you know we just destroy it you'll build it back up in three days of course he was talking about himself amen all through the scriptures you'll find how you know so you could see that jesus didn't fear death he didn't fear death i mean he told the disciples over and over even peter got a little upset one time when jesus was telling him and he says this can't be [Music] amen even jesus had to say satan get behind me amen but there he was you can see that he wasn't he didn't fear death that wasn't scaring him amen but you know there he was in the garden in agony praying to the father and and the bible talks about that his his sweat [Applause] was blood amen just dripping amen you could almost probably picture it in your own mind that if he was sweating so bad because you know but it wasn't the death that was carrying him it was because he knew amen that he was becoming sin amen he was had to take on your sin amen glory to god and he knew that there was going to be a point of time that he was going to be separated from the father that's what he didn't like he didn't fear death amen but to be separated from the father amen that's the part amen lord amen would this cup pass amen i mean all through his ministry he told them i'm gonna die i'm gonna die he wasn't afraid of that amen [Applause] but if even jesus amen glory to god didn't want that to happen how about us amen amen lord i don't i don't never want to lose amen i don't ever want to be separated from you amen glory and sometimes the people today you almost wonder hey man that they're doing the things that they're doing and it's like they don't know no worries of what they do knowing that the very things that that they do or what we do would separate us in and from that fellowship amen see jesus didn't want that he didn't want it so bad that he prayed in the garden that his own blood i mean the sweat that was coming out was blood just dripping down brother byler poppy when he was done praying he was probably covered with blood whatever garments he was wearing it was drenched in blood all because he knew amen glory to god but let me tell you something when he was hanging on the cross amen there was something happening amen what was going on he was becoming us as we were becoming him amen glory hallelujah amen think about it think about it amen as he was there amen he wasn't afraid to die but there was something that he didn't like at all and that was to be separated from the father amen glory and he said father he said god my god amen has forsaken me amen glory but there he was bearing the world sins amen on his shoulder he was becoming every sin out there amen glory and it was starting to separate him from the father amen glory and as you what's becoming him amen there you are becoming close to the father oh glory to god hallelujah something was happening on that day and maybe it happened more than 2 000 years ago but it happened amen and gave me the chance today amen to have that fellowship with my father amen glory as he was becoming me more than 2 000 years ago i'm becoming him amen glory hallelujah but he didn't fear that the death oh my sometimes we should think twice again when we do the things we do because i sometimes we don't know it and then sometimes you wonder why god feels a million miles away amen glory hallelujah you know i was reading something you just forgive me i sometimes i'm i'm like a baby amen glory and sometimes the tears is not because i'm sad it's just there's something within me that my glory hallelujah let's just stand for the reading of the word one of my i mean the whole bible's my favorite book but sometimes you'll get into a book and it's like oh my this is my favorite then you'll get in another book and says oh i thought that was my favorite my favorite you know but you just learned the whole book's your favorite amen and i like to read about joshua amen and and there's a lot of types in there man that you can really look at and but you know i come across a it's not i've never read it before but i just thought i'd read it again and it's joshua chapter 20. and there's only like nine verses and uh and i've read different scriptures of this especially in the book of numbers where it talks about the the city of refuge and so i was like you know even though i've read this i said well i've heard that i mean i've read that and i said but i've never really pursued to but just a couple weeks ago you know and i was just reading it and somehow the lord wanted to inspire me with it or i just somehow it stopped me in my tracks just to it's like well you know what is this you know but if you're there you have your bibles joshua chapter 2 20 there in verse 1 and there's about there's nine verses and some of these things i can't even pronounce and but we'll do our best amen so in chapter one there uh chapter 20 in verse one it says the lord also spake unto joshua saying uh speak to the children of israel saying a point out for you cities of refuge wherever i speak unto you by the hand of moses that the slayer that killeth any person unawares it says and unwittingly may flee thither says and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood and when he had and when he that does flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them and if the avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hands because he smoked his neighbor unwittingly and hated him not before time and he shall dwell in the city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the slayer return and come into his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled verse seven and they appointed kadish and galilee in mount uh nephilim like i said these some of these things i can't pronounce but then we have and it also talks about uh shicham and mount the euphratem and there is a uh kirchaf abra i mean arba which is hebron in the mountain of judah and on the other side of jordan by jericho eastward they assigned bizir in the wilderness upon the land plain uh of the tribe of robin and ramoth and gilead out of the tribe of god i mean gad and golan this is angolan and bastion out of the tribe of manassas he says these were the cities appointed for all the children of israel and for the strangers amen and i wanna i want you to catch this for a minute in verse nine and where it says there he says these were the cities appointed for all the children of israel and i want you to remember this part and for the strangers that sword journaleth it says among them that whosoever killeth any person that una wears might flee he says thinner and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stood before the congregation you may be seated and made a lord at his blessing on the rest of the reading of the word now i've read this before like i said there's just times i'll take a book read it and and if it you know then i'll just put it up but for some reason something struck me and we just kind of i've never preached it before this is you know i'm going to preach it to you amen and and i'm i'm depending on the holy spirit amen and that you know so you know looking at these things and so i even you know i'm i'm one of those two that if i find the scriptures i like to go see if brother branham's you know actually read it or if he even talked about it or maybe expound on it well i have found several different uh in the message you know in the where brother branham had talked about it he never really expounded he just talked about the same thing that you read that we had just read we get an understanding that these these cities were you know but first if you really look into uh history and because these were given to the levites they were actually given to the levites to take care of these cities they're the ones that were given the commission to actually put these cities together amen and you know because really during the time of the uh uh um in the wilderness when when there was uh there they were there at mount sinai man and there moses was up way up in the mountain and because you know they already told moses you go talk to god you know instead of god talking to us you go talk to god and when they whatever god tells you you you tell to us amen i mean they were already refusing grace because they wanted law amen so there we can see moses went up and he was there and and when he comes down he finds them what you know because it kind of took him a little while and and those people down it's like you know where's moses what's taking him so long amen so they figured well we'll just make us our own god amen and they made a calf amen glory and they worshipped that captain here's moses coming down amen with the word of god amen the ten commandments and there he's gonna present it to them and he finds them amen worshiping idols amen glory i mean that's how far they've really rejected god and look in in the levites the levites were not part of israel they weren't amen they were there amen but when moses said who will stand with me [Applause] amen glory to god the strangers to israel the ones they wouldn't even claim as neighbors or or whatever it was amen but they were there [Music] amen and there moses stood amen and saw what he said my then he says who will stand with me that will destroy amen the levites volunteered the levite side we'll stand with you amen and we'll go out and we'll destroy amen these idol worshipers amen and then when it come time now moses is off the face of the earth and now we have joshua and here it comes to joshua's an old man it's time for him to to divide the lands among the 12 tribes amen amen and there's nothing in the where where where uh where he begins to divide there's hands where going to the levites they were not part of the twelve tribes amen but then joshua says throw each each try amen was to give to the levites willingly from their hearts amen [Applause] they were to give to the levites amen and i believe they were given like 46 lands or whatever it is cities and all of that you know i'm not trying to go in very detailed in this because i don't want to take too much time and but there was also the six amen that were that was entrusted to them and they were to start this city and they were called the cities of refuge amen amen and then so that if something was to happen amen so here the next step was to what set up our six cities amen of refuge amen three on each side of the jordan river amen where where the a man slayer amen might might flee from the adventure of blood amen a man slave was someone who accidentally amen killed another person and the avenger of blood was usually a close relative amen and then to this to the slain person who who saw and he he sought to avenge the death amen and if a manslaughter could flee to a city of refuge amen he found a sanctuary amen there until the death of the high priest then he could walk return to his native city safely amen that's why i was and if we were to i don't know i'm sure it's being recorded if you give it a title we're going to title it christ amen the city of refuge christ the city of refuge amen glory to god hallelujah and you know the cities of refuge man are they are they're interesting amen and of the theological you know importance of it it was important amen because it had a it had a purpose and then it wasn't just something because they just was deciding to build cities it was important amen you know moses was commissioned to do this and then it fell on joshua amen and joshua commissioned it to the levites amen glory and so uh i wanted to go a little deeper and about you know these cities you know and and i was looking at a jewish commentary uh and how you know there's still some like maybe way back then that kept record of these things and i was just reading a little bit of these things and i'd like to share it with you amen if that's okay amen i hope it's sounding interesting already amen but we can see amen but we do have a christ amen we do have a god today we can run into amen he is our refuge amen hallelujah but they were they were here's these cities amen and and we also named them uh they they we read it in the scriptures amen and even the names uh i wanted to look at like what did they mean amen and uh so but here it was talking about this is number one it says the roads and remember now there's six and uh uh and there are three on each side of the uh the jordan the river and it was talking about it says the roads leading to the city of refuge were always kept through repair amen they're always repairing these roads amen now it's not because um i don't know how to really explain it but it was just because they had to make sure that whoever was fleeing and they that there would be nothing to hinder that person amen and they said the roads leading to the cities of refuge were always kept repaired it says and it says and required to be about 32 cubits that's 48 feet that's sometimes wider than some of the roads i drive on amen i mean they've got roads here where they set the speed limits at 70. that's that's very fast 70. amen but even the city even the city has to take care of the the road kills the debris amen use tires just falling everywhere and the cities are hired to make sure that you know nothing's gonna hinder your travel amen sometimes there's an accident that happens yeah there's an accident that happens amen and that's the same with the devil always wants to jump in the middle of the road and cause some kind of trouble to delay you amen but here they're saying that it had to be 48 feet that's how broad it was they were making sure amen number two it says the obstructions were removed that might stay the the flyers foot or or hinder his speed had to be clean all the time that way that whoever that who's running trying to get to whatever city he's trying to get to he's going to be he's going to make it amen glory and he said there was going to be no no was it was was left he says and no rivers no rivers was allowed over which there was not a bridge i mean they were making sure these roads just ah and i was thinking of that brother byler and i was like glory to god hallelujah and now it was just coming to me to i'm like oh my lord glory i said what you've done for me glory and how you clear that path just so i could make it amen at whatever speed i'm trying to get to him amen there was going to be nothing hindering amen i believe there comes a time in a person's heart amen that they begin to realize they're going to need a refuge amen and who do i go to who do i go to amen glory to god number four it says at every turning at every turning there were posts amen erected it says bearing the words refuge amen to guide amen the unhappy man in his flight oh glory to god hallelujah do you know how many ministers there is that's preaching this gospel amen look and if you're on the path trying to get to the refuge amen do you know how many ministers out there that god has that it don't matter if you're trying to make a left turn or a right turn there's a minister pointing to christ pointing to the refuge amen glory and god has purposely set amen these ministers or whoever he's using amen to point its dis way it's that way glory to god and there is only one way amen and i can't point to anybody different than what brother byler would point to or any other minister as long as they're on the word of god but there are men out there that might want to confuse you and tell you it's this way and it's not that way god has only one way of a provided way amen and it's through our lord jesus christ amen and we stand amen glory to god with the help of the holy spirit and we point to the refuge amen it's this way and there is no other way you might have to make a left turn you might have to make a right turn whatever it is but it has to lead to the same refuge amen glory they had signs those signs were put there and they made sure they weren't falling you know i've seen signs where last time there was a sign here now it's not there no more see it can't be that way the sign remains it's taken care of amen glory hallelujah and look maybe the wood they used rotted but it got maintained it got replaced amen glory number five it says when once settled in such a city the men's slayer had a convenient habitation assigned to him and he says and the citizens were to teach him amen some trades that he might support himself amen glory to god gloria look we don't make it in because we're hanging on to the pastor's coattail no you're going to be provided amen so you can glory to god learn yourself and and make it in amen hallelujah just because my mom comes here just because daddy comes here uncle aunt or whoever amen grandparents and you won't make it in because they're coming here amen but there is a provision amen glory to god to where you learn you grow up and you learn also amen so you'll know how to war and defend for yourself or provide for yourself amen glory i can't do all the praying for you i can't do all the repenting for you you got to do the same thing amen now these cities and then pictures the nation of israel and its guilt it says in connection with the slaying of the messiah amen and it says the cities of of um of refuge are a type of christ and their names are are significant amen in the connection he says the cities of refuge and the meanings of these uh uh the names are as followed as where he was talking about on on the west side of jordan which was katish which meant holiness amen meant strength hebron meant fellowship but it also means friendship amen and if you don't have friendship you don't have fellowship that's right and it means fellowship amen and also means friendship now on the east side of jordan it was raymond gilead which meant uplifting amen glory golan it meant happiness bizir meant safety amen and christ provides every blessing amen suggested by the names of these cities amen hallelujah the very refuge that i might point to amen this morning it has all of these in it amen glory how many would like to go to that city amen glory to god amen now a glance at the map you know if you sometimes your bible will have little maps and i actually looked it up and yes it was there and you know to show it to you you have to have a projector i don't i'm not all set up for that anyway that if you look it up that's it's even online you can look up certain things amen and but here i'm just trying to look at it trying to look at the types and i tell you what it was blessing me by the byler and i was like oh thank you lord glory to god i'm glad that the refuge was pointed amen that i saw a sign i saw a sign that was a man pointed them into the refuge glory to god god even gave us a prophet amen glory hallelujah hallelujah glory there you know the map it says it will show that the cities of refuge were strategically he says located so that no point in the land was more than 30 miles from one another amen and as the city of refuge were so situated as to be accessible it says accessible from every part of the land so christ is also accessible today no matter where you are on the face of the earth amen glory and i don't care what race you say you are or where you are to the earth god is accessible amen glory hallelujah praise god that they made sure these cities of refuge that no matter what part of the man they were they could like well i know there's one there and there's going to be a path that they could get onto and there's going to be signs pointing them to that refuge amen that path is going to be clear there's going to be no obstacles amen i like it when they're in joshua before they even pitch the 10th when god says i'll go before you and i've already searched out the land amen glory amen he knows he knows what you're tomorrow uh and he's already taken care of tomorrow it's gonna be a clear path amen oh don't don't don't don't get me wrong the devil's always trying to you know stick his foot out there to trip you amen but he can do that all he wants amen just because he tripped you that don't mean that sign disappears you just get up you just get up and keep running amen you have one goal amen and that's to get to the refuge amen hallelujah and no matter what he does amen glory amen he likes to break marriages amen he likes to do this or do that he likes to stir and cause contentions amen that you just get up amen glory and keep running to the refuge amen [Music] look and we won't have an excuse to say well brother i didn't see the sign i didn't know where to turn amen god will make sure amen glory praise god hallelujah and here he is he's accessible we can we can we can get to him anytime you want to i believe you can get to christ oh praise the lord amen look they're in first dawn in chapter two amen reading one and two and let's just look at this for a minute because here it says in in in chapter two of of first john in verse one it says my little children amen does that make you feel special my little children and then there's he's not just standing there like as god he's standing there as as a father a father amen my little children he says these things right unto you amen i he says right i unto sin not amen but the verse didn't stop there amen it doesn't stop there it's not like the verse is supposed to like here he's being a father he's calling us children and he said i don't want you to sin amen well don't stand there just like oh my what am i gonna do you know here's that thought amen i'm only human lord now look we're more than that amen yes i'm in this flesh and i'm going to continue making mistakes amen glory to god but let's just look at it he said my little children these things right i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin look at this first he's telling us he doesn't want us to sin why is that that's because god is perfect that's right and you know that's what he'd like to bring us to amen remember we're becoming him amen and i like the part in the scripture where it says when he finally comes amen there on the cloud and when we see him we'll know him we'll know him because what because we'll be like him glory and god is going to make a way amen and if you're part of it there's not going to be one hindrance amen in your path to get to that place man of perfection so he says these things right i unto you that ye sin not and he says and if any man sin we have an advocate with he says what with god now that's not wrong either but that's not the word used in that verse he said father amen see he he's pointing to the very attribute yeah he's god and the only reason he's god is because he could be worshipped but god had attributes amen he longed to have you as his children part of his family and here it points out it's saying advocate he says with the father he says jesus christ the righteous amen glory and verse two and he says and he is the prophetiation of our sins and not it says and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world so you mean the world the whole entire world has access oh my yes they do god has made sure amen he's not just wanting to be god to the whole world but he is wanting to show them that fathership amen even to the whole entire world and by every day he's rejected every day amen they come up with a another kind of idea that it's this way or it's that way the homosexual says we have a way this group here says we have a way amen you got the atheists and the agnostics amen now the atheists just don't believe period don't believe in a god you know what eggnox is they're the ones that's halfway halfway kind of like maybe there is a god but an atheist just flat out will tell you no there's no god amen but eggnog they say man and that you know a an agnostic we'll take a plant eggplant i mean just totally dried up brother and they'll water it and say it might live amen now an atheist won't give it a time they won't give the time of the day to even water they just said it's dead amen but look we don't serve god because we believe there's a chance amen it doesn't work that way look you either believe or you don't amen you don't ask god for healing because you feel like well there's a chance he might heal me that's the wrong way to approach god amen it's already a finish work he's already healed us amen it's not by a chance that i'm going to tell myself it might work it might work brother byler if i pray oh my i'll pray for my brother i'll pray for my sister because maybe there's a chance amen glory no that's not how we serve him amen glory that's the way the world is amen but i believe they're still people i believe amen the gospel is still to be preached i believe there's still souls that needs to be won amen glory amen i believe every human being on the face of the world brother byler has a chance today amen amen but one day yeah they will be gone amen one day but right now amen glory sometimes our attitude toward amen toward the way the world is you know sometimes that makes us look kind of bad sometimes we just got to go to god and say lord i know i know you can do it amen our president biden is clear out of his mind but you have to say lord i know you can heal that man you can heal not only physically but also spiritually that man needs the holy ghost hey man you know but look the whole earth needs the holy ghost and there's still an opportunity amen i believe the path is still being cleared and then i believe the path is still being maintained amen glory i believe the signs are still being placed right there amen and there are those that god are using and saying this is the way amen glory he said i am the way the truth and the life amen glory that's who we point to now john gives us god's uh he says this is god's perfect standard here we just read the scriptures says my little children these things write eye unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous amen and he is the propitiation for for our sins amen and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world amen glory to god and john is trying to say and he's trying to give us here what he's trying to give god's perfect standard amen for his people and his his gracious provision amen in the the the the event of failure because we do sometimes fail and he wants you to know hey we have an advocate little children refers to all the members of the families of god amen glory when he's saying my my little children i can put my name right there glory to god amen god's perfect standard is then set forth amen in the words these things i write to you that ye may not sin that is his standards because god is perfect and we see because god is perfect so his standards for his people is absolute perfection he would not be god if he said these things i write to you so that you send just as little as you can no god doesn't want you to sin amen the lord jesus did this with a woman amen who had been caught uh in the act of adultery he said neither do i condemn you go and sin no more because that's what he wanted to see or do that was his standards god's not going to teach any other way glory hallelujah but at the same time the lord knows our what our frame amen he remembers that we are all dust amen and so he has what graciously made provision for us in the event he says of failure and all of these things and this is the expression and the word says if anyone sins then we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous an advocate is what is one who comes amen to the side of another person in time of need in order to help amen glory this is exactly what the lord jesus does for us amen when we actually sin amen now he's not patting you on the back and said it's all right god don't even sweep sin under the rug god's gonna deal with it he's our father going to spank us amen if there's going to be anybody not spoiling the rod that's going to be our father he immediately comes to us in order to restore us amen to the fellowship with himself look god don't want to lose fellowship with you any more i mean you know and what you would want he wants to keep in contact he wants that amen but here notice that it does not say if any men confess his sins amen now as our advocate the lord seeks to bring us to that place where we do confess and what and forsake our sins but there is something very wonderful in this verse which we should not overlook it says and if anyone sins we have an advocate with the father he doesn't become an advocate because i confess my sins amen he is there as soon as it happens he's there as our advocate but there's something about the spirit amen that'll struck your heart that you will run to god and say i'm sorry you will confess and say lord i'm sorry amen glory to god amen and here we even like i was telling you it doesn't even say with god but rather it says with the father amen he is still our father amen even if we sin see this reminds us amen of the blessed truth amen that through sin in a believer's life amen it might break the fellowship but it does not break the relationship amen look when a person is born again he cannot amen i mean he becomes a child of god so god is henceforth his father and nothing can ever amen affect that relationship a birth a birth is something that cannot be undone amen i can undo my natural birth amen i can't tell my mom and dad and say hey i i i just changed my mind i don't want to be your son i don't want you to be my mom you can't be my dad amen you can't change that amen now you might do things to break the fellowship you have even with your natural parents that you will not break the relationship you can amen until we are born again how many years born again amen glory to god but as being born again do you still make mistakes i do and those mistakes amen sometimes will separate the fellowship i have with the father but it does not separate me from the relationship he remains a father i remain a son amen but until i can actually amen glory where i can approach him and maybe confess and say i'm sorry then i can gain that fellowship again amen glory look one of those cities is meant fellowship amen so if i want to gain fellowship i need to run back to him and say papa god i know i've broken this fellowship between you and i amen glory i want it back amen glory then let me tell you something he wants it back just as much as you do he couldn't handle it when adam and eve there and then broke their fellowship amen with the father amen glory to god and there was god telling them i'm gonna make a way i'm going to make a way amen there's going to be a city of refuge amen glory hallelujah we'll gain this fellowship again hallelujah you know as soon as soon but he is still a son by the fact of his birth amen but notice that our advocate is jesus jesus christ the righteous amen it is good to have a righteous defender amen look when satan brings some accusation amen against a believer you and i amen the lord can point amen to his finished work on calvary and say charge that to my account glory to god and the lord our advocate but what is also the appropriation well now i can't say these words for our sins amen this means that by dying for us and then he freed us amen from the guilt of our sins and restored us to god by what providing the needed satisfaction amen and by removing every barrier and then to fellowship amen glory to god he made sure that when you're running to that city of fellowship amen that the path there it was all cleared up for you you can run back amen hallelujah glory god can show mercy to us because christ has satisfied the claim of justice amen glory hallelujah there he hung on the cross he was becoming what sin oh he didn't like it because he was separating from his father if god if jesus felt that way how much more we should feel amen when we do sin and when we make mistakes amen glory to god we want to walk find the path back to the refuge amen glory and on your way back there yes the devil's going to try to hinder you amen glory but however you fall on your way there get up and keep going amen keep pressing on going to go don't give up hallelujah amen it is not often that an advocate or lawyer pays for the client's sin amen i've never had a lawyer pay for my mistakes amen yet that is what our lord has done amen and most remarkable of all he paid what for them by the sacrifice of himself john adds that he is what the satisfying sacrifice amen not for our sins only but also for the whole world amen imagine god way up there saw calvary and when that blood was shed god said i'm satisfied and it wasn't just for a special group of people he said i'm satisfied i'm satisfied that it covered the whole world's sins amen glory to god oh hallelujah that's why brothers and sisters we've got to stay busy if it's a loved one if it's a family i don't care neighbor maybe you know they're not serving god but you can point to the path and you can give them the sign and say it's this way amen glory to god because they still have a chance don't give up on anybody amen glory to god hallelujah i don't know have i kept you too long brother or hey man maybe just five ten more minutes i don't know i think you guys only have a morning service everybody in a hurry to get to the mexican restaurant i don't know amen glory praise god well i tell you just like the disciples said you know to whom shall we go oh my he said you're the only one we know that's got the eternal life he says you're the only one this is the only path we know to run to it's to you glory amen and i believe that christ was preparing the way just like john the baptist was preparing the way amen glory i believe christ had prepared the way amen had cleared it all up for you to run to him amen where are you going for eternity amen glory hallelujah now here now we know just because he was satisfied this does not mean that the whole world is actually saved that's a sad part we do know that amen but i believe we seek our own salvation with fear and trembling amen but i believe that we should always have the attitude to be ready to point and say this is the way. amen but we do know him being satisfied it rather it means that the work of the lord is sufficient in value to save all the world but it is only efficient to save those who actually put their trust in him amen it is because his work is sufficient for all men that the gospel amen can be offered to the whole entire world but if all men were automatically saved there would be need for the preaching i don't need to do this anymore that it needs saved amen so the gospel has to be preached amen it is interesting that you know that the superscription and of the uh on the cross was written in in so many different languages and why was god allowing that hey that way no one would have an excuse what was god doing hey that everybody saw a sign that this is the way glory to god amen greek or whatever latin and all of those hebrew amen it was all written it was to proclaim that to all the world that jesus christ is what the sufficient savior for all men everywhere amen they had a way to christ amen christ was accessible hallelujah glory to god now notice the parallels between the the temporal salvation offered the manslaughter here he says in the cities of the refuge and the eternal salvation offered to sinners and christ he says the road to the city were clear and well marked just like the way of salvation amen so that none would make a mistake or lose his life amen christ drove people amen to the city of refuge and many times a crisis is needed to drive people to the lord jesus for refuge amen and you think this colvin thing was just some accident thing i believe god was trying to purposely drive people amen to himself glory to god letting the people know hey i'm a refuge you can come to me amen and i believe i mean i've heard testimonies through the battle of kova amen glory there's people there's wives that had testified that said my my my husband wouldn't even go to church to me amen but because of colvin they had the live stream and the husband had the live stream with her and she and he heard the word he saw a sign this is the way oh he gave his life to the lord and he wanted to be baptized amen glory god knows what he's doing sometimes he does have to send some kind of crisis say man glory amen there was no neutral ground amen for the guilty person amen he was either safe in the city or subject to the wrath of the blood of that avenger amen each individual is either safe in christ or under the judgment of god amen there's a scripture in john 3 36 it reads like this he says he that believeth on the son had everlasting life it seems so simple don't amen but this part here where it says he that believeth that has to be genuine it has to be real amen and i believe if a man or a woman does that god sees the heart god knows that person he promised he would give them everlasting life amen now and when i read scriptures like this i'm not talking about bride amen you don't have to be bride to make it in amen bride will go into the city amen that there's going to be those outside the city but i don't care lord if that my neighbor is supposed to be only outside the city somehow rip their hearts amen and get in there amen and if you're the neighbor then you ought to act right talk right amen and dress right or whatever amen whatever god has placed you there for a purpose to be a sign and say this is the way. we've got to have the right attitudes amen for our neighbor amen i believe if you believe you're saved how many here believe you saved amen the bible teaches us to what walk the talk amen don't do all just don't be talking talking amen but actually walk your talk whatever talk you're claiming walk it amen because people are watching amen glory to god praise god so there he says he that believeth on the sun says hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him it just seems like pretty flat pretty simple and it's the truth amen but god has given christ the power amen to grant everlasting life to all who believe on him amen this is one amen of the clearest verses amen and all the bible on how the person can be saved amen it is simply by believing in our lord jesus christ and as we read this verse say man we should realize that god is speaking and he is making a promise that can never be broken you understand that right amen god can say ah i didn't really mean that i changed my mind um if he said it he's got a abide by see god when he talks he does walk it amen glory to god to accept his promise is not a leap in the dark amen it is simply believing what could not possibly be false amen glory and those who do not obey the son of god shall not see life but the wrath of god abides on them already my my from this verse we learn that our eternal destiny depends on what what we do with the son of god we've got the signs what do you do when you see the signs and you ignore you are going to be lost you're going to be lost just like the world amen hallelujah he is making a promise amen and that promise is ours hallelujah now if we receive him i believe god gives us eternal life as a free gift remember that brothers and sisters a free gift i'll tell you what was on my mind what i wanted to preach it was going to be titled being identified by the gifts of god but i he he wanted me to preach this amen but it is a free gift amen if we reject him we will never enjoy everlasting life amen and not only so but god's wrath already hangs over fall at any moment notice that there is nothing in this verse about keeping the law obeying the golden rule or going to church amen what did he say there in the book of john in chapter 8 there in verse 24 he said i say therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins amen here he solemnly warned them again they would die in their sins amen glory if they steadfastly refuse to believe on him there was no alternative amen glory apart from the lord jesus there is no way to obtain forgiveness of sins amen and those who die with sins unforgiven amen cannot possibly enter into heaven at last the word the word he is not found amen in this bird you know the he the word he in the original scripture if you have a really old bible i have one of those that actually folds three ways it's a really old bible my brother-in-law gave it to me and there's times i try to compare it you know there are some things in there you won't find but in that original bible you will not find the word he where he says i say therefore unto you where it says if ye believe not that i am he that he is not there it just says if you don't believe i am amen just like he told moses i am that i am amen it was pretty straight he said i am he said and you'll die in your sins glory but look [Music] but somehow even in there he says you know we can even see even if you go to the original word where that he is not there we see in the words where he says i am it's another claim to what deity by the lord jesus oh wow glory to god let me close at this amen i just want to read something to you it's a quote it's titled uh letting off the pressure and it wouldn't be how many years just gone through so much but now you can come to the refuge amen he's here where you can just you know let off the pressure you're safe now god has provided everything you need of amen you can relax amen that's one of the things there when david stepped into the chapter 23 amen where it says that they're in the midst of his enemies god has laid a table what's that what picture does that give you that means it doesn't matter how david is fighting his enemies what war he's going through god had placed a table where god said sit down david relax amen glory and watch me fight the battles for you amen glory i mean who places a table in the middle of the war amen come on when you're about to fight a an army you know and well if you were about to fight a war do you think of a pizza and pork chops and or whatever now you're thinking about oh my is that the day i'm gonna die or or have i trained enough am i going to make it you'll be so nervous amen he won't think about that stuff but god was purposely telling david relax sit down pull up a chair i'll take care of everything and i believe everything that david needed was on that table amen glory and i believe he's a refuge here tonight i mean here this morning amen and he's got everything you need happiness you need to be uplifted amen i believe he's got it amen you need fellowship he'll he can restore that amen glory but that very city i was talking about it said it meant holiness amen that's because he's gone look one of those cities had to be where it meant holiness god is that our city you know here our lord jesus christ that city of refuge amen though we can get holiness there i mean we can get happiness there we can be uplifted fellowship we can get strength we can be we can feel safe amen but god still will appoint you the holiness that's because he is holy it's his standards amen glory he don't just do away with those things amen now here branham talks about letting off the pressure he says now what a place to come yes outside he says outside you die but inside you're safe amen let me tell you something if that man even though it was an accident and he killed somebody somebody was going to avenge that blood and go after that amen and if they never make it amen or neglected to run to one of those cities of refuge he was going to die amen they were they hang on to a law that says a tooth for a tooth in the eye for an eye and yeah but here brother man says what a place to come amen yes he said outside you die

way pointing to a sign that this is the way he said he is the life the way the truth and the life glory that is the only way lord he right there lord was becoming that city of refuge lord there he was

unspoken lord of god you knew it lord glory to god lord i believe lord we have found the refuge that's you lord glory lord one of the things lord i didn't mention lord of god but maybe just through this prayer just something to think about but there our christ even though the the the pharisees lord the leaders lord they didn't see him fit to be a priest he didn't even have the credentials or any kind of schooling law or to be a priest lord but we know the bible says in the order of melchizedek glory to god that there our lord jesus christ played the role of the high priest lord and there it talks about that the man slayer that before he could even leave the city amen glory that the high priest had to be dead and i believe you hung on the cross there as playing the role of the high priest lord that there the man slayer could go home free glory go back to his homeland lord i believe we're going back to our homeland and there for eternity all glory to god the liberty we're going to have lord maybe the freedom here is just temporal lord the the the world is lord it's like the government's trying to take a freedom away one day it is going to be gone lord of god but there's one freedom we will not lose lord o god because we can look back because that one lord that played the high priest there hung on the cross and died for us hallelujah glory our free we have the liberty lord we can go back to our homeland lord and walk freely no fear lord of god there's not going to be any demon there's no devil trying to attack us thank you jesus thank you lord of god hallelujah glory lord we may seek you now for a refuge lord of god oh what that day will be when we finally cross over all for eternity lord of god lord i'm longing for that day lord lord and i'm not saying lord of god that i don't want to be in this world no more lord but the way in the condition that it is i don't lord i want to leave but lord this one day will be ours again but it'll be pure glory to god hallelujah it'll be worth stepping on again lord once you cleanse it up thank you jesus hallelujah lord you are so gracious and so mindful lord you're so wonderful glory to god lord there's just times lord we

give each other gifts lord we thank you for the gifts lord you've given but lord with those gifts lord of god we want to apply it to our lives and lord we want to be identified by them lord there you were just laying in a manger and those migies came lord of god from from afar off lord and gave you gifts and those gifts you were identified the goal that they gave you as gift you you were identified by that by the deity lord the frankincense lord of god that was given to you lord you identified yourself as the sacrifice of ser this lord of god and the murder that was given to you you identified yourself through death lord of god but you had performed lord and it was identified your works was identified lord by those gifts and lord as you had placed these gifts lord to us and given
