[7:29] that's that God is Jesus Christ the son
[7:31] of the Living God praise the Lord so
[7:33] we're glad to be in the house of God

[49:19] the spirit has to say to the church this
[49:21] morning amen amen praise the Lord here's

[49:30] Lord I Lift It

[49:37] BL come and
[49:40] [Music]
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:11] [Music]
[50:15] praise the
[50:17] Lord God bless you friends very good to
[50:20] see you uh very good to be here finally
[50:22] um as brother berer was mentioning uh we
[50:25] tried to get here a few months ago um my
[50:31] uh my grandmother had some heart issues
[50:33] is what happened um and that's an
[50:36] interesting situation Lord's been
[50:38] dealing with me since I've been about 15
[50:41] years old and when he started moving on
[50:43] my life uh you
[50:46] know sometimes families kind
[50:49] of distance themselves right so that's
[50:52] kind of what happened uh my grandma and
[50:55] me and um started kind of distancing and
[50:59] so anyway I get this phone call that
[51:02] she's got this heart condition and her
[51:04] heart is uh 25% or less um you know very
[51:09] very serious condition uh so bad that
[51:12] they can't do surgery on her there's too
[51:14] much risk so basically she was in the
[51:17] condition where either she's going to
[51:19] improve or not so we had the opportunity
[51:22] to go speak to her pray with her she was
[51:24] in the hospital at that time and
[51:27] um what ended up happening is her heart
[51:29] started to get better and better and uh
[51:32] and so she was able to receive uh a
[51:35] defibrillator um and she was able to
[51:37] have surgery and things like that um but
[51:40] what's most important and most
[51:42] interesting about that
[51:45] situation is at the end of it she asked
[51:47] me hey can I have one of those Church
[51:49] age books you read and so today we know
[51:53] God can deal with heart conditions
[51:55] physically and he can deal with heart
[51:57] conditions
[51:58] spiritually we've got a lot to be
[52:00] thankful for we had a nice Thanksgiving
[52:03] I I pray everybody had a great
[52:05] Thanksgiving um my wife would have
[52:08] really loved to be here I've got four
[52:10] kids um and we found out that she is
[52:14] expecting another one so she wasn't
[52:17] feeling the
[52:18] best thank
[52:20] you so she wasn't feeling quite up to up
[52:25] to traveling five and a half hours with
[52:27] four kids and being pregnant so um she
[52:29] sends her greetings and us you know she
[52:32] is praying for you all and um and so we
[52:36] just want to go to the Lord in prayer
[52:38] before we open the word we want to go to
[52:40] the
[52:42] author dear Lord gracious Lord we thank
[52:46] you for your mercies on our lives we
[52:48] thank you for just the great testimonies
[52:52] Lord sometimes we look at situations and
[52:55] they seem gleam
[52:58] dull and and we don't know what to make
[52:59] of them but Lord you can take conditions
[53:02] and turn them around Lord in ways we
[53:05] couldn't have even imagined you can you
[53:07] can turn lives around you can heal
[53:10] conditions that are heredity you can
[53:12] heal spiritual conditions Lord
[53:15] Jesus and Lord
[53:18] God I stand here today just a
[53:22] man and and we're here listening to a
[53:25] voice today but God really all that
[53:28] matters is that we hear from you and we
[53:31] get the opportunity to touch you Lord
[53:34] that's all that
[53:35] matters pray Lord God that you use a
[53:38] vessel Lord and and that you just help
[53:41] your body surely there's many needs
[53:43] amongst your children Lord and we just
[53:46] pray Lord God that that their prayers
[53:50] Lord be sent up Lord you just walk in
[53:53] their
[53:53] midst we thank you Lord Jesus for your
[53:56] grace and your mercy thank you for a
[53:59] message Lord that that told us exactly
[54:02] the conditions that we're in Jesus we
[54:06] praise you we thank you and we ask these
[54:08] things in Jesus name
[54:11] amen
[54:13] amen we're going to open up to
[54:18] Revelation
[54:21] 1 verse 17
[54:27] and we're going to read 17 and
[54:42] 18 and when I saw him I fell at his feet
[54:45] as dead and he laid his right hand upon
[54:48] me saying unto me fear not I am the
[54:52] first and the last I am he that liveth
[54:56] dead and behold I'm alive Evermore amen
[55:01] and have the keys of hell and
[55:04] death we thank you
[55:07] Lord thank you Lord for the reading of
[55:09] your word we just ask that you bless it
[55:11] Lord if I could take a title tonight
[55:14] it's going to be fear not I want to look
[55:17] at where Jesus said fear
[55:20] not he has the keys of death and hell
[55:24] you may have your seats
[55:28] so Jesus speaking here we know the first
[55:31] chapter is a revelation of who he is
[55:35] when he's speaking to John at
[55:37] Patmos he's showing him who it has been
[55:40] all along amen who has been called
[55:43] Jehovah the almighty God the Everlasting
[55:46] father amen the first and the last the
[55:49] Alpha and the Omega it's Jesus Christ
[55:54] amen and he was saying I have the keys
[55:57] of hell and
[55:59] death and brother brandham said in the
[56:02] key to the door he said any key cannot
[56:05] unlock no door until it's used by a hand
[56:09] it's got to have something to use the
[56:11] key the key in and of itself not use
[56:15] itself it's got to have something to
[56:19] yield brother Brenham said and we can
[56:21] see Jesus
[56:23] 58 so that's the way Divine Healing
[56:26] is it not upon some emotion not upon
[56:31] shaking or something of that type not
[56:33] upon anything but accepting what God
[56:36] promised you and Jesus died that you may
[56:39] have
[56:40] it no one can properly and clearly
[56:43] preach the gospel without preaching
[56:45] Divine Healing you just can't do it for
[56:48] sickness is an attribute of sin and you
[56:52] can't deal with sickness without dealing
[56:53] with sin because sickness came as an
[56:56] attribute of
[56:58] sin before we had any sickness we had no
[57:01] sin but when we got sin sickness
[57:04] followed
[57:05] it you have to deal with both together
[57:08] may I say it like this he said if a big
[57:11] animal had a paw by digging at my side
[57:14] and he was tearing out my ribs the rest
[57:17] of the animal wasn't bothering me but it
[57:19] was just as paw and he said it was
[57:21] tearing his ribs out he said now I don't
[57:23] have to find a knife to cut off his paw
[57:25] just knock him on the head and in my
[57:28] field of profession that's what we call
[57:29] Root calls analysis you go to the root
[57:32] calls you cut off you take his head off
[57:34] that kills the whole animal well that's
[57:37] the way it is with sin when you kill sin
[57:39] you kill every attribute that follows it
[57:42] so it may not be that you've but the
[57:45] weakness of your parents and your
[57:46] parents' parents sickness is heredity in
[57:48] many cases he said and each generation
[57:51] gets weaker and wiser as the scripture
[57:53] says and so therefore you have have to
[57:56] deal with sickness and sin on the same
[57:58] basis of the
[58:00] atonement and in studying The Book of
[58:02] Revelations and seeing the enemy exposed
[58:04] by the power of God we need to
[58:06] understand something Satan has still
[58:08] been
[58:09] successful he's been successful at
[58:11] deceiving and and corrupting the world
[58:14] he's been successful at destroying lives
[58:16] and hiding his true identity within the
[58:18] church amen in the nominal Church World
[58:22] they'll point out that the Roman
[58:23] Catholic Church is the great harlot now
[58:26] think about that how well has Satan
[58:29] really hid himself if the ones pointing
[58:31] out that Satan is in the Catholic church
[58:34] are they themselves called the daughters
[58:36] of the Harlot amen and the Bible said
[58:39] those daughters have blous
[58:41] names so they notice that Satan sits in
[58:44] this great church but they can't notice
[58:46] the deception in their own lives and in
[58:49] their own church but to the believer
[58:52] what we see in the Book of Revelation is
[58:54] more than just an exposure of Satan's
[58:57] deception the beginning of the book
[58:59] shows that is lost
[59:02] amen and that's what we want to focus on
[59:05] Amen and brother Brenham in the fourth
[59:08] seal he's talking about the pale horse
[59:10] rider whose name was called Death he
[59:13] didn't have a name up to that time but
[59:17] when he became the Pale Horse the rider
[59:19] that sat on him was called Death now
[59:22] he's got a name Amen brother brandham in
[59:24] the for se he talked about
[59:26] he talked about how 68 million were put
[59:29] to death for protesting that first Roman
[59:31] Church 68 million died protesting that
[59:35] Roman church now he said no wonder he
[59:37] could imp himself in the name called
[59:40] Death he sure was God only knows how
[59:43] many he calls to spiritually die by his
[59:46] anti-bible word teaching this is the one
[59:50] he put 68 million to the sword and
[59:52] killed and probably literally billions
[59:55] died he said literally billions died on
[59:57] his false teaching no wonder he could
[1:00:00] take the name of death see the writer in
[1:00:02] the first place was the
[1:00:05] anti-christ he was death to begin with
[1:00:07] then he received a crown he said a
[1:00:09] Triple
[1:00:11] Crown one and when he did then he United
[1:00:14] his church and state because he was over
[1:00:17] both of them then see if he can unite
[1:00:20] his State and his church together then
[1:00:22] the red horse could ride sure enough and
[1:00:25] that red horse was the second movement
[1:00:28] after the White Horse and I'm just
[1:00:30] laying a foundation and the Bible says
[1:00:33] that after the White Horse the man that
[1:00:35] sat on him was given a crown then we
[1:00:38] find that the red horse began to ride
[1:00:41] and it said he was given a sword and the
[1:00:43] reason he was given a sword was because
[1:00:45] he had more power now behind him and
[1:00:48] that was the power of the church and the
[1:00:50] authority of the state that he had
[1:00:52] together amen so he United both forces
[1:00:55] of phys
[1:00:56] and spiritual and then brother brenon
[1:00:58] went on to say again in the for seal he
[1:01:00] said now he rides in a trinity this
[1:01:03] horse rides in a trinity a power of a
[1:01:05] trinity a trinity he's a trinity even
[1:01:08] though there's four horses there that
[1:01:11] fourth horse actually all three of them
[1:01:13] wrapped up into one because these colors
[1:01:15] are all it's pale in color he said and
[1:01:18] they're all wrapped up into one red
[1:01:21] white and black right and brother
[1:01:23] Brenham said just as three things make a
[1:01:26] Christian a Son of God there's three
[1:01:29] powers that make a devil who he is the
[1:01:32] three things that make you a Son of God
[1:01:34] is water blood and spirit you can't be a
[1:01:37] Son of God with just the water and the
[1:01:39] blood because if you have just the water
[1:01:41] and the blood but no Spirit there's no
[1:01:44] life and many of us can accept the
[1:01:46] washing of the water amen but you've got
[1:01:48] to go further than that you got to put
[1:01:51] it under the blood once you put it under
[1:01:53] the blood don't go back and visit it
[1:01:55] again
[1:01:57] and normally I I wouldn't talk about
[1:02:00] this type of thing uh openly like like
[1:02:03] this but as I was studying this topic um
[1:02:06] the Lord dealt with me in in a dream and
[1:02:08] I hope this is okay to share I was
[1:02:11] laying to sleep one night and had this
[1:02:13] dream that this woman came up and laid
[1:02:16] next to me and she asked me she said
[1:02:19] tell me about your past and I said no
[1:02:22] but I can tell you about how the blood
[1:02:23] of Jesus me and she said said no no no
[1:02:27] tell me about your path and I said no
[1:02:29] but I can tell you about how the blood
[1:02:30] of Jesus covers me she said tell tell me
[1:02:33] about your your weaknesses I said no but
[1:02:35] I can tell you about how the blood of
[1:02:36] Jesus covers me and her Fang started to
[1:02:39] show and her teeth started to grow and
[1:02:40] she started clawing at me and hitting me
[1:02:42] and she said tell me about your
[1:02:44] sicknesses and I said no but I can tell
[1:02:46] you about how the blood of Jesus covers
[1:02:48] me her nails grew and she started
[1:02:51] digging and choking and I said no but I
[1:02:53] can tell you about how the blood of
[1:02:55] Jesus covers me and I woke up and there
[1:02:58] was a ball of light
[1:03:00] hanging and I Heard a Voice say fear not
[1:03:04] and as I went back to sleep I began to
[1:03:06] realize right before I fell asleep all
[1:03:09] of what that demon was doing wasn't
[1:03:12] harming me it was bluffing me it wasn't
[1:03:16] cutting me really it wasn't choking me I
[1:03:18] was still breathing it was pounding on
[1:03:20] me but I didn't feel it there was no
[1:03:22] harm the devil was a bluff
[1:03:25] the devil's defeated
[1:03:28] today and so we want to delve into that
[1:03:31] there's three powers that make the devil
[1:03:33] and the powers are politics religion and
[1:03:36] demonic power amen and Satan unites his
[1:03:39] forces to better subdue people and and
[1:03:42] and to keep them imprisoned amen he
[1:03:45] leverages things in our life through
[1:03:47] insecurities and sicknesses inherited
[1:03:51] from from foods and environmental and
[1:03:53] andary sicknesses
[1:03:56] and this carries a dual power physical
[1:03:59] in nature and spiritual in nature it has
[1:04:02] a physical impact and a spiritual impact
[1:04:05] I just came forward today and told you a
[1:04:07] testimony of a physical he healing and a
[1:04:10] spiritual healing amen when things run
[1:04:13] in families fear takes root because of
[1:04:16] who's succumbed before each person who's
[1:04:19] who's who's fell to that sickness each
[1:04:23] death is reinforcing the disease disas
[1:04:25] his grip on a previous generation it's
[1:04:28] more than just a physical battle amen
[1:04:31] and and maybe some of you are currently
[1:04:33] struggling with an Affliction where
[1:04:35] Satan has put together multiple pieces
[1:04:37] to maintain his hold through Power and
[1:04:39] through fear and this fear fear can
[1:04:42] paralyze fear can paralyze your faith
[1:04:46] amen but Jesus spoke fear not fear
[1:04:50] paralyzes a person's faith and takes
[1:04:52] away their spiritual stamina and
[1:04:54] sometimes it it could make you almost
[1:04:56] ready to give
[1:04:58] up however you should know that Satan is
[1:05:01] not the one you
[1:05:02] fear and brother Brenham said and be not
[1:05:06] afraid there's two elements that control
[1:05:09] the entire race in the world one of them
[1:05:11] is fear and the other is
[1:05:14] Faith now it's either fear or faith
[1:05:16] controls every nation every denomination
[1:05:19] every
[1:05:20] individual you're either fear or faith
[1:05:23] that controls you amen amen and God
[1:05:26] testifying of his gifts so don't fear
[1:05:30] fear is of the devil Everything Jesus
[1:05:32] would say fear not fear not constantly
[1:05:35] fear not fear not is that right always
[1:05:38] fear not God don't want you to fear he
[1:05:42] wants you to believe so every one of you
[1:05:45] believe with one Accord one Accord every
[1:05:50] one the Bible says in 1 John 4 17 to9
[1:06:00] herein is our love made
[1:06:02] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[1:06:04] day of judgment because as he is so are
[1:06:08] we in this world there is no fear and
[1:06:11] love but perfect love casteth out
[1:06:14] fear because fear hath
[1:06:17] torment that fearth is not made perfect
[1:06:20] in love we love him because he first
[1:06:23] loved us when you encounter fear in your
[1:06:26] life understand this truth it's not from
[1:06:29] God he never put fear upon you and this
[1:06:33] means you every right to dismiss the
[1:06:36] devil
[1:06:37] completely acknowledge it give it space
[1:06:40] or spend even a moment considering it
[1:06:43] you can rightfully fear that surfaces in
[1:06:46] your life you never asked for it God
[1:06:48] never sent it and it has no place in a
[1:06:51] believer's
[1:06:52] life amen
[1:06:56] fear was never part of God's divine plan
[1:06:59] fear comes from the enemy and it's the
[1:07:01] church job to eliminate the enemy and
[1:07:04] his devices not to accommodate them amen
[1:07:08] look at scripture fear was absent until
[1:07:11] sin came in in Genesis there was perfect
[1:07:15] harmony no fear between Adam and the
[1:07:17] animals no fear of God no fear at all
[1:07:20] until the fall it was only when Adam and
[1:07:23] Eve sinned that fear emerged Ed when God
[1:07:26] found Adam hiding behind the Fig leaes
[1:07:29] Adam confessed that he was
[1:07:31] afraid this was fears first appearance
[1:07:34] and it was born from
[1:07:36] snation and that's why Paul would tell
[1:07:39] the church in Romans 8 that for those
[1:07:42] who are in Christ who walk after and not
[1:07:45] the flesh condemnation is gone amen so
[1:07:50] what he's presenting is life without
[1:07:52] fear replaced by faith
[1:07:55] a life where belief simply rules in your
[1:07:58] heart now think about this only a
[1:08:01] demonic
[1:08:02] Force trying to steal your true
[1:08:05] Christian experience which is rest amen
[1:08:09] but we're resting today in knowing God
[1:08:11] is God and we're his children and
[1:08:14] everything he's promised he's either
[1:08:16] doing or has done so what's Left to Fear
[1:08:20] our theme song is only believe amen yes
[1:08:25] amen
[1:08:26] amen amen Satan is not the one who we
[1:08:30] should stand in fear of today but we
[1:08:32] should stand in fear of a holy
[1:08:35] God and this fear is reverence of his
[1:08:39] words this fear is respect this this
[1:08:42] fear is love for when his Spirit begins
[1:08:45] to move you ought to not just look at it
[1:08:47] and say well that's just for them no you
[1:08:51] ought to say God if I'm missing
[1:08:53] something give it to me because I I fear
[1:08:56] your presence
[1:08:57] amen and Satan's first deception as we
[1:09:01] just talked about was through a serpent
[1:09:04] the Beauty and the smartness of the
[1:09:07] serpent coupled with Satan's craftiness
[1:09:09] was a combination Eve couldn't resist he
[1:09:13] used what you could see and he used what
[1:09:15] you could hear and he took the word of
[1:09:17] God and presented it to her but he
[1:09:20] coupled it with beauty and
[1:09:21] craftiness and she couldn't overcome it
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:26] so Satan's very power uses lies and
[1:09:28] symptoms and family history and if you
[1:09:31] would look down history of the
[1:09:32] scriptures you would see how much Satan
[1:09:34] uses these types of alliances to come
[1:09:37] against God's people and Satan of death
[1:09:41] over man and the questions of immorality
[1:09:43] and what happens beyond the grave man
[1:09:46] could not see past that veil of
[1:09:50] Darkness but if you would just read the
[1:09:52] story of job and look at him he's
[1:09:54] looking over his whole whole life and
[1:09:55] he's questioning why am I here you know
[1:09:59] why because everything had been
[1:10:02] took it wasn't just one thing it was a
[1:10:05] combination one right after the other he
[1:10:08] lost
[1:10:09] everything Satan's combination was not
[1:10:12] only to take his business and his
[1:10:14] livelihood he took his children all of
[1:10:16] his children died then after his
[1:10:18] children he lost his his farm his goods
[1:10:21] and then his wife turned to him and said
[1:10:23] you might as well Curse God and die his
[1:10:26] relationships failed God allowed every
[1:10:30] relationship he was in to try and
[1:10:32] question his faith in God and on top of
[1:10:35] everything else he lost his
[1:10:38] health what do you think his spiritual
[1:10:40] condition was like that
[1:10:42] day my
[1:10:44] God and it made him question why he was
[1:10:47] even born and he's kneeling there on
[1:10:50] that Ash sheep and his wife bends down
[1:10:52] and she begins to whisper in his ear
[1:10:55] curse him and he's kneeling there on
[1:10:58] that as sheep and his wife bends she
[1:11:00] bends down and says that and you know
[1:11:02] what job
[1:11:04] did he said you speak like a foolish
[1:11:07] woman fell down and he worshiped God
[1:11:11] Amen now he did not understand what he
[1:11:14] was going through he didn't understand
[1:11:16] why he was going through
[1:11:19] it but he knew he had to worship God no
[1:11:22] matter what and I want you to know you
[1:11:25] Al may not going through pain may be so
[1:11:29] great that you don't know how to fight
[1:11:30] it and you may be so weary that it's
[1:11:32] hard for you to stand but I want you to
[1:11:34] know this don't ever give up you always
[1:11:39] worship God for that's the greatest
[1:11:43] Victory I said that's the greatest
[1:11:46] victory in God's
[1:11:48] eyes not so much the Divine Healing but
[1:11:51] a man that could sit there and lose
[1:11:53] everything and said I still Worship You
[1:11:56] Lord I'll never give up on you I'll
[1:11:59] never turn back I'm part of this and I
[1:12:02] don't care how many disappointments come
[1:12:03] I don't care if I lose my business I
[1:12:05] don't I lose it all I'll not lose my
[1:12:09] God hallelujah
[1:12:12] hallelujah look at job's trouble and
[1:12:15] I'll just read down through scures in
[1:12:16] job
[1:12:17] 10:20 uh to
[1:12:19] 22 are not my days few cease then he
[1:12:23] said and let me alone that I may take
[1:12:26] comfort a
[1:12:27] little before I go when I shall not
[1:12:30] return even to the land of darkness and
[1:12:32] the shadow of death amen a land of
[1:12:36] Darkness as Darkness itself and of the
[1:12:38] shadow of death without any order and
[1:12:41] where the light is in
[1:12:43] darkness in Job
[1:12:45] 14 he says for there is hope of a tree
[1:12:49] it can be cut down that it will Sprout
[1:12:53] again and that the tender branch thereof
[1:12:55] will not
[1:12:56] cease though the root thereof wax old in
[1:12:59] the earth and the stock thereof die in
[1:13:01] the ground yet through the scent of
[1:13:04] water it will
[1:13:05] Bud oh I love that to think of that I've
[1:13:10] the tree I've watched it withered down
[1:13:11] to nothing till it's dead all the way
[1:13:14] down to the ground yet at the scent of
[1:13:17] water for the water is being poured out
[1:13:20] and you may also be dead all the way to
[1:13:22] the ground but at the scent of water it
[1:13:24] will sprout again that tender Branch
[1:13:27] will not cease maybe today you've got
[1:13:30] spiritual Amnesia maybe you forgot who
[1:13:32] you were you thought maybe I'm not even
[1:13:34] part of this thing anymore but I want
[1:13:36] you to know you may be dead all the way
[1:13:38] to the ground but the scent of water is
[1:13:39] in in your nostrils just now it jogs
[1:13:42] your memory amen and it causes you to
[1:13:44] live for him like you did before and I
[1:13:47] want you to know you're going to sprout
[1:13:49] again and you're going to live for him
[1:13:50] again why because you were planted by
[1:13:54] God not by man amen Isaiah 61 says these
[1:13:59] are the plannings of the Lord that he
[1:14:01] might be
[1:14:03] glorified if you're sitting here today
[1:14:05] and are under the grips of Satan and
[1:14:07] don't know how to break free I want you
[1:14:08] to know amen he said fear
[1:14:12] not I am he that was alive and was dead
[1:14:16] and liveth again I took the keys of
[1:14:19] death and Hell Satan does not have the
[1:14:23] keys Satan cannot take you anywhere
[1:14:26] unless God first unlocks the
[1:14:29] door he can't take you anywhere unless
[1:14:32] God first unlocks the door and allows
[1:14:34] him to do it amen which means Satan is
[1:14:37] only serving God's
[1:14:40] purpose there is hope of a tree if it be
[1:14:43] cut down that it will Sprout again the
[1:14:47] tender Branch thereof will not cease
[1:14:50] though the root thereof wax old in the
[1:14:52] earth and the stock thereof die in the
[1:14:55] ground and yet through the scent of
[1:14:58] water it will bud and will bring forth
[1:15:01] bows like a plant can you imagine today
[1:15:05] living completely without fear what
[1:15:07] would it truly mean to live
[1:15:10] Fearless that would be perfect
[1:15:13] faith and as God's Prophet said give me
[1:15:15] someone who's walking in faith living in
[1:15:17] faith he said that person is already in
[1:15:20] a raptured condition they're prepared
[1:15:24] ready for the next step no more fear
[1:15:27] just living in faith and Truth to think
[1:15:30] that God hasn't given us a spirit of
[1:15:33] fear what an encouraging thought for a
[1:15:35] Believer facing demons and facing
[1:15:38] sickness and facing superstitions and
[1:15:40] facing idolatry and facing
[1:15:42] lifethreatening situations that God
[1:15:44] didn't give us the spirit of fear today
[1:15:48] Satan sends fear and as a Believer under
[1:15:50] the New Covenant scripture says these
[1:15:52] signs will follow them that
[1:15:56] they'll cast out devils in my name you
[1:15:59] have God's Authority so fear not don't
[1:16:03] make room for fear your duty as a
[1:16:07] Believer is to cast out fear to open
[1:16:10] your heart's door and to declare you
[1:16:13] won't Harbor here you won't live here
[1:16:16] you won't find place in my family
[1:16:19] scripture says give no place to the
[1:16:21] devil imagine if every believer here
[1:16:24] said fear you're not hiding in my soul
[1:16:27] you're not using my life to blend into
[1:16:29] the church I cast you out in jesus' name
[1:16:32] this building would overflow with
[1:16:34] Faith's power healing sickness and
[1:16:36] changing lives amen power would fill
[1:16:40] every heart because fear wouldn't rule
[1:16:42] anymore if every believer did their part
[1:16:45] J God chose your heart as a throne as
[1:16:48] Revelation place but fear has brought
[1:16:52] imaginations into your soul yes
[1:16:55] imagination sits where Faith should be
[1:16:57] sitting Revelation should be on your
[1:16:59] heart's throne but fear sits there
[1:17:02] instead you're imagining you'll fail
[1:17:05] imagining you can't make it and that
[1:17:07] lying devil tells you that you're
[1:17:10] Christian but you'll soon
[1:17:12] fall you can't live this life you won't
[1:17:15] make it look how other people aren't
[1:17:17] making it how will you make it look what
[1:17:21] the devil does the fear he puts on you
[1:17:24] but Abraham God sends this message to
[1:17:27] Believers that I didn't put fear in your
[1:17:31] heart so cast out your imagination
[1:17:34] scripture says cast down imaginations
[1:17:36] everything exalting itself above God's
[1:17:39] word amen and let me tell you what God's
[1:17:42] word brings God's word brings shity it
[1:17:45] brings truth it brings power it brings
[1:17:48] Deliverance it brings Liberty it brings
[1:17:51] peace it brings security it brings love
[1:17:55] yeah think about young David he was he
[1:17:59] was an
[1:18:00] afterthought of his family when the
[1:18:03] prophet came to anoint the next king he
[1:18:06] dealt with family rejection he wasn't
[1:18:09] included he wasn't even considered by
[1:18:12] his family but he was anointed by a
[1:18:14] prophet he was anointed to be a king he
[1:18:18] was anointed to slay Giants and when
[1:18:20] there was a Goliath in the land the
[1:18:22] Bible says in in 1 Samuel
[1:18:25] 1716 and the Philistine Drew near
[1:18:28] morning and evening and presented
[1:18:30] himself 40 days and I asked myself while
[1:18:34] studying this why would it be
[1:18:36] significant that the prophet who wrote
[1:18:38] this text mentioned that
[1:18:41] Goliath himself morning and evening and
[1:18:46] I found it significant because Believers
[1:18:48] in the morning and in the evening they
[1:18:51] would pray and recite scripture maybe
[1:18:54] through the day they are working but
[1:18:55] morning and evening was their time to
[1:18:58] pray and recite scripture and this
[1:19:01] devotion time was called the Shema and
[1:19:03] the sheema means to hear or listen and
[1:19:07] they would quote from Deuteronomy 64 to5
[1:19:10] which I feel is a very important
[1:19:12] scripture and we'll see exactly why
[1:19:15] evening and morning is why sat the devil
[1:19:18] Satan Goliath stood and and tried to
[1:19:21] distract the people here o Israel the
[1:19:23] Lord our God is one you shall love the
[1:19:26] Lord your God with all your heart with
[1:19:28] all your soul and with all your might
[1:19:31] and the they prayed these words as kind
[1:19:32] of a a pledge of allegiance if you will
[1:19:35] and so we find the giant of distraction
[1:19:38] was there during their time of Devotion
[1:19:40] to the Lord and he knew how to take the
[1:19:42] legs out from under a Believer amen but
[1:19:45] this little rejected boy who wasn't
[1:19:48] included with the crowd he was on the
[1:19:50] backside of some pasture somewhere he
[1:19:53] was Sanctified from the commotion he
[1:19:55] probably had a dirty face he probably
[1:19:57] came down the lane whistling some new
[1:19:59] Psalm he was coming up twisting his uh
[1:20:02] his slingshot
[1:20:04] nonchalant back and forth he strolled
[1:20:06] into the battlefield one day because his
[1:20:07] dad sent him out there to deliver food
[1:20:10] to his brothers amen but we found when
[1:20:14] he arrived there was an entire Army
[1:20:16] failing for
[1:20:18] fear and you can imagine they saw him
[1:20:21] and they asked him what's in your hand
[1:20:24] and brother Brandon said in 55 what's in
[1:20:26] thine hand he said what's in your hand
[1:20:30] he said a slingshot amen how you going
[1:20:33] to fight that giant out there with a 15
[1:20:36] or 20 foot spear you couldn't get near
[1:20:38] him the way to defeat that type of enemy
[1:20:41] is just to keep distance from it the
[1:20:43] enemy of distraction keeping you out of
[1:20:45] the word keeping you crippled by fear
[1:20:48] and Little David whipped around his
[1:20:49] sling and cracked the stone through the
[1:20:51] skull of the Giant and brother Brenham
[1:20:53] said it would break the sound barrier
[1:20:55] and to think when things were unstable
[1:20:57] in the
[1:20:58] land the rock of faith is aimed at the
[1:21:00] enemy's head and by his own sword he's
[1:21:04] beheaded amen behead that giant things
[1:21:08] might be a little shaky but it's time to
[1:21:11] accelerate there's this uh when I was
[1:21:14] studying this I found this so so cool so
[1:21:16] interesting how this came together man
[1:21:18] named Chuck joerger some of you might
[1:21:20] have heard of him I think brother
[1:21:21] Brandon mentioned him actually uh he was
[1:21:23] the first man to break the sound barrier
[1:21:26] in in
[1:21:27] 1947 and he had a plane called The Bell
[1:21:30] X1 aircraft and he was interviewed and
[1:21:34] asked what his motivation was for doing
[1:21:36] this and he said when I was picked to
[1:21:38] fly the X1 it was my duty to fly it so I
[1:21:41] did it so he had a commission and he
[1:21:43] fulfilled the commission he said at high
[1:21:45] speeds the plane began to shake
[1:21:47] violently and he was afraid it would
[1:21:49] Shake something loose and it would it
[1:21:51] would crash he was already going fast
[1:21:54] and so he had three choices he could
[1:21:56] stay at that speed where everything
[1:21:57] around him was shaking and we'll call
[1:21:59] that the Pentecostal speed all right or
[1:22:01] he could slow down into the times of the
[1:22:04] past and go Leisure speed or he could
[1:22:07] press Full Throttle and push past the
[1:22:10] shaking and into an atmosphere a realm
[1:22:13] that has never been reached before and
[1:22:15] let me just say this today it's no
[1:22:17] coincidence that brother brandom's first
[1:22:19] recorded message in 1947 it's called
[1:22:22] faith is the substance and and we had a
[1:22:24] prophet in our day despite the
[1:22:26] instability of the world and despite the
[1:22:28] fear of breaking apart broke into an
[1:22:31] atmosphere of that other dimension
[1:22:33] because it was his duty it was his
[1:22:35] commission so why would you fear today
[1:22:39] think of how Paul tells a of his Warfare
[1:22:41] in Ephesians 6 we're not wrestling
[1:22:44] against flesh and blood but against
[1:22:46] principalities powers and the rulers of
[1:22:49] Darkness spiritual wickedness so your
[1:22:52] Warfare isn't natural it's
[1:22:56] spiritual you must go to realm to find
[1:23:00] victory over your life's enemy and Paul
[1:23:03] said our weapons aren't carnal this
[1:23:06] isn't a carnal battle but it's
[1:23:08] spiritual he's saying he won't give you
[1:23:12] physical weapons instead Paul gave
[1:23:14] what's mighty for tearing down spiritual
[1:23:17] strongholds amen it's near you it's in
[1:23:20] your mouth and what William Brandon
[1:23:23] preached was what Paul preed preached
[1:23:25] that Faith you've received from Paul's
[1:23:27] message is now in your mouth and how do
[1:23:30] we know this Revelation 109 says the
[1:23:34] angel took the book and said eat it
[1:23:37] where will it be in your mouth so
[1:23:39] Warfare rest in your mouth today thus

[1:24:13] the
[1:24:13] scripture in Ephesians
[1:24:16] 6 Paul would show us our defenses the
[1:24:19] helmet the shod fee that's
[1:24:22] defenses but Paul Paul turns to the
[1:24:25] sword of the spirit which is God's word
[1:24:29] so Paul's saying we're not just wearing
[1:24:31] defensive armor to withstand the devil's
[1:24:34] attack God's putting something in your
[1:24:36] hand to drive back your attacking
[1:24:39] enemy take what's over your life today
[1:24:41] and cast it beneath your feet and let
[1:24:43] the devil know Satan you're under my
[1:24:45] feet I won't listen I won't bow I won't
[1:24:48] Bend we're not helpless and we're not
[1:24:51] harmless we're Christ's bride with the
[1:24:53] word in the sword of the spirit we're
[1:24:56] Invincible we won't stop we won't be
[1:24:59] beaten we won't be driven back we'll
[1:25:02] overcome through the Lord's word the
[1:25:05] blood of the lamb and the word of Our
[1:25:08] Testimony we have this right casting
[1:25:10] down every imagination throwing demons
[1:25:12] beneath our feet you ask if you can do
[1:25:15] it everyone here has the commission to
[1:25:18] cast down your
[1:25:19] enemy amen Hebrews 4:12 says God's word
[1:25:23] is and powerful and sharper than any
[1:25:26] two-edged sword the word is powerful the
[1:25:29] word is sharp and the word is
[1:25:32] able and that's why scripture said they
[1:25:34] that overcome in Revelation 12 by the
[1:25:37] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[1:25:39] testimony and you recognize today there
[1:25:41] are many strongholds you've got to
[1:25:43] recognize it for a stronghold amen do
[1:25:47] you know that depression is a stronghold
[1:25:49] and do you know that anxiety is a
[1:25:51] stronghold of the enemy and it's amazing
[1:25:54] that we're taught that these things are
[1:25:55] connected by
[1:25:57] fear David in his later years would fall
[1:26:01] into the
[1:26:02] stronghold I'll read 1st Samuel 21:10
[1:26:06] to14 and David Rose and fled that day
[1:26:10] for fear of Saul and he went to akish
[1:26:13] the king of gath and the Servants of
[1:26:15] akish said unto him is not this David
[1:26:19] the king of the land did they not sing
[1:26:22] one to another of him and dance saying
[1:26:24] Saul hath slain his thousands and David
[1:26:27] his 10 thousands and David laid up these
[1:26:30] words in his heart and was sore afraid
[1:26:33] of akish the king of gath and he changed
[1:26:36] his behavior before him and feigned
[1:26:38] himself mad in their hands and scrabbled
[1:26:40] on the doors in the gate and let his
[1:26:43] spittle fall down his beard then aish
[1:26:45] unto his servants said lo you see this
[1:26:48] man is mad wherefore then have you
[1:26:51] brought him to me now fear will make a
[1:26:54] king act
[1:26:58] insane to for fear running to gath and
[1:27:02] acting insane to cover up his complexes
[1:27:05] and to protect himself and he became a
[1:27:07] little bit paranoid he forgets his
[1:27:09] identity he gets spiritual Amnesia calls
[1:27:12] it spiritual
[1:27:13] Amnesia David he he to a himc the
[1:27:18] priests and then David came to KN to ahc
[1:27:21] the priest and ahc was afraid at the the
[1:27:24] meeting of David and said unto him why
[1:27:25] art thou alone and no man with thee and
[1:27:29] David said unto himc the priest the king
[1:27:32] hath commanded me a business and hath
[1:27:34] said unto me let no man know anything of
[1:27:38] the business whereabout I send thee and
[1:27:41] what I have commanded thee and I have
[1:27:43] appointed my servants to such and such a
[1:27:46] place now therefore is understood thine
[1:27:49] what now therefore what is under thine
[1:27:52] Give Me Five Loaves of bread in mine
[1:27:55] hand are what there is present and the
[1:27:57] priest answered David and said there is
[1:27:59] no common bread under my hand but there
[1:28:01] is a hollowed bread if the young men
[1:28:03] kept themselves at least from women and
[1:28:06] David said unto ahc and is there not
[1:28:09] here under thine hand a spear or a sword
[1:28:12] now watch this for I have neither
[1:28:14] brought my sword nor my weapons with me
[1:28:17] because the king's business required
[1:28:19] haste and the priest said the sword of
[1:28:21] Goliath the Philistine whom thou slew
[1:28:24] in the valley of elaw behold it is here
[1:28:27] wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if
[1:28:30] thou will take that for there is no
[1:28:33] other save that here and David said
[1:28:36] there is none like that give it me now
[1:28:39] when David arrives at KN and and speaks
[1:28:42] priests and when the priest hands him
[1:28:44] the sword of Goliath David begins to
[1:28:46] remember his past
[1:28:49] victories and that he has been anointed
[1:28:51] to be king and that the Lord Pro divides
[1:28:55] and maybe some of you have been there
[1:28:57] you come to church defeated and
[1:28:58] distracted and and and fearful but you
[1:29:01] see the sword that cut the devil's head
[1:29:03] off and you begin to remember if it did
[1:29:05] it once it can do it again it just needs
[1:29:07] a hand of Faith to yield it amen
[1:29:10] remember the victories and the Triumph
[1:29:12] restore me back to my
[1:29:14] position help me to overcome complexes
[1:29:17] and
[1:29:18] fear and it put David in a position
[1:29:21] where he was able to sing I Will Bless
[1:29:23] The Lord at all
[1:29:25] times his praise shall I Contin his
[1:29:28] praise shall continually be in my mouth
[1:29:31] my soul shall make her boast in the Lord
[1:29:35] The Humble shall hear thereof and be
[1:29:37] glad he said oh magnify the Lord with me
[1:29:41] and let us exalt his name together I
[1:29:43] sought the Lord and he heard me and
[1:29:46] delivered me from all my fears they
[1:29:48] looked unto him and were lighted and
[1:29:50] their faces were not ashamed this poor
[1:29:53] man cried and the the Lord heard me and
[1:29:55] saved me out of all of my troubles amen
[1:29:58] and watch the prophet as he addresses
[1:30:01] complexes there was these two Christian
[1:30:04] twin girls that moved into a city and
[1:30:07] one one of them stays solid in the faith
[1:30:09] and uh she had no issues with dresses or
[1:30:12] the long hair the other one gets around
[1:30:15] school girls and reasoning enters her
[1:30:17] mind she thinks well they go to church
[1:30:19] and and they dress different and they
[1:30:21] cut their hair why can't I and you got
[1:30:24] to remember today this isn't about man's
[1:30:27] reasoning it's it's not about fear of of
[1:30:29] what other people think it's about
[1:30:31] obedience to the word of God and that
[1:30:34] little school girl she got confused and
[1:30:36] caught between two opinions and she
[1:30:38] developed spiritual Amnesia she lost her
[1:30:41] identity and she built complexes and she
[1:30:43] ended in an insane
[1:30:45] institution and brother brandom said she
[1:30:48] didn't speak for 2 years her parents
[1:30:51] came to him for help and brother bham
[1:30:53] visited and Vision came and he said thus
[1:30:56] sayith the Lord shall be completely
[1:30:59] healed the little girl's mother nudged
[1:31:01] her and said just think of it he's never
[1:31:04] been wrong amen within only a few hours
[1:31:08] that same day they called brother
[1:31:10] brandom and the girl had fully
[1:31:12] recovered think of it he's never been
[1:31:15] wrong and what else did he say he said
[1:31:18] there would be a bride that would come
[1:31:19] to
[1:31:20] herself he said there would be a Rapture
[1:31:23] he he said an angel appeared and said
[1:31:25] not even cancer could stand before him
[1:31:29] amen it's only
[1:31:31] fear brother Brenham said fear in this
[1:31:33] hour he says watch fearful sights are
[1:31:36] everywhere fear is everywhere the Bible
[1:31:40] says men men's hearts are failing for
[1:31:42] fear but the message of the hour comes
[1:31:45] along and the prophets looking at the
[1:31:47] same thing that they're looking at he's
[1:31:50] looking at fears he's looking at
[1:31:53] insecurity s he's looking at complexes
[1:31:57] he lost his child and he lost his wife
[1:32:00] and people turned on him people talk bad
[1:32:03] about him he had many friends but really
[1:32:07] he had no friends if you understand what
[1:32:09] I mean there but he had
[1:32:11] Jesus and despite everything he says to
[1:32:15] the church he says
[1:32:18] shalom shalom to the church don't fear
[1:32:23] he says shalom LOM peace to the
[1:32:25] church he said the reason things are
[1:32:28] getting so bad he said because the
[1:32:30] lights is pressing the darkness together
[1:32:33] the reason things are falling apart is
[1:32:36] because the rock is coming the stone has
[1:32:39] been heed the mountain the economies and
[1:32:42] the World Systems they've they've got to
[1:32:44] go but we are not to fear what's
[1:32:46] happening it's God bringing Mercy to his
[1:32:51] church the Apostle Paul could say fear
[1:32:54] not Jesus could say fear not and brother
[1:32:58] brandham could say fear not Shalom and I
[1:33:01] think of David the psalmist in Psalms 23
[1:33:05] when he's saying I will fear no as I
[1:33:09] walk through that Valley has nothing to
[1:33:12] do with who I am or what I do amen but I
[1:33:15] will fear no evil for thou are with me
[1:33:19] why was the prophet speaking to the
[1:33:21] church Shalom and not fear
[1:33:24] it's because he was introducing to the
[1:33:26] church that Christ has come among you
[1:33:29] it's not time to fear it's time to
[1:33:33] believe this is not a fearful time this
[1:33:36] is a time to believe I will fear no evil
[1:33:40] for thou art with me Amen in Isaiah 43
[1:33:44] the prophet Isaiah says very clearly
[1:33:47] thus sayith the Lord that created thee
[1:33:49] oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh
[1:33:52] Israel fear not I have redeemed Thee the
[1:33:57] world cannot touch you you are here with
[1:34:00] an anointing of the son of man you have
[1:34:03] come into the word of the hour we are
[1:34:07] here to drive back that enemy we're not
[1:34:10] here to be destroyed we're not here to
[1:34:13] fall we're not here to be today we're
[1:34:18] we're we're not here to be cast down but
[1:34:21] we're here to fulfill the word of the
[1:34:24] hour
[1:34:26] amen this bride is not going backwards
[1:34:29] in Retreat we're not returning back to
[1:34:32] how things used to be going forward
[1:34:34] we're pressing on we're going into the
[1:34:37] promises of God this is the hour for a
[1:34:41] Believer the Holy Ghost has a message
[1:34:43] for you the spirit has one message for a
[1:34:47] Believer speak the word and go
[1:34:50] forward you are to go forward today over
[1:34:53] your adversary go forward today over
[1:34:56] your sickness go forward today over your
[1:34:59] complexes go forward today over your
[1:35:02] fears you're to speak the word and take
[1:35:05] a step but you say brother Nick there's
[1:35:09] no way how do I take a step there's no
[1:35:11] way out of here there's no place to go
[1:35:14] but the Bible tells us even in the time
[1:35:15] of Joshua when they came up to the River
[1:35:17] Jordan if you recall that when the high
[1:35:20] priest put his foot in the water there
[1:35:22] was no way until he made the first step
[1:35:26] and then God moved and he made the
[1:35:28] opening amen someone had to be the first
[1:35:31] one to take a step and I wonder today is
[1:35:33] there a believer in the house of God
[1:35:36] that will take a step of faith and speak
[1:35:38] the word and move
[1:35:39] forward be not afraid it is I the Lord
[1:35:43] Has Come among you he is here to deliver
[1:35:46] and he is here to give
[1:35:47] power
[1:35:49] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:54] but watch this watch this back in job 19
[1:35:57] something begins to come to him and it's
[1:36:00] a little different than what he was
[1:36:02] saying
[1:36:03] before before it was
[1:36:06] darkness and before it was fear and
[1:36:08] before it was
[1:36:10] questioning but now he says for I know
[1:36:12] my redeemer lives he sees the Redeemer
[1:36:15] and when he sees the Redeemer it causes
[1:36:18] him to see himself he says for I know
[1:36:21] that my redeemer liveth that he shall
[1:36:24] stand at the latter day upon the Earth
[1:36:27] and though after my skin worms destroy
[1:36:29] this body yet in my flesh I will see God
[1:36:35] and that's the
[1:36:36] difference that's different than what he
[1:36:38] had said earlier
[1:36:40] amen earlier it's a land of Darkness I
[1:36:43] don't know what happens after death but
[1:36:45] now he says though the skin worms
[1:36:47] destroy this body yet in my flesh I will
[1:36:51] see God
[1:36:53] so been given a hope for Resurrection
[1:36:56] amen yeah now let's go to Job
[1:37:01] 38 then the Lord answered job out of the
[1:37:04] Whirlwind and said who is this that
[1:37:06] darkeneth counsel by the words without
[1:37:09] knowledge and by the way I forgot to put
[1:37:12] my timer on so we're here till we're
[1:37:14] done
[1:37:16] amen G up now thy loins like a man for I
[1:37:20] will demand of thee and answer thou me
[1:37:24] where were you see now he's giving him a
[1:37:27] message about the mind of God where were
[1:37:31] you when I laid the foundation you're
[1:37:33] worried about what's after but this
[1:37:36] message is here to tell you about what's
[1:37:39] before amen for what's
[1:37:43] before if your answer was after I hope I
[1:37:47] hope you understand what this message
[1:37:49] came to do it's not a message of what's
[1:37:51] before it's a message of what's after
[1:37:53] after it's a message of what's in the
[1:37:55] mind of God in fact the prophet stood on
[1:37:57] the platform and he would say I want to
[1:38:00] preach to you what was in the mind of
[1:38:02] God what God had in his mind before the
[1:38:04] foundation of the world we're going to
[1:38:06] see by God's help he said he unfolded it
[1:38:09] all the way down into the present time
[1:38:12] that we're living in amen think about it
[1:38:15] think about this church all the way down
[1:38:18] before time began don't worry about
[1:38:21] what's after let's find out where you
[1:38:23] were before death ever
[1:38:26] was where were where were you when I
[1:38:29] laid the foundations of the earth
[1:38:31] declare if thou Hast understanding do
[1:38:34] you understand do you understand the
[1:38:37] language that's been given to us when he
[1:38:40] says I'm predestinated when he says I
[1:38:43] was with God before the foundation of
[1:38:45] the world where were you yeah job just
[1:38:49] said I don't know because it was all
[1:38:51] Darkness to him but this message has
[1:38:53] brought light to you these are these are
[1:38:56] precious things in in the eyes of God do
[1:38:59] you see that think about what he's
[1:39:01] saying God's asking you a question this
[1:39:04] morning declare if you have
[1:39:06] understanding what I've just asked you
[1:39:09] where were you and if you understand
[1:39:12] where you were it will change your whole
[1:39:15] life it will change your whole approach
[1:39:18] to the enemy for the Bible says Don't
[1:39:22] Fear Satan fear
[1:39:24] God when the morning Stars sang together
[1:39:27] and sons of God shouted for Joy God was
[1:39:31] answering job's question by causing him
[1:39:33] to look at him who was before the
[1:39:37] darkness the fear of death and hell has
[1:39:40] held billions in bondage to the unknown
[1:39:44] the fear of seeing themselves walk down
[1:39:46] the same path that thousands and
[1:39:49] thousands of others have walked down
[1:39:51] with the same symptoms and that triumph
[1:39:55] over man
[1:39:57] fear but when Jesus took the keys from
[1:40:00] Satan he lost his power over the people
[1:40:05] all the superstitions were replaced with
[1:40:07] faith and a risen savior amen listen to
[1:40:12] this if Satan holds the keys of death
[1:40:15] he's telling the people they're hid from
[1:40:17] The Secret of
[1:40:19] immortality they don't know what
[1:40:21] immortality is but Paul comes along
[1:40:24] after Jesus rose and he says this
[1:40:26] corruptible must put on incorruption
[1:40:29] Amen and this Mortal must put on
[1:40:33] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:40:35] shall have put on incorruption this
[1:40:38] Mortal shall have put on
[1:40:40] immortality then shall be brought to
[1:40:43] pass the saying that is written death is
[1:40:46] swallowed up in Victory he said oh death
[1:40:49] where is thy sting oh grave where is thy
[1:40:52] victory
[1:40:54] oh my oh grave where is thy
[1:40:58] Victory The Sting of death is sin the
[1:41:02] strength of sin is the law but thanks be
[1:41:06] to God which giveth us Victory through
[1:41:09] our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my
[1:41:12] beloved Brethren be ye steadfast
[1:41:15] unmovable always abounding in the work
[1:41:18] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[1:41:21] your labor is not in vain the
[1:41:24] Lord and this is why brother brandom
[1:41:26] said when Paul is being brought out to
[1:41:29] the chopping block and he lays his head
[1:41:31] down there and and you know death should
[1:41:33] cause fear to come upon a person but he
[1:41:36] wasn't
[1:41:37] fearful at The Chopping Block he looked
[1:41:40] at that old place and brother Brenham
[1:41:42] said in the message the angel of the
[1:41:45] Lord he said that the grave said I'm
[1:41:49] going to hold your body but Paul said
[1:41:53] you're trying to scare me but you can't
[1:41:56] scare me grave where is your
[1:42:00] Victory Satan has lost his keys he can
[1:42:04] hide in religion but his strength has
[1:42:06] been stripped from him amen and if his
[1:42:10] strength has been stripped from him who
[1:42:12] is stronger than him that's able to
[1:42:15] strip his strength our Lord am remember
[1:42:19] Satan says you're finished it's over
[1:42:22] he's doing that because he looks like
[1:42:24] he's got an army behind him Satan thinks
[1:42:27] he has all the odds against you and he
[1:42:30] really pours it on but remember now if
[1:42:33] the Lord Jesus has the keys of death and
[1:42:35] hell then he left all of those keys
[1:42:38] through the scriptures for us
[1:42:41] amen you're a winner and Satan is
[1:42:44] defeated all throughout the
[1:42:46] Bible you understand every one of these
[1:42:49] stories that we read about they started
[1:42:51] with certain defeats staring them in the
[1:42:54] face come on you guys see that right
[1:42:57] come on Church you're no different than
[1:43:00] anybody else in the Bible just the name
[1:43:03] has changed but it's still the same
[1:43:05] devil the difference is he's lost his
[1:43:09] keys there he had keys now he has no
[1:43:13] keys amen and when the word begins to
[1:43:16] mean more to you than death and life we
[1:43:20] understand that this word is power this
[1:43:23] word is Majesty this word is a
[1:43:25] declaration of independence before the
[1:43:27] enemy this word has prepared a table
[1:43:31] before my enemy he anointeth me in the
[1:43:34] presence of my enemy
[1:43:37] amen where were
[1:43:41] you where were you when the sons of
[1:43:44] shouted when the morning Stars
[1:43:47] sang where God is are shouts amen where
[1:43:52] God is
[1:43:53] is vict songs of praise songs of
[1:43:57] testimony trophies in the house of God
[1:44:00] are testimonies of the
[1:44:02] Saints and bear with me I'm laying a
[1:44:08] foundation but notice where did these
[1:44:11] testimonies come
[1:44:13] from they came from the
[1:44:16] enemy Satan has lost Keys Satan has lost
[1:44:20] his victory Satan has lost his power
[1:44:23] over you his power to hold you down his
[1:44:27] power to keep you defeated his power to
[1:44:29] tell you that you're not a son of God
[1:44:32] why do you think brother brandham said
[1:44:34] in in Christ is the mystery why is the
[1:44:36] devil howling let's read that quote but
[1:44:40] I'm talking about the headship of Christ
[1:44:42] notice being personally identified by
[1:44:46] the original headship we have the answer
[1:44:49] to the devil's question this morning we
[1:44:52] have the the answer to the devil's
[1:44:55] question Christ is risen and has paid
[1:44:58] the price and raising up a body the
[1:45:02] devil can't stand it that's the reason
[1:45:05] these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up
[1:45:07] that's the reason they're all coming
[1:45:09] into what they're doing now the devil
[1:45:12] that's the reason he's howling the way
[1:45:15] he is his wickedness has been uncovered
[1:45:19] by the Risen
[1:45:20] Resurrection Christ yes in the head over
[1:45:24] his body
[1:45:26] Glory you know why he's howling because
[1:45:30] he sees the light of immortality coming
[1:45:33] over the
[1:45:34] horizon the devil is going to see a
[1:45:39] resurrection I said the devil is going
[1:45:42] to see a
[1:45:44] resurrection that's why theil is howling
[1:45:48] it's going home time amen we're leaving
[1:45:51] there's a rapture taking place so long
[1:45:55] Goodbye World I don't know about you
[1:45:59] that makes me
[1:46:00] happy
[1:46:03] good goodbye sin goodbye to this world
[1:46:07] my
[1:46:09] my but in case some of you are still a
[1:46:12] little worried and don't know if we've
[1:46:14] really got the
[1:46:16] victory let me show what what the Lord
[1:46:19] showed us in type and Shadow and you
[1:46:22] remember there was a a man in the Bible
[1:46:24] named
[1:46:25] Gideon who was fearful he was fearful he
[1:46:29] was
[1:46:30] scared when he was trying to get
[1:46:32] anything from God he hid behind the wine
[1:46:34] press because because of the power of
[1:46:38] the enemy
[1:46:39] amen he was told by an Angel in judges
[1:46:44] 6:23 do not
[1:46:46] fear and yet he was still afraid to face
[1:46:49] the
[1:46:50] enemy the oppression of the enemy was
[1:46:53] everywhere so he hid to try to get his
[1:46:55] blessings amen you know he's he's one of
[1:46:59] those Believers that just sneak in and
[1:47:01] and sneak out amen but the Lord appeared
[1:47:05] to him and said Mighty Man of
[1:47:08] Valor and he said Lord I'm the least in
[1:47:11] my household how could I and he said
[1:47:14] you're a mighty man of Valor I have
[1:47:17] caused you I have called you and I have
[1:47:20] raised you up to deliver Israel from
[1:47:22] from the hands of these powers and there
[1:47:25] were three powers there were midianites
[1:47:29] there were amalekites and there were
[1:47:30] children of the East amen the Bible said
[1:47:34] that they came without number they ate
[1:47:36] up the grass drove the people out of
[1:47:39] their homes till they lived in dens and
[1:47:41] caves of the
[1:47:43] earth and in judges
[1:47:46] 7:9 the Bible says and it came to pass
[1:47:50] the same night that the Lord s unto to
[1:47:53] him arise and get thee down unto the
[1:47:55] host for I have delivered it into thine
[1:47:59] hand so this is what God had already
[1:48:01] promised him he said just attack you've
[1:48:05] got the
[1:48:07] victory but if thou
[1:48:10] fear goe with FOH thy servant down to
[1:48:14] the host and thou shalt hear what they
[1:48:16] say and afterward shall thine hands be
[1:48:20] strengthened to go unto F unto the host
[1:48:23] then went down with Pharaoh then he went
[1:48:25] down to with Pharaoh his servant unto
[1:48:28] the house of the Armed men that were in
[1:48:31] the host so Gideon if you're afraid to
[1:48:36] attack I want you to go down and I want
[1:48:38] you to listen to what your enemy is
[1:48:40] saying about you and afterward you'll be
[1:48:43] encouraged and you'll be confident
[1:48:47] amen and the midianites and the
[1:48:49] amalekites and all the children of the
[1:48:51] East lay along in the valley like
[1:48:53] grasshoppers for for multitude and their
[1:48:55] cam camels were without number as the
[1:48:58] Sand by the Sea by the seaside for
[1:49:01] multitude and Gideon arrived just as a
[1:49:06] man so Gideon he's there now he's eased
[1:49:09] dropping on the enemy he's listening
[1:49:11] into what they're saying and the enemy
[1:49:14] said that a man is is he's telling a
[1:49:17] friend his dream he said I had a dream
[1:49:19] that a round loaf of barley bread came
[1:49:22] tumbling into the
[1:49:24] midianite and it struck the tent with
[1:49:26] such a force that the tent was
[1:49:28] overturned and collapsed and his friend
[1:49:31] responded this can be nothing other than
[1:49:33] the sword of Gideon now Gideon he's
[1:49:37] facing an enemy that's about
[1:49:39] 250,000 troops and he begins with about
[1:49:44] 32,000 so he's got like a small tiny
[1:49:47] Fighting
[1:49:48] Chance and one day 22,000 people from
[1:49:52] that army they decided that they don't
[1:49:53] want the fight they're not interested in
[1:49:56] fighting 250,000 people so he's down to
[1:49:59] a much smaller number then the number of
[1:50:03] 10,000
[1:50:04] 9,700 walk away so we find that they're
[1:50:09] all Idol worshippers and they're fearful
[1:50:11] and he's left with 300 men
[1:50:14] amen
[1:50:16] normally that's a really bad day so
[1:50:20] there's no chance no possibility that
[1:50:23] 300 men can take on
[1:50:25] 250,000 that's actually terrifying
[1:50:29] odds and so God gives Gideon some advice
[1:50:32] he says he says I want you to go listen
[1:50:35] to what your enemy is
[1:50:37] saying he didn't send him to an apostle
[1:50:41] and he didn't send him to a prophet and
[1:50:43] he did not give him another Angelic
[1:50:45] visitation he already had those
[1:50:47] experiences and he knew what the
[1:50:48] scriptures said about the victories of
[1:50:51] Joshua and the others that went before
[1:50:52] for him but he was still
[1:50:54] fearful he still doubted so God said
[1:50:58] okay I want you to hear what your enemy
[1:51:00] is saying if you hear what your enemy
[1:51:03] says about you you would have
[1:51:06] confidence the enemy thinks about us and
[1:51:09] he and he has conversations about us he
[1:51:11] has nightmares about us and a son of God
[1:51:15] who knows who they are is Hell's worst
[1:51:20] nightmare you remember in Portland OR
[1:51:22] brother brandom he was preaching and
[1:51:24] that huge demon-possessed man came
[1:51:26] running up to him and he was spitting
[1:51:28] and cussing and threatening to break
[1:51:30] brother Brandon's bones and it's because
[1:51:33] the devil knows who God's people
[1:51:36] are because you have challenged the
[1:51:38] servant of God in jesus' name ye shall
[1:51:41] fall at my feet and that's where he
[1:51:44] stayed the devil knows who you are but
[1:51:46] he's helpless a bluff he's trying to
[1:51:49] scare you he's a toothless
[1:51:53] liing he's a liar he's our enemy he's
[1:51:57] defeated
[1:51:58] today now Gideon over hears the enemy
[1:52:02] having this dream about him having
[1:52:04] nightmares about him and Gideon realizes
[1:52:07] that he underestimates the threat that
[1:52:11] he
[1:52:12] is he underestimates how the enemy sees
[1:52:16] him and God's people underestimate who
[1:52:19] we
[1:52:20] are we underestimate the threat that we
[1:52:23] are as the bride of
[1:52:25] Christ it's one thing to be encouraged
[1:52:28] When God says you're a mighty man of
[1:52:31] Valor and it's one thing to be
[1:52:34] encouraged by your brothers the 300 that
[1:52:37] stood by your side against this massive
[1:52:40] enemy that greatly outnumbered you
[1:52:42] that's another thing to have them
[1:52:44] encourage you but to know the enemy
[1:52:46] really thinks about you to realize the
[1:52:50] boasts of the enemy all all along were a
[1:52:54] bluff Gideon discovered that all of hell
[1:52:58] was having nightmares about him the
[1:53:01] enemy is having nightmares that you'll
[1:53:04] realize who you
[1:53:06] are God told Gideon you have no idea how
[1:53:10] powerful you are what's his
[1:53:13] response but I'm the least of my
[1:53:15] father's house and my father's house is
[1:53:18] the least of Israel there's no way I
[1:53:22] what you're asking me to
[1:53:24] do why don't you just go down and listen
[1:53:27] to what your enemy has to say about you
[1:53:30] so let's recognize there's God's view
[1:53:34] there's Earth's View and there's the
[1:53:37] enemy's view
[1:53:39] amen Heaven's view is Gideon you're a
[1:53:42] mighty man of
[1:53:45] Valor Earth's view I'm the least in my
[1:53:48] father's house the enemy's view that
[1:53:52] loaf of of bread is a sword coming to
[1:53:54] kill us we're shaking in our boots we're
[1:53:56] trembling we're
[1:53:58] tered now all throughout scripture you
[1:54:01] see the differences in these views
[1:54:04] there's a little child laid in a manger
[1:54:07] and God's view is that's the seed and
[1:54:09] his heel will crush the enemy's head he
[1:54:12] will end up taking back the keys of
[1:54:15] death and the keys of hell and the keys
[1:54:17] of the
[1:54:18] Grave
[1:54:20] Earth's don't even give him a room at
[1:54:22] the in put him in a barn most miss it
[1:54:26] right in front of them in the enemy's
[1:54:29] view Herod says kill all the mill
[1:54:32] children under the age of three they say
[1:54:34] the Messiah is here my kingdom is about
[1:54:37] to
[1:54:38] end that's why we come and we hear the
[1:54:41] message
[1:54:42] of we need bread we need sustenance
[1:54:46] bread speaks of the word of God Amen
[1:54:50] hell sees it as an army being trained
[1:54:54] hell knows that principalities and
[1:54:56] powers and rulers of Darkness are being
[1:54:59] disarmed as the word Goes Forth today
[1:55:02] hell sees Goliath's head being chopped
[1:55:05] off hell sees job realizing that his
[1:55:09] Redeemer
[1:55:11] liveth says that the enemy was like
[1:55:14] Locust that the camels outnumbered the
[1:55:17] sands on the seashore why would we need
[1:55:20] to
[1:55:20] know 200 and 50,000 troops stood against
[1:55:24] this man and why on Earth would they
[1:55:27] feel that they needed
[1:55:29] 250,000 troops and that kind of Weaponry
[1:55:33] for 300
[1:55:36] men it's because they know that God said
[1:55:40] he was
[1:55:42] mighty and the enemy knows that if God
[1:55:45] calls you mighty it has everything to
[1:55:48] fear no matter what the odds are let's
[1:55:52] listen to the enemy for a moment you
[1:55:55] consider if you will with me the size of
[1:55:58] the
[1:56:00] attack what's the level of attack that's
[1:56:03] been launched against your life 250,000
[1:56:07] demons let me ask you a question why the
[1:56:12] sickness why the
[1:56:15] rejection why the
[1:56:18] abandonment why the
[1:56:20] abuse why the Heartbreak
[1:56:22] why the loneliness the discouragement
[1:56:25] the
[1:56:26] depression why the feeling of be being
[1:56:29] eaten up with
[1:56:30] worry why the sense of feeling like you
[1:56:33] don't measure up like you're just a
[1:56:35] failure why the constant attacks from
[1:56:38] the
[1:56:39] enemy every time you try to rise the
[1:56:41] enemy is there to hit you in some way
[1:56:43] shape or form all of hell is attacking
[1:56:46] this bride of Jesus Christ and all of
[1:56:49] hell is against this
[1:56:51] message that let you know how the enemy
[1:56:53] sees you he's not launching that kind of
[1:56:56] attack against somebody that's not a
[1:56:58] threat but because he knows that God has
[1:57:01] said you're mighty he knows that God has
[1:57:05] said he's with you and he's going to do
[1:57:07] great things through you and he's going
[1:57:09] to do great things you that he's going
[1:57:11] to deliver you the devil attacks you at
[1:57:14] an equal level of the calling on your
[1:57:17] life and that bread of life is is is a
[1:57:21] life flow to us but it's a death blow to
[1:57:24] the enemy right now now if you want to
[1:57:27] know the enemy's real condition this
[1:57:30] morning read Colossians
[1:57:33] 2:15 the Bible says that he was disarmed
[1:57:38] it says here there was a public
[1:57:41] speculation or spectacle made of him and
[1:57:44] he was put to
[1:57:47] open that that's powerful to think of to
[1:57:50] realize not only did Jesus go and disarm
[1:57:53] him of the keys of death and hell and
[1:57:56] the grave and stripped him down but
[1:57:59] according to the Ancient Warfare that
[1:58:01] Paul was referring to there Colossians
[1:58:05] when one Army overtook another they
[1:58:07] would strip the king down of his Royal
[1:58:10] garments they would take his throne and
[1:58:12] they would take his weaponry and they
[1:58:14] would chain him to the other soldiers
[1:58:16] they wouldn't leave him in the battle
[1:58:19] case scenario he would live and they
[1:58:21] would take him to the city square of the
[1:58:23] Conquering Kingdom of their own kingdom
[1:58:25] and the people would Gather in a great
[1:58:28] celebration and like a parade they would
[1:58:31] March the enemy around stripped down to
[1:58:33] nothing they'd March around not only
[1:58:37] disarmed but now making a public
[1:58:40] demonstration a public spectacle of the
[1:58:42] defeat putting the king to open shame
[1:58:46] letting the people know that now the
[1:58:49] threat is
[1:58:50] gone that the threat is over it's
[1:58:54] defeated the Bible says that one day
[1:58:56] we'll look back on Satan who cost us all
[1:59:00] this pain and we'll say one we'll say
[1:59:03] that's the one that we allowed to so
[1:59:06] much pain and so much heartache in our
[1:59:10] life I'll tell you what a public
[1:59:12] spectacle is
[1:59:14] today a public spectacle is when that
[1:59:18] woman has received a terrible diagnosis
[1:59:21] and throws her arms up in defiance of
[1:59:24] the devil and praises the Lord a public
[1:59:27] spectacle is when that young lady s
[1:59:30] oppression but overcomes with praises to
[1:59:33] her king that's a public spectacle when
[1:59:37] the Lord will pull someone from the pits
[1:59:39] of Hell from
[1:59:41] drugs from
[1:59:43] sex horrible pornography whatever he's
[1:59:46] pulled you from the
[1:59:48] gutters and you're here today that is in
[1:59:52] Defiance that is a public
[1:59:57] spectacle praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:00:03] hallelujah hallelujah so Gideon heard
[2:00:06] what the enemy was saying before he was
[2:00:10] afraid now he gets up and says it's time
[2:00:14] they grab their lamps and Gideon's
[2:00:16] instructions were to break the covering
[2:00:18] on the lamp so the lamp could shine and
[2:00:21] then to shout
[2:00:22] amen So the instructions were whatever
[2:00:25] has to be broken let it be broken off so
[2:00:28] you can shine and you can shout amen
[2:00:32] that's how the victory is won you shine
[2:00:34] and you shout the sword of the Lord and
[2:00:37] the sword of Gideon so the enemy ran and
[2:00:41] fled because gide Gideon began to have a
[2:00:43] revelation of of God's sword this is the
[2:00:46] sword of the Lord and the sword of
[2:00:49] Gideon who was having the
[2:00:52] dream the enemy who was giving the
[2:00:58] interpretation the
[2:01:00] enemy why do you think our Prophet said
[2:01:03] look at all the signs around you it's
[2:01:05] the enemy telling you that the bride has
[2:01:08] won the
[2:01:08] [Applause]
[2:01:09] fight amen I want you to know the enemy
[2:01:13] is not here to win this battle he knows
[2:01:17] his time that's why he went to Jesus and
[2:01:20] he said have you come to to torment us
[2:01:22] before our time he knows his time the
[2:01:26] enemy knows he can't hold your children
[2:01:29] the enemy knows he can't keep you down
[2:01:32] the enemy knows you have prayed and the
[2:01:35] Lord has heard your prayer and it's over
[2:01:38] for your enemy this is the devil's
[2:01:42] Nightmare and I wonder how many
[2:01:44] nightmares is he having tonight not just
[2:01:47] a loaf of but a mighty Army a bride
[2:01:50] Marching In step
[2:01:52] the devil's backing up because he sees
[2:01:54] the same look in your eyes that he saw
[2:01:57] in the one that said I am alive forever
[2:02:00] more Jesus said fear not I have the keys
[2:02:04] of hell and death Jesus handed you those
[2:02:09] same
[2:02:11] keys if we could stand to our
[2:02:17] feet thank you Lord Jesus can we all
[2:02:21] shout some something
[2:02:23] yeah the sword of the Lord and of
[2:02:28] Gideon I'm sure we can all find
[2:02:30] something to praise the Lord about we
[2:02:33] all have something that we can put
[2:02:35] Praise on our lips something deep in our
[2:02:37] heart that we reach out and praise him
[2:02:39] for we just read the enemy's defeated
[2:02:43] the enemy's defeated today sometimes
[2:02:46] things look dark sometimes things look
[2:02:48] glim but no that fear is of the put fear
[2:02:53] back where it belongs put it in the
[2:02:56] devil's Camp he's there bluffing you
[2:02:59] getting you to think that you are the
[2:03:01] one that's fearful realistically it's
[2:03:03] him who's fearful of you rising up rise
[2:03:07] up today as an army rise up today as the
[2:03:10] bride of Christ and say the sword of the
[2:03:14] Lord and of
[2:03:15] Gideon
[2:03:19] amen amen
[2:03:22] I've got one more little story I'd like
[2:03:24] to tell it's uh if you're history buff
[2:03:27] you you may have read this Napoleon
[2:03:30] bonapart uh it's it's interesting this
[2:03:33] this man was a vicious vicious conqueror
[2:03:38] he pillaged the
[2:03:40] world but one day he was
[2:03:43] defeated and they actually exiled him
[2:03:46] they sent him to Exile they didn't want
[2:03:48] him to be a martyr and while in Exile
[2:03:51] was standing there with his generals and
[2:03:55] he was he laid his map out of all
[2:03:58] victories and he was boastfully going
[2:04:00] over all of his battles that he this
[2:04:02] area he pillaged in this area he
[2:04:05] overthrew them in this area he looted a
[2:04:07] lot of gold this area man he struck fear
[2:04:10] into their hearts this area he burn down
[2:04:12] in this area but then the general
[2:04:14] interrupted him and he said what about
