[17:33] Morning, brothers and
[17:36] sisters. It is sure is good to be in the
[17:38] house of the Lord this morning. If we'll
[17:40] just all stand this morning. How many
[17:43] has the Lord been good to this
[17:45] week? He's been good to all of us. Uh if
[17:49] we'll just bow our heads, maybe Brother
[17:51] Joe will open us in prayer this morning.
[17:54] [Music]
[18:25] realiz years ago.
[18:27] never seen her before. She got
[18:52] real. The Lord provide me
[18:56] We all know the
[19:13] stores have mercy.
[19:15] Jesus,
[19:19] we
[19:22] service
[19:25] Jesus Lord that you give us this
[19:38] area. I thank you Lord Jesus that you
[19:40] chose me the found.
[19:58] Amen. The children can be dismissed for
[20:00] Sunday school. If we'll go in the
[20:02] Psalms, we're going to go to Psalms 37.
[20:05] We had read the first part of that
[20:06] Psalms, but we didn't read the very end
[20:10] of it here. So, we're going to start in
[20:11] verse 23 today. Psalms 37, starting in
[20:15] verse 23, and we're going to read the
[20:17] rest of
[20:22] it. The steps of a good man are ordered
[20:25] by the Lord, and he delightth in his
[20:27] way.
[20:34] I have been young, now I'm old, yet I
[20:36] have not seen the righteous forsaken,
[20:38] nor a seed begging bread.
[20:45] Depart from evil and do good and
[20:47] dwelleth forever more.
[20:58] The righteous shall inherit the land and
[21:00] dwell therein forever.
[21:08] The law of his God is in his heart. None
[21:11] of the his steps shall slide.
[21:18] The Lord will not leave him in his hand,
[21:21] nor condemn him when he is judged.
[21:33] I have seen the wicked in great power
[21:36] and spreading himself like a green bay
[21:38] tree.
[21:46] Mark the perfect man and behold the
[21:48] upright for the end of that man is
[21:50] peace.
[21:58] The salvation of the righteous is of the
[22:00] Lord. He is their strength in a time of
[22:03] trouble. And the Lord shall help them
[22:05] and deliver them. and he shall deliver
[22:08] them from the wicked and save them
[22:10] because they trust in him. God bless
[22:12] you. May be seated, brother
[22:20] Ryan. So good. He is their strength in a
[22:22] time of trouble. That's exactly
[22:26] right. Morning, brothers and
[22:28] sisters. So, after the last couple of
[22:31] weeks, I sure hope no one's living below
[22:33] their privileges this morning. Uh if you
[22:36] would turn with me, um I'm trying to
[22:38] decide where to go this morning. Uh you
[22:41] know those things that were up on the
[22:44] wall up there
[22:47] uh that you know that before church
[22:49] began. If you turn with me to Galatians
[22:51] the 5th
[22:53] chapter, you know, I was thinking about
[22:56] the potter and the clay this morning as
[22:58] I was reading those things that were up
[23:00] there. If I find my place
[23:05] here, you know, it's really
[23:07] true. When when the potter is beating
[23:10] the clay, do you ever hear the clay
[23:12] scream out, why are you doing that?
[23:37] I think that that should be
[23:40] better. You know, a board, if you cut a
[23:42] board, do you ever hear it scream,
[23:44] "Why'd you cut me that way?" Okay. A
[23:46] fabricator when you cut steel rolled or
[23:49] straight or square, do you ever hear it
[23:51] scream back to you, why did you cut me
[23:53] that way? No, it doesn't. It just
[23:55] accepts what the master is doing to it
[23:57] to make it in that image that the master
[24:00] has for it at the end. And that's the
[24:02] way Christ is with us this morning. He's
[24:05] working in our hearts, working in our
[24:07] lives, trying to fabricate us, bring us
[24:10] into an image that he has for each one
[24:12] of us this morning. And that image, the
[24:15] image that he has for me, Brian Baldwin,
[24:17] might not be the image that he has for
[24:20] you, but the one thing that's consistent
[24:22] in all those things that God is making
[24:25] that Christ is the center of it all. And
[24:28] and I was also thinking, you know, the
[24:30] word of God is that
[24:32] filter for the hour we need this
[24:35] morning. Because if you take yourself
[24:37] and you let yourself be filtered through
[24:39] the word of God, what comes out on the
[24:42] other end will be 100% pure. You know,
[24:45] in the natural sense, there's no filter
[24:47] that will give you 100%. But I can
[24:50] guarantee you in God's word, if you'll
[24:52] allow yourself, your life, everything
[24:55] about you to fall through the word of
[24:58] God, when you come out on the other
[25:00] side, you'll be perfect the way that God
[25:02] expects you to be perfect. not of your
[25:04] own self but of what the word of God has
[25:07] done for you in the in the life that we
[25:10] live. And I was um let me hope I don't
[25:13] get ahead of myself. I was listening to
[25:16] a few
[25:17] messages yesterday and this morning I
[25:20] was listening to that message doors
[25:22] indoors in u 1965. I think it's February
[25:27] 9th or 3rd. I I don't have the date. And
[25:30] uh brother Brown was talking about
[25:32] numerous things, but uh the one thing
[25:35] that he was talking about that really
[25:37] struck my heart, I made some notes. I
[25:40] don't even know if I'll read a scripture
[25:41] this
[25:43] morning, but I was thinking of what's
[25:45] been said the last couple of weeks that
[25:48] um and I've got the wrong one here.
[25:50] These are not the notes I had this
[25:53] morning. You know, you have to learn to
[25:55] relax, not to get in a hurry and let God
[25:58] have his way this morning. I'll find
[26:00] it. And if I don't find it, I have
[26:02] enough memory that I can go with what I
[26:04] have in my memory. And I don't have it
[26:07] this morning. It's probably here, but I
[26:10] don't remember what I did with
[26:13] it. But I was just thinking this morning
[26:17] that I'll just let me go to this chapter
[26:20] here. If I don't, I'll lose my train of
[26:23] thought. I'll find it
[26:26] here. No, I won't find it.
[26:29] Okay. See, even after 65 years, even I
[26:33] can make mistakes.
[26:35] But I was reading that script, that's
[26:38] the scripture for the devotional this
[26:39] morning. I'll just read that scripture
[26:41] and I'll get my I'll get back on track
[26:43] here this morning. You know, everything
[26:46] has a purpose.
[26:49] Um, this is the wrong one, but he was he
[26:53] was talking in the scriptures
[26:57] about
[26:58] boy, I'm getting all choked up here. I
[27:01] was just I'll just read what I was
[27:03] coming to my mind. Like I was saying
[27:05] earlier that if you let the word of God
[27:07] take its effect in your life, it'll
[27:10] bring about a change that'll make you in
[27:12] the image of Jesus Christ this morning.
[27:15] But it'll let you see your that's the
[27:18] most important thing to have the right
[27:20] foundation where you receive salvation
[27:23] through the grace of Jesus Christ and
[27:25] you get sanctified and then you get the
[27:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it's
[27:29] through that humility that comes from
[27:31] that experience that God can show you in
[27:34] the life the things that he's removing
[27:36] from you, the things that you don't need
[27:38] to be holding on anymore in your life.
[27:41] And uh I I you probably know I've been
[27:45] doing this for I think almost 30 years
[27:48] now. And I always wind up going to the
[27:52] Galatians the 5th chapter because that's
[27:55] what God's trying to make this morning.
[27:57] He's trying to make you like you go back
[28:00] to second Peter the first and second
[28:02] chapter. He's trying to make an image
[28:04] out of you this morning where where you
[28:06] have no imperfections left in you and
[28:09] the only thing that's in you is what
[28:11] God's going to redeem on that day. And
[28:13] these are the things that he wants in
[28:15] us. And they're they're the fruit of the
[28:17] spirit. But only by having the correct
[28:20] relationship with Jesus Christ can you
[28:22] see the things that God wants to remove
[28:25] from you. And uh let me I don't want to
[28:28] read the bad things, but let's start at
[28:31] about the 22nd verse of the fifth
[28:34] chapter. But of the fruit of the spirit
[28:36] is love, joy, peace, and longsuffering.
[28:40] And I was, you know, just I was thinking
[28:42] this morning that if you allow the word
[28:45] of God to have its effect, that's the
[28:48] only thing that I want in my life.
[28:49] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[28:51] faith, meekness, temperaments, against
[28:54] there's no law. And they that are of
[28:57] Christ have crucified the flesh with the
[28:59] affections and lust. If we live in the
[29:03] spirit, let us also walk in the spirit.
[29:05] Let us not be desirous of vain glory
[29:08] provoking one another. And I was um
[29:12] those thoughts are coming back to me
[29:13] now. And I was listening to that message
[29:16] and it's really important. You have the
[29:19] only way you can manufacture these
[29:21] things. It's got to be your nature this
[29:23] morning. You have to have a Christian
[29:26] nature in you this morning. And you'll
[29:28] manufacture these attributes that you
[29:31] need to have. And Brother Brandham was
[29:33] talking about how sheep are sheep. They
[29:36] bear wool, you know, and they can't help
[29:39] it. That's exactly what they're going to
[29:41] bear. They're going to bear wool. That's
[29:43] who they are. And that's the same thing
[29:44] about Christians. If if you're a real
[29:47] Christian, you'll be bear the attributes
[29:50] of Jesus Christ this morning. It won't
[29:52] be manufactured. It won't be this. It
[29:55] won't be that. It'll be the true
[29:56] representation of Jesus Christ. And um
[30:00] uh you have to forgive me. I lost some
[30:02] of those notes. They're in this Bible,
[30:03] but I'll I'll make a mess this morning.
[30:07] But I was thinking from the meetings
[30:09] last week. I don't have a lot to say
[30:11] this morning. I know I say that a lot,
[30:14] but sometimes we put God so far out
[30:17] there, but really God is right here. The
[30:20] distance between you and Jesus Christ
[30:23] this morning is right here in your heart
[30:25] this morning. That's the door. That's
[30:27] the That's the distance. It's not up
[30:30] there. It's not out there in the
[30:31] atmosphere somewhere, but it's right
[30:33] here in your heart this morning. And
[30:35] that's where Christ needs to be.
[30:37] Sometimes we're expecting God to do
[30:39] these great things and really he's just
[30:42] right in here trying to change your
[30:44] heart and life to make you in his image
[30:47] this morning. You know uh you know
[30:52] uh you know I I know in my own life if
[30:55] someone asked me to do a great thing
[30:57] that's what I would want to do. I think
[30:58] that's what God would want me to do
[31:00] because that's that's something that can
[31:03] be measured. I can see what God wants me
[31:06] to do. But a lot of times it isn't that
[31:08] way with God. God wants a simple thing
[31:11] done. He wants you to just to be simple
[31:13] Christians this morning. Well, you're
[31:15] simply living lives in Jesus Christ this
[31:19] morning. I had a lot to say this morning
[31:21] and all of a sudden I'm going blank
[31:23] here. And one thing I've learned in life
[31:26] is you can only go as far as God is
[31:28] leading you. You can't for force God to
[31:31] do something in your life that he's not
[31:34] walking with you to do. And a lot of
[31:36] times we like running ahead of God,
[31:38] getting ahead of him. And then we wind
[31:40] up when we get ahead of him, we're not
[31:42] where we're supposed to be this morning.
[31:44] But we want to walk in in we want to
[31:47] walk in step with what his will for us
[31:50] is this morning. And there was one thing
[31:54] I was thinking, I know it'll come. God
[31:56] will speak to me this morning. The most
[31:58] important thing I can think
[32:02] of is when God changes your heart and
[32:05] life, I I know how to make it so simple.
[32:08] You know, after 65
[32:10] years, there can be no when God makes a
[32:13] change in your life, makes a change in
[32:15] you. When you walk in faith in Jesus
[32:18] Christ, everything that you did in the
[32:20] past, you everyone knows you put it in
[32:22] that lake of God's forgetfulness, in the
[32:24] sea of God's forgetfulness. When you put
[32:27] it there, there's no fishing. And I I
[32:29] can tell you this morning, whether
[32:31] you're a young Christian, an old
[32:33] Christian, wherever you're walk, a
[32:35] medium Christian in the walk, your enemy
[32:38] is going to want to make you go back
[32:40] fishing in your whatever you did in your
[32:42] past this morning. And you got to put up
[32:44] that sign. That sign is for you, too.
[32:47] It's not just for your neighbor. It's
[32:49] not for your brother and sister also,
[32:51] but it's for you. No fishing. You don't
[32:53] go back in the the past things of your
[32:55] life that you've gotten over. You leave
[32:57] that alone and you keep walking further.
[33:00] And I it took me a long I know I can
[33:02] only speak for myself. It took me a long
[33:05] time to realize when you make mistakes
[33:07] or I've made mistakes. Once I know that
[33:09] God has forgiven me for them, I have to
[33:12] put up that sign. I have to put it in
[33:14] that box and give God the key and leave
[33:16] it there. And a lot of times if you find
[33:18] those old thoughts coming back, you just
[33:21] got to say, "Devil, it's I'm going to
[33:23] leave it in the box. I'm not going to
[33:25] think about it anymore. Not going to
[33:27] dwell on it anymore. I've left it. It's
[33:30] going to stay there." But you'll find
[33:32] out when your enemy, if you're not
[33:34] careful, he'll start bringing up them
[33:36] bad thoughts in your life. The things
[33:38] you might have done in the past, things
[33:40] you should have done and you didn't do,
[33:42] all the things that can confuse your
[33:44] mind. And you got to say to yourself,
[33:46] "No, I'm not going to go back there
[33:48] anymore. I'm going to take a step
[33:50] forward in Jesus Christ and I'm gonna
[33:52] leave that behind." I know I was
[33:55] thinking of also I'll finish with this
[33:57] one thought when brother David comes
[33:59] out. Just like I was thinking from the
[34:01] meetings, you know, all the brothers
[34:03] that were preaching, you know, you could
[34:05] break it down to something simple.
[34:06] Brother Brandham said, you you know, you
[34:09] get when you're at the train station,
[34:11] you all know where I'm going. When
[34:13] you're waiting for the train or you're
[34:15] waiting for the airplane or whatever it
[34:16] is you're waiting for. When it's time to
[34:19] go, it's time to go. Whatever you're
[34:21] doing, you just got to let your peanuts
[34:23] fall. Whatever it is, you just leave it
[34:25] there and you get on the train or get on
[34:27] the plane. You don't want to be playing
[34:29] with the little things that miss the
[34:30] train or miss the plane. You want to be
[34:32] there on that day. Brother David,
[34:41] how many is glad to be in the house of
[34:42] the Lord this morning?
[34:44] Amen. I I just looking for a great
[34:48] anticipation of what the Lord has for us
[34:50] this morning. And Amen.
[34:53] And I was thinking of that Psalms that
[34:56] Brother Troy read and said, "I have been
[34:59] young and now I'm old. Yet I have not
[35:01] seen their righteousness forsaken, nor
[35:04] seed begging bread. He is ever
[35:07] merciful and
[35:09] lenth and his seed is blessed. That's us
[35:14] this morning. Amen. Let's stand this
[35:16] morning if we could and sing that song,
[35:19] the goodness of God this morning. And
[35:21] Amen. You love him with all your heart
[35:23] this morning. Amen. And I'm thankful for
[35:26] the goodness of God in my heart and
[35:28] life. I love you,
[35:33] Lord, for your mercy never fails
[35:38] me. And all my
[35:41] days I've been held in your
[35:46] hand. The moment that I wake
[35:50] up until I lay my
[35:54] head. Oh, I will
[35:57] sing of the
[35:59] goodness of
[36:01] [Music]
[36:04] God. Cuz all my life you have been
[36:12] faithful. All my life you have been so
[36:17] so
[36:20] good. With every breath that I am
[36:26] able, I will
[36:29] sing of the
[36:31] goodness of
[36:34] God. I love your
[36:39] voice. You have led me through the
[36:43] fire, through the darkest night.
[36:47] You are close like no
[36:52] other. I've known you as a
[36:56] father. I've known you as a
[37:00] friend. And I have lived in the
[37:05] goodness of
[37:09] God. And all my life you have been
[37:18] faithful. All my life you have been so
[37:22] so
[37:25] good. With every breath that I am
[37:31] able. And I will
[37:34] sing of the goodness of God. All my life
[37:38] you've been faithful.
[37:42] And all my life you have been
[37:48] faithful. And all my life you have been
[37:52] so so
[37:56] good. With every breath that I am
[38:02] able, I will
[38:05] sing of the goodness of
[38:10] God. Oh, I will
[38:13] sing of the
[38:15] goodness of
[38:17] God. Amen. Don't you love him this
[38:20] morning? Amen. You may be seated this
[38:22] morning. God bless you. It's good to
[38:25] have each and everyone here this
[38:26] morning. And amen. Just looking forward
[38:30] to what the Lord has for us this
[38:31] morning. And I I love that song. And I
[38:35] guess Sister Emma was one of the first
[38:37] people I ever heard sing it other than
[38:38] the people I heard us sing on radio. And
[38:41] it just speaks volumes to my heart of
[38:44] how good he's been to me. Amen. And you
[38:48] know, we wouldn't be anywhere if it
[38:50] wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ
[38:52] this morning. There is power, wonder
[38:54] working power in the blood. Amen. Aren't
[38:57] you thankful for that power? Well, would
[39:00] you be free from your burden of sin? Oh,
[39:06] there's power in the blood. Oh, there's
[39:09] power in the
[39:11] blood. And would you
[39:15] or a victory win? Well, there's

[43:08] says, "Many have started to walk in the
[43:11] light and they've bade the world and
[43:13] I've ba the world in it follows a due
[43:15] and I've started in Jesus and I'm going

[44:14] through and oh there are many who start
[44:20] in the
[44:21] race but with the
[44:24] light refuse to keep pace and others
[44:30] accept it because it is new.
[44:35] But not very
[44:38] many expect to go through. Well, I'm
[44:43] going through. Yes, I'm going
[44:47] through and I'll pay the
[44:51] price. Whatever others do and I'll take
[44:57] the way with the Lord's despised view.
[45:01] Well, I've started with Jesus and I'm
[45:06] going through and I' rather walk with
[45:12] Jesus
[45:14] alone and have for a pillow like Jacob a
[45:21] stone and living each moment with his
[45:26] face in view. and shrink from my pathway

[46:00] going through and oh brother, now will
[46:05] you take up the
[46:08] cross? Give up the world and count it as

[47:00] through. And I'll pay the
[47:03] price. Whatever others do, and I'll take

[47:14] Well, I've started with Jesus and I'm

[47:21] through. Amen. Amen. God bless you this
[47:25] morning. Like I said, it's good to have
[47:27] each and everyone here. And man, we've
[47:29] got some I won't call all of them
[47:31] visitors cuz I don't consider John
[47:33] Michael a visitor and Sister Hope a
[47:35] visitor. It's good to have him back
[47:37] home. And today's a national holiday.
[47:39] How many knew
[47:40] that? Today's John Michael's birthday.
[47:44] And how old are you, John
[47:47] Michael? 23. Man, you're just a kid
[47:50] still. I'm 40 years older than you.
[47:54] Wow. Happy birthday, brother John
[47:56] Michael. And and we got an old-timer up

[48:23] looking guy. God bless you, brother Bo.
[48:25] It's good to have you here with us this
[48:27] morning. And and I looked at him and I
[48:29] asked her, I said, "Is he going to sing
[48:31] this morning?" He had a little tie on.
[48:32] He's a sharp little guy. And we don't
[48:35] you just appreciate the Lord giving us
[48:36] such wonderful gifts? And and I look at
[48:39] brother John and his head's about 4 foot
[48:41] wide and he's smiling from ear to ear
[48:43] because his grandbabies are here. And
[48:46] that's awesome. Let me tell you, if

[49:17] we want to remember them in prayer this
[49:19] morning. They're always very diligent in
[49:22] being here and have a heart's desire to
[49:24] be here. Also, Sister Parish desires our
[49:28] prayer and she said her feet and her
[49:29] legs
[49:31] uh are so tight from fluid buildup.
[49:35] Also, her stomach has fluid on it. She
[49:37] goes for a regular checkup to the doctor
[49:40] Tuesday to check out and see what's
[49:42] going on in her blood work. Continue to
[49:44] remember Sister Parish and pray that the

[49:48] for her. And want to continue to
[49:50] remember Sister Donna and Sister Janette

[49:55] sickness that the enemy's tried to place
[49:57] upon them. And brother Glenn text me

[50:05] home uh streaming this morning and
[50:08] brother Brad and and Sister Joyce and
[50:11] them and and brother Weston there in

[53:39] Brad and uh brother Daniel Andes and the
[53:42] brothers back home.
[53:44] And amen. this song here. You can feel
[53:47] free to sing it with me. I was I had a
[53:50] feeling I'd be called up by Brother
[53:52] David. I didn't put anything in to sing,
[53:54] but so I had a feeling and I went
[53:56] through the song book and I I looked at
[53:58] a couple songs here. So maybe we'll sing
[54:00] one or
[54:01] two. We'll start with the
[54:04] chorus. Oh, greater is he that is in
[54:10] me. Greater is he that is in me.
[54:15] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[54:20] is in the
[54:23] world. Oh, greater is he that is in
[54:28] me. Greater is he that is in
[54:32] me than he that is in the world.
[54:38] Well, Satan's like a roaring lion,
[54:43] seeking whom he may
[54:46] [Music]
[54:55] devour. Well, many souls have been his
[55:00] prey to fall in some weak hour.
[55:05] But God has promised us today his
[55:11] overcoming power. Sing it with me. Well,
[55:14] greater is he that is in
[55:18] me. Oh, greater is he that is in
[55:23] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[55:28] that is in the world.
[55:32] On the day of Pentecost, a rushing
[55:38] mighty wind blew into the upper room and
[55:45] baptized all of
[55:47] them with a power greater than any
[55:54] [Music]
[55:56] foe. And I'm so glad I've got it, too.
[56:01] I'll let the whole world know. Oh,
[56:06] greater is he that is in
[56:09] me. Oh, greater is he that is in
[56:14] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[56:20] that is in the
[56:22] world. Oh, greater is he that is in me.
[56:28] Greater is he that is in
[56:32] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[56:37] that is in the
[56:40] world. Amen. Do you believe that this
[56:42] morning? It's good to confess it
[56:45] sometimes. Like the brother was saying,
[56:47] Satan, he comes and he beats you up, but
[56:49] it's good to confess, greater is he that
[56:51] is in
[56:52] me. Amen. Let's sing this song here.
[56:54] Number
[56:56] 155, key of
[56:59] C. Well, I'm tired and so
[57:04] weary, but I
[57:07] must go
[57:09] along until the Lord comes and
[57:14] calls calls me away.
[57:21] The
[57:22] morning is
[57:24] bright and the
[57:27] lamb is the
[57:29] light and the night is as
[57:34] fair as the
[57:38] day. Oh, there will be
[57:41] peace in the
[57:44] valley for
[57:46] me someday.
[57:49] There will be
[57:50] peace in the
[57:53] valley for me, oh Lord, I pray. And
[57:58] there'll be no
[58:00] sadness, no
[58:03] sorrows, no
[58:05] trouble. I see.
[58:11] There will be
[58:12] peace in the
[58:15] valley for
[58:19] me. Oh, and the baby
[58:22] gentle and the
[58:25] wolf it will be
[58:27] tame. And the lion shall lay
[58:32] down down by the
[58:35] lamb. Oh yes.
[58:38] And the
[58:39] beast of the wild, it will be
[58:44] led by a child. And I'll be changed from
[58:50] this creature that I
[58:54] am. Oh, there will be
[58:58] peace in the
[59:01] valley for
[59:03] me someday.
[59:06] And there will be
[59:08] peace in the
[59:10] valley for me. Oh Lord, I pray there'll
[59:16] be no more sadness, no
[59:20] sorrows, no trouble.
[59:23] I
[59:27] see there will be peace in the
[59:32] valley for
[59:35] me. Oh, and there will be
[59:39] peace in the
[59:41] valley for
[59:44] me someday.
[59:47] There will be
[59:48] peace in the valley for me. Oh Lord, I
[59:55] pray there'll be no more
[59:58] sadness, no
[1:00:00] sorrows, no trouble, I
[1:00:07] see. And there will be
[1:00:10] peace in the
[1:00:13] valley for me.
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:20] [Applause]
[1:00:32] Thank you, brother Andrew, for reminding
[1:00:34] me. I forgot to greet the people.
[1:00:38] the Johnny Hkins that's came and
[1:00:40] preached for us a time or two and I
[1:00:42] talked to him this week some and and he
[1:00:45] said to tell people God bless you and
[1:00:48] they're going to try to get up here in a
[1:00:50] couple of weeks. So anyways, he told me
[1:00:53] to just make sure I can greet you and
[1:00:55] greet you also, brother Thomas. God
[1:00:57] bless you. That's it.
[1:01:06] [Music]

[1:01:33] times must I prove how much I love you?
[1:01:41] How many
[1:01:44] ways must my love for you I show?
[1:01:52] How many
[1:01:55] times must I resue you from trouble for
[1:02:01] you to know just how much I love you.
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:13] Did I wake you up this
[1:02:17] morning? Were you clothed in your right
[1:02:22] mind? When you walked into a
[1:02:27] problem, then I stepped right in our
[1:02:32] time. When you got weak along life's
[1:02:38] journey, my angel carried you so you
[1:02:44] would know just how much I love you.
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:02:56] How many
[1:02:58] days must I be a fence all around you?
[1:03:06] How many
[1:03:09] nights must I wipe your
[1:03:13] tears away?
[1:03:17] How many
[1:03:19] storms must I bring you safely
[1:03:24] through? You do know just how much I
[1:03:31] love you.
[1:03:36] I wake you up this
[1:03:40] morning. Were you clothed in your right
[1:03:45] mind when you walked into a
[1:03:50] problem? Then my snail cried in our
[1:03:55] time. When you got weak along life's
[1:04:00] journey, my angel carried you so you
[1:04:06] would know just how much I love you.
[1:04:16] Did I put food on your
[1:04:20] table? Show up when the bills were
[1:04:25] due. When the pain was like in your
[1:04:30] body and I sent healing down to
[1:04:34] you. When you were lost in sin and
[1:04:40] sorrow, I died to set you free. So you
[1:04:46] would know just how much I love you.
[1:04:55] Did I put food on your
[1:04:59] table? Show up when the bills were due.
[1:05:05] When the pain was wrecking your
[1:05:09] body, then I sent healing bound to
[1:05:13] you. When you were lost in sin and
[1:05:19] sorrow, I died to set you free. So you

[1:06:17] stand this morning and Amen. Ask Brother
[1:06:19] Thomas to come and sing that little
[1:06:21] chorus. Yes, Jesus loves me. As brother
[1:06:24] Thomas comes, oh
[1:06:26] yes,
[1:06:28] Jesus loves
[1:06:31] me.
[1:06:33] Yes,
[1:06:34] Jesus loves
[1:06:37] me. Oh
[1:06:39] yes, Jesus loves me. God bless you,
[1:06:44] buddy. Bless you.
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:58] Amen. Brother Bo or Brother John
[1:07:00] Michael, you all want to greet the
[1:07:01] people? We'll give you the mic or
[1:07:03] something. No. All
[1:07:06] right. I guess John Michael's expecting
[1:07:09] uh maybe to make it home tonight or
[1:07:12] maybe tomorrow. Tuesday. Tuesday. All
[1:07:15] right. Well, you got him for a couple
[1:07:18] days. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. God
[1:07:21] is good. Ain't he? Amen. Good to see
[1:07:23] y'all. Hope it's so good to see you.
[1:07:25] Praise the
[1:07:26] Lord. Amen. And so, it's just quite a
[1:07:30] few out this morning. Amen. So, thank
[1:07:32] you, musicians. Sorry for keeping you
[1:07:34] all up
[1:07:35] here. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. How
[1:07:38] many's enjoying the winter weather all
[1:07:41] the way up into June? Amen. Certainly is
[1:07:43] nice and cool. We certainly do
[1:07:45] appreciate the nice cool weather. We
[1:07:47] know that that hot stuff's coming right
[1:07:49] around the corner. So, and also um we
[1:07:53] want to plan on the 14th having to uh
[1:07:58] get together at the farm, but you know,
[1:08:00] we're going to have to kind of play it
[1:08:01] by ear because if it does rain a couple
[1:08:03] days before or whatever real bad and it
[1:08:06] just gets a soggy mess, we'll keep
[1:08:08] postponing until the weather's good
[1:08:10] enough and the dry ground is dry enough
[1:08:12] to have it. Amen. But we'll shoot for
[1:08:15] the 14th of June. Amen. So, Amen. Praise
[1:08:19] the Lord. Well, Amen. He's good, isn't
[1:08:22] he? We want to just try to continue on
[1:08:25] our thought. Amen. With the help of the
[1:08:27] Lord. Amen. On God shall
[1:08:30] supply all of your needs. How many
[1:08:34] believe that? Amen. God does that. And
[1:08:37] so, we just begin to think about that.
[1:08:40] uh begin to meditate on that and and of
[1:08:44] course it took us uh into a lot of
[1:08:47] different areas that I plan on uh
[1:08:51] speaking on this morning. Amen. I think
[1:08:54] they had on our group text this morning.
[1:08:57] Something that I thought I might reach
[1:08:58] because as I begin to think about that
[1:09:01] simple scripture of my God shall supply
[1:09:03] all of your needs and the direction that
[1:09:06] he's already taken me and you know how
[1:09:08] it all ties together. But Abraham says,
[1:09:10] "Yes, I could take this one text," he
[1:09:12] said, "and with the Holy Spirit, preach
[1:09:14] on it a hundred
[1:09:16] years and never get what's in it out."
[1:09:20] Amen. Because in this one text, like all
[1:09:24] other texts of the Bible, is all tied
[1:09:26] together. Amen. And so this certainly
[1:09:29] is. Amen. Certainly is tied together.
[1:09:32] Amen. Of course, uh we already went and
[1:09:34] spoke a little bit on my talking about
[1:09:37] just that word need. Ain't that right?
[1:09:40] My God shall supply all your needs. How
[1:09:42] many knows we're have very needy people?
[1:09:45] We have a lot of needs. And as long as
[1:09:47] you're in this body, as long as you're
[1:09:49] here in the earth, you're going to have
[1:09:51] needs. Amen. But we have a God that
[1:09:54] supplies our needs. You know, I was
[1:09:57] sitting back there and I thought, you
[1:09:58] know, a good question to ask. Can you
[1:10:00] imagine if I told you what if I give you
[1:10:03] something? What if I give you uh I don't
[1:10:06] know, you know, this bottle here and
[1:10:11] anything that you ever wish for,
[1:10:13] anything that you'll ever really
[1:10:15] need, it'll give it to
[1:10:20] you. Now, it comes to who wants it?
[1:10:27] That's right. We'd have a lot of people
[1:10:29] rushing up here, right? There's only one
[1:10:31] and you'd be rushing up here to get it.
[1:10:33] Well, who wouldn't want that? How many
[1:10:36] knows? Well, that's Christ.
[1:10:38] Amen. Give the Lord a hand. That's
[1:10:40] Christ. He is all that you have ever
[1:10:43] need of. Anything that you'll ever need,
[1:10:46] he's it. Amen. And we're blessed people.
[1:10:50] Amen. Amen. And that's why we ought to
[1:10:52] be the happiest people on the face of
[1:10:54] the earth because we've got a promise
[1:10:56] that if we we're in Christ, Amen. when
[1:10:59] you have the Holy Ghost, Brother Bam
[1:11:00] says, everything that you have need of
[1:11:02] in this life's journey or in the world
[1:11:04] to come is in you, then you've got it.
[1:11:09] You've got what you need. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:12] The fulfiller of all of your needs. So,
[1:11:15] we want to go there with the help of the
[1:11:16] Lord. And also, Amen. I I I tied it in
[1:11:19] with the the question, you know, that
[1:11:22] our brothers made and brother Brandham
[1:11:24] makes a statement and I want to read it
[1:11:25] here um uh in a minute. Amen. About the
[1:11:28] devil's question. We have the answer to
[1:11:30] the devil's question. Amen. And so if
[1:11:32] there's a question, then there's a need
[1:11:36] for what? For an answer. Let me know. So
[1:11:38] if there's a question, there's a need
[1:11:39] for an answer. And we want to dwell on
[1:11:41] that a little bit this morning with the
[1:11:43] help of the Lord. We're going to go into
[1:11:44] the Leodysia age. Amen. And so forth.
[1:11:47] But anyway, let's just bow our heads and
[1:11:49] talk to the author before we amen start.
[1:11:52] Lord Jesus, we come before you this
[1:11:53] morning once again, Lord. We thank
[1:11:55] thankful to be assembled, Lord,
[1:11:57] together. And Lord, you knew exactly
[1:11:59] which one and how many and who would sit
[1:12:01] where this morning, Lord, we believe
[1:12:03] with all of our heart that you ordained
[1:12:05] this service before the foundation of
[1:12:07] the world. You knew exactly the text
[1:12:09] that I would take, exactly what you lay
[1:12:11] on my heart to speak, Father. And we
[1:12:13] just ask God that we'd be in your center
[1:12:15] of your will on everything that we would
[1:12:17] do and all that we would say. Father,
[1:12:19] bless those that couldn't be here, those
[1:12:20] that are not feeling well. We ask for
[1:12:22] healing, for a healing touch for them.
[1:12:24] Raise them right back up again, Lord
[1:12:25] Jesus, and come and bring them back into
[1:12:27] the place where they should be, Lord.
[1:12:29] And we ask, God, that you'll just take
[1:12:31] your word now. Anoint us to speak it and
[1:12:33] help us, Lord, to lay aside ourselves
[1:12:36] completely, Lord, so that you just use
[1:12:37] us to speak in Jesus name. We ask it.
[1:12:40] Everybody said, "Amen." Turn your Bibles
[1:12:42] if you will. We'll go to the first
[1:12:44] scripture that we started with. Amen.
[1:12:46] This will be my God shall supply all of
[1:12:48] your needs part two.
[1:12:51] Amen. Praise the Lord. I also title it
[1:12:54] the answer to Leosa. The answer to the
[1:12:58] leady God's question to the condition of
[1:13:01] the
[1:13:02] leis. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:06] Philippians
[1:13:09] 4 and
[1:13:12] verse
[1:13:13] 19. But my God shall supply all your
[1:13:17] need according to his riches in glory by
[1:13:21] Christ Jesus. Now, Revelations 4, we'll
[1:13:23] just pick this up. Revelations 3. I'm
[1:13:26] not not four. Revelations 3. A very
[1:13:29] familiar scripture. Amen. But once
[1:13:33] again, I find myself pulling some more
[1:13:35] out of it. Amen. So, this is one of
[1:13:37] those cases where you've read it and
[1:13:39] read it and preached on it and preached
[1:13:40] on it, but there's still more in there.
[1:13:43] Amen. There's still more in there.
[1:13:46] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. God is
[1:13:49] good, isn't
[1:13:50] he?
[1:13:54] Amen. Three and verse 14. And unto the
[1:13:58] angel of the church of the leadyans,
[1:14:00] write the thing, sayeth the amen, the
[1:14:02] faithful and true witness, the beginning
[1:14:04] of the creation of God. I know thy
[1:14:06] works, that thou art neither cold nor
[1:14:08] hot, I would thou cold nor or hot. So
[1:14:11] that because thou art lukewarm, and
[1:14:12] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[1:14:14] out of my mouth, because thou sayest, I
[1:14:17] am rich and increased with goods, and
[1:14:18] have need of nothing. Notice that word
[1:14:20] need. Amen. This is where I I felt led
[1:14:24] of the spirit to go because these people
[1:14:26] here had need. They thought they had
[1:14:28] need of nothing. Is that right? They
[1:14:31] didn't think they needed something.
[1:14:32] Amen. And so I made a comment on
[1:14:35] something on that that I want to try to
[1:14:37] just I I seen where brother Brandon
[1:14:38] makes this statement also and read it
[1:14:40] and I didn't know he made it. But when I
[1:14:42] made that statement, you know, I don't
[1:14:44] know, you might have thought it was a
[1:14:45] little different, a little weird,
[1:14:46] whatever. But whenever the prophet comes
[1:14:49] back and says kind of the same things,
[1:14:50] it's always uh good to know that you're
[1:14:53] on the right wavelength.
[1:14:55] Amen. that your mind is thinking the
[1:14:57] right thoughts. Amen. All right. So
[1:15:01] then, because thou art lukewarm and
[1:15:02] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[1:15:04] out of my mouth, because I sayest, I am
[1:15:06] rich and increase with goods, and have
[1:15:08] need of nothing, and knowest not that
[1:15:10] thou art wretched and miserable, poor,
[1:15:11] blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy
[1:15:13] of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
[1:15:15] mayest be rich, and wine raignment, that
[1:15:17] thou mayest be clothed, and that the
[1:15:19] shame of thy nakedness do not appear,
[1:15:21] and anoint thine eyes with thyself, that
[1:15:23] thou mayest see. As many as I love, I
[1:15:26] rebuke and chase and be zealous
[1:15:27] therefore and repent. Amen. I stand at
[1:15:30] door the door and knock. If any man hear
[1:15:32] my voice and open the door, I will come
[1:15:34] into him and will s with him and he with
[1:15:36] me. Amen. Is that too much
[1:15:40] rebound? Does that sound good? All
[1:15:43] right. Right there. That's why I like to
[1:15:45] keep it because I'll tell you what, I
[1:15:46] can hear. Amen. It sounds like it's all
[1:15:49] even to me. It's just just like that's
[1:15:51] that's good. So, praise the Lord. We can
[1:15:53] adjust those a little bit. And I've
[1:15:54] turned it over this way a little bit. M.
[1:15:57] So if I need to change it, I will. But I
[1:15:59] want to come and me as much as possible.
[1:16:01] Amen. God bless you. You can be
[1:16:06] seated. Amen. I missed something, didn't
[1:16:08] I? May God add his blessings to the
[1:16:10] reading of word. You can be seated.
[1:16:12] Amen. But Amen. We just have you seated
[1:16:15] this morning. Praise be to God. God is
[1:16:17] good. Amen.
[1:16:19] All
[1:16:21] right. Praise be to God. God is good,
[1:16:24] isn't he?
[1:16:26] Well, I don't think that we're
[1:16:28] definitely going to get through here,
[1:16:29] but we're just going to take our time.
[1:16:31] Amen. Try to go slow and take our time.
[1:16:34] Amen. Amen. With the help of the
[1:16:42] Lord. Amen. The answer to
[1:16:45] Leadsia. Now, we're living in an age.
[1:16:48] How many knows we're living in an age
[1:16:50] um in one sense we're living in the
[1:16:53] Leodysia church age in another in
[1:16:56] another sense we're far past it the
[1:16:58] world itself is in that leodysa church
[1:17:01] age is that right and now we want to
[1:17:03] look at the conditions first let's look
[1:17:04] at the conditions amen because what we
[1:17:07] want to do is overcome the conditions of
[1:17:10] leadya because how many know that's
[1:17:12] where you and I were before we come into
[1:17:15] the message before We had a call to come
[1:17:19] out. Amen. And so this is the most
[1:17:21] pathetic age of all ages because we know
[1:17:24] that Christ was outside of the church
[1:17:26] knocking trying to get back in. Amen.
[1:17:31] Amen. Praise the Lord. And I want to
[1:17:34] start
[1:17:35] with Well, let me me let me back up a
[1:17:38] little bit. Amen. Um, we know that for
[1:17:42] everything that the devil does, ain't
[1:17:45] that right? For everything that the
[1:17:46] devil does, God counters it.
[1:17:51] Amen. Scripture says in Isaiah, not
[1:17:54] Isaiah 59 and 9, it says
[1:17:58] um or 19 says, "So shall they fear the
[1:18:01] name of the Lord from the east and from
[1:18:04] the west and his glory from the rising
[1:18:07] of the sun. When the enemy shall come in
[1:18:10] like a flood, the spirit of the Lord
[1:18:13] shall raise up a standard against it.
[1:18:19] Amen. Praise the Lord. But Abraham says,
[1:18:22] "It was written one time that when you
[1:18:24] when you brought Israel out of the land
[1:18:26] of Egypt," he says they come right up
[1:18:28] against this mountain, the Red Sea had
[1:18:31] them
[1:18:32] bound. They could not go over. It's said
[1:18:35] by one of the writers that God looked
[1:18:37] down through the pillar of fire, looked
[1:18:40] at the Red
[1:18:42] Sea. Amen. And had his that had his
[1:18:45] people pinned off from the promised
[1:18:47] land. And he looked down with anger. And
[1:18:51] the Red Sea got scared.
[1:18:55] Amen. The Red Sea got scared and moved
[1:18:58] back and let Israel across over into the
[1:19:03] into the land. Amen. Amen. I had to
[1:19:06] think, you know, look at that here. The
[1:19:09] devil, Amen, had him pinned and listen.
[1:19:12] Then he goes on with the prayer. He
[1:19:14] says, "And father, Satan, like the Red
[1:19:17] Sea, has cornered off many of your
[1:19:20] people. They're laying bound. They're
[1:19:23] afflicted. They're sick." Amen. And when
[1:19:26] those handkerchiefs reach them, Amen.
[1:19:29] this token of God's grace. May the same
[1:19:32] God look through that same pillar of
[1:19:34] fire and may that sickness become
[1:19:37] scared.
[1:19:38] How many believe I was thinking you know
[1:19:41] uh you know we're always people are
[1:19:43] always you know the devil tries to scare
[1:19:45] the liver out of you whether it's by
[1:19:46] sickness or high blood pressure or
[1:19:48] whether it's diabetes or
[1:19:51] cancmen that you don't know how to get
[1:19:53] by. Amen. Now, how many knows that God
[1:19:56] actually uses the devil as a tool to
[1:19:59] bring us to where we're supposed to be?
[1:20:02] Sure he does. He uses the devil's
[1:20:04] nothing but a tool in the hands of of
[1:20:06] God.
[1:20:10] Just like the Red Sea, he used that as a
[1:20:12] tool. But he looked and made that sea
[1:20:15] parted. Now, we know that the Red Sea,
[1:20:17] that water ain't got no mind. But
[1:20:20] figuratively speaking, man, it just
[1:20:22] moved away and it dried up the ground
[1:20:24] and and let them through.
[1:20:27] What about the fire? Amen. That some
[1:20:29] three Hebrew children. No doubt. But
[1:20:31] that fire got scared when God got the
[1:20:33] looking down. No doubt. But that the
[1:20:35] lions got scared when they got the
[1:20:37] pillar of fire come down. Amen. And the
[1:20:39] king of the jungle all of a sudden got
[1:20:42] scared. Them lions are shaking.
[1:20:46] Amen. I like that. Don't you? When your
[1:20:47] enemy is
[1:20:49] scared, praise the Lord. Can I just say
[1:20:51] what comes to mind? I was thinking back
[1:20:53] there, you know, the devil comes and
[1:20:54] tries to scare you. Amen. You boo back.
[1:20:57] I said, "No, you're not the boogeyman.
[1:21:00] I'm your boogeyman.
[1:21:03] I'm the boogeyman here. You better get
[1:21:05] scared of me. I ain't scared of you. You
[1:21:08] better get scared. And you better run
[1:21:10] and you better hide."
[1:21:14] Ain't that right? Praise the Lord.
[1:21:16] better be scared of God because we have
[1:21:18] got Christ on our side. Light scatters
[1:21:21] the darkness. When you turn the switch
[1:21:22] on them roaches and them creatures of
[1:21:24] the darkness, they leave. How many knows
[1:21:27] when the when the Holy Spirit comes into
[1:21:29] your heart, those creatures of darkness
[1:21:31] of cancer and anxiety and everything
[1:21:33] else, it's got to go. Amen. Light drives
[1:21:36] it away. We scare him off. That's how
[1:21:40] it's supposed to be. That's God's answer
[1:21:44] to devil's question. God's always had
[1:21:46] the answer to the devil's question.
[1:21:49] Listen, and you know, brother Madden
[1:21:51] make that statement some statement so
[1:21:52] many times, you know, I haven't really
[1:21:55] understood it as much as I have in this
[1:21:57] last week as I begin to ponder on it
[1:21:59] because brother Bham, he picked that
[1:22:01] inspiration up. Amen. And I fig he
[1:22:04] didn't say the title of the message
[1:22:05] here, but it was in ' 63. I
[1:22:08] know. Trying to remember what it was
[1:22:10] back there, but Amen. It didn't print it
[1:22:12] out. But he says, "Do you listen?" And
[1:22:14] he says,
[1:22:15] "Notice." He says, "Uh, now
[1:22:17] notice Christ is the mystery of Christ.
[1:22:20] Christ is the mystery of God revealed."
[1:22:22] That's where it was being personally
[1:22:23] identified by the original headship. He
[1:22:26] says, "We have the answer to the devil's
[1:22:29] question."
[1:22:31] Amen. Glory. We have the answer to the
[1:22:33] devil's question. He says it again. He
[1:22:35] says he Christ is risen and has paid the
[1:22:38] price raising up the and he's raising up
[1:22:41] the head the body and the devil can't
[1:22:44] stand it.
[1:22:46] That's the reason the ecumenical
[1:22:47] councils and so forth are setting up.
[1:22:49] That's the reason they're all coming
[1:22:51] together into what they're doing. The
[1:22:52] devil, that's the reason he's howling
[1:22:54] the way he is. Amen. Listen, his scheme
[1:22:58] has been uncovered by the risen
[1:23:00] resurrected Christ in the headship over
[1:23:02] his body. You think I'm beside myself?
[1:23:05] I'm not. We've got the devil's answer.
[1:23:09] How many believe that? We've got the
[1:23:10] answer. He is the answer. Christ is the
[1:23:13] always has been the answer. Amen.
[1:23:18] It's his power. And listen to what he
[1:23:20] says. We got the devil's answer. It's
[1:23:23] not me that
[1:23:24] liveth. It's Christ the word living in
[1:23:28] me.
[1:23:29] It's not my idea. It's his power. not my
[1:23:33] idea. It's his word. He said it would be
[1:23:35] here and here it is. We've got his
[1:23:38] answer. And he goes on, it keeps on
[1:23:41] saying it different times. Next
[1:23:42] scripture down here, he says, "Now are
[1:23:44] we the sons of God? Not we will be. We
[1:23:47] are. We are re now we're redeemed and we
[1:23:52] have Satan's answer. God's vindicating
[1:23:55] himself. God's proved himself to be done
[1:23:57] to promise in this hour. Hallelujah. The
[1:24:00] headship is here. Christ, the risen
[1:24:03] Lord. He's here in the same power of his
[1:24:05] resurrection that he ever was
[1:24:07] manifesting himself. There's the devil's
[1:24:10] answer. Amen. Praise the Lord. What is
[1:24:14] it? Not them people. The headship and
[1:24:16] the body has become one
[1:24:19] unit. It's God manifested in his people.
[1:24:22] How many knows that he was so
[1:24:25] so the body and the head they had come
[1:24:28] together. I like what he says it here.
[1:24:29] He said, "Not will the headship and the
[1:24:32] body has become one unit."
[1:24:36] And I don't believe it was ever
[1:24:37] displayed any better than through the
[1:24:39] prophet of God when God would come down
[1:24:42] and he would use brother Benam's body,
[1:24:44] the head would use the body to speak and
[1:24:47] do the very same things he did when he
[1:24:50] walked the shores of Galilee.
[1:24:56] Amen.
[1:24:58] Praise the Lord. Hopefully, I'll be able
[1:25:01] to express how much that really means
[1:25:04] and what all that means because the
[1:25:07] prophet of God said even that that
[1:25:08] should give that's what gives the bride
[1:25:11] rapturing faith.
[1:25:13] Rapturing
[1:25:15] faith.
[1:25:17] Amen. All
[1:25:21] right. Okay. So we want to start with
[1:25:25] basically the first thing first of all
[1:25:27] let's talk about the condition of the
[1:25:31] leadya number one was that they were
[1:25:35] lukewarm
[1:25:39] lukewarm and I wrote down
[1:25:42] here they're not hot and they're not
[1:25:46] cold they're in between that right not
[1:25:50] hot or cold they don't have a Yes or a
[1:25:53] no. It's just a
[1:25:57] maybe.
[1:25:58] Amen. It's a maybe person. It's a fence
[1:26:02] rider. It's something in between. Ain't
[1:26:05] that right? Look.
[1:26:09] Amen. Fence rider. Not on either
[1:26:13] side. In between. I wrote down here.
[1:26:16] It's in between. Not on either side.
[1:26:18] Uncommitted.
[1:26:21] unsure living in a world of perhaps
[1:26:24] they're not in and they're not
[1:26:29] out. I wanted to read that plaque that
[1:26:33] we have somewhere around here where it
[1:26:34] is preachers in Africa said, "Man, I'm
[1:26:36] committed. I've sold all. I'm all in.
[1:26:39] You know, there's no turning back. I'm
[1:26:42] 100%." How many? That's where we need to
[1:26:44] be. So these people that were lukewarm
[1:26:47] somewhere in between and God says, "I
[1:26:48] don't want you that way." He don't want
[1:26:50] halfway. Amen. Because that's what the
[1:26:53] churches are. Well, this don't really
[1:26:56] matter. Well, that don't really matter.
[1:26:59] God don't care about this. God. Yes, he
[1:27:01] does. Not somewhere in between. No, it's
[1:27:05] hot. It's all for God. It's all in.
[1:27:07] Jesus wants you all in.
[1:27:10] He wants you to not guess.
[1:27:13] Amen. But he wants you all in.
[1:27:18] They were lukewarm.
[1:27:19] had need of
[1:27:22] nothing.
[1:27:25] Amen. The next
[1:27:27] one was because they say that they are
[1:27:31] rich and increased have need of
[1:27:35] nothing. Amen. What a condition to be
[1:27:41] in. Remember Wednesday I said, you know,
[1:27:44] I'm working. I'm wanting to get to the
[1:27:46] place to where I don't need anything.
[1:27:49] How many like to get the hey I don't
[1:27:51] have one need. Amen. Amen. And what is
[1:27:54] that? That is the other side. But
[1:27:57] Abraham says that perfection that you
[1:27:59] thirst for is not for that you don't
[1:28:02] that's not in this side. Now that don't
[1:28:04] mean that you can't be perfect in your
[1:28:06] spirit. Jesus said be you perfect. You
[1:28:08] understand? But as long as you're in
[1:28:10] this body in this flesh, you are going
[1:28:12] to make mistakes. You are going to not
[1:28:14] think the way you should or you're going
[1:28:15] to say something that you shouldn't say
[1:28:17] at the wrong time.
[1:28:19] Ain't that right? You're going to mess
[1:28:21] up. Why? Because that's what this is.
[1:28:25] Amen. And and I said over there and then
[1:28:28] listen to what he says. You know, he
[1:28:29] says, "Thou sayest, I am in increased
[1:28:31] with goods." This literally means they
[1:28:34] think they're spiritually rich. This
[1:28:36] sounds like the millennium streets of
[1:28:39] gold in the presence of God. rich and
[1:28:42] increased in goods have need of nothing.
[1:28:45] Huh? So yeah, when we get over there,
[1:28:48] we're not going to be needy
[1:28:50] anymore. We're not going to have a need
[1:28:52] when you get over there. Praise the
[1:28:54] Lord. But Abraham says it's just How do
[1:28:56] you explain it? He said, "You had just
[1:28:58] arrived. We have arrived. We're there."
[1:29:02] Amen. We've been wanting to be here,
[1:29:03] wanting to be here, but now here we are.
[1:29:07] Amen. Perfection, satisfaction,
[1:29:10] completeness. There's no word for it.
[1:29:13] No word to describe how perfect it is
[1:29:15] over there. Amen. And that's what we're
[1:29:18] striving
[1:29:19] for. Amen. Now, the reason I want to
[1:29:21] look at the condition of the church
[1:29:23] because you know you and I were at that
[1:29:25] in this in this in this condition. Is
[1:29:28] that right? How many believe we were in
[1:29:29] that condition? Especially if you were
[1:29:31] in a denomination, you were in that
[1:29:33] condition. They're just lukewarm.
[1:29:37] Amen. They're miserable, wretched, poor,
[1:29:40] blind, and naked. Maybe some of I don't
[1:29:43] some of us perhaps didn't even think we
[1:29:44] had need of anything.
[1:29:47] But then God come along.
[1:29:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:53] My no and then he says, "Have nothing."
[1:29:56] Now when people anybody says that I have
[1:29:58] need of nothing, he says you could very
[1:30:00] well be saying I have everything.
[1:30:05] Or he could be saying, "I don't want
[1:30:07] anymore as I am full." Ain't that
[1:30:11] exactly right? Well, this is what we
[1:30:12] believe. It doesn't matter what you got
[1:30:14] to say. No more truth. We put a period
[1:30:17] behind what we believe. We are what we
[1:30:19] are.
[1:30:21] They're satisfied being where they are.
[1:30:26] They don't think they need anything
[1:30:27] anymore.
[1:30:30] I don't want anymore as I am now full.
[1:30:33] Amen. And you can express it this any
[1:30:36] way that you want to. And it all ends up
[1:30:39] to the fact that the church is
[1:30:40] complacent. She is satisfied with what
[1:30:43] she has. Amen. She either figures she
[1:30:47] has it all or has enough. And that is
[1:30:51] what we find today. Amen. That's how
[1:30:54] people end up talking about how that the
[1:30:56] Pentecostals represented that Leodysia
[1:30:59] church.
[1:31:01] Amen.
[1:31:03] Praise the Lord. So what we want to look
[1:31:06] at with the help of the Lord once we get
[1:31:07] through looking at the symptoms and and
[1:31:09] the condition of the leotans, they
[1:31:12] thought they were
[1:31:13] rich. But how many know that's not true
[1:31:16] riches?
[1:31:19] What is true riches? What is the gold?
[1:31:22] Is that
[1:31:23] right? What was God asking in verse 18?
[1:31:28] I counsel thee to bow me gold tried in
[1:31:30] the fire. Notice I am rich and increased
[1:31:33] with goods. Have need of nothing and
[1:31:34] knowest
[1:31:35] not. Amen. Brother Brandham, I was
[1:31:39] listening to brother Brandham before
[1:31:41] going to bed the other day and I just
[1:31:43] picked up a picked one out of 1965 and
[1:31:47] it was called and knoweth it not. And
[1:31:49] brother Bam says now I don't know where
[1:31:50] I'm going to go when he come up here,
[1:31:52] brother Brian. He was in one of your
[1:31:54] situations now. I don't know what I'm
[1:31:56] going to
[1:31:57] say. So we'll just go from here. and he
[1:32:00] preached on and knoweth it not. Somehow
[1:32:02] he got on that, looked at his few
[1:32:04] scriptures and so forth and and and and
[1:32:07] just preached a good message. Amen.
[1:32:09] Praise the
[1:32:11] Lord. Amen. God is good, isn't he?
[1:32:17] Amen. Praise the Lord. I was back there
[1:32:20] listening to Brother Brian and you know,
[1:32:24] I like what he said. He said, "Now I'm
[1:32:25] gonna go slow. I'm going to take my
[1:32:26] time." I said, "Well, that's good.
[1:32:28] That's a good move.
[1:32:30] And in between in between the times he
[1:32:32] wasn't sure what he was going to say, he
[1:32:33] said some good stuff. Amen. I got He
[1:32:36] says God, you know, he said, I don't
[1:32:39] know why I'm going on this, just to give
[1:32:40] him a little flower, I guess, but do
[1:32:42] little things. How many knows God
[1:32:44] doesn't sometimes want you to do big
[1:32:46] things that everybody in the message,
[1:32:47] hey, everybody, oh, it's all about maybe
[1:32:49] it's maybe it's a little selfishness in
[1:32:51] you wanting recognition. Hello. But God
[1:32:54] wants those little things. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:56] Re recognize God doing and working in
[1:32:59] you in the little things. Amen. And God
[1:33:01] is never far away. He's right here.
[1:33:03] Amen. That's another good point he made.
[1:33:05] Amen. Praise the Lord. He did say
[1:33:08] manufacture instead of manifest. Now,
[1:33:11] we're going to manifest these here, but
[1:33:13] that's all right. I do that all the
[1:33:15] time. I wish somebody tell me. Well,
[1:33:17] some people do that. Brother B. How you
[1:33:19] you know cuz even brother Bram said 7
[1:33:21] thou 700 and 7,000 or 7,000 whichever
[1:33:25] way it was. Y'all know what I'm talking
[1:33:26] about. He said it backwards. But anyway,
[1:33:29] praise the
[1:33:30] Lord. Amen. Put the in other words he's
[1:33:33] not something else he said was put amen
[1:33:35] your sins in the sea of his
[1:33:36] forgetfulness. Amen. Never to be
[1:33:38] remembered no more. And I liked it
[1:33:40] because we've been fishing the last
[1:33:41] couple days and and don't go fishing for
[1:33:44] it. Amen. Because I'll tell you what,
[1:33:45] how many knows the devil will sure give
[1:33:46] you a fishing pole. He will hand you a
[1:33:49] fishing pole. Say, "Hey, don't you
[1:33:50] remember what you did over there and
[1:33:52] don't you know this side of the bank? Go
[1:33:54] fish out of there a little bit. You
[1:33:55] remember just just get out of here. Take
[1:33:57] your fishing pole and get lost." Praise
[1:33:59] be to God. So let's look at this. So he
[1:34:02] says, "Now the next thing he says, you
[1:34:03] have say that you have and knowest not
[1:34:06] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[1:34:09] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:34:12] naked." Hallelujah. What a condition.
[1:34:15] Amen.
[1:34:18] Now, how many know this is the condition
[1:34:19] that the devil got the church into?
[1:34:25] He got her into this
[1:34:27] condition. They were wretched,
[1:34:29] miserable, poor, blind, and naked and
[1:34:32] didn't know
[1:34:35] it. You know what else they didn't know?
[1:34:37] I I you know, I highly doubt it. Anyway,
[1:34:40] I'll put it this way. I had Pentecostals
[1:34:42] even recognized or believe that they had
[1:34:45] actually put him outside of the church.
[1:34:48] How many know that Pentecostal
[1:34:49] organization in ' 63 said, "Don't you go
[1:34:51] to any brother Benham's meetings.
[1:34:53] Anybody that does will be
[1:34:54] excommunicated. Your name will be taken
[1:34:56] off." Even brother Bam had to deal with
[1:34:58] him. A preacher called him up. He says,
[1:35:00] "Now, he participated in your meeting.
[1:35:02] We're going to have to take his book
[1:35:03] off. Name off the book."
[1:35:06] Isn't that right? And Brother Bam says,
[1:35:08] "Well, that does that mean he's lost?"
[1:35:09] Yeah, it means he's lost. He says, "Get
[1:35:11] off the phone, mister. You blind
[1:35:13] Pharisee." Almost.
[1:35:15] Huh? Aggravated. Do you mean to tell me
[1:35:18] just because you think that you take
[1:35:19] somebody off of your book, they're not
[1:35:20] going to make it?
[1:35:24] Hello. What a place. Christ was outside
[1:35:28] of the church. He wasn't in it
[1:35:32] anymore. Now, let me ask you, if Christ
[1:35:35] was
[1:35:36] outside, where are you going to have to
[1:35:38] go to see him? Where are you going to
[1:35:39] have to go to meet
[1:35:41] him? You're going to have to go outside.
[1:35:44] You're going to have to go out. But
[1:35:46] we'll get into that in a
[1:35:47] minute. Praise the
[1:35:51] Lord. Oh my. So, look at
[1:35:55] that. Now, now God says, I counsel thee
[1:35:59] if you want to be rich. If you want to
[1:36:01] be rich, I counsel thee to buy of me
[1:36:04] gold tried in the fire that thou mayest
[1:36:07] be
[1:36:09] rich. Amen. Peter says, "The trial of
[1:36:12] your faith being much more precious than
[1:36:15] that of gold that perishes." Ain't that
[1:36:17] right? So the gold that God is looking
[1:36:22] for. Amen. Not only the gold, but also
[1:36:26] the clothes,
[1:36:28] the clothes that we wear.
[1:36:31] because he says and that thou mayest be
[1:36:34] rich and white raignment that thou
[1:36:37] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[1:36:40] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[1:36:43] that eyes with eyes that thou mayest
[1:36:45] see. So he God wants us you wants you to
[1:36:47] be rich. We need to be
[1:36:49] rich in God. Ain't that right? Rich in
[1:36:53] God. We need to have reignment because
[1:36:56] we know the clothes that we wear. Amen.
[1:36:58] over in Revelations 19, she was given
[1:37:01] white raignment, the white garments
[1:37:02] where the righteousness of the saints.
[1:37:05] So it's important that you have clothed
[1:37:07] that the shame of your nakedness do not
[1:37:09] appear. Amen. And the other one was that
[1:37:12] eyes with Isa that you can see.
[1:37:16] Amen.
[1:37:22] That thou mayest be able to see. As many
[1:37:24] as I love, I rebuke and chase. Be
[1:37:26] zealous therefore and
[1:37:30] repent. Amen. So let me ask you
[1:37:35] this because this morning I want to go
[1:37:37] for a little while with the help of the
[1:37:39] Lord and that is to show us really cause
[1:37:44] us to appreciate what God has done and
[1:37:46] what this message means to us.
[1:37:49] What the message really means.
[1:37:53] Amen.
[1:37:57] Amen.
[1:38:06] Now, listen. The Leodysia age, Brother
[1:38:09] Brand is saying the Leosia church is
[1:38:11] saying, "I'm in reach, rich, and
[1:38:13] increase with
[1:38:15] good and have need of nothing." Wait a
[1:38:18] minute. This is not the one I'm looking
[1:38:21] for. All right. Now, listen. He says,
[1:38:24] "The word has been put aside." So God
[1:38:26] says, "I am going against you all. I
[1:38:30] will spew thee out of my mouth." How
[1:38:32] many know? Because they were lukewarm.
[1:38:33] God was going to spew them out of his
[1:38:35] mouth. He said, "This is the end. Seven
[1:38:38] ages. I've seen nothing but men
[1:38:40] deceiving their own word above mine. So
[1:38:43] at the end of this age, I am spewing you
[1:38:45] out of my mouth. It's all over. I'm
[1:38:47] going to speak." All right. Yes. I am
[1:38:50] here in the midst of the church. Amen.
[1:38:51] The amen of God, the faithful and true,
[1:38:54] Amen. will reveal himself and it will be
[1:38:57] by my prophet.
[1:39:00] Amen.
[1:39:03] Oh yes. This is Revelations 10:7. In the
[1:39:07] days of the voice of the seventh and
[1:39:08] messenger, when he shall begin to sound,
[1:39:10] the mystery of God should be finished as
[1:39:12] he has declared to his servants the
[1:39:14] prophets. There it is. He is sending a
[1:39:16] vindicated prophet. He is sending a
[1:39:18] prophet after almost 2,000 years. He is
[1:39:21] sending someone who is so far from
[1:39:23] organization and education than the
[1:39:25] world of religion as John the Baptist
[1:39:27] was and Elijah of old. He will hear only
[1:39:30] from God and he will have thus sayeth
[1:39:32] the Lord and speak for God. He will be
[1:39:35] God's
[1:39:39] mouthpiece as it is declared in Malachi
[1:39:42] 4. Amen. And he will bring back the
[1:39:46] elect to the of the last day. All right,
[1:39:48] I'm going to stop right there.
[1:39:50] and go to Malachi real quick. Malachi 4
[1:39:54] says in verse 5, "Behold, I will send
[1:39:56] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[1:39:58] of the great and dreadful day of the
[1:39:59] Lord." "And he shall turn the hearts of
[1:40:02] the children uh fathers to the children,
[1:40:05] and the hearts of the children to the
[1:40:07] fathers, least I come and smite the
[1:40:10] earth with a curse."
[1:40:15] I asked my wife, we was riding down the
[1:40:16] road and I says, "I wonder what that
[1:40:21] curse what he was talking about. What
[1:40:24] curse was God going to strike the earth
[1:40:27] with?" I challenge anybody, minister,
[1:40:30] anybody that knows uh whether brother
[1:40:33] Brandham actually explained what that
[1:40:35] curse is, I don't know. Amen. So, if
[1:40:39] anybody knows, let me know.
[1:40:41] All I know is
[1:40:43] this. We're already living in the curse.
[1:40:46] I mean, know God cursed the earth. He
[1:40:48] cursed the ground that he was on and it
[1:40:50] brought spindles and it brought in
[1:40:52] Murphy's law. Everything that can go
[1:40:54] wrong will go wrong. The curse is death
[1:40:57] itself. Having to get old and gray hair
[1:40:59] is a curse. Ain't that right? Feebleness
[1:41:01] is a curse. All of that is a curse. And
[1:41:04] so, if God was going to curse it
[1:41:07] double, it was going to be a double
[1:41:09] curse twice. We're ready. And then he
[1:41:11] going to do it
[1:41:12] again. It would be pretty bad, wouldn't
[1:41:15] it? And let me ask you something. Look
[1:41:17] out there. Tell me it ain't real bad.
[1:41:21] It is double bad out there. That's
[1:41:23] right. Why? Because they haven't come to
[1:41:25] Malachi 4. How many believe that the
[1:41:28] answer to
[1:41:30] Leadsia was re Malachi 4? Revelations
[1:41:33] 10:7. That was God's
[1:41:35] answer. That was God supplying our need.
[1:41:42] Amen. Why? We had need of what? We had
[1:41:45] need of restoration. We were in bad
[1:41:48] shape. We were miserable, wretched,
[1:41:50] poor, blind, and naked.
[1:41:53] Caleb, young man, where do you think we
[1:41:56] would be? Where would I be? Where would
[1:41:59] you be if it wouldn't have been for God
[1:42:02] sending Malachi?
[1:42:04] Where would you be if it wasn't for God
[1:42:06] sending a I'll tell you where it'd be.
[1:42:08] you'd be in that leadya condition.
[1:42:11] Ain't no telling what condition. It'd be
[1:42:13] a terrible condition to be in. But how
[1:42:16] many know God has called us out of that
[1:42:18] Leodysia age? He's called us out of
[1:42:20] Leodysia.
[1:42:22] Amen. We're thankful for that. God
[1:42:24] answers it. Brother Bandam 63 in the
[1:42:27] third exodus preaches about three
[1:42:29] Exodus. We are in an Exodus and in
[1:42:32] leaving and turning the pages off in a
[1:42:34] moment, they're turning tapes off in a
[1:42:36] moment. Amen. He says, 'Oh my friends,
[1:42:39] my brothers, both present here and in
[1:42:41] those that'll hear the tapes, let me ask
[1:42:44] your brother and your citizens of the
[1:42:45] kingdom of God, he says, come out in
[1:42:48] this Exodus. How many know there was a
[1:42:50] cry that went out, amen, the only way
[1:42:52] that you can Amen. get out of this
[1:42:54] condition is to come out of her.
[1:42:58] There was a time when God was in all of
[1:43:00] those denominations. Hello. There was a
[1:43:02] time when brother Bam said, "Find you a
[1:43:04] church. Find you a church. Find you a
[1:43:06] church." all those converts. He filled
[1:43:08] churches up, people. But look at it
[1:43:11] later in his ministry, you'll find out.
[1:43:13] He says, you know, you can't belong to a
[1:43:15] man-made system and be the bride of Come
[1:43:17] out of her. It's time to get out of
[1:43:19] there.
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:21] That's right. And so God was calling out
[1:43:23] cuz I'm going to do something for you.
[1:43:25] I'm going to do something that you ain't
[1:43:26] can't even imagine what God has done.
[1:43:30] Hallelujah. He's going to bring us out.
[1:43:32] You got to get out of that thing cuz God
[1:43:35] ain't in it anymore.
[1:43:37] We don't draw inspiration. We go do have
[1:43:40] nothing to do with that system. But the
[1:43:42] Bible says if you Oh, he'll just say it.
[1:43:44] He'll say to be in it is in the mark of
[1:43:46] the beast. Listen to this. Oh, let me
[1:43:48] say as your brothers and sisters came,
[1:43:50] come out in this Exodus, for all that's
[1:43:52] left behind will bear the mark of the
[1:43:55] beast. Come out of Babylon. Come out of
[1:43:58] this confusion. Amen.
[1:44:01] Hallelujah. How many know it's no wonder
[1:44:03] they were lukewarm? No wonder they were
[1:44:05] in between. Which organization's right?
[1:44:08] Which denomination's right? Which church
[1:44:09] is right? Why are we preachers? Amen.
[1:44:12] Always talking about these denominations
[1:44:14] and these churches and condemning them
[1:44:15] and so forth. Because God condemned
[1:44:17] them.
[1:44:19] Cuz they threw him out. They put him
[1:44:22] out. Now he's putting them out. And he's
[1:44:23] getting his people out of there.
[1:44:26] Cuz you can't get blessed there. You
[1:44:28] can't get rich there. You can't have the
[1:44:30] clothes that you need in a denomination.
[1:44:33] And that clothing is that character.
[1:44:39] Amen. All right. Come out of Babylon,
[1:44:42] this confusion, out of these systems,
[1:44:45] and serve the living God. And let this
[1:44:48] great angel of the covenant, Jesus, in
[1:44:50] the form of God, thought it thought it
[1:44:53] not robberly become equal. He's the
[1:44:54] pillar of fire, the same form he was
[1:44:56] back there bringing that first exodus,
[1:44:59] bringing that sex second exodus. And
[1:45:02] here he is bringing the third
[1:45:05] exodus. He says the first exodus, what
[1:45:08] did he do? He brought him out of a
[1:45:09] natural land. Ain't that right? The
[1:45:11] second exit, he brought him out of a
[1:45:13] spiritual condition and a spiritual
[1:45:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost. In other
[1:45:16] words, when Christ came, Amen, he turned
[1:45:19] the hearts of the fathers. He was trying
[1:45:20] to get him out. He had to get him out of
[1:45:22] there. scribes and Pharisees crucified
[1:45:24] him. So guess what? That was over with.
[1:45:26] Trying to get him out of it was Exodus
[1:45:28] time. That was the second thing. Now
[1:45:30] he's bringing a spirit, bringing them
[1:45:32] from his spiritual to the Holy Ghost,
[1:45:34] right back into the eternal land of the
[1:45:36] millennium and into the great hereafter,
[1:45:39] the same pillar of fire by the same
[1:45:41] anointed. Amen. system, the same God
[1:45:44] doing the same things, the same word
[1:45:46] declaring the as he did the first one,
[1:45:48] declared the second one. And the same
[1:45:51] word is declaring the second one is now
[1:45:53] declaring the third one. And here we see
[1:45:55] it among us. Come out. Oh, come out of
[1:45:57] this
[1:45:58] chaos. Come to the living God. Come to
[1:46:01] the word. And the word was made flesh
[1:46:03] and dwelt among us. Oh my. He is in our
[1:46:06] flesh dwelling among us. Come out and
[1:46:09] serve the living God. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:11] Brother Brandon then bows his heads.
[1:46:13] Praise the Lord. Oh my. He says, "From
[1:46:16] the depths of your soul." Paul, as we
[1:46:17] bow our heads, he says, "From the
[1:46:19] depths, that's all that's in you." If
[1:46:21] you are willing, remember if you're
[1:46:22] ready to stop all of the things of the
[1:46:24] world and live for God. Amen. You didn't
[1:46:27] mean this. You don't you don't do it.
[1:46:29] But if you listen, don't do it if you
[1:46:32] don't mean it. You got to really mean
[1:46:33] it. Amen. If you're really convinced,
[1:46:37] and Jesus said in the end of his
[1:46:38] ministry, "Do you now believe? Are you
[1:46:41] convinced that these things are right,
[1:46:42] vindicated by God, that we're at the end
[1:46:44] time, and you truly want to come to
[1:46:46] Christ now? come into his exodus of
[1:46:48] calling out of indifference and
[1:46:50] denominations and ideas and things of
[1:46:52] the world. If you want to surrender
[1:46:54] wholeheartedly to him in and come out in
[1:46:57] his exodus for the blessed promised
[1:46:59] land. Amen. He says, "Will you raise
[1:47:01] your hand?" Amen. To him. How many
[1:47:04] believes that?
[1:47:06] Amen. So, we find that the answer to
[1:47:09] Leosa was Malachi 4. It was the seventh
[1:47:13] angel. Amen. calling people out.
[1:47:17] So that you aren't part of that same
[1:47:19] curse. Amen. That people live under.
[1:47:22] Amen. And let me just say this. Revel
[1:47:25] Malachi 4. Amen. Also takes us to
[1:47:29] Revelations 18 and1. Revelations 18, not
[1:47:32] one, but um let me see here. If you want
[1:47:35] to turn to it, you can. Now I want to
[1:47:37] read this because I always like to make
[1:47:39] p full proof whenever you are uh
[1:47:42] preaching and and teaching like what we
[1:47:44] are this morning. You like to make sure
[1:47:46] that it lines up with the word. Ain't
[1:47:47] that right?
[1:47:49] Now notice here in Revelations 18. So
[1:47:51] Malachi 4 also produced Revelations 18.
[1:47:55] And after these things I saw another
[1:47:57] angel come down from heaven having great
[1:47:59] power and the earth was lightened with
[1:48:01] his glory. And he cried mightily with
[1:48:04] his strong voice, saying, "Babylon the
[1:48:07] great is fallen, is fallen, has become
[1:48:09] the habitation of devils, and the hold
[1:48:12] of every foul spirit, and the cage of
[1:48:14] every unclean and hateful bird."
[1:48:17] Amen. For all nations have drunk of the
[1:48:20] wine of the wrath of her fornication,
[1:48:22] and the kings of the earth have
[1:48:24] committed fornications with her, and the
[1:48:26] merchants of the earth are waxed rich
[1:48:29] through her delic the abundance of her
[1:48:31] delicacies.
[1:48:33] Amen. All about the mighty dollar.
[1:48:35] Listen. How many knows that that woman
[1:48:37] is a rich? That harlot is a rich. She's
[1:48:39] rich and creeped with goods.
[1:48:42] But listen to this. And I heard a voice,
[1:48:44] another voice from heaven saying, "Come
[1:48:47] out of her, my people, that you be not
[1:48:51] partakers of her sins, and that you
[1:48:53] receive not her plagues." How many know
[1:48:56] she's got plagues coming for sins have
[1:48:58] reached? Brother Bam uh speaking this.
[1:49:01] He says after these things I saw another
[1:49:02] angel come down from heaven having great
[1:49:05] power. Now here comes another messenger
[1:49:07] coming down. He says her mystery has
[1:49:09] been discovered. Now is now this is now
[1:49:12] the discovery of her mystery and her
[1:49:14] children's mysteries. See we understand
[1:49:17] now exactly what made her a harlot
[1:49:19] because she committed adultery against
[1:49:22] God's word. She takes man's word over
[1:49:24] God's word. How many know you and I we
[1:49:28] are we don't have a brother Brandon B.
[1:49:30] We don't have a man birth. We have a
[1:49:32] word birth. Brother Brandham, God used
[1:49:35] brother Brandham to bring us to a word
[1:49:37] birth. Amen. You don't listen to the
[1:49:40] pastor. Even if it isn't subject to the
[1:49:42] word, if it's not according to the word,
[1:49:45] we don't hear it cuz we're a word bride.
[1:49:47] We are part of him.
[1:49:49] Hallelujah.
[1:49:52] Glory. Now remember, remember this. Now
[1:49:55] remember this. Brother Bam says the lid
[1:49:57] has come off of hell and streams and
[1:50:00] streams of demon powers are coming out
[1:50:02] upon the earth. How many knows they're
[1:50:04] in politics? They've taken over
[1:50:06] politics. He says they've taken over
[1:50:08] this that and the other. You can see it
[1:50:09] in the people and they've absolutely
[1:50:11] taken over the churches.
[1:50:14] Whenever those preachers would say,
[1:50:16] "Look now our church don't believe
[1:50:17] that." Even though there Jesus Christ
[1:50:19] would come and vindicate it and it be
[1:50:21] according to the word, they would take
[1:50:23] their own ideas above God's word. They
[1:50:25] exalted the devil to where he wanted to
[1:50:28] be. Why was that? That was devil power.
[1:50:31] Those were spiritual religious demon
[1:50:34] powers. Amen. Demons and streams of
[1:50:36] them. Amen. And if there are streams of
[1:50:38] demons coming out of the hell, the lid
[1:50:40] of hell, then how many know there's got
[1:50:42] to be an answer. There has got to be
[1:50:45] something that God doesn't respond. And
[1:50:47] I want you to know that God did. He said
[1:50:49] before the oh before the foundation of
[1:50:52] the new world. Amen. Even way back in
[1:50:54] the Old Testament, he wrote that in
[1:50:56] Malachi 4, I'm going to have to send
[1:50:58] Malachi 4. Amen. If these people are
[1:51:01] ever going to be victorious, if they're
[1:51:02] ever ever going to have joy unspeakable,
[1:51:04] if they're ever going to come out of
[1:51:06] their wretched and miserable, amen, in
[1:51:08] their
[1:51:09] lukewarm condition. I'm going to have to
[1:51:11] breathe. I'm going to have to show signs
[1:51:13] and wonders. I'm going to show myself
[1:51:15] alive like never before. infallible
[1:51:18] proofs. Amen. It's going to bring them
[1:51:20] to a rapturing faith. It's going to
[1:51:22] bring them to a rapture. Amen. A perfect
[1:51:24] faith. It's going to give them perfect
[1:51:26] love. It's going to give them victory.
[1:51:29] [Applause]
[1:51:31] How many glad for it?
[1:51:34] We're not sitting around, well, we're in
[1:51:37] church again.
[1:51:41] Come on, people. This is not just about
[1:51:43] having a service on Sunday morning. This
[1:51:45] is about coming together and hearing the
[1:51:47] word of God and worshiping him.
[1:51:52] Oh, praise be to God.
[1:51:58] All right. Come out of her. How many
[1:52:00] believes that's the call?
[1:52:03] We've heard it. You can hear it on tape.
[1:52:04] Come out.
[1:52:07] Get out of there.
[1:52:10] Amen. Partakers of it. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:52:15] So now look produces revelations there
[1:52:18] and I I didn't read all of that. I just
[1:52:20] want to read a little more if I could.
[1:52:22] Amen. Listen. So he says, "Brother Brand
[1:52:24] reads that scripture the 18th chapter. A
[1:52:26] mighty angel after the mystery was made
[1:52:29] known. A messenger." He says, "Look,
[1:52:32] immediately her mystery was made known.
[1:52:34] Who she was, what she was, who her
[1:52:36] daughters were. The mystery has been
[1:52:38] made known. Then God sent another angel,
[1:52:40] a messenger. What? To call out. Come on.
[1:52:43] the message of the hour. How many
[1:52:46] believes we've heard the message of the
[1:52:48] hour? Come out of here, my people.
[1:52:50] Hallelujah. A mighty angel. But Abraham
[1:52:52] says, you know, it wasn't done in a
[1:52:53] mystery. It wasn't done in a He says,
[1:52:56] listen to what he says. And his light
[1:52:58] wasn't in a corner. It was scattered
[1:53:00] over the earth. How many know he went
[1:53:02] around the world seven times to Hindu,
[1:53:04] to Buddhas, all of them. He the whole
[1:53:07] earth was lightened with his glory.
[1:53:13] The whole people of the earth should
[1:53:14] have accepted it and received it.
[1:53:20] Amen.
[1:53:25] Why are we so hard on churches? Baptist,
[1:53:28] Methodist, Presbyterian, Amish, Menite,
[1:53:32] all of them. I'm here to tell you, they
[1:53:35] have rejected Jesus Christ. Amen. They
[1:53:38] have turned him down.
[1:53:41] And that's putting it mildly. Let me put
[1:53:43] it the way that brother Bannon put it.
[1:53:44] He says, "I indict this clergy, this
[1:53:47] bunch of preachers, these bunch of
[1:53:48] churches, I indict them for the second
[1:53:50] crucifixion of Jesus Christ, they have
[1:53:52] crucified the effects of the word by
[1:53:55] taking their man-made creeds and their
[1:53:57] dogmas." Why do you think when God used
[1:53:59] brother B, he thought that everybody
[1:54:00] should believe it, everybody should come
[1:54:02] to it and he rejected and rejected and
[1:54:04] didn't want it anymore until he just
[1:54:06] wanted to go up in the mountains and
[1:54:07] come out whenever God has something for
[1:54:09] him to say. He got discouraged with
[1:54:11] people because they rejected Christ.
[1:54:16] And with that rejection comes a penalty.
[1:54:18] Ain't that right? You're cursed with
[1:54:21] what? Death. Amen. Not even know it.
[1:54:26] You can't tell them. They won't hear it.
[1:54:28] They don't have ears to hear
[1:54:30] it. How many's glad that God has brought
[1:54:34] us some eyes? He's brought us the
[1:54:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you
[1:54:38] could see your condition this morning.
[1:54:40] You can see whether you're lukewarm or
[1:54:41] not. Amen. You could see whether you
[1:54:43] needed some clothes on or not. Amen. You
[1:54:45] don't have to walk around naked. Amen.
[1:54:47] You can walk around with the character
[1:54:49] of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:50] [Applause]
[1:54:55] Amen. Not only that, but Revelations 18
[1:54:58] takes us to Revelations
[1:55:01] 4:1. And that is the beginning of the
[1:55:04] coming
[1:55:05] out. This is where it
[1:55:07] starts. Amen. I love Revelations.
[1:55:11] Remember, here we are in the bride.
[1:55:14] Now, Revelations 4:1 says, "After this,
[1:55:18] I looked and behold opened in heaven,
[1:55:20] and the first voice which I heard was as
[1:55:22] it were a trumpet saying unto me." Which
[1:55:25] said, remember John being a type of the
[1:55:28] believer said, "Come up higher. Come up
[1:55:32] here. Come up higher." How many believe
[1:55:34] we got to live higher than Leodysia?
[1:55:36] Higher than lukewarmness, higher than
[1:55:38] miserableness,
[1:55:42] nakedness, not knowing it. No. Come on
[1:55:45] up here. I want to show you some things.
[1:55:48] How many know that God by by fornowledge
[1:55:51] had Malachi 4, the Sabbath angel's
[1:55:53] message? Amen. The mystery of God should
[1:55:55] be finished to his servants.
[1:55:57] Amen. In our case, it's not I will show
[1:55:59] you things to come, but in our case,
[1:56:02] it's come up higher and I will show you
[1:56:04] things that has been.
[1:56:07] Didn't Butterb say that God has shown us
[1:56:10] the back part of his mind.
[1:56:13] God opened by revelations what he did
[1:56:16] back there. He kept it hid amen until
[1:56:18] the last hour. Then he shows what he
[1:56:20] did.
[1:56:23] We didn't have no idea what these
[1:56:25] symbols were. We know what all these
[1:56:27] symbols and these different things were
[1:56:28] until the prophet of God come along.
[1:56:31] Hallelujah.
[1:56:33] I will show you these things which must
[1:56:35] be hereafter. And immediately I was in
[1:56:38] the spirit. Didn't brother B preach that
[1:56:39] when he preached the church ages. He
[1:56:41] says what did he say going to do? If you
[1:56:43] want more revelation, if you want more
[1:56:44] of God, you want more victory. Amen.
[1:56:46] It's time that you don't go just through
[1:56:48] the motions.
[1:56:50] Amen. But get in the spirit.
[1:56:54] getting in the spirit. How many knows
[1:56:57] that's what Malachi did? That's how he
[1:56:59] was going to counteract. Amen. A
[1:57:00] lukewarm dead church. Amen. He's going
[1:57:03] to get a people that's got the Holy
[1:57:04] Ghost. Amen. Got the spirit on them.
[1:57:08] Amen. Y'all quiet this morning.
[1:57:13] Amen. That's the
[1:57:16] truth. Church ages begins to reveal the
[1:57:19] church ages right there. begin to show
[1:57:21] how that the devil would come in and
[1:57:23] show all of his tactics. Brother Bam
[1:57:25] says me know he used to spar and his and
[1:57:28] his and and his instructor. Amen. You
[1:57:30] would look at the enemy and how how he
[1:57:32] does and how which punch he throws.
[1:57:33] Amen. You would practice that so that
[1:57:35] you could counter that and then learn to
[1:57:37] Amen. As a Christian, we have to have
[1:57:39] both defense and offense. Amen. When God
[1:57:42] the devil punches at something, you
[1:57:44] block it with prayer. Ain't that right?
[1:57:45] And then give him a right hand. Say,
[1:57:48] "Get on out of here, devil."
[1:57:50] We learned his tactics and God and by
[1:57:52] his help. Amen. Said in the day that the
[1:57:54] son of man or the son of predition is
[1:57:55] revealed. I mean believe we living in
[1:57:57] the hour when that the son of the devil
[1:58:00] son of predition's been revealed. He was
[1:58:03] the son of predition.
[1:58:05] He was the devil's son. Showed us the
[1:58:08] truth of it all.
[1:58:11] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:58:16] My
[1:58:16] my how many believe we have need of
[1:58:20] having our hearts restored back to the
[1:58:23] faith of the fathers. We had need of
[1:58:26] restoration.
[1:58:28] In other words, all of these things that
[1:58:30] got all scrubbled up, all messed up
[1:58:32] through the church ages.
[1:58:35] Amen.
[1:58:39] So messed up. The Baptist, they had so
[1:58:41] eternal security. I'm saved. Give me
[1:58:43] another Budweiser. Might as well have
[1:58:45] been her. Let me have another smoke. I'm
[1:58:48] saved. Huh? That's right.
[1:58:53] Hello. Women up here. Pentecostal women
[1:58:56] up here in pants and dancing around
[1:58:58] makeup, cut hair. Hallelujah. That's
[1:59:01] right. Messed up.
[1:59:04] Don't have it right. We had a lot of
[1:59:06] loose ends that God came down and he be
[1:59:08] to tie them up. In other words, we had a
[1:59:10] lot of cankerworm and caterpillar and
[1:59:12] all of these. Amen. They eaten it all
[1:59:14] the way until it was a layout of sea
[1:59:16] condition. It was wretched, miserable,
[1:59:18] fruitless, loveless, cold church.
[1:59:24] Amen. Me and my wife went to yesterday.
[1:59:27] My wife got a little happy. You know, my
[1:59:28] wife gets a little happy sometimes.
[1:59:30] She's glad for the god thing that God
[1:59:32] had done. Got the screaming a little.
[1:59:34] Some message believer turning their
[1:59:36] head. Who's screaming back there? And
[1:59:37] I'm like, I had to think about what
[1:59:39] brother Van says. People think and
[1:59:40] wondering what's going on here. Well,
[1:59:43] you don't know what I know what God's
[1:59:44] done for me. Amen. If you know what God
[1:59:46] done for me for you, you'd scream a
[1:59:48] little, too. You'd have a good
[1:59:51] time. Woo. Now, I think about what God
[1:59:54] has done in this hour and through the
[1:59:56] message of the hour. What he's done.
[1:59:59] Buds, I'm here to tell you that all of
[2:00:01] hell has let loose. All of hell has come
[2:00:04] after us. But all of heaven has let
[2:00:06] loose too. All the angels, there's
[2:00:08] angels around us looking at the unseen.
[2:00:11] We know that there's angels around here.
[2:00:13] They're influencing you. They're trying
[2:00:15] to anoint you. Amen. To believe God's
[2:00:18] word that all things are possible.
[2:00:21] To him that believes, that's what
[2:00:24] they're doing. Hallelujah. How many
[2:00:27] believe we've got power?
[2:00:30] The power of God has been unleashed.
[2:00:32] Amen. It has been loosed. We're tapping
[2:00:36] into those untapped resources.
[2:00:40] Ain't that right? What are those
[2:00:42] resources? God's word is his resources.
[2:01:05] I like
[2:01:06] it. I could preach a message for a long
[2:01:09] time on chapter 4 verse one. The first
[2:01:12] four words after
[2:01:17] this. After
[2:01:19] this I
[2:01:21] looked.
[2:01:23] Afterwards, I
[2:01:26] looked. Apparently, John didn't have a
[2:01:29] need, right? He was in the spirit and he
[2:01:33] looked. That's what we do after this
[2:01:37] church age. We look. Yes. What do we do?
[2:01:40] We look up
[2:01:43] and we
[2:01:45] hear. He that heareth my
[2:01:48] voice. Isn't that what that what
[2:01:50] Leodysia daddy
[2:01:54] said? If any man hear my voice
[2:01:58] and open the door, how many believes
[2:02:01] that it took a looking
[2:02:03] up that's quite quite something how
[2:02:06] brother Bam takes in the church age book
[2:02:08] here and he and he begins to bring in
[2:02:10] Malachi 4. Another place he was talking
[2:02:12] about the same subject and begin to how
[2:02:14] my little eagle story. How many knows
[2:02:17] that we're in a eagle age? We have
[2:02:18] caught gotten caught up into an eagle
[2:02:20] age. That's right. Come on up higher.
[2:02:24] Hear that voice of God calling.
[2:02:27] We heard that we were not a chicken
[2:02:29] anymore.
[2:02:32] Amen. Come on up. Come up higher. I want
[2:02:34] to show you something.
[2:02:38] I'm going to let you tap into some
[2:02:40] untapped
[2:02:41] resources that's going to give you
[2:02:43] power. That's going to give you victory
[2:02:45] over the devil.
[2:02:48] over the enemy.
[2:02:51] Not just
[2:02:53] victory, not just have to fight for
[2:02:56] it, but victory that has already been
[2:02:59] given to us. Free victory. Amen. Praise
[2:03:03] the Lord.
[2:03:07] Hallelujah. God is good, isn't he?
[2:03:12] Amen.
[2:03:15] We looked and what did we see? First
[2:03:18] thing we saw was that one sat on the
[2:03:22] throne. We ain't got to worry about
[2:03:24] being a trinitarian anymore. Amen. That
[2:03:27] right. Got shown that this trinity, this
[2:03:31] uh trinity of a frog, Amen. came back
[2:03:34] from the Amen. from Catholicis Holy
[2:03:36] Ghost. Always looking back.
[2:03:38] They started way back there. It's not
[2:03:40] three gods. It's one sat on the throne.
[2:03:43] Amen.
[2:03:45] Amen.
[2:03:53] Hallelujah. Then it says verse 11, it
[2:03:56] says, "Amen." They speak and all of
[2:03:58] those four beasts say, "Thou art worthy,
[2:03:59] oh Lord, to receive glory and honor and
[2:04:01] power, for thou has created all things,
[2:04:04] and for thy pleasure they were and are
[2:04:07] created." Chapter 5 says, "And I saw in
[2:04:09] the right hand of of him that sat on the
[2:04:11] throne a book written within on the
[2:04:14] backside." Amen. How many know when we
[2:04:17] come out of that layout of God began to
[2:04:19] open up the book of the revelation of
[2:04:21] the seven seals.
[2:04:26] Amen. The towards the last chap the last
[2:04:29] few verses of chapter 5, it talks about
[2:04:31] John. How did he got amen when whenever
[2:04:34] he saw his name there?
[2:04:36] How do we see our
[2:04:39] names? Because the prophet brought to
[2:04:42] our attention, hey, you realize that
[2:04:44] Revelation 13 says that all wander after
[2:04:47] the beast whose name were not written in
[2:04:50] the book of life from the found of the
[2:04:52] world.
[2:04:54] What would we do? I thought, what would
[2:04:56] you do if you didn't have the invisible
[2:04:58] union of Christ and the bride? kept in
[2:05:01] there. He says she has God has come and
[2:05:04] he has made herself known to her and
[2:05:07] they are one. Amen. He's even given her
[2:05:09] the wedding ring of predestination.
[2:05:12] How many's got on that wedding ring say
[2:05:14] hey you know I believe that I was
[2:05:16] predestinated because why he brought
[2:05:17] another he brought some more. Amen. It's
[2:05:19] called identification.
[2:05:22] How many glad for identification?
[2:05:24] Brother Bam says you got to identify
[2:05:25] yourself with some Bible character.
[2:05:29] Amen. And he says what you do with
[2:05:30] Christ today is what you would have done
[2:05:32] with him then. How do we see our names
[2:05:35] when we are identified with that book
[2:05:37] when we look in here and he says you
[2:05:39] know what I've accepted what God has
[2:05:40] done in this day. So I know that I would
[2:05:43] have been in with him and for him back
[2:05:45] in that day. It identifies who you are.
[2:05:50] How many's glad for that? Thank you Lord
[2:05:52] for identifying. Let me see who I am.
[2:05:56] I believe my name's on the book because
[2:05:57] my identity shows that I am. Amen.
[2:06:02] Praise be to God.
[2:06:04] And not only that, I love this part here
[2:06:08] and it's a sermon in itself. He says he
[2:06:11] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[2:06:14] loud voice. Who is worthy to open the
[2:06:16] book to loose the seals thereof? No man
[2:06:19] in heaven or in the earth or under was
[2:06:21] able to do it? And he wept much because
[2:06:23] nobody was found worthy to open it,
[2:06:26] neither look thereon. And one of the
[2:06:29] elders said unto weep not, behold, the
[2:06:31] lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[2:06:33] prevailed to open the book and loose the
[2:06:38] seals. Amen. And I beheld and lo, Bram
[2:06:42] says, he looked. The angel said, the
[2:06:44] lion has prevailed to open it. Amen. But
[2:06:48] he looked and he said he saw a lamb. How
[2:06:52] many knows? We saw that the the lion the
[2:06:56] lion is the king of the jungle
[2:06:58] representing God. Whenever he roars,
[2:07:01] every beetle and every bug shuts up. How
[2:07:04] many believes we've had the the prophet
[2:07:06] has spoken? The Bible says, "Amen. Who
[2:07:08] can but prophesy? The lion has roared.
[2:07:11] Who can but prophesy?"
[2:07:14] The God's prophet has spoken. Let
[2:07:16] everything, every message, preachure,
[2:07:19] let him say what he's saying. Let him
[2:07:20] stay with the word. Let him stay with
[2:07:22] it. Every man's word is a lie.
[2:07:24] Everybody, everything shuts up except
[2:07:26] for one that and listens come subject to
[2:07:28] that lion.
[2:07:31] And that lion, the king of
[2:07:35] kings, the lord of
[2:07:38] glory, the lion
[2:07:41] became a sheep.
[2:07:45] a sheep. Isn't that
[2:07:48] right? From the most
[2:07:51] ferocious lion of the
[2:07:55] jungle. How many knows they'll attract
[2:07:58] attack a giraffe, a hippopotamus?
[2:08:00] They'll get up on top of him and chew on
[2:08:02] his hard skin. Them guys are
[2:08:05] nuts. Yeah. They don't they don't know
[2:08:08] defeat. They don't know that, you know,
[2:08:11] they could get hurt. They do get hurt.
[2:08:14] They get
[2:08:15] killed. Fearless
[2:08:17] lion. That's right. But this lion became
[2:08:21] a
[2:08:24] lamb. And I truly believe that in the
[2:08:28] breach, I believe it is in the breach,
[2:08:30] brother talked about this lamb, a bloody
[2:08:33] lamb.
[2:08:35] We realize that he was worthy. It's here
[2:08:38] that we find that he was worthy of
[2:08:40] glory, honor, power, strength, that all
[2:08:45] of that, any kind of glory belongs to
[2:08:47] him.
[2:08:49] We saw the true picture of salvation,
[2:08:52] the true picture of what he did and how
[2:08:54] much he loved us.
[2:08:57] Amen. God begins to open it
[2:09:00] up, calls us out. Come out of there.
[2:09:08] Amen. Shows us this
[2:09:11] picture.
[2:09:17] Amen. I to just go down this road for a
[2:09:24] minute. I wrote down
[2:09:28] here,
[2:09:30] "What
[2:09:31] if you didn't believe in Malachi 4?
[2:09:36] Think about it. You'd still
[2:09:39] be stuck in Leadsia.
[2:09:43] In order to be there, you have to
[2:09:44] actually reject Christ. How terrible it
[2:09:48] would be to reject Jesus Christ.
[2:09:51] How many knows that when you introduce
[2:09:52] the message of the hour to people,
[2:09:54] you're actually introducing Jesus Christ
[2:09:56] and what he did this day?
[2:09:59] You really are.
[2:10:01] Amen.
[2:10:05] Because there's no difference between
[2:10:08] Jesus and the message of the hour. No,
[2:10:12] it is Jesus. Brother Bram said this
[2:10:14] message is Christ. It is Christ. Because
[2:10:18] if it wasn't, then it was brother
[2:10:20] Brandham and we're following another
[2:10:21] man.
[2:10:23] But it wasn't brother Brandham. It was
[2:10:24] God speaking through his prophet. Amen.
[2:10:30] Without that, you'd have no message
[2:10:32] called as the eagle sareth her nest.
[2:10:35] We'd still be stuck in a barnyard
[2:10:38] under some man-made
[2:10:40] system. But aren't you glad that you
[2:10:43] heard that great as the eagle seareth
[2:10:45] us?
[2:10:48] Amen. You'd have no choosing of a bride.
[2:10:51] How many knows God is choosing his bride
[2:10:53] and it's not going to be some
[2:10:55] adulteress. There be no invisible union.
[2:10:57] And as I said earlier, you'd have no
[2:10:59] wedding
[2:11:00] ring. You would be not engaged and
[2:11:04] married to Christ. Amen. Praise the
[2:11:07] Lord. Think about this. How many knows
[2:11:09] he talks about in the rising of the sun,
[2:11:12] he talks about how that the church is,
[2:11:14] Amen. focusing perhaps too much on the
[2:11:16] mechanics and not the dynamics.
[2:11:19] I was thinking this because I've got the
[2:11:21] quote here where he talks about and I'm
[2:11:23] not going to read it. I'm just going to
[2:11:24] say it, but he says, you know, what good
[2:11:25] does it do to have, you know, shine the
[2:11:27] hubs and polish the wheels and amen put
[2:11:30] armor all on the tires as we were
[2:11:32] supposed to be and and shine the chrome
[2:11:34] up, you know, and make it all look
[2:11:36] plush, you know, deer skin seat splitter
[2:11:39] bam said all of
[2:11:41] this. Amen. If you don't have any
[2:11:43] dynamics, but I thought, you know what?
[2:11:45] We do have that Cadillac. We do have a
[2:11:48] car with spud studs. We have the gold of
[2:11:50] God. We have the diamonds of God. We
[2:11:53] have the car. We have the mechanics.
[2:11:55] We've got conduct, order, and doctrine.
[2:11:57] The church has been set in order. The
[2:11:59] mechanics are put together. We come half
[2:12:02] an hour early. We come to church the way
[2:12:04] that God said to do. But we've also got
[2:12:06] the dynamics. How many believe you
[2:12:08] wouldn't have dynamic? You wouldn't know
[2:12:10] about the dynamic power of the Holy
[2:12:12] Ghost if you didn't have the message of
[2:12:14] the hour. Praise the Lord. Amen. Be in
[2:12:18] bad shape, wouldn't we? We ain't got to
[2:12:20] have no sputtering. Better Bam says, you
[2:12:22] know, you know, people getting all their
[2:12:24] carbon, their motors are getting
[2:12:26] carboned up because they got too much
[2:12:28] water in their gas, too much man-made
[2:12:30] doctrines into there. That's why it just
[2:12:33] sputters. When you come out here to this
[2:12:35] little hill, that car to get the deacons
[2:12:37] help push you up over the hill cuz the
[2:12:39] motor just doesn't have hardly enough
[2:12:41] power to get up over the
[2:12:43] hill. Hello. But as I've often
[2:12:45] demonstrated, man, we like all 16
[2:12:48] cylinders to fire. Amen. We we get that
[2:12:50] engine going like the Indie 5 and a
[2:12:52] half. Let it be. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:12:54] Whenever we get the church, Amen. Let it
[2:12:56] be like the India 500. Start your
[2:13:00] engines. And guess what, brother Joe?
[2:13:02] They fired him up and it sound like
[2:13:05] thunder. No doubt. I don't watch it and
[2:13:06] see it, but no doubt. But it
[2:13:09] roars. Amen. That's why church whenever
[2:13:11] the power of God is surging it might get
[2:13:14] a little noisy. Amen. People begin to
[2:13:16] roar cuz I'm here to tell you with all
[2:13:18] of God what he has done for us all the
[2:13:20] things that he has done for knowing that
[2:13:22] he is the one that's leading. He is the
[2:13:24] one that's willing to provide. He's
[2:13:26] going to lead us through whatever you
[2:13:27] have need of in the future. He's going
[2:13:28] to lead us through. And we ought to
[2:13:30] bring a praise in our hearts and our
[2:13:32] lives like never before.
[2:13:38] That's right. It ought to it brought a
[2:13:40] praise. Malachi 4 brought a praise, a
[2:13:44] worship. It did in John. Amen. Amen. He
[2:13:47] said, "Man, everything in the earth and
[2:13:50] under the earth, and everybody else
[2:13:51] heard me screaming,
[2:13:55] I can't help but over in the jungles of
[2:13:57] Africa, Brother Troy, no doubt. But go
[2:13:59] over there in some of them meetings. You
[2:14:01] go over there in that anointing under
[2:14:02] the anointing of the eagle. No doubt.
[2:14:04] But them jungles and their people are
[2:14:06] worshiping him." Amen. And those people
[2:14:08] here under the earth, around the earth,
[2:14:10] whether it's in the ocean. Amen. People
[2:14:12] that believe God. Amen. No doubt. Maybe
[2:14:14] in a submarine somewhere, maybe there's
[2:14:16] a message believer that reads something
[2:14:18] and he says, "Woo, glory." Some of them
[2:14:20] people in the depth of the earth are
[2:14:22] going to hear. Amen. The real believers
[2:14:24] worshiping God.
[2:14:28] Amen.
[2:14:30] Praise the Lord. Like that man and the
[2:14:32] old old geyser. Old man. Old man had a
[2:14:36] Amen. He loved the Lord. And his
[2:14:39] granddaughter was a little prissy and
[2:14:40] she was going to have her prissy little
[2:14:41] girls over. She wanted to have a little
[2:14:43] tea party. She said, "Now, papa, I'm
[2:14:46] going to put you up in the attic, okay?
[2:14:47] And I'm going to give you a National
[2:14:49] Geographics book. All right? Cuz don't
[2:14:51] take your Bible up there. We don't want
[2:14:53] to hear a bunch of this out of the
[2:14:54] other." And anyway, he went up there and
[2:14:56] Amen. He got to looking through these
[2:14:58] National Geographics. There they were
[2:15:00] having a little tea party from what I
[2:15:01] understand. Pretty close to the story.
[2:15:03] Ain't that right? And all of a sudden he
[2:15:05] come across there and that there and he
[2:15:06] says you know there's a part of the
[2:15:08] ocean that's so deep that they can't
[2:15:10] even find the
[2:15:13] body. What's going on up in the lake?
[2:15:16] Why? Amen. In the sea of his
[2:15:18] forgetfulness. That's where my sins are.
[2:15:20] They're so far down there. No fishing
[2:15:22] net. A song gone in the sea of God's
[2:15:27] forgetfulness. Hallelujah. Aren't you
[2:15:29] glad that we have got a message? Amen.
[2:15:31] that has brought us and made us the
[2:15:33] bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. This
[2:15:35] message is the clothing that we're going
[2:15:37] to wear when he comes.
[2:15:40] That's how important this message is.
[2:15:42] Invisible union. All of these messages.
[2:15:45] Amen. Let's wear them. Say, "God, let me
[2:15:47] be clothed with him." Amen.
[2:15:50] Praise be to God. God is good, isn't he?
[2:15:55] Hallelujah.
[2:15:56] He sure is. We're glad for what God's
[2:15:58] done in our generation and is doing
[2:16:02] presently in a group of people in you
[2:16:07] and in me.
[2:16:12] Amen. Had the message prophet of God
[2:16:14] preach a message possessing the gates of
[2:16:17] the enemy after a trial.
[2:16:21] Amen. Brother Brandham he said you know
[2:16:23] sometimes we pray for ease. Lord, let me
[2:16:26] have comfort and let me have ease and
[2:16:27] let me have it nice. But he says he'll
[2:16:29] give you the best thing that he could
[2:16:31] possibly give you. That's a trial.
[2:16:36] A test. Ain't that right?
[2:16:40] Amen. I'm here to tell you, eating that
[2:16:42] peach cobbler and that peach pie and all
[2:16:44] of that stuff, you know, that that
[2:16:46] doesn't give you a whole lot of muscle
[2:16:48] and energy. Hello. It may taste sweet
[2:16:51] and be good, but it's those trials. It's
[2:16:53] those hard times that really mold you
[2:16:56] and make you Amen. How many believes
[2:16:58] that? I'm so glad that God has helped us
[2:17:00] and he's teaching us how to walk, how to
[2:17:03] talk, how to act. Amen. And we won't get
[2:17:07] into it. I'll just mention it. But how
[2:17:09] many remembers brother Bam says the gold
[2:17:11] that God is looking for is a Christlike
[2:17:13] character. You came naked into this
[2:17:15] world. Leosia is naked. Is that right?
[2:17:19] And we were naked, but we're not going
[2:17:20] to leave here naked. That's right. Nope.
[2:17:23] God's going to see to it that we have
[2:17:24] got some clothes on and that clothing is
[2:17:27] a Christlike character molded in the
[2:17:30] fiery furnace of affliction.
[2:17:35] Amen. To teach us whether it's going
[2:17:38] good or whether it ain't going good.
[2:17:40] Whether you're in a valley or whether
[2:17:42] you're in a mountain, I praise the Lord
[2:17:44] anyway. Ain't that right? Amen. God
[2:17:47] bless you this morning. Let's stand.
[2:17:48] musicians if you'll
[2:17:53] come. They're
[2:17:55] coming. No rising of the sun. There
[2:17:58] would be no statue of a perfect man.
[2:18:00] There would be no total deliverance.
[2:18:01] You'd still be halfway. I mean, remember
[2:18:03] brother saying that, you know,
[2:18:06] Christians are sometimes halfway.
[2:18:08] Preachers can be halfway, but God don't
[2:18:09] make them that way. It's their own way
[2:18:10] that gets mixed up in it. Amen. So, we
[2:18:13] need a total of deliverance, not just
[2:18:15] halfway. Wouldn't have thirsting for
[2:18:17] life. You wouldn't understand why you'd
[2:18:19] have that thirst and how did every man
[2:18:21] has it. Amen. Ever since the fall and
[2:18:23] that Holy Spirit left Adam, there was
[2:18:25] always that void. But guess what? How
[2:18:26] many knows you can have that thirst
