[8:01] Once

[8:10] by
[8:12] the binding chains of sin.

[14:15] revealed in me?
[14:21] Thanks for that special night
[14:27] when I saw your glorious
[14:31] life.
[14:33] Came face to face with eternal
[14:37] life. And Lord,
[14:41] I thank you.
[14:46] You didn't have to open my eyes.
[14:52] You could have easily
[14:55] passed me by.
[14:58] For the age I was living in was
[15:04] wretched, poor, and blind.
[15:10] And then I heard recognizing

[16:34] as the coming of the Lord, the rapture
[16:41] mystery.
[16:44] [Applause]
[16:46] And I have heard, but now I see

[27:13] Lord Jesus, we come before you. Father,
[27:15] thanking you, Lord, again, Father, to be
[27:16] able to assemble ourselves together in
[27:18] your name. So grateful, Lord Jesus, that
[27:21] you are with us, Lord Jesus. You'll
[27:24] never forsake us and you'll never leave
[27:25] us, Lord, even to the end of the age.
[27:28] Brother Abraham said, "That's the end of
[27:29] the world, Father. You'll never forsake
[27:31] your people." And we're so grateful for
[27:33] that. And we pray, Lord, that you'll
[27:35] just bless, Lord, the service this
[27:37] evening. Help me to get out of the way
[27:38] and that you might use my lips to speak
[27:40] the words that you once spoken, Father.
[27:42] And bless the ears of the hearer and the
[27:44] hearts of the hearers, Lord, they might
[27:46] receive what you have for us tonight,
[27:48] God. And we just pray, Lord Jesus, that
[27:50] you're that would you would be welcome,
[27:53] Lord Jesus. We want to invite you to
[27:54] come for we know that you always come to
[27:56] where you're invited, Father. And so we
[27:59] invite you to come and speak to our
[28:00] hearts tonight, Father, in Jesus
[28:02] Christ's name. Amen.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[28:08] If you will turn your Bibles. And I kind
[28:10] of wanted to uh kind of go on with our
[28:14] thought a little bit on giving honor and
[28:17] glory. That's due to his name. Amen. Is
[28:20] due to his name. Amen. And tonight we
[28:24] want to well,
[28:26] we just want to try to see what the Lord
[28:29] will have. But we want to talk about
[28:31] being worthy. Worthiness. Amen. Talk
[28:33] about worthiness. The title tonight is
[28:36] thou has made us. Thou has made us.
[28:40] Amen. And we'll look at what he what it
[28:41] is that he made us. Amen. We know he
[28:44] created us for one thing, right? We are
[28:46] the creation of God. Amen. But there's
[28:49] so many things that he's made us that we
[28:50] just have to go down the list, so to
[28:52] speak. Revelations, book of Revelations.
[28:55] Amen. In order for really for me to try
[28:58] to comprehend or get a grasp of this, I
[29:00] listen to the message. Amen. The breach.
[29:03] Amen. the breach between the seals and
[29:05] church ages. It was preached and I think
[29:07] that message would be in your seals
[29:10] book. Are we okay? Sound all right? All
[29:13] right. Good. Amen. And of course that is
[29:19] quite it's a wonderful sermon. Amen.
[29:22] Because he talks about Jesus Christ
[29:25] taking that book and that book of
[29:27] redemption. That book is a book of
[29:29] redemption. I mean, and it has he he
[29:32] mentions and I might might I might read
[29:34] a few of the quotes where he talks about
[29:36] it's the abstract title deed that went
[29:38] back to God after Adam forfeited it.
[29:41] Right? And nobody could touch it. Nobody
[29:43] was even worthy to look upon it. That
[29:46] right? But let's just read here in the
[29:48] fifth chapter of Revelations and we'll
[29:50] just read it and start somewhere and
[29:53] stop somewhere. Amen. So, we don't know
[29:56] just where to where we know where to
[29:58] start, but we don't know where to stop.
[30:00] Amen. Revelations 5 and verse one. And I
[30:04] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[30:06] the throne a book written within and on
[30:08] the backside, sealed with seven seals.
[30:11] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[30:13] with a loud voice, who is worthy to open
[30:16] the book, and to loose the seals
[30:18] thereof? And no man in heaven nor in
[30:21] earth, neither under the earth, was able
[30:24] to open the book, neither to look
[30:26] thereon. And I wept much, because no man
[30:29] was found worthy to open the book, to
[30:31] read the book, neither to look on it.
[30:34] And one of the elders said unto me, weep
[30:36] not, behold, the lion of the tribe of
[30:38] Judah, the root of David, has prevailed
[30:40] to open a book, and to loose the seals
[30:43] thereof. Amen. down in verse
[30:47] uh nine. And they sang a new song,
[30:50] saying, Thou art worthy to take the
[30:52] book, and to open the seals thereof, for
[30:56] thou was slain,
[30:58] and has redeemed us to God by thy blood
[31:01] out of every kindred, tongue, and
[31:04] people, and nation, and has made us.
[31:08] Amen. Thou has made us. and has made us
[31:12] unto our God kings and priests
[31:17] and we shall reign on earth. Amen. May
[31:21] God add his blessings through the
[31:22] reading of the word. You can be seated.
[31:26] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[31:32] Talk about worthy.
[31:34] talk about worthy and how that this lamb
[31:37] was worthy because why? Why was the lamb
[31:41] worthy to take it? Let me go back just
[31:43] for a minute. Brother Bannon, when he
[31:44] was preaching this, he goes into great
[31:46] emphasis talking about how that when
[31:48] this proclamation was made for somebody
[31:51] to take this book of redemption. Amen.
[31:53] And this is the this this is the book.
[31:55] Amen. That what he called the book of
[31:58] redemption. In other words, uh brother
[32:01] uh let me see brother Brandham said that
[32:03] John wept. Why? He said some ministers
[32:07] uh some minister had said that you know
[32:09] maybe John wept because he found himself
[32:12] not worthy.
[32:14] And brother Bam says no that's not even
[32:16] anywhere close. There's no question
[32:17] about us being worthy. Amen. And also
[32:21] the angel asked for let a man come
[32:24] forth. There was no man worthy. Isn't
[32:26] that right? But yet it had to be a man
[32:29] because in order uh redemption had to be
[32:32] you know it had to be the closest of
[32:34] kin. Isn't that right? In order to
[32:35] redeem something you had to be related
[32:38] to the person and he had to be the
[32:39] closest of kin and so forth you had to
[32:41] become kin folks. And I think brother
[32:43] Bam said he was the most sublime thought
[32:45] that there was because God changed where
[32:48] he was and who he was. Ain't that right?
[32:51] And he became man. Amen. He became one
[32:55] of us.
[32:57] Amen. He had to become kin folks to us.
[32:59] But there was nobody worthy. Not in
[33:01] heaven, not under the earth. Nowhere in
[33:04] all of creation was anybody found worthy
[33:07] to touch that book or to even look on
[33:10] that book.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:14] Because it was the book of redemption.
[33:16] It had all of our names on it.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Because brother Bam
[33:20] said he knew out of the reason that John
[33:23] was weeping was because he knew that if
[33:25] nobody was felt worthy all of creation
[33:28] it was all lost you and I everything was
[33:31] lost if nobody's worthy to take that
[33:34] boat
[33:36] &gt;&gt; and to open the seals thereof. Amen. And
[33:39] if you'll notice Bam talks about how
[33:41] that after he was open you know after
[33:43] those seals open how did John begin to
[33:46] you know how did he rejoice? How did he
[33:48] worshiped?
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:52] Isn't that right? Saying power and honor
[33:55] and glory, you know, to to to the one
[33:57] that sits upon the throne. Amen. Let me
[34:01] uh go all the way back here and just
[34:02] look at a quote here that I really like.
[34:05] Amen.
[34:08] He says, "Now the first thing that
[34:10] represented that redemption come the
[34:12] lamb that had been slain from the
[34:14] foundation of the world. He took the
[34:17] book glory and opened the book, tore off
[34:20] the seals and sent it down to earth.
[34:24] How many knows we could go way back and
[34:26] talking about brother Brandaman when he
[34:27] was thought he was going to die cuz the
[34:29] angel told him to go out west and so
[34:31] forth. Amen. And and and you know he
[34:34] told him to go out west and that
[34:35] something was going to happen and there
[34:37] was a big boom you know and he thought
[34:39] for sure he was going to pretty much
[34:40] telling his wife and kids I don't know
[34:42] if I'll be back. How many remembers that
[34:44] sus is is the time and and so they went
[34:47] out west and what happened was is that
[34:49] these angels in that right? Amen. Come
[34:52] down. Amen. And people were diving under
[34:54] trucks. Rocks were being cut out of the
[34:56] mountains. And I mean it was quite a
[34:57] quite a event that happened.
[35:00] Amen. And then God told Brother Bam, he
[35:02] says to go back to Jeffersonville
[35:04] because he was going to open up the
[35:05] seven seals and preach the seven seals.
[35:07] Isn't that right? Amen. So, just picking
[35:11] that up. Send it down to earth. Notice
[35:13] he sent it down to earth to the seventh
[35:16] angel to reveal it to his people. There
[35:20] you are. Oh my. He says, "And what
[35:22] happened?" He said, "The screams and the
[35:25] shouts and the hallelujah,
[35:29] the anointed, the power, the glory,
[35:33] amen, and the manifestation." Amen.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; How many believe that there has been as
[35:38] a result of the opening of the seals.
[35:41] Amen. And every time you hear and know
[35:44] and even brother B talking about how
[35:46] that you can identify if your life
[35:47] identifies with this ear that shows you
[35:50] where your name is.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We never understood that before.
[35:54] When did you ever hear out of
[35:56] denomination so forth that your name was
[35:58] put on that lamb's book of life before
[36:00] the foundation of the world? The lamb
[36:03] was slain from the foundation of the
[36:05] world. And if you're identified in that,
[36:07] it shows you who you are. If you truly
[36:10] believe that you're a son and daughter
[36:12] of God, boy, I'll tell you what, you got
[36:13] something to be excited about.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. 4:30 yesterday morning, I think it
[36:20] was, when some of this come to me. Amen.
[36:22] And I thought, you know, listen to the
[36:24] shouting, listen to the worship, listen
[36:26] to the praise. Amen. If John was a type
[36:30] after those seals were open, then how
[36:31] did he realize, hey, you know, this is
[36:34] the worthy. Well, he is worthy. All of
[36:36] creation. Amen. Cry. He is worthy. Thou
[36:39] art worthy.
[36:42] How many believe that's our our cry?
[36:44] Thou art worthy to receive glory and
[36:46] honor and power.
[36:49] Amen.
[36:51] He's worthy of everything he gets. Over
[36:54] in Revelations 19, I've read it many
[36:56] times before. He says his eyes were as a
[36:59] flame of fire and on his head were many
[37:03] crowns.
[37:06] Amen. Many crowns. In other words, how
[37:08] many knows that God has many titles?
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's think about worthiness
[37:15] and let's think about titles. Now, he
[37:17] was the He was He was the lamb that was
[37:19] slain from the foundation of the world.
[37:22] Amen. God has many titles. You have many
[37:25] titles. I have many titles.
[37:29] Amen. I wrote some of the titles down
[37:31] that just I have. First of all, I have
[37:33] the title of son. Is that right? How
[37:36] many knows that God has the title of
[37:39] son? He has the title of father. He has
[37:41] the son of the title of father, son, and
[37:43] holy ghost. In the name of the father,
[37:46] son god. When we talk about him, and
[37:48] we'll talk about him for a minute, but
[37:49] and we're trying to go somewhere. Amen.
[37:51] Because we want to show you, amen,
[37:53] something a little bit deeper here. But
[37:55] as a father son, I have the title of
[37:57] son. I have the title of father.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; How many knows that if you wouldn't want
[38:04] to take the responsibility of a wife,
[38:07] well, I don't want to get married. I
[38:09] don't want responsibility.
[38:11] Well, then guess what? You don't never
[38:13] need to have no illitimate children
[38:14] either.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[38:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. You don't ever have no
[38:19] family either if you're not willing to
[38:21] take the responsibility of it. But you
[38:23] take the responsibility of a of having a
[38:26] wife, take responsibility of amen,
[38:28] having children and what comes with
[38:30] that. And that guess what? You're not
[38:31] going to get to go fishing and hunting
[38:33] near as much.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Right, Willie.
[38:38] Hey, we had more time. We'd do more
[38:40] fishing. We do more hunting. We want to
[38:42] all of these things a little bit more.
[38:44] But what? Guess what? When you got
[38:45] children to raise,
[38:48] we got all these responsibilities.
[38:50] All games to go to.
[38:53] Whatever it is. Amen. But Troy and
[38:55] Robin, they know all about it. They got
[38:56] a quiver full. Go. They're They're right
[38:59] in the thick of it all. Whitty Michelle,
[39:02] they're in the thick of it all. Amen.
[39:04] But John W. Wade, they're in the thick
[39:06] of it all.
[39:08] That's right. Amen. Responsibility. And
[39:11] that automatic. And then you get the
[39:13] title of being a father. Not just a
[39:16] father, but a title of having been a
[39:18] husband.
[39:20] Ain't that right? a title of husband.
[39:22] Amen. It's a title. Amen. Amen. Me, I
[39:27] already got the title of grandpa.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Grandfather. That's right.
[39:34] Amen.
[39:36] Man, Brother John, just a few years ago,
[39:38] we was looking at your kids and so forth
[39:40] and thinking, you know, they were just
[39:42] young yet kind of, man, it won't be
[39:43] long. And now, boom, it seems like we
[39:46] snapped our eyes and here you have a
[39:47] couple of grandchildren ready. goes
[39:49] fast, folks. Amen. Amen. Father,
[39:53] grandfather, pastor. Amen.
[39:57] Amen. How many of Jesus is the dearest
[39:59] friend that we could ever have? If
[40:01] you've got friends, then you have the
[40:02] title of being a friend.
[40:05] I'm a carpenter. I'm title of carpenter.
[40:07] I do masonary work. I can do masonary
[40:10] work. Lay block. That's right. Amen. So,
[40:12] I'm titled a builder. Whatever it might
[40:14] be, different things. That's all I can
[40:15] think of. Amen.
[40:19] old man.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Whatever you want to call
[40:23] me. I keep telling my wife, I said, "I'm
[40:26] an old geyzer." Now,
[40:30] I said, "What's an old geyzer?" We We
[40:32] tried to find out what an old geyser
[40:34] was. He said, "Somebody that's old and
[40:37] kind of setting their ways and you got
[40:38] some old ways of thinking about stuff
[40:41] and so forth." I said, "Yeah, that's
[40:42] about right." But anyway, that's just
[40:45] you. But what about God?
[40:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, he knows that uh you know what
[40:51] uh you know that God has a lot of
[40:53] titles. He has a lot of attributes. He's
[40:57] father. He became the son. He became the
[41:00] lamb.
[41:03] Amen. And in order to get titles, in
[41:07] order to have a title,
[41:09] most of the time you have to um
[41:13] well, let's just say let's just say um
[41:18] let's just use
[41:20] like the Stanley Cup. Is that right?
[41:23] There's cups, there's crowns, there's
[41:26] belts,
[41:28] there's all kinds of things. There's
[41:30] trophies.
[41:32] Isn't that right? All these different
[41:35] things that kind of give them uh g give
[41:37] them
[41:39] give them it gives them a title. In
[41:41] other words, uh in the boxing world,
[41:45] they have like a heavyweight title, a
[41:48] lightweight title, a featherweight
[41:49] title. Amen. Of who's the best boxer.
[41:53] Ain't that right? Before they can have
[41:56] that belt or whatever around them. Ain't
[41:58] that right? And boy, they're proud of
[41:59] that belt.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. When people get their cupton or
[42:02] whatever their trophy is, they run
[42:04] around there with the team. Yeah.
[42:07] Basketball, we're the best that there
[42:09] is. Football, we're the best. They have
[42:12] that that that little gold football, I
[42:15] guess. You know, I don't know that much
[42:16] about it, but you know, they have their
[42:17] trophy and boy, they're proud of that
[42:19] trophy.
[42:21] But what did they have to do? They had
[42:23] to earn it.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; How many believes like respect? How many
[42:27] knows that if people think that they are
[42:29] due some respect?
[42:31] Well, how many knows respect is earned?
[42:36] You earn respect. It's something that's
[42:38] earned it. That's the way it was with
[42:40] God. How many believes he earned it?
[42:44] That's why he's do it is because he've
[42:46] ear he's earned it. He's fought for it.
[42:49] He's done something for it.
[42:52] Why? How many believe that's why we
[42:54] respect God? That's why we honor God
[42:56] because of what he did for you and I.
[43:00] Because you are worthy because thou was
[43:04] slain. In other words, he did something.
[43:08] You went and you went to Calvary. You
[43:10] died to yourself in Garden of
[43:12] Gethsemane. You didn't want your will,
[43:13] but you wanted the father's will.
[43:16] And you suffered like no man has ever
[43:19] suffered.
[43:21] Heartbroke. All of humanity left him.
[43:24] His own disciples left him. Can you
[43:27] imagine his own disciples? Peter and
[43:30] John and all of them.
[43:32] Not one of them stayed there with him.
[43:34] They all fled.
[43:36] God all by himself having to face
[43:40] death by himself.
[43:44] Amen. And so because of what he done is
[43:47] why he's worthy of honor and glory and
[43:52] crown and the crown. Amen.
[43:55] Praise the Lord. Because of what he is.
[44:00] Amen. And we appreciate that.
[44:03] But no matter what the title is, you
[44:05] have to fight for it. Now, in today's
[44:06] world, they want to go through school
[44:08] and and and and get a you they want to
[44:12] pass even though they don't pass.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; They don't want to they don't want to
[44:18] study for it.
[44:20] Everybody wants equal rights.
[44:23] The women, they want to have get as much
[44:26] pay as the men.
[44:29] Isn't that right?
[44:31] Like old Trump says, "Well, let him do
[44:33] as much as man, and we'll pay him as
[44:34] much as man."
[44:42] Oh, that just irritates the fire out of
[44:44] me. You'll watch a YouTube of some woman
[44:46] trying to tackle a guy, some police
[44:47] woman trying to tackle a guy.
[44:50] Huh? Some of them get killed. It's a
[44:52] very stupid thing. Come on, people.
[44:54] Brother Bram says, "Man, they I have no
[44:56] business out there doing a thing." Amen.
[44:59] But what is what I'm I'm trying to say
[45:01] is how many believes that in order to in
[45:04] order to have a little victory,
[45:07] how many wants victory?
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Sure. Then you got to have a battle.
[45:12] Oh my. You can't have a victory without
[45:15] a battle.
[45:18] Amen.
[45:19] Let's look at God for a minute. Look at
[45:21] his titles. First of all, he's God. Why?
[45:26] He has he's he's earned the title of
[45:30] being God. One time he wasn't God. Why?
[45:34] Because he hadn't earned the title yet.
[45:37] There was nothing to worship him. God
[45:39] means object of worship. So what did he
[45:41] do? How many's glad that he spoke angels
[45:45] into existence?
[45:48] That's right. And they're there and they
[45:49] worship him because he was a creator.
[45:53] Amen. So he earned the title
[45:56] of being God. And in order to be a
[45:58] father, guess what? He had to have
[46:00] children, didn't he? You can't be a
[46:03] father unless you have children.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so became a father because he
[46:08] desired a family of his own. How many
[46:10] know every couple sitting here? Amen.
[46:13] Every family with children sitting here,
[46:15] you are a representation of what God had
[46:17] in his mind before the foundation of the
[46:20] world. He wanted to be that daddy that
[46:22] corrects his children, that teaches his
[46:24] children. Amen. The right way to go and
[46:27] that helps them to grow up when they get
[46:29] to be about 18, 19 years old. Amen. They
[46:32] act like their daddy.
[46:36] Amen. They act like their father. things
[46:40] that he taught him. Not rebellious and
[46:42] so forth. No, but to learn to teach him.
[46:47] That's what he is. Amen.
[46:52] We have been predestinated to be
[46:54] conformed to the image of his son.
[46:57] Amen. We should act and think like God.
[47:02] Amen. It's amazing. I was sitting with
[47:05] my wife at somewhere. I think it was
[47:08] watching Emilyn play or something and
[47:10] and I just got to thinking
[47:13] of how much me and my wife think alike.
[47:18] Amen.
[47:23] Um, honey, did you get the eggs? Oh,
[47:25] yeah. I was just thinking about that a
[47:26] minute ago. Am I supposed to go get the
[47:28] eggs? Huh? Have the cows caught water?
[47:31] Oh, yeah. I was thinking we need to give
[47:33] the cows water, you know, or whatever it
[47:36] is. Oh, did you think about that? Or or
[47:38] or we'll be driving down the road in a
[47:40] certain thought and and then man, I was
[47:42] thinking that, too.
[47:44] After living together so long, you you
[47:48] you're in the same atmosphere. Ain't
[47:50] that right? And and you just kind of
[47:53] think on the same wavelength.
[47:55] I mean, believe that's the way it ought
[47:56] to be really. Amen. because you think of
[47:59] things and responsibilities and things
[48:01] that need to be done and your mind is
[48:03] there and so forth. And that's the way
[48:06] it ought to be with God and his wife.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That we ought to think
[48:10] the way he thinks.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. But he was
[48:16] father. He has so many titles. What did
[48:19] he say? He had many crowns. In other
[48:21] words, he had many trophies. He's the
[48:24] victor. He's a mighty conqueror. He's
[48:28] the King of Kings. He's the Lord of
[48:31] Lords. He's the Alpha. He's the Omega.
[48:35] He's the beginning. He's the end. He's
[48:38] the rose of Sharon. And thank God, he's
[48:41] the lily of the valley.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like Sister Becky many times
[48:46] sings. Amen. He's a lily in my valley.
[48:49] When you're going through a Amen. a hard
[48:51] time in a low valley, guess what? He's
[48:53] the one, that little lily that sprouts
[48:55] up and give you a little joy.
[48:58] He's the light of the world.
[49:04] Amen.
[49:07] He's a mighty warrior. Mighty in battle.
[49:10] I mean, believes he's a warrior of all
[49:13] warriors.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; He's a soldier, brother Brian, of all
[49:17] soldiers.
[49:20] He's the undefeated, undisputed
[49:23] champion.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he is.
[49:30] And some of this championship,
[49:33] the way that he's a champion and what
[49:35] God is, he brings down. Amen. And he
[49:39] brings it down onto our level and brings
[49:42] us to be the same thing.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Let's take a little turn right quick.
[49:53] Because all these things that God is,
[49:55] remember all that God is, we are.
[50:00] Isn't that right? We become all that God
[50:04] is.
[50:06] How many believes that God is a
[50:07] deliverer?
[50:10] He's a deliverer.
[50:14] And I really like the story because I
[50:17] want to I want to I want to look at this
[50:19] for a minute but that brother Brandham
[50:21] tells in the breach in the breach and I
[50:24] used it many times preaching
[50:28] and I really like it. I don't know if I
[50:30] can pull the quote up real quick maybe
[50:31] or not but we'll see if it's in here.
[50:38] Amen.
[50:47] All right.
[50:58] Here we are.
[51:00] He says, "Can you imagine someone
[51:02] falling from the earth down into a deep
[51:05] pit somewhere and was struggling and
[51:08] climbing and pulling They must by some
[51:11] means get out of this pit. I thought of
[51:13] it while I was laying on the bed. I
[51:15] thought about being in a pit with
[51:17] snakes, venomous snakes.
[51:20] Isn't that right? Rattlesnakes, cotton
[51:22] mouth, all kinds of snakes. And there
[51:25] you are. And you climb up a few rocks
[51:27] just to get out of their reach. But
[51:29] you're only going to be able to hold on
[51:31] so long. And your energy will run out
[51:34] run out. You'll drop down and you'll get
[51:37] bit by these snakes. Cuz how many knows
[51:38] this life is full of traps, full of
[51:41] deadly, poisonous things in this world,
[51:44] but there they are down in that pit and
[51:47] can't get out.
[51:50] Amen. That's what you That's where you
[51:51] and I were.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it means so much that
[51:57] fifth chapter of Revelation of how what
[51:59] he did, how he was our redeemer, how he
[52:02] was our savior, how he was our
[52:05] deliverer.
[52:07] Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. Climbing, trying to get
[52:13] out.
[52:15] They're not in their original state,
[52:17] frantically
[52:19] screaming. Isn't that what we'd be
[52:21] doing, buddy? We wear our vocal cords
[52:23] out. Help.
[52:26] Help.
[52:29] I'd be going as loud as I could. I'm a
[52:32] little quiet now. I don't want to hurt
[52:34] their ears, but I'd be whistling. I'd do
[52:36] whatever I had to to try to get that
[52:38] sound out there. Somebody get over here
[52:40] and give me some help. Woo! How many
[52:43] glad that somebody heard you? How many
[52:46] glad tonight that somebody heard your
[52:48] cry when you called out? Amen. There was
[52:52] somebody that heard it. Amen. Just like
[52:54] Barn Bland blind Barnabas, he was cried
[52:57] out, "Help me! Help me! Jesus! Jesus!
[53:00] Where are you?"
[53:02] God heard him. Jesus heard him when
[53:04] delivered him. That's the way we are as
[53:06] sinners. God, I don't know what church
[53:09] is right. I don't know. I'm a sinner.
[53:10] How do I get saved? Amen. I can't get
[53:13] out of this, Lord. But you've got to
[53:14] come and help me.
[53:17] Amen. I can't save myself. I can't get
[53:20] out of this.
[53:22] Amen. I don't care where you are. You
[53:25] can't get yourself out. God has to come
[53:27] down and get you out.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[53:32] Screaming. They're clawing the walls,
[53:35] making a noise, or doing some way.
[53:38] They're groaning because they want to
[53:40] get back to their original state. Bible
[53:43] says that the whole creation is
[53:45] groaning. Isn't that right? Amen. And
[53:48] that's why a person that's struck with
[53:50] disease aches and pains. Amen. One time
[53:53] they wasn't that way, but they're
[53:55] groaning. They're not where they're
[53:56] supposed to be. Something's wrong. Amen.
[54:01] That's right. They're not right. There's
[54:02] something wrong. And they're groaning
[54:04] trying to get back to where they were
[54:06] when they were healthy. Amen. And when
[54:09] nature and the peoples and Bible said
[54:11] they're groaning, it shows that there is
[54:13] something. Amen. Not in their ought to
[54:15] be conditioned. They have fallen from
[54:17] somewhere. Amen. And they don't need
[54:20] anybody to interpret that for us. That's
[54:22] right. Cuz we know that what it was that
[54:24] we fell from was eternal life. Brother
[54:27] Van talks about that abstract title
[54:29] needed was that abstract title needed to
[54:31] eternal life
[54:33] went back to the father. Nobody could
[54:36] take of it. But praise be to God because
[54:39] of Calvary. I'm here to tell you that
[54:42] I'll never Oh boy. I didn't say this a
[54:44] while ago. Amen. But brother Brandham,
[54:46] another thing I thought is that Brother
[54:48] Brandham, he said when he went uh when
[54:50] he he's over yonder. He said that in
[54:52] this in the breach. Amen. And I'm way
[54:54] down there in the holler somewhere. You
[54:56] hear me singing Amazing Grace, how sweet
[54:59] the sound. He says, "Oh, brother Benham
[55:01] made it.
[55:03] Oh, brother Benham made it." Ain't that
[55:05] right? Listen. And I thought, you know,
[55:07] because this praise that we have, this
[55:10] thankfulness that we have in our hearts,
[55:12] it's not just for a week or two, a month
[55:15] or two, a year or two. Amen. It's for
[55:19] all eternity.
[55:22] I'll I'll read I'll read the rest of
[55:24] this quote here after a bit. But the in
[55:26] the eternal ages as they roll on, the
[55:29] redeeming lamb of Christ will still be
[55:32] known amongst his people. When the
[55:35] oceans have wept themselves into the
[55:37] desert and sin is heaped so high till it
[55:40] shook the moon out of its socket, the
[55:42] love of God shall still endure. And the
[55:45] Christ that lives tonight will be the
[55:46] same Jesus who he is when he sits on the
[55:49] throne. Oh glory all eternity he will be
[55:52] the same.
[55:54] How many believe that
[55:58] we get to do this for all of eternity?
[56:01] Brother John says we get to do this
[56:03] forever.
[56:06] Aren't you glad that we get to worship
[56:08] him forever? We'll always down through
[56:10] the ceaseless ages of eternity. We'll
[56:13] praise the lamb that was slain. We'll
[56:16] say that he is worthy of honor and power
[56:18] and glory. He is worthy for the yays and
[56:21] the huras and the screams and the sh.
[56:24] He's worthy 10,000 years and we'll just
[56:27] be started. We'll have no dead last days
[56:30] to sing God's praise than when we first
[56:33] begun.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes it's time to
[56:39] start praising the Lord?
[56:40] &gt;&gt; It's time to thank God. Amen. and be a
[56:43] worshshiper of him because he's worthy.
[56:46] Realizing that it's always hinged on
[56:48] Calvary,
[56:50] understanding, Brother Bam said, the
[56:52] whole mystery of God is made known in
[56:54] those seals. I mean, as you and I
[56:57] understand the whole mystery of God, his
[57:00] whole plan of God, I mean, he took his
[57:02] plum back. back. I mean, brother Bam
[57:04] took his plumb back to the very thoughts
[57:05] of God. The back part, he called it, the
[57:08] very back part of God's mind. What he
[57:10] had in his mind when there was no angel,
[57:12] no stardust, no nothing. That way back
[57:15] there, he was thinking some things and I
[57:18] was in his mind when the song says when
[57:21] he was on the cross, I was on his mind.
[57:23] But I want you to understand, I was in
[57:25] his mind long before the cross. Amen.
[57:27] When the cross was in his mind before
[57:29] the foundation, I was there.
[57:34] If you're redeemed tonight, remember
[57:36] brother Ram says we are now redeemed. He
[57:38] just hasn't come and made the
[57:40] possession. Amen. Claim the possession.
[57:43] Claim that redemption possession yet.
[57:46] But we're now redeemed back to God.
[57:50] Amen.
[57:52] All right.
[57:54] Praise the Lord. Now, let's just turn
[57:57] this thing a little bit. We could go on
[57:58] and on. Amen. It's hard to stop.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; How many believes he is the champion? He
[58:07] is I am the Lord the healer.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; He is our healer.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that I didn't have to stay home
[58:15] tonight cuz I was sick.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, are you glad you're over
[58:20] that co?
[58:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord. You feel
[58:25] better, right? Hallelujah. Why? Because
[58:28] he is your healer.
[58:31] He's our savior. He's our deliverer to
[58:33] bring us up out of that pit.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:39] Let me come down here to you a minute.
[58:44] What if you was in that pit? What if you
[58:46] was in that pit? You couldn't get out.
[58:48] You was in there for days. You couldn't
[58:51] Oh, boy. You would You're so thirsty.
[58:53] You're You're passing out literally.
[58:55] Sometimes you just fall almost. Let's
[58:57] take the snakes out. I don't want you
[58:58] falling into the snakes, but you just
[59:00] pass out and you lay on the bottom of
[59:02] that pit. You wake up.
[59:06] I just can't barely get any water. I got
[59:08] to have water. I got to have water. Help
[59:11] me. Somebody help me.
[59:16] He says, "I don't have any strength to
[59:17] yell anymore. Your voice is getting
[59:18] smaller and smaller and smaller."
[59:21] Hello.
[59:23] And all of a sudden,
[59:27] next time you pass out again,
[59:30] next time you look up there,
[59:34] there I am standing over. Hey, are you
[59:38] all right? Are you all right?
[59:40] Help me. It mean
[59:47] &gt;&gt; I said, I seen you down there and I went
[59:49] to hardware up there and I got a rope.
[59:52] Yeah.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; All right.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Here's a rope. And you throw that rope
[59:59] down. Huh? I don't know. Maybe you're so
[1:00:03] weak. I'll have to put you on my back
[1:00:04] and get you out. Huh?
[1:00:08] But I get you up out of there. I give
[1:00:10] you a big old cold glass of water.
[1:00:12] Here's some water.
[1:00:14] Here's some baloney. Maybe we'll have a
[1:00:16] t-bone or something. Let's go bigger
[1:00:17] better than baloney.
[1:00:20] Huh?
[1:00:21] and I give you some drink,
[1:00:24] what would you do?
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; How do you think you would react to me?
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Huh? I tell you what, I wouldn't worship
[1:00:34] you, Brother Glenn, but I'd probably
[1:00:35] want to kiss your feet. Let me just Them
[1:00:37] feet's precious, man. I'm so glad them
[1:00:40] feet come here.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Man, you're the greatest man
[1:00:46] in the world.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; You're so awesome.
[1:00:51] Man, you'd be so honored. You'd be so
[1:00:53] glory. You'd be so Thank you. Thank you.
[1:00:57] Thank you. Thank you. Thank Shut up. No.
[1:01:00] Thank you. I'm going to thank you some
[1:01:02] more. I am thankful that you got me out
[1:01:04] of here. How many know give thanks unto
[1:01:06] the Lord? Give thanks unto the Lord cuz
[1:01:09] he's worthy of thanks and praise. Cuz
[1:01:13] that's what he did to you and I. We were
[1:01:14] in that pit. We couldn't get out. We
[1:01:16] couldn't quit sinning. We couldn't
[1:01:18] overcome death. We couldn't overcome
[1:01:19] that. But he come out there and he
[1:01:21] helped you to overcome.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] How many knows in the Old Testament,
[1:01:34] don't have the thing here,
[1:01:36] but if you come into the presence of God
[1:01:39] into the Holies of Holies, what would
[1:01:41] happen?
[1:01:43] Only Aaron could go there once a year
[1:01:45] and he had to be done everything just
[1:01:46] right. Everything had to be just right
[1:01:48] for you to come there. But not that the
[1:01:51] cross has happened. Now that Jesus has
[1:01:54] that cross, how many knows that that
[1:01:56] veil was put there? Amen. To keep the
[1:01:58] people out. When Jesus died, what
[1:02:01] happened to the veil? It ripped. Amen.
[1:02:05] Said, "Come on." Jesus said, "Come unto
[1:02:07] me all ye who are weary and heavy
[1:02:09] laden."
[1:02:11] Why? Because now that your sins are paid
[1:02:13] for, he makes you worthy.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; God makes you worthy to come into his
[1:02:20] presence.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; We don't feel worthy a lot of times in
[1:02:24] ourselves. There's a lot of things we're
[1:02:25] unworthy about. But one thing we are
[1:02:27] worthy is because of the blood of Jesus
[1:02:29] Christ,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; you tonight become worthy.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] Let us, Paul said, let us come boldly
[1:02:39] before the throne of grace. Ain't that
[1:02:42] right? Why? We can come boldly. Man, you
[1:02:45] better not come disrespectful and this
[1:02:47] that or the other in the Old Testament,
[1:02:48] but now have some boldness. Come ask a
[1:02:51] petition. Ask God for forgiveness. Ask
[1:02:53] God to fill you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:02] Amen.
[1:03:06] Praise the Lord. Let's talk about that
[1:03:09] for a minute. Talk about our worthiness.
[1:03:21] Now,
[1:03:24] we're only worthy
[1:03:26] because he makes us worthy.
[1:03:31] in Sardis chapter 3 of Revelations and
[1:03:33] verse4 thou hast a few names in Sardis
[1:03:37] which have not defiled their garments
[1:03:39] and they shall walk with me in white.
[1:03:41] How many knows in Revelations 19 there
[1:03:43] it talks about that they were given to
[1:03:45] have white robes. They're dressed in the
[1:03:47] white raignment clean and white the
[1:03:50] righteousness of saints here. These are
[1:03:52] going to walk in white for they are
[1:03:57] worthy.
[1:03:58] I might tell you you're worthy. Somebody
[1:04:00] else might tell you worthy and you may
[1:04:01] not be worthy. But when God tells you
[1:04:03] that you're worthy, you're worthy.
[1:04:08] How the devil will tell people that
[1:04:09] you're not worthy to be saved. If you're
[1:04:11] not worthy for forgiveness, you're not
[1:04:13] worthy because you've messed up too many
[1:04:15] times.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you a real good uh uh
[1:04:23] what did I want to call it? Some really
[1:04:25] good advice,
[1:04:27] some good counseling.
[1:04:29] When the devil tells you that you've
[1:04:31] messed up too much, that you're not
[1:04:34] worthy of forgiveness, you just take
[1:04:35] back to the scripture where God said
[1:04:38] that we're to forgive each other 4 times
[1:04:41] a day. And if that's us, how much more
[1:04:44] God is willing to forgive you if you're
[1:04:46] willing to forget for for repent.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; So don't take that off of the devil.
[1:04:51] Don't listen to him.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not worthy. Don't you say that.
[1:04:58] That's the devil's language. God says
[1:04:59] you are worthy. Why? Because when he
[1:05:01] went to the cross, he made everybody
[1:05:03] worthy. Cuz he would have never said
[1:05:06] whosoever will let him come if he hadn't
[1:05:09] got the blood there to make you worthy.
[1:05:12] Amen. Here the these people were worthy.
[1:05:17] Amen.
[1:05:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:27] And
[1:05:28] you know it, let me just read you a
[1:05:32] couple things here.
[1:05:34] Chapter one of Revelations verse 5. And
[1:05:36] from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful
[1:05:38] witness, the first begotten of the dead,
[1:05:40] the prince of the kings of the earth.
[1:05:44] Amen.
[1:05:46] Now,
[1:05:50] I always thought that was the kings that
[1:05:52] are out there now.
[1:05:54] those who rule. I'm sure that he's he he
[1:05:57] he's got his they're like a drop a
[1:05:58] bucket. He raises up who he wants to and
[1:06:00] puts in where he wants to. How many of
[1:06:02] the Bible does say that? But after
[1:06:05] looking at this other scripture, all I
[1:06:08] can tell you is I'm not so sure that he
[1:06:09] was talking about them anymore. Amen.
[1:06:13] He says, "The prince of the kings of the
[1:06:16] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[1:06:19] us from our sins in his own blood and
[1:06:23] hath made us kings and priests."
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Kings and priests unto God and his
[1:06:32] father. To him be glory and dominion
[1:06:35] forever and ever. Now notice chapter
[1:06:37] five after he talked about they sang a
[1:06:40] new song. thou worthy to take the book
[1:06:42] because thou was slain and has redeemed
[1:06:43] us to God by thy blood out of every
[1:06:45] kindred, tongue, and people and nation,
[1:06:47] and has made us unto our God kings and
[1:06:50] priests, and we shall reign on earth.
[1:06:54] How many know better teaching in a
[1:06:55] church age book says, "We are now kings.
[1:06:57] We are now reigning.
[1:07:00] We're reigning over the flesh. We're
[1:07:02] reigning over the world. We're reigning
[1:07:03] over sin."
[1:07:06] Sure, we're now kings. We're rulers.
[1:07:10] How many believes that?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; So are these in because in the spiritual
[1:07:15] kingdom, we're ruling over devils.
[1:07:19] They have to obey us. They're under our
[1:07:20] feet. Not saying we aren't going to be
[1:07:23] there in a millennium and ruling, you
[1:07:25] know, for a thousand real. We will. The
[1:07:27] Bible says we'll rule and reign with him
[1:07:28] for a thousand years.
[1:07:30] But he's made us. How many knows that
[1:07:32] it's about what God makes you?
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Let me bring in this thought now. God
[1:07:37] said that, you know, we know that God is
[1:07:39] the master. He is truly the deliverer.
[1:07:43] Ain't that right? But when he told
[1:07:45] Moses, Moses, I've come down to deliver
[1:07:48] my people, but I'm sending you.
[1:07:52] Amen. That deliverance come down into
[1:07:54] Moses's hand to deliver.
[1:07:58] Just like imparting eternal life. How
[1:08:00] many knows the bride is supposed to
[1:08:02] impart eternal life? But bam, one place
[1:08:04] said that is the greater works is to
[1:08:07] actually impart eternal life to other
[1:08:09] people to go out there and preach the
[1:08:11] gospel and bring people eternal life to
[1:08:14] them. The wife is having children so to
[1:08:17] speak. Is that right?
[1:08:20] Imparting eternal life.
[1:08:23] And so guess what? This great deliverer,
[1:08:27] they could have said Moses deliverer.
[1:08:29] They could have said David was a
[1:08:30] deliverer. And they were, but it was God
[1:08:33] in them that was doing delivering.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:39] Hallelujah. How many know that Jesus
[1:08:42] went to hell, death, and the grave and
[1:08:45] conquered it? He was vic victorious over
[1:08:49] all of that.
[1:08:50] He overcame all of that. But yet he
[1:08:53] says, "To him that overcomemeth will I
[1:08:56] grant to seat with me in my throne, even
[1:08:58] as I overcame." How many believe that
[1:09:00] that same overcoming power is now in
[1:09:02] you, it's now in me?
[1:09:06] One place, brother Bam said that we are
[1:09:08] his victory.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you are when you are overcome
[1:09:12] sin, when you overcome unbelief and
[1:09:15] doubt, you are God's victory.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Living through me and living through
[1:09:20] you.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful thing it is.
[1:09:24] How beautiful it is. How many knows that
[1:09:27] God is joy? God is peace. God is
[1:09:29] patience. God is meekness. And all of
[1:09:32] that is right in you. If God is in
[1:09:34] there,
[1:09:36] remember she is him.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] So he overcome that. And Paul said that
[1:09:44] we are more than conquerors
[1:09:47] through him that loved us. How many
[1:09:49] believes you're a conqueror?
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, we talk about Napoleon. Brother Bam
[1:09:54] said in victory, Napoleon overcome the
[1:09:56] whole world.
[1:09:58] until water low. Isn't that right? He
[1:10:00] was sad because he didn't have nothing
[1:10:02] else to overcome at 33. But he says how
[1:10:05] much greater it was when Jesus at 33
[1:10:07] overcome death, hell, and the grave.
[1:10:10] I mean, how many believes that was an
[1:10:12] eternal victory? He talked about
[1:10:14] Germany's victory. He talked about these
[1:10:16] others victory.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] We have been made victorious.
[1:10:26] I made legs. That's what we've been
[1:10:28] made. Thou hast made us. You have made
[1:10:32] us victorious. You have made us like
[1:10:35] yourself.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; It's what God has made us.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for what God made
[1:10:43] you?
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; It's what he does in your life that
[1:10:47] matters. I wanted to pull it up and I
[1:10:49] didn't know which words to really find
[1:10:52] to try to pull it up,
[1:10:54] but you'll maybe remember it where
[1:10:56] brother talked about this one man and
[1:10:58] I'm thinking it was I don't know if it
[1:11:01] was a fiddle or or just what it was that
[1:11:03] this man played but he was really really
[1:11:05] good and he went into this great
[1:11:07] auditorium. Ain't that right? Thousands
[1:11:10] upon thousands of people came to hear
[1:11:12] him. Isn't that right? And there he was
[1:11:14] just a playing and just everybody was in
[1:11:17] awe. And at the end of it, for some
[1:11:20] reason, this boy kept looking up in the
[1:11:22] balcony. Kept looking up in the balcony
[1:11:25] and kept looking up in the balcony. And
[1:11:27] at the end of it, they all stood up and
[1:11:29] roared.
[1:11:31] And he was just quiet and looked at his
[1:11:33] master. And the master nodded.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; That's what he was looking for.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Did he make the master happy? Amen.
[1:11:43] Amen. God gives you the victory
[1:11:46] shouting. But guess what? It's not
[1:11:47] something that you take glory on
[1:11:49] yourself that you're worthy, but it's
[1:11:51] him that made you.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; He We look to him say, "God, is this
[1:11:54] pleasing to you?"
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I'll tell you what, when
[1:12:00] people try to take honor and glory to
[1:12:01] themselves, God is not very pleased with
[1:12:03] that. We have nothing to boast about.
[1:12:06] Amen. Except our boast is in Jesus
[1:12:08] Christ.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] Everything that we are, all that I am
[1:12:14] here, all that you are tonight is
[1:12:17] because of what God has m made you.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with a story. Is that
[1:12:22] all right?
[1:12:26] Amen.
[1:12:28] Remember,
[1:12:30] God specializes.
[1:12:33] God specializes
[1:12:35] in taking things that's nothing and
[1:12:38] making something out of them.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he'll take things that are
[1:12:41] something and make nothing out of them.
[1:12:46] You know, some of these movie stars, you
[1:12:48] hear them committing suicide, dying in
[1:12:50] their house, no friends,
[1:12:53] all kinds of money in the world, but
[1:12:54] they die really sad. Some of them do.
[1:12:58] I hope I never die like that. I want to
[1:13:00] die with a smile on my face
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; if I die.
[1:13:06] Let's just not plan on dying about it.
[1:13:09] But if I was to, smile on my face, my
[1:13:12] family and friends, and comfort and
[1:13:14] peace in my heart. Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Then let's look at what God made the man
[1:13:27] David,
[1:13:29] the least in his family, the littlest
[1:13:32] guy, little scrawy little fella. Ain't
[1:13:35] that right?
[1:13:39] But he had something that was of great
[1:13:42] value that God saw in here. How many
[1:13:44] believe that's what's important?
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Just what's in here?
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; What's on the inside?
[1:13:56] And I think it was
[1:13:58] David that wanted to build the house.
[1:14:01] That right? God says, "No, you can't."
[1:14:04] This is where I think I'm going to try
[1:14:06] to pick up my story.
[1:14:11] showing the consecration of David to the
[1:14:14] love of God and then to see the same
[1:14:16] night how knowing that he was in error
[1:14:18] that he was not permitted to do it. God
[1:14:20] was graceful enough to come down to
[1:14:22] speak to Nathan. And I always like those
[1:14:24] words. Go tell David, Nathan, my
[1:14:27] servant, that I took him from the
[1:14:28] sheep's coat. He wasn't nothing. Amen.
[1:14:34] Nothing. Down in a hole. I believe he
[1:14:36] said that about Israel. I found you in a
[1:14:38] wilderness bleeding and so forth. Ain't
[1:14:41] that right? So to speak, how many knows
[1:14:43] that's where we were when God found us?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:14:48] People
[1:14:50] that are ready to jump off a bridge, put
[1:14:53] a gun to their head, that's a good place
[1:14:56] for God to begin to deal with them.
[1:14:59] They come to the end of their yourself.
[1:15:02] I can't run this thing.
[1:15:04] I haven't, you know, I'm a complete
[1:15:06] failure in running this thing.
[1:15:09] Amen. Then give their heart to God. I
[1:15:12] had to go. I came to that place,
[1:15:14] Pinecraft, Sarasota. Lord, and I wasn't
[1:15:17] about to put a gun to my head. No, I
[1:15:19] wouldn't commit suicide. But I had come
[1:15:21] to the place, Lord Jesus, I don't care
[1:15:23] what it is. I give you my heart, my
[1:15:25] life, my everything. Lord, how many
[1:15:27] believes that's the kind of sacrifice
[1:15:29] God's looking for?
[1:15:35] You wasn't nothing.
[1:15:37] Amen.
[1:15:39] And what did he say? And I've given you
[1:15:41] a name like the great men of the earth.
[1:15:46] Amen.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[1:15:50] Noah. How many Abrahams? We don't have a
[1:15:54] lot of people calling their children
[1:15:55] Abraham anymore. Got a few Noah.
[1:15:59] Peter.
[1:16:00] Isn't that right? Andrew.
[1:16:03] Few Thomases.
[1:16:06] John's. Bunch of John's.
[1:16:09] Huh. Those
[1:16:11] men, they were great men. Ain't that
[1:16:13] right? And we name our children after
[1:16:14] those disciples and so forth. Great men.
[1:16:17] But God said, "David, I've made you a
[1:16:19] great name. Took you from the sheep
[1:16:20] coat.
[1:16:22] Look what I've done."
[1:16:25] Amen.
[1:16:26] Brother Bam says, "And I'd like that to
[1:16:28] apply that for just a minute. I took you
[1:16:31] from nothing and I gave you a name.
[1:16:34] You've got a name like the great men of
[1:16:36] the earth." No, I'd like to play that in
[1:16:37] a confidential
[1:16:40] a way of making a point and he was
[1:16:42] talking about himself.
[1:16:46] I was thinking a few years ago I was
[1:16:48] standing down here in the city and
[1:16:50] nobody cared for me. Nobody loved me. I
[1:16:52] loved people but nobody loved me because
[1:16:54] of the background of my family. No
[1:16:56] disregard to my mama my my mom and my
[1:16:59] father. How I wish mama could have lived
[1:17:01] to see this sanctuary this morning.
[1:17:06] Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know about you, but I think
[1:17:08] the tabernacle is pretty humble.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; I'd say this place is a lot nicer than
[1:17:14] that.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:17:17] But yet, at the time, Brother Brandham
[1:17:19] treasured it. You know why? Because when
[1:17:21] he was younger, that place was a pond
[1:17:24] and he would be skating on it and people
[1:17:26] would be making fun of him and make, you
[1:17:28] know, from school and everything, they
[1:17:29] made fun of him. He was the offcar. He
[1:17:32] said, and I don't know if he'll say it
[1:17:34] or not, but anyway, because of what God
[1:17:38] had did, I don't care what it is, if
[1:17:40] it's humble looking or not, it's it's a
[1:17:42] great thing. Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; All right. He loved people. He go there
[1:17:49] and
[1:17:52] let me see.
[1:17:57] What did I miss?
[1:17:59] Oh,
[1:18:02] I wish mama could come down and see this
[1:18:04] sanctuary this morning. Many of the old
[1:18:06] times who placed their money to help
[1:18:08] build it. Maybe God let him look over
[1:18:10] the banister.
[1:18:12] And I've got a few different quotes
[1:18:13] because I was trying to get couple of
[1:18:16] different stories. Sometimes he
[1:18:17] mentioned the story, sometimes he
[1:18:18] didn't. But the Brandon family didn't
[1:18:20] have a very good name around on the
[1:18:22] count of drinking. Nobody had nothing to
[1:18:23] do with me. I remember telling my wife
[1:18:26] not long ago, I couldn't get anybody to
[1:18:27] talk to me. Nobody cared about me. Amen.
[1:18:31] Now I have to hide to get a little rest.
[1:18:34] He had no friends. When he got downtown,
[1:18:37] what they do? They talk to him talk a
[1:18:39] little bit, but as soon as anybody else
[1:18:41] would come, they would, he said they
[1:18:42] would go talking to him and just ignore
[1:18:44] him completely. He didn't even there
[1:18:46] anymore.
[1:18:48] Huh? Or they wouldn't even acknowledge
[1:18:51] him.
[1:18:54] Amen.
[1:18:55] Now the Lord has given us great place in
[1:18:57] these great things that he has done.
[1:19:00] Amen. And given me besides a bad name,
[1:19:03] he gave me a name liken unto great men.
[1:19:06] And he's cut off my enemies wherever I
[1:19:08] have went. Amen. How many thankful
[1:19:11] you're sitting here? That means God
[1:19:13] probably cut your enemies off. How many
[1:19:16] believes that?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; The same application that Brother
[1:19:19] Brandham, I want to try to bring that
[1:19:20] into this atmosphere here this this
[1:19:22] evening. How many believes that
[1:19:26] we were nothing when God found us?
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; We're still nothing but by the grace of
[1:19:30] God.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] How did I ever know as a little ragged
[1:19:37] kid up here two, three blocks from here
[1:19:38] from Ingville School when I was la the
[1:19:41] laughingtock of the school being so
[1:19:43] ragged and skate on an old pond. How did
[1:19:46] I ever know that down beneath that pond
[1:19:47] laid a seed of a lily that could bloom
[1:19:49] like this? And how did I ever know that?
[1:19:52] No one talking to me. And yet he gave me
[1:19:54] a name that would be honored amongst his
[1:19:57] people.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; How many believes William Brandham?
[1:20:02] That's an honored name.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; That's an honored name.
[1:20:09] That's exactly right.
[1:20:12] I pity people that dishonor it,
[1:20:16] that cringe or hate when you mention
[1:20:20] Brother Brandham.
[1:20:22] I hate where you're going to spend
[1:20:24] eternity
[1:20:26] cuz when he comes with millions and
[1:20:28] millions of the converts,
[1:20:30] hello.
[1:20:34] Where is those people going to be? All
[1:20:36] that you ever loved and that loved you
[1:20:37] will be there.
[1:20:40] Not those that hate you
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; and dislike you.
[1:20:45] Oh boy. I hope somebody out there hears
[1:20:48] this that didn't like him. You You're in
[1:20:50] a great danger. I I'd hate to be where
[1:20:53] you were. I'm scared for you.
[1:20:56] I'm worried for your soul because you're
[1:20:59] dead wrong
[1:21:01] and will be eternally wrong.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Repent
[1:21:07] if you can.
[1:21:12] All right. And as a little old kid
[1:21:14] sitting there, even no shirt on, my coat
[1:21:16] pinned like this with a safety pin, real
[1:21:19] hot. Teacher said, "William, aren't you
[1:21:21] a little hot with that coat on?" "No,
[1:21:23] ma'am, just a little bit chilly." And
[1:21:25] she made me go over to the stove and put
[1:21:27] some wood in there. And I liked burned
[1:21:30] up.
[1:21:32] I didn't have no shirt the whole season
[1:21:34] through.
[1:21:36] no shirt a whole season through.
[1:21:40] And I thought if I could ever get money
[1:21:42] sometime, I'd get a little old 3030
[1:21:44] rifle and I'd come out west and live out
[1:21:47] here and hunt the rest of my life. I
[1:21:49] don't want nothing to do with people.
[1:21:51] Just stay away. They don't love me. But
[1:21:53] because they didn't like me, not just
[1:21:55] stay away from them. Amen. Then he goes
[1:21:58] talk about every time I go downtown,
[1:22:00] they talk to me until somebody else come
[1:22:02] along. But now I said to my wife not
[1:22:04] long ago, my wall is plastered with the
[1:22:07] best guns that can be bought.
[1:22:10] Oh, and I think of the old dirty
[1:22:12] clothes. Tonight I got two or three good
[1:22:14] suits. And no, friends, I have to hide
[1:22:17] in the wilderness just to keep away from
[1:22:19] people. What's the matter? Is it my
[1:22:21] personality? Is it because of education?
[1:22:23] No. It was God rich in mercy.
[1:22:28] Everybody think of where the Lord has
[1:22:30] brought you from where you are today.
[1:22:33] And remember, it's not your personality.
[1:22:36] It's not what you did. It's what the
[1:22:39] grace of God was to you.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand. Say,
[1:22:43] "Thank you, Lord Jesus."
[1:22:45] Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:50] [Applause]
[1:22:51] It was not my education. No. God rich in
[1:22:53] his mercy saw me in that condition and
[1:22:57] he saved me. Amen.
[1:23:01] All that I am, all that I could ever
[1:23:05] hope to be. I have derived from the
[1:23:09] grace and mercy. I was wretched,
[1:23:12] miserable, poor, and blind. But by
[1:23:15] grace, he healed me. I am strong and
[1:23:18] healthy by the grace of God. I have good
[1:23:20] eyesight. I have eat. I have drink. And
[1:23:22] whatever I have need of, he never s
[1:23:25] promised to supply my wants, but my
[1:23:28] needs. How many we would say, I have
[1:23:30] derived from his grace. Stand with me. I
[1:23:34] have derived from his grace. We are what
[1:23:38] we are this evening. This church is the
[1:23:41] grace of God.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; This congregation is the grace of God.
[1:23:46] You're looking at the grace of God. What
[1:23:48] the grace of God can do. I'm looking at
[1:23:51] what the grace can do, the mercy of God,
[1:23:55] the goodness of God, what he did for us
[1:23:57] on Calvary. How many appreciates what he
[1:24:00] did for us on Calvary? Thank you, Jesus.
[1:24:04] Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:09] Amen. God bless you richly. Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:24] Bless him back.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Something about his heart, maybe.
[1:24:38] Okay. Well, let's pray that they'll find
[1:24:40] what it is, right? Find what it is.
[1:24:43] Amen.
[1:24:50] Yes. Yes. Thank you. That was about
[1:24:52] Aaron right there. Amen. Let's pray.
[1:24:56] Each and every one of us, let's ask God
[1:24:59] to touch his soul.
[1:25:02] Get him back in fellowship with him and
[1:25:05] for his body. Lord Jesus, we come before
[1:25:08] you tonight, Lord, with our brother
[1:25:10] Aaron. Lord, we watched that boy grow up
[1:25:12] from a little child. Lord Jesus, we
[1:25:15] claim him as one of yours, Lord. And we
[1:25:18] ask, God, that you would take, Father,
[1:25:21] your Holy Spirit and go to where he is
[1:25:23] now. Lord, bring conviction upon his
[1:25:26] heart. Bring conviction upon his soul.
[1:25:28] Father, he needs to be picked up out of
[1:25:30] this big hole, this pit that he's in.
[1:25:32] Lord, Father, we know that only you can
[1:25:35] do it, but we've got a whole band of
[1:25:37] believers asking and praying for him,
[1:25:39] saying, "Lord Jesus, touch him, Lord
[1:25:41] Jesus. We can't pick him up. We can't do
[1:25:43] it, Lord. Many of us have tried, Lord.
[1:25:45] Did everything we know what to do, Lord.
[1:25:48] We ask God that your mercy and your
[1:25:50] grace, Lord Jesus, would be extended to
[1:25:52] Aaron, Lord, and that he would also
[1:25:54] understand. Amen. And know what it is to
[1:25:57] be redeemed and what it is to have the
[1:25:59] grace of God change your whole being.
[1:26:02] Lord, we don't know just why he's so
[1:26:04] young and why he would have these
[1:26:05] problems, Lord, but we know that you
[1:26:07] know all about it. We ask God that it
[1:26:09] would be working for your honor and for
[1:26:11] your glory and for his embedment Lord.
[1:26:14] We do ask for mercy for him Lord Jesus
[1:26:16] and for his body. But most of all we
[1:26:18] care about his soul Lord Jesus that he
[1:26:20] would be right with you father. So we
[1:26:23] ask God have your divine grace father go
[1:26:25] and meet him father in that hospital
[1:26:27] just now. Father be merciful Lord Jesus
[1:26:30] as you have been to us father. We ask
[1:26:32] for mercy for him in Jesus name.
[1:26:35] Amen and amen. God bless you.
