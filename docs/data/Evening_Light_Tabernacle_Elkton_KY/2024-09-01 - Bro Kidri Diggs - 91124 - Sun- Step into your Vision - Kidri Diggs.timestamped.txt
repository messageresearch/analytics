[1:00:23] turn to Genesis chapter 24
[1:00:27] and then from there we're going to go to
[1:00:30] I think I want Romans chapter
[1:00:42] 4
[1:00:44] Genesis chapter 24
[1:00:59] let's start reading that
[1:01:02] um let's start at verse
[1:01:09] seven and ab and the
[1:01:12] Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my
[1:01:17] father's house and from the land of my
[1:01:20] Kindred and which spake unto me and that
[1:01:25] swear unto me me saying unto thy seed
[1:01:28] will I give this land he shall send his
[1:01:33] angels before thee and thou shalt take a
[1:01:36] wife unto my son from then and if the
[1:01:41] woman will not be willing to follow thee
[1:01:45] then thou shal be clear from this oath
[1:01:49] only bring not my son there
[1:01:51] again and the servant put his hand upon
[1:01:55] the of Abraham his master and swear to
[1:01:58] him concerning that
[1:02:01] matter and the servant took 10
[1:02:05] camels and the servant took 10 camels of
[1:02:08] the camels of his master and departed
[1:02:11] for all the goods of his master were in
[1:02:14] his hand and he arose and went to
[1:02:19] Mesopotamia unto the city of Norah and
[1:02:22] he made his camels to kneel down without
[1:02:25] the seity by The Well of water at the
[1:02:28] time of the evening even the time that
[1:02:31] the woman go to draw water let's go to
[1:02:34] Romans chapter
[1:02:38] 4 Romans chapter
[1:02:45] 4 verse
[1:02:50] 17 as it is written I have made thee a
[1:02:54] father of many nations
[1:02:56] before them whom he believe even God who
[1:03:00] quickeneth the dead and calleth those
[1:03:03] things which be not as though they were
[1:03:07] amen may the Lord a bless reading of his
[1:03:09] word you can have your seat this
[1:03:16] morning and praise God today by the help
[1:03:19] of the Lord I hope you're expecting to
[1:03:21] hear from God Amen by God's grace today
[1:03:25] I want to use for a subject step into
[1:03:28] your
[1:03:29] vision step into your vision amen now we
[1:03:33] know uh based upon what we believe and
[1:03:37] what we follow 90% of the prophet's
[1:03:40] Ministry he walked by Vision amen you
[1:03:43] know a lot of times God had already
[1:03:45] showed him things and all he had to do
[1:03:48] was learn how to let God let everything
[1:03:51] fall in place amen and you know as as I
[1:03:54] look in the scripture right here
[1:03:56] I kind of want to deal with this story
[1:03:58] between Abraham and elizer and we know
[1:04:01] that Abraham was the father of Faith
[1:04:04] amen and that God gave him a promise God
[1:04:07] promised him that your seed will be like
[1:04:09] the stars it'll be like the sand you
[1:04:12] know Abraham your seed is going to be
[1:04:14] great but in that moment you know when
[1:04:17] God gave Abraham that promise Abraham
[1:04:20] was childless Hallelujah you know and he
[1:04:24] per se you know in his own way of
[1:04:26] thinking he couldn't see that coming to
[1:04:29] pass you know why because he was
[1:04:31] thinking as a mortal Man With God all
[1:04:34] things are
[1:04:36] possible it don't matter what it look
[1:04:38] like it don't matter what the doctor say
[1:04:40] it don't matter how much money you got
[1:04:42] in the bank if it's God's will it will
[1:04:44] come to pass and you know uh uh Abraham
[1:04:48] you know God gave him that thought God
[1:04:50] gave him that promise and what I want
[1:04:52] you to realize is Abraham didn't ask God
[1:04:55] for any children Hallelujah he didn't
[1:04:58] ask God for this God made this promise
[1:05:01] Hallelujah God gave this to him
[1:05:04] unconditionally amen so I want you to
[1:05:07] understand that there are Promises of
[1:05:09] God that God gives unto us that we
[1:05:12] didn't even ask for Hallelujah so it's
[1:05:14] not up to us to make these things come
[1:05:17] to pass but all we have to do is believe
[1:05:20] in God hallelujah it's not youh uh and
[1:05:24] your own marriage or your Own Strength
[1:05:26] no it's just us believing in God
[1:05:29] hallelujah you know I like what he told
[1:05:31] the prophet he said if you could just
[1:05:33] get the people to
[1:05:35] believe Hallelujah if you could just get
[1:05:38] the people to believe nothing will be
[1:05:40] able to stand before you nothing not
[1:05:43] even cancer amen now I'm a witness to
[1:05:46] that amen that not even cancer be able
[1:05:49] to stand in front of the believer
[1:05:52] Hallelujah cuz you know um um at a very
[1:05:56] young age in my life and I'm sure some
[1:05:58] of you heard the testimony but I just
[1:06:00] want to reflect for a second if you
[1:06:02] don't mind you know at a very young age
[1:06:05] in my life by 15 years old I had cancer
[1:06:08] in my brain Hallelujah and you know God
[1:06:11] is so good because those of you who
[1:06:13] don't know me you would have never known
[1:06:15] that if I wouldn't have told
[1:06:18] you
[1:06:20] hallelujah hallelujah so that just shows
[1:06:23] how great God is and and when he does
[1:06:26] something he does it completely amen and
[1:06:29] you know doctors told me you know uh I
[1:06:33] I'm not going to go through the whole
[1:06:34] testimony but you know doctors told me
[1:06:36] I'd be a vegetable they told me you know
[1:06:39] I I'd be this I I lose this and I lose
[1:06:42] that and all these things you know in
[1:06:44] the natural realm but my mom had a
[1:06:47] vision
[1:06:48] hallelujah amen and per se I'm not
[1:06:51] necessarily saying seeing a vision but
[1:06:54] believing in what God can do and her
[1:06:58] vision was Hallelujah if we can receive
[1:07:01] this by faith Hallelujah my son can be
[1:07:04] made whole amen all I got to do is get
[1:07:07] him to believe like I
[1:07:10] believe
[1:07:12] Hallelujah
[1:07:15] Glory Church her job was not to do it
[1:07:19] herself but to get me to come on board
[1:07:22] with what she belied and if I could come
[1:07:25] on board B with what she believed
[1:07:27] Hallelujah I could get my healing Glory
[1:07:30] because she was already believing that
[1:07:33] by his stripes I'm already healed see
[1:07:36] she was stepping into the vision of my
[1:07:39] life Hallelujah and you may not you may
[1:07:42] you you you may not understand that
[1:07:43] right now what's taking place right now
[1:07:46] in this church on this Sunday morning is
[1:07:49] a vision of God that was seen Hallelujah
[1:07:52] on the back side of his mind see
[1:07:55] everyone in this room God already
[1:07:58] pre-ordained to be here hallelujah
[1:08:01] though those who are listening by by by
[1:08:03] streaming or whatever it is God already
[1:08:05] saw you sitting down watching it
[1:08:08] Hallelujah so Church even right now
[1:08:10] we're living by
[1:08:12] Vision but you know uh my mom she came
[1:08:15] to me and she told me in that hospital
[1:08:18] room son you don't have to accept
[1:08:23] this you don't have to accept this
[1:08:26] see she's speaking into my life and you
[1:08:29] know what at that moment I didn't know
[1:08:31] what a prophet was I didn't I didn't
[1:08:33] understand who Jesus Christ is or who
[1:08:36] Jesus Christ was or who Jesus Christ
[1:08:39] will be Hallelujah but all she's trying
[1:08:41] to do is pull me on board hallelujah
[1:08:45] what she's trying to get me to do to see
[1:08:48] those things that are not as though they
[1:08:51] are see church that's given to Abraham's
[1:08:54] seed no matter what it looks like amen
[1:08:57] if you could just if you could just

[1:09:02] God hallelujah is unstoppable my God
[1:09:05] hallelujah is is nothing with him is
[1:09:08] impossible amen my God can do all things
[1:09:13] if you would just come aboard with me

[1:09:18] can be answered right here in the
[1:09:21] service oh my I feel the holy ghost
[1:09:23] moving amen but I but I but need some
[1:09:25] help from you this morning Hallelujah
[1:09:28] Church there's something that God has
[1:09:30] given us that that that'll make us draw
[1:09:33] God closer and it's very simple four
[1:09:37] little
[1:09:42] words this word right here will bring
[1:09:45] God on the
[1:09:47] scene this word right here will answer
[1:09:50] prayer this word right here will heal
[1:09:53] your body amen this word means so be it
[1:09:57] God hallelujah I agree with the word
[1:10:00] amen and if I could just get you to come
[1:10:03] along with me we'll experience some
[1:10:05] Supernatural things this morning
[1:10:08] hallelujah how often do we hear the word
[1:10:10] and we agree but we never tell God I
[1:10:14] agree Hallelujah let your confession
[1:10:18] Hallelujah be a word let your confession
[1:10:22] amen turn into from just a nod to to
[1:10:25] spoken word
[1:10:28] Authority ain't no power in nodding but
[1:10:32] there's power when we speak amen and
[1:10:35] this little word right here gave Harry
[1:10:37] right her
[1:10:40] children Prophet just sitting there
[1:10:42] preaching and everybody sitting around
[1:10:45] him listening and Har right said you
[1:10:48] know what that ain't nothing but the
[1:10:50] truth you know what she was saying do
[1:10:52] you know what she was saying she was
[1:10:54] saying
[1:10:55] somebody tell me what she was saying
[1:10:58] somebody tell me what she was saying she
[1:11:01] was saying amen and you know what she
[1:11:04] wasn't even
[1:11:06] there Hallelujah she wasn't even there
[1:11:10] when the when when the prophet got the
[1:11:11] Silver Tip she wasn't even there
[1:11:14] Hallelujah when he spoke to the storm
[1:11:16] she wasn't even there when he was in the
[1:11:18] boat with the with the white brothers
[1:11:19] Hallelujah she was even there when he
[1:11:22] got the Caribou but there was something
[1:11:24] in her spirit that could say
[1:11:28] Amen there was something in the spirit
[1:11:31] that could say
[1:11:32] Amen so be it to my God my God is able
[1:11:37] Hallelujah is there anything in your
[1:11:39] spirit that can agree with the word of
[1:11:40] God hallelujah this is our power amen
[1:11:45] our power is when we become one with the
[1:11:48] word and you can't just get there by
[1:11:51] being
[1:11:52] intellectual no you have to make a step
[1:11:56] you have to step into the vision amen
[1:11:59] but you know Hallelujah her job she felt
[1:12:02] like was just to express Jesus Christ to
[1:12:05] me and get me to accept what she
[1:12:07] believed Hallelujah and mind you I
[1:12:10] didn't grow up in a message
[1:12:12] home but God made it that way Hallelujah
[1:12:16] and you know when my mom got she came
[1:12:18] into the message and and rededicated her
[1:12:21] life and different things cuz she grew
[1:12:22] up Pentecostal but she accept this
[1:12:26] word and it was by this word hallelujah
[1:12:29] she was going to meet one of the
[1:12:30] greatest challenges in her life
[1:12:32] Hallelujah watching her son come through
[1:12:34] cancer in his brain but you know she had
[1:12:38] to live by
[1:12:40] Vision she couldn't live in the moment
[1:12:43] Hallelujah she had to believe for those
[1:12:45] things Hallelujah that her eyes couldn't
[1:12:48] see in his present moment she had to
[1:12:50] believe in those things that her heart
[1:12:53] was yearning to see God do amen
[1:12:55] and you and I today we have to believe
[1:12:57] in the Unseen things Hallelujah not the
[1:13:01] things that may be per se right in our
[1:13:03] eyes and you know Church anyway to make
[1:13:06] the story short you know uh she begin to
[1:13:09] tell me that God's A Healer Divine
[1:13:11] healer and before the foundation of the
[1:13:13] world we got Isaiah

[1:13:40] hard battles but God has been good to me
[1:13:43] and you know what now I look at the
[1:13:45] battles I've gone through as God making
[1:13:47] me who I am I look at my battles as God
[1:13:51] hallelujah producing and forming
[1:13:54] character amen
[1:13:55] that's why the prophet would come and
[1:13:56] say character is not a gift it's a
[1:13:59] victory amen when you go through things
[1:14:02] and your feet are still planted on the
[1:14:04] Gospel of Jesus Christ that's a victory
[1:14:07] amen because there are some people will
[1:14:10] go through what you go through and go
[1:14:12] back in the world but God put something
[1:14:14] in you to stand your
[1:14:16] ground Hallelujah to let the devil fight
[1:14:20] and you fight back amen GL but you know
[1:14:24] uh when came to she the doctors came in
[1:14:27] and they started to tell me about
[1:14:29] chemotherapy now keep in mind I did have
[1:14:32] a surgery they operated and they took
[1:14:34] the the cancer that was in my brain out
[1:14:37] if if I was to kneel down right here I
[1:14:40] had 27 staplers in my head when they did
[1:14:44] the surgery but once they did the
[1:14:46] surgery they told me the cancer is
[1:14:48] spreading in your
[1:14:50] body and I'm like whatever what does
[1:14:54] that mean
[1:14:55] Hallelujah 15 years old I I I don't I

[1:15:03] uh the cast is spreading and different
[1:15:06] things are going to happen and uh uh you
[1:15:08] must take chemo and radiation treatment
[1:15:11] so I'm like okay so they begin to
[1:15:13] explain to me chemo and radiation how
[1:15:16] many know that this message already
[1:15:19] explained
[1:15:22] it Hallelujah the prophet of God
[1:15:26] hallelujah in different messages he has
[1:15:28] a message called what is cancer
[1:15:30] Hallelujah and he begins to break it
[1:15:32] down see if we would study our message

[1:37:43] wild radical
[1:37:44] believer well there's a first time for
[1:37:48] everything
[1:37:51] Hallelujah and one thing I want to make
[1:37:53] clear
[1:37:54] what you're looking at is not somebody
[1:37:56] who comes out of Pentecostal
[1:37:58] denomination no not somebody who's come
[1:38:01] out of Methodist Church what I am is a
[1:38:04] direct product of the message of the
[1:38:09] hour
[1:38:11] Hallelujah and the message of the hour
[1:38:14] it didn't come to bind us with a bunch
[1:38:16] of quotes but it came to set us free
[1:38:20] amen free to worship free to praise free
[1:38:23] to enjoy God hallelujah that's why we
[1:38:27] lose our young people cuz they don't
[1:38:29] feel the joy in service they look at Mom
[1:38:32] and Daddy and Mom and Daddy like two
[1:38:45] robots and some of you sitting by Mom
[1:38:47] and Daddy you've become baby robots
[1:38:54] preaching 45 minutes hard and some of
[1:38:56] y'all ain't said amen
[1:38:59] yet you gave me a smile
[1:39:03] though I received a smile amen if that's
[1:39:05] where you at but you know what I want to
[1:39:07] see you in an environment where you

[1:39:39] itching cuz you're ready to receive it
[1:39:42] give me my portion brother digs why not
[1:39:45] now while the word of God is being

[1:40:42] ain't going nowhere I'm going to be
[1:40:43] right here by your side
[1:40:45] Hallelujah she says this is the deal she
[1:40:50] said cuz whatever happens whether you
[1:40:52] take it or don't take it you going to
[1:40:55] have to live with
[1:40:56] it she said but whatever decision is
[1:40:59] made I'm going to always be mom I'm
[1:41:02] going to always be right here going
[1:41:03] through it with you she said so whatever

[1:41:08] years ago be I mean years after because
[1:41:11] I didn't understand spiritual things God
[1:41:14] was showing me right there in that
[1:41:15] moment between me and my mom what she
[1:41:19] allowed to happen was my faith be
[1:41:21] activated
[1:41:23] because what was happening Hallelujah
[1:41:25] Mark 11 and 23 was becoming a reality
[1:41:29] right there whatsoever you say
[1:41:31] hallelujah When you pray or you believe
[1:41:34] you'll have what you ask for Hallelujah
[1:41:36] so what she did she said Son whatever
[1:41:38] you say hallelujah that's what we going
[1:41:41] to stand on if you take it we going to
[1:41:44] stand on it if you don't take it we
[1:41:46] going to stand on it but the decision is
[1:41:49] according to your faith W Hallelujah and
[1:41:53] I said you know what I said you know
[1:41:54] what Ma I said Ma I ain't taking it she
[1:41:56] said all right well the Bible says
[1:41:58] hallelujah if two or three of us would
[1:42:00] touch and agree concerning anything
[1:42:02] we'll have what we ask
[1:42:05] for church this
[1:42:08] word the operation of this word it
[1:42:11] doesn't have an age
[1:42:16] limit if you could just tap
[1:42:18] in it don't work like it always works 15
[1:42:23] 10 Josiah was 8 years old it'll always
[1:42:26] work so in that moment Hallelujah I said
[1:42:29] I ain't taking it mama said okay let's
[1:42:31] pray she had to pray cuz I ain't had the
[1:42:33] Holy Ghost Hallelujah parents don't let
[1:42:36] the devil fool you Hallelujah that you
[1:42:39] standing over your child because they
[1:42:40] don't have the Holy Ghost and he'll tell
[1:42:42] you it ain't working because they doing
[1:42:44] this and they ain't doing keep
[1:42:46] standing keep praying keep believing
[1:42:49] Hallelujah I believe there's a place in
[1:42:51] the token where the Prophet says you act
[1:42:53] as their Holy Ghost
[1:42:56] Hallelujah and you know Church in that
[1:42:59] moment she says okay let's pray we pray
[1:43:01] then the doctors come back in and they
[1:43:03] said so what do you decide I said I'm
[1:43:06] not going to take
[1:43:07] it boy y should seen demons come out of
[1:43:11] them you're not going to take it you're
[1:43:13] going to die you're going to be a
[1:43:15] vegetable you're not going to have a
[1:43:17] good life this cancer is spreading to
[1:43:19] your body and on and on and on and on
[1:43:21] everything negative
[1:43:24] and you know what they didn't let up
[1:43:26] until they start seeing tears come out
[1:43:27] of my eyes you know why because I didn't
[1:43:30] have a nature
[1:43:31] change and I knew I wasn't ready to
[1:43:38] die I knew I wasn't ready Hallelujah to
[1:43:41] meet my
[1:43:43] reward so I'm crying and tears are
[1:43:45] coming out my eyes and the doctor he
[1:43:48] says okay okay son okay son so you know
[1:43:52] uh are you going to take it or
[1:43:58] not are you going to take
[1:44:01] it
[1:44:08] no if you got to cry your tears you cry
[1:44:11] your tears but you still stand firm on
[1:44:14] the word of
[1:44:16] God hallelujah if you got to feel a
[1:44:18] little pain you feel your pain
[1:44:20] Hallelujah but you still stand firm on
[1:44:22] the word of God if you got to be
[1:44:24] forsaken you be forsaken but you still
[1:44:27] stand firm on the word of God because
[1:44:31] now God has to do his
[1:44:36] part
[1:44:38] Hallelujah Church doctor said this is
[1:44:40] not a game we can make a decision
[1:44:42] without you we could go out the room and
[1:44:46] make a decision with your mom my mom was
[1:44:48] like y'all ain't heard what he
[1:44:50] said is what he say he said he ain't
[1:44:54] going to take it so he ain't going to
[1:44:55] take it you know what the doctors
[1:45:02] did Church you got the
[1:45:06] power for the kind of results you want
[1:45:10] in God
[1:45:14] listen as you can
[1:45:17] see I'm
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:21] Healed
[1:45:26] Hallelujah without chemo without
[1:45:30] radiation Hallelujah without another
[1:45:33] surgery all I had was Isaiah 53
[1:45:37] Hallelujah and if it did it for me back
[1:45:40] then Isaiah 53 can still do it right now
[1:45:44] right now in elter Kentucky God is still
[1:45:47] a
[1:45:50] Healer church and that testimony has
[1:45:53] bought me through diagnosis of diabetes
[1:45:55] diagnosis of of of so many other
[1:45:58] different things and he's still the
[1:46:03] same Hallelujah but you have to live by
[1:46:07] vision and God allowed me to step into
[1:46:10] the vision of my mom Hallelujah who had
[1:46:13] a healing Hallelujah a belief of healing
[1:46:16] for her son Hallelujah and here I am as
[1:46:20] the results of it Hallelujah in church
[1:46:23] look the prophet of God said he said
[1:46:24] what is a vision he said a vision let's
[1:46:28] let's just read something right quick he
[1:46:29] says a spiritual dream is interpreted
[1:46:32] rightly interpreted is the same as a
[1:46:35] vision and what is a vision a vision is
[1:46:38] the forast of the future events it
[1:46:41] foretells the things before it happens
[1:46:44] and that's the way God always vindicates
[1:46:47] whether it was true or not Hallelujah so
[1:46:50] I stand here as
[1:46:53] truth I stand here that Isaiah 53 is
[1:46:57] real Hall I stand here hallelujah I
[1:47:01] stand here that when God said he's a
[1:47:03] Healer is
[1:47:05] true I stand here when God said he's
[1:47:08] deliverer is true I stand here when God
[1:47:11] said he's a savior is true
[1:47:14] Hallelujah church and I can go on and on
[1:47:17] and on Hallelujah I stand here when God
[1:47:21] say he's a provider is
[1:47:24] true church in 2009 God pushed me to go
[1:47:28] be a full-time evangelist and I've been
[1:47:30] doing that since 2009 Hallelujah without
[1:47:33] the connections of a job or a part-time
[1:47:35] fulltime you know what I mean and God
[1:47:37] has just been making a way yeah it gets
[1:47:40] tough
[1:47:42] sometimes but God said he's a
[1:47:46] provider Hallelujah and I got needs
[1:47:49] right now but what I can do I can look
[1:47:52] back on what God has already provided
[1:47:54] and I can say God if you did it back
[1:47:56] then you can do it right
[1:47:58] now let's live by
[1:48:03] Vision speak your
[1:48:05] [Applause]
[1:48:09] future I'm believe I'm believe now see I
[1:48:12] like I like to step way out
[1:48:14] there when it look like I shouldn't be

[1:48:20] house I want to buy it cost about
[1:48:21] 300,000 something like that something

[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:48] Hallelujah church let me get to this and
[1:50:51] I'mma close
[1:50:53] reason why I read this story Abraham
[1:50:56] said God you promised me a child a
[1:51:01] seed that was going to be like the stars
[1:51:03] and the only person I got in my life is
[1:51:05] this Ela my servant then God comes and
[1:51:08] tell him he said no ELA is not going to
[1:51:10] be the one he said look what I want you
[1:51:13] to do is tell Ela to go find Isaac a
[1:51:15] bride so he tells elar hey go back to
[1:51:18] our Kindred and go find my son or wife
[1:51:22] he said but make sure she believe what
[1:51:23] we
[1:51:25] believe Hallelujah make sure she got the
[1:51:28] same standards we got now eler go back
[1:51:31] and read it church for the sake of time
[1:51:33] I'm just going to quote it eler goes out
[1:51:36] and he
[1:51:37] says man this is a hard task he says
[1:51:41] this is a lot to be called to do he said
[1:51:44] but I don't know how to choose a bride
[1:51:46] for my Master's uh uh son he said so
[1:51:49] this is what I'mma do he said Lord he
[1:51:52] went into prayer Hallelujah church if
[1:51:55] you're in a spot in your life and you
[1:51:57] don't know what to do take it to the
[1:51:59] Lord in
[1:52:01] prayer Hallelujah but don't go in prayer
[1:52:05] doubting go into prayer
[1:52:08] believing you know what a doubtful
[1:52:10] prayer sounds like I'm going give you a
[1:52:12] doubtful
[1:52:14] prayer oh
[1:52:16] Lord
[1:52:17] father the devil is fighting so bad oh
[1:52:21] Lord father father the devil is he's
[1:52:24] doing so many things in our lives and oh
[1:52:27] lord the devil he's mess up our finances
[1:52:30] and God you're able but the Devil he's
[1:52:33] he's done this and lord the devil and
[1:52:35] lord the devil and oh lord the devil and
[1:52:38] oh the devil the
[1:52:40] devil you talk about the devil more than
[1:52:42] you talk about God In
[1:52:44] Prayer you think God is hearing that you
[1:52:47] exalt the enemy in your prayer
[1:52:52] that's a doubtful prayer you giving more
[1:52:55] credit to the enemy than you is
[1:52:57] God so you know what I do in my prayer
[1:53:00] hallelu sometimes the prophet of God say
[1:53:03] you start with
[1:53:04] worship h i don't just go asking
[1:53:07] sometimes I get in there I put them in
[1:53:09] put them in place Hallelujah put them
[1:53:11] where you at I
[1:53:13] start How
[1:53:15] Great Is Our God sing with me how
[1:53:21] great is Our God and all will see how
[1:53:26] great How
[1:53:29] Great Is Our
[1:53:31] God and you know sometimes it it just
[1:53:34] don't be clicking you know what I mean
[1:53:35] you get down in prayer you got so much
[1:53:37] on your mind then you got to press in a
[1:53:39] little bit deeper a little bit deeper
[1:53:42] and then you have to you're the name
[1:53:45] above all
[1:53:47] names see you're putting them on that
[1:53:49] pedestal Hallelujah now let me ask you
[1:53:51] something if if you put God on a
[1:53:53] pedestal you think he'll be able to
[1:53:56] resist that was kind of weak
[1:53:59] now Hallelujah some of you ain't got no
[1:54:02] confidence in your prayer life
[1:54:04] hallelujah amen if you put God on a
[1:54:07] pedestal you say Lord You're great Lord
[1:54:09] you're mighty You're My All In All
[1:54:11] you're my peace you're my banner you're
[1:54:13] my shield you're my warrior Hallelujah
[1:54:17] you're my today you're my tomorrow
[1:54:19] you're my future Hallelujah
[1:54:22] H you're my substance you're my bread
[1:54:26] you're my water you're the reason why I
[1:54:28] live You're My Breath You think if you
[1:54:32] exalt God like that he'll be able to
[1:54:36] resist you'll have to show up Hallelujah
[1:54:41] and church you think about it you get to
[1:54:43] that spot where you prayer prayer and
[1:54:45] you you did like like like Ela did he
[1:54:48] said Lord he said I'm not able to choose
[1:54:51] a bride he he said but let the woman
[1:54:54] that comes out to get
[1:54:56] water when she gets water she gives me
[1:54:58] something to drink but not only me but
[1:55:02] all my
[1:55:04] camels by this I'll know she's the
[1:55:09] one but the significance of it is
[1:55:14] Rebecca had to be a woman that could
[1:55:17] fulfill a vision Hallelujah she wasn't
[1:55:21] just a person carrying in a water poot
[1:55:23] she was a person sensitive enough for
[1:55:26] her lot in the future Hallelujah in
[1:55:29] church there are things about our lives
[1:55:32] that we may walk into good or bad but
[1:55:35] God want us to get to a place where
[1:55:37] we'll be able to tap into the things
[1:55:39] that he's ordained for us and walk in it
[1:55:43] in faith with no doubt Hallelujah and
[1:55:46] here comes Rebecca Hallelujah just the
[1:55:48] Bible says as soon as he was done
[1:55:51] speaking Rebecca came out there
[1:55:54] Hallelujah she came out there with that
[1:55:56] water pot and he says can you give me
[1:55:59] something to drink he gives us something
[1:56:00] to
[1:56:00] drink he she gives him something to
[1:56:02] drink and then automatically Hallelujah
[1:56:06] she starts to fulfill the prayer
[1:56:08] Hallelujah she gets the
[1:56:13] water now I want you to understand
[1:56:16] something this man had 10
[1:56:20] camels that was no easy task Hallelujah
[1:56:25] you know one camel can drink up to 20
[1:56:28] gallons of
[1:56:29] water so this was a woman who was
[1:56:32] faithful
[1:56:34] Hallelujah her character showed that she
[1:56:36] was faithful amen she didn't stop in the
[1:56:39] midst of the vision and say that's too
[1:56:41] much one camel is good enough no she
[1:56:44] went from that one to the next one that
[1:56:46] one to the ne now let me ask you is your
[1:56:48] faithfulness are you Faithful enough to
[1:56:51] fulfill the vision for your life
[1:56:54] Hallelujah and look church 20 10 camels
[1:56:59] is over 200 gallons of
[1:57:04] water to show you how powerful that is
[1:57:07] sisters when was the last time you went
[1:57:09] to Walmart and bought 200 gallons of
[1:57:16] milk now
[1:57:19] listen that statement almost seems
[1:57:21] ridiculous is
[1:57:23] Right
[1:57:25] Hallelujah but that was her lot that was
[1:57:27] she was fulfilling as she stepped into
[1:57:30] the vision Hallelujah it couldn't be 10
[1:57:33] gallons it had to be over 200 Hallelujah
[1:57:37] she had to be built in such a way to be
[1:57:39] able to fulfill the desires of who
[1:57:42] Abraham Hallelujah she wasn't fulfilling
[1:57:45] the desires of eler no the choosing of a

[1:59:41] message which you can't separate the two
[1:59:43] they're one hallelujah hallelujah to
[1:59:46] show us what the future will be and the
[1:59:50] world doesn't realize it but right now
[1:59:52] we understand we're looking at the
[1:59:53] future he said just like it was in the
[1:59:56] days of lot so shall it be are we in the
[2:00:00] days of lot homosexuality lesbianism is
[2:00:03] running wild we're here in the days of
[2:00:06] lot they got more rights than some of us
[2:00:09] got Hallelujah he says just like it was
[2:00:12] in Noah's day he said they got married
[2:00:14] they gave him marriage they buildt
[2:00:16] houses they planted they did all these
[2:00:18] things do we see it Church we're right
[2:00:21] here living out the
[2:00:25] future he said so shall it be when the
[2:00:28] son of man is being revealed so if we
[2:00:31] can see lot's day if we can see Noah's
[2:00:33] day shouldn't we also be able to reflect
[2:00:37] that God himself is being
[2:00:41] revealed to his bride to his wife God
[2:00:46] himself is making himself known God
[2:00:49] himself is becoming visible
[2:00:52] God himself is having relations with his
[2:00:55] wife God himself is allowing himself to
[2:00:58] be touched
[2:01:00] Hallelujah if we can see Noah's day if
[2:01:04] we can see Hallelujah lot's day
[2:01:07] shouldn't we also be able to see our

[2:01:15] right here in our time
[2:01:17] Hallelujah and church but what God what
[2:01:19] but what the enemy wants us to do is get

[2:01:23] and become good church
[2:01:28] people good cold
[2:01:32] formal powerless church

[2:01:39] step into the vision H and believe those
[2:01:42] things that are not as though they are
[2:01:44] then you're walking according to
[2:01:45] Abraham's seed Hallelujah when we look
[2:01:49] at the world and all the things that's
[2:01:50] taking place in this world and will say

[2:04:09] so strong church one day we was walking

[2:04:27] house in a hurricane which was in Miami
[2:04:30] the winds were so strong they were
[2:04:32] beating her house in West Palm Beach
[2:04:34] which is probably an hour apart hour and
[2:04:35] 30 minutes maybe it was beating her
[2:04:37] house and as it was beating her house a
[2:04:41] soulence
[2:04:42] came that God is my
[2:04:45] protector and as she's sitting there

[2:05:18] and pray through Hallelujah whatever it
[2:05:21] is however God uses you when adversity

[2:05:39] per hour and it's beating on the house
[2:05:41] trees are falling down all these things
[2:05:44] and the words of the song start coming
[2:05:46] strong winds are blowing with an
[2:05:49] unrelenting Force but it's it's going to
[2:05:52] take a stronger wind in
[2:05:55] this to keep me from my
[2:05:58] promises it's going to take a stronger
[2:06:01] win than this to turn me around it's
[2:06:05] going to take a stronger win than this
[2:06:09] because my feet are on Solid
