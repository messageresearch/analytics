now amen praise the lord god is good it's always good to see what about amen praise the lord so i trust everybody's having a good week amen and feeling good amen let's just bow our heads we'll go into the word now amen and since you're part of it lord jesus we come before you lord thanking you god for your grace and for your mercy to us lord and how did you lead us and guide us lord jesus and what you are to as father as we focus tonight lord jesus on you and what you are and what you mean to us we ask god for the inspiration of the holy spirit just to come down and just help the lord to be able to say the words that would go down and heal the people that would cause strength to come into people lord jesus that are perhaps weak or whatever it might be and we do want to thank you lord jesus for the healing power lord jesus that we each and every one different ones especially have experienced in the last week lord jesus your deliverance father and we ask god that you just bless the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you want us to speak on the night bless the reading of the word lord as we open it we know that only you can really bring out the true interpretation of it lord and father we ask god that you just bless each one that is assembled and those that are out on the waves lord tonight we ask god that you just bless them in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord if you will turn your bibles amen turn your bibles just more this evening amen let's go to matthew if you will matthew 27 and we'll begin with uh verse 62. now the next day that followed the day of preparation matthew 27 62 the chief priests and the pharisees came together unto pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day these disciples come by night and seal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first pilate said unto them ye have ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made the sepulcher sealing the stone and setting a watch amen now turn your bibles to hebrews 6 if you want hebrews 6. and i want you to notice i'll comment on this while you're turning what i want to speak on tonight is that word sure amen so that's going to be our title tonight is that word sure amen if you'll notice we wanted to use that illustration there of how did pilate tried to make the tomb of jesus sure amen now over in hebrews 6 and verse we'll begin with uh verse 18. that by 2 chapter 6 verse 18 that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for god to lie we have might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure amen both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil may god had this blessing to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight amen sunday i focused on a little bit on how that the christians desire something that is eternal something that lasts right so tonight we want to talk a little bit for a little while with the help of the lord about surety i mean i'm something that is sure and when i think about that word sure the more i think about it the better i like it i mean i believe it's the prophet of god that said that he liked that word perseverant real well but i like this word sure also because this word here really only belongs to one person are you ready this word sure is only belongs to one person and that is god amen because there is nothing else that's sure right amen heaven and earth will pass away it's not sure there's so many things tonight that's not sure amen uh to me it it illustrates something that's going to be or it's an absolute amen and i believe god used it uh you know or should i say satan used it in eve in in the garden of eden with eve when he said when he was changing the word of god and and he twisted the word uh you know and he says when god said that you are going to die if you eat of it but the serpent said you are not surely going to die he took something that was sure and made it unsure isn't that right he twisted it he said not surely because you know what surely is it's gonna be ain't no changing it it's absolute amen i mean no the word of god is sure if you're not tied to this sure you're not going to be sure and we have a lot of unsurety in the world today don't we a lot of in unsurety i was just thinking and meditating on this and i was thinking about how that the times that you are and i are living in are really unsure times it reminded me of uh scripture i believe in the old testament somewhere talk about how israelis said they were supposed to stay close to the ark because they hadn't passed this way before and i got to thinking about how you and i for the most part of our lives we've had pretty normal lives but in the last five years we have seen a major changes take place and every almost weekly something changes right and it's changing really really rapidly amen you know and uh uh what is it they call it the uh you know things are just falling apart eroding you know they talk about the erosion of the constitution the erosion of law the erosion of morality erode everything's eroding and not only roading but it's shaking how many believe we're living in shaking times amen we're living in shaking times and god said that everything that can be shaken will be shaken amen and only god's word is going to remain and to be sure and so we look at that and i thought i would begin to think how we haven't really went this way before amen and and and but you know the other thought that i had there was i like the second thought that came to my mind are you ready all right the second thought that came to mind you and i personally perhaps haven't went this way before but god has god has been here multiple times isn't that right amen ends what i'm talking about is the ends of civilizations or kingdoms he has seen the fries and the fall of many of them and especially in the days of noah when he seen the end of all humanity coming right he seen the end of all humanity coming and you know those people those people were just sure that it wasn't going to rain i mean they gambled their lives upon it didn't they they gambled their lives upon it but the good part about it is is we haven't went into on these shaky grounds knowing that it's going to get more shaky it's going to get worse all the way to the way i see it as a minister the way that it's going to get all the way worse until it comes down to the boy caught you or to put a squeeze on your finances your finances unless you don't come the way they want you to come mark of the beast that's that right that's according to descriptions the way that the prophet taught it that's where how bad it's gonna get amen and so you'll find out that it's it's a shaking time and i also kind of compared it in my mind with california and the prophecy the sure prophecy that we have thus saith the lord california going to see los angeles going to sink right amen and how many times we as message believers have talked about i wouldn't want to live in california right who wants to live in california knowing it's going to go down yeah and so we wouldn't want to live there because we know it's going to go down and you know you can just imagine this now how that perhaps one of these days it'll rock it'll shake it'll crack off and it'll crumble the sky rises everything will go down and perhaps the place some of the planes will just be leaving as the ground crumbles under him and imagine yourself there imagine yourself there and there's a plane leaving in five minutes and this whole place is gonna be a swamp with water in about ten so load and get on board would you hurt yourself getting on board you probably heard the next guy treat you getting on board but yeah you'd want to make sure you got on board anything and how good it would feel to get your feet off the ground and knowing that you're not going to go down with it right now how many knows even brother bam says you know that in the under the sixth seal the volcanoes will go up and this place will shake and it'll be turned inside out and everything all of this the whole world is doomed for such a scenario amen and how many knows it's sure to happen it is going to happen now unfortunately i'm here to tell you that even though you wouldn't live in california but i'm talking about how those nukes and everything could be up in the air in the next five minutes we have no promise of tomorrow why because this earth is doomed it's prophesied to go down and in hebrews it says that we have fled for refuge huh let me know i don't know about you but i care about my life i hope you care about your life and i have fled for refuge i don't care if it would be a helicopter i don't care if i'd have to time myself to erupt to something just get me out this rock that's going down well that's the way it is spiritually whatever it takes lord i don't want to go down with this thing i don't want to be left here in the tribulation period huh because i'm afraid too many melancholy christians are going to find themselves in this tribulation period they're going to tell themselves you know i just didn't take it serious enough huh but how many knows the christians god's gonna do something to the real christian he's gonna have you be ready amen we're gonna take wednesday nights we're gonna take some we're gonna take monday tuesday wednesday amen whatever it takes we're gonna be ready to leave this place because we don't wanna be lacks a day's ego we don't wanna be here when all of that happens because it's sure to happen amen and we've laid fled for refuge to lay holes huh to lay a hold on something the hope that is set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul is sure i like that in a world of uncertainty in a future that is certainly uncertain i'm sure you can have surety you can be sure amen aren't you glad for that that you can be sure god wants us to be sure he said we have laid half as an anchor on our show it's both sure and i like the other word to use steadfast amen steadfast it holds amen just like that boat brother brown says when he was coming in on an airplane they seen that big old ship out there in the ocean and it was so horribly rough it looked like it was going to sink but somebody on the on beside him says no it's not going to sink because it has a sea anchor and it's gripping that rock amen and as long as it just has a hole in the rock he can't go sideways and capsize it's going to go right through it the waves will come over and around it but it's it's gonna make it that's the way a christian is we have an anchor that's both sure and steadfast and if you aren't anchored to christ and i thought about this because how many knows the revelation of jesus christ is the rock huh it's not this word is the rock but if you're not anchored to that rock the right don't do you any good and a revelation or a personal relationship and walk with almighty god experience with almighty god young people it's the only thing that's going to hold you everybody else drifts off drifts off amen i hope to if i have time tonight to bring it down to a personal base personal basis on this amen both sure my my my if you want to even begin to imagine how unsure and shifting things are go out there and try to find a decent looking human being anymore everybody's got nose okay folks nose rings and earrings tattoos everywhere and dress every old way it's just a terrible world it's getting worse all the time huh we need an anchor we need something that's sure it's just drifting the whole world has drifted and it's drifting faster and faster people drift we drift i drift huh well get into don't don't let me forget i want to really get into this because we want to get down to where it it it is part of us paul talked the good that they would that i do not and so forth amen this body here it wants to shift all the time amen but i looked at this and we find out that [Applause] piloting them they thought they could make it sure huh they thought that they could put us some some of their good soldiers there and we're gonna make absolutely sure that he don't come up out of there huh but like i said there's only one real sure and it's not man man can't say sure huh nebuchadnezzar and baldi's hazer the greatest kingdom of all they thought they were secure huh they thought they were sure but they weren't were they no right at the very time that they were doing all that the enemy was going way down the river of the river and diverting the river so they could go right under the gates and then come in right through there through the dry river bed amen and they did didn't talk about america and when any country it begins to think that they're secure how did they let down and to go into sin huh we think we have nukes huh my doesn't make you secure one bit does it know your your capabilities your your powers and so forth no it's got nothing to do with security nothing to do with being sure the only surety is it's god amen let me tell you when god begins to die like that when god begins to do something ain't enough devils in hell to ever stop it amen praise be to god i'm so thankful tonight to have a place that you can be sure about how many notes god said malachi 4 jesus christ himself come down and absolutely time after time made himself known to the people that he's alive well so that you could be what sure that you could know that you know that you know amen i like that song brother josh be very sure because this is an hour then you've got to be very sure now god is sure but do you realize that god wants not just himself to be sure he wants you to be sure let me uh kind of get off the side here for a minute daniel this just has one more quote on surety daniel the second chapter you remember the vision that nebuchadnezzar had of the golden head and of the person and so forth and uh you know all the way down to the co pose and so forth i'll make this quick 2 and 45 43 and whereas thou saw's iron mixed with myery clay huh what was iron kushchev [Music] or was chris jeff clay and eisenhower was iron and then what the prophet yeah the prophet of god said when when uh i believe it was christian he grabbed his shoe and hit the table with it to get everybody's attention at a big meeting they had it signified they were down by those toes that he talked about the kingdoms and so forth amen and all right all the way down when daniel saw the whole future of all of humanity right he saw everything that there was going to be all the way down to a kush chef and i i is an hour and they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another have you ever noticed how do we just can't get along huh trump even tried you know why why can't we be friends why can't we be friends now yo he's friends with them he's you know he's a you know boy oh boy here we go right you just can't we don't seem to be able to cleave one to another as iron does not mix with clay and in the days of the king shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom we shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break to pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever see folks this is where you read between the lines and realize that you are part of that kingdom that shall never be destroyed how many is glad to be a part of it that's right this kingdom it could never end i mean if we're in the kingdom of god right now it'll never end and it is going to break to pieces and consume all these other kingdoms for as much as thou saw as the stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver the gold the great god has made known to the king what shall come to pass here after the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof is sure amen and i remember over there in hebrews it says we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken how many knows the devil tries to get you he tries to shake us let me tell you something this anything outside of a genuine new birth can be shaken but a real genuine new birth holy ghost experience faith in almighty god it cannot be shaken jesus says any man it comes to me will you know no man can pluck him out of my hands isn't that right i'm not a loser one of them he said amen i'm thankful for that so he's sure this is sure amen let me see i'm trying to find that place where it talks about well it shall break them to pieces and consume all the others i thought it talked about grinding them to powder in other words it's not going to be nothing but ashes left of all of these kingdoms amen that's not very sure not very that's not something solid i mean but it's the truth amen in that way it's sure amen but we don't want no part of that amen surety be certain of god i mean remember this message called be certain be sure of god this is our brothers and sisters that you want to be sure that you want to know and god has a way of making you sure amen amen making us sure creating that sureness in us amen be certain of god brother brahm says it this way you know when we have confessed our sins and met every requirement that god requires he says and we've confessed to it all and we've made all wrongs right everything we know of done everything that we know to do every requirement that god has made we've met every requirement yet sometimes he lays still and he don't answer us now this is god working on you and me as an individual he says and i'm sure that i'm speaking to peoples this morning who's come to that place we can all say amen probably i've been there many times myself when i've trade things back in my life turned over every stone try to make everything right amen but yet he says i have met it and still he won't move seems like he's silent that's when you have to be sure that he's god don't be discouraged the only thing is that in your heart you are certain that he ends amen my you know sometimes we think well this happens to me because i did this or i did that or the other no not always amen not always how many remembers jesus said i'm jesus out in the old testament jehovah of the old testament became jesus of the new so he said you know to the devil about job he says he's the most perfect and upright man in the land he was a godly man he feared god he made sure that every sacrifice was made the sins of his children covered his sin skill covered everything was covered and then all of a sudden everything that could happen did i mean things went really bad all of his riches vanished in one day a bunch of thieves and robbers huh oh my i have no i've never learned this as an amish boy you won't learn it as a mennonite or a baptist or harder to anybody out there but if you'll notice before any of these things happened somebody got permission didn't they yeah they had to have permission because he says it you know the devil said to god yeah you know he don't serve you for naught you know he you've got your heads around him but let this happen to you let that happen to him and he'll curse you to your face and then god says go ahead he had to give him the good just don't touch his life and so forth isn't that right he had to give him the permission he had to take the hedge down amen to a perfect and upright man he believed god and now this happens his whole financial world comes down and not only that folks it wasn't just his financial world that was destroyed his family was destroyed now folks if the first one you can pass with i can maybe get by with that but when it's your family when it's your sons and your daughters that you've raised i wonder where we would stand huh folks it'd be real hard i believe it was nine of them isn't that right the house fell in on it he allowed the devil to get into the wind and make a tornado and go and knock that house down kill him huh that had to be real hard but what was god doing amen making job and testing his faith trying him seeing if he was really sure amen i believe god does that to you and me he wants you he wants to make sure that you are really sure and that sure has to do with faith because that's the only thing that's sure amen faith is the only thing that'll really hold on real genuine faith it don't let go no matter what the circumstances are amen amen don't be discouraged oh my listen so he says if you're certain of god you're sure that he's god that's when faith goes to work right there faith stands steady for it knows that he is you've met every requirement you believe that he is faith holds steady oh my blessed be his name faith won't move for sure that god is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him amen oh may this go way down and never move from you random tabernacle eating like tabernacle if you've met god's requirement and in your art you believe that he is he is only testing your faith amen my because you know and i know as well as any time that if you're ever gonna be unsure it's not on the mountaintops but it's done in the valleys it's down into hard times amen remember young people you've got it coming that test is coming to you that's what the prophet said he says every son that comes is tested to the ultimos you'll be tested on this and that what the teacher says now read that good because you're going gonna be tested on this you have a test on it you heard it tonight you're gonna be test sooner or later you're a child of god god is gonna find out whether you really believe it or not whether you're absolutely sure because if you're sure that means you've got your anchor that is sure the anchor that's in our heart how many believes it it's a sure anchor when it's gripped on the silent rock it's sure now if you're hooked on feelings if your anchors on feelings emotions or a mental understanding of the word you're going to be flung all over the place by these waves that come along these temptations that this age offers is going to throw you for a loop you'll never be able to resist against the temptations of this age outside of the baptism of the holy ghost amen brother balor that's the truth you'll never resist these temptations the devil's got out there amen it's too strong amen got to have the holy ghost and you've got to have that blessed assurance that jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine make a way down listen i like this now he loves to test us he loves to see your reaction or the reaction of your faith oh man i've preached this a million times in this pulpit but i gotta say it again god loves to see what you do in extreme situations because what you do in extreme situations is what class i've taught you this many times what are you under pressure you are what you are under pressure it shows what you are it shows who you are amen how many knows we're defined by the decisions that we make i mean we are shown what we are by the decisions that we make amen people know us by the choices that we make you know yourself by the choices you make amen and i don't know about you but i'd like to be able to jump from here to there to know that you don't always pass the test but if you're a child of god you'll get on your knees and say god i shouldn't have done that amen when you do that it shows your child of god but if you just walk away and hey i never did nothing wrong there's something serious wrong with that man there's something seriously wrong with that woman when they just walk away and never even see their own fault and mistakes and just think they're right anyway you are in the wrong direction amen how many believes that god wants to make you sure he wants to make he wants us to be sure because this is the age when you've got to be sure that you're sure as they say you gotta know that you know that you know amen praise the lord how many knows job he knew because even his friend said now now job come on now somewhere in your life you got some secret sin huh god wouldn't punish a man like this if you didn't have some secrets in i've been told that before or heard that it was said about me gotta have some secrets in and i don't say i'm faultless not here to say i'm a joke and i'm perfect but i don't believe that's what it was all about i think i just had some really good friends like job did huh uh we better get off that wagon but anyway come on folks and he knew he said no no no i've made everything right i've cleaned out my closet i've got i made the sacrifice i know that in my heart i'm right so don't give me that huh he didn't understand it because the first round wasn't enough losing his children his riches next time they met again the devil says you know god says look at him he's faithful yeah he is skin for skin but he says but you touch his body and he'll curse you and god said okay touch his body just don't take his life in other words you can take him all the way to where his heart beat goes down to maybe six seven eight times a minute i don't know but you just can't kill him he can't die under your hand and he won't die under your hand and he was so miserable oh my folks come on let's admit it being perhaps so sick and oh my i just want to die or you're just feeling so horrible i don't know that anybody any of us have ever come this close what job did and feeling completely miserable no no i don't believe we have because he had he had he had sores and and and he was so miserable he i for mother said he says why was i ever born and and god take the day away that i was ever born and oh my all kinds of things he said you know and his wife finally says man you're so miserable i i love you honey i just want you out of your misery basically right why don't you just go ahead and curse god and die yeah maybe she did it out of love huh i'm sure she didn't do it out of meanness i'm sure he had a good wife huh but look at that he says you speak like a foolish like he didn't call you foolish woman you quit talking now he said you speak like a foolish woman you know what he said he says am i gonna take good from god and then not take that come on christians that put that in a hard drive you expect to get good from god and you don't want to take bad when he has it to you the lord gives you and he's got the right to take it away blessed be the name of the lord that's our attitude ain't it design amen all these trials all these tests that come you where e are to make you more sure it's not to give you road rage it's not to drive you crazy like we feel like sometimes i'm gonna write if it gets any worse i'm just gonna lose my mind no it's the drive you turn your knees and from your knees it takes deep deeper root in god and say god i can't get over it i can't get under it i can't get around it i don't know what to do with this problem amen the best problems are the ones that you can't handle because i'll handle a problem if i can you'll handle a problem if we all will because we like a sure life how many likes is your life amen those over there in uh ukraine right now they don't have a sure life that's a terrible way to have to be in that right we should appreciate amen so anyways god loves to see your reaction because he wants to know he wants to know that you're angry he wants to anchor you amen and he wants you to be sure and we all know and i'm going to say it again that there's only one place that's sure that is in christ i mean how many knows there's no other everything else is all other ground is sinking sand all of the ground is sinking sand just comes to mind so i'll say it well right here's a scripture for it not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father many will come to me that say that say well i thought i was for sure right with you well i i prophesied in your name and in my name cast out many devils and done many mighty work they thought they were sure i mean there's a world full of people out there that thought they were sure but when it came to obeying this word they just didn't think they really had to how many knows that's the only kind workers of iniquity knowing to do better not doing it they know that ah the word says this but i don't really want to do that it doesn't cut how much profit saying you do how many devils you cast out you're on uncertain ground and millions are in that place amen but i like this part he'll say no i don't like this part here because i feel bad for them and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me that work iniquity this part i do like therefore whosoever hears these things of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a man which built his house upon a rock help me preach upon a rock a solid foundation how many knows jesus is the chief cornerstone anything that's built got to be built on the word anything thomas or any preacher preaches has to be on the word amen i might say well this is what i think and you might hear it but it's not what you take for gospel amen before i tell you my shifting sands idea i'm probably going to give you a heads up here here's my idea when i say that yeah a little those tenants go up and realize hey now this is not gospel they brought about preaching amen praise the lord you love the lord tonight how many is glad to have that you know what i would suggest that we leave the lights turned on we leave the place open if there's anybody that's not sure you stay right here close the door whatever tomorrow noon whatever it takes you to get sure get your huh you can't afford to go out there and die and not be sure you have to be sure like ff boss was like different ones they made it come down to their grave come down to their deathbed they were sure they were going to meet christ they had no fear whatsoever isn't that right amen if we go by the way the grave if we'll go by the way to the grave amen man some of us we're not so far from it brother brad i used to be young but i'm 60 now i realize if i get to 70 i'm gonna be a blessed man i'm a blessed man to get to 60. we lost a lot in the 50s hello amen so praise the lord be sure be very sure and i'm thankful to have a place of surety that that there is a place that you can be sure i appreciate the message that god has sent in this day aren't you because that brought us surety it vindicated it it proved it oh my how many times you know now we've been this morning listening to multiple messages and so forth and the prophet of god saying now whatever jesus did back then if he does that today will you believe it was him well yeah of course you would believe then he would do it you know let him come i can't do anything but if you'll come amen and you can know that it's him again and we know that it's him so that you can be sure what i like about it even though we haven't down went down this crumbling the earth is oh man our our kingdom our our nation is crackling the the ground is giving and it's just about to fall is that right how many knows america is about to fall and that may be a little bit light and that rights may have fallen already it's in the fall it's already falling huh it's just fallen so hard so far and it's going to continue to fall amen and why then it makes you realize hey don't look at america okay i just thought about what i wanted to say yet in closing you look at the circles of kingdoms right you look at the rise of all the kingdoms right and the greatness of them nebuchadnezzar was the greatest then there was greece then there was rome right then there was rome and then it was russia and us and so forth and then there kicked different kingdoms north korea china all kinds of different kingdoms that's there and so forth all these different kingdoms that's rose up but do you see the rise of rome you don't hear the only thing rome around here is roman catholic church sitting over there yeah they fell right they fell uh all of them they rose he came to greatness and fell now we see our own country that feared god right feared god and and we became the greatest unbeatable god was with us and then what happened we just can't hold steady it's just not sure it may look sure but it's not because it's man's kingdom amen and it seems to go back slide back goes backwards again and falls rises and it falls rises and it falls amen just like it's a circle that it goes in amen goes back and so forth and then i thought about sometimes you know this is what i want to get to you know because i want to make sure that my anchor holds and grips the solid rock but how many this is my question how many of us tonight have made um what do you call them when you turn a new leaf a new year's resolution or whatever i've made many a resolution and you know i won't call it necessarily a resolution but i'll repent and say god i want a fresh start today anything i've done wrong lord i don't want to be like like i have been father and so forth and you get a new start and and you feel closer to god and and i remember after brother billy died i said you know i'm gonna i want to live every day like it's my last one something about it just brought me closer got to god you know i'll come to that place one day and i want to just live for god every day and and think about him and uh you know when brother danny preached that on on putting god first and many times i'll preach on god first you know and listen to that tape in the morning or listen to that tape or not do my prayer and stay close to the lord but it just seems like no time are you with me it seems like you slipped back in that other old circle and you don't have that fervency anymore you don't have that you know and and i took yesterday or today and this afternoon and i says i ain't doing nothing i'm not where i want to be with god and i and you know it's just not what i want to be and i've i i've wanted to take more time listen and so forth and hey you know i like to take the tape and play or wherever i go and whatever and soon you seem to drift away from it and i said i'm just going to take some time lord and i thought you know we do that we kind of go through that cycle that no matter how much in our minds we resolute that we're going to do this we're going to do that we're going to pray more we're going to take this body and i can understand perhaps that's what paul was talking about in romans he says the good that i would i find that that which i would not that i do oh wretched man that i am who's going to deliver me now i realize that this body there's nothing sure about this body are you with me and there's nothing sure about the desires of this flesh it all goes the wrong direction it pulls you the wrong way that's why you have to have your days that you take off to get closer to god that's why you have to have your renewals with god are you with me how many believe you have to have that renewals god let me not get drifted away don't let me drift off here huh and get cold on you and not have that intimate relationship and that joy in by heart how many knows it's easy to lose that joy that joy of the lord that's in your heart and my i believe we just get a lot of times i think we get consumed with the cares of this life and we get so busy with the cares of this life that we don't have the prayer time the time to uh listen to a tape read our bible or have the bible read to you you don't even have to read it you can have it playing in your ear amen that's better nothing is that right we have it there but just taking the time that says lord i want to be more sure i want to be steadfast i want to be more sure lord i hate this i hate this you know of of feeling like you're right where you want to be with the lord and then in a couple days you got so caught up with your job and your your your tasks that you had huh that you forgot to play a tape that day you've got to listen to where you forgot to talk to the lord amen because i like it i like it when i'm thinking on the lord and you know i've said it many times over the pulpit blessed is he whose mind is stayed on thee it truly is right but it's hard that's hard to do because of all the other things that you have to think about and and we know already that the bible says that you suppose that you think about it when you get up when you're working when you go lay down at night no matter the bible says the two on this they'll meditate day and night i believe that's the only way to stay in that place with god that you need to be amen if you find yourself going away from that you need to repent and say god get me right back because this flesh wants to go into its cycle of death how many believes in those that people that are not really genuinely born again they'll go into that cycle of death they don't never come out of it pretty soon they don't care about whether they're in church or not they don't come to church amen and they quit coming to church why because they let that flesh just carry them away if they're not a child of god amen they'll stay away but if they're a child of god god will get a hold of him young people listen you may get away from god a little bit but listen if you're really child of god you'll feel terrible you'll feel terrible in here and say god i don't want to feel like this this is not the way it's supposed to be you'll get on your knees and you'll get right with god again amen donna what was that saying that you read to me about church and people they end up not going you don't remember what you thought it was do you not you don't okay anyway there's some kind of a riddle about people who start not coming to church and then in no time you don't go to oh something about missing missing you'd have to pull it up anyway start missing and pretty soon i mean you don't go anymore and that's the way it is with your prayer life how many of those if you start missing your prayer your wall pretty soon you don't have it anymore that joy's gone that peace is gone so how many tonight will with me if you stand with me tonight just say in your heart god i know what the brother balor is talking about those little things that we played ourselves to and we find ourselves away from them and have to come back to him and and so forth lord tonight we just want to rededicate ourselves again and say lord jesus help us lord not to get away from you lord not to slip not to rise to come to the place of really being in fellowship with you just to let the cares of this world once again drag that right out of us suck it right out of us lord jesus and then we're back and not not so happy anymore and grumpy and everything else lord i ask god that you help each and every one of us and forgive us lord of where we're like that and and the good that we would lord jesus we just sometimes don't find and that which i would not sometimes we find we're doing that lord it's a body of sin it's a body that's pulling us the wrong way but there's a anchor in our heart now in our soul that's sure and steadfast and we thank you for that anchor lord and we know that it's you holding on to us we're not holding ourselves we realize it's you god that's holding on to us amen and you won't let us go because you are yours lord and we're thankful for that god bring us all to a close walk with you lord jesus and help us to remember this today lord tonight's message father of how that we need to stay focused on you and and keep our mind stayed on you more than what we do and each and every one in here lord as we raise our hands say god help me and help me to keep my mind stayed on you because there is no joy greater there is no peace created and for you to be revealing yourself to me lord and speaking through me to to me by your word and enlarges that fellowship that i can have with you and the revelation that you just pour out in our souls lord lord so many times the cares of this world it stops up the the channel lord jesus of that that revelation that's coming down in our soul and and lord you'll speak to us about what we're doing and how we're doing it and our jobs and and all the way that we're treating our children children parents and husbands wives wives and husbands and everything that we're doing you're trying to show us the right way and how to have the right atmosphere lord but the cares of life seem to drown us out lord because we're in rich laodicea and we're so busy and we've gotten too busy lord help us not to be so busy and to get time for you lord jesus because we want to be anchored in the rock of ages not in the cares of life lord just have your way in our life lord and help us to make sure to be very sure that our anchor holds and it grips the solid rock amen god bless you brother josh you if you would come how many likes that song be very sure
