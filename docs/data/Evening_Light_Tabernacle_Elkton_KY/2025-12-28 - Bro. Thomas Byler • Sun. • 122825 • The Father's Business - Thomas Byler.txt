It It's good to have our visitors with us. God bless you. And I've lost them somewhere. Where did they go to? Where's Hezekiah? Oh, right there they are. I'm sorry. I got good eyes. They just don't always work together. It's glad to have him and his mom here with us this morning. And we've got several folks out. We've got a few sick this morning. But uh I just wanted to uh read this little update. Most of you probably have already read it from Sister Parish. Says, "Please remember me in prayer. For the last couple of months at night, my body is so stiff and sore. I can't hardly get out of bed that with my feet and legs. I don't see an my oncologist till January. My strength is better and I weigh about 132 pounds now. She's really happy about her weight and she said uh I I want to uh thank brother Austin. Brother Austin, thank you for coming by and seeing her. She really appreciated that. and she said that sister Mary Jane and them brought her lunch from service last Sunday and she enjoyed the fellowship and she just uh appreciated that. So if you get a chance go by and see her and I know she'll be blessed and you'll be blessed by doing that for her and we're just thankful that the Lord's done a work for and we're just believing he's going to heal her completely. Amen. And you know and we we've got a lot to be thankful for this morning and we just want to thank the Lord this morning. And also I have one announcement I want to do that and then we're going to open the service in a word of prayer. And uh most of you know that we shut the water on and off for the fellowship hall because we have a real bad water leak. Well, there's a white thing down here where the old church used to be. So if you turn the water on when you put that cap back on there, just set it on there till you feel it snug. That's all you have to do because uh somebody put it on really good and me and brother Willie couldn't get it off without a crowbar. So, just barely snug it. When you turn the water off and on, you don't have to put much pressure. It It does it itself. So, I told Brother Willie, he's just getting old. That's what his problem is. And I'm already there. So, but God bless you. How many's happy to be a Christian this morning? Amen. Amen. And we're gonna ask Brother Glenn if he'd open the service in a word of prayer this morning. Brother Glenn. Amen.

Every knee shall bow. Every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. If you'll just go with me in the Psalms this morning. We're going to be in Psalms 25. Sure is a beautiful day out. We can enjoy the day that the Lord's given given us. It's been so good to us. Psalms 25. &gt;&gt; Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. &gt;&gt; Yay. Let none that wait on thee be ashamed. Let them be ashamed which transgress without cause. Lead me in thy truth and teach me. For thou art the God of my salvation. On thee do I wait all the day. &gt;&gt; Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions. according to thy mercy. Remember thou me for thy goodness sake, O Lord. &gt;&gt; The meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way. For thy name's sake, oh Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great. &gt;&gt; His soul shall dwell in ease, and his seed shall inherit the earth. My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. &gt;&gt; The troubles of my heart are enlarged. Oh, bring thou me out of the my distress. Consider mine enemies for they are many and they hate me with cruel hatred. &gt;&gt; Let integrity and uprightness preserve me for I will wait on thee. Redeem Israel, oh God, out of all his troubles.

He I he said because you you keep praying and telling him. He said, "Lightn will strike and hit me." And I said, I said, "Look, buddy." I said, "If it wasn't for God's grace and mercy and the blood of Jesus Christ, I'd be dead." &gt;&gt; I said, "We're we all need his salvation this morning." And I said, "That's why he shed his blood this morning. It's for your deliverance and for my deliverance this morning." I said, "I we're not any of us any good.

What is this world coming to?" And you know, as Christians, we're just we live sometimes we live in a bubble. We love our bubble that we live in because it's the Holy Spirit. And when you see this world and you think, Lord, what is going wrong? What is wrong that a man don't know what he is &gt;&gt; and a woman don't know what they are?

Amen. Oh my, feels like summer out there, don't it? My grass is fixing to grow if it don't be careful. And I know all the bugs came out of my walls and flying around. They thought it was spring time, you know. So, I'm like, y'all get back in there, you know. You ain't done yet. Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we come before you this morning, grateful, Lord, to be able to assemble ourselves together once more this side of eternity. Lord, to open your word, Father, to worship you, to gather together and worship you in spirit and in truth. Father, in spirit is where we are in your Holy Spirit, God. For we know that we have to be really truly in your spirit to be able to worship you. So, Father, we ask God that we be in spirit. And then also, Father, as we open the Bible, we know that we're reading the truth. So, Lord, in truth, we also worship you, Father. And we ask God that you'll just reveal yourself in a greater way this morning and just bless the thoughts of our heart, meditation of our heart as we try to Lord just convey to the people what Lord I feel Lord you've laid upon a heart Lord to bring to the people this morning. We ask these blessings in Jesus name. Amen and amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you this morning. We just feel uh like the Lord has laid something on our heart and I was just uh astounded really because Amen. It seems like sometimes when the things come Amen they come faster and I can write them down. Amen. Amen. And so uh Amen. the Lord's given us I don't know we'll you know how far how long we'll go on this uh but I do plan on if nothing changes minister the next three services. Amen. At least the next three. So, Amen. We might just take this this as a little series. Amen. And so, because there's so much in there and there's a lot of little rabbit trails I'd like to go down. Amen. Because, you know, just not to skip over everything, but just to try to glean out. Amen. Everything that there is. Amen. So, Amen. Amen. Brother Tommy texted this morning. Amen. It said something about pray the Lord will give you a double portion. Amen. So I says, "Boy, we're going to be here twice as long." He should have said potion. I thought he should say potion maybe. Amen. Uh double potion of anointing. Amen. Amen. Be twice as powerful instead of twice as long. Amen. But anyway, just Amen. For whatever that's worth. Amen. Amen. God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I trust you're having a good winter. Everything's going good. If you need anything, if you have any kind of need at all, Amen. We're here, Amen, to be a blessing and to help. Amen. So, never hesitate. Amen. If you need something, Amen. So, this is kind of different. I don't think in 32 years of ministering that I've ever took this subject before. So, it's a new subject. Amen. That's hard to do after preaching for 30 33 years. Amen. But anyway, um we trust that the Lord will just it'll be a blessing to you this morning. I know that this this has the potential, this message has the potential, Amen, to really lift us up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's bragging about God. It's talking about God. It's glorifying God. Amen. Amen. Because what else are you going to glorify? &gt;&gt; Whatever. What else are you going to lift up? Amen. And bring honor and glory to. Amen. So, we're going to take it slow with the help of the Lord, but just try to follow the leading of the spirit. Amen. And so, we'll turn our Bibles this morning uh to the book of Luke, if you will. Let's go to the book of Luke. Amen. The second chapter. We'll just read from verse 41 down to 49. And then I want to take really not on the main subject, but just take a little doctrine, a little thought out of this before we go on. Amen. And we'll just take it one step at a time and see what the Lord will have. Amen. Maybe maybe Tuesday night. Amen. We will speak on uh let me see what I would have maybe titled it. Uh this day are fulfilled. theseures fulfilled. Amen. Amen. And so we might Amen. Take that Tuesday if the Lord's will. We'll just see. Amen. Two. And verse 41. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover. And when he was 12 years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus terried behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. Amen. But they, him to have been in company, went a day's journey, and and they sought him among their kin folks. Must have been a pretty good little crowd, right? The whole family had to go, I guess, maybe. And when they found him, not they turned back again. Amen. I can imagine that would be kind of a disappointment, wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; I mean, a whole day's journey on with mules or whatever they had, right? Uh, you know, and they had to go all the way back. And it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. Amen. But Abraham said he was about 12 years old. And when they saw him, they were amazed. And his mother said unto him, "Son, why hast thou dealt thus with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing." And he, now notice of all the things that he could say to him, right? &gt;&gt; How many knows that whenever Jesus spoke, he always said the right thing? &gt;&gt; Amen. So much so that when the Pharisees, they tried to trick him with questions many times. Amen. And after about two or three questions and him absolutely flooring them, they dares not ask him any more questions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, amen. And so, here is another time when he makes a statement and he said unto them, "How is it that ye sought me?" Amen. He never said, "Yes, mother. Sorry, mom and dad. My father and my mother." He never said that. He said, "How is it that ye sought me? Wish ye not that I must be about my father's business." &gt;&gt; And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. Amen. May God add his blessings to the reading of words. You can be seated. &gt;&gt; There's some quite a few profound things in him in this statement. For one thing, brother Brandon preached a message and he was talking about the age that we were living in that after the church world had rejected Christ and how that they uh thought that Christ was was still with them. How many believes those churches still believe that Jesus is with them even though they he's outside of the door knocking? And he makes a statement that they have went on without him and don't realize that he's not with them anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't put Christ out and expect him still to be with you. And that's why they're in the condition that they're in. The other thing I want to bring here is brother Benaman as he he uh expounded on this and he says, you know, even Mary and Joseph didn't understand what he meant by what he just said. THE BOY WAS 12 YEARS OLD. WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS is the boy going to have? And his father, they thought, well, Joseph, you know, this don't LOOK LIKE CONSTRUCTION WORK TO ME BECAUSE HIS FATHER, SO TO SPEAK, EARTHLY SPEAKING, it's what they supposed uh would be JOSEPH WOULD BE A CARPENTER BECAUSE JOSEPH WAS A CARPENTER. BUT YET HERE HE WAS up in the synagogue TALKING TO THE PRIEST ASKING HIM QUESTIONS and answering them so much SO THAT THIS LITTLE boy could answer questions and flabbergast the priests. Wow, where does this boy get all this knowledge? Remember that was just in his infancy. Amen. But the point was is that he was about his father's business. And you want to pull that up this morning. I want to preach on the father's business. The father's business. Amen. Thought about calling it God the businessman. Amen. God the businessman. How many God's a businessman? SURE. IF HIS FATHER HAS A BUSINESS, he's got to be a be a businessman. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, in order to run a business, if you're going to be a mason, you got TO BE A GOOD ONE. &gt;&gt; WHAT? He knows. I'm sorry, BUT THEM BRICKS JUST CAN'T STICK OUT EVERY ONCE IN A while in the wall. THE CUSTOMERS SAY, "HEY, WHY IS THAT ONE STICKING OUT?" I'VE LAID I'VE I'm a mason myself. Labored for laid block many many times. But anyway, that's right. YOU GOT TO BASICALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO. I REMEMBER TIM THOMPSON some time ago when we was building his little garage there that he keeps his fancy cars in it and he built a 1960s Chevron station I believe it was or Texico one of those and he had the pumps out there and he built it all and oh just spent Bukus and money on a Texico and me and Micah helped build that thing and he ordered metal and uh you know and and the guy GOT IT WRONG TWICE. NO, I WANT TO I told you what he he was finally and Timmy's a very long-suffering man. One of the best men to work for that I ever worked for. Amen. But he got frustrated with the guy. HE SAYS, "I JUST DO YOUR JOB. JUST DO YOUR JOB. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING." YOU KNOW, if you do your if you're in business, you you got to get it right sometime. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you reading between the lines? Are you listening to me now? How many know that God gets it right? &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And Jesus WAS HERE TO FULFILL THE FATHER'S WILL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. So what is his business? Let me let me stop here. here just a little bit further. Now, if you listen to brother Bannon and what he says about it, he he'll say that this was actually a rebuke to his mother. First of all, his mother absolutely shattered her testimony. And there's another thing that I'm wondering about kind of considering and looking at because a lot of times the Bible calls the mother of god the mother of Jesus. That right there's different places where he calls it and so forth. But brother Brandon brings it out and said that Jesus never called her mother. Never called Joseph his father. Why? Because to be his mother, she would have had to supply A PORTION OF HERSELF, THE EGG. Isn't that right? Amen. And Joseph, in order to be the dad, how many knows that if a woman cheats on her husband, Amen. And and HE EVER HAS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THAT BABY, THEY CAN GET A genetic test and find out whether it is or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND IF YOU WOULD TAKE A GENETICS test of Jesus, YOU'D FIND OUT JOSEPH WAS NOT HIS father and Mary is not his mother. &gt;&gt; Why? THIS IS WHAT BROTHER BRANDON BRINGS OUT THAT THAT SHE WAS NOT. SHE WAS THE INCUBATOR. SHE WAS THE ONE THAT BIRTHED HIM. SHE'S THE ONE THAT MOTHERTHERED HIM, SO TO SPEAK. BUT AS FAR AS BEING THE MOTHER, SHE WAS NOT. CUZ IF THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF IN THERE, YOU WERE IN TROUBLE. I WAS IN TROUBLE. IF THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF JOSEPH in there, you are not redeemed. YOU ARE NOT SAVED BECAUSE THEY WERE BORN OF SIN. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY GLAD THAT HE WAS THE BLOOD OF GOD? It was the GENE SEED OF GOD THAT COME DOWN IN HER. THE HOLY GHOST OVERSHADOWED HER, overshadowed her. But the MAN SAYS SHE TRIED IN FRONT OF THOSE PRIESTS. DIDN'T WANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, THAT IT WAS THE HOLY GHOST CHILD BORN OF THE HOLY GHOST. SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HER TESTIMONY THERE. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. BUT REALISTICALLY, HE WAS CORRECTING HER. I'M ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS, AND IT AIN'T JOSEPH. AMEN. MY FATHER IS GOD, THE PILLAR OF FIRE, THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord. OH, HOW MANY KNOWS THE BEGINNING? HE WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF GOD. THE BIBLE SAYS, AMEN. When that was spoken, he was the beginning that God was creating something. He was going to do A WORK AND JESUS WORK. AMEN. WHEN HE CAME TO PILATE, REMEMBER PILATE SAYS, "I HAVE THE POWER TO LOSE YOU. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE NO POWER UNLESS MY FATHER HAD GIVEN IT TO ME." HE GIVEN IT TO YOU. HE SAYS, "AND HE SAID, UNTO THIS END WAS I BORN. FOR THIS PURPOSE CAME I INTO THE WORLD." HE WAS HERE TO FULFILL SCRIPTURE. FOR THE SCRIPTURE MUST be fulfilled. REMEMBER JOHN THE BAPTIST SAID, "I HAVE NEED OF BEING BAPTIZED OF THEE." AND HE SAYS, "LET IT be so. IT BEHOOVES US." BUT DOES IT BEHOOVES US TO FULFILL ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS? IN OTHER WORDS, FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE. I WANT TO SAY THIS MORNING, HOW MANY SAYS THAT WAY WITH ME? LORD, HELP US. HELP US TO FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for. All right, I'll calm my voice down a little bit. I'm getting a little loud. Huh? &gt;&gt; I get excited. &gt;&gt; I get a little loud. &gt;&gt; I was at a football game, brother Brian, and my favorite win, my favorite team would be throwing a touchdown just to get a hold of the other team. I'D PROBABLY GET UP. YEAH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; HUH. &gt;&gt; That's it. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. Danny Marino, Mark Clayton, Mark Dofer. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember back in my day. It's been 20 years ago. Ain't nobody remember that, Danny. &gt;&gt; But Danny Marino was fat. He could really throw a ball, couldn't he? And boys could really how how they won most of their games. Amen. What's that got to do with the gospel? Let me tell you what's got to do with the gospel. Brother Abraham says, you know, the the world gets excited about its things. And the believer ought to be just as enthused about the things that THEY HAVE OR MORE SO THAN WHAT THEY DO. SO IF THEY THEY GET a little loud, it don't hurt us to GET A LITTLE LOUD. IF THEY GET EXCITED, IT DON'T HURT US TO GET A LITTLE EXCITED. THIS IS TWICE AS EXCITING AS WHAT THEY ARE. They might have spend ALL THEIR TIME AND ALL THEIR money to go to THE GAME ONLY TO WATCH IT JUST TO ABSOLUTELY GET STOPPED AT THE ONE YARD LINE AND HAVE TO GO HOME. OH MAN. GO HOME IN THE agony of defeat. WE ALMOST ONE DAY WHOOPED US. OH MAN. AMEN. But here you don't have to worry about going home today in the agony of defeat. AMEN. AMEN. BUT IN THE THRILL OF VICTORY. AMEN. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Next scripture I want to go to is in St. John. I didn't bring you. I did. Oh man, I left another one on. That's just like me. All right. There we go. All right. So, let me see where you're at. In the meanwhile, when his disciples prayed, saying, "Master, eat." Amen. Next one. But as he sat, BUT HE SAID UNTO THEM, "I HAVE MEAT TO EAT THAT you know NOT OF." THEREFORE SAID THE DISCIPLES ONE TO ANOTHER, HAS ANY man brought him ought to eat? Jesus saith to him, MY MEAT IS TO DO THE WILL OF HIM that sent me. &gt;&gt; How many CAN REPEAT WITH ME? MY MEAT IS TO DO THE WILL OF HIM THAT SENT ME. YOUNG PEOPLE, GOD SENDS YOU HERE FOR A PURPOSE, FOR A REASON. HE'S GOT A WILL FOR YOU. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO LIVE FOR. THAT'S MORE THAT'S BETTER THAN ANY RIBEYE, ANY KIND OF A STEAK. AMEN. IS MORE SATISFYING THAN ANYTHING YOU'LL EVER EAT. Is to be able to accomplish that right there. My meat is to do the will of him that sent me. And to finish the work. &gt;&gt; How many knows in a business everybody got to do a LITTLE WORK? &gt;&gt; IT'S A JOB THAT WE GOT TO DO. HOW MANY BELIEVE WE GOT A JOB TO DO? HOW MANY BELIEVE WE'RE HERE TO FINISH THE JOB THAT GOD STARTED? &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT IS IT TO DO? TO BRING EVERY SON BACK TO GOD. TO BRING RECONCILIATION of his lost children &gt;&gt; to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Next one. Let me see here. Keep on going. All right. Say not ye, there are yet four months, and then COMETH THE HARVEST. BEHOLD, I SAY UNTO YOU, LIFT UP YOUR EYES, AND LOOK ON THE FIELDS, FOR THEY ARE WHITE ALREADY TO HARVEST. And he that reapeth re RECEIVETH WAGES, AND GATHERTH FRUIT UNTO ETERNAL LIFE, THAT BOTH HE THAT SWETH AND HE THAT REAPETH MAY REJOICE TOGETHER. HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO? NEXT ONE. AND HEREIN IS THAT SAYING TRUE? ONE SWEETHTH, another reapeth. I SEND YOU TO REAP, WHEREUPON YE HAVE BESTOWED NO LABOR. OTHER MEN LABORED and are into, and we are entered into their laborers. Laborers. Amen. Boy, that's deep. That's deep. I HAVE SENT YOU to reap WHERE ON YE BESTO BES BESTOWED NO LABOR. HOW MANY KNOWS WHEN JESUS WAS HERE, HE WAS LABORING. HE BECAME A SERVANT. And when you're BORN AGAIN, LET ME TALK TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE BORN AGAIN, WHO HAVE GOT THE HOLY SPIRIT. GOD HAS CALLED YOU INTO HIS SERVICE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE HAS CALLED YOU TO DO A JOB. &gt;&gt; HE HAS BROUGHT YOU INTO HIS BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN JESUS WAS HERE, HE DID HIS BUSINESS AND HE DID IT GOOD. &gt;&gt; He labored. HE WORKED HARD. HE SUFFERED. He paved the way. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES IN NOW WE ARE beneficiaries &gt;&gt; of what he labored for? &gt;&gt; That's right. When you think about it, I guess there's still people in the Philippines and other countries where every Easter they'll go get a whip and they'll whip themselves on the back. They'll lash themselves. People do all kinds of things. In the Catholic religion, they rub on these beads and pray to Mary and do ALL THESE WORKS, DO ALL OF THESE THINGS. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT DOESN'T DO THEM ONE BIT OF GOOD? IF ANYTHING, IT'S AN INSULT TO what Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE HE TOOK YOUR LASHES. HE WENT TO CALVARY. HE PAVED THAT ROAD. HE DID THE WORK. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS RECEIVE IT. JUST COME ON IN AND ENTER IN. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; You received the things that Amen. that that that you DIDN'T EVEN LABOR FOR THAT YOU didn't work for. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. You couldn't DO ANYTHING TO BUY YOUR pay you for your sins. &gt;&gt; For a pure conscience. Amen. He labored so that you and I could HAVE FORGIVENESS. THAT'S THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. That was Christ's business &gt;&gt; was to GO TO CALVARY AND TO PAY FOR OUR DEBT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You think about it and I'm going to stop there. Just go slow, not go so fast. THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS. WELL, let me just pick this right up as it comes to my mind. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT Brother Bam and and Sister Hope or not Hope so much but me? HOW MUCH THEY THE CHILDREN SOMETIMES DIDN'T BARELY KNOW BROTHER BRANDHAM WHEN HE WOULD COME back &gt;&gt; and he had TO REACQUAINT HIMSELF WITH HIM ALMOST SOMETIMES &gt;&gt; HE'D BE GONE SO MUCH SACRIFICE labored &gt;&gt; amen so that you what do you do all you have to do is believe it all you got to do is receive it &gt;&gt; AMEN HOW MANY'S GLAD for that &gt;&gt; Amen Amen. I send you to reap that whereupon you have bestowed no labor. Other men labored. Jesus labored in the father's business in the garden of Gethsemane &gt;&gt; on Calvary. My God, MY GOD, WHY HAS THOU FORSAKEN ME? ALL OF HUMANITY FORSAKEN. Can you imagine having a worldwide ministry with the whole weight of the whole uh world on your shoulders and THEN HAVE ABOUT 12 FOLLOWERS about 12 disciples and in THE END EVEN THEY RUN highway you ain't EVEN GOT THEM LEFT TO STAND WITH YOU. HOW MANY KNOW WHEN CHRIST WENT TO CALVARY, HE WENT ALONE. &gt;&gt; They had all forsaken me. THEY WERE SCARED OF GOING TO THE CROSS. AMEN. Another scripture. No, let me stop. Going to fast. How many enjoys light? How many likes to just come over here and just flip a switch? It's all you got to do. You get to enjoy light. But who was it? Thomas. Isn't that right? EDISON LABOR DAY AND NIGHT. THOUSANDS OF WIRE WORKED HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT'S DONE. AMEN. SO MUCH WENT INTO IT. I don't KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M GLAD THAT WE AIN'T GOT TO GO UP HERE AND CHANGE THEM ALL THE TIME. I GUESS BROTHER BRIAN CHANGED ALL THOSE LIGHTS TO WHAT LED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He's glad that he ain't got to bring that big old LADDER IN HERE AND CHANGE THEM ALL THE TIME. ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT AGAIN. THEY GO BLOWING ALL THE TIME. BUT NOW MY I'VE HAD MINE IN MY HOUSE SEVEN YEARS, I GUESS, AND I STILL AIN'T HAD TO DO WOO! I'M GLAD FOR LIGHTS. &gt;&gt; But yet, I didn't come up with it. I didn't work on it. I didn't figure OUT HOW TO MAKE LEDS, BUT I GET TO ENJOY IT. &gt;&gt; I was going to say, "HOW MANY HOW MANY ENJOY YOUR AIR CONDITIONER IN your vehicle?" &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Well, if I ask them that, they'll say, "Not really right now. I like the heater better. by fixing to tomorrow. If you don't think about it today, in the next few days, we're going to have the old winter back again. Hallelujah. I like cold weather. Amen. I know you want to talk. Say, I like the war. I I hear you. I hear you. But what is it somebody had to figure out so that you can BE COMFORTABLE? I'M glad that Jesus figured IT OUT SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE SOME COMFORT. YOU CAN HAVE THE COMFORT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. AMEN. THAT YOU DIDN'T LABOR FOR IT. JESUS LABORED FOR IT. HE WORKED TO BRING IT TO YOU. WE can do is accept it. &gt;&gt; They've got something called opium now. Amen. I don't know what them P go folks gave my wife one time when her heart was fluttering. It was hurting. I took her in. They couldn't figure out what it was, but they gave her some opium or something. They gave her some good hard drugs. Now, my wife don't do drugs, believe me. One little Tylenol, they'll just do whatever. But they her medicine, she did what the doctor said, and when she got home, she was feeling mighty fine. So much so she laid on some laundry. I said, "HOW YOU DOING?" "OH, I'M just fine." I shouldn't say this. There she is covering her face. Lord help. But that's right. What did they do? THEY COME UP WITH THESE DRUGS. AMEN. TO GIVE YOU SOME SOME SOME ACTUALLY A GOOD FEELING. MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD. IF YOU'RE HURTING, THEY GIVE YOU PAIN MEDICINE. THAT'S RIGHT. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT GOD COME DOWN? AMEN. IN CHRIST AND HE CRUSHED JESUS WHICH WAS THE LILY OF THE VALLEY AND HE BROUGHT US SOME OPIUM SO THAT IF YOU'RE TALKING LOW YOU CAN SAY NO I FEEL JUST FINE IN THIS WORLD OF WICKEDNESS IN THIS WORLD OF TOIL. AMEN. IN PAIN I FEEL FINE. SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE FEELS FINE, TOO. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED MORE OF. AMEN. IT'S THAT opium from the lily of the valley. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY GLAD FOR THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; JESUS WENT TO CALVARY SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; So many things driving our vehicles. I don't know about you, but I like driving a vehicle. And I like driving on paved roads. &gt;&gt; How many like paved roads? &gt;&gt; Amen. When you get your car all cleaned up, I've got a few potholes down the driveway and I try to avoid the potholes. I don't want to get it all dirty. That's right. I mean, know when the Holy Spirit cleans you up real good. WATCH THEM POTHOLES STAY OUT OF THE POTHOLES THAT GET YOU DIRTY. AMEN. GET BEFORE GOD AND STAY CLEAN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IS IT? THOSE FOREFATHERS, LUTHER. AMEN. HE BEGAN TO PUT SOME GRAVEL ON. AMEN. HE BEGAN TO GRADE THE ROAD A LITTLE BIT. AMEN. OH, come Luther. Amen. He graded a little more. And he put A LITTLE MAYBE PUT SOME TILE ON IT TO MAKE SO IT DOESN'T GET ALL DUST. AMEN. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IN OUR DAY, WE'VE GOT A BLACK TOP ROAD THAT'S SMOOTH. IT'S SMOOTH RIDING, FOLKS. YOU AIN'T GOT TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THIS CHURCH, AMEN, CONDEMNS YOU FOR NOT DRIVING A BUGGY OR NOT WEARING A hat or you SPEAK IN TONGUES OR NOT. AMEN. YOU'VE GOT A THUS SAYITH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; You know what's truth. &gt;&gt; You're not confused anymore. &gt;&gt; You're not going down a rough road and they labored. A prophet of God labored &gt;&gt; to bring us a word TO BRING US LIGHT IN the evening time. So many things we enjoy. &gt;&gt; That we hadn't bestowed no labor upon. But we are. How many know? But we have a responsibility. We do have a responsibility this morning cuz we have entered into the labor. Amen. All right. Praise the Lord. My meat is to do the father's will that sent me and to finish the work. Put your name in there. &gt;&gt; How many believes that &gt;&gt; our meat is to do the father's will that sent us AND TO FINISH THE WORK. &gt;&gt; We'll work till Jesus comes. We'll work till Jesus comes. will work till Jesus comes and then we'll be gathered home. &gt;&gt; That's right. We've been called to labor, to work, to testify, to bring this to the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just say it while I'm at. How many knows that the church has been given the commission to carry on the father's business? &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we get into that part, I want to read you another scripture in Luke 4. Now this is Jesus after he uh let me see according to verse 23 of chapter 3 it says and Jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age being as was supposed I like that as was supposed to be the son of Joseph. Amen. Just because he was supposed to be don't mean he was. Amen. But over in chapter 4 and we'll make a long story short. Go down to verse 14. And Jesus returned. This was after the temptation temp when he went up in the mountains was temptation of the devil and so forth. Tempted of him and so forth. Amen. Come back victorious. And when the devil had ended all the temptations, he departed from him for a season. And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit unto Galilee. And there went out a fame of him throughout all the regions round about. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, Amen. You know, that little word custom kind of catches my attention. Brother Bram said, you know, just make it a habit to pray. Make it a habit. Can we say just make it a habit to come to church. &gt;&gt; It's just what you do. It's your custom. &gt;&gt; It may be a little ritualistic or whatever, but it's our custom and that's what we do. &gt;&gt; It was his custom. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for it to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED, to preach deliverance to the captives and the RECOVERING OF THE SIGHT OF THE BLIND." AMEN. How many believe WE NEED SOME SPIRITUAL EYESIGHT? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AND TO SET AT LIBERTY THEM THAT ARE BROKEN IS TO HEAL. AMEN. IS TO FORGIVE. IT'S TO BRING OUT OF THE OUT OF THE PAWN SHOP TO BRING DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES. IF YOU'RE A CAPTIVE, GOD'S STILL IN THE BUSINESS. IF YOU'RE A SINNER, GOD'S STILL IN THE BUSINESS. IF YOU NEED THE REAL FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, GOD IS STILL IN THE BUSINESS. OH, I NEED MORE OF THE HOLY GHOST. GOD IS STILL IN THE BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; I need victory in THE IN MY LIFE. THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. &gt;&gt; WOO! I LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHAT GOD DOES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll say it before I don't. That's what this church is in the BUSINESS FOR. WHAT'S OUR BUSINESS? What do we do? WE LIKE TO PREACH THE GOSPEL. HE SAYS WHEN JESUS COMMISSIONED TO THE CHURCH AND WHEN HE HANDED IT OVER TO THE CHURCH, how many believes that the work, the business was handed over to the church? &gt;&gt; It was given to the church to do. Cuz when Jesus hung on the cross, he said, "My job is done." He said, "It's finished. It's finished. Amen. It's finished. His work here on earth in his body was finished. Amen. On earth. After that, where did he go? Went on down to hell. Went to the grave. Had a little more work to do down there. After he rose up again, he had had to go on up to heaven, sit at the right hand of the father of authority. Amen. &gt;&gt; So no doubt but Jesus opened the eyes of the blind. Is that right? No doubt but that he CALLED LAZARUS BACK FROM THE DEAD. HE RAISED THE DEAD UP. &gt;&gt; OPEN THE EYES of the blind. But there's some things he couldn't do. There's some things Jesus couldn't do. Even though the eyes were open. Amen. Takes spit and open and people be healed and all of that. But there was a much greater work that was to be done. &gt;&gt; And it couldn't be done as long as he was on THE EARTH. THAT'S WHY HE SAID IT'S EXPEDIENT THAT I GO AWAY. We need a little music with the preaching. It'll be all right. BECAUSE IF I DON'T GO AWAY, THE COMFORTER CAN'T COME. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO OPEN YOUR EYES. I MIGHT JUST SAY, "COME UNTO ME." BUT YOU CAN NEVER COME UNTIL MY HOLY SPIRIT COMES DOWN UPON YOU. YOU CAN NEVER OVERCOME SIN. YOU CAN NEVER OVERCOME YOUR NATURE. PETER, YOU'RE CONVERTED. Even he COULDN'T BE CONVERTED. PETER COULDN'T OVERCOME. NO, BECAUSE HE WAS STILL IN THAT FIRST NATURE. GOD CAME TO DO A WORK. &gt;&gt; That is TO GIVE US SOMETHING THAT WE LOST AT THE BEGINNING WHEN ADAM AND EVE WHEN THEY WERE HERE, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SPEAK THE WORD AND CREATE THEIR CHILDREN. But they went THE WRONG WAY. SO NOW IT'S THROUGH CHILDBEARING. AMEN. BUT GOD WAS GOING TO COME DOWN AND HE'S GOING TO START A NEW CREATION. AND HIS BUSINESS WAS TO CREATE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. AMEN. AND IN THAT UPPER ROOM, IT WAS THE FIRST BATCH THAT AMEN. THAT WAS BORN INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; He says when you're converted, feed my sheep. Is &gt;&gt; that right? FEED MY SHEEP. AMEN. WE ALL HAVE A WORK TO DO. &gt;&gt; I never finished my thought on the evening light tabernacle, but my work. How many believe that each one of us has a work? &gt;&gt; God gives us something to do. &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT HE SAID, "PETER, FEED MY SHEEP. FEED MY SHEEP. I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER DONE MUCH MISSIONARY WORK. Tried to maybe try to convert some folks up in OHIO THIS OR THE OTHER, BUT MY CALLING IS TO FEED GOD'S SHEEP. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE I'M DOING WHAT GOD HAS CALLED ME TO DO, AND I WILL DO IT AS LONG AS GOD GIVES ME STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; Feed my sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Called So the point I was trying to make there was that redemption wasn't while brother whether Jesus while Jesus was here on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. We needed the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew how important it was for PETER TO HAVE THE STRENGTH. AMEN. THE NEXT TIME WHEN HE GETS THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. AND THEY'RE FIXED TO CRUCIFY AND HE WALKS OUT OF TOWN. JESUS COMES AND SAYS, "HEY, I'M GOING." HE PASSED HIM, "I'M GOING TO BE CRUCIFIED AGAIN, NOT AGAIN." AIN'T THAT RIGHT? AND PETER WENT BACK AND HE SAID, "HANG ME UPSIDE DOWN. CRUCIFY ME UPSIDE DOWN. I'M NOT WORTHY TO DIE LIKE MY LORD DID." HE WAS A BRAVE SOLDIER THEN. &gt;&gt; SO, let me SAY THIS THAT IT WAS AFTER, AMEN. CHRIST DIED, ROSE AGAIN, WHEN THE REDEMPTION, THE TRUE RECONCILIATION OF THE FATHER, WHAT HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HAPPENED ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. WOO! MAN WAS RECONCILED TO GOD. JESUS BRIDGED THE WAY FOR MAN TO COME BACK TO GOD. AND THEY CAME BACK BY THE DROVES. AND THEY'RE STILL COMING. AND THEY'LL COME UNTIL THAT LAST ONE COMES IN. &gt;&gt; You and I have got the job of trying to find that last one. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Jesus said, "GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE. He that BELIEVETH AND IS BAPTIZED SHALL BE SAVED. HE THAT BELIEVETH NOT SHALL BE DAMNED." AMEN. SO THE CHURCH HAS BEEN THE COMMISSION. WE HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED BY GOD to carry out &gt;&gt; his work. &gt;&gt; 12 times I pulled up that quote where brother Bam says that God gave church. Amen. The business his business. Amen. We're about to do his business. I have one quote here I want to read that brother Brandon made as we go into the next step. Listen, how many know that Jesus came to fulfill the scriptures? He came to do the will of the father that had sent me sent him. Brother B makes a statement. Those in the bride do only his will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still. &gt;&gt; They know it HAS TO BE GOD IN THEM DOING the works, fulfilling his own word. &gt;&gt; AMEN. JESUS SAYS, "I AM THE light of THE WORLD." BUT HE ALSO SAYS, "YE ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD." &gt;&gt; GOD HELP US TO LET OUR LIGHT SHINE. Whose glasses? &gt;&gt; Amen. But Abam says it this way. They know that it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling his own word. Now, he did not complete all his works while in his earthly ministry. Amen. Why? If that had been the case, we'd have altars after Calvary taking us home. But we still needed redemption. We still needed to hear the gospel. &gt;&gt; Me and my wife was talking on the way to church of it just being four days away from being 2026. She said she remembered, and I don't know it was 1977 or not. I'm pretty sure it probably was. She remembers when she was young sitting in some kind of a a room. I forget what she described it as, like a cafeteria or something with a lot of chairs and everybody in the church was there. And as the 12:00 time came, maybe five or so minutes before, everybody just sat there and watched the clock tick. That's what she said. They just sat quiet. Nobody talked. Nobody prayed. He says, "Watch the clock." Tick tock, tick tock. Why? Because how many knows expect people was expecting 1977? The millennium will be here. He predicted it would be all over with. But then, Amen. I thought, you know, I'm sure glad it wasn't. I didn't get saved till 83. How many here would say, I'M GLAD IT WASN'T OVER, Brother Hervin AND MARTHA? I'M GLAD IT WASN'T OVER, TOMMY, TAMMY, TROY. I'M GLAD IT WASN'T OVER. I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT. COME ON, PEOPLE. AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT IT WASN'T? That you could still COME IN, GOD, WITH LONG SUFFERING. I AM SO GLAD CUZ I'D have been lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. The work wasn't done yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; People after the seals were open said, "Should we go preach?" &gt;&gt; WHY, SURE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE Brother Brandon believed in preachers? &gt;&gt; He sure did. AMEN. GO. DON'T STOP. NOW, THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He works. Now, notice. So his EARTHLY MINISTERS KNOW NOW HE WORKS in and through the bride. &gt;&gt; She knows that for it IS WAS NOT YET TIME FOR HIM to do certain things. I mean believes that's the truth. St. JOHN 16:12 SAYS, "I HAVE YET MANY THINGS to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. How be it when he, THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH, IS COME, HE WILL GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH." HOW MANY BELIEVES HE DIDN'T SAY AS MUCH AS HE WANTED TO SAY? &gt;&gt; NO, HE DIDN'T SAY NEAR AS MUCH AS WHAT he wanted to say. &gt;&gt; You know how much he said? You know how much Jesus said? Jesus said Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. About how many knows God needed a Paul? God needed A PAUL THAT COULD SAY THAT ALL SCRIPTURE IS GIVEN BY INSPIRATION OF GOD. IT'S PROFITABLE DOCTRINE FOR REPROVE FOR INSTRUCTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS. AMEN. MAN LIKE PAUL THAT COULD COME AND preach the word OF GOD AND SAY IF ANYBODY COME AND PREACH ANY OTHER GOSPEL THAN THAT WHICH WE HAVE PREACHED IF HE'S AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN. WHY? MORE TRUTH WAS to come. more truth was to come. There was more work to be done. Now notice, it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now do, but he will now fulfill through the bride the work which he left for a specific time. Amen. How many believe you should always be missionary-minded, always reaching out for the lost? God help evening like tabernacle. If the preachers ever get to where they're stagnated and the Holy Spirit's not working anymore, we'll just talk about the robins that come back in the springtime and the nice little flowers or something. Didn't what Brother Bam said churches all they can talk about is some flowers. THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE A MESSAGE. NO, BUT IT TAKES THE FIRE OF THE HOLY GHOST. TO NOT JUST BE HERE, NOT JUST BURN HERE, BUT BURN OUT THERE. I mean, THAT'S WHY WE APPRECIATE THE WORK TOMMY DOES. I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT TO GO, IF I GOT TO GO TO JAIL SOMEWHERE, I'LL CATCH THEM SOMEWHERE AND THEN PREACH TO SOMEBODY IF THEY I GOT TO CATCH HIM BEHIND BARS. I'D LIKE TO DO GO ON THE STREET CORNERS OR WHATEVER. SOMEBODY HEAR THIS. THIS IS SO GOOD. AMEN. HOW MANY BELIEVES IT'LL GO TO ALL THE WAY TO THE END? AMEN. TO ALL THE WORLD. AND WHEN ALL THE PREACHERS, THE CREATURES have heard it, brother Bam says, then the end will come. And when that last one comes in, &gt;&gt; that's why we pray, Lord, lead us, guide us, help us each one. &gt;&gt; Wherever God lights your candle and places, you shine right there. &gt;&gt; You in Scotsville, let Scotsville see your light. Here in Elkton, let let him see your light. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not A PREACHER. GOD TAUGHT ME TO BE A BUSINESSMAN. WELL, BE THE BEST BUSINESSMAN YOU CAN BE. &gt;&gt; God calls you to MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. MAKE A LOT OF MONEY SUPPORTING THE CAUSE, BUT USE IT FOR THE GOSPEL AND FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY. YOU NEVER KNOW. &gt;&gt; GOD CALLED YOU JUST TO MAKE A LITTLE MONEY. MAYBE HE DON'T TRUST YOU WITH ALL OF THAT MONEY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BE HAPPY. BE STAY IN THE CALLING THAT GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO BE. HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT? &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF YOU, I WANT EVERY one of YOU AS YOUR PASTOR. I WANT YOU TO FIND YOUR PLACE AND PLANT YOURSELF THERE AND KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE WILL OF GOD AND SHINE WHERE YOU ARE. We here AT EVENING NIGHT TABERNACLE, WE'RE HERE, AMEN, TO MAKE STRONG FAMILIES, TO MAKE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS, STRONG MARRIAGES, BRING UP YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO GET THEM FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. CAUSE THEM MAYBE TO GET MARRIED IF THAT'S WHAT GOD CALLS THEM TO DO. HAVE CHILDREN AND RAISE THEM IN THE NURTURE AND THE ADMONITION OF GOD. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS FOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. To live for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Never go out in the world. Never smoke. Never drink. Young people. &gt;&gt; STAY AWAY FROM IT. HAVE A TESTIMONY. I'VE NEVER TOUCHED THAT. BY THE GRACE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY BELIEVES IT TAKES A REAL GRACE OF GOD? THAT'S A MORE POWERFUL TESTIMONY. AND HE SAYS, "YES, I WAS IN DRUGS. I WAS IN THIS, THAT, AND GOD, BUT GOD DELIVERED ME." HOW MUCH A GREATER TESTIMONY IF YOU HAD YOUR YOUNG LIFE GIVE YOUR HEART TO GOD AND NEVER EVEN GET INTO IT. SAY, "THAT'S THE POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. That's what we want." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's our business. We're making we we like to for people to have joy. &gt;&gt; How many know that Jesus came that you have joy? &gt;&gt; We want HE WANTS TO HAVE HIS CHILDREN TO HAVE A SMILE ON THEIR FACE. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO BE HAPPY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW GOD WANTS YOU. THAT'S HOW I WANT YOU. THAT'S HOW I WANT TO BE. WHY? THERE'S NO REASON FOR US NOT TO BE HAPPY. NOT TO HAVE JOY. &gt;&gt; All right, let me take another turn. Amen. Let's find out just how God runs his business. How many like to know how God runs his business? And maybe if I have time, we'll get into the little phrase that people will say, "Well, I'm a preacher. You better stay in your own business. Stay out of my business." Huh? Stay out of my business. If I'm in your business, then I'm doing my business. &gt;&gt; I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing. &gt;&gt; Get all up in your business &gt;&gt; cuz God gets all up in our business. That's what God does. &gt;&gt; Give him a hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, watch that phrase, brother. You're meddling now. &gt;&gt; Medddling. &gt;&gt; God likes to meddle. &gt;&gt; Oh, he does. &gt;&gt; He meddles with the way that you have your hair. He meddles with the way that you dress. He meddles with whether you have a smile or not or whether you go all droopy. HE CARES ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; HELLO. SO, I'M GLAD HE MEDDLES. &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD HE CARES. &gt;&gt; I got wrote down here meddling. Well, now you talk about hair. Our sisters and their long hair. Amen. Don't put a census to it. It's a Nazerite vow. He said, "You boys," he says, "don't act like the Beatles. Don't have these hair hanging down in your face where all you got to always just fling it, fling it, fling it, fling it like some girl." He said &gt;&gt; like the Beatles did. They had these these this hair down in their eyes. Brother Brandham hated that. He said, "It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit." Amen. That's how they had it. Don't act like a girl. Don't have hair like a girl. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Preaches on our shoes we wear. My He even cares how big a heels we got. He cares about that. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he don't WANT YOU TO WALKING AROUND LIKE THIS LIKE the harlots do out on the street. &gt;&gt; We won't even get into why they do that. &gt;&gt; Be too vulgar. Hello. &gt;&gt; But it's a vulgar thing that they do that. SO THAT'S WHY HE SAYS THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO DO THAT. SORRY, BUT HE PUT IT ON THE SCRIPT. &gt;&gt; That's right. AND OF COURSE, WE DON'T BELIEVE IN WEARING PANTS AROUND HERE. &gt;&gt; NO, WE DON'T DO THAT. BUT GUESS WHAT? WE GOT TO CARE. BE CAREFUL. HE SAYS, MAN, YOU GET THAT SKIRT WHERE YOU FEEL AMEN. like you're you got the skin of a I call it the skin of a wiener. &gt;&gt; That's right. HOW MANY KNOWS A HOT DOG? AMEN. IT'S GOT SOME TIGHT SKIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Look like you're some wiener, you know, or whatever. That's bad, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or all those things you say, well, you know, THOSE ARE NO, GOD CARES ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK. YOU REPRESENT HIM, &gt;&gt; NOT SOME STREET WALKER. &gt;&gt; Ain't that the truth? GOD CARES ABOUT WHETHER YOU GO TO CHURCH OR NOT. BROTHER BAM SAYS, you know, I said, you know, SOME PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE REALLY CARE ABOUT WHETHER THOSE DOORS ARE OPEN OR NOT. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, THOUGH? THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO OPEN TO GET OUT OF HERE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; WHEN'S THAT PREACHER GOING TO QUIT? THIS HAS BEEN TOO LONG, MAN. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM DOORS TO OPEN. IT'S JUST THE WRONG KIND. AMEN. YOU OUGHT TO BE SAYING, "I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO OPEN, TO GET INTO THEM, NOT TO GET OUT OF THEM." I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT OF HERE, YOU BETTER TAKE TRIP TO THE ALTAR and get A LITTLE TASTE OF this thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT DOES IT SAY? WHENEVER YOU GET SUFFER FOR THE S FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST, AMEN. AMEN. REJOICE AND LEAP FOR JOY. &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I THOUGHT I THOUGHT I MIGHT DO THIS, BUT I DON'T GUESS I WILL.

HE SAYS, "DON'T NEVER LOSE THAT INSPIRATION. ALWAYS CLAP YOUR HANDS. ALWAYS SING TO THE LORD. SING THEM OLD GOSPEL SONGS." AMEN. NEVER LOSE IT. HOW MANY KNOWS it's so easy to lose it? &gt;&gt; THOSE CHURCHES HAVE LOST IT. CAN I SAY EVENING LIGHT TABERNACLE? WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE IT. NO. FROM WEDNESDAY TO SUNDAY, SOMETIMES WE GET A LITTLE BACKSLID. &gt;&gt; HELLO. BUT IT'S NOT TIME TO DO THAT. NO. STAY in fervent prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The father's business. Are you kidding me? I am his business. &gt;&gt; You are his business. &gt;&gt; We're his business. &gt;&gt; He's in the soulsaving business. &gt;&gt; He's in the redeeming business. He's in the joybringing business. HE'S IN CLEANSING BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. We never COME UP WITH THAT BLEACH THAT WE GET ALL OUR SPOTS OUT OF IN OUR CLOTHES. AND WE NEVER come up with the bleach THAT WASHES US WHITE AS SNOW. BUT WE ARE THE BENEFICIARIES. ALL WE GOT TO DO IS RECEIVE IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. All right, let's make that turn that I talked about for a minute. Brother Bam says the hidden life with Christ. He says, "May I stop just a moment and realize that I'm facing clergymen, smart man. But I'd like to say this. I know and I believe this and I know it that Jesus never went to the cross and died for some haphazard affair." &gt;&gt; I like that. Amen. And how many believes that I may get into it maybe Sunday I don't know but we could maybe talk about God the architect. How many know he's architect brother he's I got a quote here says that brother brother said that God is a contractor. &gt;&gt; He is a contractor. He's a businessman. Amen. And in order to and he's a builder. I want to say he's a builder. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY IT'S GOD THAT BUILDS? AMEN. &gt;&gt; He's a builder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got time? &gt;&gt; I got word. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, Jesus never went to the cross for SOME HAPHAZARD AFFAIR. PERHAPS MAYBE SOMEBODY MIGHT FEEL SORRY BECAUSE HE DIED IN such a terrible way and so they'll COME AND GET SAVED. GOD DOESN'T RUN HIS BUSINESS LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; GOD RUNS HIS BUSINESS BY FORNOWLEDGE. KNOWING BEFORE THE WORLD WAS EVER FORMED WHO WAS his who's his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. SEE, IN THE CHURCH, YOU DON'T GET VOTED OUT OR voted in. YOU'RE BORN ONCE for eternity, &gt;&gt; FOREVER. ONLY GOD COULD PUT YOU OUT. HE SWORE AND HE SWORE BY HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NEVER DO IT. How many's glad for a business like that? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful. All right. He knows. Amen. He knows what you're made out of before he brings you in. &gt;&gt; OH MY. THAT JUST IF THE DEVIL EVER COMES TO YOU AND TRIES TO TELL YOU, "NO, I'M NOT ONE OF GOD'S CHILDREN. NO, I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH. OH, LOOK AT MY FAILURES." YOU REMEMBER THIS. GOD WOULDN'T CALL YOU. HE WOULDN'T BRING YOU IN IF HE WASN'T ABLE TO KEEP YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're made out of. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before he brings you in, he don't run his business loosely like our organizations do. Well, coach, come and join church. Put your name on the book. Come here, Michael. Just come, man. You know, just come put your name on the book, shake the preacher's hand. All right, you're officially saved. I mean, you're part of the church and you're going to heaven. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? Would you accept that? &gt;&gt; Just because you shook the preacher's hand. &gt;&gt; No. Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; No. No. I like what brother Bram WHEN HE PREACHED. HE MUST BE BORN AGAIN. NOT JUST SHAKE THE PREACHER'S HAND. YOU'VE got the boohoo. YOU'VE GOT THE CRY. YOU GOT TO PICK YOUR WAY OUT OF THAT EGG. AMEN. UNTIL THERE'S A BIRTH THAT COMES OUT. &gt;&gt; OH, here we go. We must might as WELL PREACH. AMEN. THINK ABOUT IT. HE SAID, YOU KNOW THAT EGG. AMEN. AMEN. BEFORE THAT LITTLE HEN, BEFORE THERE'LL EVER BE ANYTHING TO PICK, AMEN. TO MAKE ITS WAY OUT. AMEN. THAT HEN HAD TO BE THE ROOSTER. WOO. OR there'll never be. It won't BE NOTHING BUT A ROTTEN EGG. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BETWEEN A LITTLE BEAUTIFUL PEE PEEP TO COME OUT OF THAT EGG. AMEN. AND NOTHING BUT BREAKING THAT THING OPEN. OO. BUT SAYS IN OUR CHURCHES TODAY, WHAT THE problem is, WE'VE GOT TOO MANY ROTTEN EGGS. IT'S TIME TO GETTING RID OF THE ROTTEN EGGS. AMEN. GET SOMEBODY UP IN HERE. AMEN. THAT'S FERTILE. THAT'S KNOWN GOD. MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE HALLELUJAH. YOU HAVE MORE. PRAISE GOD. AMENS. YOU'LL HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST THAT WON'T BE MEAN TO YOU WHEN THEY GET OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH. WON'T STEAL AND LIE AND CHEAT AND TALK BAD ABOUT YOU WHEN THEY GET OUT OF CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WON'T BACKBITE. &gt;&gt; WON'T MAKE A ABSOLUTE HADES FOR THE PASTOR &gt;&gt; and claim to be born again. make all kinds of trouble for the pastor, just absolute Hades, &gt;&gt; and then go around the church. Oh, this person isn't quite right. And I'm thinking, oh, God, if you only knew how unright you are. &gt;&gt; Why are you worried about this little motence in somebody's eye when you got a beam in your own? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. LET'S GET THE BEAM OUT OF OUR OWN EYE. &gt;&gt; THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE PROPERLY AND YOU'LL APPROACH IT RIGHT. &gt;&gt; He won't force your way into it and do all kinds of crazy stuff. &gt;&gt; Well, anyway, &gt;&gt; you love him. &gt;&gt; All right, let's get down to business. Now, I have one more point I want to make, and we certainly will be looking like we're going to go into two or three part two or three parts. Amen. God don't run his business habazard. &gt;&gt; I am so glad for that. &gt;&gt; I I love this quote. &gt;&gt; I LOVE THE FACT THAT GOD WOULD NOT CALL ME in if he didn't see what I was made of first. Uh, should I just say what comes to my mind? &gt;&gt; Cuz see, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO FORWARD, BACKWARDS, up or down, or whichever way, but I know what just kept me there. Just stand having done all to stand. Just stand there &gt;&gt; committed to God. And I'm here as a witness along with brother Bam. He says, "Every son of God comes to this place. God will bring us all to a place we just can't can't DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN DO. WE JUST CAN'T DO NOTHING ABOUT IT." &gt;&gt; Then he wants to see how you act. &gt;&gt; Will you just get on your knees and say, "God, I don't I don't know what to do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm giving it to you, God. It's all yours. PEOPLE WANT TO GO CREATE, GO CRAZY. I'M WAITING ON GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I am waiting ON GOD. DO THIS, DO THAT, DO WHAT YOU WANT, BUT I'm waiting on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe God bring us to those places. &gt;&gt; And if he's you're made out of the right stuff, you won't go by the wayside. &gt;&gt; No. Even if you do, how many knows you will come back? How many is that way? Lord, I Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't do so good. BUT I COME BACK TO GOD. I GIVE MY HEART BACK TO GOD EVEN AFTER ALL THAT I HAVE WENT THROUGH. And I speak to people this morning right now that's got deep scars because of what I'm saying. I have deep scars from those things. But how many believe I thank God the scar may there but he healed it &gt;&gt; and it feels good. Thank God for his healing. HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE MADE OUT OF. OH, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT COME TO CHURCH AND JUST GET UNDER THE ANOINTING. They can get the anointing ON THEIR FLESH AND IN THEIR SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, OH, SURE, THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT GO BY THE WAYSIDE. THOSE COME DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS. BUT IF GOD EVER REDEEMS YOU, IF HE EVER BUYS YOUR SOUL, YOU ARE HIS FOR TIME AND ETERNITY. THIS CONTRACTOR, THIS MAN, THIS BUSINESSMAN. AMEN. HE DOES NOT GO BANKRUPT. HE DOES NOT LOSE HIS BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; God does not lose his business. He said, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they might perish." They shall never perish. THEY SHALL NEVER PERISH, AND NEITHER SHALL ANY MAN PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY HAND. WOO! HOW MANY IS GLAD TO BE IN A MASTER'S HAND? AMEN. THE BUSINESSMAN'S GOT YOU IN HIS HEAD. NOTHING'S GOING TO PLUCK YOU OUT OF HIS HAND. &gt;&gt; NOTHING'S GOING TO SEPARATE YOU FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. My father which GAVE THEM ME IS GREATER THAN ALL AND NO MAN is able to pluck them out of my father's hands. ANOTHER PLACE HE SAYS ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS GIVEN ME WILL COME TO ME AND I WILL LOSE NONE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY IS GLAD he's not going to lose you? All right, I'm going to avoid some of that and go down here. Brother Brandham in a prayer line. The lady suffers with an extreme nervous condition. Now, we're going to talk about a spirit of sadness for a minute. Amen. And also the way that God does things. He says extreme nervous condition. And then she's wanting prayer for her eyes, too. Getting dimmer and dimmer. They're going out. It's a hardening of the nerve in the eye. The optical nerve is dying, which is shutting off light. But you'll be all upset about something and you're weary. I see you shake your head or something in a pray. You even wonder sometimes if you're actually saved, you'd have trouble with that. That's true. You doubted your experience of being saved. But listen to these precious words. But I'll tell you now, you are. &gt;&gt; How would you like to have a father tell you that? Amen. &gt;&gt; You might think you're not, but I'm here to tell you you are. &gt;&gt; But this is caused by a call. Some kind of a shock. You've had some news or something that shocked you all at once that caused this. I It was the death of your husband last fall. God bless your heart, lady. He says, "Let's move the sadness. Everything will be all right. Merciful God, as I stand before this dear woman and knowing that there is a sad spirit around her, I ask for thy divine mercy and guidance. Laying my hands upon her, I charged that sad spirit to leave the woman. Christ lives. Christ Christ can no more take the word back that he said that he said than nothing because he's God and he knows everything before he says it. And I condemn the spirit that would harm this woman in Jesus' name. Amen. I just want to talk. I just want to ask you uh it was something you was worried about backsliding or something like that. He's talking to her now. something on that order. Well, let me tell let me uh tell about your experience. Look, sister, this may hurt a little bit to the audience. And if you don't believe this, I'm talking to this woman. See, God don't run his business like that. Now, you know you WERE ONCE SAVED. YOU KNOW THAT. WELL, if God saved you here knowing he's going to lose you down the road, then he defeats his own purpose. He can't lose you. He might even have to TAKE YOU OFF THE EARTH BECAUSE OF YOUR SIN. But he can't lose you. YOU'RE HIS. BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN, HE ordained you to eternal life. And it's the devil trying to cheat you OUT OF IT. CALL HIM A LIAR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY SAY, "GOD, I DON'T NEVER WANT TO HAVE A SAD SPIRIT. DEVIL, YOU'RE A LIAR. DON'T TELL ME I'M NOT SAVED. DON'T TELL ME I'M NOT FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST." &gt;&gt; WHY? Because he said later on talks about he said he put your name. God put YOUR NAME ON THAT BOOK, LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE FROM THE foundation of the world. This is where we get into the ar architect part. Folks, I'm here to tell you just a little little maybe when you have a a plan. How many knows God's got a plan? In order to be a builder, you got to have a plan and you follow that plan. Amen. In this natural world, they'll mess up on those plans. If you're a good builder, you'll say, "Well, that architect messed up right here. That'll never fit in there. He says that's those are the numbers, but they don't add up." Then you got to adjust the best you can. Hello. Maybe in the denominational ages we had to do that. Well, we did the best we can. That's all we knew. But now we've got a plan. How many's glad for? Thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. Stay with the word of God. AMEN. BROTHER BO, TELL ME WHAT THE PROPHET TAUGHT. TELL ME WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES. WE DON'T WANT A WHOLE LOT OF YOUR own input. If you have your own ideas, you better TELL ME AHEAD OF TIME. THIS IS YOUR THOUGHT. &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; How many's glad for that? Lord, help us. That sad spirit. Amen that she had. But God is still in the in the business. &gt;&gt; How many believes he will be &gt;&gt; until he gets off that mercy seat? He's be going to be in the business of calling people. Come, come, come, come to me. All you who are weary and heavy laden. NO. WHEN HE SAID THAT, I'D LOVE TO HEAR THAT. WOULDN'T YOU? WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO BACK AND HEAR HOW BROTHER HOW JESUS said it? I don't know. He said, "Come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Maybe that was more the way he said it, but Thomas Ber says, "Come, COME ALL YOU ARE WEARY AND HEAVY LADEN." HOW MANY KNOWS? IT'S THE SAME HOLY SPIRIT STILL SPEAKING TODAY. WHEN YOU TELL THEM, HEY, ACTS 2:30 SAY, ACTS 2:30 IS STILL THE WAY. COME GET BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, IT'S STILL THE VOICE OF GOD THROUGH THE BODY continuing to work. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; And distributing that same healing. How many believes that? That's why our ministry is healing. We're not here to separate people. We're not here to harm you. We're here to bring healing. We're here to bring forgiveness of your sins. We're here to bring not hate, but love. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; I will have mercy. Jesus said, "That's my message." Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many is glad that you are part of the father's business? &gt;&gt; And we all would all say, "I want to do be about my father's business. That's to get as many as the lost in as we can. &gt;&gt; Amen. I heard brother Bam talk about the mailman, the neighbor, whoever it is that you can be a light to. Try to shine light to others. God bless you. Stand. Musicians, if you'll come. I ain't a preacher, but I'll tell you what gift that God has given me. And when you pray for me, I let myself go. The Holy Spirit can preach. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; So, I want to say thank you for praying for me. How many enjoyed this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you what. When I got Lord just begin to pour that out. Amen. Got to share one more thing. You know, I talked about how that some maybe can't wait for the doors to open. You know, but we're supposed to be Amen. the presence of God. What Jesus' business is to do is to make us thick like molasses. Ain't that right? Amen. like that molasses that just flows and you you wait on that molasses to come on. Come on, man. It's so thick. It's so slow. That's how we're supposed to be when we leave here. Oh, we can't hardly get away from one another. You know, I I don't want TO LEAVE. BUT ABRAHAM SAID WE OUGHT TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER SO MUCH. WE CRY WHEN WE LEAVE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE EACH OTHER FOR FOUR OR FIVE DAYS. &gt;&gt; Who's cried leaving uh the church lately? Good question. Ain't it? I know you ain't going to lie. That's why your hands stay down. Nope. Nope. I can't raise them either. That shows us, hey, maybe we can grow a little bit, love one another a little more. Amen. That's how it ought to be. Not hurrying out the door or whatever, but loving to be around one another. We're brothers and sisters. Brother Bryant Sette, it's been a long road. All of us that's journeyed here for the last 30 years. It's been a long road, but we thank God. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Because we're not looking at another five years here. We're looking at going to the other side. How many's looking forward to going to the other side? &gt;&gt; Having a Do we have a 20-year-old Gersham? How old are you? &gt;&gt; 18. You're young. Too young to get married. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; No, you're not. I'm just picking at you. They're 18. I didn't know you're that young. That's all right. We're going to be 18 to 20. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; The splendor of youth. &gt;&gt; We're looking forward to it. That's not a myth, folks. &gt;&gt; How many believes God has the job? God has got a job. &gt;&gt; Oh, I didn't get into it. We'll get into it maybe Tuesday. And that is Oh, to have us ready. How many believes it's God's job to have you ready? &gt;&gt; Sure.

Your Bible is your will and you wrote our names on the book of life. We are in your will, Lord. And we're so grateful and how happy we are.

And we're so grateful, Father, for it. We ask God that you'd help us each one. Lord, each one of us. I can't do what somebody else's work is. I can't take Tommy's work. He can't take my work. We can't take each other's business work over. No, you call us all to do something, Lord. And we ask God this morning with our hands raised saying, "Help me to do my job better.
