TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] e [Music] I [Music] okay [Music] morning let's stand children can be dismissed to Sunday school brother ban can you open us in a word of Prayer okay let's open our Bibles to Psalms 145 I will extol thee my god oh King and I will bless thy name forever and ever great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable [Music] I will speak of the Glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous Works they shall abundantly user thy M the memory of thy great goodness and shall sing of the righteousness the Lord is great to all and his Tender Mercies are over all his Works they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and and talk of thy power thy kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and thy Dominion endureth throughout all generations the eyes of all wait upon thee and thou givest them their meat in due due season the Lord is righteous in all his ways [Music] and he will fulfill the desire of them that fear Him He also will hear their cry and will save them this one together my mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord and let All Flesh bless His holy name forever and ever God bless you brother brother Brian if you turn with with me to uh First Kings the 8th chapter know I was uh sitting in my study this morning and I was just thinking with with everything that goes on in the world and everything that we see with in the world you're seeing out there in a natural sense what happens when there's a lack of true leadership whether it's governmental leadership whether it's Church leadership what you see out there in the world going on this morning is what happens when there isn't real leadership in the world and it's no different in the Church of God there isn't real God inspired leadership the world world is you'll be in chaos and the world is in chaos this morning but I was just thinking uh if you starting about the about the 30th verse here this is where uh Solomon is dedicating the temple and they hadn't had an experience with the Lord in hundreds of years they hadn't had an experience like this with the Lord since the time of the Tabernacle in the wildness with Moses when the actual spirit of God came down and blessed the temple where the people couldn't even Minister but this is the scriptures that Solomon gave to the children of Israel and these scriptures have changed this word of God is just as effective today for the people in Israel this morning as it was for them 4,000 years ago but I'll just read this is what Solomon had to say and he this is been inspired through Solomon he says and he goes on to say here I said about the 30th verse you know me I have a tendency to read too much but then it's not my word it's God's word hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy People Israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou in heaven Dwelling Place when thou hearest forgive so he's telling the children of Israel when they're in times of great distress great problems in their Liv they to look toward the temple to God's temple in a physical sense and pray and believe to God for deliverance it's the same today if if they would do what all the children of Israel did for thousands and thousands of years God will give them Deliverance to hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant and to the people of Israel when they shall pray to other place and hear thou in heaven thy Dwelling Places when thou hearest forgive and if any man trespassed against his neighbor and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear oath come before thine alter in this house then here in heaven and do and judge the servants condemning the wicked bring bring his way upon his head justify and righteous to give him according to the righteous and and he goes on I'm not going to read the and he goes but this thir third verse speaks to today when the people of Israel be SP down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy People Israel and bring them again onto the land which thou gavest them onto their fathers I'm not I I have to catch myself I wind up reading the whole whole thing and I was just thinking this morning without without faith there there's no hope for us this morning without faith in Jesus Christ I mean there's there's nothing you can count on out there in the world there's nothing really you can hold on to the only thing you can hold on to his faith in Jesus Christ this morning and as you know I know I say this a lot I I don't mean to say this a lot but in the world that we live in this morning if you're trusting in anything out there in that world this morning then you're going to be a miserable person on that day but what it does for me is I realize allows me to examine myself and to realize that we might just have I know we've anyone my age or younger or older has heard it for 40 50 60 70 80 years you know that he's he'll be here tomorrow he'll be here the next day and we live each day knowing that he'll be here tomorrow and be here the next day but what that quote saying this morning brother bram's quote about how the church in his day had seen so many great Miracles and seen so much of what God had done in their lives that they were getting complacent even in front of all the Miracles they were Bec in complacent and that's where we don't want to be this morning and I I'll just read this chapter in John um the Epistle of John the first Epistle of John the thir chapter and also the devotional this morning uh that if that old devotional well it's not old one that's been we've had for years it also goes back to Philippians chapter 4 but I'll just read what brother John had to say this morning behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not and that's the same thing out there in the world this morning they don't they don't know the Lord but you do know the Lord and the only thing way they're going to see the Lord is through your life this morning beloved now are we the sons of God and doth not yet appear that we shall be what we know what when we shall appear we shall be like him for he shall see him as as he is and that's everyone's hope this morning goes on to say and every man that hath this hope and him purify himself even as he is pure so that's what each of us is doing this morning that's why we're here this morning that God could look into our hearts look into our lives this morning and make not you can't make yourself better but he's going to make you better this morning I hope I lose my place here and whosoever committed in Trust transgresses also the Lord for the sin is the transgression of the Lord and you know that he was manifest to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinth not and whosoever sinth hath not seen him neither know him so I I can only speak for myself but if you find yourself this morning after reading this six verse doing things that you know are contrary to the word of God and you have to apply myself including have to apply this scripture to myself this morning goes on to say let oh children let no man deceive you he that do righteousness is righteous even as sth from the G for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil and whosoever is born of God that not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and that's my hope this morning he cannot sin because he's born of God and this children of God are manifested in the children of the devil who whosoever do not righteous this is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so Paul um excuse me John is telling us here as we examine ourselves through these scriptures I'm reading this morning every individual here this morning knows where you're at and that's other and I don't have a lot to say this morning but I was just thinking this morning you know we live in I'm not saying that there isn't problems where we live you know in this whe it's Todd County or Christian County sometimes As Americans we don't realize how life can change so fast and so quickly where you can go from a a minute of being in a peaceful environment from being in an environment where everything around you was fall falling apart we that's what that quote talks about it happens in the church not receiving fresh Revelation from the word of God you're not staying with the word of God that you get so restful so that you're not striving to do better each day and what I was thinking this morning we have no hope in this world this morning as you what's going on in Israel this morning what's going on in Ukraine what's going on all over the world us As Americans we're no better than anyone else in the world doesn't mean that it couldn't happen to you tomorrow so what I'm trying to say this morning outside of your relationship with Jesus Christ this morning what's really important this morning maybe I'm not saying that your family isn't important to you but the most important thing for every individual here this morning and for myself is not to become complacent in the age that we're living this morning that you have to strive in faith to be close to the Lord every morning because you know you could wake up tomorrow and the United States could be in Revolution too and then what are you going to be trust in you going to be trust in your government you're going to be trusted in your state who are you going to be trusting in well we all know our only trust is in Jesus Christ this morning so what I'm trying to say is as long in this 21st century I'm I realize that there's no hope in the in the world that we live in and I sometimes As Americans we have a false sense of security this morning what you see going on in the world could happen here tomorrow too so you have to live each day I know it's hard some people that all they've ever known is the you know most Americans all they ever know is little town or maybe the state they lived in and it's hard to for them to Fathom how things can change so quickly but what I'm trying to say this morning no matter what happens if your faith is residing in Jesus Christ this morning the world can fall apart around you to you and your relationship this morning brother David the Lord this morning amen amen let's stand this morning if we could and sing that little chorus I Love You Lord and I lift my voice this morning amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen we have several out this morning but just appreciate each and everyone that's here

Saints I probably sung this here before I can't remember we're here so much now but this is a song that I always associate with the Welsh Revival brother BR mentioned that a lot you remember when the Americans went over to Wales to find out about the rails Revival and he talks about the little policemen that they got off the ship the first guy I saw was the policemen and they asked him where's the Welsh Revival and he says I am the Welsh Revival you've arrived and brother B would quote that so often but the Welsh Revival this song's tied to me because history started in 1904 at a little uh young people's meeting is where that Revival broke out and there was a young lady there named Annie Evans and this was 1904 but it was just a testimony meeting with young people and she stood up and said I just want to say that I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart and that was said with such conviction she was a new convert that that's what spawned that great Revival just a little single girl there in Wales my Jesus I love these always tie these together my Jesus I love thee I know Thou Art mine for the hoies of sin I resign my graceous redeem my savior art thou If Ever I Lov thee my Jesus

Lord knowing god that you are here in the midst of us Lord father and how grateful we are for that Lord Jesus above everything else that uh that we enjoy Lord Jesus that's what we enjoy most is just being with you Lord to talk with you and to walk with you Lord Jesus like Enoch walked Lord Jesus and we do believe God one of these days we just won't be anymore Lord because you'll have taken us father what a wonderful thought God we ask Lord Jesus as we prepare for that moment Lord and as we have come once again and assembled ourselves together in Your Name Lord to search your hearts to present ourselves before you to see whether we're Faith to search out our own salvation with fear and trembling Lord we ask God that look at every heart May every heart father search their own Hearts this morning Lord and see if they're in the faith or not Lord and what if we are what we should be Lord bless meditation of our heart and that which we feel Lord You've laid Upon Our Hearts to speak on we ask God that you'll just have your way in Jesus name amen and amen we'll just get into the word this morning amen I um want and I will call this amen um um part two of the overview of a Christian an overview of a Christian and basically we're going to amen just look at what it means to be a Christian amen and um I don't have the quote I didn't bring my quotes this morning so I had to pull a few up but it kind of stemmed off of that quote brother Brandon made about he says I just don't know what I would do if I wasn't a Christian he I believe he made this sement I think I'd go crazy or something something I'd go wild I believe the word was wild I'd go wild I mean if I wasn't a Christian seeing all these things that's happening ain't that right seeing all these things that's happening knowing you know that is all coming to an abrupt end father what what would you do if you wasn't the Christian then he also makes a statement he says I don't see any reason why anybody wouldn't want to be a Christian amen why would a person not want to be a Christian amen and so we want to talk about what how blessed we are just to be a Christian amen I believe that when you are a Christian you are the most blessed person upon the face of the Earth you're more blessed than the siks the James the Muhammad Buddha any other religion in the world they're not even close to compared to as blessed is what you are if you're a Christian amen so hallelujah amen I've been a Christian since I was 20 years old I'm about 62 now and I'm very happy to be a Christian I'm glad that I have been a Christian most of my life amen except for the first 20 year 18 years amen that was a big waste of time amen the only time worth anything is the time that you get to spend with God Amen so God bless you this morning we just want to take our time amen we want to take it slow and easy I wrote down here slow and easy you know the thought that came with slow and easy was brother bam said that Jesus was never in a hurry so let's take it slow and easy and not be in hurry about this amen and we get more amen amen don't let's not eat like I do at home gobble it up a that right take it slow Savor the flavor amen praise the Lord God bless you this morning it's good to be a Christian this morning amen and I don't know uh you know we could take a month of sermons or more than this Amen on this but amen we'll just go as long as we possibly can enjoying what God has given is that right and we want to turn our Bibles right back to the same chapter or and the same verse pretty much am mean where we started off with and that's Genesis 1 amen amen how many knows the word of God is eternal Amen brother B says man you can just take one scripture I guess I believe he said it if I remember one talking about you can take one scripture on it for for many many many years amen and I think this is just an example uh of that we're going to take just the first five verses this morning in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night amen and in the evening and in the morning were the first day may God add blessings to his reading of the words you can be seated you know I was back there studying just before I came out amen and I thought you know uh there where God said you know and God called the light day amen how many believes that we're of the light if we are of the light then we are day people right we're day people not night people and then I got to thinking of a scripture God just kind of quickened the scripture to me amen and that was found over in U way over in the book of Thessalonians SE uh Thessalonians and I'll just read this what Paul said here he says now you know we're day people not night people in verse chapter 5 verse 5 he says ye are all the children of light amen and the children of the day amen isn't that something how God will just use and and speak amen how to we're typed here as being day people and uh day people of the day and not of not we are not of the night nor of Darkness amen therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night how many beli the world out there is sleeping they're fast asleep how many knows when the bridegroom came amen there was a shout that went up get up and midnight out wake up how many believes it's time for the world to wake up amen especially the Christian to wake up realize where we're at amen sleeping and uh notice therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunken in the night I believe a prophet even said you know roaches and all of these bugs and even Jesus mentioned that you know how that you know we're not of the darkness we're not creatures of the darkness you know and he's at the nightclubs and all of that I believe he said one place he see know people that think they're alive and living and they go out at night and say boy this is the life no that's not life that's the night life is death is that right so now he says but let us who are of the day amen how many believes we're of the day amen be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we sleep or whether we are awake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do amen praise the Lord another scripture amen is found in Ephesians and I want to just go talking about how that read another scripture and came in talk about how that we are a new creation God created the heavens and the Earth amen and then we know that through Jesus Christ in the New Testament amen Christ was the beginning of the creation of God isin't that right amen we're part of that new creation how many believes that you're a new creature in Christ amen all things have passed away behold all things have become new now notice in Ephesians Darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light amen for the fruit of the spirit in all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving what is acceptable in the Lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame to even speak of those things which are done of them in secret amen so Paul says there's some things that you don't shouldn't even talk about don't even mention it it's so terrible it's so filthy you don't even want to think about it you don't want to hear it amen oh on he says but all things that are approved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light amen amen how many know Jesus said he said they don't want their Works made manifest because they're of Darkness they hate truth because truth sheds light on Darkness if you come to church you're in the wrong place if you like to hide sin if you like to do evil and so far they in the wrong place because that this is where those things are made ma manifest amen this is where we want amen but he talks about he that is of the light light loves the light because so that his deeds might be made manifest that they're righteous amen so now notice here all right now whatever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest I didn't even realize these two went together that well but it says awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead amen and Christ shall give thee light amen what I want to speak on I really want to talk about amen about three different things amen this morning with the help of the Lord amen one of them is going to be amen what it means to have that experience on the backside of the desert amen and then the other one I want to talk about being not dismayed amen and I want to talk about the an of the Soul amen talking about a Christian amen and we realize and I talk Wednesday we talk about how how and now just noce listen to this he says no man has a right to preach the gospel amen no person has a right to call themselves a Christian until they can go back to that certain place in their life where come on that sacred Sands at the backside of the desert amen the backside of the desert and I thought well now you know we realize that's figuratively speaking unless of course you live in Arizona amen and you actually have a literal backside of the desert experience out there and you meet God on the back side of the desert because we know Moses was on the backside of the desert and that's where he got his experience with God amen but you know you know and he talks about how that and I want to I want to try to just follow the leading of the spirit because we want to talk first about am me talking about what it really mean to have that experience on the back side of the desert because it in uh uh uh it encumbers I guess it would say encumbers so much there is so much involves amen all right knows that he has met God I you to get this sacred Sands at the backside of the desert when he meets God face to face amen there's not enough devils in hell that can take that ever take that away from him then Wednesday night we got to talking about how that he makes a statement when brother B preach possessing all things amen and he talked about all the gates that the Seed of Abraham shall possess the gates of the enemy and it tells it's actually a promise of God thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy amen he says now no listen if you really are a Christian there's not enough devils in Hell Amen to keep you from possessing every gate of the enemy glory and let me tell you something as I talk about how that you you talking there's a lot of devils out there there's not enough reinforcements in hell to stop a real Christian there wasn't enough chariots in Egypt to stop Pharaoh from getting those people delivered was there amen it didn't matter if he was a superpower praise be to God why because he had a real experience with almighty God and that's what it takes a born again experience how many knows that's what that means amen having an experience with with God on the back side of the desert it means that you have met God and not only met God because we know that uh uh you know you know that every time you come to church amen you either you go you leave a different person everybody that come to church goes out those doors a different person it's either better or it's worse amen and when you come in contact with almighty God something happens oh he touched me he touched me and oh my something happened and now I know he touched me amen and he made me whole oh my you know can meet God you can meet God Amen and go away a lot worse person not always a better person Young Ruler he was not the same after he met him he was never the same amen Cain was never theice he was never the same you'll never be the same when you hear hear the truth folks oh my how many knows we as human beings young people you know might think you're just going to have a good time you're going to live like this after the other I'm free from God I don't have to do not you know you know you will answer you're accountable for every action that you ever make and you will give an account for it someday the difference between a Christian and a non-believer amen that are our sins go up to him beforeand unto judgment aren't you glad to judge amen and to get put in the sea of God's forgetfulness they drop in the blood bleach of Jesus Christ never to be remembered no more what does inumber to mean On The Backs side of the desert it means so much oh my it means that you found the pearl of P pice it means that you have come you have forsaken everything like Jesus said amen to go and follow him all right let's just start on that amen praise be to God when you meet God when God commissions you when God does something for you you'll never be the same amen and you know how many knows that there's a lot of people that try to get the Holy Ghost try to get saved try try try try there's a lot of people that try try try try and it's very hard sometimes it's very hard sometimes it's very difficult but Ephesians 1 and verse uh let me see here I think I've got it wrote down right here one and six it says to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved how many believes that God has to accept you when you come to God when you meet him on want to meet him on the back side of the desert you have to get accepted just like man if you buying a house so forth go to the bank you know the bank says you've been accepted you've been accepted how happy you are you know because you've been accepted or you've been rejected you've been denied amen when when a Christian or a sinner comes going to reject him amen didn't the prophet of God say that when a person comes to Christ and he genuinely has faith in almighty God Amen and that faith is genuine in his sacrifice is exactly the way that it's supposed to be what is a perfect sacrifice a perfect sacrifice is when you meet God's demands amen that you're willing to forsake all to follow him you don't you you love him above father mother brother sister anybody else he that that doesn't even he you got to forsake your own life to follow him and if that sacrifice is right God will accept it and he'll consume it W think about it and says you know he's obligated to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost right there and then you ain't got to ter all night when God accepts that sacrifice that repentance that's what it means on the back side of the desert it means that you've got to come by the way of Acts 238 SS don't it when he accepts it he consumes it he consumes that sacrifice he forgives you of all your past and then you can say you ask me why I'll be happy in a trillion years from now I'll say because my sins are gone there underneath the blood it happened at the cross of Calvary now there's far remov just darkness is from dawn oh aren't you glad folks I'm here to tell you we ought to be we got to be the happiest a Christian is the happiest human being at Walmart cuz there ain't very many happy there the happiest people everywhere whever you are you're the happiest person we should be the happiest people to know that you haveed from death life that's what it means my it means that you have come God's way if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me how many believe you have met those demands if you really met him the reason people don't really meet him is there're some clitch there's some cat somewhere huh not quite dead to self anymore still not quite dead because God will baptize you with the Holy Ghost if that sacrifice is Right amen take up the cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is it pro if a man shall gain the whole world Amen and lose his own soul or why would a give a man exchange under of his soul I mean every how many knows when you come to God you see God I want to give you my everything I want to give you my life doesn't matter what my brother my pastor my mom my dad doesn't matter who you disconnect like Abraham did from all friends and [Music] family how many knows our our family is the closest thing to us that's right that's what he said if you me more than you love your very best thing that you'll ever love you're not worthy of me how many believes that you got to be worthy when you come to Christ it's got to be a worthy place you got to be worthy worthy of the acceptation Paul said let us walk worthy of vocation wherewith we are called let's walk as Christians because there's certain people that are not fit not not fit to be called Christians brother man says you are not fit you have no right to call yourself a unless you have met him on the backside of the desert unless you have come to the end of yourself the death of yourself you're not fit cuz you're going to be a make believer and make Believers are the biggest stumbling back that the world has ever [Applause] [Music] known that's right three kinds of Believers that make believer that's the guy that'll do you wrong that's the guy that'll stumble you stumble you and never apologize he'll go right on in his darkness and never even know he's in darkness amen can we preach this morning my oh my I want to preach on controlling our emotions huh after a bit if we get to it if not we'll do Wednesday controlling our emotions amen like I said Wednesday when it comes to the Lord if you get a little fanatical or whatever jump over a Pew or whatever that's might be all right is that right but don't let the devil get on those feelings and those emotions that right keep them in check all right has to do with the anle part of things oh my praise be to God all right so that's right many things Jesus said is that right um I'm not sure there's another one in John in John Jesus said in five and verse 24 he says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and not come into the judgment condemnation but has passed from Death unto life that's when you really come to life we were dead before dead what did Peter say we're Lively Stones don't don't don't don't you feel like the devil just like to Swindle you down and just keep you kind of dead and just depressed and he loves to try to depress you and put fear and depression on you and everything else and but Jesus says we're Lively Stones we're alive in Christ not dead we're in heav Heavenly places not hellish places we was in hellish places before now we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's just so much that happens on that backside of the desert amen praise be to God and I love him for it don't you amen Paul said in Ephesians 2 you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins amen where in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit of them that now not now worketh in the children of of Disobedience amen so we're once dead now we're alive we were in darkness we were children of the darkness but now we're Children of the day I was telling my wife I'm on the way to on the way to church here and then I got another Revelation that whenever God accepts you whenever he accepts you he pays the price he pays your Ransom amen and I think about a week or two ago I was preaching on he is our the one that has ransomed us amen and I talked about he maybe I I kind of dramatized it as him going to the devil and breaking down his door and going in there and grabbing us out of there but that's not really the way it is that's not really the way it is because you know if he paid the ransome that means he didn't just come and rescue you he didn't just you know but he had to pay the price in other words devil had a right to hold you and the God didn't come in there and grab you the devil had a ride on you and unless he got that slip unless he paid the price you would go nowhere but when he paid the price on Calvary he paid my Ransom and he sent me free he is mind that that's what Calvary did how many that that's what happens on the back side of the desert when God takes you out of the devil's pawn shop he oh my amen my God is good isn't he God is good amen now back to Genesis for a minute let's look at verse one again in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth didn't he he created the heavens and the Earth praise the Lord and now in Ephesians 2 and verse 10 it says that we are his workmanship created [Music] cre I'm saved you he was doing the work he was when he paid that price amen when he be took the burden of paying for you and and accepting you he was creating you we are created by Jesus Christ unto good work which God ha for ordained that we should walk you know what he's building out of us he's building a temple for him to dwell in creating it according to verse 22 he says he says now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets how many knows another place he says we've come to the New Jerusalem the Heavenly Jerusalem Jem amen that's right Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into a holy Temple in the Lord hallelujah in whom ye also are built together for an habitation of God through the spirit amen so God Corinthians 5:7 2 Corinthians 5:1 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature hallelujah oh things are passed away hallel he made a brand new man a new creation somewhere in that muck somewhere down in that myy clay oh if he ever receives you remember he tried he he Shone his light on the Pharisees and the scribes but it just didn't Quicken nothing but the woman at the well steep in sin a't that right when he told her what you done and on all of that he says it quick she come to life she was a new creature so to speak hello she come to life is she because she had representation if you're truly born again let me just say this calmly if you're truly born again it means that you have had representation in heaven representation in other words You' got another body over there and he's got to bring this by what that should do to us to think that if you're truly Born Again you've got representation there is nothing that you have to be afraid of Hallelujah if you are a new creature in Christ old things have passed away behold new amen away what did Brother Bram say that the process of the earth go through the process of the earth future home of the Heavenly bridegroom the bride Amen brother B goes talking about he says whenever Noah under Noah there was the water baptism she got baptized with water got her water blood isn't that right she got s she's ready justification sanctification amen W man it's going to be so hot in the heavens and all over the Earth everything's going to be so hot the elements shall melt with fervent heat and if you look for such things be diligent that they be proud of him without spot and blameless amen so we see the process the Earth go through on the backside of the desert every believer goes through that amen God picks you up he justifies you he sanctifies you and he baptizes you with Holy Ghost Fire anden and it consumes everything that you have ever done it consumes every germ it account was settled long ago and the record's cleared today for heed my away AR you glad the record was set straight your history was erased if you really met him on the back side of the doer it me he just ified you Justified is as though you have never done it in the first place 20 years I was a sinner but those 20 years are all erased all erased all gone how many's glad to have an eraser in your life what does it say if we do sin what if you sin now if you sin now about that I wonder many how many sitting there last week amen you need somebody Racing for last week how many believes you can have it this morning just raise your hand and say Lord I need some forgiveness right here I'm not perfect yet that no I won't but God forgive me am me I got some sins that need to be put under the blood of Jesus Christ huh that's right aren't you glad for that eraser means you have come the same process the Earth is going to go through amen and we know the fire is coming is that right train of people that was going west they got out middle of the Prairie and the prie fire and that big old fire was coming to him everybody from here set it on fire and burn it don't let it and so so far everybody stomped it around this way and it perhaps they went with the wind no doubt that wind just burned it all that way and as soon as it was all burnt everywhere the ashes little girl says oh she was all scared and the little brother said don't worry sis we're standing where the fire has already been I mean you ain't got to worry about the Judgment you ain't got to worry about hell you ain't got to worry why are you so what are you so loud about brother B why what I'm burning Hallelujah the fire is up on here burning all the sins of the world and S of the world out how many believe that that's where you are that's what it means to be on the back side of the desert means or standing where the fire has already been thank you Lord and you can take it a little easy now you can rest you can rest amen mat the ghost of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist and some Elias and others jeremias and one of the prophets he sayth unto them but whom do you say that I am Simon for Flesh and Blood had not revealed said I it on battling with things because it's just not enough to have it in your brain wouldn't it be something if all you you had to do is have knowledge of it well there would be no need for sacrifice there would be no need of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we need more than just an understanding of it in a mind and you've got to have it down in that every individual you can't you have got to have your own personal experience with almighty God oh you'll never stand in this hour you'll never overcome nobody can give to you you got to have your own backside of the desert Hallelujah now notice I'll build my church in the gates of shall not Prevail against it you know Jesus really threw them a curve ball whenever he said go into all the world baptizing them in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost he threw him a curveball huh but here he threw him a curve ball because it looks so much like Thou Art Peter and upon this I'll build my church didn't the Catholics take that and say hey church is built upon Peter no a comes along huh it says no no no no it wasn't upon Peter that the church was built Jesus went from saying y'all are Peter but I'm talking about the revelation of who I am that's Pro God knows just how to write it and now look at all the people that are baptizing in father son the Holy Ghost aren't you glad that there's a prophet that come along and told us what the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost was it's folks probably a first understand if you explained the water baptism to him I mean you know you say ask a little girl you know is your father name father you call him father but that's not his name and he's a son and he's got the Holy Ghost but son's not his name but they still don't get it do they they won't they they they stuck to their tradition we need the revelation of almighty God to strike us and say God whatever your word says is what I want amen I like this oh my listen he says I will de Upon This Rock I'll build my church and and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it it means that when you get saved folks I'm here to tell you all that the father given me he will come and no man can pluck him out of my hand aren't you glad that God that fills the universe holds the world in the palm of his hand anden he holds you in his hand and nobody can ever pluck them out of his hand if that don't make us want to run the balconies I know will Glory I surren myself completely to God his responsibility that makes your foot feel good think that God is got you in his hand that's what it means what else does it mean it means that you are now bought with a price you are not your own I'm not my own I'm his you want to do something to me come on come on get up brother John get up brother John stand right there will you face that way all right right there all right brother Russell come on get me when you try to get me if you can huh you got go through this guy right all right that's good thank you brothers that's the way it is with Christ the devil can't get to you unless he gets to go through a bigger man that bigger man is Jesus Christ Glory the devil can't even do anything he can't bring anything upon you without personal permission why that's why we ought to be the happiest people in the world that's why a Christian is the happiest person in the world a Christian that's what it is that's what it means be a Christian hey right I want to try to relive a little bit more that right I know that is but still God is good isn't he now oh my bought with a price and we get what a rock Upon This Rock I'll build my church we had sing the song be sure be [Applause] sure your Anchor Holds and grips the solid rock on Christ I don't care what religion there is it's all s sing the god of the pillar of fire that's the only real God all other gods or false gods well that wouldn't be too popular in a big old mega church somewhere would it h no they wouldn't they would try to not say that all those who have embraced Allah and Muhammad and huh I think Muhammad Ali didn't he uh Embrace Muhammad and stuff for his religion yeah you go ahead you'll answer and you'll bow to Jesus one of these days every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord amen foolish Amen to turn from Christianity to some other religion there is only one Rock Amen before folks we were out there in darkness most Darkness was upon the face of the deep upon the Earth that's what you in the rights to and fro nothing real solid on us I was watching y'all on my iPad back there coming in taking your places being tossed here and tired there get Anchored In Christ amen is that all right an anchor how many's glad for that anchor all right listen brother B this he says a Christian is not about and fum and worry about things amen a Christ rest it'ss all praise the Lord then he tells the story I love to tell that is by coming that him coming by Harbor one time and he was in the plane he looked down there amen and the sails had been let down on this on this boat and so forth and what a storm was on that sea she was tossing and so forth that ship was rocking back and forth she had some waves that would go in some W would go under and everything else and he said oh I wonder what it is and the fellow next to me said he says he's got a Seeker see a sea anchor on it therefore the ship cannot sink y'all sit tight now think about it you're in Christ you can't sink you won't sink oh why I'll tell you why because I don't know I don't care what kind of a boat it is amen but I'll tell about out there in the ocean amen if there's a storm coming am me they let down their anchor amen they might get mud it just it might get a hold of a tree branch and it'll just tear that loose you know but it don't need a round rock and all jump over Round Rock but it needs to rock with a little Cliff amen so that anchor can grip and I'm going to tell you right now that anchor Amen in that rock that we have Amen in the Cliff of the Rock Amen we had a we had a slit right in there amen and when you go in there and you're part of that when he grips that what he did amen it'll never let go that's what you and I are we are anchored in the C Jesus Christ in the Clift of The [Music] Rock in my way of thinking we probably have't the nicest of any Christians of any age even Luther had to run for his life and watch because they was trying to kill him is that right Bloody Mary come up and killed all those all 300 was it ministers and things trying to get rid of Christianity and reinstate Catholicism or and killed they knew what it was like to have it rough to have it hard because this world is not my home and you're not welcome here how many knows we're not welcome here and they're going to let that us know that after a while shut places like this down oh look at what they're doing already if they can shut the police force down they can shut churches down amen my praise the Lord all right let's talk about this before we go a little further on the anchor let's talk about not being tossed how many believe that we don't we don't want to be tossed about in Ephesians 4 he says you know he gave the five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the Saints and so forth till we all come to the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man andto the statue of the perfect the the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro brother Bram says listen a Christian does isn't is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things amen here even Paul was talking to Ephesians he says you know a real Christian man that Is Anchored In Christ I mean you're not tossed to and fro and carried about out with every wind of Doctrine by the sight of men anden you're not easily moved woo you don't get shook up too quick I manyan those make Believers get shook up right I'm GNA read this and then we'll talk about being dismayed all right Jude 1 and verse five it says and I will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew it how that the Lord having saved the people of the out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believ not now how many know they were make Believers sure they were all part of Israel they were all they all took part of the Red Sea amen they all loved dancing and going out of Egypt praising God but what happened God begin to work on their emotions I mean because your emotions need to stay in check your feelings have to stay in check we need to be there's one thing about it and I want to I want to take probably a sermon on and talking about the character L Le the one thing a Christian has his character what he do bring him right down to where they would be scared a trap called the Red Sea so to how they would do emotionally God wants to know how you do emotionally amen how well you control your emotion but they didn't believe let me tell you something if you aren't a Believer you're not going to do so well cuz this world lives by their emotions by their feelings why do you think road range is so crazy out there because they ain't got control enough to control themselves one thing the Christian does is have some self-control praise be to God oh my I thought about that not just on I don't know how much of the other we'll get but we'll just go as far as we can praise the Lord now notice believe not even the angels which kept not their first estatement left a habitation has reserved an everlasting chains under darkness of Judgment of the great day Sodom and Gomorrah how many knows that's exactly what you and I are seeing in our world today the winds is tossing the they're being tossed with the winds that come through the first wind that came through politically was taking prayer out of schools how many know they should have never allowed it they should have tell them to take a hike that judge should have said no way in the world devil get out of my courtroom that's what he should have said hello cuz now look at where it's gone now not they all they're trying to transgender the kids in school bunch of perverts that's right you're a bunch of perverts insane lost your mind what the world has why because they're tossed I mean believe even the Bible says that people would not endure sound Doctrine got to be careful around the message hello heard a preacher just a famous preacher said that last week he said conduct order and Doctrine I don't have nothing to do with it ain't nothing but binding people and stuff putting them in the box very popular very messy Prater I was like oooooo I'd be careful so you know more about it than brother bam did that's exactly what you're saying brother Bram would never done it if it didn't need to be done then I read over here what Paul said that you need not know how to behave yourself in the house of God God told everybody how to behave in the house of God having deacons in the house of God this that or the other all to keep hon you see folks when Revelation don't line up with all the word and I begin to question you toss I wonder i' like listen to him I want to hear what else he's got to say huh especially when my family's involved hello better watch it why soon you'll be way out there how many believe say what's on them tapes we can have dancing I guess if you afraid they can't do this that or the other you can have dancing you can have screaming you can have a you can have shout all in order speaking Tong all in order I CU they G and get on somebody and cause A disruption in the surface and all of a sudden begin to speak in in tongues so you tell me all all those times that that happened in brother Ram's meetings huh how many knows that one place he got so bad that brother bam said shut down he was very lenient was very given on Spirit of dis prophets is subject to prophets Holy Spirit won't go out there and disrupt in the middle of an altar call or this that or the other that's Soul's a whole lot more worth than worth more you disrupting service anyway tossed I mean believe we don't want to be tossed don't be tossed know where you stand and stand there oh my people will put things on there that gender St Strife put questions on there that all they do is gender Strife according to what Paul said a't that right amen all right I like that praise the Lord these are spots make Believers are spots in your feasts of Charity when when they Feast with you feeding themselves with fear they are clouds without water amen clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withered without fruit what did Jesus do to that tree that didn't bear fruit what kind of tree was it fig tree yeah fig tree thank you helping me preach this morning a fig tree no fruit Jesus curs it didn't he now what you do cut it off and then what Israel happened that's what happened to Israel none of them made it into the promised land Bible says you're every one dead oh my why make Believers Lord Jesus help us not to be that I don't want to be a make believer a genuine believer not tossed like the Angels were not tossed like Egypt was is that right not Egypt but even Israel how they were tossed with their emotions every time something come along they'd open their mouth run their mouth I think as James said he that controls his tongue is a perfect man if you can control this you've got to have something down here you g to have to be anchored how many believe that amen uh carried about of winds trees whose fruit withered without fruit twice the plucked up by their root their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness forever help us Lord Jesus amen but preach a m called is your life worthy of the Gospel how many wants a worthy life amen did you know that certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around you don't know why that loving type of person my next thought is that a real genuine Christ has the atmosphere around them just as a church has an atmosphere about them a Christian has an atmosphere about them amen oh my a loving type of person have you seen that that's right you like to be around them they create that Atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation then you've seen those who every time you just shun them he says all the time they want to talk about something evil or talk about somebody that's right I think every one of us is older now we know that when you go to talking about now you know brother Wallace you know brother John you know brother Joshua as soon as somebody says somebody's name red flag soon as somebody talks to says something about somebody ears are up is it good or is it bad amen that's right because cuz the devil lives there he'll tear families apart he'll tear friendships apart Bible even talks about a Whisperer and somebody that tells tales and somebody else separates Chief friends did you know what they said about you you devil huh you was a saint you wouldn't tell him if you didn't know you'd be listening to anything good they had to say about you and say he said this about you that was good that's
