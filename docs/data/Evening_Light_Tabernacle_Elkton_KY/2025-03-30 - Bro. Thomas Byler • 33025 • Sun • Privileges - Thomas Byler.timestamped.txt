[13:11] Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[13:13] If we'll just uh stand this morning.
[13:20] Maybe uh Tommy will open us in prayer
[13:23] this
[13:38] morning.
[13:52] Jesus worship service
[14:06] resurrection.
[14:25] Amen. The children can be dismissed for
[14:26] Sunday school. And if you'll go with me
[14:28] in the Psalms, we're going to be in
[14:30] Psalms 35 this morning.
[14:37] Psalms 35. We're not going to read the
[14:39] whole Psalm. We'll read up to uh verse
[14:48] 10.
[14:49] Please, sorry. Here we go. Plead my
[14:52] cause, O Lord, with them that strive
[14:54] with me. Fight against them that fight
[14:56] against me.
[15:02] Draw out also the spear and stop the way
[15:05] against them that persecute me. Say unto
[15:08] my soul, I am thy salvation.
[15:21] Let them be as a shaft before the wind,
[15:24] and let the angel of the Lord chase
[15:26] them.
[15:33] For without cause have they hid for me
[15:36] their net in a pit, which without cause
[15:39] they have digged for my soul.
[15:52] And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord.
[15:54] It shall rejoice in his
[15:56] salvation. All my bones shall say, Lord,
[15:59] who is like unto thee which deliverest
[16:02] the poor from him that is too strong for
[16:05] him? Yay, the poor and the needy from
[16:07] him that spoilth him. God bless you. May
[16:10] be seated, Brother
[16:22] Brian.
[16:23] Morning brothers and
[16:27] sisters. If would you would uh turn with
[16:30] me to the uh excuse me
[16:35] uh the 12th chapter of
[16:37] u the gospel of
[16:41] John.
[16:44] But you know the world is a really dark
[16:47] place that we live in this morning.
[16:49] Before I get started in this Gospel of
[16:51] John, if you look, everyone knows this
[16:54] picture over here, this last age that we
[16:57] live
[16:58] in, it's just total darkness. And like
[17:03] brother Brown said, you're the only
[17:04] light in this age that we live in.
[17:06] You're the light that people see the
[17:08] through the darkness that we have this
[17:10] morning. And I was thinking, the world
[17:13] is a pretty dark place, but we have hope
[17:15] as Christians this morning. If the
[17:18] spirit of God abides in you and the seed
[17:20] of life is in you, then you have no
[17:22] problems. And not being funny this
[17:25] morning, but I was thinking of brother
[17:27] John Wade. Just imagine if Brother John
[17:29] was still living in England this morning
[17:31] or anyone that was from a European
[17:34] country that has citizenship. Just think
[17:36] if they were still living in those
[17:38] countries this morning and you believe
[17:40] like we believe, you could find yourself
[17:42] in prison this morning. You know,
[17:44] they're arresting people in England this
[17:47] morning through the just because they
[17:50] don't agree with the way the school
[17:51] teaches their children or they disagree
[17:54] with what the government is doing.
[17:56] They're putting people in prison this
[17:57] morning because of their beliefs. And
[18:00] it's not too far away from our own
[18:02] country. If you live out on the West
[18:03] Coast, that's how dark of an age. It's a
[18:07] glorious age, but it's also a dark age.
[18:09] If you live out on the West Coast from
[18:12] California up to ever Everton in in
[18:17] Washington, you don't have any control
[18:19] of what they teach your kids if they're
[18:21] in public school. They want to identify
[18:23] it. Whatever they want to identify,
[18:25] they're going to hide it from you.
[18:27] You're going to let your kids be what
[18:28] they want to be. So, it's a real dark
[18:30] age that we live in this morning. And
[18:32] the only hope is if you have that seed
[18:34] of life in you this morning and you're
[18:36] the light people when they see you, they
[18:38] should see Jesus Christ this morning.
[18:41] And let me go to this
[18:44] uh about the 22nd
[18:47] verse
[18:49] here. I think I'm in the right
[18:52] chapter starting at the 22nd. Philip
[18:54] cometh and tellth Andrew and again
[18:56] Andrew. Philip tell this is when the
[18:58] Greeks came came to see Jesus and Jesus
[19:01] answered you have to forgive me I've had
[19:04] this Bible so long it's falling
[19:06] apart and the hour has come that the son
[19:09] of man should be glorified that's the
[19:11] hour we live in this morning too verily
[19:14] verily I say unto you except the corn of
[19:17] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[19:19] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[19:22] forth much fruit and uh he loveth his
[19:25] life shall lose it. And he that hated
[19:27] his life in this world shall keep it
[19:30] unto life eternal. So that's where we're
[19:32] at this morning. And if any man serve
[19:35] me, let him follow me. Where I am, they
[19:38] there shall also my servant be. If any
[19:41] man serve him, him will my father honor.
[19:45] And then he goes on to say, now my soul
[19:47] is
[19:48] troubled. And what shall I say? Father,
[19:50] save me from this hour. for the the for
[19:53] this cause have I come in unto this
[19:56] hour. Father, glorify thy name. And we
[19:58] know what happened after that. And I was
[20:01] listening to that message this morning.
[20:03] It was in the the devotional from from
[20:06] yesterday, convinced and concerned. And
[20:09] what made me think of these few verses
[20:12] in the Gospel of John? Um, Brother
[20:15] Brandham was starting that message like
[20:17] he normally he's inducing himself. you
[20:20] know, he's talking about different
[20:22] things and then he and then he mentions
[20:25] uh brother Neville and and he talks
[20:28] about brother Neville, his pastor. What
[20:30] really struck me and he goes back to
[20:32] being the seed of life and he talks
[20:35] about how brother Neville is that oak
[20:38] tree, that big oak tree that you can
[20:40] rest under in the woods. Um, all you
[20:43] woodsmen know exactly what brother
[20:44] Brown's talking about. anyone that spent
[20:47] a life in the woods, you always got that
[20:49] big white oak or red oak that it's just
[20:51] the base is so large that you can rest
[20:54] on and you have shade under. And and he
[20:57] was talking about brother Neville's life
[20:59] that he was a he was instant in season
[21:03] and out of season. He was consistent. He
[21:06] never changed. He was the Christian that
[21:08] you could depend on that was stable with
[21:11] when no matter what the world is. And I
[21:13] was thinking this morning, that's where
[21:16] we want to be this morning. You want to
[21:18] be that oak tree. You want whether it's
[21:20] an oak or whether it's a sugar maple,
[21:22] whatever that big, tall, strong tree is,
[21:25] you want to be that tree this morning.
[21:27] You want to be that tree that's not
[21:29] moved by what's going on in the world.
[21:32] You know, you have to have, you know,
[21:33] any tree has to have the wind or
[21:36] struggles for it to grow larger and to
[21:38] become stronger. And no different in our
[21:40] lives this morning. We have to have
[21:42] tribulations, good times, bad times.
[21:45] They all will make you a better
[21:46] Christian this morning. And you
[21:48] shouldn't you shouldn't be afraid of
[21:50] what's going I was just thinking in the
[21:52] age that we're in this morning. What he
[21:54] was talking about, Brother Neville, I I
[21:56] would want in my own
[21:58] life if the world was just totally dark
[22:01] and I couldn't see in front of my hand
[22:03] out there, I would still trust him.
[22:05] Whatever whether the world was on fire,
[22:08] I would still trust him. no matter what
[22:10] the circumstances were, I would still
[22:13] trust him and everything that I believed
[22:15] this morning. And that's we're coming to
[22:17] the point where you there's they say
[22:20] that a lot where people are playing
[22:22] church. I I know you ministers talk
[22:25] about it. People come across well well
[22:28] past playing church. I know that. Well,
[22:31] you you can't play with God in your
[22:33] lives and you have to be rooted in the
[22:35] word of God this morning or you could be
[22:38] easily and I was just thinking of the
[22:39] Europeans and in England, you know, you
[22:42] think a country like Germany that had
[22:45] Luther for a messenger and a country
[22:47] like England that had John Wesley and
[22:50] you see where they're at this morning.
[22:52] You know, they just have a government
[22:53] church. That's all they have. They have
[22:55] government churches. The way they get
[22:57] like they are is there no life in their
[23:00] heart. There's no seed of life. So they
[23:02] they just keep going further and further
[23:05] out. And I was thinking this morning,
[23:07] you could be in the message this morning
[23:10] and the same thing could happen to you.
[23:12] But let me
[23:13] read I hope I don't mess up here this
[23:17] morning with these uh thing. I was if
[23:20] you turn with me to Galatians the 2
[23:22] chapter this morning.
[23:25] We'll start at
[23:28] about about the 16th verse. I actually
[23:32] made it bigger because I'm having a hard
[23:34] time with this light reading my Bible,
[23:36] but I made the words bigger. And I was
[23:38] thinking this is where we're at this
[23:40] morning. I'll start at about the 16th
[23:42] verse. I'll give I know I get in a hurry
[23:44] and I don't ever give you a time to
[23:46] catch up, but the second chapter of
[23:48] Galatians, the 16th verse. knowing that
[23:51] a man is not justified by works of the
[23:54] law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ.
[23:57] And we all stand that way this morning.
[23:59] We're only justified by faith in Jesus
[24:02] Christ. This morning, even we have
[24:04] believed in Jesus Christ that we might
[24:06] be justified by the faith of Christ and
[24:10] not by works of the law. For by works of
[24:12] the law shall no just flesh be
[24:15] justified. But then you can go back to
[24:17] James the 2 chapter and James said, you
[24:20] know, you got to have both. You it has
[24:22] to be a balanced Christian life this
[24:25] morning. And he goes on to say in the
[24:27] 17th verse, but if while we seek to be
[24:30] justified by Christ, we ourselves are
[24:32] found sinners, it is therefore Christ
[24:34] the mentor of sin, God forbid. And he
[24:37] goes on to say, for I build again the
[24:40] things which I destroy. I make myself a
[24:42] transgressor.
[24:43] For through the law I am dead to the law
[24:46] that I might live onto God. So I
[24:48] surrender everything about me.
[24:50] Everything that's in my heart or life, I
[24:52] surrender it to Christ so that I can
[24:54] die. And then he goes on to say here in
[24:58] the 20th verse, I'm sure some of you
[25:00] might have plaques that have this verse
[25:02] in your house or in your office or
[25:04] wherever you're at. And it says in this
[25:06] 20th verse, it's a verse to remember
[25:10] anytime you come into a situation where
[25:12] you find it hard to believe. It says
[25:14] here, I am crucified with Christ. So
[25:17] I've allowed Christ to totally take
[25:19] control of my life. I I'm dead to
[25:21] myself. It's Christ that lives in me.
[25:24] Nevertheless, I live, not yet I. By
[25:26] Christ liveth in me, and the life which
[25:28] I now live in the flesh, I live by the
[25:31] faith of the Son of God, who loved me
[25:33] and gave himself for me.
[25:35] And he goes on to say here, I do not
[25:38] frustrate the grace of God. For if
[25:40] righteousness come by the law, then
[25:42] Christ is dead in vain. So not to say
[25:45] that you can't that you want to strive
[25:47] to do the right thing every day. But
[25:49] that won't save you. It's Christ alone
[25:52] that saves you and the gift of God that
[25:54] he gives to you. And uh I just wrote
[25:57] some
[26:01] notes and I was thinking this morning
[26:04] that I was listening I was reading some
[26:09] devotionals and I it really struck me
[26:11] there's three types of people in the
[26:14] world and there's three types of
[26:16] believers. You know you all come across
[26:19] believers that are very pessimistic
[26:21] about how they look at life. But you
[26:24] know, a pessimism, a Christian shouldn't
[26:26] be a have a pessimistic type of view.
[26:29] That's a big word. Basically, a
[26:31] pessimist is someone that doesn't think
[26:34] he's good enough or struggles every day
[26:36] of his life. He just can't accept God
[26:38] for who God is. He's always struggling.
[26:41] He's always seeing clouds of darkness in
[26:43] everything he does in life. That's not
[26:45] how a Christian should live their life
[26:47] this morning. And he I wrote that in
[26:50] this time is bad in people they should
[26:53] it keeps people from being a believer
[26:56] and people that have pessimism in their
[26:59] life you know them you see them every
[27:01] day they wind up to be drug abusers
[27:04] alcoholics all the things they just
[27:06] don't believe enough to let those things
[27:08] fall from them and then they he was
[27:11] talking about another type of person in
[27:13] the world and it's really you have those
[27:15] two types you have people that are
[27:17] either pessimistic ic or egotistical.
[27:20] It's just one or the other. And that's
[27:22] narcissism also. And I was just
[27:25] thinking, it's easy in this age to be
[27:27] one or the other. But a true believer
[27:29] pushes all that darkness away from him
[27:32] and then just embraces the cross. But I
[27:35] was just thinking what God is looking
[27:36] for Christians this morning, not taking
[27:38] a lot of time, is he Christians are
[27:41] responsible. They take responsibility
[27:43] for their actions both in the spiritual
[27:46] and the natural sense. The word of God
[27:48] brings them into a place where you can
[27:51] count on them to do the right thing in
[27:53] their lives. And I'll just read this and
[27:56] I'll sit down. I'm getting off my point
[27:58] this
[27:59] morning. If I
[28:01] read in um I believe Yeah.
[28:07] Philippians the
[28:09] uh may
[28:13] sure Philippians the uh first
[28:19] chapter about the 14th verse I'll just
[28:22] sit down after reading a few of these
[28:24] voices but I was just thinking you know
[28:26] before I read
[28:28] this everything all the word of God lays
[28:32] before us whatever
[28:35] We just simply need to believe it. Have
[28:37] faith in it. God will bring it about.
[28:39] Whatever wherever you're at in your
[28:41] life. If the seed of life is in you and
[28:44] it's God's seed of life, it's going to
[28:46] come to life. You can't make it come to
[28:49] life. You know, the word of God will
[28:51] water it. You can't make it grow. You
[28:53] just got to let it grow this morning.
[28:56] You can you can't struggle. You just got
[28:58] to let it go. And I'll just read this
[29:00] here.
[29:01] Many of the brethren in the Lord waxing
[29:03] confident by my bonds are much more bold
[29:06] to speak the word without fear. So by
[29:08] Paul's example, everyone was willing to
[29:11] to go out on the limb and preach Christ.
[29:15] Some indeed Christ preached Christ even
[29:18] on envy and stripes. Some also to good
[29:20] will. One priest Christ of contention,
[29:23] not sincerely supposing to add
[29:25] affliction to my bonds, but other of
[29:28] love, knowing that I am set for the
[29:29] defense of the gospel. What then?
[29:32] Notwithstanding every way, whether in
[29:34] pretense or in truth, Christ is
[29:36] preached, therein do I rejoice. Yay, I
[29:39] will rejoice. And Paul is saying, when
[29:41] the word of God goes out, however it
[29:44] goes out, if there's a seed out there,
[29:46] it'll bring forth life. And he goes on
[29:48] to say in the 20th verse, "According to
[29:51] my earnest expectation of my hope, that
[29:54] in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in
[29:56] with all boldness and always, so now
[29:59] also Christ shall be magnified in my
[30:01] body, whether it be by life or by death.
[30:05] For in me to live is Christ, and to die
[30:07] is gain." I'm sure some people have that
[30:10] scripture on the wall, too, but it's
[30:12] really true. But if I live in the flesh,
[30:15] that is the fruit of my labor. What
[30:17] shall I choose? I want not for I am
[30:20] straight bets having a desire to part
[30:23] and to be with Christ which is far
[30:25] better. And then he goes but he said
[30:27] this to his people here. Nevertheless
[30:30] abide in the flesh is more needful for
[30:33] you. And having this confidence I know
[30:35] that I shall abide and continue with you
[30:38] in all furness of joy and faith. As I I
[30:41] finished this morning, I was just
[30:46] thinking, at the age we live where we're
[30:49] at this
[30:50] morning, the only hope you have, I I
[30:53] know I say this a lot, but I, you know,
[30:55] as a
[30:56] Christian, you can't say it enough.
[30:58] Everything that we are this morning is
[31:01] dependent on Christ abiding in our
[31:03] hearts and life. Whatever your struggle
[31:05] is this morning, whatever that whatever
[31:08] is taking control of your mind,
[31:11] you God is more than able whatever that
[31:14] cloud of darkness is or whatever that
[31:16] situ I know for a fact God is more than
[31:19] able to bring about the light of his
[31:21] gospel in people's heart about to to
[31:24] change situations. I have no doubt in my
[31:26] mind. The one thing I've learned is you
[31:29] can never sell God short, brothers and
[31:31] sisters. He is going to make a way for
[31:33] you or for me to be successful and be
[31:36] there on that day. Brother Josh or
[31:39] Brother
[31:53] David. Man, it's good to be in the house
[31:55] of the Lord this morning. Amen. Sister
[31:57] Becky, I wonder if we could just start
[31:58] with Way Maker this morning.

[1:03:07] your seed fall on good ground this
[1:03:10] morning, Lord. And we just commit
[1:03:12] ourselves to you. And we want to thank
[1:03:13] you, Lord Jesus, for the opportunity,
[1:03:15] Lord, to be assembled again together in
[1:03:18] your name, Lord. For we know that when
[1:03:20] we were gathered like this in your name,
[1:03:22] you said that you would be there in our
[1:03:24] midst. And we thank you so much for it
[1:03:27] that you are here with us, Lord Jesus.
[1:03:29] We ask God that you'll just bless the

[1:03:41] amen. Kind of a different title this
[1:03:44] morning, but Amen. something we've
[1:03:46] perhaps not not titled it this way
[1:03:49] before, but it's going to be on the line
[1:03:51] of of
[1:03:53] uh things like um perseverance or thirst
[1:03:58] or or some of some of those titles that
[1:04:00] brother Brandham had. But this one here,
[1:04:02] amen, is just going to be we're going to
[1:04:04] speak on privileges. Amen.
[1:04:07] Privileges. Amen. Our privileges. So, if
[1:04:11] you will turn your Bibles to
[1:04:15] Matthew 11. Matthew
[1:04:23] 11. How many is enjoying the nice spring
[1:04:25] weather? Amen. It has arrived again.
[1:04:29] Amen. And it certainly is welcome.
[1:04:31] Praise the Lord. Good to see the grass
[1:04:33] grow. See, good to see the leaves come
[1:04:34] out. Amen. It's hard to believe that it
[1:04:37] goes by that fast, don't it? Winter
[1:04:39] winter just don't last long anymore.
[1:04:41] Amen. Time don't last long. A day
[1:04:43] doesn't last long. At least not for me.
[1:04:46] Amen. Goes very fast. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:49] All right. Matthew 11 and uh we'll begin
[1:04:52] with verse
[1:04:54] 28. Come unto me all ye that labor and
[1:04:57] are heavy laden, and I will give you
[1:05:00] rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:05:02] me for I am meek and lowly of heart and
[1:05:05] ye shall find rest unto your souls. For
[1:05:08] my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[1:05:11] May God add his blessings to the reading
[1:05:12] word. You can be seated. Amen. We want
[1:05:16] to kind of uh speak along the lines.
[1:05:20] Amen. Of I know we have spoken on Amen.
[1:05:23] an open door. God's open door. Amen. And
[1:05:26] I would might have called this the door
[1:05:28] of privilege. The door of privilege.
[1:05:32] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:35] And of course, we know that Jesus
[1:05:37] Christ, Amen, and what he has done for
[1:05:39] us, he's opened up so much for us. Amen.
[1:05:43] Um, I'm going to read another scripture,
[1:05:46] I think, over in the book of Hebrews.
[1:05:49] Hebrews
[1:05:55] 2. Hebrews
[1:05:57] 2 and verse 1 and 1-3. Therefore, we
[1:06:02] ought to give the more earnest heed to
[1:06:05] the things which we have heard. Amen.
[1:06:08] Ain't that a good statement? How many
[1:06:10] believes we ought to do that? We need to
[1:06:13] give the more earnest heed. And that's
[1:06:15] what we're going to do this morning is
[1:06:16] give more earnest heed to things that we
[1:06:18] have already
[1:06:20] heard.
[1:06:22] Amen. That's right.
[1:06:25] At least at any time we should let them
[1:06:28] slip because we as human beings are very
[1:06:30] good at
[1:06:31] forgetting. We're very good at letting
[1:06:34] them slip out of our mind and so forth.
[1:06:37] For if the word spoken by angels was
[1:06:39] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:06:41] disobedience received a just and
[1:06:43] recompense of reward, how shall we
[1:06:46] escape if we neglect so great a
[1:06:49] salvation? Amen. Now, how many knows
[1:06:51] salvation is something that means that
[1:06:53] you have been saved from something?
[1:06:56] Amen. You've been saved from something.
[1:06:58] You've been rescued from something.
[1:07:00] Amen. And if you neglect that salvation,
[1:07:03] Amen. Of course, we realize that's what
[1:07:05] came the Lord came to do is to give us
[1:07:08] Amen. that salvation. But if you neglect
[1:07:10] that salvation, Amen. There's going to
[1:07:13] be a penalty that comes with it, isn't
[1:07:15] it? Major big penalty that comes along
[1:07:18] with neglecting. Amen. The salvation
[1:07:21] that God has brought to this world.
[1:07:25] Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Benam, he
[1:07:28] makes a statement. I think that's just
[1:07:29] about where our churches are getting. He
[1:07:31] says we're children of God. He says,
[1:07:33] "But we're losing our inheritance by our
[1:07:35] conduct and things that we do." He says,
[1:07:38] "Things that we permit to be done and so
[1:07:40] forth." The way we act and live. He
[1:07:41] says, Brother B makes a statement. He
[1:07:43] says, "We're living millions of miles
[1:07:46] below our privileges."
[1:07:50] privileges. Amen.
[1:07:53] Privileges.
[1:07:55] My And he says, "Mostly because God will
[1:07:58] do something and we'll say, well, Dr. So
[1:08:00] and so said so and so." He's like, "What
[1:08:03] does it matter what doctor so and so
[1:08:05] says? If God comes and vindicates
[1:08:07] something, they ought to do something
[1:08:08] for you."
[1:08:10] Amen.
[1:08:13] And I was thinking back there, what is
[1:08:15] our privileges? What What is our
[1:08:18] privilege? What is
[1:08:19] our god-given privilege?
[1:08:23] Well, we know that uh privileges is
[1:08:26] something uh a lot of times it's just
[1:08:28] your you might you might say, "Well, you
[1:08:30] were born privileged. Your mom and daddy
[1:08:33] are rich, you know, and so you were born
[1:08:35] a privileged
[1:08:37] person." Maybe something you didn't have
[1:08:39] to earn, something you didn't have to
[1:08:41] buy.
[1:08:43] You're just It's a privilege. Something
[1:08:45] that's given to you for free. Amen.
[1:08:53] Amen. Let me just start
[1:08:58] uh start with the simple
[1:09:01] things again. He
[1:09:04] says he says uh well I'm I'm going to
[1:09:07] read this
[1:09:09] next. He says we should never live under
[1:09:12] our privileges as we are today. The
[1:09:14] great powers of God lays within the
[1:09:16] reach of every member of the body. What
[1:09:18] things soever you desire when you pray,
[1:09:20] when you you if you believe it, you
[1:09:22] shall receive it. Now, let me go back to
[1:09:25] thought for just a minute. I never
[1:09:26] finished my thought. What is our
[1:09:28] privileges? Well, I'll tell you what our
[1:09:30] God-given privileges are. What our
[1:09:32] God-given privileges are is what they
[1:09:34] had at Pentecost.
[1:09:36] I mean, the book of Acts is our
[1:09:38] inaliable right. We can have what they
[1:09:42] had in the book of Acts. And if we don't
[1:09:45] have that, then you're living below your
[1:09:47] privileges. If we don't have what Peter
[1:09:50] had when he walked up to that impotent
[1:09:52] man, Amen. And said, "Silver and gold
[1:09:54] have none, but such as I have, I give
[1:09:56] unto thee." Amen. Amen. The full power
[1:10:00] of God upon the people.
[1:10:03] You know that Jesus when he went to
[1:10:05] Calvary now I just want to say this that
[1:10:08] privileges don't come free
[1:10:12] like freedom isn't free right
[1:10:15] privileges aren't free
[1:10:19] and you my we could sit here till this
[1:10:23] evening just talking about our
[1:10:25] privileges
[1:10:28] and sometimes I think well brother you
[1:10:30] you're just going a little bit funny
[1:10:31] here or whatever But you know when I
[1:10:33] when I talk about simple little things
[1:10:35] about our privileges about as simple
[1:10:37] thing as as you had the God gave you the
[1:10:40] privilege of waking up this morning.
[1:10:44] Yeah. That was a privilege. Why? Because
[1:10:47] brother Bam says, "How do you know that
[1:10:49] you're going to ever make it out of
[1:10:50] here? How do you know that you know
[1:10:52] what's going to happen next? We don't
[1:10:53] you don't know. You have no promise.
[1:10:56] I have no promise of finishing this
[1:10:58] message."
[1:11:00] Hello. So, it's all a privilege. The
[1:11:02] breath that you draw, the fact that you
[1:11:04] get up, it's a privilege.
[1:11:08] And uh I don't think I'm funny because
[1:11:11] when when when brother Bannon when he'll
[1:11:13] he'll talk about he says, you know, we
[1:11:15] take for ne we take for granted like
[1:11:17] even the sun, you talk about the sun
[1:11:19] coming up, nobody really ever thinks
[1:11:21] about, hey, the sun came up. Praise the
[1:11:23] Lord. But yet he says, you know, if it
[1:11:25] wasn't for the sun, we'd all die. If it
[1:11:27] didn't come springtime, we'd all die.
[1:11:29] Nothing would grow.
[1:11:33] Amen.
[1:11:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:39] Amen. So, how many believes that Jesus
[1:11:41] on Calvary
[1:11:43] paid He paid the price for every
[1:11:46] privilege that you ever have that you'll
[1:11:48] ever have. He paid for it. Thank you,
[1:11:52] [Applause]
[1:11:54] Jesus. That's right.
[1:12:01] Amen. My You want me to cover the scope
[1:12:03] of it? Let me cover Let me cover for you
[1:12:06] the scope of what your privileges are.
[1:12:08] Everything that you ever have need of or
[1:12:11] ever will have need. Even heaven itself
[1:12:14] has already been paid for you. There is
[1:12:18] not one thing that Jesus didn't pay for
[1:12:20] that you need that you'll ever need.
[1:12:22] Anything you'll ever need has already
[1:12:24] been paid for.
[1:12:26] We are a privileged people.
[1:12:36] Amen. Praise the
[1:12:39] Lord. Heavenly Father, brother Bam says,
[1:12:42] "We are indeed a privileged people this
[1:12:44] morning to be assembled in the house of
[1:12:47] God."
[1:12:49] How many know he's at one place, he
[1:12:50] says, "Someday they'll shut this place
[1:12:52] down.
[1:12:54] Someday you won't have the privilege.
[1:12:55] They'll shut it
[1:12:57] down. I tell you what, when I know that
[1:13:00] I have a privilege on something, it's
[1:13:02] free. You better take advantage of it.
[1:13:05] You better enjoy your privilege.
[1:13:10] What gives us the right to come here and
[1:13:13] to be an independent church? Brother
[1:13:14] Brian, he was mentioning England, you
[1:13:16] know, and all of the persecution that
[1:13:17] going on over
[1:13:19] there. Amen.
[1:13:22] Praise the
[1:13:23] Lord. By the way, I just want to comment
[1:13:25] on that what he said about being that
[1:13:27] oak tree. How many believes that that we
[1:13:30] as dads need to be or husbands, we need
[1:13:32] to be that oak tree for our wives? We
[1:13:35] need to be that sound foundation for our
[1:13:38] wife. Wife, you need to be that solid
[1:13:41] oak for your children.
[1:13:43] Grandpa, you need to be that solid oak
[1:13:46] for your wife, your children, and your
[1:13:48] children's children.
[1:13:50] pastor, you need to be for your
[1:13:52] congregation.
[1:13:53] Hello.
[1:13:55] That immovable rock that can only be
[1:13:57] attained by having a relationship with
[1:14:00] Jesus Christ.
[1:14:02] Amen. We need that. Appreciate the
[1:14:04] Sunday school this morning. Amen. Praise
[1:14:06] the Lord. So, we think about it. Let's
[1:14:08] just talk about first of all, you're
[1:14:11] privileged. How many know that you are a
[1:14:12] privileged person to live from what I
[1:14:15] understand in the greatest nation in the
[1:14:17] world yet? Amen.
[1:14:21] I don't know about you, but I'm glad
[1:14:22] that I'm not over in China.
[1:14:25] I'm glad I'm not I wasn't born in Russia
[1:14:28] or China where there's no freedom of
[1:14:30] religion and you preach like this and
[1:14:31] the cops are going to come walking up in
[1:14:33] them double doors. Hey y'all put your
[1:14:35] hands behind your back and go up against
[1:14:37] that wall. Y'all getting all arrested.
[1:14:42] Hello. Or over in the Middle East where
[1:14:44] they're killing a bunch of Christians
[1:14:46] right now. Ain't that right? Them folks
[1:14:48] are killing those Christians. They're
[1:14:50] dying.
[1:14:52] So, we're privileged.
[1:14:57] You're privileged this morning sitting
[1:14:59] in that seat.
[1:15:02] You're privileged to be an American.
[1:15:05] Let me ask you something. Was it cheap?
[1:15:08] Did it come free? No. The fact that I
[1:15:12] can come up here and preach a full
[1:15:13] gospel according to the dictates of a
[1:15:15] heart and you can sit there and listen
[1:15:17] and worship God the way that you want to
[1:15:19] was because some of those men that
[1:15:21] wanted to come for freedom of religion
[1:15:23] to a
[1:15:24] country. Hello. They bled and they died.
[1:15:29] I looked I picked it up. I thought, you
[1:15:31] know, think about World War I, World War
[1:15:33] II. Amen. how that Hitler would have
[1:15:35] taken over the world if he could have.
[1:15:36] Japan tried to take us over and
[1:15:41] 400,000 soldiers, American soldiers, got
[1:15:44] their heads blown off, got their iron
[1:15:46] blood, brutal battle on D-Day. Hello.
[1:15:49] All of that was so that you could sit
[1:15:51] there so that you could have freedom of
[1:15:54] religion. So that you could worship the
[1:15:57] Lord. Now you're a privileged person.
[1:16:00] They paid for your privilege.
[1:16:03] It ain't no wonder that we have a
[1:16:05] Memorial Day. I thought about having a
[1:16:07] moment of silence this morning to
[1:16:09] remember all those young men 18 years
[1:16:12] old. Paul, you're not 18 yet, but think
[1:16:14] about it. How'd you like to find out?
[1:16:16] You man, there's a heated battle going
[1:16:19] on with uh
[1:16:21] Russia or North Korea or somebody
[1:16:25] invading you. You boys, we need you.
[1:16:28] Most likely you're going to die.
[1:16:32] How'd you like to find out that you're
[1:16:34] going to be sent off to
[1:16:36] war? Huh? Michael, by your age,
[1:16:44] Danny. Off the war you
[1:16:46] go.
[1:16:48] Amen. Aren't you glad you Now, we've got
[1:16:51] some here that like Brother Brian,
[1:16:53] Brother Sean, Brother Glenn that served.
[1:16:59] Amen. I don't know what they all done.
[1:17:00] probably don't want to know, but it was
[1:17:02] for our country, for our
[1:17:05] freedom.
[1:17:07] Amen. That's right. So that we could
[1:17:10] worship God. So we could be free. To
[1:17:13] give you that privilege of coming to
[1:17:15] church on Sunday.
[1:17:21] I give the highest regard and highest
[1:17:24] respect to those who lost their lives.
[1:17:26] That's right. 18, 19, 20 years old. Men
[1:17:29] of all kind that are over on the other
[1:17:31] side. Now, we know they're not dead.
[1:17:34] Their souls over there somewhere in that
[1:17:36] dimension, either saved or unsaved.
[1:17:39] Isn't that right? They're there. And
[1:17:40] they forfeited their blood. They gave
[1:17:43] their life, forfeited their whole
[1:17:45] future.
[1:17:46] Hundreds of thousands of 400 thousand in
[1:17:49] World War II alone, let alone Korea and
[1:17:52] Vietnam and the places that they were.
[1:17:55] Those jungles of Vietnam and everywhere
[1:17:57] they fought.
[1:18:00] Amen. Some even senseless wars.
[1:18:05] Hello. Wars that we lost.
[1:18:08] I always thought it was a terrible thing
[1:18:10] to lose a war because if you lose and
[1:18:13] them guys paid for their paid for it for
[1:18:16] nothing. They didn't get nothing. They
[1:18:19] lost but they tried. Amen. But so I
[1:18:23] think my the highest of regard should go
[1:18:25] to those who have given their lives. No
[1:18:27] doubt no wonder we have a memorial
[1:18:30] day because they fight fought so that
[1:18:33] you could be privileged. Amen.
[1:18:36] to enjoy your
[1:18:38] freedoms and then people want to
[1:18:40] squander that and not take advantage of
[1:18:44] it. Amen. To give you the freedom of not
[1:18:48] have to be in China and work and have to
[1:18:51] be dressed in the clothes they give you,
[1:18:53] the house they give you. But he knows
[1:18:56] you can uh you can you can be a a bum on
[1:18:59] the street and be a pretty good one.
[1:19:01] Brother Bram says he's like a
[1:19:03] millionaire. At least you can find
[1:19:04] something to eat. Over in India and
[1:19:06] everywhere they they got big old bell
[1:19:07] round bellies of hungry and starving and
[1:19:10] skin and bones and everything. Hello.
[1:19:12] They can't find nothing to eat back
[1:19:14] then. I don't know how it is today. But
[1:19:16] you know even
[1:19:18] then you can be that or you can be Elon
[1:19:22] Musk or you can be Donald Trump or you
[1:19:26] can be a multi-millionaire
[1:19:29] if you're smart enough. Just depends on
[1:19:32] how smart you are,
[1:19:35] how determined you
[1:19:36] are. But there's no there's no limit to
[1:19:40] your success if you really put your mind
[1:19:42] to it. In other words, the opportunity
[1:19:45] is there. The privilege is there.
[1:19:52] Amen.
[1:19:54] Hallelujah. Just the little
[1:19:56] things. everybody, all the sinners out
[1:20:00] there. And I was thinking, we were
[1:20:02] sitting on the porch, me and my wife was
[1:20:03] sitting on the porch talking about the
[1:20:06] Lord, watching the beautiful clouds come
[1:20:12] by, huh?
[1:20:15] Enjoying our
[1:20:17] porch, enjoying what God
[1:20:21] made, watching the martins, sparrows or
[1:20:24] whatever. And I told her, I says,
[1:20:26] "Honey, you know, it's something. Isn't
[1:20:29] it
[1:20:31] something?" And I almost wanted to tell
[1:20:33] the guy at the Dairy Queen, I was almost
[1:20:36] went to preaching at the guy at the
[1:20:37] Dairy Queen drive-thru this morning, but
[1:20:39] I didn't. But he he said he ain't going
[1:20:42] to be at church. He was a pretty
[1:20:43] religious little fell. He was pretty
[1:20:45] pretty pretty decent young man. He says,
[1:20:47] "You know, I gota I couldn't go to
[1:20:49] church because I it would make him make
[1:20:52] them short-handed here. But Jesus knows
[1:20:54] I I love him. I'm going said, "You know
[1:20:57] what I'm going to preach about today?
[1:20:58] I'm going to talk about how that he
[1:20:59] says, you know how how this world turns
[1:21:01] around in in a 24-hour period. It does a
[1:21:04] perfect turn and we never even thank God
[1:21:07] for it. We don't realize that it's the
[1:21:08] power of God that makes every revolution
[1:21:12] of every day. He's the one that brings
[1:21:15] the clouds. He's the ones that paints us
[1:21:17] beautiful sunsets. He gives us birds to
[1:21:20] enjoy. He gives us nice weather. He does
[1:21:23] all of that. We're privileged to live on
[1:21:26] his great earth. All the earth is full
[1:21:30] of his glory. Brother Brandon preached a
[1:21:32] paradox. Said everything about the moon
[1:21:34] and the stars and all of that, it's all
[1:21:36] a paradox. It's all a miracle. You're
[1:21:39] living on a miracle. You're a privileged
[1:21:41] person. Even the sinners are privileged
[1:21:44] to live on God's green earth.
[1:21:47] Cuz when they go to hell, there ain't
[1:21:48] going to be no nothing there. No
[1:21:52] privileges in hell. We'll talk about the
[1:21:54] rich young man and different things here
[1:21:56] after a
[1:21:58] while. That's right. And I'll just touch
[1:22:01] him a little bit. I don't know about
[1:22:04] you,
[1:22:07] but I kind of like something to stand
[1:22:10] on. Don't you?
[1:22:12] What do you reckon it feel like if
[1:22:15] I
[1:22:17] fall? Sh. I got you, didn't I?
[1:22:22] It'd be scary to think, you know, when
[1:22:24] you're falling out of a tree. Oh man,
[1:22:27] it's a terrible thing. But brother
[1:22:28] Brandon on the reason to the lost. He
[1:22:30] said that's all he was doing. Falling
[1:22:32] and falling. Nothing solid to stand on.
[1:22:35] Just fall and fall in darkness. Moanful
[1:22:38] moanful sounds of people moaning and
[1:22:40] everything. A horrible place. Yet the
[1:22:44] sinners, listen, the sinners got to
[1:22:45] enjoy. Amen. To live on God's grace
[1:22:48] great earth. Amen. is full of the glory.
[1:22:50] How many believe the whole earth is full
[1:22:52] of his glory? The trees reflect his
[1:22:54] glory. The beautiful birds reflect his
[1:22:57] glory. The bird watchers to see the
[1:22:59] glory of
[1:23:04] God. Privileged to go to the beach.
[1:23:07] Privilege to take a hike in the
[1:23:09] mountains. Privileged. Ain't that right?
[1:23:12] People have great RV
[1:23:14] parks, recreational vehicles. Amen. go
[1:23:18] to parks and enjoy, but they never stop
[1:23:21] and thank God. Never appreciate who gave
[1:23:24] them that privilege in the first place.
[1:23:35] Amen. With that privilege comes
[1:23:38] responsibility. You're responsible for
[1:23:41] what you do with that privilege.
[1:23:44] Man, you out of a million was chosen to
[1:23:48] come to the earth to be
[1:23:51] born. I don't care if you're too fat. I
[1:23:54] don't care if you're too skinny. I don't
[1:23:56] care if you're too ugly. You still ought
[1:23:58] to be, "Well, hallelujah. I'm happy the
[1:24:00] way God made me. At least I got the
[1:24:07] cop." Don't have an inferior complex.
[1:24:10] No. God made you special.
[1:24:13] And he gave you life. He gave you
[1:24:15] breath.
[1:24:17] We thank God for it.
[1:24:22] God is the most
[1:24:24] unappreciated being in the universe.
[1:24:28] Huh? How many know straight is the gate
[1:24:31] and few is the few there is that find
[1:24:33] it? Fear not little flock. Sure. God's
[1:24:36] children, God's people appreciate him.
[1:24:39] Amen. Sure. There will be millions over
[1:24:42] the
[1:24:43] ages. But all those that are of the
[1:24:45] other side, they don't appreciate him.
[1:24:47] They don't give him thanks. The Bible
[1:24:50] said that God came to his own. His own
[1:24:52] received him. Not even his own disciples
[1:24:55] left
[1:24:55] him. Forsook
[1:24:58] him cuz he didn't have it in here
[1:25:01] without the Holy Ghost. They didn't have
[1:25:03] it in here to stay with him. Say, "Yeah,
[1:25:06] I'll go to Calvary, too."
[1:25:11] Amen. But
[1:25:13] anyway, so we think about it. In the
[1:25:16] natural world, we're privileged people.
[1:25:20] Everything you
[1:25:21] have has been given to you by God. Every
[1:25:24] breath that you have, you're privileged
[1:25:26] to breathe another breath. Amen. We want
[1:25:30] to look with the help of the Lord at
[1:25:32] different things like that. Amen. Praise
[1:25:35] the Lord. So he says, "That's right.
[1:25:39] You're privileged to be in the house of
[1:25:40] God." When we know that there's so many
[1:25:43] that would want to be in the house of
[1:25:44] God this morning and is in the hospital
[1:25:47] and on beds of
[1:25:49] sickness, he says, "And thou has given
[1:25:51] us this privilege to be out here
[1:25:55] today." Amen. How many believes it's a
[1:25:58] privilege to be here this morning?
[1:26:04] That's right. Hallelujah. And we don't
[1:26:07] come just to see each other. Amen.
[1:26:10] Though we love to fellowship one with
[1:26:12] another, but we come can do that at our
[1:26:14] homes, but we come here to fellowship
[1:26:16] with he who has brought us together as
[1:26:19] beloved children of God.
[1:26:22] Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh, in this hour
[1:26:26] of darkness and chaos over the earth, we
[1:26:29] should be the happiest people on the
[1:26:31] earth.
[1:26:32] to rejoice to know he says uh that all
[1:26:35] kinds of people are indoctrinated all
[1:26:38] kinds of isms and things on the world
[1:26:40] and yet today the living God by his word
[1:26:44] and his visible evidence shows us that
[1:26:47] he's here with us working moving and
[1:26:50] acting exactly like you are dead
[1:26:54] I don't know about you but I'm glad that
[1:26:56] I'm not Amish I'm not Menanite I'm not
[1:26:58] Baptist Presbyterian or any of those
[1:27:00] things we are a living God among
[1:27:06] us. That's why he
[1:27:08] come. What religion are you going to go
[1:27:11] to? What church are you going to go to?
[1:27:13] Amen. That can show you the very pillar
[1:27:15] of fire that let the children of Israel.
[1:27:17] Amen. The halo over their leaders in.
[1:27:20] Where are you going to go to find that?
[1:27:22] Nowhere around this world. Where are you
[1:27:24] going to find where there's a cloud that
[1:27:26] even the scientists said it was way too
[1:27:28] high for even for a moisture to be up
[1:27:31] there forming the perfect Hoffman's head
[1:27:33] of Christ looking down upon the earth.
[1:27:36] Seven angels coming with a message to
[1:27:38] the bride of Jesus Christ. Where are you
[1:27:40] going to find that? We ought to be the
[1:27:42] happiest people knowing God is with us.
[1:27:46] God is with you. God is here.
[1:27:53] That's why we ought to be the happiest
[1:27:54] people in the world. Amen. You're not
[1:27:56] Muhammad, he says. You're not Buddha.
[1:27:58] You're not Catholic. You're none of
[1:28:00] those
[1:28:01] indoctrinated. But here you have the
[1:28:03] living God among you proving himself.
[1:28:06] Oh, if I could shout that to the world,
[1:28:08] the church world, the living God came
[1:28:10] and proved himself in the prophet of
[1:28:13] God. He came to draw us back to himself.
[1:28:17] And that's the blessing, the privilege
[1:28:18] that we have. Amen. If God is drawing us
[1:28:23] and he to whom Amen will draw if the
[1:28:26] father will draw. How many is glad to be
[1:28:29] drawn? I'm glad my drawing is to God.
[1:28:32] I'm glad my drawing is the church. Amen.
[1:28:34] My drawing is to the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:43] greatest privilege that's ever been
[1:28:45] given to man was to allow God
[1:28:52] himself not to live among you. Hello.
[1:28:56] How many knows Jesus walked with the
[1:28:59] disciples? He was among them. Ain't that
[1:29:02] right? He was with them.
[1:29:06] But he said he is. He the the comforter
[1:29:08] is with you. But he shall
[1:29:12] be. He shall be in you. There's a big
[1:29:17] difference between him being there and
[1:29:19] him being here. My my my a big
[1:29:24] difference. God isn't here. This is
[1:29:27] where God dwells.
[1:29:30] That is where God dwells. That is where
[1:29:32] God dwells. That's where God dwells. God
[1:29:36] is
[1:29:36] here. We don't neglect him. God help us
[1:29:40] never to neglect. So great a salvation.
[1:29:43] God has given the whole world a free
[1:29:45] pass. Forgive them all their sins. He's
[1:29:48] given them that. But don't neglect it or
[1:29:50] you'll pay for it.
[1:30:01] Amen.
[1:30:12] It's a privilege to have health. I'm
[1:30:15] just glad to be healthy.
[1:30:19] Amen. Very thankful, Lord Jesus. Thank
[1:30:21] you for the health that you've given
[1:30:23] each one of us. Thank you for the
[1:30:26] strength. Thank you for strength.
[1:30:29] You'll know it when you get about 60 and
[1:30:31] you realize, hey, you can't lift them
[1:30:34] 200 lb anymore. You struggle with 50 lb.
[1:30:37] You realize you ain't got the strength.
[1:30:39] Your strength is
[1:30:40] fleeting. That's why Sister Janet's
[1:30:43] praying. Lord, give me
[1:30:45] strength. Just need strength right now.
[1:30:48] That's all I need. Sister Paris, I need
[1:30:51] strength. Lord, I need strength. I
[1:30:54] appreciate strength. God, grant them
[1:30:56] strength this morning.
[1:31:01] Why do you think that in Revelation it's
[1:31:03] our worthy of honor and glory and
[1:31:06] strength and power? It all belongs to
[1:31:08] him. You've been privileged with
[1:31:09] strength. You've been privileged with a
[1:31:11] voice. You've been privileged with being
[1:31:13] able to worship God.
[1:31:16] Lips to give praise to his name.
[1:31:20] Amen. I heard brother Bam said, man,
[1:31:22] what don't be so cold. Don't be so proud
[1:31:24] that you can't say amen.
[1:31:27] Come on, humble yourself a little bit
[1:31:29] and say, "Amen." Praise the Lord. I
[1:31:32] don't care what anybody else thinks. I'm
[1:31:34] going to punctuate the word with an
[1:31:43] amen. Cuz we're privileged beyond your
[1:31:47] imagination. We have untapped resources.
[1:31:51] We've been privileged with untapped
[1:31:53] resources.
[1:31:55] Hallelujah.
[1:31:57] Amen. Resources we never even tapped
[1:32:00] into. How many knows when Elijah and
[1:32:03] Gahesi was up on the mountain, the
[1:32:04] Syrian army came after him and they were
[1:32:07] surrounded by the Syrian
[1:32:09] army. Gahhesi says, "Man, what are we
[1:32:12] going to do? What are we going to do?
[1:32:14] Look at all of these guys." And as
[1:32:16] brother Bam says, he says, "What are you
[1:32:17] talking about? What are you talking
[1:32:19] about?" He said, "God, open my serpent's
[1:32:22] eyes." Amen. His eyes become open and he
[1:32:25] looked and they're all on the
[1:32:27] mountaintops and it was all of heaven on
[1:32:30] chariot of horses. He said there's more
[1:32:32] of us than there is of them. All of
[1:32:35] heaven is behind you. All of the
[1:32:38] resources of heaven stand behind every
[1:32:41] believer. Every son and daughter, God
[1:32:44] has got all of heaven
[1:32:47] behind. No wonder we ought to be the
[1:32:49] happiest people.
[1:32:55] No
[1:32:58] wonder we should be the happiest people
[1:33:02] on the
[1:33:08] planet. All right, I'll catch my breath.
[1:33:12] That all
[1:33:13] right?
[1:33:15] People lose their breath
[1:33:19] fleeing when nothing's chasing them.
[1:33:22] Might as well lose our breath preaching
[1:33:25] the
[1:33:27] gospel.
[1:33:29] Amen.
[1:33:31] Hallelujah. Oh, that's so good, isn't
[1:33:33] it? That's our resource. Heaven is our
[1:33:37] resources.
[1:33:41] You've been privileged cuz Jesus said,
[1:33:45] he said, "Ask and it shall be given unto
[1:33:48] you. Knock and it shall be open. Seek
[1:33:53] and you shall find." That's a privileged
[1:33:56] person. Ask and it shall be given unto
[1:33:59] you. Pray and God will answer your
[1:34:02] prayer. Believe with all of your heart
[1:34:04] and nothing shall be impossible.
[1:34:07] You're privileged to be at that place
[1:34:10] with God. We're privileged to be back
[1:34:14] the way that Adam was before the fall.
[1:34:20] Amen. We're still living a little below
[1:34:25] our God-given
[1:34:28] privileges. I don't know about you, but
[1:34:31] I want to get to the place where brother
[1:34:33] Brandon was.
[1:34:36] That's right. I believe he was so
[1:34:38] surrendered to God, so committed to God
[1:34:42] that God could trust with him. Trust him
[1:34:44] with that couple that was on the front
[1:34:46] row kissing and carrying on. Said,
[1:34:49] "Whatever you say to them, it'll
[1:34:52] happen." He knew that
[1:34:55] voice. He could have spoken. How many
[1:34:58] believes he could have said anything and
[1:35:01] it would have happened?
[1:35:05] Had he right? Could have said anything,
[1:35:08] it would have happened.
[1:35:11] Now ask what you want and you'll have
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:20] it. We ain't got no genie in no bottle.
[1:35:24] We got a God in the heart. Amen. that
[1:35:27] says asked anything and I will do
[1:35:32] it. That's not just for Hattie, right?
[1:35:35] This just comes fresh. Amen. He told
[1:35:39] her, "Ask what you will." Didn't the
[1:35:41] Bible say you ask what you will in my
[1:35:43] father's name and you'll have it. Let
[1:35:46] the Holy Ghost inspire you to speak like
[1:35:49] he did with Patty Wright. Let the Holy
[1:35:51] Ghost inspire you like he did with the
[1:35:54] brother Brandon and say the right thing.
[1:35:56] I forgive you for
[1:35:59] that. If Brother Brandon would had a
[1:36:01] mean bone in his body, if he'd had a
[1:36:04] little angry bone in his body, if he'd
[1:36:06] have been a little
[1:36:07] deaconyy, hey, you can't do that, huh?
[1:36:11] Come on. Come out here. We're going to
[1:36:13] have a talk with you. Huh? Deacon's got
[1:36:15] to be a little tough, please. But if he
[1:36:17] had a little bit of that, ain't no
[1:36:19] telling what he might have said. But he
[1:36:21] had the love of God in his
[1:36:24] heart. Hello. He realized how many times
[1:36:27] he had messed up. Ain't that right? That
[1:36:30] he was also needing forgiveness. Blessed
[1:36:33] are the merciful. He says, "If they
[1:36:35] shall obtain mercy," he says, "I forgive
[1:36:38] you for that." I still want to see it,
[1:36:40] Brother Glenn. I want the tape played
[1:36:41] back. I want to see the reaction on that
[1:36:44] couple when he said
[1:36:49] that because I can imagine if there was
[1:36:53] a conviction of almighty God come down.
[1:36:58] I don't know just what it was. That's
[1:36:59] why I want to see it. Maybe they were
[1:37:01] still arrogant, but they better not have
[1:37:03] been. But I'm here to tell you those
[1:37:06] preachers back there when he says, "Come
[1:37:07] up here and stand by my side," that was
[1:37:09] one quiet bunch. They realized that they
[1:37:12] were they're going to they're
[1:37:13] confronting God's hand, right hand man.
[1:37:17] And none of them dared get up out of
[1:37:19] feet and come on up here. I imagine
[1:37:21] there was a holy hush, a reverence, a
[1:37:23] fear, cuz if you make the wrong move,
[1:37:26] somebody in here is going to die.
[1:37:29] It was that kind of atmosphere.
[1:37:36] Oh, go ahead, brother Brandon. I'll be
[1:37:39] by your side.
[1:37:41] right side.
[1:37:48] How many wants to live up to your
[1:37:50] God-given privileges?
[1:37:52] Our rights are God-given privileges is
[1:37:55] to walk with God, to be so committed to
[1:37:59] him that if you need a bull to go back,
[1:38:02] if you need a storm to stop, if you need
[1:38:04] hornets to go back in, Amen. that God
[1:38:06] can do that for you. Not just for the
[1:38:09] prophet, but for you and I. But it's
[1:38:11] going to take some surrenderance on our
[1:38:13] part. It's going to take a committal to
[1:38:15] our part. It's going to take believing
[1:38:17] God's word.
[1:38:23] Amen. That's what I want more of. I want
[1:38:28] more of Jesus. I want closer to God. I
[1:38:31] want closer and closer and closer to God
[1:38:32] until I am in his very presence. I'm
[1:38:35] talking about physically. How many's
[1:38:36] looking for a rapture?
[1:38:43] privileged
[1:38:46] people.
[1:38:51] Behold, what manner of
[1:38:53] love the father has bestowed upon us
[1:38:57] that we should be called the children of
[1:39:00] God.
[1:39:03] How many glad to be a child of God?
[1:39:08] Amen. Praise the
[1:39:12] Lord. Brother says, "Let us remain
[1:39:15] standing just a moment for prayer as we
[1:39:17] bow our heads. Our gracious heavenly
[1:39:19] father, we are indeed a privileged
[1:39:22] people tonight that we can look into thy
[1:39:24] glorious face and to call thee our
[1:39:28] father."
[1:39:31] Woo! How many's glad and proud of your
[1:39:35] heavenly father?
[1:39:37] We have a great heavenly
[1:39:45] father.
[1:39:46] Amen. That we do, don't we? Praise the
[1:39:50] Lord.
[1:40:00] Therefore I say unto you, take no
[1:40:02] thought for your life, what you shall
[1:40:04] eat, or neither what for the body of
[1:40:06] what you shall put on. The life is more
[1:40:08] than the meat. Amen. Hallelujah. How
[1:40:12] many knows you being alive in the heaven
[1:40:14] of God on the inside is more than any
[1:40:17] external thing. much greater than your
[1:40:20] clothes, much greater than your food,
[1:40:23] much greater than your house, much
[1:40:25] greater than your daily needs. Lord,
[1:40:27] help us. We take so good care of the
[1:40:30] outside, but it's time to tend to the
[1:40:32] soul.
[1:40:37] Consider the ravens, for they neither
[1:40:39] sow nor do they reap. They which they
[1:40:42] neither have storehouses nor barns, and
[1:40:46] God feedth them, how much more are ye
[1:40:48] better than fowls? And which of you
[1:40:50] taking thought can add one stature to
[1:40:52] his cubit? And if ye then be not able to
[1:40:55] do one thing of the least, why take ye
[1:40:57] thought for the rest? Consider the liies
[1:41:00] how they grow. They twirl not, neither
[1:41:01] do they spin. Yet I say that all of
[1:41:03] Solomon was not a raid, and all of his
[1:41:05] glory was not a raid like one of
[1:41:07] these. Oh, this is just a little fresh
[1:41:10] revelation. Is this okay? Amen. And then
[1:41:12] Solomon, sure he was arrayed in all
[1:41:15] kinds of things, but guess what? The
[1:41:16] believer is arrayed in the caretaking of
[1:41:19] heavenly father. God takes care of us.
[1:41:22] That's the glory of the almighty God.
[1:41:25] God takes care of us. Amen. Then if God
[1:41:29] so clothe the grass which is today in
[1:41:30] the field and tomorrow's casting in, how
[1:41:32] much will he not clothe you, oh ye of
[1:41:34] little faith? Amen. Seek not that what
[1:41:37] ye shall eat or drink of what and
[1:41:39] neither be of a doubtful mind. For all
[1:41:41] these things do the nations of the world
[1:41:43] seek after and your father knoweth that
[1:41:45] you have need of these things, but
[1:41:47] rather seek to eat the kingdom of God
[1:41:48] and all and of God and all these things
[1:41:51] shall be added unto you. How many
[1:41:54] believes you are a privileged person
[1:41:55] this morning cuz God takes care of you.
[1:41:58] If you need a job, God will give you a
[1:42:00] job. If you need something else, God
[1:42:02] will give it to you. If you'll just make
[1:42:04] him first in your life, you know, God
[1:42:06] will supply what you have need of. We're
[1:42:09] privileged to have a heavenly father
[1:42:10] like we
[1:42:12] do.
[1:42:14] Amen. But says, "You never seen a robin
[1:42:17] and all of them ambulances. You don't
[1:42:19] see no two birds carrying Amen. two feet
[1:42:22] in a little bitty old uh stretcher
[1:42:24] between them and coming over to another
[1:42:26] bird and three, four of them load that
[1:42:29] bird up in a little stretch and off they
[1:42:31] go."
[1:42:32] Well, where are they going? They're
[1:42:33] going to the bird hospital. No, never
[1:42:36] seen any of that. Why? Cuz God takes
[1:42:38] care of them. Amen. Brother B says every
[1:42:41] morning you get up and man, they go tilt
[1:42:42] their head back and sing to the top of
[1:42:44] their voice just a praising God. Amen.
[1:42:47] They're looking down at humanity and
[1:42:49] say, "Why are people so sad? Why are
[1:42:51] people so down? Don't they have a
[1:42:54] heavenly father like we do?" Woo!
[1:42:59] Oh my, what a privilege. Hallelujah.
[1:43:04] You're a privilege because you're locked
[1:43:06] in. You're sealed in with God. You're
[1:43:08] God's child.
[1:43:12] Amen. When you go through struggles and
[1:43:15] trials, how many of us can look back in
[1:43:18] our lives and see the hardships that
[1:43:21] we've went through? We come
[1:43:24] through. Amen. Like brother Bam says,
[1:43:26] "Brother Bam, did you keep your
[1:43:27] religion?" No, I didn't. But it kept me.
[1:43:30] We've got a God that keeps us, that
[1:43:33] holds on to us, that don't let us go.
[1:43:36] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[1:43:38] you. Thank you. He will not let you
[1:43:41] go. That's the privilege that we have.
[1:43:45] That is our privilege. He won't let you
[1:43:47] go.
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:43:59] I don't know. Sometimes I say everything
[1:44:00] I should or not. It comes to my mind up
[1:44:02] here.
[1:44:12] I'm asking his permission in case you're
[1:44:14] wondering why I'm
[1:44:21] waiting. That's my wonderful wife back
[1:44:24] there. Thank the Lord.
[1:44:27] All right, we'll leave that one alone at
[1:44:30] this time. But the devil has tried
[1:44:33] everything for you to try to get you to
[1:44:36] stop. Ain't that right? To get me to
[1:44:39] stop. To discourage me to discourage
[1:44:41] you. Young people, don't think that
[1:44:44] you're not going to go through rough
[1:44:45] times. You're going to get to places
[1:44:48] where you want to maybe quit or this
[1:44:49] person discourages you or that person
[1:44:51] discourage. That don't stop you. No. If
[1:44:54] you really got a new birth experience,
[1:45:00] let's be honest, you might have a grudge
[1:45:02] for years. You might have a problem for
[1:45:05] years. It can happen with Christians.
[1:45:11] But if you're God's child, you will
[1:45:14] repent and you'll take chastisement and
[1:45:17] you'll take correction. Cuz if you don't
[1:45:20] take correction and if you don't
[1:45:21] straighten up, you're a bastard child,
[1:45:24] not a son of God.
[1:45:27] Amen.
[1:45:29] Sometimes it's a long road. Let's hope
[1:45:30] it don't take many years or time or a
[1:45:32] year or whatever. Hello. But sometimes
[1:45:34] it does.
[1:45:39] Amen. Remember that. Okay.
[1:45:44] Praise the
[1:45:46] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:45:51] See how many knows that when Jesus said
[1:45:54] it is
[1:45:56] finished, the price was paid
[1:45:59] for these privileges that we have, the
[1:46:01] price was paid. I don't have my
[1:46:03] checkbook with me, which I did. But for
[1:46:05] that checkbook, for you to have God's
[1:46:07] checkbook, the price was paid. The money
[1:46:10] was put in the bank. Ain't that right?
[1:46:14] And you were given a
[1:46:16] right to the tree of life. You was given
[1:46:19] a right to the checkbook. You were given
[1:46:22] a
[1:46:23] right. You were
[1:46:25] privileged to be
[1:46:27] able to obtain, to possess, to claim
[1:46:32] every promise in the
[1:46:36] book. The rapture, brother Woody, is
[1:46:38] mine. The body translation is mine. I
[1:46:41] claim it.
[1:46:44] The meeting in the air is ours, Brother
[1:46:46] Woody. We claim it. It's
[1:46:49] ours. Every promise in the book is mine.
[1:46:53] He said he'd never leave me nor forsake
[1:46:56] me. That promise is
[1:46:57] mine. I've got a right to
[1:47:00] it. I've got a privilege to
[1:47:03] [Applause]
[1:47:06] it. Well, why ain't you rich? Why don't
[1:47:09] give me God give me a million dollars?
[1:47:13] Why do they do this, that, or the other?
[1:47:15] Maybe he can't trust you with it. You
[1:47:17] ought to be content with the things that
[1:47:19] God does give you.
[1:47:27] Hello. A lot of us probably say, "We got
[1:47:30] too much stuff." Brother Tommy, I got
[1:47:31] too much stuff. I need to have a garage
[1:47:36] sale. I need to have a yard sale. I
[1:47:39] don't have time to keep up with a lot of
[1:47:41] that junk.
[1:47:44] Hello. Less is more sometimes. More time
[1:47:48] for God.
[1:47:50] But I thought, Lord, help us. Thank you,
[1:47:52] Lord Jesus, for paying for it. Free. How
[1:47:56] many know that's free? Jesus says, you
[1:47:58] go out there and you freely
[1:48:01] give because you have freely received.
[1:48:05] He paid the debt. You didn't. You didn't
[1:48:07] have to suffer for
[1:48:08] it. Oh my, I want to scream this to the
[1:48:11] world. Jesus said, "Come unto me." The
[1:48:15] spirit and the bride said, "Come, come,
[1:48:17] come, come." All you got to do is come
[1:48:19] in. All you got to do is
[1:48:22] come. All you got to do is believe.
[1:48:24] That's all. You don't have to go to
[1:48:27] hell. You can come to Christ and live
[1:48:29] [Applause]
[1:48:32] eternally. So
[1:48:34] simple, so free.
[1:48:36] and that people don't want
[1:48:44] it. Oh, but instead they'll go on the
[1:48:48] streets of Philadelphia and get in this
[1:48:50] crack cocaine and everything else and be
[1:48:52] hunched over out in the middle somewhere
[1:48:54] freaking out and everything else just
[1:48:56] for some high. Can I say amen? You can
[1:48:59] have your drugs, you can have your
[1:49:00] alcohol, you can have your devil stuff.
[1:49:02] That is a false sense of happiness. I'll
[1:49:05] take this stuff right here. I'll take
[1:49:08] this right here. The baptism of the Holy
[1:49:11] Ghost that gives me peace that passes
[1:49:14] understanding, joy
[1:49:17] unspeakable and full of
[1:49:21] glory. Full of
[1:49:23] glory. Come to church and tell me some
[1:49:25] more of that glory. Give me some more of
[1:49:28] that
[1:49:31] glory. Give me some more of that. I want
[1:49:34] some more of that. Raise your hand. Say,
[1:49:36] "God, give me more. Give me
[1:49:38] more. I want more, Lord. I want more of
[1:49:42] Jesus. More and more and more. I want
[1:49:45] more of Jesus.
[1:49:48] So, I'll give you more of me."
[1:49:51] Got to open more doors.
[1:49:55] Got to let him search your
[1:49:58] closet. See if he can't make room.
[1:50:23] In this world, you're
[1:50:26] privileged to try to get rich if you
[1:50:29] can. Amen. If you want to. And there's
[1:50:32] nothing wrong with being
[1:50:34] rich. Just be careful how high how how
[1:50:37] rich.
[1:50:38] Hello. Because if you go beyond what
[1:50:41] God beyond God's
[1:50:44] will, you'll make that's your treasure.
[1:50:47] That's where your heart will be. And
[1:50:49] you'll make it to where, like Jesus
[1:50:51] said, it's easier for the camel to go
[1:50:52] through the eye of a needle than for a
[1:50:54] rich man to enter into
[1:50:57] heaven. You have the privilege of
[1:50:59] getting rich if you want.
[1:51:07] Sometimes they think I just like to get
[1:51:08] rid of my cows, my dogs, my cats,
[1:51:12] anything that's a bunch of
[1:51:14] responsibility. Let me just go take a
[1:51:16] few of my my years and do a little
[1:51:18] fishing, rest, you know, not every day
[1:51:21] have to go and work, work, work, work.
[1:51:24] Let me enjoy what I've worked for. But
[1:51:27] instead, I'm going to put another
[1:51:28] addition up somewhere. I'm going to
[1:51:30] build this that or the other. You know,
[1:51:32] probably till I drop over off of a raft
[1:51:34] or somewhere, you know, who
[1:51:37] knows? But Lord, help me. You all pray
[1:51:40] for
[1:51:42] me. I take time out to study and pray.
[1:51:47] When I am working, play, push, play,
[1:51:50] keep my mind on God.
[1:51:53] Amen.
[1:51:54] The reason I said that is because I want
[1:51:57] to read you a little story now as we
[1:52:03] go. How many knows there's a price that
[1:52:06] comes for neglecting this great
[1:52:09] salvation or rejecting this great
[1:52:12] salvation? This great salvation that God
[1:52:14] has given the world free come and then
[1:52:19] to not accept
[1:52:20] it. It's almost mind-boggling to think
[1:52:24] that people don't want
[1:52:28] it. Can I make a statement? Yeah, I can.
[1:52:31] Thank you very much. Y'all voted me in
[1:52:32] to do that, didn't you? There's
[1:52:35] something
[1:52:36] wrong down here with a person that just
[1:52:40] doesn't want it.
[1:52:42] It's something in the soul. They got a
[1:52:44] soul problem, a seed problem.
[1:52:47] Huh?
[1:52:49] to want something this
[1:52:51] great. All right, let me hurry up
[1:52:55] here. Let me see
[1:52:58] here. Luke
[1:53:05] 16. Luke 16. Luke 12. Let's go to Luke
[1:53:10] 12 first.
[1:53:18] Luke 12:13 it says in one of the comp
[1:53:21] well let's wait go uh yeah that's fine
[1:53:23] 13 chapter 12 verse 13 and one of the
[1:53:25] company said unto him master speak to my
[1:53:27] brother that he divide the inheritance
[1:53:29] with me and he said unto him man who
[1:53:32] made me do you a ruler over a judge or a
[1:53:34] divider over you amen this is where I
[1:53:36] get my scripture don't anybody here ever
[1:53:38] ask me oh brother Balor will you step in
[1:53:40] we we're dividing inheritance and can
[1:53:42] you step in and help us nope
[1:53:45] Nope. It's all yours. Hopefully, nobody
[1:53:47] has that problem. But if you do, Jesus,
[1:53:49] don't do that. Amen. And he said unto
[1:53:52] them, "Take heed and beware of
[1:53:53] covetousness, for a man's life does not
[1:53:55] consist of the things and the abundance
[1:53:56] of things that he
[1:53:58] possesseth." Amen. How many knows your
[1:54:01] joy, your
[1:54:04] peace doesn't depend on how much you
[1:54:06] got?
[1:54:08] And he spake a parable unto them,
[1:54:10] saying, "The ground of a certain man
[1:54:11] brought m plentiful." And he thought
[1:54:14] within himself, saying, "What shall I do
[1:54:15] because I have no room where to bestow
[1:54:17] my fruits?" And he said, "This will I
[1:54:19] do? I will pull down my barns, will
[1:54:21] build greater, and there will I bestow
[1:54:23] all my fruits and my goods. And I will
[1:54:25] say to my soul, Saul, thou has much
[1:54:27] goods laid up for many years. Take thine
[1:54:30] knees, drink, eat, drink, and be
[1:54:34] merry." And God said unto him, Thou
[1:54:37] fool, this night thy soul shall be
[1:54:40] required of thee. Then whose shall these
[1:54:43] though things be which thou hast
[1:54:45] provided? So is he that layeth up
[1:54:47] treasure for himself and is not rich
[1:54:49] towards God.
[1:54:51] Amen.
[1:54:54] He made the
[1:54:56] mistake of thinking that he had another
[1:54:59] day. How many we as believers, we like
[1:55:02] to think, hey, you know, I may not
[1:55:04] finish this sermon. You may not make it
[1:55:07] home.
[1:55:09] So we want to make sure that we're in
[1:55:11] somebody's hands and in anybody's care
[1:55:13] if we don't. We don't have to let that
[1:55:15] scare us. How many know that doesn't
[1:55:17] fear? We don't have fear. That's
[1:55:19] something else we're privileged not to
[1:55:21] have to have. That's fear that's been
[1:55:23] taken from us. But we realize that we've
[1:55:26] been not given a promise of tomorrow. He
[1:55:28] thought he would have a life of ease. He
[1:55:30] would retire and have an easy day.
[1:55:34] didn't
[1:55:34] realize that he could be gone before
[1:55:37] morning.
[1:55:39] How many knows we're not always going to
[1:55:42] be here?
[1:55:44] You're not always going to be here. This
[1:55:45] is not going to keep going like this.
[1:55:48] Amen. We have to think ahead. Think
[1:55:51] prepare for what's ahead. Amen. Every
[1:55:56] day. Another story. There was a certain
[1:56:00] rich man which was clothed in purple and
[1:56:02] fine linen, fared presumptuously every
[1:56:05] day. This is in chapter 16
[1:56:08] 19. And there was a certain beggar named
[1:56:10] Lazarus which had laid at his gate full
[1:56:12] of the sores and desiring to be fed with
[1:56:14] the crumbs which fell from the rich
[1:56:16] man's table. Moreover, the dogs came and
[1:56:19] licked his sores. And it came to pass
[1:56:21] that as the beggar died and was carried
[1:56:24] by the angels of to Abraham's bosom, the
[1:56:27] rich man also died and was buried. Ain't
[1:56:29] it something how that Jesus would use
[1:56:31] this
[1:56:32] illustration? Basically, I want to tell
[1:56:34] you, he's telling you it's better to be
[1:56:36] a beggar on the street and to be a
[1:56:39] Christian than it is to be to have
[1:56:41] everything that you can have and imagine
[1:56:44] having wanting without God. How many
[1:56:46] believes that? Because that's pretty
[1:56:49] much what Jesus and the disciples were,
[1:56:51] beggars. Jesus says, "I have the son of
[1:56:53] foxes have holes and birds have nests.
[1:56:55] Son has nowhere to lay his head." Amen.
[1:56:58] He lived day by day. But if God is with
[1:57:01] you, he will supply for you. Amen.
[1:57:04] That's what I That's what I get out of
[1:57:06] this. And in hell, he lifted up his eyes
[1:57:09] being in torment and seeth Abraham a far
[1:57:11] off and Lazarus in his bosom. And he
[1:57:14] cried and said, "Father Abraham, have
[1:57:15] mercy on me." and send Lazarus that he
[1:57:17] may dip the tip of his finger in water
[1:57:19] and cool my tongue for I am tormented in
[1:57:22] this flame in life. He had the privilege
[1:57:25] of having
[1:57:26] everything. Now he don't even have the
[1:57:29] privilege of one drop of water on his
[1:57:33] tormented tongue.
[1:57:35] Hell has no privileges.
[1:57:39] No privileges down there. No
[1:57:42] peace, no
[1:57:44] love, no God.
[1:57:49] Then brother Bam says, he says, "Mom,
[1:57:52] dad, there's no mom. There was no dad.
[1:57:55] God, there was no God
[1:57:57] there."
[1:57:59] Huh? Wow. It's total separation from
[1:58:02] God. He had been in both
[1:58:06] places. And Abraham said, "Son, remember
[1:58:08] thou and thy lifetime receivest thy good
[1:58:10] things, and last likewise Lazarus's evil
[1:58:12] things. But now he is comforted, and
[1:58:14] thou art tormented. And by this, besides
[1:58:17] this, between us and you, there is a
[1:58:20] great gulf fixed, so that they which
[1:58:22] would pass from hence to you cannot,
[1:58:24] neither can they pass through us that
[1:58:27] would come from thence." And he said, I
[1:58:29] pray thee therefore, Father, that thou
[1:58:31] would send Lazarus, send him to my
[1:58:33] father's
[1:58:34] house, for I have five brethren, that he
[1:58:38] may testify unto them, least they also
[1:58:40] come in into this place of torment." And
[1:58:44] Abraham said unto him, they have Moses
[1:58:46] and the prophets. Let them hear them.
[1:58:48] And he said, Nay, Father Abraham, yet if
[1:58:51] one went unto them from the dead, they
[1:58:53] will repent.
[1:58:58] Wow. How many knows he wanted one more
[1:59:01] opportunity? He'd have loved to have the
[1:59:05] privilege of going telling his
[1:59:09] brothers. Can you imagine if this rich
[1:59:11] man was actually raised up? God granted
[1:59:13] him to be raised up from the dead and go
[1:59:16] to his brothers and say, "I was
[1:59:19] there. I was there."
[1:59:24] Make sure that you accept Christ. Make
[1:59:26] sure you accept God. Repent. You don't
[1:59:30] want to go there. He'd shake his
[1:59:32] brothers, wouldn't he? You got to hear
[1:59:34] me. You got to hear
[1:59:35] me. Maybe they're drunkers and smokers
[1:59:38] and drugs and adulterers and everything
[1:59:40] else. And you can't do that. Give your
[1:59:42] life to God. He'd all of a sudden become
[1:59:45] a missionary. He said, "Testify.
[1:59:47] Testify." He testify.
[1:59:50] How many believes it's an honor to
[1:59:52] testify about God here?
[1:59:55] Amen. This is people are hearing this
[1:59:57] now.
[1:59:58] God came in our generation. He does
[2:00:00] miracles among us. He did it in brother
[2:00:02] Brandham's ministry.
[2:00:05] So many people raised from the dead.
[2:00:07] Where is everybody at? God did raise
[2:00:10] people back up, but they still won't
[2:00:13] hear it.
[2:00:17] still won't take the
[2:00:19] opportunity to accept the privileges
[2:00:23] that God has for him.
[2:00:27] Amen. That's right. Listen, his visible
[2:00:32] evidence shows us that he's here with
[2:00:34] us, working, moving, acting just like he
[2:00:36] always has and always
[2:00:38] did. What a privileged people we are to
[2:00:42] have this. Oh, we
[2:00:45] ought, he says, to hold fast to these
[2:00:48] things because how shall we escape if we
[2:00:51] neglect so great uh salvation? How many
[2:00:54] know this generation will not neglect
[2:00:57] and will
[2:00:58] not escape
[2:01:01] judgment for neglecting and
[2:01:05] rejecting what God did in this
[2:01:07] generation.
[2:01:12] Amen.
[2:01:13] Did you ever stop to think what a
[2:01:16] privileged people we are of this
[2:01:18] day? Living in the closing of this
[2:01:21] world's history. Living in a time when
[2:01:23] all kinds of isms and creeds and things
[2:01:25] is going on. And yet in the midst of it
[2:01:27] all, our God rides on the waves and
[2:01:30] confirms his word
[2:01:33] right before
[2:01:35] us. Thank God that he rose the wave with
[2:01:40] healing in his wings. power of God.
[2:01:43] Signs in the skies, signs in the
[2:01:47] cameras, signs in the congregation,
[2:01:50] signs and wonders everywhere to give you
[2:01:53] that confidence to know that God is
[2:01:56] real.
[2:01:58] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:02] That's
[2:02:03] right. Now, we're just gloriously and
[2:02:06] very, very thankful for what he has done
[2:02:08] for us. The great mysterious hand of the
[2:02:10] living God. What greater thing could be?
[2:02:12] How much more of a privileged people
[2:02:13] could we be than been to have him, the
[2:02:16] presence of the King in our midst, the
[2:02:19] Lord of Lords, the King of Kings. How
[2:02:22] many believes that the greatest thing
[2:02:23] that you can have, the greatest
[2:02:26] privilege that you have is not just
[2:02:29] coming to church here, hearing sermons,
[2:02:31] but it's that Jesus is living with you.
[2:02:35] Jesus is living in you. He goes home
[2:02:39] with you. He goes to bed with you. He
[2:02:41] drives in the car with you. He goes
[2:02:43] everywhere with
[2:02:45] you. That's the greatest privilege we
[2:02:48] have is to have the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:50] Ghost in our hearts.
[2:02:53] That's the greatest privilege. What a
[2:02:55] privileged people we are.
[2:02:58] Satan hates that. That's why he tries to
[2:03:00] get you to mess up to grieve the Holy
[2:03:02] Ghost somehow. Give him a black eye if
[2:03:04] you have. Repent. Say, "God, I repent.
[2:03:08] take come back into my heart. What
[2:03:10] greater a
[2:03:11] privilege?
[2:03:13] Amen. Why? We would probably blow
[2:03:15] whistles and white flags and lay down on
[2:03:17] carpets and everything if the president
[2:03:19] of the United Nations comes by.
[2:03:24] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:03:31] Hallelujah. But what a privileged
[2:03:34] people. Remember sers what time it is.
[2:03:37] Something's fixing to happen major. The
[2:03:39] whole nation testified. Newspaper, the
[2:03:41] Associated Press.
[2:03:44] Amen. Hello. They all packed it. One of
[2:03:48] our healing magazines, everything else
[2:03:49] testifying about it. It's all over and
[2:03:52] yet again. But what a privileged
[2:03:55] people that the Christian is to know
[2:03:58] that in this dark hour when there's no
[2:04:03] hopes. How many know Reb says there's no
[2:04:06] hope for this world but fire? There's no
[2:04:09] hope for this world but the coming of
[2:04:11] the Lord. How many believe that it is
[2:04:13] such a privilege to know that you are
[2:04:16] anchored that you have got a hold of
[2:04:17] that rope, that one hope, just one hope.
[2:04:21] That's the only thing that's left is the
[2:04:22] hope of Jesus Christ. And you've got
[2:04:24] that
[2:04:26] hope. What a privileged people. It's
[2:04:30] going down, but you're not going down
[2:04:32] with
[2:04:33] it. You're going
[2:04:37] up. We're going up, not
[2:04:39] down. Woo!
[2:04:43] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. How many
[2:04:46] glad for that?
[2:04:51] I would say I'm sorry for getting a
[2:04:52] little emotional, but I'm not sorry.
[2:04:56] I think it's okay. Don't you? That's
[2:04:59] right. No hope. According to science,
[2:05:01] there's an atomic bomb waiting for us.
[2:05:03] No hopes in the our organizations of
[2:05:05] ever getting together. Amen. When all of
[2:05:07] our hopes that way is gone in our
[2:05:12] economy. Amen. But those who love God
[2:05:15] and are looking for the reality, the
[2:05:17] very God who made the promise in the
[2:05:20] Bible,
[2:05:22] Amen, spreads it before our face and
[2:05:24] makes the church, the people, the
[2:05:26] science, the magazines, and everything.
[2:05:29] Recognize it. It's there for the whole
[2:05:32] world to see. They ought to have this on
[2:05:34] television every day. They ought to
[2:05:37] broadcast this. They ought to broadcast
[2:05:38] that. what God has done in our
[2:05:40] generation. They ought to be playing the
[2:05:42] tapes.
[2:05:44] Amen. It's instead of showing Hollywood,
[2:05:46] they ought to be playing the tapes to
[2:05:48] the world. It'll be a different place.
[2:05:50] This world be a different place. Our
[2:05:51] young people will be a different place.
[2:05:54] Elon Musk the other day says he said he
[2:05:56] stays up at night and whatever. He says,
[2:05:58] "Humanity is dying." And I wanted to
[2:06:01] pull a quote up. Brother Bam says, "Man,
[2:06:02] if our teenagers go the way they are,
[2:06:04] Amen, in the next generation they'll
[2:06:06] become extinct." He's exactly right.
[2:06:08] Humanity is dying. But here's a group of
[2:06:12] people getting ready to Aren't you glad
[2:06:14] that you're that one of that front of
[2:06:16] you? Our morality is not dying. Our
[2:06:19] shield's not dying. Our love ain't
[2:06:24] dying. Hallelujah. In
[2:06:28] closing. That's right.
[2:06:31] If he could have had just another
[2:06:33] opportunity, another
[2:06:35] privilege. All those How many knows? All
[2:06:38] those in hell.
[2:06:39] Michael Michael
[2:06:45] Jackson. Thank you. Michael Jackson,
[2:06:48] Elvis Presley. Can you imagine them guys
[2:06:50] if they right now over there, they get
[2:06:52] another chance?
[2:06:56] Sure. There's nothing there, folks.
[2:07:01] For what I from what I from what brother
[2:07:03] Brandham tells
[2:07:05] me I'm glad he brings the thought.
[2:07:08] Brother Brandham says you know hell it's
[2:07:10] not just about a literal
[2:07:13] fire say he says a literal fire would be
[2:07:16] a pleasure that what he said compared to
[2:07:19] what that
[2:07:24] is. I don't know about you but I don't
[2:07:26] ever want to feel it.
[2:07:29] I never want a taste of
[2:07:30] that. I don't want to know. I don't ever
[2:07:33] want to know what it's like
[2:07:35] there. No God there. No peace. No
[2:07:42] joy. There is something else. There is
[2:07:44] something there. You know what that is?
[2:07:47] Remembrance. Brother Brand says there's
[2:07:49] hell. There's remembrance in hell.
[2:07:51] There's remembrance in the grave.
[2:07:53] Remember in thy lifetime. Yeah. You had
[2:07:56] it good and th had it bad. everything.
[2:07:58] And there they sit. There you
[2:08:01] sit. Knowing there they sit, billions of
[2:08:04] them,
[2:08:06] knowing that they're going to be raised
[2:08:08] up, that they're going to have to stand
[2:08:10] before God and give an account for
[2:08:12] everything they have ever
[2:08:17] done. I want to say I I imagine going
[2:08:20] beyond the curtain of time. I imagine
[2:08:22] going over there is convincing to people
[2:08:25] to realize, hey, there is a God. I'm not
[2:08:27] even dead
[2:08:31] here. Isn't it something people that'll
[2:08:34] kill themselves and realize they didn't
[2:08:36] die? They just went in the most terrible
[2:08:39] worst
[2:08:41] place. Yeah, it's a
[2:08:43] mistake.
[2:08:46] Amen. All right, let me stay on track.
[2:08:50] No hopes in the economy and so forth. No
[2:08:52] hopes in the economy. Mega, make America
[2:08:56] great
[2:08:58] again. I like the
[2:09:00] slogan. I like
[2:09:02] it. But, Brother B, you're political. I
[2:09:05] am a little I'm an American. All right.
[2:09:08] They're sure political. They're burning
[2:09:10] cars for their
[2:09:11] politicalness. Burn them Teslas,
[2:09:14] right? So, if I burn them a little bit
[2:09:17] up here, it'd be all
[2:09:18] right. Make America great again. Oh,
[2:09:21] it's a Nazi. It's Nazi symbol. Really?
[2:09:24] Really? Make America great? It's a Nazi.
[2:09:27] What? How brain dead are you? That's
[2:09:30] really what he wants to do is make
[2:09:31] America great again. And you call it
[2:09:35] Nazism. I sure don't need you up in
[2:09:39] there. Oh boy. How do you like how much
[2:09:43] money they
[2:09:44] stole? They stole a bunch of money. How
[2:09:49] many times did
[2:09:50] they got another spending? Oh, one of
[2:09:53] them was to what was it? To boost the
[2:09:55] economy or something. It wasn't to boot
[2:09:57] the economy. It was to boost the
[2:10:00] pocketbook.
[2:10:04] Oh
[2:10:06] my. But how many knows he's not going to
[2:10:10] get to do it? No. Make America great
[2:10:13] again. I hope he
[2:10:15] does. Make it just a little bit better.
[2:10:18] But it's already going south with all
[2:10:21] these judges we got. But I want to make
[2:10:23] a statement. Can I say something?
[2:10:26] I'm not looking for
[2:10:28] Mega. I'm looking for Jesus to make this
[2:10:31] world better
[2:10:34] again. Make the world better again. Give
[2:10:38] us a better world again. And he's going
[2:10:40] to restore it and take it back the way
[2:10:42] that it was supposed to
[2:10:44] be. Hallelujah. How many knows he's
[2:10:48] going to do it? He's going to renovate
[2:10:50] this world.
[2:10:53] Say it with me.
[2:10:58] Amen. He's going to renovate this world.
[2:11:00] All the sin, all the sinners, all the
[2:11:03] sicknesses, all the diseases, high blood
[2:11:06] pressure, cancer,
[2:11:09] tuberculosis, it doesn't matter what it
[2:11:11] is. He's gonna burn it all. And we're
[2:11:14] going to come back here on a new earth,
[2:11:17] a new heaven. How many's looking for
[2:11:19] that? That's real, folks. That's the
[2:11:22] privilege that you and I have of looking
[2:11:25] forward to a new heaven and a new
[2:11:27] earth. Make the world great
[2:11:31] again. Jesus is going to make the world
[2:11:34] great again.
[2:11:37] And it's going to
[2:11:40] be with somebody else.
[2:11:43] trump. The trumpet shall sound. Ain't
[2:11:45] that right? The dead in Christ shall
[2:11:47] rise. We which are alive remain shall be
[2:11:50] caught up together to meet the Lord in
[2:11:52] the air. So shall we ever be with the
[2:11:55] Lord. How many thankful that you are one
[2:11:58] of those privileged people. Don't be
[2:11:59] underprivileged. Accept all that God has
[2:12:01] done for you. Amen. That's right. Rates
[2:12:04] real high. That's right. I want to be a
[2:12:06] privileged
[2:12:07] person. Who was it?
[2:12:12] Dale Potter, brother John probably
[2:12:14] remembers what Dale Potter used to say.
[2:12:16] He says to the UPC, United Pentecostal
[2:12:18] Church, he says UPC stands for
[2:12:20] underprivileged
[2:12:21] children.
[2:12:23] Underprivileged Pentecostals. Yeah. The
[2:12:26] Pentecostals are underprivileged. You
[2:12:27] know why? Because they loved the gift
[2:12:31] more than the giver.
[2:12:35] The Pentecostals love the gift of
[2:12:37] speaking in tongues. That's the
[2:12:39] evidence. If you don't believe that, I
[2:12:41] don't care how much discernment you
[2:12:42] have. I don't care how Jesus comes and
[2:12:45] discern the thoughts and we reject all
[2:12:47] of that. We're hanging on to this gifts
[2:12:50] that we have. Does that make sense? That
[2:12:53] don't make a lick of sense to hang on to
[2:12:56] the gifts and reject the giver.
[2:12:59] We don't reject the gifts or the giver.
[2:13:01] I don't know about you, but I want the
[2:13:03] giver. I want the Holy Ghost. I want
[2:13:05] Christ in my heart. Amen. and all the
[2:13:09] privilege that comes with it. God bless
[2:13:11] you. Let's stand and bow our heads. Lord
[2:13:15] Jesus, we come before you
[2:13:18] humbly reing into joy. Father, that you
[2:13:22] have given your children, even your
[2:13:24] prophet said you want your children
[2:13:25] happy. Just as parents want their
[2:13:28] children happy, you want your children
[2:13:30] happy. Then your prophet taught us we
[2:13:32] ought to be the happiest because we're
[2:13:35] not following some cunningly devised
[2:13:37] fable. We're not following Thomas Ber or
[2:13:39] any other message
[2:13:41] preacher. We're following the message
[2:13:43] they bring to us and that is Jesus
[2:13:46] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[2:13:48] forever. We're following the vindicated
[2:13:50] word of God
[2:13:52] proven. We don't have to wonder, well,
[2:13:56] is this right? Is that right? You came
[2:13:57] and you proved what's right. We've been
[2:14:00] taught to stay with the Bible, stay with
[2:14:03] what the prophet said. And we want to
[2:14:05] thank you, Lord Jesus, for the benefits
[2:14:07] that you give us on Calvary. No wonder,
[2:14:11] Lord, that you said, "Do this in
[2:14:14] remembrance of me." how we want to bow
[2:14:18] our heads, how we want to bring uh honor
[2:14:21] and respect to all of those hundreds of
[2:14:25] thousands more than what we can imagine
[2:14:28] died more brutally than we can imagine
[2:14:31] in the seas, in the
[2:14:33] oceans, Pearl Harbor, and all these
[2:14:35] places where they're buried in ships
[2:14:38] where they gave their lives so that we
[2:14:41] could be free. We would remember all
[2:14:43] those people.
[2:14:45] God bless their
[2:14:47] souls. But Lord, we would think about
[2:14:51] you, Father, of how hard it was for you
[2:14:55] being completely forsaken by
[2:14:57] man. All of
[2:14:59] humanity. There was nobody stood with
[2:15:03] you. But yet you
[2:15:06] came, you sacrificed, you gave your
[2:15:08] life. It was hard, but you gave it
[2:15:13] freely.
[2:15:15] You purchased it our salvation on
[2:15:18] Calvary Street and you said just do in
[2:15:21] remembrance of me. Father, we remember
[2:15:23] what you did so that we could have all
[2:15:27] the benefits, so that we could have all
[2:15:29] that we have and the freedoms that we
[2:15:31] have. And today, this morning, we
[2:15:35] remember you, Lord, for we realize that
[2:15:38] we would not be here. I would not be
[2:15:40] standing. We would not be sitting here.
[2:15:43] This church would not exist. We'd be
[2:15:46] scattered out there
[2:15:47] somewhere under a curse somewhere if you
[2:15:51] wouldn't have sent Malachi 4 and come
[2:15:53] down the way that you did and proved
[2:15:55] yourself alive and real. And I pray this
[2:15:58] morning that each and every one of your
[2:16:00] children this morning would possess the
[2:16:03] Holy Spirit. They would possess you,
[2:16:05] Father, in their
[2:16:08] hearts. that peace that comes with you,
[2:16:12] that joy that comes with you. And Lord,
[2:16:16] if there's any in here that hasn't
[2:16:18] accepted you, haven't committed their
[2:16:19] life to you this morning, may they raise
[2:16:21] their hands now and say, "God, I want to
[2:16:23] accept you in the name of Jesus Christ."
[2:16:26] God bless those hands. God bless those
[2:16:27] hands. God bless you, Lord Jesus. Bless
[2:16:30] every hand that's up, Lord. They receive
[2:16:33] you, Father. Lord, they want to be a
[2:16:35] beneficiary of what you have done for
[2:16:37] it, Lord, so that they can be privileged
[2:16:39] to be able to escape the wrath that is
[2:16:41] to come. They can be privileged to walk
[2:16:43] the life that they now have with you,
[2:16:46] Lord Jesus, in peace, forgiven of their
[2:16:50] sins, washed in the blood of Jesus
[2:16:52] Christ. Father, I ask this morning,
[2:16:55] Lord, you take this little message that
[2:16:56] I feel you've laid upon our hearts and
[2:16:58] help us all to appreciate the sunsets.
[2:17:01] Appreciate God every breath that you
[2:17:03] give
[2:17:04] us. Appreciate every benefit that you
[2:17:07] have given us
[2:17:08] Lord and not be
[2:17:11] negligent but to remember the gospel
[2:17:14] that was preached to us and not be
[2:17:17] slothful Lord Jesus but to be
[2:17:20] perseverant in serving you. Make us more
[2:17:23] like you and draw us closer now in Jesus
[2:17:25] name. Amen and amen. God bless you
[2:17:27] church. God bless you
[2:17:32] brother. For you are
[2:17:35] great. You do
[2:17:38] miracles so
[2:17:41] great. There is no one else like
[2:17:46] [Music]
[2:17:48] you. There is no one else like you. For
[2:17:55] you are
[2:17:57] great. You do
[2:18:00] miracles so
[2:18:03] great. There is no one else like
[2:18:10] you. There is
[2:18:13] no one else like you.
[2:18:21] For you deserve the
[2:18:23] [Music]
[2:18:26] glory and the
[2:18:29] [Music]
[2:18:31] honor. Lord, we lift our hands in
[2:18:37] worship as we praise your holy name.
[2:18:43] You deserve the
[2:18:48] glory and the
[2:18:53] honor. Lord, we lift our hands in
[2:18:59] worship as we praise your holy name.
[2:19:04] You are
[2:19:06] great and you do
[2:19:09] miracles so
[2:19:12] great and there is no one else like
[2:19:19] you. Lord, there is no one else like
[2:19:24] you. For you are
[2:19:28] great. You do
[2:19:31] miracles so
[2:19:33] great. There is no one else like
[2:19:40] you, Lord. There is no one else like
[2:19:48] you. You are great. Oh, you are great.
[2:19:55] You do
[2:19:57] miracles so
[2:20:00] great. There is no one else like
[2:20:07] you. There is no one else like you. For
[2:20:13] you are
[2:20:16] great. You do
[2:20:19] miracles so great.
[2:20:22] There is no one else like
[2:20:26] [Music]
[2:20:28] you. There is no one else like
[2:20:38] you. And my hope is in the Lord from
[2:20:41] this time on.
[2:20:43] My
[2:20:46] hope is in the
[2:20:50] Lord from this time
[2:20:54] on and ever more.
[2:21:00] Oh my
[2:21:03] hope is in the
[2:21:08] Lord
[2:21:10] forever
[2:21:12] more. One more time. My hope, oh
[2:21:18] my
[2:21:21] hope is in the
[2:21:26] Lord. From this time
[2:21:30] on and ever
[2:21:34] more,
[2:21:35] all my
[2:21:39] hope is in the
[2:21:44] Lord forever more.
[2:21:53] I stand in awe within the presence of
[2:21:59] the
[2:22:01] Lord. In whom the wisdom of the
[2:22:07] anges
[2:22:10] lies. For whom the raing of the
[2:22:15] sea
[2:22:18] subides, the livinging
[2:22:21] [Music]
[2:22:23] sacrifice, the only
[2:22:26] source of
[2:22:28] life, my
[2:22:31] hope, give in the
[2:22:36] Lord from this time
[2:22:40] on and ever
[2:22:44] more.
[2:22:45] All my
[2:22:48] hope is in the
[2:22:53] Lord
[2:22:55] forever
[2:23:01] more. And his tender mercies come with
[2:23:06] every
[2:23:07] rising
[2:23:10] sun. To meet the sinner in his
[2:23:15] [Music]
[2:23:18] brokenness. To offer healing and
[2:23:22] forgiveness.
[2:23:28] And those who
[2:23:30] trust in him will find their
[2:23:34] hearts at
[2:23:36] rest. My hope, my
[2:23:41] hope is in the
[2:23:44] [Music]
[2:23:46] Lord. From this time on and ever more.

[2:24:30] Lord
[2:24:31] forever
[2:24:36] more. Amen. The same God is living in
[2:24:39] me. The same
[2:24:41] God who spoke
[2:24:44] to the woman
[2:24:47] at the well.
[2:24:50] The same
[2:24:51] God whose
[2:24:54] wonders too
[2:24:56] many to
[2:24:59] tell. The same
[2:25:02] God who
[2:25:04] parted the
[2:25:06] raging Red
[2:25:08] [Applause]
[2:25:11] Sea. Oh, he's the same
[2:25:14] God who's
[2:25:16] living in me. We sing the chorus again.
[2:25:21] Oh, the same
[2:25:23] God who spoke
[2:25:26] to the woman
[2:25:28] at the
[2:25:31] well. The same God whose
[2:25:36] wonders too
[2:25:38] many to tell.
[2:25:42] The same God who
[2:25:45] parted the
[2:25:48] raging red
[2:25:49] [Music]
[2:25:52] sea. Oh, he's the same
[2:25:55] God who's
[2:25:57] living in me.
[2:26:03] And I look
[2:26:05] back on
[2:26:07] history, see the mighty God
[2:26:12] unveil. He's
[2:26:14] proving over and
[2:26:17] over. That his word can never
[2:26:22] fail. But I can keep on
[2:26:26] dwelling on some past
[2:26:29] meories.
[2:26:33] Cuz he's the same
[2:26:36] God who's living in
[2:26:41] me.
[2:26:43] Oh, the same
[2:26:45] God who spoke
[2:26:48] to the woman
[2:26:50] at the well.
[2:26:54] The same God whose
[2:26:57] wonders too
[2:26:59] many to
[2:27:02] tell. The same God who
[2:27:07] parted the
[2:27:09] raging red
[2:27:13] sea. Oh, he's the same
[2:27:17] God who's living in me.
[2:27:24] And it's the same God who
[2:27:28] created all the heaven and all the
[2:27:33] earth who came back living in
[2:27:38] Jesus. There was
[2:27:40] power in his
[2:27:43] word. But now in these last days, I'm
[2:27:49] beginning to
[2:27:53] see. Oh, that it's the same
[2:27:57] God who's living in me.
[2:28:04] Oh, the same
[2:28:06] God who spoke
[2:28:09] to the woman
[2:28:11] at the
[2:28:13] well. The same God whose
[2:28:18] wonders too
[2:28:20] many to tell.
[2:28:24] The same God who
[2:28:28] parted the
[2:28:30] raging red
[2:28:34] sea. Oh, he's the same
[2:28:37] God who's living in
[2:28:42] [Music]
[2:28:44] me. Amen. What a revelation this
[2:28:47] morning. Amen. It's been good to be in
[2:28:49] the house of the Lord. Amen. Let's sing
[2:28:51] that song before we go. My God is real.
[2:28:54] He's real in my
[2:28:55] soul. There are some
[2:29:00] things I may not
[2:29:04] know. There are some
[2:29:08] places
[2:29:09] I can't go.
[2:29:14] But I am
[2:29:17] sure of this one
[2:29:21] thing. My God is real. For I can feel
[2:29:26] him in my
[2:29:29] soul. My God is
[2:29:33] real. He's real in my
[2:29:37] soul. My God is real. For he has washed
[2:29:43] and made me
[2:29:46] whole. And his love for
[2:29:48] [Music]
[2:29:50] me is like your
[2:29:54] gold. And my God is real. For I can feel
[2:29:59] him in my
[2:30:02] soul. And some folk may doubt.
[2:30:07] Some folk may
[2:30:10] scorn. All can go on and leave me
[2:30:19] alone. But as for
[2:30:23] me, I'll take God's
[2:30:27] part. And God is real. For I can feel
[2:30:32] him in my
[2:30:34] soul. And my God is
[2:30:38] real. He's real in my
[2:30:42] soul. My God is real. For he has washed
[2:30:48] and made me
[2:30:51] whole. His love for
[2:30:55] me is like pure
[2:30:59] gold. And my God is real. For I can feel
[2:31:04] him in my
[2:31:07] soul and I cannot
[2:31:11] tell just how it
[2:31:15] felt when Jesus took my
[2:31:20] sins away.
[2:31:24] But since that
[2:31:27] day, yes, since that
[2:31:31] hour, God has been real. For I can feel
[2:31:36] his holy
[2:31:38] power. And my God is
[2:31:42] real. He's real in my
[2:31:46] soul. My God is real. For he has washed
[2:31:52] and made me
[2:31:54] whole. His love for
[2:31:58] me is like pure
[2:32:02] gold. My God is real. For I can feel him
[2:32:08] in my soul. Sing it again as you're
[2:32:11] dismissed. My God is
[2:32:14] real. He's real in my soul.
