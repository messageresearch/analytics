Lord to be in your house assembled together Lord Jesus with your children that are filled with your licks of fire so to speak father and we've come Lord for one purpose and that's to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord and to hear what you have to say to us tonight father Lord Jesus we're so grateful God that you're still speaking to your people Lord Jesus and I believe that you'll do it all the way to the end God we just pray father that you'd help us to speak in a timely fashion Lord that the word that is spoken that it would be in time and season we believe God that you'll say just what you once said Lord Jesus bless the meditation of our heart the reading of the word Lord and that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to minister tonight God we just ask God that you just bless it now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen praise the Lord if you will I think we will turn to Genesis let's just turn to Genesis 1 amen I woke up this morning and this is what came to my mind and amen it just be to pour out and I said well Lord if that's what we don't me to speak on that's what was speak on amen amen I kind of feel like it's uh you know what something that Peter had said he says you know uh I want to come and he says stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance amen you know it's not about maybe preaching something new or different but amen sometimes we know need our Pure mind steered up amen so Genesis 1 and we'll begin with the first two verses in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness may God blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen I really wanted to uh uh have basically a lot more that ready than what I did but this is about kind of as far as amen I studied so we'll go as far as we can just see how far the Lord will take us amen and it I don't know if we'll speak on this Sunday again or not but it's certainly something that you could for several Services amen and my title tonight is an or actually in in in It's actually an imp I put under there I called it an overview of a Christian but it's an indepth look at a Christian amen praise the Lord and there's one quote that I basically started out with that my mind came my mind came to and so it's something brother Bram had said uh but I'm going to read the quote before Amen to try to get us a picture of basically you know what he was thinking about where he was going basically before he makes this statement amen so he says now we see what a bundle that we've got talking about the world and its condition he say the whole world has become a conglomeration of Muk and you can imagine this back in the six is that right he said it's Allen and he says and it's got to get that way to blow up amen got to get that way to blow up and then he goes into talking about things that we've pulled out all the all the gases and the oils out the Earth took all the steel out and it's barely hanging by a thread to where he makes a sound amen as far as we've taken and and and what we've done with the Earth then he comes back to the people and then there one Great Big M till it just like it was at the beginning it grieved God that he ever made man amen amen that's you know you talk about God having feelings how many believe God has feelings I believe if I remember right brother Bandon one time was ministering ring and he he did the a the sign of the Messiah and so forth and made an altar call and just about three people or something like that would come up you know and he says you know that really hurt him you know after he would do that and then nobody responds I don't know about you I'd like to been in one of them servants wouldn't you have Amen to know that that was Jesus Christ amen the resurrected Jesus Christ right there doing the same things he did and hadn't really done it for 2,000 years amen not on that level anyway but anyway so it grieved God that he ever made man he says and it just takes one little Atomic jar to set the whole thing out of order there just exactly what he said that he would do see amen and I thought I might read that scripture before I read the quote that I want to start with amen um and I'll just once again it's very familiar scriptures and basically what the the Bible talks of what's going to happen he says but the day of the Lord second Peter 4 I believe it is or three and verse 10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night into which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and The Works uh the works that are therein shall be burnt up amen so we know that Heavens is going to be on fire the Earth is going to be on fire amen and all the works that are therein shall be burnt up amen now I I just try to imagine because I don't think anybody I really don't think anybody uh is capable of imagining what's going to happen if I was going to try to imagine it because the Bible says the heavens are going to be dissolved they're going to be on fire they're going to burn they're going to pass away the Bible says right there heaven will pass away the Earth will pass away in other words die or change from one form to another right and just imagine and I don't know the gases whatever is out there uh he talks about one to set it off and blow it up and perhaps an atomic chain a fire but in so hot I mean the heavens is going to be so hot and I would believe that it's going to be Universal that mean it's going to be on the other side of the Earth the whole ball everything's going to be under Fire it's all all going to burn with extreme heat extreme heat it's all going to be burnt up germs and they'll wear masks over in heaven hello all of the germs will be burnt up isn't that right amen and now and then Paul then Peter says seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness you know one of the things I want to to say talk what what that encumbers what a Christian encumbers now we realize that when you speak that I can of course go from Genesis to Revelations and we could take an numerable amount of subjects and I've got different subject that I want to perhaps touch on but when we talk about that one of the first things that came to my mind was that is that it's first of all a real Christian is a pilgrim and a stranger here amen how many blows we're just pilgrims and strangers here we're seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God we're looking for a new heavens and a new Earth where we won't never have crookedness no corrupt no lying and all of that that'll all be gone how's looking for a place where righteousness dwells where life dwells where happiness dwells where Joy dwells where Perfection dwell that's what I'm looking for that's what a Christian is looking for amen amen so he says if we're looking for that we realize we seeing that all these things and what kind of people basically what kind of people ought we to be looking for the Hasting of the coming of the day of God where in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fent heat everything that's going to be be hot boy the world needs to realize this don't they nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him oh I love this in peace amen not war not stress not Strife not worry not fear fear not right amen none of those things belong to a Christian amen that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless woo Peter you're making a big demand here a't that right without spot and blameless in other words he can't put a finger on you amen how many know that's something you have to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling nobody can make you righteous and holy that's something you got to find between you and God Amen on your prayer bones so to speak is where you make sure that the blood of Jesus Christ is there because that's the only way you'll ever be blameless is if the Holy Spirit has Sanctified and washed you and filled your heart amen amen praise the Lord amen all right because that has a little bit to do because I want to back up because I'll tell you amen when I think about this even coming out amen after all these other things that was here I said I had done forgot half of the stuff at first that I wanted to say I said man you know you're just going to need God to be able to get it keep it all together amen but what I was trying to say is we go back I want to read that in Genesis again because the Earth was what void isn't that right amen and just like your heart not my heart without God there's a big void right there isn't it amen we'll talk about that in a minute let's go to where amen the initial scripture or the quotes that that uh that I wanted to read now I want to say this before I say that and that is amen that you might say well brother B you read a lot of quotes I wanted to say this ver I want to say you know I might sound like a parrot sometimes times you know like a parent well just he says something so you say something can read this and it's all good we know it's absolutely truth amen my words might fail but this word will never fail amen so I really like the first of all to say speak this and then in the prophet's messages he says if I've told you the truth if he don't come and back it up you ain't got to believe the word I said right amen so if the prophet if Jesus Christ came and Vindicated what he said well I've got a lot of confidence in what he said so if I just say what he said because didn't brother B say he says now just say what's on them tape don't put your own interpretation don't try to figure it out just say what's on them tapes and say Amen stay with that tape teaching in other words if you can't back it up with that amen then then just stay away from it but you got to want to say what he said so I've Got Confidence that when I'm saying what he said I'm saying the right thing how many believes that so if I speak that a little bit don't be offended I just like to do that because if I say something in myself well I may say well you didn't really need to come to church you could just do something different right I might say something that would be off but when I say what he said hello and that's what I want to say not think my own self but only what he said only what the scripture says how many believes that now notice the next quote that I was talking about he says the whole thing's out of cater of God was griefed and so forth so we are just living in that day and happy to be a Christian amen an overview of a Christian first of all how many believe that a Christian oh my has happiness the only real person real people that are in the world that actually have a little happiness about him go to Walmart go to Walmart and sit out there while you're picking up your groceries and waiting sitting there in the car look at the people going by and see how many is Happy look happy no not very many look happy do they no so oh my what could I do he says I believe brother says I believe that i' go wild if I wasn't a Christian looking at the thing look at how many knows it it could just burn up any time scares me of people that backslide you know knowing the message and knowing have maybe hav't been raised in the message and people backslide and you know it's fixing the burn it's fixing all come to an end and you're just comfortable in your Zone oh no no no no not if you have God in you you realize that this thing's coming to an end amen you'll have to give an account on the day of judgment but the B says he'd go wild if I wasn't looking at it he says I don't see how people can stand it I just just don't understand how a man can walk on Earth today without being a Christian hey I'll say Amen to that I don't know about you but how many can say that a amen without being a Christian I tell you what it's so good how manyan it's good to be a Christian things get how bad it look it's still better to be a Christian cuz however bad it is God he going to take you through you'll come out on the other side because you got the one to Hung the Stars taking care of you oh hallelujah amen I like that that this is where I kind of begin I just don't understand without being a I wish anybody would give me a reason some reason why you would not why you would not serve Christ you can't give a sensible [Music] reason well there's more fun Living For The Devil no there ain't cuz I live for him I live for him as crazy as anybody now I'm here to tell you it's not worth it you can have all of those Pleasures but I'm here to tell you after all those Pleasures the inside of you is completely empty you're just a hollow shell that's why they got to have another tattoo that's why they got to make their their hair pink or orange and crazy stuff huh why because you're never satisfied you can't drink the devil's drinking ever get satisfaction amen that's right even their own songs say they can't get no satisfaction don't they that's right they can't but I'm here to tell you I can be satisfied how many satisfied how many eat this bread and are satisfied how many drinks this drink and it crunches your thirst M it was never meant for me to have my top button on Amen praise God aren't you glad that's what we come tonight to drink a little more that's one of the things I want to got on here today Christian has a thirst how many believe that a Christian has a thirst for righteousness they love to come to church they love when the when not the devil when the preacher preaches on their toes and Steeps on them why because they have a thirst to be righteous to be right with God and if you got that thirst you are one blessed person blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled we've got an appetite for the things that are of God cuz why amen the closer you get to God the more you get of God the more you want the more happy you get until after you you end up running around the tree end up putting your m in the park and jumpping up and down and screaming just depends on where your mind is amen praise the Lord so we're happy to be a Christian I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't a Christian amen you can't give a sensible reason I don't know why I want to stop there but I'm gonna that all right if we're on this for two month but I want to stop there for just decid wasn't even thinking about it before but came to my mind a sensible reason you talk about going to hell and burning the Amish they believe you're going to burn for eternity that don't scare aiver out of you I don't know what does that's enough to make anybody do what the bishop says Woody if you believe you're going to burn for Eternity for whatever it takes man I'll do whatever whatever I got to do I don't want to burn for eternity huh right I mean never stop I mean never ever ever ever ever stop burning that's scary ain't it yeah enough to keep them Amish Amish if you go English you going to burn you going go to hell that's right you going Burn For Eternity amen but think about it sure unless you understand and know the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ you're going burn you're gonna burn in hell there's a literal Lake of Fire there's a judgment day you'll stand before the great judge and you'll be judged judge for everything wrong that you ever did from the start from the to the Finish huh you can't imagine it I can't imagine it to have to answer from the day about oh I don't know when you come to the age of accountability and when when you started stealing them cookies and Mama asked did you take a cookie no I didn't take that cookie crumbs were all over you huh all the way to your last breath at 85 90 years old everything you ever did every wrong thought that you ever thought wrong was wrong not one little sin will escape the day is coming when all things will be manifest everything will be made open all the secrets of men's Hearts will be made manifest there's no fooling God I fool everybody else but you're not going to fool God it's recorded that right amen man to think that you ain't got to go there you don't have to go there the penalty of sin was death you you was going to die for your sins for the sins that you have committed you deserve death and the punishment was death he's going to have to die and go to hell and be judged huh Give Me A Reason give me a reason why you wouldn't want to be a Christian but there's a man that came his name was Jesus and he went to Calvary and he paid for your sins he paid for the sins of the whole world he paid for everybody's sins all the way from Cain you know he paid for Cain's sin but he just didn't accept it he died for the sins of the whole world for every sin that was ever committed from the first all the way to the last for every person living on the face of the Earth or any generation died for every last one of them he took the Judgment he took the wrath of God he went to hell for you he died for you he paid the price for you you didn't even have to do anything now give me a reason huh why you wouldn't want to be a Christian amen there's no excuse I mean that's when you get over there oh people are going to have excuses and they're going to have no they're not God's going to take their excuses right away from them anybody that ever heard John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for he came not to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved if they know that but it wasn't for for me it was I don't believe that he meant it for me the word said whosoever will huh whosoever he didn't say Jews Gentiles Russians Chinese or any other group whosoever anybody he left it wide open left the contract wide open anybody that wants to come on let him that's a thirst come and drink of the Water of Life freely you had to ride over your conscience every time you did wrong you had to ride over them I know I shouldn't do this but I'm going to do it anyway that he'll bring that up he put the conscience in you if you ever go to hell how many knows if you go to hell you'll have to jump over every one of his blockades all of his tire strips all of his uh barricades and everything else he put everything in there to stop you from going to hell and you got to jump every last one of them if you're ever going to make it there amen my Give Me A Reason there ain't no reason not to be a Christian that's right simply because people don't want to huh they say well I don't want to accept that Mercy I don't want that kind of Mercy people that don't accept that kind of Grace whatever form or fashion you want to put it whatever excuse or whatever they might say about it you're saying that you don't want that Mercy you will pass on this Mercy when you don't accept it you're saying I will pass on that type of Grace you don't have to go to hell you don't have to burn you can live throughout the ceaseless ages truly live eternally but in perfect blood beyond your imagination of what heaven's going to be like amen and you want to pass on that you have to either pass on it or you have to accept it one or the other I'm glad I accept it aren't you you way amen I accept what you did this accept or believe it he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned how many you reckon how many times Jesus is going to pull that quote up because you know we we know that the Bible is what God's going to use to judge the World by so he'll use those scriptures you heard the scriptures you knew what it said he that believeth in baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them they believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall they take up serpents or anything like that and so forth amen they still lay hands on the sick and they shall recover oh and you didn't believe in Healing The Sick and and casting out devils and all of that but I put it in there that's why brother says man people that claim to be a Christian and then don't believe the word of God their life is not worthy of the Gospel amen if we get that far we want to talk about A Life That's not worthy of the Gospel A Life That's worthy of the Gospel or what we might call worthy to be a Christian worthy to call yourself a Christian amen I want to jump up on this thing I'll control my emotions but when I think about what he done and what he gave me what it is to be a Christian well it just makes me act a little crazy Overjoyed amen amen if I get to it we want to speak about keeping your emotions in check keeping your emotions in check amen but now I thought I said you know the emotions that you have for the Lord and for his goodness if you get a little emotional that'd be all right but you would be amazed what I will show you an example of sometimes we let things dismay us and so forth amen all right I'm get aheading myself praise the Lord can't give a sensible reason Oh my he said this is the day that we ought to be happy and ready the great homecoming time is that H if he could say that back in the 60s what about today how many believe the homecoming is right around the corner could happen before morning we're just about ready to go home aen how many believe that if you truly believe that it will adjust your life if you really believe we're fixing to go home you will adjust anything that needs adjusted because Jesus said many he times he talked about he's going to come and a thief in a night and two will be left and one one will be taken the other one left and so forth but he said but be ready for you know not the day nor the hour part of the seven sealed mystery is a great mystery of not knowing when he's coming we don't know when he's coming that's the surprise oh my didn't mean to go here but when he actually comes when he takes his little bride home amen amen praise the lord we ought to be happy praise the Lord amen all right let's start let's go back to Genesis again Genesis God created the heavens and the Earth the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep but the spirit of the Lord spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and I've always thought that this is a good parallel of a person that's a God is shine in their hearts and their lives and the void that you have amen we know uh uh what was it um you know at one point he talks about God divided the light from the darkness how much I believe it is in the rising of the sun brother bam said he talked about how that God is separating the light from the darkness is that right that was in this day this is a day that is gross Darkness upon the Earth and God is separating the darkness from the light other words he's bringing his children into the light because it's really a great light oh my here we go think about it this is the the what you're believing right there the pillar of fire what God did in this generation Malachi 4 brought the greatest light since the time of Christ we had Dark Ages when it was almost left out but this is the greatest light what was that that light the sign of the Messiah when that woman said you know we what he did through brother bam is that right amen deser her thoughts intense of the heart something that hadn't been done for a long long long time we know that that was the Messiah without a question the truth is here that truth is Vindicated that's the light of the hour right in the middle of the darkest place that there is the world is certainly in Gross Darkness ain't it the not non-Christian is in Gross Darkness oh my Clinton came out with don't tell don't ask don't tell not homosexual look where they've went into not even know what a male and a female free in court to ask her what's a man and a woman really tell her whatever she couldn't even tell you what a man and a woman is that's gross darkness in the brain better one thought had a good one but I found a better one I don't know how I said that but anyway we want to go to I believe it is in let me see if that's where it is Corinthians I believe it is Corinthians 2 Corinthians 4 2 Corinthians 4 can we take our time all right first we want to and we'll talk about the create first of God created the heavens and the Earth and he created a light to shine in the darkness he separated the light from the darkness in verse chapter 4 therefore seeing that we have this ministry chapter 4 of 2 Corinthians we have uh as we have received Mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in dis if our God be hid gospel be hid it is to them that are lost in whom the God of this world ha blinded the minds of them which believe not least the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine upon them amen how many know that was scribes and Pharisees they believe not and the devil blinded their eyes they could not see that he was a Christ hello or CUA how many knows that if that light ever shines down in that seed it quickens the seed like it did with the woman at the well she had representation when that light shined on her it quickened her to the word amen but on them the light don't go down because of unbelief how many know that's what the world's problem is and if there's anything you're not receiving from God remember the only thing that's keeping you away from the promises and the blessings of God is unbelief no matter what it is amen unbelief now notice or that light of God of Christ which the image upon and ourselves your servant for Christ Jesus sake now here's where he types it in with even Paul brings it in with Genesis 1 for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness amen amen has shined in our hearts to give the light of the GL uh the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ hallelujah how many glad that that light shine in your heart that little void the Earth without full mine when I think about what I was as a sinner I was not much to brag about Bo girls brothers sisters that had no anchor do whatever I felt like whatever crazy things somebody would do want to do or whatever it might be or you know just no anchor at all and not much of a man brother Brad not much of a man when I think when God shine his light then we begin to get structure when that seed was quickened you come to life and how many knows if you're ever going to be a Christian that seed has to come and be quickened the light has to shine down there and then all Child of Light amen praise be to God and that void isn't there anymore did you hear that that's the sound of no void in the heart can I hear some sound is there any out there that doesn't have any void it's filled it's F that's right it's fil I'll take your word for it no not really that's mean I hear you that's the truth a it that that void is filled with the baptism of the Holy ghost amen and what beautiful beautiful sunshine now how many knows what the True Light of the believer is it's Jesus Christen because at the second rising of the Sun that the P talked about when Jesus rose from the dead he was going to bring light and the light of the Gospel was going to bring all the Sons and Daughters of God Amen he's going to quick that seed out of the gross Darkness that's out there and there must still be some out there brother John must still be some seed out there that needs Quicken because when that last seed gets quickened how many knows we're going home it's going home time and we're looking for that last seat we don't know who it'll be but when that last seat comes in folks oh my all the ages how many believes all of Abraham all the Old Testament everybody from from abble up is waiting on you and I they're waiting for us to finish this I don't know about you but that should just really make us excited say Lord finish it and we want to go home amen praise the Lord now notice the light shine out of darkness is shined in our hearts and then now notice he says but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God not of us amen praise the Lord maybe we'll come back to verse eight and on down a little bit further on but I want to go and we want to talk to uh talk about kind of person has a right to call himself a Christian y want to find out what kind of person has a right to call himself a Christian brother B says now let me stop here this afternoon and say this that each one of you people that's been borned again of the Holy Spirit you remember the very hour where the Holy Spirit the very spot where he met you when doubts come when fears are begin to rise there's always that certain place that you can come back to God and the devil can't tread on those sacred sins it's where you met God and you talk to him though fears and things rise it has nothing to do with it you know you met God on those sacred Sands amen friend no matter what you've done if you still haven't got that real trust and faith in God that real something that's real in your heart that you know that you met God on them sacred s where you can go right back there on the back side of the desert like Moses did and meet him there and put your finger on that place where it happened it won't work if you think you've been there and you still care for in there your life proves it another one no man has a right to take the pulpit to preach the gospel unless he has had a backside of the desert experience how many know says you know you can't you know the it has to be you have got to have a revelation of Jesus Christ he said I believe it's Jesus said you know who who is the son of man and so forth and Jesus Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you how many knows a secondhand experience is not worthy of you calling yourself a Christian just because your mom and dad brother sister somebody else just because a preacher amen this side or the other you can't have a secondhand experience God don't have any grandchildren you have there has to be something that happens between you and God I'm going to say this I've met people that and I don't know maybe there's people in here that you just don't know when and how but you just pray about that but I've met people that could not take me to a time and a place let me tell you something things didn't go so well they didn't do so good they didn't do so good at all when it comes to being proving themselves a Christian amen because how many believe that if you're a Christian born a Christian you're gonna be a Christian there's things in this Bible that overrides your feelings your emotions or anything else it overrides it the Holy Ghost will give you the power to conquer like brother B says if you're still loving the world or these other things and you then you uh haven't got it now notice no man has a right to pulpit and preach the gospel unless he's had a backside of the desert experience no man no person has the right to call themselves a Christian a Christian I'm a Christian how many knows the saying the saying is the biggest stumbling buck that the world has ever had is somebody that claims to have a to be a Christian but isn't he's a professor or a how do how does that go he has a confession without having a possession right confesses to be a Christian but but he doesn't possess the quality of it a hypocrite is the biggest stumbling block the world has I'm sure you've heard it so how many believ that we ought to make sure make sure let me say this as your pastor make sure that you're born again make sure young people as you get to the age of accountability that you have an experience with almighty God personal EXP experience can I say a personal walk with God a personal relationship with God just religion ain't going to cut it just being a church member isn't going to cut it you'll never live a Victorious Life the devil will whip you around he'll use you in so many ways you couldn't even begin to imagine I'm a personal witness of it and a person that doesn't really have a possession they will absolutely make Havoc amen wo but anyway that all right thank you no person has the right to call themselves a until Dave had a backside of the desert experience amen he says it's still the back side of the desert what we call an upper room or side of the desert experience amen it's still a backs side of the desert too it's where you met God Amen I like this I've got two of them here we're not going to get very far tonight but that's all right now I want you to get this and don't you ever let this pass from you if ever a man stood on that secred Sands at the backside of the desert when he meets God face to face there's not enough devils in all of hell that can ever take that away from him huh you got a real experience not don't know about you but I can take it to it and I can take you to the place it was in Sarasota Florida down by Philipp Creek that's right the boat ramp right down there I went down there got baptized anden John SE baptize me I come up out of the water they prayed over me and so forth and I was over on the bank kind of by myself over there and I thought I was just gonna float away I was just so oh happy free I knew that my sins were forgiven I know that God had filled me with the Holy Ghost all the bubbling of slow moving philippy Creek brother John and all those bubbles from the baptism was still kind of going down through there I said look at there Philip greens and into the ocean there goes my sins in the sea of God's forgetfulness Glory has the devil ever been taken away from me I'm still here ain't I wasn't me it was him you're still here that's a good testimony that God did a work in you how many's glad for that you don't don't fit you don't dare call yourself Christian unless you have had a real experience with all my God and you met him and he did something for you that no devil can ever take away from you we're going to take the next 10 10 minutes and we want to talk about these Devils he knows he met God he knows that that had experience Oh my he talked to God regardless of what the opposition regardless of what the opposition he can say from that time something changed me amen how many believes you got to have one of those from that time EXP experience Amen brother Braham says now today the Church of the Living God has the privilege of standing and seeing the Conquering resurrected Jesus Christ how many believe that the Son of God Living God standing present living in his church doing the same things that he did again possessing the gates of the enemy amen possessing the gates of the enemy remember the scripture says thy seed now possess the Gate of its enemy if you're born again you're a child of God now notice doing the same thing then we possess the Gate of every enemy if you've got an enemy this morning brother if you are a Seed of Abraham after hearing this that whole message you got to hear it there's not enough devils in hell that can ever keep that gate before you wo Glory I'm going to just preach tonight is that okay I'm telling you if you're a Son of God you become absolutely as Invincible as God is because you become a Son of God you become like Christ and it didn't matter how many Devils jumped onto Jesus he conquered every last one of them I don't know about you but the prophet of God said I see streams and streams and streams of demon powers the lid has come off of H and the streams going this way streams going that way streams going over here they're inhabiting everybody everybody out there oh they're painting them there oh they're inhabiting them folks they're trying to get into church trying to put depression on you trying to put fear on [Music] you but you could pile every devil in hell on top of a Christian all on top of me what am I going to do what am I going to do there ain't enough devils in Hell get out of get out of here get off of me you'll conquer every devil out of hell that's the way I did there ain't enough Devils come on people there ain't enough devils in hell to stop you NOP no no there's not enough Devils that's what he said there's not enough oh my come on people think about that real good you as a Christian there's not enough devils in Hell there's not enough brother John they can't stop you they'll never stop you if you're born again and got the baptism in the Holy Ghost not enough demons Wicked looking hairy little fellas oh my I didn't think it was gonna get me this excited but I'm here to tell you just get emotional when you think about that you get a real experience with God you have become a Christian that's what part of the view part of looking at a Christian not enough streams streams streams the lid come off there's still not enough oh we can serve the devil notice I'm a Son of God now and you ain't got enough reinforcements you ain't got enough imps behind you to stop a son and daughter of God oh brother B's a brother berer did this and brother berer did that don't think the devil hasn't said that oh he has but I don't care go ahead and say devil I can take you to the place the devil can't go he can't take that away from me no I know that wasn't me I know that was him and he that got a good work BR me will perform it he that has begun a good work in you he will perform it he will hold you oh all we got to do is surrender more surrender your ways Surrender Your Life surrender your mind a little bit more a Christian thinks on these things he don't think about the darkness and all of that he thinks about the other amen the light we'll get into that Sunday praise the Lord oh I love that I thought man I like that I I just had me a fit notice reason I picked this up looking for where he it there's not enough devil he went over in possessing the seats of the the gates of the enemy he says no matter what that gate is huh no matter what that gate is the devil puts gate amen like our brother perhaps preach Sunday a wall he can't build a wall big enough you think the walls of Jericho they had so much comfort in and R Jed it wasn't big enough to stop the sons of God Samson he had experience with God didn't he a thousand weren't enough brother John a thousand weren't enough he killed a thousand before they grew a brain I can imagine there was probably 10,000 maybe 20 I don't know how many there was but I can imagine it was a real crowd and after a thousand lay dead heaps upon heaps huh maybe he killed this one this one this one this one this one this one this one this one and they build it up on them they had to crawl up out of there you know get down there and here to come again he had a whole bunch of heaps heaps upon heaps the Bible say finally the captain maybe he was up on top of the hill somewhere okay guys I let enough of you die let's grow a brain here all right stop pull back well you ain't going to get him how many believes he could have been 10,000 could have been 20,000 when God gives you strength how many believe that that's what you and I have we have God's strength the power is of him the Bible says didn't Paul say that the power may be of him and not of us how many knows Moses coming down to Pharaoh the greatest Pharaoh what would it be you can't really go to up to our president nowadays and say well you better bow or whatever nowadays he probably would but you take e and how and everybody else you take some of them guys and you have some they come up here and says now look you better do this that or the other a that right they says don't you realize we're a superpower we just conquered Japan and we just conquered Hitler and everything else we got nukes huh that's kind of how it was with Moses and Pharaoh he was the superpower of the day and Moses goes up to him and says I'm here to tell you God says let my people go huh made a real Warrior out of him because he had a backside of the desert experience he met God and he was there and and that's the prophet he take his wife and his little child on a mule people asking where you going Moses I'm going down to Egypt and we're going to get all the millions of slaves we're going to set them free we're going to down take over huh 75 years old or something I guess well I don't know how Mo old Moses was I don't know but anyway however old he was they have thought like brother Brown says they thought he was a little scile yep yep Sons done got to him the back side of De done drove that man crazy but he wasn't great he knew he had met God when you meet God there's nobody will ever take that away from you nothing can ever take that away from you let me tell you something how many believes that the saving grace of God is is divine it is divine work I can't give it to you only God can do that for you if you got a hunger in your heart for God you just be very thankful there's a inkling the slightest inkling and I believe brother bam here the end I didn't pull that quot down he says how many here would like to have that experience of meeting God on the back side of the desert this is your chance amen meet God on the backside amen looks like brother uh uh Floyd brother remember he always talk about how did he ran to the altar God says that's your last chance that's your last chance how many know we heard him a lot of time preach and he tell he tell it almost every service oh we're going to hear his testimony again we're going to hear his testimony again does not talk bad about it man that's not here right but I liked it why because that's one place that he could go that's where God did something for me and if I don't never say anything else hey if I can't tell nobody else nothing else man I'm not a very good witness what did the prophet of God say that you ought to do just tell them how God lit that's right just tell people how God lit we don't we aren't ashamed of our test we love our testimonies amen shamgar same way he got fed up God come down on the inside folks and it was over with oh can I just say what comes to my mind I don't care what your problem is I don't care what your problem is you let God speak to you about that problem you let God come and deal with you on that problem and it'll be gone but until then you'll just fight it and fight it and fight it and fight iten I wonder sometimes why God lets us fight the things so long maybe so we real realize that hey we can't do it and when you do overcome it it wasn't you it was him that come and he did it Sovereign great is the word I'm looking for Sovereign Grace he had Sovereign Grace upon you how many's glad for that Sovereign divine grace well the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away amen I I me like that well I I'll tell you the world he didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away nothing can take away he gave it to you better nothing else can take it ever away God bless you tonight we'll stop there amen stand musicians if you'll come thank you Jesus how many of just say thank you Lord thank you Jesus amen I can't preach like that he can amen if I get out of the way amen God bless you tonight we love y'all let's bow our heads I want you to think about it what we said about there's not enough devils in hell to stop you from possessing the gate

of my heart because of the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary I can overcome every devil there is there's not enough devils in hell to stop us Lord Jesus I ask God that you would look at

all temptation and the possession of the Church of the Living God tonight is this morning lays the power to change sin and to throw it away and to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Church of Christ whatsoever you desire ask in my name and it shall be given unto you how many believe that a little while in the world don't see me no more but you will see me for I'll be with you how many believes that not just with you but even in you to the end of the world and the works that I do shall you do also amen he shall possess the seat the Gate of the enemy amen no matter what that gate is
