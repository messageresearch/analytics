[0:00] He says, "Here it was." What was it?
[0:03] What was it? He said, "It was
[0:04] enforcing."
[0:06] We said, "Give it back."
[0:10] He said, "That's what we're talking
[0:11] about. Restore it. Bring it back to its
[0:13] rightful owner." Because Satan has
[0:16] robbed you of your privileges.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; He's here to do what? Steal, kill,
[0:24] destroy. We can never forget that. We
[0:27] can never say that enough because that
[0:29] identifies who our who our enemy is. And
[0:32] when we're fighting in this battle, we
[0:34] have to be able to not note and notify
[0:37] Satan. I'm not open for your games.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God. I have the right to
[0:45] enforce. I am a privileged person.
[0:48] Somebody say, I'm privileged.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; You are a privileged son and daughter of
[0:53] God. And we have a right this morning by
[0:56] the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim.
[0:58] Bring it back.
[1:01] He says, "So if you're afflicted, oh
[1:04] brothers and sisters, if you are
[1:05] afflicted, bring it back.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; Bring back my health, bring back my my
[1:12] my my body." If you have a right before
[1:15] God that you can say, "By his stripes,
[1:20] I am healed."
[1:22] Bring it back. Satan, bring it back.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here depressed,
[1:32] tell Satan, "Satan, give it back. Give
[1:34] me back my joy."
[1:36] &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here unhappy, Satan,
[1:38] give me back my happiness.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; I'm sending a summon to you.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Show up in court because I've got the
[1:48] best lawyer on the face of the earth.
[1:52] bring back what you've stole. Give me
[1:54] back my happiness. Restore the joy of my
[1:57] salvation.
[1:59] But we begin to see these things
[2:02] and the prophet tells us when we tell
[2:05] Satan to give it back. We're enforcing.
[2:09] He said it's it's to restore back to its
[2:11] natural condition. Now, I want you to
[2:13] listen to what he says. A man that is
[2:15] sick, a baby is sick, a woman is sick,
[2:18] they're out of their natural condition.
[2:22] God didn't make us to be sick.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; God's original plan was not for us to be
[2:27] sick, to have anxiety, to have fear, to
[2:30] have doubt.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; He didn't intend for any of that to
[2:33] happen.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "But so we have a right to
[2:38] enforce our claim. It's our claim
[2:41] because God gave it to us. By his
[2:42] stripes we're healed. He was wounded for
[2:45] our transgressions. With his stripes
[2:48] we're healed. He said, "Now we have to
[2:49] enforce that law." The lawgiver, the
[2:52] Holy Spirit himself is here, the agent
[2:56] of God to see that it is done.
[3:02] There is no reason for us, brothers and
[3:04] sisters, to go before the Lord in prayer
[3:07] and get a get sign a petition and
[3:09] summons it to the devil and then be
[3:11] afraid to deliver the paperwork.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; How many's got the Holy Ghost?
[3:19] &gt;&gt; What's he there for? The Holy Ghost is
[3:22] there as an agent to see that it's done,
[3:26] that it's a finished work. You say,
[3:29] "Well, you're just trying to pump us
[3:31] up." I'm not trying to pump you up. I'm
[3:33] telling you what the word says. I'm
[3:34] telling you what the prophet says. I'm
[3:36] telling you what the message of the hour
[3:38] restores us, too.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; This is a restoration message.
[3:44] He says, "Now, the only way that he can
[3:46] work, you want to know how to make this
[3:48] work? You want to know how to have your
[3:50] healing? You want to know how to have
[3:52] your deliverance? You want to know how
[3:53] to have your salvation? The only way to
[3:56] make this work is when you let him work.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's not me. It's not me
[4:06] manufacturing. It's not me putting on.
[4:07] It's not me doing this or that. But it
[4:09] is when we allow God to work. And he
[4:12] says, "You got to believe it.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; You got to believe it with all your
[4:16] heart.
