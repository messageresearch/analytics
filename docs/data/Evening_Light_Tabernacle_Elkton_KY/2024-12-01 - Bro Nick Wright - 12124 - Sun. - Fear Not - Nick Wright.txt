God bless you friends very good to see you uh very good to be here finally um as brother berer was mentioning uh we tried to get here a few months ago um my uh my grandmother had some heart issues is what happened um and that's an interesting situation Lord's been dealing with me since I've been about 15 years old and when he started moving on my life uh you know sometimes families kind of distance themselves right so that's kind of what happened uh my grandma and me and um started kind of distancing and so anyway I get this phone call that she's got this heart condition and her heart is uh 25% or less um you know very very serious condition uh so bad that they can't do surgery on her there's too much risk so basically she was in the condition where either she's going to improve or not so we had the opportunity to go speak to her pray with her she was in the hospital at that time and um what ended up happening is her heart started to get better and better and uh and so she was able to receive uh a defibrillator um and she was able to have surgery and things like that um but what's most important and most interesting about that situation is at the end of it she asked me hey can I have one of those Church age books you read and so today we know God can deal with heart conditions physically and he can deal with heart conditions spiritually we've got a lot to be thankful for we had a nice Thanksgiving I I pray everybody had a great Thanksgiving um my wife would have really loved to be here I've got four kids um and we found out that she is expecting another one so she wasn't feeling the best thank you so she wasn't feeling quite up to up to traveling five and a half hours with four kids and being pregnant so um she sends her greetings and us you know she is praying for you all and um and so we just want to go to the Lord in prayer before we open the word we want to go to the author dear Lord gracious Lord we thank you for your mercies on our lives we thank you for just the great testimonies Lord sometimes we look at situations and they seem gleam dull and and we don't know what to make of them but Lord you can take conditions and turn them around Lord in ways we couldn't have even imagined you can you can turn lives around you can heal conditions that are heredity you can heal spiritual conditions Lord Jesus and Lord God I stand here today just a man and and we're here listening to a voice today but God really all that matters is that we hear from you and we get the opportunity to touch you Lord that's all that matters pray Lord God that you use a vessel Lord and and that you just help your body surely there's many needs amongst your children Lord and we just pray Lord God that that their prayers Lord be sent up Lord you just walk in their midst we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace and your mercy thank you for a message Lord that that told us exactly the conditions that we're in Jesus we praise you we thank you and we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen we're going to open up to Revelation 1 verse 17 and we're going to read 17 and 18 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth dead and behold I'm alive Evermore amen and have the keys of hell and death we thank you Lord thank you Lord for the reading of your word we just ask that you bless it Lord if I could take a title tonight it's going to be fear not I want to look at where Jesus said fear not he has the keys of death and hell you may have your seats so Jesus speaking here we know the first chapter is a revelation of who he is when he's speaking to John at Patmos he's showing him who it has been all along amen who has been called Jehovah the almighty God the Everlasting father amen the first and the last the Alpha and the Omega it's Jesus Christ amen and he was saying I have the keys of hell and death and brother brandham said in the key to the door he said any key cannot unlock no door until it's used by a hand it's got to have something to use the key the key in and of itself not use itself it's got to have something to yield brother Brenham said and we can see Jesus 58 so that's the way Divine Healing is it not upon some emotion not upon shaking or something of that type not upon anything but accepting what God promised you and Jesus died that you may have it no one can properly and clearly preach the gospel without preaching Divine Healing you just can't do it for sickness is an attribute of sin and you can't deal with sickness without dealing with sin because sickness came as an attribute of sin before we had any sickness we had no sin but when we got sin sickness followed it you have to deal with both together may I say it like this he said if a big animal had a paw by digging at my side and he was tearing out my ribs the rest of the animal wasn't bothering me but it was just as paw and he said it was tearing his ribs out he said now I don't have to find a knife to cut off his paw just knock him on the head and in my field of profession that's what we call Root calls analysis you go to the root calls you cut off you take his head off that kills the whole animal well that's the way it is with sin when you kill sin you kill every attribute that follows it so it may not be that you've but the weakness of your parents and your parents' parents sickness is heredity in many cases he said and each generation gets weaker and wiser as the scripture says and so therefore you have have to deal with sickness and sin on the same basis of the atonement and in studying The Book of Revelations and seeing the enemy exposed by the power of God we need to understand something Satan has still been successful he's been successful at deceiving and and corrupting the world he's been successful at destroying lives and hiding his true identity within the church amen in the nominal Church World they'll point out that the Roman Catholic Church is the great harlot now think about that how well has Satan really hid himself if the ones pointing out that Satan is in the Catholic church are they themselves called the daughters of the Harlot amen and the Bible said those daughters have blous names so they notice that Satan sits in this great church but they can't notice the deception in their own lives and in their own church but to the believer what we see in the Book of Revelation is more than just an exposure of Satan's deception the beginning of the book shows that is lost amen and that's what we want to focus on Amen and brother Brenham in the fourth seal he's talking about the pale horse rider whose name was called Death he didn't have a name up to that time but when he became the Pale Horse the rider that sat on him was called Death now he's got a name Amen brother brandham in the for se he talked about he talked about how 68 million were put to death for protesting that first Roman Church 68 million died protesting that Roman church now he said no wonder he could imp himself in the name called Death he sure was God only knows how many he calls to spiritually die by his anti-bible word teaching this is the one he put 68 million to the sword and killed and probably literally billions died he said literally billions died on his false teaching no wonder he could take the name of death see the writer in the first place was the anti-christ he was death to begin with then he received a crown he said a Triple Crown one and when he did then he United his church and state because he was over both of them then see if he can unite his State and his church together then the red horse could ride sure enough and that red horse was the second movement after the White Horse and I'm just laying a foundation and the Bible says that after the White Horse the man that sat on him was given a crown then we find that the red horse began to ride and it said he was given a sword and the reason he was given a sword was because he had more power now behind him and that was the power of the church and the authority of the state that he had together amen so he United both forces of phys and spiritual and then brother brenon went on to say again in the for seal he said now he rides in a trinity this horse rides in a trinity a power of a trinity a trinity he's a trinity even though there's four horses there that fourth horse actually all three of them wrapped up into one because these colors are all it's pale in color he said and they're all wrapped up into one red white and black right and brother Brenham said just as three things make a Christian a Son of God there's three powers that make a devil who he is the three things that make you a Son of God is water blood and spirit you can't be a Son of God with just the water and the blood because if you have just the water and the blood but no Spirit there's no life and many of us can accept the washing of the water amen but you've got to go further than that you got to put it under the blood once you put it under the blood don't go back and visit it again and normally I I wouldn't talk about this type of thing uh openly like like this but as I was studying this topic um the Lord dealt with me in in a dream and I hope this is okay to share I was laying to sleep one night and had this dream that this woman came up and laid next to me and she asked me she said tell me about your past and I said no but I can tell you about how the blood of Jesus me and she said said no no no tell me about your path and I said no but I can tell you about how the blood of Jesus covers me she said tell tell me about your your weaknesses I said no but I can tell you about how the blood of Jesus covers me and her Fang started to show and her teeth started to grow and she started clawing at me and hitting me and she said tell me about your sicknesses and I said no but I can tell you about how the blood of Jesus covers me her nails grew and she started digging and choking and I said no but I can tell you about how the blood of Jesus covers me and I woke up and there was a ball of light hanging and I Heard a Voice say fear not and as I went back to sleep I began to realize right before I fell asleep all of what that demon was doing wasn't harming me it was bluffing me it wasn't cutting me really it wasn't choking me I was still breathing it was pounding on me but I didn't feel it there was no harm the devil was a bluff the devil's defeated today and so we want to delve into that there's three powers that make the devil and the powers are politics religion and demonic power amen and Satan unites his forces to better subdue people and and and to keep them imprisoned amen he leverages things in our life through insecurities and sicknesses inherited from from foods and environmental and andary sicknesses and this carries a dual power physical in nature and spiritual in nature it has a physical impact and a spiritual impact I just came forward today and told you a testimony of a physical he healing and a spiritual healing amen when things run in families fear takes root because of who's succumbed before each person who's who's who's fell to that sickness each death is reinforcing the disease disas his grip on a previous generation it's more than just a physical battle amen and and maybe some of you are currently struggling with an Affliction where Satan has put together multiple pieces to maintain his hold through Power and through fear and this fear fear can paralyze fear can paralyze your faith amen but Jesus spoke fear not fear paralyzes a person's faith and takes away their spiritual stamina and sometimes it it could make you almost ready to give up however you should know that Satan is not the one you fear and brother Brenham said and be not afraid there's two elements that control the entire race in the world one of them is fear and the other is Faith now it's either fear or faith controls every nation every denomination every individual you're either fear or faith that controls you amen amen and God testifying of his gifts so don't fear fear is of the devil Everything Jesus would say fear not fear not constantly fear not fear not is that right always fear not God don't want you to fear he wants you to believe so every one of you believe with one Accord one Accord every one the Bible says in 1 John 4 17 to9 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear and love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us when you encounter fear in your life understand this truth it's not from God he never put fear upon you and this means you every right to dismiss the devil completely acknowledge it give it space or spend even a moment considering it you can rightfully fear that surfaces in your life you never asked for it God never sent it and it has no place in a believer's life amen fear was never part of God's divine plan fear comes from the enemy and it's the church job to eliminate the enemy and his devices not to accommodate them amen look at scripture fear was absent until sin came in in Genesis there was perfect harmony no fear between Adam and the animals no fear of God no fear at all until the fall it was only when Adam and Eve sinned that fear emerged Ed when God found Adam hiding behind the Fig leaes Adam confessed that he was afraid this was fears first appearance and it was born from snation and that's why Paul would tell the church in Romans 8 that for those who are in Christ who walk after and not the flesh condemnation is gone amen so what he's presenting is life without fear replaced by faith a life where belief simply rules in your heart now think about this only a demonic Force trying to steal your true Christian experience which is rest amen but we're resting today in knowing God is God and we're his children and everything he's promised he's either doing or has done so what's Left to Fear our theme song is only believe amen yes amen amen amen Satan is not the one who we should stand in fear of today but we should stand in fear of a holy God and this fear is reverence of his words this fear is respect this this fear is love for when his Spirit begins to move you ought to not just look at it and say well that's just for them no you ought to say God if I'm missing something give it to me because I I fear your presence amen and Satan's first deception as we just talked about was through a serpent the Beauty and the smartness of the serpent coupled with Satan's craftiness was a combination Eve couldn't resist he used what you could see and he used what you could hear and he took the word of God and presented it to her but he coupled it with beauty and craftiness and she couldn't overcome it amen so Satan's very power uses lies and symptoms and family history and if you would look down history of the scriptures you would see how much Satan uses these types of alliances to come against God's people and Satan of death over man and the questions of immorality and what happens beyond the grave man could not see past that veil of Darkness but if you would just read the story of job and look at him he's looking over his whole whole life and he's questioning why am I here you know why because everything had been took it wasn't just one thing it was a combination one right after the other he lost everything Satan's combination was not only to take his business and his livelihood he took his children all of his children died then after his children he lost his his farm his goods and then his wife turned to him and said you might as well Curse God and die his relationships failed God allowed every relationship he was in to try and question his faith in God and on top of everything else he lost his health what do you think his spiritual condition was like that day my God and it made him question why he was even born and he's kneeling there on that Ash sheep and his wife bends down and she begins to whisper in his ear curse him and he's kneeling there on that as sheep and his wife bends she bends down and says that and you know what job did he said you speak like a foolish woman fell down and he worshiped God Amen now he did not understand what he was going through he didn't understand why he was going through it but he knew he had to worship God no matter what and I want you to know you Al may not going through pain may be so great that you don't know how to fight it and you may be so weary that it's hard for you to stand but I want you to know this don't ever give up you always worship God for that's the greatest Victory I said that's the greatest victory in God's eyes not so much the Divine Healing but a man that could sit there and lose everything and said I still Worship You Lord I'll never give up on you I'll never turn back I'm part of this and I don't care how many disappointments come I don't care if I lose my business I don't I lose it all I'll not lose my God hallelujah hallelujah look at job's trouble and I'll just read down through scures in job 10:20 uh to 22 are not my days few cease then he said and let me alone that I may take comfort a little before I go when I shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death amen a land of Darkness as Darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is in darkness in Job 14 he says for there is hope of a tree it can be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will Bud oh I love that to think of that I've the tree I've watched it withered down to nothing till it's dead all the way down to the ground yet at the scent of water for the water is being poured out and you may also be dead all the way to the ground but at the scent of water it will sprout again that tender Branch will not cease maybe today you've got spiritual Amnesia maybe you forgot who you were you thought maybe I'm not even part of this thing anymore but I want you to know you may be dead all the way to the ground but the scent of water is in in your nostrils just now it jogs your memory amen and it causes you to live for him like you did before and I want you to know you're going to sprout again and you're going to live for him again why because you were planted by God not by man amen Isaiah 61 says these are the plannings of the Lord that he might be glorified if you're sitting here today and are under the grips of Satan and don't know how to break free I want you to know amen he said fear not I am he that was alive and was dead and liveth again I took the keys of death and Hell Satan does not have the keys Satan cannot take you anywhere unless God first unlocks the door he can't take you anywhere unless God first unlocks the door and allows him to do it amen which means Satan is only serving God's purpose there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again the tender Branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground and yet through the scent of water it will bud and will bring forth bows like a plant can you imagine today living completely without fear what would it truly mean to live Fearless that would be perfect faith and as God's Prophet said give me someone who's walking in faith living in faith he said that person is already in a raptured condition they're prepared ready for the next step no more fear just living in faith and Truth to think that God hasn't given us a spirit of fear what an encouraging thought for a Believer facing demons and facing sickness and facing superstitions and facing idolatry and facing lifethreatening situations that God didn't give us the spirit of fear today Satan sends fear and as a Believer under the New Covenant scripture says these signs will follow them that they'll cast out devils in my name you have God's Authority so fear not don't make room for fear your duty as a Believer is to cast out fear to open your heart's door and to declare you won't Harbor here you won't live here you won't find place in my family scripture says give no place to the devil imagine if every believer here said fear you're not hiding in my soul you're not using my life to blend into the church I cast you out in jesus' name this building would overflow with Faith's power healing sickness and changing lives amen power would fill every heart because fear wouldn't rule anymore if every believer did their part J God chose your heart as a throne as Revelation place but fear has brought imaginations into your soul yes imagination sits where Faith should be sitting Revelation should be on your heart's throne but fear sits there instead you're imagining you'll fail imagining you can't make it and that lying devil tells you that you're Christian but you'll soon fall you can't live this life you won't make it look how other people aren't making it how will you make it look what the devil does the fear he puts on you but Abraham God sends this message to Believers that I didn't put fear in your heart so cast out your imagination scripture says cast down imaginations everything exalting itself above God's word amen and let me tell you what God's word brings God's word brings shity it brings truth it brings power it brings Deliverance it brings Liberty it brings peace it brings security it brings love yeah think about young David he was he was an afterthought of his family when the prophet came to anoint the next king he dealt with family rejection he wasn't included he wasn't even considered by his family but he was anointed by a prophet he was anointed to be a king he was anointed to slay Giants and when there was a Goliath in the land the Bible says in in 1 Samuel 1716 and the Philistine Drew near morning and evening and presented himself 40 days and I asked myself while studying this why would it be significant that the prophet who wrote this text mentioned that Goliath himself morning and evening and I found it significant because Believers in the morning and in the evening they would pray and recite scripture maybe through the day they are working but morning and evening was their time to pray and recite scripture and this devotion time was called the Shema and the sheema means to hear or listen and they would quote from Deuteronomy 64 to5 which I feel is a very important scripture and we'll see exactly why evening and morning is why sat the devil Satan Goliath stood and and tried to distract the people here o Israel the Lord our God is one you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your might and the they prayed these words as kind of a a pledge of allegiance if you will and so we find the giant of distraction was there during their time of Devotion to the Lord and he knew how to take the legs out from under a Believer amen but this little rejected boy who wasn't included with the crowd he was on the backside of some pasture somewhere he was Sanctified from the commotion he probably had a dirty face he probably came down the lane whistling some new Psalm he was coming up twisting his uh his slingshot nonchalant back and forth he strolled into the battlefield one day because his dad sent him out there to deliver food to his brothers amen but we found when he arrived there was an entire Army failing for fear and you can imagine they saw him and they asked him what's in your hand and brother Brandon said in 55 what's in thine hand he said what's in your hand he said a slingshot amen how you going to fight that giant out there with a 15 or 20 foot spear you couldn't get near him the way to defeat that type of enemy is just to keep distance from it the enemy of distraction keeping you out of the word keeping you crippled by fear and Little David whipped around his sling and cracked the stone through the skull of the Giant and brother Brenham said it would break the sound barrier and to think when things were unstable in the land the rock of faith is aimed at the enemy's head and by his own sword he's beheaded amen behead that giant things might be a little shaky but it's time to accelerate there's this uh when I was studying this I found this so so cool so interesting how this came together man named Chuck joerger some of you might have heard of him I think brother Brandon mentioned him actually uh he was the first man to break the sound barrier in in 1947 and he had a plane called The Bell X1 aircraft and he was interviewed and asked what his motivation was for doing this and he said when I was picked to fly the X1 it was my duty to fly it so I did it so he had a commission and he fulfilled the commission he said at high speeds the plane began to shake violently and he was afraid it would Shake something loose and it would it would crash he was already going fast and so he had three choices he could stay at that speed where everything around him was shaking and we'll call that the Pentecostal speed all right or he could slow down into the times of the past and go Leisure speed or he could press Full Throttle and push past the shaking and into an atmosphere a realm that has never been reached before and let me just say this today it's no coincidence that brother brandom's first recorded message in 1947 it's called faith is the substance and and we had a prophet in our day despite the instability of the world and despite the fear of breaking apart broke into an atmosphere of that other dimension because it was his duty it was his commission so why would you fear today think of how Paul tells a of his Warfare in Ephesians 6 we're not wrestling against flesh and blood but against principalities powers and the rulers of Darkness spiritual wickedness so your Warfare isn't natural it's spiritual you must go to realm to find victory over your life's enemy and Paul said our weapons aren't carnal this isn't a carnal battle but it's spiritual he's saying he won't give you physical weapons instead Paul gave what's mighty for tearing down spiritual strongholds amen it's near you it's in your mouth and what William Brandon preached was what Paul preed preached that Faith you've received from Paul's message is now in your mouth and how do we know this Revelation 109 says the angel took the book and said eat it where will it be in your mouth so Warfare rest in your mouth today thus sayith the Lord lives in every believer's lips because Abraham's God put his word in your mouth you can slice away the devil today you can slice him away with your confession confession with your belief the devil tells you that he'll take your life and he'll take your children slice his head off declare Jesus Christ has promised me my children he's promised me eternal life by the blood amen cut that devil up your confession can push the devil away watch the scripture in Ephesians 6 Paul would show us our defenses the helmet the shod fee that's defenses but Paul Paul turns to the sword of the spirit which is God's word so Paul's saying we're not just wearing defensive armor to withstand the devil's attack God's putting something in your hand to drive back your attacking enemy take what's over your life today and cast it beneath your feet and let the devil know Satan you're under my feet I won't listen I won't bow I won't Bend we're not helpless and we're not harmless we're Christ's bride with the word in the sword of the spirit we're Invincible we won't stop we won't be beaten we won't be driven back we'll overcome through the Lord's word the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony we have this right casting down every imagination throwing demons beneath our feet you ask if you can do it everyone here has the commission to cast down your enemy amen Hebrews 4:12 says God's word is and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword the word is powerful the word is sharp and the word is able and that's why scripture said they that overcome in Revelation 12 by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and you recognize today there are many strongholds you've got to recognize it for a stronghold amen do you know that depression is a stronghold and do you know that anxiety is a stronghold of the enemy and it's amazing that we're taught that these things are connected by fear David in his later years would fall into the stronghold I'll read 1st Samuel 21:10 to14 and David Rose and fled that day for fear of Saul and he went to akish the king of gath and the Servants of akish said unto him is not this David the king of the land did they not sing one to another of him and dance saying Saul hath slain his thousands and David his 10 thousands and David laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of akish the king of gath and he changed his behavior before him and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors in the gate and let his spittle fall down his beard then aish unto his servants said lo you see this man is mad wherefore then have you brought him to me now fear will make a king act insane to for fear running to gath and acting insane to cover up his complexes and to protect himself and he became a little bit paranoid he forgets his identity he gets spiritual Amnesia calls it spiritual Amnesia David he he to a himc the priests and then David came to KN to ahc the priest and ahc was afraid at the the meeting of David and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee and David said unto himc the priest the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee and what I have commanded thee and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place now therefore is understood thine what now therefore what is under thine Give Me Five Loaves of bread in mine hand are what there is present and the priest answered David and said there is no common bread under my hand but there is a hollowed bread if the young men kept themselves at least from women and David said unto ahc and is there not here under thine hand a spear or a sword now watch this for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the king's business required haste and the priest said the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom thou slew in the valley of elaw behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou will take that for there is no other save that here and David said there is none like that give it me now when David arrives at KN and and speaks priests and when the priest hands him the sword of Goliath David begins to remember his past victories and that he has been anointed to be king and that the Lord Pro divides and maybe some of you have been there you come to church defeated and distracted and and and fearful but you see the sword that cut the devil's head off and you begin to remember if it did it once it can do it again it just needs a hand of Faith to yield it amen remember the victories and the Triumph restore me back to my position help me to overcome complexes and fear and it put David in a position where he was able to sing I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall I Contin his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad he said oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lighted and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the the Lord heard me and saved me out of all of my troubles amen and watch the prophet as he addresses complexes there was these two Christian twin girls that moved into a city and one one of them stays solid in the faith and uh she had no issues with dresses or the long hair the other one gets around school girls and reasoning enters her mind she thinks well they go to church and and they dress different and they cut their hair why can't I and you got to remember today this isn't about man's reasoning it's it's not about fear of of what other people think it's about obedience to the word of God and that little school girl she got confused and caught between two opinions and she developed spiritual Amnesia she lost her identity and she built complexes and she ended in an insane institution and brother brandom said she didn't speak for 2 years her parents came to him for help and brother bham visited and Vision came and he said thus sayith the Lord shall be completely healed the little girl's mother nudged her and said just think of it he's never been wrong amen within only a few hours that same day they called brother brandom and the girl had fully recovered think of it he's never been wrong and what else did he say he said there would be a bride that would come to herself he said there would be a Rapture he he said an angel appeared and said not even cancer could stand before him amen it's only fear brother Brenham said fear in this hour he says watch fearful sights are everywhere fear is everywhere the Bible says men men's hearts are failing for fear but the message of the hour comes along and the prophets looking at the same thing that they're looking at he's looking at fears he's looking at insecurity s he's looking at complexes he lost his child and he lost his wife and people turned on him people talk bad about him he had many friends but really he had no friends if you understand what I mean there but he had Jesus and despite everything he says to the church he says shalom shalom to the church don't fear he says shalom LOM peace to the church he said the reason things are getting so bad he said because the lights is pressing the darkness together the reason things are falling apart is because the rock is coming the stone has been heed the mountain the economies and the World Systems they've they've got to go but we are not to fear what's happening it's God bringing Mercy to his church the Apostle Paul could say fear not Jesus could say fear not and brother brandham could say fear not Shalom and I think of David the psalmist in Psalms 23 when he's saying I will fear no as I walk through that Valley has nothing to do with who I am or what I do amen but I will fear no evil for thou are with me why was the prophet speaking to the church Shalom and not fear it's because he was introducing to the church that Christ has come among you it's not time to fear it's time to believe this is not a fearful time this is a time to believe I will fear no evil for thou art with me Amen in Isaiah 43 the prophet Isaiah says very clearly thus sayith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not I have redeemed Thee the world cannot touch you you are here with an anointing of the son of man you have come into the word of the hour we are here to drive back that enemy we're not here to be destroyed we're not here to fall we're not here to be today we're we're we're not here to be cast down but we're here to fulfill the word of the hour amen this bride is not going backwards in Retreat we're not returning back to how things used to be going forward we're pressing on we're going into the promises of God this is the hour for a Believer the Holy Ghost has a message for you the spirit has one message for a Believer speak the word and go forward you are to go forward today over your adversary go forward today over your sickness go forward today over your complexes go forward today over your fears you're to speak the word and take a step but you say brother Nick there's no way how do I take a step there's no way out of here there's no place to go but the Bible tells us even in the time of Joshua when they came up to the River Jordan if you recall that when the high priest put his foot in the water there was no way until he made the first step and then God moved and he made the opening amen someone had to be the first one to take a step and I wonder today is there a believer in the house of God that will take a step of faith and speak the word and move forward be not afraid it is I the Lord Has Come among you he is here to deliver and he is here to give power amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but watch this watch this back in job 19 something begins to come to him and it's a little different than what he was saying before before it was darkness and before it was fear and before it was questioning but now he says for I know my redeemer lives he sees the Redeemer and when he sees the Redeemer it causes him to see himself he says for I know that my redeemer liveth that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I will see God and that's the difference that's different than what he had said earlier amen earlier it's a land of Darkness I don't know what happens after death but now he says though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I will see God so been given a hope for Resurrection amen yeah now let's go to Job 38 then the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by the words without knowledge and by the way I forgot to put my timer on so we're here till we're done amen G up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me where were you see now he's giving him a message about the mind of God where were you when I laid the foundation you're worried about what's after but this message is here to tell you about what's before amen for what's before if your answer was after I hope I hope you understand what this message came to do it's not a message of what's before it's a message of what's after after it's a message of what's in the mind of God in fact the prophet stood on the platform and he would say I want to preach to you what was in the mind of God what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world we're going to see by God's help he said he unfolded it all the way down into the present time that we're living in amen think about it think about this church all the way down before time began don't worry about what's after let's find out where you were before death ever was where were where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding do you understand do you understand the language that's been given to us when he says I'm predestinated when he says I was with God before the foundation of the world where were you yeah job just said I don't know because it was all Darkness to him but this message has brought light to you these are these are precious things in in the eyes of God do you see that think about what he's saying God's asking you a question this morning declare if you have understanding what I've just asked you where were you and if you understand where you were it will change your whole life it will change your whole approach to the enemy for the Bible says Don't Fear Satan fear God when the morning Stars sang together and sons of God shouted for Joy God was answering job's question by causing him to look at him who was before the darkness the fear of death and hell has held billions in bondage to the unknown the fear of seeing themselves walk down the same path that thousands and thousands of others have walked down with the same symptoms and that triumph over man fear but when Jesus took the keys from Satan he lost his power over the people all the superstitions were replaced with faith and a risen savior amen listen to this if Satan holds the keys of death he's telling the people they're hid from The Secret of immortality they don't know what immortality is but Paul comes along after Jesus rose and he says this corruptible must put on incorruption Amen and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory he said oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy victory oh my oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain the Lord and this is why brother brandom said when Paul is being brought out to the chopping block and he lays his head down there and and you know death should cause fear to come upon a person but he wasn't fearful at The Chopping Block he looked at that old place and brother Brenham said in the message the angel of the Lord he said that the grave said I'm going to hold your body but Paul said you're trying to scare me but you can't scare me grave where is your Victory Satan has lost his keys he can hide in religion but his strength has been stripped from him amen and if his strength has been stripped from him who is stronger than him that's able to strip his strength our Lord am remember Satan says you're finished it's over he's doing that because he looks like he's got an army behind him Satan thinks he has all the odds against you and he really pours it on but remember now if the Lord Jesus has the keys of death and hell then he left all of those keys through the scriptures for us amen you're a winner and Satan is defeated all throughout the Bible you understand every one of these stories that we read about they started with certain defeats staring them in the face come on you guys see that right come on Church you're no different than anybody else in the Bible just the name has changed but it's still the same devil the difference is he's lost his keys there he had keys now he has no keys amen and when the word begins to mean more to you than death and life we understand that this word is power this word is Majesty this word is a declaration of independence before the enemy this word has prepared a table before my enemy he anointeth me in the presence of my enemy amen where were you where were you when the sons of shouted when the morning Stars sang where God is are shouts amen where God is is vict songs of praise songs of testimony trophies in the house of God are testimonies of the Saints and bear with me I'm laying a foundation but notice where did these testimonies come from they came from the enemy Satan has lost Keys Satan has lost his victory Satan has lost his power over you his power to hold you down his power to keep you defeated his power to tell you that you're not a son of God why do you think brother brandham said in in Christ is the mystery why is the devil howling let's read that quote but I'm talking about the headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question this morning we have the the answer to the devil's question Christ is risen and has paid the price and raising up a body the devil can't stand it that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness has been uncovered by the Risen Resurrection Christ yes in the head over his body Glory you know why he's howling because he sees the light of immortality coming over the horizon the devil is going to see a resurrection I said the devil is going to see a resurrection that's why theil is howling it's going home time amen we're leaving there's a rapture taking place so long Goodbye World I don't know about you that makes me happy good goodbye sin goodbye to this world my my but in case some of you are still a little worried and don't know if we've really got the victory let me show what what the Lord showed us in type and Shadow and you remember there was a a man in the Bible named Gideon who was fearful he was fearful he was scared when he was trying to get anything from God he hid behind the wine press because because of the power of the enemy amen he was told by an Angel in judges 6:23 do not fear and yet he was still afraid to face the enemy the oppression of the enemy was everywhere so he hid to try to get his blessings amen you know he's he's one of those Believers that just sneak in and and sneak out amen but the Lord appeared to him and said Mighty Man of Valor and he said Lord I'm the least in my household how could I and he said you're a mighty man of Valor I have caused you I have called you and I have raised you up to deliver Israel from from the hands of these powers and there were three powers there were midianites there were amalekites and there were children of the East amen the Bible said that they came without number they ate up the grass drove the people out of their homes till they lived in dens and caves of the earth and in judges 7:9 the Bible says and it came to pass the same night that the Lord s unto to him arise and get thee down unto the host for I have delivered it into thine hand so this is what God had already promised him he said just attack you've got the victory but if thou fear goe with FOH thy servant down to the host and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go unto F unto the host then went down with Pharaoh then he went down to with Pharaoh his servant unto the house of the Armed men that were in the host so Gideon if you're afraid to attack I want you to go down and I want you to listen to what your enemy is saying about you and afterward you'll be encouraged and you'll be confident amen and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the East lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for for multitude and their cam camels were without number as the Sand by the Sea by the seaside for multitude and Gideon arrived just as a man so Gideon he's there now he's eased dropping on the enemy he's listening into what they're saying and the enemy said that a man is is he's telling a friend his dream he said I had a dream that a round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the midianite and it struck the tent with such a force that the tent was overturned and collapsed and his friend responded this can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon now Gideon he's facing an enemy that's about 250,000 troops and he begins with about 32,000 so he's got like a small tiny Fighting Chance and one day 22,000 people from that army they decided that they don't want the fight they're not interested in fighting 250,000 people so he's down to a much smaller number then the number of 10,000 9,700 walk away so we find that they're all Idol worshippers and they're fearful and he's left with 300 men amen normally that's a really bad day so there's no chance no possibility that 300 men can take on 250,000 that's actually terrifying odds and so God gives Gideon some advice he says he says I want you to go listen to what your enemy is saying he didn't send him to an apostle and he didn't send him to a prophet and he did not give him another Angelic visitation he already had those experiences and he knew what the scriptures said about the victories of Joshua and the others that went before for him but he was still fearful he still doubted so God said okay I want you to hear what your enemy is saying if you hear what your enemy says about you you would have confidence the enemy thinks about us and he and he has conversations about us he has nightmares about us and a son of God who knows who they are is Hell's worst nightmare you remember in Portland OR brother brandom he was preaching and that huge demon-possessed man came running up to him and he was spitting and cussing and threatening to break brother Brandon's bones and it's because the devil knows who God's people are because you have challenged the servant of God in jesus' name ye shall fall at my feet and that's where he stayed the devil knows who you are but he's helpless a bluff he's trying to scare you he's a toothless liing he's a liar he's our enemy he's defeated today now Gideon over hears the enemy having this dream about him having nightmares about him and Gideon realizes that he underestimates the threat that he is he underestimates how the enemy sees him and God's people underestimate who we are we underestimate the threat that we are as the bride of Christ it's one thing to be encouraged When God says you're a mighty man of Valor and it's one thing to be encouraged by your brothers the 300 that stood by your side against this massive enemy that greatly outnumbered you that's another thing to have them encourage you but to know the enemy really thinks about you to realize the boasts of the enemy all all along were a bluff Gideon discovered that all of hell was having nightmares about him the enemy is having nightmares that you'll realize who you are God told Gideon you have no idea how powerful you are what's his response but I'm the least of my father's house and my father's house is the least of Israel there's no way I what you're asking me to do why don't you just go down and listen to what your enemy has to say about you so let's recognize there's God's view there's Earth's View and there's the enemy's view amen Heaven's view is Gideon you're a mighty man of Valor Earth's view I'm the least in my father's house the enemy's view that loaf of of bread is a sword coming to kill us we're shaking in our boots we're trembling we're tered now all throughout scripture you see the differences in these views there's a little child laid in a manger and God's view is that's the seed and his heel will crush the enemy's head he will end up taking back the keys of death and the keys of hell and the keys of the Grave Earth's don't even give him a room at the in put him in a barn most miss it right in front of them in the enemy's view Herod says kill all the mill children under the age of three they say the Messiah is here my kingdom is about to end that's why we come and we hear the message of we need bread we need sustenance bread speaks of the word of God Amen hell sees it as an army being trained hell knows that principalities and powers and rulers of Darkness are being disarmed as the word Goes Forth today hell sees Goliath's head being chopped off hell sees job realizing that his Redeemer liveth says that the enemy was like Locust that the camels outnumbered the sands on the seashore why would we need to know 200 and 50,000 troops stood against this man and why on Earth would they feel that they needed 250,000 troops and that kind of Weaponry for 300 men it's because they know that God said he was mighty and the enemy knows that if God calls you mighty it has everything to fear no matter what the odds are let's listen to the enemy for a moment you consider if you will with me the size of the attack what's the level of attack that's been launched against your life 250,000 demons let me ask you a question why the sickness why the rejection why the abandonment why the abuse why the Heartbreak why the loneliness the discouragement the depression why the feeling of be being eaten up with worry why the sense of feeling like you don't measure up like you're just a failure why the constant attacks from the enemy every time you try to rise the enemy is there to hit you in some way shape or form all of hell is attacking this bride of Jesus Christ and all of hell is against this message that let you know how the enemy sees you he's not launching that kind of attack against somebody that's not a threat but because he knows that God has said you're mighty he knows that God has said he's with you and he's going to do great things through you and he's going to do great things you that he's going to deliver you the devil attacks you at an equal level of the calling on your life and that bread of life is is is a life flow to us but it's a death blow to the enemy right now now if you want to know the enemy's real condition this morning read Colossians 2:15 the Bible says that he was disarmed it says here there was a public speculation or spectacle made of him and he was put to open that that's powerful to think of to realize not only did Jesus go and disarm him of the keys of death and hell and the grave and stripped him down but according to the Ancient Warfare that Paul was referring to there Colossians when one Army overtook another they would strip the king down of his Royal garments they would take his throne and they would take his weaponry and they would chain him to the other soldiers they wouldn't leave him in the battle case scenario he would live and they would take him to the city square of the Conquering Kingdom of their own kingdom and the people would Gather in a great celebration and like a parade they would March the enemy around stripped down to nothing they'd March around not only disarmed but now making a public demonstration a public spectacle of the defeat putting the king to open shame letting the people know that now the threat is gone that the threat is over it's defeated the Bible says that one day we'll look back on Satan who cost us all this pain and we'll say one we'll say that's the one that we allowed to so much pain and so much heartache in our life I'll tell you what a public spectacle is today a public spectacle is when that woman has received a terrible diagnosis and throws her arms up in defiance of the devil and praises the Lord a public spectacle is when that young lady s oppression but overcomes with praises to her king that's a public spectacle when the Lord will pull someone from the pits of Hell from drugs from sex horrible pornography whatever he's pulled you from the gutters and you're here today that is in Defiance that is a public spectacle praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so Gideon heard what the enemy was saying before he was afraid now he gets up and says it's time they grab their lamps and Gideon's instructions were to break the covering on the lamp so the lamp could shine and then to shout amen So the instructions were whatever has to be broken let it be broken off so you can shine and you can shout amen that's how the victory is won you shine and you shout the sword of the Lord and the sword of Gideon so the enemy ran and fled because gide Gideon began to have a revelation of of God's sword this is the sword of the Lord and the sword of Gideon who was having the dream the enemy who was giving the interpretation the enemy why do you think our Prophet said look at all the signs around you it's the enemy telling you that the bride has won the [Applause] fight amen I want you to know the enemy is not here to win this battle he knows his time that's why he went to Jesus and he said have you come to to torment us before our time he knows his time the enemy knows he can't hold your children the enemy knows he can't keep you down the enemy knows you have prayed and the Lord has heard your prayer and it's over for your enemy this is the devil's Nightmare and I wonder how many nightmares is he having tonight not just a loaf of but a mighty Army a bride Marching In step the devil's backing up because he sees the same look in your eyes that he saw in the one that said I am alive forever more Jesus said fear not I have the keys of hell and death Jesus handed you those same keys if we could stand to our feet thank you Lord Jesus can we all shout some something yeah the sword of the Lord and of Gideon I'm sure we can all find something to praise the Lord about we all have something that we can put Praise on our lips something deep in our heart that we reach out and praise him for we just read the enemy's defeated the enemy's defeated today sometimes things look dark sometimes things look glim but no that fear is of the put fear back where it belongs put it in the devil's Camp he's there bluffing you getting you to think that you are the one that's fearful realistically it's him who's fearful of you rising up rise up today as an army rise up today as the bride of Christ and say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon amen amen I've got one more little story I'd like to tell it's uh if you're history buff you you may have read this Napoleon bonapart uh it's it's interesting this this man was a vicious vicious conqueror he pillaged the world but one day he was defeated and they actually exiled him they sent him to Exile they didn't want him to be a martyr and while in Exile was standing there with
