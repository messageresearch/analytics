right note aren't we amen praise the Lord thank you brother amen Joshua and all the musicians amen thank you all for the worship service thank everybody for coming out Amen on this stormy night praise the Lord at least we're not going through a foot of snow amen so praise the Lord amen God is good amen we'll just bow our heads kind Heavenly Father we come before you Lord thanking you again Lord for a beautiful day that you've given us it was a little bit cooler today Lord and we just thank you Father for it and ask God now tonight as we have assembled ourselves together in your name that here you would be in our midst Lord and father truly may we be able to say father when we leave here that not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way we ask God that you'll bless the medit ation of a heart that which we feel you've laid upon a heart to minister Lord we ask God that you would just give us the ability and the anointing and the anointing father that only can come from you Lord and for those streaming tonight Lord we ask God that you would just be with them in a special way and help us to learn Lord from this lesson God that I feel you have brought to my attention and laid on my heart to speak tonight for we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord amen if you will turn your Bibles to Ephesians the book of Ephesians this will be again this will go along with our series Amen on releasing the power of God and you know I've been thinking about that but and it has to do it really has to do with that and so uh that's why I kind of connected in there amen learning how to be a better Christian how many wants to learn to be a better Christian there's some questions questions that I'd like to kind of answer with the help of the Lord a kind of a question that I have had in my mind a little bit going uh some of the things the prophet of God said amen and then perhaps we'll have a better understanding it of it it's always good when you have a question when you ask God a question amen it's nice if you catch it when he answers you is't it amen because he'll answer you amen God always answers we're just not always listening amen sometimes maybe it's not the answer we want but there was just a little question that I had amen and uh so we're just GNA continue I think where we was at last time we talked about when we was ministering we was into the land of the promised land amen being placed in the promised land amen and uh not wanting to go out there outside of the promised land get getting off uh Mount zir I guess it was getting off the mountain away from the mountain and quit circling around things and so forth and go on into the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that's our promised land is it right amen and we found out there that even though uh you are in the promised land we know that um that doesn't mean that you're free from Wars isn't that right doesn't mean that you're free from war now after you're in that don't mean that you're free from war you still have to fight for every inch of ground amen that you stand on amen amen so you know and we want to try to with the help of the Lord look at that tonight because my head question you know uh we're we're in a battle we're in a constant battle and there's another scripture where brother Bram says you know that real genuine faith is completely based upon rest and God fights your battles for you amen so are we resting or are we fighting which one are we doing amen amen and so uh you know I just had that question I said how why would we have to fight for every inch of ground amen that we get one place I was seeing where where uh brother Brandon was talking about um Moses and those uh Israelites he says now I've given you the land now go get it now go take it now go fight for it I've given it to you but you're going to have to fight for every inch you get am man and I don't really understand that to give me a little detail about that right just kind of broad right there you know but I like I like I like detail I like detail and amen maybe tonight we can go in there a little bit more detailed about what this battle really is amen how many wants to learn about what this battle is really all about what in the world are we fighting you know what do we got to fight amen amen and so what is our land that we want to go possess and what we want to go take amen well it's not as far away as what you might think amen so in Ephesians 4 no it's not four Ephesians 6 amen I don't know if you got that to put up there in Carson or not brother Carson all right finally Brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the Devils amen so Paul's certainly saying here that if you're going to be strong in the power of the might amen man you better put on the whole armor of God so you'll be able to stand against what the Devil comes at you with so the devil's going to come at you isn't he no he's not just going to take a break he's going to keep coming at you am me I unfortunately I hate to tell you this but this battle is going to take place and it's going to keep on going amen until we get out of here amen till you get out of here you're going to be fighting this battle for we wrestle not against flesh and blood now first of all we realize here that we're not having a fist fight here no anybody that takes it and does like Peter said and I'm cut his ear off you know mean this is not a physical fight no it's not a natural fight it's a spiritual fight in this in the spiritual realm anytime somebody takes it into the natural amen something about the Bible says you know know this that the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God Amen that's right so it's not flesh and blood it's not a flesh and blood battle it's a principalities it's Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places for for take unto you the whole armor of God that you be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your lawy about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel and above all take the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight I really like that last verse don't you amen what is it that's going to quench all the fiery darts of that Wicked one it's Faith amen so the battle is between faith and doubt amen faith and doubt amen so my question kind of was Lord what what is this battle what do we fight where's our real battle at amen amen and I want to parallel parallel two thing two things I want to try to bring to a parallel one of them is that when the children of Israel went into the promised land brother brandham says it this way they slayed amorites and Hittites he says and there wasn't one hurt among them among any of them until sin came into the camp when aen took that Babylonian garment and that gold wedge and hid it on under his Camp amen and the next day they lost 36 men ain't that right amen and and Joshua said wait a minute stop there's something wrong here is't that right they all went on a fast you that right God made us a promise there will be nothing heard among us nobody will be able to stand before you is that right is that a promise of the believer that your enemy is not supposed to be able to stand before you n it's got to go whatever that enemy is it's got to go if you're in the place that you're supposed to be now why did they die brother B say why did these innocent men die because one man stepped out of line amen praise the Lord the reason that this needs to be taught tonight the church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with God and lining up with each other walking perfect perfectly up upright soberly before all men fearing amen and fearing God so we want to look at that we want to look first of all that they all had to stay in line they all had to stay in order aen did not but he got out of order isn't that right he got out of line amen now before I go to the other side I want to take you to a message brother the brand and preach and this is what I feel like the Holy Spirit took me it's something that I've preached many times here so don't think that it's something new but we'll just see what the Lord will do with it all right but I I think by by the end of the service you'll see why it's so important but uh anyway so first we realize that why I wrote down here why does man always why do we need why do we look for fortification why do we look for security amen why do we build things amen like uh the first thing that we can think of how that man amen the reason that we uh built fortifications and and places of shelter is because we realize we're living in a dangerous world a world of mortality amen you know I was sitting there on my chair on the front porch and I've been shooting some sparrows because they're take trying to take over my Martin box and I said well Lord you wrote in the Bible I guess he said you knew I was going to shoot some Martins because you know the fall of every Sparrow he know it's the fall of a sparrow ain't that right but I thought you know isn't it something how did man I could just turn that gun on my horse my cow my dog my cat I could turn my gun on any of them and shoot him and kill him and I thought what a terrible thing isin't that right and I thought you know because we're living in a world of mortality isin't that right and that's why evil people that's why Hitler did what he did ain't that right because we're living in a Mor a world of mortality I thought aren't you looking forward to the time that no people can try to shoot you no there won't be nobody shooting you if it did it' just go through you ain't that right immortality no no you can't be killed I'm looking for a world where you can't be killed amen and so it's really a terrible world to live in De trying to cross the road and everything you get hit all the animals I always hate to see all of that now how many believes you are looking and were longing for a place of immortality I heard brother bam talking in adoption series I've been listening to that he was talking about you know how that he was C caught up in that other dimension and he said says since that he says I don't have one lick of fear one bit of fear of death and he said you don't have to either amen you don't have to fear because over there he was transported over there and then he got to talking about he said Paul he said that he was that was the maybe a first Heaven he said that he was caught up into the third heaven and couldn't even speak of it how many Heavens are out there brother Tommy what's it going to be life we can't imagine then that just comes to my mind having listened to it he says you know this world and where we're living in he says it's like a burning City down that has all of the smell of the rats and all the garbage and that smoke in that vapor and he says man when you go when he went to a certain place and he had to get a whiff of that he says oh man it would be terrible he says now we're not of the Cesspool we're not of that debauchery of the world but we're still living in that type of Bacher world that type of a stinking World we're looking for a better place aren't we amen now it's kind of what brought me to this my my thought of it it looks like I'm jumping around here because amen but I want to talk basically I was thinking on the Warfare that we're in amen and I was thinking of it in a in a uh sense of defense is that right something to Amen to where it it stops the enemy from coming in ain't that right cuz Satan like a roaring lion Peter said goes about seeking whom he may devour so he's going to attack and we're going to have to have a defense we're going to have to have a shield we're going to have to have protection we're going to have to have fortification ain't that right amen and man fortification I want talk about for just a minute amen even it doesn't uh all the way back you go all the way back all the way to perhaps uh nimrod's time after the flood how many knows that Nimrod tried to build a tower so high that God could flood the Earth and they could climb that Tower can I say something imagine Humanity being so dumb that they think they can outsmart God God they thought they were smart but they were pretty dumb weren't they I mean didn't it come into their minds that you know there is such a thing as earthquakes it might just shake it over a little bit you know there's uh what do you call those sink holes God can take that Tower down with with his fingernails you know just nothing but they wanted security because they didn't want to be able to be destroyed again amen how many believes we Flee for our life amen flee amen we have fled for Refuge the Bible says we have fled for Refuge amen and that Refuge is never in anything manmade nope Amen brother Braham talked about fortification when he talked about the French after the first world war built the magnet line I believe it was amen the magnet line they had all these cannons turned TOS Germany but Germany went right around them amen is that right and then Germany built the seek free line 630 some miles of fortification concrete and that didn't work either didn't it no it didn't work us Americans we think we're so secure we got all these nuclear bombs we got these nule Subs where oh man we're the top of the food chain when it comes to military but how many knows we're going to think different whenever those bombs are going through disguise that's fixing the fry our hide that's right there's a fire coming no no you're not secure only place you're secure is in Christ Nebuchadnezzar and ab belti Shazer if you remember they thought they were secure behind their walls the superpower of that time amen getting the vessels so that came from the the temple and having a drinking wine and having a party brother said a rock and roll party with all of these beatnicks and twists and all of the man to Wine women and all of that he says y to think that God don't see you you aren't never so fortified and that's a lot of times when people amen get slacked and everything else when they think they're so fortified and so secure amen after tonight you'll find out that you have to be on your toes all the time you have to be on guard I think it was Paul said let him that thinketh that he standeth take heat least he fall so even when you're standing having done all to stand stand therefore even when you are standing you still have to be on guard CU if you are not on guard tomorrow something's going to happen amen every day you have to be on guard every hour of every day hey the enemy cries to come in and he has lots of doors to come in at lots of ways to come in at lots of different things that happen to us sometimes that causes the enemy to come in and to be able to come in we want to look at some of those things is that okay praise the Lord all right praise the Lord Colossians said I didn't put a sticker in there did I Philippians Colossians 3 says for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God Amen how many believes that our life is hid with God let me read you a couple Psalms before we get get going here Psalms 57 it's uh David said it this way he said be merciful unto me oh God be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee y in the shadow of of thy Wings will I make my refuge amen until these calamities be overpassed oh wow how many know we got some calamities going I will cry unto God most high unto God that performeth all things for me and he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up amen God shall send forth his mercy and his truth my soul is among life lions and I lie among them that are set on fire even the sons of men who th are Spears and arrows and and their tongue is a sharp sword amen David knew what it was like to live with people that it wanted to destroy him amen be thou exalted the Lord above the heavens let thy glory be above all the Earth they have prepared net for my steps and my soul is bowed down they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are Fallen themselves how many believes that when people set a trap for you they set a pit for you if you've got God on your side they're the ones that end up in there just like Daniel and the Lions then and that right there are the ones that end up getting fed the Lions praise praise be to the Lord why do you think David said I will praise the Lord am mean that's why I'll praise you because you are my refuge You Are My Strength God is my refuge amen strong and mighty tower listen after this giant David slays four giant Philistine Warriors listen after that he says verse chapter 22 of 2 Samuel and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hands of all of his enemies out of the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my Rock Amen my Fortress and my deliverer how many know David realized that he never delivered himself it was always God that delivered him I'm here to tell you if you are ever delivered it wasn't by your hand it was by the hand of almighty God woo praise the the Lord what was it brother bam talked about as the deer Panthers for the water Brook got to get to that water got to get that water or like a rabbit where the hounds of hell are coming after him ain't that right and that rabbit is just to getting it as hard as he can in the heart breath of them them H them uh wolves or dog or whatever might be right on his H but what is it there's a rock somewhere it's got a hole in it amen and just as that that little old rabbit dives into that rock that maybe the a dog hits his head against the rocks that little old rabbit can sit back there in the little Nest that he create it back there put his head over his head and say I'm so thankful for this rock and I'm here to tell you Amen in the land of sinking sand amen amen every s sinking sand but God has ack amen that you're anchor to tonight amen and we praise God you can sit back and say oh I thank God Amen in the midst of this storm in the midst of this sinking sand God has a rock for you to hide in Thou Art my rock Thou Art my Fortress you're my fortification Christ the holy spirit is your fortification from every evil thing that's out there and trust me there's many many many evil things out there amen amen you don't think I as a pastor watch for those evil things amen not to come in among us not to destroy you you don't think your pastor watches out for you your soul no I just love beating you no I don't just leave love beating you I'm not that kind of a dad even God disciplines he says he chastises us for our good when he beats me it's for my good amen God Is My Rock in him will I trust he is my shield and the Horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge My Savior amen amen he says what we just read the scripture where he puts his trust under the shadow of his wings brother B said our uh bomb shelter is made out of feathers amen out of feathers our shelter is out of feathers what is this God's Great wings what is his wings his wings are the Old Testament his wings are the New Testament our faith is in the god of the Old Testament to God in the New Testament and our faith is in the word of God Amen and that is the oh my it's the best protection you'll ever have people building storm shelters or should I say bomb shelters and man they've got all kinds of tribulation shelters and food and everything else but are they in for disappointment all right so there you go you got you a tribulation shelter and everybody else gets destroyed you get to walk out there by yourself with nobody around what fun is that oh you got the whole world to yourself don't take that mask off because everything's so radioactive you'll die oh we'll have our mask on it's called the new body amen radiation ain't going to bother us a bit amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord you love him that's right so he is Christ is our shelter Shelter From what Shelter From what so let's first of all look what is our enemy what's the greatest enemy yeah it's not so much the devil the greatest battle ever fought is what we're going to teach out of tonight that okay the greatest battle that ever fought and it's been raging it's been raging I wrote down on my paper since the beginning of time and I scribbled out that beginning and I said since before time yeah this battle has been raging long before time ever began how many believe that amen it's your ass all right let's start I don't know if you can get the first quote up or not I sent him some quotes we're going to try it if not I've got it on my iPad amen one thing I don't have brother Bram said in be as he began he says you know how that he says uh the devil really is harmless unless he's got somebody to work through how many believes that the devil is pretty much harmless unless he's got somebody to work through and he says God is kind of the same way not that he can't but he also has to have somebody to work through so that's where the battle is it's a battle for control amen and we want to look at this battle that we talk about what are we fighting for where are we fighting amen all right first one goes like this I went to bed and I begin to think of those one of those that get out of place and if yall remember brother bam was out in the open and he looked at the stars the galaxy the whole creation isin't that right and he thoughted about them as being the Heavenly hosts is that right and he talked about how that if one of those they all set in their place and if there's a moving anywhere of them it's for a cause and it will affect this Earth and we just see the results of it now from some of them moving out of their spots it's effective it affects every everything and I thought that if that great Heavenly Host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the he Earthly host how when one gets out of order a that right kind of like aen when one gets out of order if the moon would shift from what I understand if the moon would move butram says the tidle waves that come on in that Moon controls the the waves now this comes fresh in other words I think what he meant by that was I don't have it wrote down but you think about the Moon that it keeps its place it keeps the waters from overflowing us and the church is a type of that Moon ain't that right and how many knows the church got out of her place why do you think that we've got the flood of sin he says you watch sin coming now you watch you just come swim and get in and go all the way Plum to the core that's right because the Pentecostal Baptist all of them they should have got in line think of the Millennium we could have had amen if all of those churches would have got in line with the revealed word of the hour but now they rejected the reveal word of the hour they got out of place and now what we got assess pull of in like you've never seen he looks at those and says my amen when get one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit and I would to God this morning that we would bring this to a real healing service that we could keep this group that we have gathered under this roof this morning in such a Harmony that the Holy Spirit would place every member of the body that's here this morning in such Harmony till there would be such a spontaneous healing of the body and soul if we'll just hold our possessions amen hold our positions adoption series brother bam says you know I'm looking at some older sisters in their 60s pretty faed mothers that would say well what have I ever done you know what have I ever done for God he said you have done what God wanted you to do you've raised your children God has a place for you ain't that right that was what God wanted you to do that was your place some farmer going out there and all I did is plow and do this that or the other but says that's what God wanted you to do do what God wants you to do you want to get in trouble church people listen to this listen to me you want to get in trouble try to take somebody else's place that's right try to be like brother John back there try to be like brother Josh or Caleb or Lisa hello well they do this and I want to do that and they're like this and I want to be like that no just do what God wants you to do it's stay in the place God called you to be even a doctor says man I would take my horse and so forth and go down through the creeks and and and and treat people and mothers having babies and and little kids with headaches and tummy AES and everything else and wonder if God got a place for me but yes God will have a place for people like you amen why because it did what God called them to do get out of well I'll tell you you get out of where God wants you to be I've said this many times over this pop you want to get in trouble get out of where God wants you to be I don't care what where that is wherever it is whatever it is amen amen all right the whole program of God is upset achen got 36 men killed all of their kids didn't have a daddy the women were widows and then he ended up getting his own wife and his own children killed and burn Lord help us let's look at what we got to find fight tonight how many wants to tonight I I I officially call this a military training session tonight we and you are in a military training camp tonight and I got to quote for it amen oh my oh that's what he was doing brother Brandon was trying to get us this group together to where it's such a spontaneous holy Spirit come down come down on the word ain't that right until the soul will be healed the body will be healed I'm a True Believer that when the word Goes Forth If you're receiving it as from God there ain't no telling what can happen if you've come to church for healing you've come to the right place you come for deliverance you've come to the right place we haven't cut a hole in the roof yet brother Tommy to bring people in they did in the book of Acts they cut a hole in the roof we're going to get him there somehow amen all right praise the Lord I've got 11 quotes we're on the second one now listen as I said at the beginning this lady who had cancer at the doctor was going to take off now God that caused the fluttering noise to come into that clinic and took that cancer without even leaving a scar don't you know that that same God is here the only thing that he's waiting for is for his army to get in position like the stars get in position how many times have we been told if anybody ever got healed if you'll meet the same same conditions that they met you'll get your healing amen but you got to meet those same conditions you got to come to that same place well what is that well for one thing but for brother brandham it was eating the puke that he threw up because he believed by his stripes I'm Healed in three days from now I'm going to be better or perhaps from three days from now they're going to have to bury me cuz Mom was over there crying don't eat it Billy don't eat it it'll kill you well then it'll kill me but I'm taking it I'm taking God at his word amen he had to fight for it is't that right that's right waiting for them to get into positions and I won't go through this we already know that there's only two Powers ain't that right two kingdoms every disorder everything that comes along it's either God's power or Satan's power there's only two Powers there is and I want to tell you this that everything that comes into your mind every thought that goes into your mind is either God's thought the devil's thought amen praise the Lord and so a army first in getting ready for a battle first there's got to be a select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting and they've got to be trained for fighting now how many knows I believe that's why brother bandam preaching this now so think about this in this greatest battle ever fought brother bandam recognized the Heavenly Host he are recognized and brought in about some of these things about the order of things ain't that right and how that first it has to be trained that's what we want to do tonight when you go to training for your school or this that or the other how many goes to A8 hour class for 5 days is't that right Caleb to learn to be a truck driver you got to go for several weeks eight hours a day ain't that right here we are tonight maybe for an hour training that's not a whole lot hope we get a bunch tonight a't that right we're going to have to pack it in here but that's what we're doing we're training we're getting train wo my my goodness well let me tell you let me see here I've got Thomas's book of theology his version of what a battle's all about are you ready to hear it doesn't sound good at all no even I throw it away get rid of that thing no but what do we got a Vindicated Prophet anointed by God himself that when we read those quotes when we read those scriptures you can count on that amen you're going to get the proper training it's going to be accurate it's going to be right when you get out there tomorrow to fight that devil amen he's going to be [Applause] defeated as a matter of fact right now brother say some final battle is going on right now not only are you in training but you're in a battle amen amen that's right you're going to have to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting and I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought he now ready to go into action and he took the scripture from Daniel there will be a time such as there never was before but Abram says you're living in that time that such as never was before like never before amen amen the greatest battle that was ever for is now ready to go into action I believe that God is selecting his solders ERS I believe that he's dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start amen the great this great first battle that was ever fought beginning Heaven Before Time this battle has been raging since before time been going on a long time amen and we know that this battle that started in heaven brother B says then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings then the battle from Angels become human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation and God that God created to be for himself the Devil comes to destroy it that's what is his purpose is is to destroy it and then that battle begin here on Earth it begin in us and has been raging ever since amen where is the battle what do we got to fight for what are we fighting for before any battle can be put in Array they first must have a choosing place a choosing ground where this battle is going to be fought with this elected PE place is't that right Amen Let me see now in the first World War they selected a place it was a no man's land is where they fought in the world first world war so the place that it's fought is in no man's land no man's land I'm going to call it the land of choice the land of choosing and brother bam did in the mind where decisions are made is that right in other words it can go either way it can go either way this battle that we're fighting is in a place called Choice amen and it's in the mind my my my that's right a mutual place no man's land and they fight there at this place they don't just fight here and there amen that's where the Battlefront is where they test their powers where each Army tests its strength against the other Army a mutual meeting place listen to what he says here this is kind of off the subject but listen to what it is if this church right now could be put together knit together with such love that every person would be in one Accord with not one shadow of a doubt nowhere there wouldn't be a feeble person in our mid in the next five five minutes there'll be nobody Desiring the Holy Ghost but would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed now there is where the battle begins right in your mind whether you will whether you will wow whosoever will let him come is that right so the real your real battle is what your desire is what do you want what are you going to do folks I'm here to tell you I've learned a long time ago not to rely on other people don't go by other people don't let let other people affect you amen you create your world you decide you can never stop circumstances from coming but you can control how you handle your circumstance amen so it's your choice how many believes it's right there that's where the battle begins it's right in your mind right but now remember it's not Christian Science mind over matter because the mind accept life which is the word of God and that life comes down on the inside amen your thought doesn't do it but the word how many knows the channel listen what he says brought into the channel of your thought see it's not just thought as Christian Science makes it M over matter but your mind does accept it it grasps it where what is your mind controlled by your spirit amen your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life amen oh my listen there's only one Avenue that that can come down and that by the way of free moral agency come into that Soul by your thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you say in this mou move and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said it will come to pass you can have what you said you get it there you are that's the Battleground if you'd only get that started first but we get so anxious to see things done we get to anxious to do something for God Amen oh my listen anxious talking about the lady that's fixing the die you're so anxious you want to live she wants to be well others are here wants to be well when we hear about the case of doctor resurrection of the Dead the mighty things God has done and then we get anxious and the thing of it is we try to reach through these senses and grab a hold of something amen how many knows now don't you can't grab things through your senses it has to come a little bit different than that that's right amen listen to this let's talk about that those channels is that right see taste feel hear and smell conscience memory reason affections imagination and so forth how many knows that those are all channels and avenues that the Devil comes and works in that's right I don't know about you but sometimes I hate my feelings don't you hate the way you feel sometimes oh my sometimes your memory man I don't want to remember that no more I don't want to think about that is that right cuz just the wrong memory you just entertain the wrong memory it'll let devil in well I remember what that person well there you go open up the channel right there is your battle how mean your battle my battle is right here it's not off somewhere your biggest battle is ever right here it's rage forever and every one of those things conscience memory reason affection my especially feeling I wrote down here that life is like a Mountain Railroad that song says there's ups and there's Downs there's Rivers there's valleys there's deserts you go to seem to go through Lord I'm supposed to be a Christian but I don't feel like I'm a Christian I don't feel like I got the Holy Ghost huh boy the devil will come right in there and try to get you to disbelief and if he can get you to disbelief he's got you woo Glory what I'm trying to say is all of those Avenues and channels these places where the devil tries to get in that's right he tries to get in as many times many places he can do it brother Braham talked about you know you let somebody hurt you a bruise first of all a bruise on the body he says in the natural and mean a lot of times a cancer will come from a bruise because those cells are bruised he says in the spirit so somebody does you wrong that's a good place for the devil to come in bitterness to come in hatred to come in torment to come in unforgiveness to come in and with that comes worry how many knows even worry is a terrible thing we're not made to worry and fret like my brother said BR cross Bridges before the bridges are ever built we built the bridges in our mind amen and guess what we never do get to that place it never does happen but worry and fret that's all things that the devil casts on us I wrote down here that from 1 to 12 we go to different changes and I know don't know if you've ever watched on two YouTube where these people going in these slingshots right they'll go in these slingshots and in the chair and they're screaming oh no I can't do it and man they they get so freaked out when he goes up they they pass out they wake up and they pass out if they could just get in their mind they're not going to get hurt they're going to be all right but in their mind it's so catastrophic they want off of there get me off of there amen about about like the time I went off Pilot Rock me and my boys were younger and there was people repelling off that rock over there and we were saying yeah boy be nice we could do that sometime yeah we could do that sometime didn't you remember that Caleb now we went over there to him I asked asking me if I could do it boy they got on to me Dad don't you dare but I thought we wanted to do this they put the harness on me I come up back over there right over to the edge and just as I got back there I said is there any way to get back no cuz see when you get around this edge here the hardest part of the whole thing is going over this Edge cuz you got to use the power of all of your leg to go down over and then get your legs against the side once you're on the side you're just dangling but that transition is what's scary and people doing that bungee and all of that it mean it scares the liver out of them man others are over looking over don't bother them a bit they having the time of their life why because in their minds they're saved the others think it's a Calamity to pass out you know that's the way it is a lot of times with God he'll let you go through a great big mountains big changes in your life will freak you out people will pass out that right Bible says not to faint that we faint not why because we don't know sometimes God allows this to happen changes in our life are Avenues where the devil can come in first first 12 years is not so bad but then we go into what they call the terrible teens Ain that right cuz those those are some terrible hours those are some they can be terrible amen if you don't commit your life to God I was around 20 when I committed my life to God and what you become you become most of the time you'll do it but it's age 20 what was it brother baham said by the age of 22 or so amen 90 or 80 90% people or get saved during that time so get saved young people commit your heart to God cuz it's it's terrible you'll become listen this most of the time time by the time you're 20 or 21 you're going to be what you're going to be or you are what you're going to be amen but transitions things that happen feelings get hurt that's a great place for the devil come in if you don't have your feelings in check being done wrong a't that right well he did me wrong she did me wrong that's a great place for the devil to come in we all know that ain't that right brother B said temper breeds temper talk to your wife in the wrong tone see what happens boom just that quick well you this that the other but take B breath temper much harder to stay calm when somebody yells at you or gets hostile that's right and say well I'm sorry I I didn't mean to do that and this that or the other and and bring the situation under control temper brings temper amen defuse a a kind word I think the Bible says turneth away wrath all these different Avenues amen all these different channels these different changes in our life amen teenagers choose what you're going to do where you gonna what who you going to serve in that hour ain't that right then you get married that right life changes when you get married oh yeah responsibilities comes children are born even birth changes your life amen that's right and why you want to keep every one of those places where they're supposed to be all of your channels has to stay purged and protected how many believes that now how many knows that the world doesn't have the Holy Ghost what I call the guard how many believe the Holy Ghost is a guard it guards your heart amen let's look at that here in a minute let's read a little more now listen and if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the Holy Ghost he says that don't even come into memory in other words well you know sister so and so they tried it this one did this that or the other hey watch that memory stuff or that reason Purge it out that don't even don't even let it come into memory don't matter what sister Jones did and what she did it's you and God together nobody else but you too there you are there's your battle brother B says kill him at the beginning stop him right in his tracks in other words when he comes to that door shoot him he's on your property kill him right there why because he wants to try to get his foot in the door how manyan knows I don't care how big your door is I don't care what it is when you crack the door open somebody gets their foot in there it's going to be real hard to shut that door that's right that's what the devil tries to do just like the birds that fly over your head amen they come and they give you trouble blast them out of the sky don't let them have eggs and their babies have another baby and the babies and babies but that's what we do sometime we let our thoughts get Plum away from us they say Spirits travel on Word words is that right I wonder if Spirits don't travel on thoughts too on thoughts I think every one of us could witness man I got to thinking about that and I got an attitude is that right that's right that's just how easy it is and I'm here to tell you that's where your F battle is it's in your mind it's in your heart the greatest battle ever ever thought was in the human mind I'm believes it's important that you protect it when he brings that thought in your mind cast It Out cast out Paul said reasoning amen anything that's contrary to the word cast it out right there kill him at the beginning that's what he said stop him dead in his tracks it ain't how long you can make the war linger stop it right there W aren't we all a lot happier when Temptation comes when the Devil comes and tries to put something on you amen and you thwart it right there and say woo GL God the devil tried to come and rob me of my joy but I'm still happy this morning because I stopped him in his tracks I stopped him right where he came come into my mind got me to think think something I just cast it I went right on this is good I don't care how many times I ate this steak I'm gonna order another one it's still good don't let it linger don't let him come inside of your house and wrestle them in the hallway don't fight him all day I'm wrestling with this I'm no stop him in his track say right there devil you ain't got no place here get out folks when he comes sewing up on your doorstep meet him with a shotgun the word said rebuke him amen and he'll flee from you resist him and he'll flee from you amen if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscience and everything like that thinking about well I might fail it might not be right don't do that at all amen isn't that the truth well I'm believing for my cancer to be healed I'm believing for this but I wonder if I fail don't even think it don't even thinking that at all because you might not say it but if you think it you're going to lean to one or the other ain't that right and most of the time we as humans we're going to lean to well I don't think I got the faith isn't that what we you know I don't know about you but that's what I think a lot of times that's right well I don't think I got the faith there you go don't listen to the devil you throw aside everything and open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails and I can't fail because I'm taking you at your word there's the battle that's the thing that's the real battle what where is the battle the battle amen is between faith and doubt every day in your mind with everything you meet every time your affections tells you something your feeling your memory conscience all of those things that you got to battle amen H I'm going to make a statement you're a battlefield to yourself you're a battlefield of your very own a whole Battlefield is right here is that right it's not my brother not my sister but it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer my brother's not the problem my sister's not the problem my mama's not the problem my daddy's not the problem I'm the problem amen praise the Lord listen so that's right there's your battle that's the thing why would God Almighty remove a man cancer from a woman's breast without a scar and let a child lay there and die no sir listen when God can get a man in his hands uh oh here we go when God can get a man in his hands shall he can get sensus conscience everything cleaned out until he stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke in there woo if you can ever get so surrendered to God and all these channels keep the power keep that that that uh fortification of the Holy Spirit there guarding say no you don't come in here no you don't come in here no you don't come in here ain't that right the devil can't poke in there anywhere he can't get to you how many beli there'll be an invincible Army W I know I know that's an awful big demand that's a lot to chew on to think you can keep all of your feelings in check all of your emotions in check in such a way the devil can't get in there if I was to ask how many's guilty of not being able to control themselves in their feelings sometimes I'll put my foot up that's right amen thanks be for Grace that's why we can always say Lord Jesus and I believe that's why we need this Lord help me don't let my feeling my conscience or or my irritation hello all of those things don't let that make a path for a spirit to get in an attitude to get into me that is unlike Christ and to rob me of my joy that brother bam said is where the Battleground is amen now notice there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there that's right he come around and he'll say well you don't feel any better see your conscience is even gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts Hallelujah you get prayed for today and tomorrow it's worse well I don't guess God answered prayer I think you just lost it yeah you just confessed that uh God didn't answer but you come up and say I'm believing it with all my heart God's word says it I don't care what the symptom is thank you Lord hallelujah watch God siep on the scene God didn't wait he waited until the three Hebrew children were right up there getting to the fire he was waiting until Daniel got thrown over the edge and he showed up got showed up you just get in a real battle and say I'm believing it no matter what amen and I'm praising God for it how many's with me tonight conscience even oh he shouts Hallelujah that outlet blows a whistle wo glory to God the out the outlet F praise the Lord this is the outlet the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name how many's glad for God's Deliverance how many's glad for God's Freedom how many's glad for God's [Applause] forgiveness you can have joy unspeakable and father we can all just get release ourselves like brother Adam said amen and just let go and let God have his way amen you can be you can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost right now amen if you ain't got it say God I believe I'm filled with your spirit you can be forgiven right now you can be delivered right now amen folks I'm not here to give no pep talk I'm not here to just preach a positive Feelgood message I give you the word of God am that's what the word says amen that's what I want praise be to God oh my it shouts out the whistle shouts out glory to God Amen certainly just as clean and clear for the word of God to work through the power of God that's the main thing there's your Battleground your Battle Ground is back here at the beginning in your soul back in your mind that opens it up the mind is the gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit amen before you can take on a devil your mind has to open up to it amen and if he stays out it's because you shut him out say devil you ain't coming on up in here you ain't disturbing this Holy Ghost down in here he's at the Forefront he's the boss amen the mind is the gate listen your mind opens up or accepts the spirit or rejects it you can have little conscience and feelings and Sensations and these things that has nothing to do with it it's just little sensation how many knows brother bam said that if any of those ever uh are contrary to the word cast them out see it's your mind that opens up up one more or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections and when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows out all the rest of the stuff you can take two the Hatfields and The McCoys how many believe the Hatfields and the mo McCoys they could have been best of neighbors the best of friends if they had just open open up their minds to forgiveness ain't that right if they to just open up their minds to forgiveness instead of Revenge you can take the two people of it doesn't matter how bitter how bad how much they hate each other it doesn't matter what it is get him under the blood under the blood I like what brother Braham said about refuge and he says there's only one place that God don't see sin it's under the Refuge of the blood amen when he's under there God don't don't even see you why because you're in Christ and you're covered by the blood amen all right all these things let God have his way listen every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone amen there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir can't battle against it we know it's true and this battle has raged since the Garden of Eden in the human mind amen listen God is training for this great battle in Daniel 12 said there would be a time of trouble such as like never the Earth before and we're living in that time when culture education and things has smothered over the word of God and got into reasonings and so forth the battle is now who will stand Hallelujah the battle is ready to go in she's a ray now look what an opposition we got under who will be like David said you stand and let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies of the Living God I'll go fight him amen God wants men and women this morning who will raise up and say I'll take the Lord at his word No Matter What fail whatever dis that or the other what this one did that has nothing to do with it amen praise the Lord God's Army is moving forward men men of valor of Faith men of power men of understanding they don't have to be smart they don't have to be educated they have to be channels and God takes those little channels amen the great hour of charge is at hand Hallelujah soldier with armors gleaming colors Streaming Faith and doubt is setting yourself in array in this Tabernacle this morning doubt on one side faith on the other soldiers stand at your post of Duty hallelujah our captain the Morning Star leads on he never goes back he don't know the word Retreat he don't have no retreat amen the greatest battle ever fought is going on right now here yes sir between life and death sickness and health faith and doubt between Liberty and bondage the battle is on Shine Your Spirit soldiers polish up the armor God is getting his soldiers ready amen and he anoints his army thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord how many believes you're part of those Soldier you're you're part of that Army let's stand tonight musicians if you'll come I believe I'm looking at those soldiers tonight how many had to fight to be here tonight yeah you know how easy it is well I don't feel like going you know how easy it is just stay home not hard at all no that will give you 100 reasons amen every day is like that how many believe is that tomorrow you have to watch every one of those Avenues the devil tries to get into you got to have the Holy Spirit at that Forefront guarding and keep you fortified behind the word it keeps you protected from all kinds of things how many beli the holy spirit in your heart keeps you protected from all kinds of evil I'd be looking at a bunch of painted T I'd be looking at a bunch of tattooed people mean or a snake wouldn't we all be ain't no telling you know but we get in fortified hid our life is hid from all those things because we're fortified behind the word get out from behind that word once how many knows Eve was fortified behind that word get out from behind that word once boy it's a bad place to be you're wide open I'll tell you this right now sometimes let's just say temper or attitude sometimes that temper or attitude gets on us aren't you glad you don't keep your attitude or your temper or your bed no you get down on your knees and say Lord I fail Lord forgive me and just like that I believe God forgives you that Holy Spirit comes back into your heart amen aren't you glad for it let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you we're so grateful Lord Jesus for your mercy and your grace Lord all the time Lord we've raised our hands and said Lord I've certainly failed there's many times I've let my emotions get the better of me Lord my feelings got to better me my memory got to better me my thoughts got to better me but Lord you always come back and reveal yourself to us and say now you know you shouldn't be like that and then we humble ourselves down and say God forgive me Lord Jesus and tonight father we thank you for this training lesson Lord Jesus of how we can keep the enemy out how that we can kill him in his tracks stop him right where he stands kill him right where he is father if we'll just do this Lord Jesus and father bring every part of our body and our spirit reising all of that into line and keep it in line when we think father of the chaos Lord that we can see in people's lives because they've let their feelings get out of line maybe they got hurt boy they just they left church now where are they at today simply because they let their feelings get out of line and the whole thing becomes chaos when we allow one of these things in our lives to come out of line so we raise our hands and surrenders and say God help each one after tonight to always have the Holy Spirit at the Forefront and no matter how bad the Devil beats on our feelings our emotions how hard he tries to affect us by these things we are guarding it by the Holy Spirit and we're keeping him out and we're keeping that sweetness that gentleness and that meekness Lord Jesus in our hearts at all times father so that as long as you're there and we're doing that your Prophet has taught us in this Army God that he can't never penetrate this armor he can't never get in there to where we are we've got that Shield of Faith up and it absolutely ricochets Every dart the devil throws at us and I pray God tonight that you'd help each one both those that are here and those that are streaming tonight Lord Jesus I ask God after this night Lord Jesus that we would be listening and that we would be seeing the fiery Darks of the enemy ricocheting off of the faith that we have in you when he tries to bring in doubt father into our hearts we stop it by faith and by believing what you have said father we ask God that you keep each member of evening light Tabernacle each one of our brothers and sisters those under the son of my voice Lord keep us protected from the Ws of the devil and help us to stay pure and clean and sweet before you in Jesus name amen and amen how many has faith that that's going to be you that's going to
