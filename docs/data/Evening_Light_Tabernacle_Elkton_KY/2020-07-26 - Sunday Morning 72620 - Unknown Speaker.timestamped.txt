[32:56] okay
[32:57] revival and the importance the
[32:59] importance of revival and what revival
[33:03] does amen
[33:05] amen i truly believe that it is
[33:08] important to stay in revival
[33:11] all right saint john 4
[33:14] and we'll begin with verse 7
[33:17] there cometh a woman of samaria to draw
[33:20] water
[33:22] jesus saith unto her give me to drink
[33:25] for his disciples were gone away into
[33:27] the city to buy me
[33:29] then saith the woman of samaria unto him
[33:31] how is it that thou being a jew
[33:34] asked us to drink of me which enemy
[33:37] woman of samaria but the jews have no
[33:39] dealings with the samaritans and jesus
[33:42] answered and said unto her if thou
[33:44] knewest the gift of god and who it is
[33:46] that saith unto thee give me a drink
[33:49] that would as
[33:51] buddhists have asked of him
[33:53] and he would have given thee
[33:55] living water
[33:57] amen the woman saith unto him sir thou
[34:00] has nothing to draw with
[34:02] and the well is deep from whence
[34:05] then has thou that living water
[34:08] are thou greater than our father jacob
[34:11] which gave us the well and drank thereof
[34:14] himself
[34:15] and his children and his cattle
[34:17] jesus answers and said unto her
[34:20] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[34:22] thirst again
[34:24] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[34:26] i shall give him shall never thirst
[34:29] but the water that i shall give him
[34:30] shall be in him
[34:32] a well of water springing up into
[34:35] everlasting life may god and his
[34:37] blessings to the reading of the word you
[34:38] can be seated this morning
[34:40] amen i think
[34:42] that last verse i wanted to go one more
[34:44] it says the woman said unto him sir give
[34:47] me this water that i thirst not neither
[34:50] come here
[34:51] to draw
[34:53] amen how many knows jesus always had a
[34:55] reason for doing things
[34:58] amen and you know
[35:01] i don't know just what it was but there
[35:03] was a reason for him to be there and to
[35:05] be there and he actually sent his
[35:06] disciples away
[35:08] amen and then this woman came out to
[35:10] drink you know i just thank god that
[35:13] he knows those that are his how many
[35:15] believes that this morning
[35:17] amen how about you this morning how many
[35:20] remembers the time that the lord came
[35:22] your way
[35:26] aren't you glad that the lord came your
[35:28] way amen and stop perhaps and waited and
[35:33] was right there for you amen and spoke
[35:36] to your heart amen
[35:39] amen and i like this you know because we
[35:41] begin to think about revival we know
[35:43] that
[35:44] the bible talks about how the unreadable
[35:46] tells us the story of that spring isn't
[35:49] that right that spring that uh was
[35:51] always bubbling up
[35:53] it was always bubbling up and happy and
[35:56] and the better be asked to spring some
[35:58] questions about why it was always so
[36:01] happy
[36:02] why it always had so much joy
[36:05] you know
[36:06] was it because i come to drink from you
[36:08] or the deer come to drink from
[36:10] you amen
[36:13] now how many remembers brother baby says
[36:15] that the christian we as christians
[36:18] ought to be the happiest people on the
[36:20] face of the earth
[36:22] we ought to have more joy than anybody
[36:25] and i don't know about you but i believe
[36:27] that the things around us the cares of
[36:30] life the you know because somebody knows
[36:33] that the more cares of life that you
[36:35] have the more you have to worry about
[36:38] those things isn't that right
[36:40] and worry will bring depression
[36:43] amen and so we find that those things
[36:46] they don't bring us joy like they're
[36:48] supposed to amen well they're not even
[36:50] supposed to because the lord he is the
[36:53] one that truly brings his joy
[36:55] but the more the more you get weighed
[36:56] down with cares a lot of times the more
[36:59] this unhappy people become
[37:01] they don't have the joy like they should
[37:03] have amen and i don't know about you but
[37:05] i'm sure every one of us here this
[37:06] morning would admit you know
[37:08] that i really could use more of the joy
[37:10] of the lord
[37:12] amen
[37:13] i believe one place uh uh you know and
[37:16] and what was it i've had it wrote down
[37:18] here
[37:21] but i think some of the pre-service
[37:23] music was even went along real well with
[37:25] what we were we were going to speak
[37:27] about amen but so we think about that
[37:29] and how that he's better bam talk about
[37:31] that thing and he says you know it
[37:33] wasn't anything that anybody did or
[37:36] anything from that well but it was
[37:38] something down on the inside that was
[37:40] coming forth
[37:42] praise the lord and jesus promised this
[37:44] woman and he was there and then he
[37:47] specifically asks her for a drink now
[37:50] how many knows jesus was the fountain
[37:54] he had the water
[37:56] amen that you could drink up and never
[37:58] thirst again and not only would you
[38:00] never thirst again but if you drink this
[38:03] water you become the fountain
[38:07] how many believes that you become the
[38:10] fountain this water that you drink will
[38:12] be in you
[38:13] amen a well of water springing up into
[38:16] everlasting life
[38:19] praise the lord how many know blood says
[38:22] that god really hates a powerless church
[38:25] amen it's called dead church he really
[38:27] doesn't like that god doesn't like death
[38:30] i don't think anybody here likes it
[38:33] amen none of us like to be spiritually
[38:36] dead amen we don't like to be naturally
[38:38] there we don't like amen
[38:40] to have things just to become common to
[38:42] us
[38:44] i mean that's what happens a lot of
[38:45] times if people things just become
[38:47] common to people
[38:49] all right so let's just think about this
[38:51] so he says here
[38:52] it'll be a a well of water
[38:55] bringing up into him an everlasting life
[38:59] and i want to i want to take my my theme
[39:02] pretty much my theme quote that brother
[39:04] bannon makes and if you don't mind i
[39:05] want to just read it to you
[39:07] and uh maybe before i even
[39:10] read it
[39:11] i think of this quote brother bam talked
[39:13] about mr reed head i believe it was
[39:15] which was like the head of the main
[39:17] religious realms back then in his time
[39:20] and out of how that mr redhead he got
[39:23] into a conversation i'm not sure if it
[39:25] was on a plane or somewhere along the
[39:27] way and he got into a a conversation
[39:29] with a muhammad
[39:32] and they got to talk about mr that this
[39:34] mo this mo
[39:38] this man he began to ask him and tell
[39:40] him you know you know you your religion
[39:43] believing in the bible and jesus and so
[39:45] forth you know he says you know our
[39:47] founder you know he claimed that we
[39:49] would have joy and we would have
[39:51] resurrection and so forth you know but
[39:52] your founder jesus he claimed that the
[39:55] things that he did you would do also
[39:58] and he said you know
[40:00] he says let me see him do that and then
[40:02] we'll believe that he's actually risen
[40:05] isn't that right so he got into the
[40:07] conversation like that and and attacked
[40:09] the end of the conversation brother man
[40:11] says mr reed had tried to kind of switch
[40:13] it around and brother branham called it
[40:15] a loophole and he was trying to get out
[40:17] of this conversation
[40:19] he was having with this man because he
[40:21] was very smart intellectually and he
[40:24] couldn't he couldn't defeat him and say
[40:26] well we got salvation and we got joy and
[40:28] we got happiness and he the other guy's
[40:30] at the same thing we got all of that
[40:31] also
[40:33] he says well you know he says you know
[40:35] us better scholars have learned that
[40:38] from i suppose you're referring to mark
[40:40] 16. and he says you know yeah that's
[40:42] what i'm referring to as muhammad did
[40:45] and he and and he began to tell them you
[40:47] know that we have learned that you know
[40:50] mark 16 from about the 14th chapter on
[40:53] it's not inspired
[40:58] and so but better than the more he says
[41:00] he didn't he but didn't like that at all
[41:03] he says he should have referred it to
[41:05] somebody that it did have faith to
[41:07] believe that you know and we well of
[41:09] course we know what happened later on we
[41:11] realized that brother branham he ended
[41:13] up going to the sikhs of jains and all
[41:15] of those and he says now i've come and
[41:17] paid respect to y'all will you come to
[41:19] my service and they all said they would
[41:21] we all know what happened there isn't
[41:22] that right that's when thirty thousand
[41:24] mohammed's and all of them guys got
[41:26] converted and so forth but he said
[41:28] talked about mr redhead and how that he
[41:30] says you know we learned that it wasn't
[41:32] inspired from there on east mr that
[41:35] muhammad and said you know what kind of
[41:36] bible do you have
[41:39] because you know
[41:41] if that part is inspired not all of it
[41:43] is inspired what part is inspired and he
[41:46] was really defeated in his conversation
[41:50] now how many knows you can't just take
[41:53] inspiration out of the bible and say
[41:55] this is part isn't good and expect god
[41:58] to bless you
[41:59] you you can expect defeat when you begin
[42:02] to changing the word of god god put it
[42:06] in there ain't no man got the right to
[42:08] take it out
[42:09] how many please say ain't nobody got a
[42:11] right to say this is inspiring this is
[42:13] in this part the bible says all
[42:15] scripture is given by
[42:18] inspiration of god and he's profitable
[42:21] doctrine for reproof for instruction in
[42:23] righteousness that the man of god may be
[42:25] thoroughly furnished isn't that right so
[42:27] that's what the scripture says and so
[42:29] but he says that and then says what a
[42:31] defeat that it was and then he makes the
[42:33] statement again i believe that all of
[42:36] this is
[42:38] inspired
[42:40] how many beings did every word of this
[42:42] is inspired
[42:46] amen
[42:47] and i want to say this morning i truly
[42:49] believe that we need that inspiration to
[42:52] strike us
[42:54] that's the most needed thing in the
[42:56] message today is for this word that we
[42:59] have to strike is and for it to be amen
[43:02] inspiration to come into here because
[43:04] it's a seed form but the water has to
[43:07] fall and quicken that seed isn't that
[43:09] right
[43:10] so the story goes like this brother bam
[43:12] says i remember standing up there it was
[43:14] by lake michigan and i was just a boy
[43:17] preacher i went up to hear paul raider
[43:20] amen to preach at the world's fair i'd
[43:22] like to hear paul wouldn't you
[43:24] about 1933 i believe it was and it was
[43:27] at chicago and i had my first
[43:29] opportunity to walk out there and look
[43:31] at a large body of water
[43:33] oh mine
[43:35] and uh and it was just a jumping and
[43:37] going on you know and it was early
[43:39] spring easter sunrise service we were
[43:42] there and i see those great big white
[43:45] caps coming in
[43:46] you know and they hit the bank and
[43:48] they'd roll out and i thought oh my
[43:51] floods of joy
[43:52] or my soul like see below's role
[43:56] amen how many has had that experience
[43:59] sometimes you know it doesn't matter
[44:00] where you might be when you begin to
[44:02] think about the lord and the lord begins
[44:04] to let that spring come forth i mean
[44:07] it's like floods of
[44:08] joy
[44:09] amen flood your soul like a sea bellow
[44:12] it becomes rolling and rolling and
[44:16] rolling in
[44:18] amen how many needs more of that
[44:21] and i thought they roll in
[44:23] but that's not the end of the wave it
[44:25] goes back to roll again and i thought
[44:28] what's it all jumping about and
[44:30] something just seemed to say to me it's
[44:32] having a revival that's all
[44:36] well i thought you know what
[44:38] he said there's not one speck not one
[44:41] more drop of water in that place in that
[44:44] lake
[44:45] he says it than it was when it was
[44:47] perfectly quiet
[44:50] he says there's no more water not a bit
[44:54] amen did you ever think of it but it was
[44:57] just having revival just jumping
[44:59] screaming shouting having a revival and
[45:02] i thought well what's the use of having
[45:04] a revival
[45:07] now i read another place and i was
[45:08] listening to
[45:09] several different messages brother bam
[45:11] talked about he says you know it's not
[45:12] in my ability it's not in the preacher's
[45:14] ability or in a person's ability to
[45:17] produce a revival
[45:19] that has to come sovereignly by god but
[45:23] the only thing you can do is get in the
[45:25] place that god can use you to bring a
[45:28] revival
[45:30] amen how many you see you know there's a
[45:32] lot of people think well i sure wish my
[45:34] church had a we sure need a revival no
[45:37] maybe you need a revival
[45:40] let the revival start in you
[45:44] how many would say that this morning
[45:46] lord start a revival in may
[45:50] now sorry to say but most of the time
[45:52] because i believe that as a christian if
[45:54] you're staying tuned up the way that you
[45:56] should stay tuned up with the lord you
[45:59] are in a constant revival how many wants
[46:02] to be there
[46:03] but i'll tell you right now you know
[46:05] sometimes we get backslid a little bit
[46:08] amen into revival kind of he begins to
[46:10] dim out in that right
[46:12] and we that's why it's called the
[46:13] revival because you want to revive what
[46:15] you have already
[46:17] that's what revival is it's something
[46:19] that you have already but it just needs
[46:22] stirred up
[46:24] it needs revive bring back to life
[46:28] amen
[46:29] and i believe that's what people around
[46:31] the message need today is they need to
[46:34] have it revived to bring it back forth
[46:36] back to where it was before
[46:39] all right so now notice let me just get
[46:41] down here to our punch line here
[46:43] what's the use of having the revival oh
[46:46] my he says there's a wind that came down
[46:50] how many believe that's what needs to
[46:52] happen a wind needs to come down
[46:55] something needs to happen
[46:57] a rushing wind you know as we believe it
[47:00] and begin to stir it up what's it
[47:02] stirring it up for
[47:04] and i happen to see that all the trash
[47:06] that was out in the lake it washed up on
[47:09] shore
[47:11] so that's what a revival is for it's to
[47:13] wash out all the trash
[47:18] glory how many beefs that's what the
[47:20] holy ghost does amen when a revival
[47:23] begins to stir in your heart amen all
[47:26] the bad attitudes and all the fussing
[47:30] and all the bickering and all the
[47:32] attitude not all just washes away
[47:35] that's what a stirring in our hearts
[47:37] does you ain't got to worry about the
[47:39] things that are wrong the things that
[47:41] are not good it'll all wash away
[47:44] whenever you have a real revival in
[47:46] christ jesus when the word that we
[47:48] already have
[47:50] amen how many believes that brother bam
[47:52] says you know that that rapture ring
[47:55] faith lays in the message already
[47:59] [Music]
[48:00] it's already there
[48:03] praise the lord
[48:04] and as i got thinking about that this
[48:06] morning i begin to write some things
[48:09] down amen that is in there already
[48:12] we don't need new word
[48:15] huh
[48:17] we don't need another prophet
[48:20] let me say some strong things here is
[48:22] that okay
[48:24] we don't need another prophet
[48:26] i guarantee you if we would need another
[48:29] prophet he'd already been wrote about in
[48:32] the bible
[48:33] and we would have another prophet israel
[48:36] needs another prophet but i believe god
[48:38] is what says that last messenger he has
[48:40] sent that last prophet amen and that's
[48:43] going to have us ready
[48:46] it's what's going to make us ready
[48:48] i want to tell you this morning i
[48:50] believe that the dress is in the closet
[48:53] you just have to go and put it on
[48:56] i think we got what we need we just need
[48:58] to put it on
[49:00] hey man it needs to be a reality in our
[49:03] hearts
[49:04] [Music]
[49:05] and that's where the lack is is people
[49:07] it's not a reality to people
[49:10] this word is not a reality to people
[49:14] amen
[49:15] and what does it do if it's not a
[49:17] reality that means it's dead to you
[49:20] i want it to be alive
[49:22] praise the lord
[49:25] hallelujah
[49:27] all right so we're going to think about
[49:29] that here a little bit more about what
[49:31] all is in there
[49:33] but he says you know it washes out all
[49:35] the trash that's what revival is when he
[49:38] gets stirred up and then it washes all
[49:40] the different things away praise the
[49:42] lord
[49:43] and i got to think one thing you know
[49:45] you know the world you know
[49:47] oh my
[49:49] how many remembers and people are
[49:50] talking about defunding the police right
[49:53] they're talking about defunding the
[49:55] police you know i got a revelation here
[49:57] this week amen brother bannon talk about
[50:00] defunding the police
[50:03] thank you brother steve
[50:05] is that right and he told us how we can
[50:07] do it how many wants to know how we can
[50:09] get rid of all the cops
[50:13] i got a revelation i thought i remember
[50:15] brother brown said you know let
[50:17] everybody
[50:19] try to make jesus their example
[50:22] isn't that right get filled with the
[50:24] holy ghost like jesus was full of the
[50:26] holy ghost and you'll be able to dismiss
[50:28] the police force
[50:31] all right
[50:33] hallelujah i think you'll be able to
[50:34] dismiss the police force
[50:37] you would have to you could get rid of
[50:38] every marriage counselor you wouldn't
[50:40] need them anymore if everybody got
[50:43] killed with the holy ghost amen they're
[50:45] so revival that would break forth until
[50:47] the word of god was so real to them
[50:51] let the water of the holy ghost come
[50:53] down on you this morning and i can tell
[50:55] you man you might be the most stickery
[50:58] person hardest to get along with stick
[51:01] here and stick there but brother brown
[51:02] said let that water come on down
[51:05] let that gosher begin to gush out and
[51:07] undull and those stickers that mean
[51:10] person that you all will make you bloom
[51:13] with like a flower
[51:15] it'll make you soft
[51:17] it'll make you gentle

[59:31] blah blah blah says you know we're
[59:32] expecting god to do something
[59:35] for us we're expecting him to do
[59:37] something first he says women don't be
[59:39] like the world or dress like the world
[59:41] or be like these modern things and all
[59:43] this stuff that they're doing keep away
[59:44] from it you're a daughter of the king
[59:46] and gentlemen you're brethren you don't
[59:48] have to be beat down and pushed off in

[59:53] live a defeated life
[59:56] you don't have to go around with the
[59:57] blues
[59:59] huh you're sons of the king stand up
[1:00:02] with your chest out we're expecting god
[1:00:04] to do something for us and he can't do
[1:00:07] nothing for us when we're just all
[1:00:10] drooping around like something about
[1:00:12] half dead
[1:00:16] lord help thomas father i don't want to
[1:00:17] walk around amen like i'm half dead

[1:00:26] dead things
[1:00:28] we like it alive
[1:00:30] how many thought to be alive and there's
[1:00:33] only one thing that'll ever give you the
[1:00:36] spark of life and that's the power of
[1:00:38] the holy ghost
[1:00:39] jesus christ it's the only spark
[1:00:42] the only thing it'll absolutely get it
[1:00:44] going
[1:00:45] listen to what he says
[1:00:47] now notice he says don't go wrong about

[1:01:20] from you say praise the lord you
[1:01:21] wouldn't last very long
[1:01:24] no they would throw you up because why
[1:01:26] that is not something they like the
[1:01:28] pharisees remember when those people
[1:01:30] were seeing jose
[1:01:33] hosanna
[1:01:34] glory they were worshipping the lord oh
[1:01:38] my brother says wherever jesus is

[1:01:44] people don't even have emotions anymore
[1:01:46] people are so dead they didn't even have
[1:01:48] emotions what did the problem god say
[1:01:49] about emotion
[1:01:52] if your religion doesn't have a little
[1:01:54] emotion in it you ought to bury it
[1:01:57] it's dead you know right
[1:01:59] amen praise the lord and we all how many
[1:02:02] dogs we all express ourselves
[1:02:05] differently
[1:02:06] amen we some of us cry we just i see
[1:02:09] sometimes people just sit there and cry
[1:02:11] and raise their hand
[1:02:13] others are like me and they're loud and
[1:02:15] boisterous and amen their speakers
[1:02:17] should speak out and hallelujah
[1:02:20] amen we can't expect one to be like the
[1:02:22] other but just express yourself to
[1:02:24] almighty god
[1:02:26] praise the lord how many is glad this
[1:02:28] morning amen god wants a lively church
[1:02:32] he wants the members in there to be
[1:02:35] lively stones built up into a house of
[1:02:39] faith
[1:02:41] amen peter he says
[1:02:44] he says in uh
[1:02:45] first peter 2 and 5 he says ye
[1:02:48] also as lively stones
[1:02:52] are built up a spiritual house
[1:02:55] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:02:59] sacrifices acceptable to god by christ
[1:03:03] jesus
[1:03:05] oh if there's anything that we desire
[1:03:07] this morning it's the worship that we do
[1:03:09] bring before the lord that it is
[1:03:11] acceptable when we come on sunday when
[1:03:14] we come on wednesday then our worship is
[1:03:16] acceptable almighty god
[1:03:19] now let me ask you this
[1:03:22] what kind of worship is not accepted
[1:03:25] what kind of worship god don't like
[1:03:30] huh
[1:03:31] well
[1:03:32] it's called
[1:03:34] becoming common
[1:03:36] remember there's a kind of worship that
[1:03:38] you can have there's a kind of things
[1:03:40] that you can offer to god that's a
[1:03:42] stitch in his nose
[1:03:46] your tables have become full of vomit
[1:03:48] and so forth he says you know and
[1:03:50] brother branham he makes the statement
[1:03:52] that they did exactly what they always
[1:03:54] did
[1:03:56] but he says he came to church they
[1:03:58] offered sacrifices they sang songs they
[1:04:01] sang amazing grace perhaps
[1:04:03] but they did it out of tradition
[1:04:09] huh
[1:04:11] that's the kind of worship god doesn't
[1:04:12] accept that's what he doesn't like
[1:04:15] it's just a formal
[1:04:17] common
[1:04:19] thing
[1:04:20] so what does that tell me this morning
[1:04:22] that tells me that when you worship the
[1:04:24] lord it needs to come from your heart
[1:04:30] from way down on the inside
[1:04:32] it reminds me of the story brother damn
[1:04:34] told of a friend of his that was going

[1:12:12] i want to read another scripture
[1:12:15] this water how many beliefs that were
[1:12:16] washed by the water of the word
[1:12:19] you know we're living in the age
[1:12:21] brothers and sisters
[1:12:23] a real
[1:12:25] real
[1:12:27] filthy age
[1:12:28] that right a dirty age
[1:12:38] and i'm sure that every one of us as we
[1:12:40] live here
[1:12:42] that this flesh
[1:12:44] this flesh
[1:12:47] if you aren't careful it wants to take
[1:12:49] on dirt
[1:12:52] this flesh likes the third of the world
[1:12:56] if you just let it go just a little bit
[1:12:58] it isn't long before you get dirt on you

[1:13:12] we'll wash our hair three times a day
[1:13:15] take a shower every day amen to stay
[1:13:17] clean
[1:13:18] and i believe that even in your
[1:13:20] spiritual walk in the hour that you're
[1:13:22] living in you have to be careful to make
[1:13:24] sure that you stay clean
[1:13:27] and we get washed i believe that this
[1:13:30] word
[1:13:31] washes us it makes us clean
[1:13:34] it revives us just as amen that spring
[1:13:38] that's springing up on the spring it
[1:13:39] keeps that spring clean
[1:13:42] you don't see no wiggle tails in that
[1:13:44] cold water no they
[1:13:46] can't stand it in there
[1:13:48] not no real springy water and that's the
[1:13:50] way it has to be in our life in
[1:13:52] ephesians 5 25
[1:13:55] we'll begin with
[1:13:58] um
[1:13:58] verse 25 husbands
[1:14:01] love your wives even as christ also
[1:14:04] loved the church
[1:14:06] and gave himself for it
[1:14:09] praise the lord
[1:14:11] gave himself for it
[1:14:13] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:14:17] with the washing of the water
[1:14:20] by the word
[1:14:22] how many believes that woman
[1:14:24] at the well was filthy
[1:14:28] she was dirty
[1:14:30] having five husbands she had to come out
[1:14:32] there when nobody else came
[1:14:35] because nobody wanted to associate with
[1:14:37] her
[1:14:38] nobody would come out walking with her
[1:14:40] no company you keep you know
[1:14:44] and so she was so dirty that he had to
[1:14:46] be there at a special time
[1:14:49] and what to do when she believed that
[1:14:51] word
[1:14:52] is that right it washed her
[1:14:54] it made her clean
[1:14:58] and that's where it is with you and i
[1:14:59] that's why we love to come to church and
[1:15:01] hear the word because as you receive it
[1:15:04] you see god take that away from me lord
[1:15:06] i know what i ought to be wash it away

[1:15:23] how many thankful for the washing of the
[1:15:25] word

[1:15:29] it don't take long to get all dirty amen
[1:15:33] amen let it wash
[1:15:36] he gave himself forth that he might wash
[1:15:38] it by the washing of the water by
[1:15:41] the word
[1:15:43] amen praise the lord it brings life it
[1:15:46] washes it makes clean

[1:15:53] needed a cleansing they needed the spark
[1:15:55] of the holy ghost
[1:15:57] they need that revival man to wash that
[1:15:59] thing out amen keep it clean that's what
[1:16:02] the church is for this morning that's
[1:16:04] what the word is to do to keep us clean
[1:16:06] praise the lord
[1:16:08] and to give new life
[1:16:10] when you begin to find yourself
[1:16:13] getting kind of cold on god
[1:16:16] find yourself getting a little backslid
[1:16:18] you don't have the joy of the lord you
[1:16:20] don't have a amen anymore a hallelujah
[1:16:23] can't drive down the road and just tears

[1:16:29] is and pray for your brothers and
[1:16:31] sisters amen how many knows that's what
[1:16:33] the holy ghost does
[1:16:34] when you get enough of the holy ghost

[1:16:37] begin to pray for the people you begin
[1:16:39] to pray for your friends and begin to
[1:16:40] reach out and even all of these things
[1:16:42] that's what the word does it brings life
[1:16:44] back into you
[1:16:47] why because listen there's only one kind
[1:16:50] amen that's ordained to be able to do
[1:16:53] that because there's so many that are
[1:16:55] dwindling out
[1:16:58] doesn't bother them a bit never to come
[1:17:00] back to church doesn't bother me a bit
[1:17:03] to just go out there and live like that
[1:17:05] but you know the bible talks about an
[1:17:07] eagle isn't that right how many knows
[1:17:09] the evil

[1:17:23] and they'll get weak they'll get scales
[1:17:26] over their eyes
[1:17:28] they get all hardened and they can't
[1:17:29] hardly catch food anymore
[1:17:32] but you know the bible talks about how

[1:17:45] amen that eventually those scales will
[1:17:47] fall off
[1:17:49] am i right
[1:17:50] and they will renew their youth
[1:17:56] praise the lord how many believes that's
[1:17:58] that's what happens to us as a christian
[1:18:01] oh my i don't care you know
[1:18:03] i love the joy of the lord but think
[1:18:05] about this that 80 year old man brother
[1:18:07] talked about going up there and
[1:18:09] preaching and so forth
[1:18:11] amen he had renewed his youth
[1:18:14] amen in other words you feel strong
[1:18:16] again you feel young again not just
[1:18:19] young and naturally but i'm talking
[1:18:21] about young in the lord amen exuberant
[1:18:24] for god
[1:18:26] an ego has the genetics it has the
[1:18:28] ability
[1:18:30] to renew its youth
[1:18:33] through the eating of the word of god
[1:18:35] amen
[1:18:36] how many islam for that
[1:18:39] would we be if it wasn't for that tell
[1:18:41] me

[1:19:09] always in love with the lord never let
[1:19:11] the thing become cold and old and
[1:19:13] stagnant
[1:19:15] because that's not acceptable to god
[1:19:18] it's a stench in god's nose when it
[1:19:19] becomes common to you lord give us a
[1:19:22] revival how many is with me this morning
[1:19:24] lord give us a revival and he can only
[1:19:27] do that as we surrender ourselves

[1:20:02] living god amen he came forth and he
[1:20:05] says i'll take him on
[1:20:07] he became strong because of the
[1:20:09] revelation that god had given him
[1:20:10] because of the water that flowed through
[1:20:13] if there's ever a time brothers and
[1:20:15] sisters that we need
[1:20:16] that strength it's in this hour
[1:20:19] because this is the age when amen when
