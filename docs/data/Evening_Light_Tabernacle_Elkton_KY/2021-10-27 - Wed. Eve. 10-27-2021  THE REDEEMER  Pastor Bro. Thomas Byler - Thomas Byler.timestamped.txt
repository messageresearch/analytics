[1:17:22] i have blotted out as a thick cloud by
[1:17:26] transgressions and as a cloud thy sins
[1:17:29] return unto me for i have redeemed thee
[1:17:32] sing o e heavens for the lord hath done
[1:17:35] it shout ye lower parts of the earth
[1:17:38] break forth into singing ye mountains o
[1:17:40] forest and every tree therein for the
[1:17:43] lord hath redeemed jacob
[1:17:45] glor glorified himself in israel
[1:17:48] now let's turn over to the book of
[1:17:50] revelations if you would let's go to the
[1:17:52] book of revelations
[1:18:01] revelations
[1:18:03] the
[1:18:04] sixth chapter i believe it is
[1:18:10] or five i believe it is revelations 5.
[1:18:18] and we want to read verse 1 all the way
[1:18:22] through
[1:18:27] 10 and that's on the right hand of him
[1:18:30] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:18:32] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:18:34] seven seals
[1:18:36] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:18:38] with a loud voice
[1:18:40] who is worthy to take to open the book
[1:18:44] and to loose the seals thereof
[1:18:47] and no man in heaven nor in earth nor
[1:18:49] under the earth was able to open the
[1:18:52] book neither to look there on
[1:18:55] and i wept much because no man was found
[1:18:57] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:18:59] neither to look thereon
[1:19:01] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[1:19:04] not
[1:19:05] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:19:08] the root of david
[1:19:10] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[1:19:12] loose the seals thereof
[1:19:15] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:19:17] throne and
[1:19:19] of the four beasts and in the midst of
[1:19:21] the elders stood a lamb
[1:19:24] as it had been slain
[1:19:26] having seven horns and seven eyes
[1:19:29] which are the seven spirits of god sent
[1:19:32] forth into all the earth
[1:19:34] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:19:36] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:19:38] throne
[1:19:39] and when he had taken the book the four
[1:19:41] beasts and the twenty
[1:19:43] four and twenty elders fell down before
[1:19:46] the lamb having every one of them harps
[1:19:48] and golden biles full of voters
[1:19:50] which are the prayers of the saints and
[1:19:52] they sung a new song
[1:19:54] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:19:58] and to open the seals thereof
[1:20:01] for thou was slain
[1:20:03] and has redeemed us to god
[1:20:06] by thy blood out of every kindred tongue
[1:20:09] and people and nation
[1:20:11] and has made us unto our god kings and
[1:20:14] priests and we shall reign on earth
[1:20:18] may god add his blessings to the reading
[1:20:19] of the words you can be seated
[1:20:22] now this is uh one of the greatest
[1:20:25] events
[1:20:27] perhaps since the time of christ
[1:20:29] actually dying on the cross
[1:20:31] amen
[1:20:33] because this
[1:20:34] gives it away of what book this is
[1:20:37] brother bannerman the breach talks about
[1:20:39] this he calls this
[1:20:41] the book of redemption how many
[1:20:44] remembers that many times
[1:20:46] he calls this book his seventh sealed
[1:20:48] book the book of redemption amen
[1:20:52] this whole this whole thing that the
[1:20:55] whole bible the whole thing is a book
[1:20:57] how many believes that this this this
[1:20:59] bible even is a book of redemption
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:05] now
[1:21:07] let me see i'm going to read you a
[1:21:09] couple things about the meaning of
[1:21:12] uh redeem what it means to redeem
[1:21:15] because we know that as god he is our
[1:21:18] redeemer amen i like that because
[1:21:21] the the verse nine i really like because
[1:21:24] they said they sang a new song and
[1:21:26] saying thou art the reason that he was
[1:21:28] worthy to take that book was because
[1:21:32] he had redeemed no no no the first one
[1:21:36] was because
[1:21:38] for thou was slain right so the first
[1:21:41] point was that he had paid the price
[1:21:44] right
[1:21:45] he had actually paid the price
[1:21:47] amen to be able to touch that book
[1:21:51] no isaiah no david no
[1:21:53] solomon it doesn't matter elijah of the
[1:21:56] old testament john the baptist the new
[1:21:58] it didn't matter who it was it wasn't
[1:22:01] the prophet great enough there was not a
[1:22:03] man or a human being great enough
[1:22:07] to be able to look upon even right and
[1:22:11] then in verse 4 it says that john the
[1:22:13] revelator wept much
[1:22:15] because no man was found to open
[1:22:19] or to even read of the book neither to
[1:22:21] look there on
[1:22:23] so we realized john realized that if
[1:22:26] nobody was worthy to touch that book or
[1:22:29] to take that book
[1:22:30] all of creation all of humanity was lost
[1:22:35] isn't that right
[1:22:36] everything was lost if somebody can't
[1:22:38] take this book
[1:22:40] amen
[1:22:41] so we call this a book of redemption
[1:22:44] because that's really what it is that's
[1:22:46] what christ
[1:22:48] my redeemer died on the cross as the
[1:22:51] song says isn't that right
[1:22:53] amen
[1:22:54] paid all are due amen
[1:22:57] amen so we know that he was worthy amen
[1:23:00] over in uh
[1:23:03] in revelations 13th chapter and verse 8
[1:23:06] it says and all that dwell upon the
[1:23:09] earth shall worship
[1:23:11] him
[1:23:12] whose names are not written in the book
[1:23:15] of life of the lamb slain from the
[1:23:17] foundation of the world amen
[1:23:20] so we find a group of people that has
[1:23:22] their names in this book
[1:23:25] how many believe that you have to have
[1:23:26] your name in that book
[1:23:29] now we are taught know that there's a
[1:23:31] song that talks about there's another
[1:23:33] name that was written down last night
[1:23:35] because somebody came to the altar amen
[1:23:37] and they gave their heart to the lord so
[1:23:39] now there's a new name written in heaven
[1:23:43] and the prophet taught no that's not
[1:23:44] when the names are written
[1:23:46] it wasn't last night the night before if
[1:23:49] your name ever was written on there it
[1:23:51] was written there before the foundation
[1:23:53] of the world
[1:23:56] amen
[1:23:57] i'm here to tell you i'm telling you
[1:23:59] right now the people in the church world
[1:24:01] and the religious realm amen it doesn't
[1:24:04] matter you have to fit your mind
[1:24:07] to the word of god and the way that god
[1:24:09] thinks not the way that you want to make
[1:24:10] it fit
[1:24:12] amen and you've got to realize that god
[1:24:15] wrote the book of revelations 2 000
[1:24:17] years ago he told us exactly how it
[1:24:20] would go what everything all the
[1:24:21] different things that would happen he
[1:24:23] talks about what it's going to be like
[1:24:25] in the millennium he talked about the
[1:24:26] new heavens and the new earth on the
[1:24:28] other side of the thousand years
[1:24:31] then the devil will be loosed yet
[1:24:33] foreseen it's because god knows
[1:24:35] everything people don't realize god
[1:24:37] knows everything
[1:24:39] he he's omniscient he al all knowing
[1:24:42] which we can't comprehend but he is and
[1:24:45] he wrote those names down amen in one of
[1:24:47] these days we're told that that last one
[1:24:51] is that last name is gonna come and be
[1:24:54] redeemed right and then in other words
[1:24:57] it's going to come to the saving grace
[1:24:59] of almighty god and when that last one
[1:25:01] comes in it's all over them there's not
[1:25:04] one more going to come in
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:12] so we want to look at this
[1:25:15] you know and i just want to say this
[1:25:16] when you talk about redemption i wanted
[1:25:19] to talk to you about the meaning of
[1:25:20] redemption and i looked this up took me
[1:25:22] just a few minutes to to come in which i
[1:25:24] like to take what the prophet of god
[1:25:26] said about what redeemed means
[1:25:28] all right
[1:25:30] now notice
[1:25:31] the brother of god says now listen
[1:25:34] he says uh
[1:25:35] he says if you've got if you ever got
[1:25:37] eternal life you were part of god's
[1:25:40] attributes part of his thinking because
[1:25:42] you've got eternal life jesus came as a
[1:25:45] redeemer
[1:25:46] and to redeem means to bring it back
[1:25:50] to where it once was or to where it
[1:25:52] started at
[1:25:54] amen so when we think about anything
[1:25:56] that is brought back
[1:25:58] from a state perhaps to where it was at
[1:26:00] one time in that right many times we
[1:26:03] talk about it brings in it brings in
[1:26:06] restoration right
[1:26:09] it means we find restoration in it
[1:26:11] because amen it's fallen from what it
[1:26:13] once was
[1:26:15] amen and we all know that that's exactly
[1:26:17] what the sons and daughters of god
[1:26:20] amen god had an intent god had a thought
[1:26:23] for his sons and daughters of god but
[1:26:25] because of the fall
[1:26:27] right
[1:26:28] amen we were lost we become completely
[1:26:31] lost sons and daughters of god that were
[1:26:33] completely lost and he had to come and
[1:26:35] find us
[1:26:36] and bring us back to himself again
[1:26:40] amen so there's uh there's there's
[1:26:42] restoration he meant to restore
[1:26:44] something you take a car you see
[1:26:47] anything like that you know it was once
[1:26:48] beautiful and so forth and what will
[1:26:50] they do they will restore back to its
[1:26:52] original condition
[1:26:54] and that's what christ is in the
[1:26:56] business of restoration that's just one
[1:26:59] thing and we want to maybe touch on and
[1:27:03] and then also i'll just
[1:27:05] mention a few because i'm just going to
[1:27:07] follow the leading on which one of these
[1:27:09] takes them to go with because amen we
[1:27:11] could preach all night on just
[1:27:12] restoration
[1:27:14] amen how many knows we're going back to
[1:27:17] the garden of eden again god is
[1:27:19] restoring us taking us back to the
[1:27:21] garden of eden again to where we were
[1:27:24] one place one time we were there adam
[1:27:26] was there
[1:27:28] and man we were supposed to be on there
[1:27:30] and continue on but we lost our way so
[1:27:33] to speak because of what adam did amen
[1:27:35] and then
[1:27:36] uh we think about that savior being
[1:27:39] being saved is part of uh uh redemption
[1:27:43] i mean believes that
[1:27:45] the greatest song of all i believe it's
[1:27:48] amazing grace how sweet i once was lost
[1:27:52] but now i'm restored back again i've
[1:27:54] been redeemed i've been brought back
[1:27:56] again now
[1:27:57] god has redeemed me back again
[1:28:00] oh my
[1:28:02] y'all's held onto your seats now don't
[1:28:04] get too happy about that
[1:28:07] but isn't that the truth though when you
[1:28:09] think about
[1:28:10] amen one time you don't you didn't know
[1:28:13] what it was like to have peace and joy
[1:28:15] you didn't know what it was like to have
[1:28:17] forgiveness of your sins and to know
[1:28:19] that you don't have to go to judgment
[1:28:22] anymore you don't have to worry about
[1:28:23] the white throne judgment and have
[1:28:25] everything that you ever did to come up
[1:28:27] before you and having to answer for all
[1:28:29] of that and the fear the scare of it all
[1:28:34] amen now you've been already you're
[1:28:37] already justified now you've already
[1:28:39] amen that's all taken care of for you
[1:28:44] aren't you glad for that
[1:28:45] why
[1:28:47] oh when i think about this
[1:28:49] it encumbers so much
[1:28:52] it actually even
[1:28:54] encumbers resurrection
[1:28:58] even resurrection how in the world is
[1:29:00] redemption
[1:29:01] has to do with resurrection well the
[1:29:03] prophet taught us that you know
[1:29:06] resurrection is not to pick something
[1:29:08] else up resurrection is when you drop
[1:29:11] something
[1:29:12] all right it's to pick that very same
[1:29:14] thing right back up again
[1:29:16] what goes on that's the resurrect
[1:29:18] something that's a it means something
[1:29:20] that's fallen it comes and brings it
[1:29:21] back again right to the same place again
[1:29:25] amen so even our natural bodies if you
[1:29:27] go by the weight of grave man how many
[1:29:29] knows god will restore that he'll bring
[1:29:31] it back and redeem it back to itself the
[1:29:33] way it's supposed to be
[1:29:35] amen
[1:29:37] no there's just so much
[1:29:39] there's reconciliation there's
[1:29:42] deliverance
[1:29:44] right this is deliverance
[1:29:47] at one time you were a captive you were
[1:29:50] a slave
[1:29:52] you ended up on shop the devil had
[1:29:54] rights from you for you and so forth
[1:29:57] because at one time the devil didn't
[1:29:59] have no rights without him no rights he
[1:30:01] couldn't touch him
[1:30:03] but he
[1:30:04] not the devil but we know that adam sold
[1:30:07] us off into the pawnshop we couldn't we
[1:30:09] couldn't overcome we couldn't get off
[1:30:11] the shelf if we tried
[1:30:14] but now god paid the price he picks us
[1:30:17] back up and he restores us again redeems
[1:30:20] us back to himself again
[1:30:22] praise be to god
[1:30:25] all right
[1:30:26] now
[1:30:27] think about that
[1:30:31] oh
[1:30:32] my let me just tell you a little story
[1:30:35] of how the prophet put it
[1:30:37] now we wonder why the revival is not
[1:30:38] going on right now
[1:30:41] you know
[1:30:43] we we we we as folks we we have no
[1:30:46] idea we have no idea what revival really
[1:30:49] is
[1:30:52] how many knows back in the 40s and the
[1:30:54] 50s and the 60s when billy graham all
[1:30:57] robbers tommy hicks all of these you
[1:30:58] know if you could come out here and put
[1:31:01] a tent up
[1:31:02] and hold a thousand people a thousand
[1:31:04] people would come
[1:31:06] go up put it up there now
[1:31:08] it's just your church
[1:31:10] stragglers he's all you did
[1:31:13] you know but back then it was revival
[1:31:15] folks somebody else they had to review
[1:31:16] what's going on
[1:31:18] but even at the end of brother brennan's
[1:31:20] ministry we know it got soda where
[1:31:22] people were so starchy and he was
[1:31:23] starting to settle down and and he
[1:31:25] talked about fight revivals and so forth
[1:31:27] brother bam says you ain't gonna have no
[1:31:29] more i say it in the name of the lord
[1:31:31] you're never going to have those type of
[1:31:32] right those are over with now
[1:31:34] and here he's beginning to talk about
[1:31:36] this why don't we have these revivals
[1:31:37] and what's going on now and listen to
[1:31:39] what what he kind of has in his mind of
[1:31:42] how it works and i like it why there's
[1:31:44] not a revival going on why don't we see
[1:31:46] the enthusiasm with the people i don't
[1:31:49] know why but let's just think what if
[1:31:51] it's like this
[1:31:53] maybe there's a little boy in here
[1:31:54] tonight or a little girl was just born
[1:31:56] over in seattle amen we might say
[1:31:59] hopkinsville or this that the other or
[1:32:01] whatever you might say there's just
[1:32:02] somebody young yet right
[1:32:04] and and that book holds her name
[1:32:08] huh
[1:32:08] a little girl there's you know there's
[1:32:10] that name there and he come to redeem
[1:32:13] whose names was on that book
[1:32:17] how many know that's what he come for
[1:32:19] that's what christ went to calvary for
[1:32:22] was to redeem
[1:32:24] those names
[1:32:30] again he says me and uh redeemed means
[1:32:33] to bring back from where it fell from
[1:32:36] amen
[1:32:37] and in the human race she was fallen and
[1:32:40] she can't accept it right now she's too
[1:32:42] young
[1:32:43] so the church will just slug right along
[1:32:49] it'll just seem hum drum and kind of dry
[1:32:52] this out of the
[1:32:58] that last person is brought in then the
[1:33:01] book is closed
[1:33:03] in other words god's gonna keep things
[1:33:06] going until that last book
[1:33:09] i can't help but believe that's what
[1:33:11] we're doing we're just keeping on
[1:33:13] keeping on keeping on
[1:33:15] until that last one comes in
[1:33:18] and becomes redeemed
[1:33:23] folks help me know you you couldn't blow
[1:33:25] us up you couldn't kill that child you
[1:33:27] could have all the car wrecks
[1:33:32] she could be in car wrecks and the only
[1:33:34] one that lives she could be in a train
[1:33:35] wreck the only one to live but god is
[1:33:37] not going to lose one of his children
[1:33:42] you wonder why people got bubbles around
[1:33:44] them
[1:33:45] you wonder why people can get uh you
[1:33:47] know and get so close to that but they
[1:33:48] still live or they can walk away
[1:33:50] unscathed
[1:33:52] it's all in god's hands folks
[1:33:54] even when you were a sinner if you were
[1:33:57] god's child god was watching over you
[1:34:04] praise the lord i'd have died many times
[1:34:06] brother us we've died plenty times
[1:34:11] some of us out there that's right if it
[1:34:12] wouldn't have
[1:34:14] been for god watching over us
[1:34:18] amen
[1:34:20] oh my thank god for his grace
[1:34:24] amen aren't you glad for this great
[1:34:26] redeemer or the person that kind of he
[1:34:28] brings things back he restores
[1:34:33] he takes us out of captivity
[1:34:36] and restores again to freedom
[1:34:40] folks you can be all stiff and starch
[1:34:42] and lukewarm tonight god can restore you
[1:34:45] he can bring you back
[1:34:47] to enjoy the same
[1:34:50] joy that you had at the beginning like
[1:34:52] david said lord restore unto me
[1:34:55] the joy of my salvation
[1:34:59] because that's what god does say samson
[1:35:02] wasn't a samson that as his hair grew
[1:35:05] back he no not pray god i need a little
[1:35:07] redemption here
[1:35:09] huh i've gotten myself in a terrible
[1:35:12] place but i'd like to be back like i
[1:35:14] once was and god granted him his desire
[1:35:17] and redeemed his strength back to him
[1:35:20] and he did one more mighty thing before
[1:35:22] he passed away
[1:35:24] amen
[1:35:28] a mighty redeemer
[1:35:30] these people were glad they were happy
[1:35:33] they sang a new song said you're worthy
[1:35:36] huh
[1:35:38] there ain't nobody no they know muhammad
[1:35:41] ain't nobody worthy
[1:35:46] amen only one person is worthy and that
[1:35:50] is the lord jesus christ
[1:35:52] why do you think whatever you do in
[1:35:54] wording do you do all in the name of the
[1:35:56] lord jesus christ
[1:35:59] oh my
[1:36:02] you know what's pathetic
[1:36:04] some churches if you don't baptize in
[1:36:06] the titles of the name
[1:36:08] they get upset with you they'll get mad
[1:36:10] because
[1:36:11] because you baptized in the name of the
[1:36:12] lord jesus christ
[1:36:15] what kind of pathetic is that
[1:36:17] he's the one that died for you
[1:36:20] there's no other name given under heaven
[1:36:21] more by you must be saved
[1:36:24] the highest name that there is why
[1:36:26] wouldn't you want to go ahead and
[1:36:27] baptize in the highest name there is
[1:36:30] amen i'll let me tell you why
[1:36:33] because people have a false doctrine
[1:36:35] spirit on them
[1:36:37] that's the only reason why they get mad
[1:36:39] because you're right and they want to be
[1:36:40] right
[1:36:41] i don't care whether uh you know i i
[1:36:44] don't you know i don't care if i'm wrong
[1:36:46] you know as far as fighting for it i
[1:36:48] want to be right right why don't they
[1:36:50] say well i don't care you know whether
[1:36:51] i'm right or wrong all i want is really
[1:36:53] be right but they got this spirit on
[1:36:55] them well i'm wrong and that's what i
[1:36:58] want to be
[1:36:59] you know no
[1:37:01] it's terrible it's a bad spirit
[1:37:04] all right now i know this so how many is
[1:37:07] glad for this
[1:37:09] now let's just look at this for a few
[1:37:11] minutes
[1:37:13] over in
[1:37:14] over in
[1:37:15] leviticus first of all
[1:37:18] now we read here that if if this if this
[1:37:21] jesus that was slain did a work of
[1:37:25] redemption
[1:37:26] it has to be according to god's law
[1:37:29] not just anybody can redeem you
[1:37:32] right
[1:37:34] in leviticus 25 i'll tell you what kind
[1:37:38] of a person it has to be in order to
[1:37:40] redeem you
[1:37:41] and if they so verse 47 leviticus 40 25
[1:37:46] verse
[1:37:46] 47 if a sojourner now he talks about how
[1:37:50] that you know
[1:37:52] how they could become and sell
[1:37:54] themselves to their brothers and their
[1:37:56] sisters
[1:37:57] and it says you know that they are not
[1:37:58] to rule over each other verse 46 with
[1:38:01] vigor but if a sojourner or perhaps a
[1:38:04] stranger comes around
[1:38:06] or stranger it says wax rich by thee and
[1:38:09] thy brother that dwelleth by him wax
[1:38:12] poor
[1:38:13] and your brother sells himself unto the
[1:38:15] stranger or sojourner by thee or to the
[1:38:19] stock of the stranger's family now i
[1:38:22] think what i see in this picture is adam
[1:38:25] selling us out to the devil
[1:38:29] don't you
[1:38:30] a stranger
[1:38:32] right not even family
[1:38:35] all right
[1:38:36] after that he is sold he may redeem be
[1:38:40] redeemed again
[1:38:43] one of his brothers he says may redeem
[1:38:46] him
[1:38:47] either his uncle or his son
[1:38:50] may redeem him or any that is nigh of
[1:38:53] kin unto him
[1:38:56] of his family may redeem him
[1:38:58] or if he be not or if he be able he can
[1:39:01] redeem himself
[1:39:03] amen let me know can you imagine that
[1:39:06] that's hardly going to happen though
[1:39:08] isn't it when you're broke you're so
[1:39:10] broke that you had to sell yourself in
[1:39:11] the first place you probably won't be
[1:39:13] able to redeem yourself that's kind of
[1:39:15] condition that we were in amen there
[1:39:17] ain't no way for us to redeem ourselves
[1:39:19] we could not redeem ourselves no man
[1:39:21] could redeem us why because god demanded
[1:39:24] amen first of all that that redemption
[1:39:26] is perfect amen
[1:39:28] amen and it has to be a person that is
[1:39:30] of the night nearest kin and we know
[1:39:32] that god had to become kin to you and i
[1:39:35] that's why he had to become humanity he
[1:39:37] couldn't do it as an angel he had to
[1:39:39] walk like you walk talk like you up have
[1:39:42] the same temptations like you do
[1:39:45] but how many knows if this land that was
[1:39:46] slim it had to be without blemish it
[1:39:49] couldn't be sinful ain't no man that
[1:39:51] could redeem your soul we couldn't buy
[1:39:53] ourselves back and get right with god
[1:39:55] again because of our sinful condition
[1:39:58] and jesus christ comes along amen and he
[1:40:00] was the only one that was absolutely
[1:40:02] without spot without wrinkle and the
[1:40:05] only one that was able
[1:40:08] and that's why john he first of all wept
[1:40:11] right
[1:40:12] he wept because no man was worthy
[1:40:15] amen to take the book
[1:40:17] nobody was
[1:40:19] had the ability to do it but jesus
[1:40:21] christ did
[1:40:23] when i began to think about this message
[1:40:26] i began to think about how that really
[1:40:29] when you talk about redemption
[1:40:31] you talk about one of the main aspects
[1:40:34] of the whole plan of god
[1:40:39] amen
[1:40:41] it wasn't until i come into the message
[1:40:43] that i was told
[1:40:46] that
[1:40:47] god
[1:40:49] actually created eve
[1:40:52] in such a way
[1:40:54] huh
[1:40:56] that she would fall
[1:40:59] that she would fall
[1:41:02] that's pretty hip
[1:41:06] you know
[1:41:07] but you know you might say well that's a
[1:41:09] little hard for me to swallow
[1:41:12] but do you realize that he put eve on
[1:41:15] free moral agency didn't he just like he
[1:41:18] did the angels that were in heaven that
[1:41:20] he created
[1:41:22] that's something else i didn't know
[1:41:24] that they would put on free moral agency
[1:41:27] they could choose
[1:41:29] because how many knows if you wasn't if
[1:41:32] you wasn't put on free moral agency
[1:41:34] you would do exactly whatever god put in
[1:41:36] there for you to do
[1:41:39] you wouldn't mess up
[1:41:42] you wouldn't mess up
[1:41:44] but he puts it on you and a third of the
[1:41:48] angels of heaven
[1:41:50] made the wrong choice
[1:41:53] decided with the devil
[1:41:56] isn't that right the bible says a third
[1:41:58] of them and god kicked them out of
[1:42:00] heaven the first battle that there ever
[1:42:01] was was in heaven isn't that right
[1:42:04] that's right
[1:42:08] amen and he kicked them out they come
[1:42:09] down on the earth and all those angels
[1:42:11] now are influencing people they
[1:42:13] influence eve eve would put on free
[1:42:15] moral agency god knew what she would do
[1:42:19] before he ever took her out of the ring
[1:42:24] and she made the choice
[1:42:26] she was deceived she listened too much
[1:42:29] how many knows you can listen to the
[1:42:31] wrong thing too much
[1:42:32] until you become convinced
[1:42:37] because adam
[1:42:40] it talks about adam was not deceived he
[1:42:42] willfully walked out to save his wife
[1:42:45] he knew what he was doing he knew he
[1:42:46] wasn't supposed to but he wasn't didn't
[1:42:48] want to let eve go
[1:42:50] so he willfully walked out and sold us
[1:42:52] out
[1:42:52] because of her love his love for her
[1:42:55] amen
[1:42:58] but anyway so think about it and of
[1:43:00] course we realized and i said that to
[1:43:02] say this
[1:43:04] that god knew it and there was never
[1:43:07] going to be no fall unless he makes a
[1:43:09] channel for it and he knew exactly what
[1:43:11] it would be and that humanity would go
[1:43:13] in the direction that it would go that
[1:43:15] you and i would be here that man would
[1:43:17] go and i'll tell you what sons and
[1:43:19] daughters of god would be scattered
[1:43:21] through all the earth and oh my
[1:43:23] everything that would happen he knew it
[1:43:25] all
[1:43:27] but you know god wanted to express
[1:43:30] himself because in him was to be a dad
[1:43:34] in him was to have a son
[1:43:37] to have children sons and daughters
[1:43:40] that's when the prophet comes along and
[1:43:42] he says you know you are also a part of
[1:43:46] the attributes of god if you are not
[1:43:49] part of an attribute of god you never
[1:43:51] will be a part of him ain't no way
[1:43:53] you'll ever be in heaven if you're not
[1:43:55] an attribute or part of god and his plan
[1:43:58] and his thinking
[1:44:00] amen
[1:44:02] oh my that's why the believer
[1:44:05] should have so much joy
[1:44:08] amen
[1:44:10] that's why the unbeliever should be so
[1:44:11] scared
[1:44:13] amen the sinner should be so scared god
[1:44:17] you know am i part of
[1:44:18] him most of the time when there's an
[1:44:21] unbeliever i ain't going to hear that i
[1:44:23] ain't going to listen to that i'm out of
[1:44:25] here
[1:44:26] that's what they do
[1:44:28] they don't give a hug
[1:44:30] but a child of god is lord i want to be
[1:44:32] yours
[1:44:33] lord i want to be yours that's why when
[1:44:35] you make a make a mistake and fall sword
[1:44:38] and everything else it hurts you down
[1:44:39] here because you don't want to
[1:44:42] you want to be right
[1:44:43] you care about whether you plea are
[1:44:45] pleasing to your father amen and you
[1:44:48] want to be a christian and you have a
[1:44:49] desire to do what's right and and to be
[1:44:52] in heaven and so forth that desires
[1:44:54] there
[1:44:55] amen
[1:44:58] and we look because god of course we
[1:45:00] know that he is a father and so forth
[1:45:02] but he cannot never he'll he never he
[1:45:04] never you'd never know what it was like
[1:45:07] you'd never experience him as a redeemer
[1:45:10] unless you fell
[1:45:14] huh
[1:45:17] you'd never know what it's like to get
[1:45:19] away from god and to get a little cold
[1:45:21] and sniff on him and oh become miserable
[1:45:25] right
[1:45:26] amen and then get down on your knees and
[1:45:28] say god i'm miserable i'm not like i
[1:45:30] ought to be restoring me again and god
[1:45:33] restores you brings you back
[1:45:36] you say thank god thank you for your
[1:45:38] grace lord
[1:45:41] amen
[1:45:43] he's our redeemer he's your savior he's
[1:45:46] your deliverer
[1:45:48] amen
[1:45:51] let's turn if you will to the book of
[1:45:55] luke
[1:45:57] look for
[1:46:10] do you all remember one place uh
[1:46:12] i meant to look it up and didn't
[1:46:18] hell i mean jesus christ makes a
[1:46:20] statement somewhere and he says
[1:46:23] because the pharisees kept says we were
[1:46:24] never in bondage
[1:46:27] remember that
[1:46:29] you know they didn't really need jesus
[1:46:31] how many knows that the pharisees they
[1:46:32] didn't really need jesus they didn't
[1:46:34] think they needed him
[1:46:36] jesus makes a statement something to the
[1:46:39] order that they which are whole
[1:46:42] need not a physician
[1:46:44] right that's what's a lot of people's
[1:46:46] attitude they think that they're whole
[1:46:48] they don't need a physician
[1:46:50] but i mean knows that we all need a
[1:46:52] position
[1:46:54] we need the great physician
[1:46:57] amen we needed him more than what we
[1:46:58] realized so luke chapter
[1:47:02] 4
[1:47:06] now notice i want you to see how you can
[1:47:09] see
[1:47:10] deliverance
[1:47:11] restoration
[1:47:13] and redemption
[1:47:14] in this
[1:47:16] verse 17
[1:47:17] and there was delivered on him to him
[1:47:20] the book of the prophet isaiah
[1:47:23] and when he opened the book he found the
[1:47:25] place where it was written
[1:47:27] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:47:29] because he has anointed me
[1:47:31] to preach the gospel
[1:47:33] to the poor
[1:47:35] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:41] once you didn't have a broken heart but
[1:47:43] if you've got a broken heart
[1:47:45] god is here to restore that broken heart
[1:47:48] to bring you back
[1:47:51] right
[1:47:52] to preach deliverance
[1:47:55] at one time you was not needing
[1:47:57] deliverance
[1:47:59] adam didn't need deliverance but after
[1:48:01] we to fall we needed deliverance
[1:48:06] in other words we were free at one time
[1:48:09] and now you're captive
[1:48:11] you need deliverance
[1:48:13] that's what he come for
[1:48:15] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:48:20] the recovering of the sight of the blind
[1:48:23] amen
[1:48:24] and to set at liberty them that are
[1:48:28] bruised
[1:48:30] amen it's all restoration it's always
[1:48:34] bringing back
[1:48:35] from a
[1:48:36] uh from the fallen condition that we
[1:48:39] find ourselves
[1:48:41] praise be to god
[1:48:43] aren't you glad for that
[1:48:45] and just think just think as long as he
[1:48:48] is on that mercy seat
[1:48:50] that's what he's doing every day
[1:48:55] i mean he believes he's still in the
[1:48:57] business of delivering he's still in the
[1:49:00] business of restoring
[1:49:06] god loves to restore
[1:49:09] god loves to deliver
[1:49:11] god loves to heal
[1:49:13] how many knows you get sick
[1:49:16] you need deliverance you need redemption
[1:49:18] you need god to come and restore are you
[1:49:21] back from where you were back to your
[1:49:23] original state folks i could be at home
[1:49:25] right now laying in bed with a fever and
[1:49:28] throwing up in my my garbage can and
[1:49:30] just feeling horrible
[1:49:33] huh
[1:49:35] and laying there and wishing boy i sure
[1:49:37] wish i feel good
[1:49:41] and we'll get to feeling good in a few
[1:49:43] days and feel all good and god did all
[1:49:45] of that
[1:49:47] and then we don't even give him praise
[1:49:49] none and glory
[1:49:51] thank you lord for healing me
[1:49:53] thank you for restoring my health
[1:49:56] thank you for redeeming me from the jaws
[1:49:59] of death
[1:50:01] amen
[1:50:03] oh he's such a great
[1:50:05] redeemer
[1:50:07] to bring us back
[1:50:09] from a fallen place
[1:50:12] amen that's why those all those men sang
[1:50:15] a new song thou art worthy
[1:50:17] because that has redeemed us
[1:50:20] you have brought us back to god
[1:50:23] we were away from god and now we're not
[1:50:25] away from god paul called it the message
[1:50:27] of reconciliation
[1:50:32] to reconcile
[1:50:35] you get in a fight with somebody
[1:50:37] get in the fuss with somebody
[1:50:39] get the fuss with your wife what you
[1:50:41] need
[1:50:42] reconciliation
[1:50:44] that's the way it does with with other
[1:50:46] with us and god we needed reconciliation
[1:50:51] amen
[1:50:53] let's read the scripture on
[1:50:58] ii corinthians 5 and 18 says it this way
[1:51:04] now notice
[1:51:07] and all things are of god who hath
[1:51:10] reconciled us
[1:51:13] to himself by jesus christ
[1:51:16] amen i'm very glad to be brought back
[1:51:19] into fellowship with god how many knows
[1:51:21] that our fellowship was severed from
[1:51:23] almighty god we couldn't have fellowship
[1:51:27] you couldn't sit in a church pew like
[1:51:29] you are now and have the sweetness of
[1:51:32] the holy spirit
[1:51:34] to be able to raise your hands and say
[1:51:36] thank you lord
[1:51:38] you couldn't have him in your heart in
[1:51:39] the old testament
[1:51:41] not until you get the baptism of the
[1:51:43] holy ghost not until you are reconciled
[1:51:46] brought back into fellowship redeemed
[1:51:50] why that's why we sing redeemed how i
[1:51:52] love to proclaim it redeemed by the
[1:51:55] blood of the lamb
[1:51:58] amen regime how many is glad to be
[1:52:00] redeemed
[1:52:02] to be reconciled
[1:52:06] amen
[1:52:09] who has reconciled us unto himself by
[1:52:12] jesus christ and has given us the
[1:52:15] ministry of
[1:52:17] reconciliation
[1:52:19] to it that god was in christ
[1:52:22] reconciling the world to himself
[1:52:25] not in imputing them their trespasses
[1:52:28] unto them and has committed unto us the
[1:52:31] word of reconciliation
[1:52:36] oh hallelujah
[1:52:37] how many is glad for that
[1:52:39] to be reconciled
[1:52:41] praise be to god
[1:52:44] to be brought back
[1:52:48] to back to it's the condition
[1:52:50] that it's supposed to be
[1:52:53] there's only one way there is only one
[1:52:55] thing
[1:52:57] that we are not
[1:52:58] reconciled
[1:53:00] the way that adam was to god
[1:53:05] you ain't heard that before i got your
[1:53:07] attention now don't you you used to say
[1:53:10] that we are completely reconciled to god
[1:53:12] the way that adam was before the fall
[1:53:15] but if i don't if i remember right even
[1:53:17] the prophet made this statement that's
[1:53:18] why i make it
[1:53:20] and that is except for
[1:53:22] this flesh
[1:53:24] huh let me know this flesh has to be
[1:53:27] changed
[1:53:29] amen
[1:53:30] it has to be changed what it was
[1:53:33] before the fall
[1:53:34] then it'll be complete that's why in
[1:53:36] romans 8 i believe it says we who have
[1:53:38] the first fruits of the spirit do grown
[1:53:41] within ourselves waiting to wit the
[1:53:43] redemption
[1:53:44] of this body
[1:53:46] there's one thing left
[1:53:47] the spirit is the soul is the mind is
[1:53:50] the heart is but the flesh is not yet
[1:53:54] amen
[1:53:57] oh my and we're waiting for that paul
[1:53:59] said
[1:54:01] oh my
[1:54:05] let's look at the
[1:54:09] another message of restoration
[1:54:13] to bring back
[1:54:14] how many believes that we are living in
[1:54:17] a
[1:54:18] restored hour
[1:54:22] joe
[1:54:24] in job
[1:54:25] 2
[1:54:27] and 23. and the prophet of god is the
[1:54:29] one that picks this up and he applies it
[1:54:31] to it
[1:54:32] and another scripture that the prophet
[1:54:33] picked up and said there'll
[1:54:35] be a day that will be neither light nor
[1:54:38] dark
[1:54:39] it says but it'll be a dismal day
[1:54:42] and then the next thing that the
[1:54:44] scripture says but in the evening time
[1:54:47] it shall be light amen he applied that
[1:54:50] to our day
[1:54:52] through luther through wesley through
[1:54:53] the dark ages to catholicism
[1:54:56] it wasn't really bright it wasn't dark
[1:54:58] it was a dismal day right
[1:55:01] but here at the evening time all of a
[1:55:03] sudden the sun
[1:55:05] is going to come out
[1:55:07] quiet now how many of the sun came out
[1:55:10] the sun came out and shined beautifully
[1:55:13] and bright
[1:55:17] the bible says in revelations 18 uh and
[1:55:19] you know there's a
[1:55:20] angel that went forth and the whole
[1:55:22] earth was lightened with his glory
[1:55:27] malachi 4 for the power of god and the
[1:55:30] powers and the things that he did
[1:55:32] amen
[1:55:34] it lightened the earth
[1:55:38] you don't think them seeks to change and
[1:55:40] all of those buddhists were i popping
[1:55:42] open when he says you know if your god

[1:55:46] quit talking let's quit passing tracks
[1:55:48] coming open this blind man's eyes i'll

[1:56:02] same way with the sovereignty preachers
[1:56:04] that want to dispute him with the by god
[1:56:06] and the baptism and so forth amen and he
[1:56:08] told them exactly what it would be and
[1:56:10] what it would not be the man came up and
[1:56:11] he said you know you might not agree
[1:56:14] with him but he told me everything would
[1:56:16] happen
[1:56:17] brother ram couldn't see further than
[1:56:19] you and i could see without god coming
[1:56:21] down and giving him his vision of what
[1:56:23] would happen
[1:56:25] that's what visions and dreams just says
[1:56:26] beginning to tap into the
[1:56:28] the eyesight
[1:56:30] the eyeballs of god

[1:56:34] future

[1:57:52] god has brought back he has redeemed us
[1:57:55] back he has brought back the word again
[1:57:58] in our day
[1:58:00] all that the catholics and everybody
[1:58:02] else did of whether it was a godhead
[1:58:05] they've got the three different gods and
[1:58:07] their worship i mean baptizing in titles
[1:58:09] instead of using the name the way they
[1:58:11] were supposed to kissing mary's feet off
[1:58:14] and kissing peter toes off and amen they
[1:58:16] got to trinity god three different gods
[1:58:19] and all kinds of messed up stuff
[1:58:22] they got the kosher bread that if you
[1:58:23] eat that little bread and communion
[1:58:25] that's the literal body of jesus christ
[1:58:27] that ain't the literal body of jesus
[1:58:29] christ
[1:58:30] that's the symbol of his body is that
[1:58:32] right i mean just all kinds of things
[1:58:36] lose to come along west they come along
[1:58:38] and where and where as they come along a
[1:58:40] little more came and a little more come
[1:58:42] right
[1:58:43] but that was reformation getting a
[1:58:44] little more but it just i will restore
[1:58:47] all that that has eaten i will come back
[1:58:50] and i will show you and i'll have you

[1:58:58] we ain't going to put your name on no
[1:58:59] church book evening like tabernacle
[1:59:01] don't have no name for you to put on the
[1:59:03] only way you become a member of this
[1:59:05] body is by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:59:09] by one spirit paul said are we all
[1:59:11] baptized into one body and become
[1:59:13] members in particular of particular in
[1:59:15] him
[1:59:16] it's the only way to come into the body
[1:59:17] we got it straight folks
[1:59:20] how many believes it
[1:59:21] you could come we could have a name we
[1:59:23] can put your name on the book we can
[1:59:25] have a hundred extra names on there that
[1:59:27] probably never make it
[1:59:29] but get your name on that his book
[1:59:31] and then get filled with the holy ghost
[1:59:33] and get into the body of christ and
[1:59:35] you're sealed until the day of your
[1:59:36] redemption
[1:59:38] how many glad amen that god has brought
[1:59:40] us back he's redeemed the word again so
[1:59:42] to speak and honey restored it
[1:59:45] brought it back to its fullness again
[1:59:48] all the years the caterpillar and
[1:59:50] everybody has eaten don't you realize
[1:59:52] during brother bram's time they were
[1:59:54] having bible schools and they were
[1:59:56] pushing them preachers out one after the
[1:59:58] other and they were going home to mama
[1:59:59] that had gotten healed amen and they
[2:00:01] were saying you know mama what are you
[2:00:03] so happy about his mama says because i
[2:00:06] went down to the corner on a little old
[2:00:09] you know a little old church somewhere
[2:00:10] and they prayed for me now i got healed
[2:00:12] praise be to god the boy says you know
[2:00:14] we read in the bible where mark 16 from
[2:00:16] that verse raised until their hands on
[2:00:18] the sickness because that part's not
[2:00:20] even inspired
[2:00:23] huh how many know these bible schools
[2:00:25] were teaching there's no such thing as a
[2:00:27] holy ghost in our day there's no
[2:00:29] miracles and all though
[2:00:31] right in the midst of it god comes and
[2:00:32] proves it all wrong
[2:00:34] back to the story you want me to finish
[2:00:36] the story about the mom
[2:00:38] yeah the moment he said you know and
[2:00:40] then he said to her son her son said you
[2:00:42] know that wasn't even inspiring you mean
[2:00:44] you haven't been down there with them
[2:00:45] holy rollers and then backwash a little
[2:00:47] bit have you
[2:00:48] huh
[2:00:49] he says well i'll tell you what son if
[2:00:52] that's not the inspired word she said
[2:00:54] this she said you know if god can heal
[2:00:56] me with the uninspired word what can we
[2:00:58] do with that which is really inspired
[2:01:03] blurry she got happy
[2:01:07] isn't that right
[2:01:09] how many we've had a restoration
[2:01:12] we have been uh we have something that's
[2:01:14] been bringing us back he redeemed back
[2:01:17] back to the way that de paul taught it
[2:01:19] whether it's a way of salvation
[2:01:21] whether it's the way to come to god
[2:01:24] you must be born again you can't just
[2:01:26] join church
[2:01:28] no it's got to be a real birth
[2:01:31] the whole thing
[2:01:32] praise the lord god is good isn't he
[2:01:36] oh my when i think about it that's right
[2:01:40] there's redemption there's
[2:01:42] restoration
[2:01:44] redemption
[2:01:47] amen
[2:01:49] somebody will do something really bad
[2:01:52] i haven't regida the uh
[2:01:55] series version
[2:01:57] wherever she gets hers from right
[2:02:00] of what uh
[2:02:02] to redeem means
[2:02:05] it says one place
[2:02:08] to atone or make amends for
[2:02:11] error
[2:02:12] or evil
[2:02:13] huh
[2:02:16] can you see the lord in that yeah he
[2:02:18] made an atonement
[2:02:20] for the air and for the evil huh
[2:02:23] another one
[2:02:28] to repay
[2:02:29] a stock ponderings
[2:02:32] instrument at the maturity date well
[2:02:35] anyway i don't understand that one
[2:02:39] he says to pay
[2:02:41] the necessary money
[2:02:43] to clear a net
[2:02:46] i thought that's good
[2:02:48] to pay the necessary money
[2:02:51] to clear that
[2:02:52] amen that's redemption
[2:02:55] that's christ our redeemer
[2:02:59] how many fed for a redeemer
[2:03:01] how many worships him as redeemer
[2:03:04] and this great redeemer his name is the
[2:03:07] lord jesus christ there's no other
[2:03:09] redeemer
[2:03:11] amen
[2:03:12] another one
[2:03:15] all right
[2:03:19] it says to buy
[2:03:21] the freedom of
[2:03:22] or for
[2:03:24] to buy your freedom
[2:03:26] how i'm elise that's what he did
[2:03:28] he bought our
[2:03:31] freedom
[2:03:33] amen
[2:03:34] you love him tonight
[2:03:36] when i think about how in every head
[2:03:39] listen
[2:03:40] he's our redeemer
[2:03:42] in almost every aspect of our life
[2:03:45] i don't believe that
[2:03:46] your healing he redeems you if you get
[2:03:49] sick
[2:03:50] you know
[2:03:51] uh
[2:03:53] just so many things
[2:03:55] you
[2:03:56] you have uh like i said earlier you know
[2:03:59] you have a friendship and that
[2:04:00] friendship falls out
[2:04:04] wouldn't it be something pedophile says
[2:04:05] you know the devil brought them back
[2:04:07] together
[2:04:10] the devil's no redeemer
[2:04:12] he doesn't restore stuff he makes things
[2:04:14] worse
[2:04:15] but christ he brings it back together
[2:04:19] if you'll both get under the blood
[2:04:21] you'll be restored there'll be
[2:04:22] redemption there again
[2:04:24] amen
[2:04:28] think about it
[2:04:29] so many different aspects of our life
[2:04:32] aren't you glad for redemption
[2:04:35] amen we need redemption every day
[2:04:39] things that happen
[2:04:42] amen turn with me in closing i want to
[2:04:44] do one more scripture
[2:04:52] in ephesians.
[2:04:59] ephesians 1 and verse 13 in whom he also
[2:05:03] trusted
[2:05:04] after that you heard the word of truth
[2:05:06] the gospel of your salvation
[2:05:09] amen
[2:05:12] in whom
[2:05:13] also after that ye believed you were
[2:05:17] sealed with that holy spirit
[2:05:20] of promise
[2:05:22] amen i mean please the holy spirit is
[2:05:24] that seal
[2:05:26] and also this holy spirit it says which
[2:05:30] is the earnest of our inheritance
[2:05:35] amen so god gives us the baptism of the
[2:05:38] holy ghost
[2:05:39] because it's the earnest
[2:05:42] of our inheritance
[2:05:44] that's what we possess remember the
[2:05:46] quarter
[2:05:47] or the
[2:05:48] down payment on something
[2:05:51] that's right a down payment of heaven
[2:05:53] how many believes you've got you've got
[2:05:55] the baptism in the holy ghost you've got
[2:05:56] a down payment of heaven
[2:05:58] until you have the earnest of our
[2:06:01] inheritance until
[2:06:03] the redemption
[2:06:05] of the purchase possession
[2:06:08] i like that
[2:06:09] now how many knows what that is that
[2:06:11] right there is referred to many times
[2:06:15] to the resurrection
[2:06:18] right
[2:06:20] until the time of the
[2:06:22] redemption of the purchase procession in
[2:06:25] other words there comes a time
[2:06:27] when he's going to
[2:06:28] gather together all
[2:06:30] that is in christ
[2:06:32] he's going to
[2:06:34] cash in everything that he's bought
[2:06:37] everything that he's purchased
[2:06:39] everything that he has redeemed now he's
[2:06:42] going to redeem everything he has
[2:06:43] redeemed in other words where he's going
[2:06:45] to take it on the heaven because how
[2:06:46] many knows paul can't see christ
[2:06:49] irenaeus the group can't see christ
[2:06:52] martin's
[2:06:54] every all of those saints of all the
[2:06:55] ages there are in their zones so to
[2:06:58] speak under the altar waiting for the
[2:07:01] resurrection when brother bannon went
[2:07:03] beyond the curtain of time and saw
[2:07:05] millions of people
[2:07:07] men and women
[2:07:09] one woman come up there one young
[2:07:11] looking beautiful woman come up there
[2:07:13] past him and
[2:07:14] and the angel said to him don't you
[2:07:16] remember her
[2:07:18] he said i don't remember her
[2:07:21] no and the angel said she was past 90
[2:07:25] when you let her the christ
[2:07:28] and then he was wondering if they're all
[2:07:29] brandons what is know they said that are
[2:07:31] your converse those are the ones you led
[2:07:33] to christ
[2:07:35] brother branham i have a group
[2:07:37] that right
[2:07:38] and he says well i want to see my man i
[2:07:41] want to see my lord
[2:07:42] i want to see jesus he said
[2:07:45] you can't see him yet
[2:07:47] right
[2:07:49] no because when we see him we're all
[2:07:52] going to get the same aren't you glad
[2:07:54] for that when that redemption when the
[2:07:57] time
[2:07:59] comes and he gonna
[2:08:02] actually catch but he has bought he's
[2:08:03] gonna bring it back and then we're gonna
[2:08:05] be with him oh my
[2:08:09] just think of it
[2:08:11] now we know that abraham and isaac and
[2:08:13] jacob and all the old testament
[2:08:16] they went up into another realm also how
[2:08:19] many know it believes they're waiting
[2:08:21] even abel all of them is waiting
[2:08:24] somewhere
[2:08:25] because christ is doing the mediator
[2:08:27] work
[2:08:28] right now when that is over with
[2:08:30] i mean believes that's when we're going
[2:08:31] to crown him king of kings
[2:08:34] and lord of lords and he's not going to
[2:08:36] be in the dispensation of the son
[2:08:38] anymore he's not going to be in the
[2:08:40] dispensation of the holy ghost anymore
[2:08:43] because that's what he's now the pillar
[2:08:45] of fire in each one of our hearts but
[2:08:47] that's when he goes into son of man son
[2:08:50] of god which is the holy ghost
[2:08:51] dispensation and the third one is the
[2:08:53] son of david
[2:08:55] he's going to be king of kings
[2:08:57] and lord of lords
[2:09:01] amen
[2:09:02] why did god allow this
[2:09:04] why did we have to be redeemed back
[2:09:07] god had us in his mind as sons and
[2:09:09] daughters before the foundation of the
[2:09:11] world
[2:09:13] but when we get over there
[2:09:16] and this is just a thought of mine are
[2:09:17] you ready
[2:09:20] what if we'd never fail fallen
[2:09:25] what if we'd have never fallen and
[2:09:26] become sons and daughters of god
[2:09:28] we'd never learn all the things we've
[2:09:30] learned
[2:09:31] we'd have never known god as a redeemer
[2:09:35] as a savior as a deliverer
[2:09:38] and every as a father as a leader as a
[2:09:42] led being led by the spirit isn't that
[2:09:44] right
[2:09:46] we'd have never known him as a comforter
[2:09:49] how many knows when we get over there
[2:09:51] amen we amazing grace house sweet the
[2:09:53] sound that saved the reds like me
[2:09:55] the all the angels will have to be quiet
[2:09:57] circling around the earth they'll all be
[2:09:59] quiet and hang their heads
[2:10:02] they don't know
[2:10:03] amazing grace they don't know
[2:10:06] oh
[2:10:07] what a savior oh
[2:10:10] let's say
[2:10:11] we can say that from the bottom of our
[2:10:14] oh why the savior
[2:10:16] is mine
[2:10:18] wonderful glorious amen
[2:10:22] i mean they're like wow
[2:10:25] amen
[2:10:26] and both have character how many knows
[2:10:29] that that's what god allowed it for so
[2:10:31] when we get over there we're ready to
[2:10:33] rule
[2:10:34] we're ready to be kings and priests
[2:10:37] unto god
[2:10:39] amen
[2:10:41] that's why he allowed it
[2:10:43] because he wants us to be
[2:10:45] just like him
[2:10:49] when evil comes brother brad when evil
[2:10:51] comes in front of you
[2:10:53] huh are we going to do like the angels
[2:10:55] did and side with the devil
[2:10:58] no
[2:11:00] we're gonna chew him get thee behind me
[2:11:02] satan
[2:11:04] and that's this is the training ground
[2:11:05] for that over there
[2:11:07] that was the purpose of it all amen
[2:11:10] and it was a great purpose it was an
[2:11:12] awesome purpose great plan

[2:11:16] plan
