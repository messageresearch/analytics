you Jesus ask all these things in Jesus name Amen brother Troy this morning I think it's on now we're going to go to Psalms 127 we're going to they're just it's a little short Psalms 127 and 128 it is a privilege to have good Fathers thinking this morning well oh dismissed for Sunday school yeah gotcha it's such a privilege to have good Fathers we're talking this morning how you know life takes different people different ways and uh some people some fathers and mothers they don't seem to make it it's a privilege to be in a house uh for for the kids to be in a house where their fathers and mothers are still together and uh to have good Fathers and good Mothers and I was thinking you know what a privilege to have our heavenly father if it wasn't for him none of us would be here this morning so honor and a privilege so we'll start here in Psalms 127 and it's just a short one so we're going to do 127 and 128 this morning morning except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain Lo children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate for Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee behold that thus shall the man be blessed that fearth the Lord this one together yay Thou shalt see thy children children in peace upon Israel God bless you may be seated brother Brian Lord bless you all and all your fathers I was thinking about what brother Thomas just said about that 18yearold that wants to get out of his father house and I'd have to raise my hand I was one of those many years ago I come from one of them families where your father tells you when you're 16 years old Brian what are you going to do when you get out of high school well it's not going to be here so I was just thinking about that we all are ra different we all have different fathers not that he was a he wasn't a bad father he was a good father but he was serious about what you're going to do in your life and he would to let you know at 16 15 years old you're not going to do it around here I was just thinking about that you know he's gone now but I was just thinking that really came to my thought there and not to say that that's how you should raise your family but we're all raised different we all come from different families that have different ways we do things doesn't mean one way is better than the other just means some just funny when I was thought but I was that uh scripture we were reading the first one there except the Lord build the house they labor in vain I mean you could spend hours just talking about that one little sentence right there unless God built your house and it's built on the foundation of Jesus Christ it's all vanity it won't mean anything on that day it won't carry you over like I was saying the other week where I'm reading in Ezekiel you know it's with the devotional you know you could do all your righteousness all your life and it wouldn't mean anything on that day if you let it go and that's as I get older I realize as you fight your life every day as you struggle in things you just don't want to let it go you want to keep going forward in Christ this morning but before I get carried away here I was um I haven't done this in a while um I'm not getting any younger so so I went ahead and put all the bills of the church other than the propane bill on autopay you know we don't have no continuing City here you know so you never know when you're going to be or not so all the church's bills I put on so the internet and the power and the water bill I put them on auto pay and they're not big enough amounts that not being on auto pay is going to affect the overall general fund the thing about the propane being on autofill I'd have to work out work it out with the propane company where they come every month and check the tank that way you don't wind up with a $4,000 propane bill in the middle of the year so I I hadn't talked to them about and that's something the pastor and the trustees I need to talk to before I do something like that and right now on the building fund we use the building fund to pay for the cameras and everything that they did a couple of weeks ago and that's down I put money in the building fund so we would have that to pay that and we're down to about $1,500 in the building fund and then in the general fund we're about $112,000 give or take a few change I've been paying the water bill and the electric bill in cash for the last several months so that I don't write a lot of checks CU they C cost money too so right now if everything on auto pay it should go pretty good I don't see any major expense expenses through the summer other than what they still want to do in the church with the back and the cameras and stuff I know brother Micah told me that he's got to get a few more things to fix what went wrong so I hadn't got the bills for that so that's where we're at with the finances right now like I I don't I don't know if I'm the scary person to talk to or not but I always tell you don't be afraid to ask to me about how I do the finances or how I do it I'm more than able to talk the only thing I won't ever say since I've been what I've probably been the church's treasurer for what's 2000 probably 20 21 years now so that's been a long time but if we'll go back to uh Psalms um 26 I was listening to a message this morning but and then I'm going to jump up to I'll just read it's not a long Psalm either and I was just thinking as I get older I'm as I read I'll give you a chance to turn there Psalm 26 really has us examining ourselves as as people but I'll just read it Judge Me Oh Lord for I have walked in my integrity and I have trusted also in the Lord therefore I shall not slide so David saying everything that he's done he's his Integrity is based on being in the lord it's not his own personal Integrity which we all have all of us have our own personal but this Integrity is the Integrity that God gives you to fulfill his word and he goes on to say examine me oh Lord and prove me try my Reigns in my heart so David is continually asking if you go through all the Psalms David is continually asking the Lord to try him to prove him to make sure that he's on a stable ground in what he's believing and what he's doing and he goes on to say for thy love and kindness is before mine eyes and I have walked in thy truth I have not sat with vain persons neither will I go with dissemblers and when I read a scripture like this fourth scripture here you can bring it in into our day and age whether you are an old man a young man whatever a young woman woman an old woman with all the technology out there you can take a that fourth scripture right there and apply it to your life right now this morning are you do you find yourself drifting in things online or drifting in things in the world that you shouldn't be drifting into and that's what and you know especially online it's if you're not careful there's all kind of vain people online this morning so you got to be careful about that it goes on I have hated the congregation of the evildoers and it will not sit with the wicked I will wash my hands in iny so I will Compass thine altar oh Lord that I may publish with the voice of Thanksgiving and tell all the one tell all the wondrous work you know that's the thing about a Christian Christian isn't going to live in the negative he's always going to live in the positive doesn't mean that things don't happen to you where you have a bad bad thoughts or bad ideas but you're always going to live in the positive not in the negative and he goes on to say Lord I have loved thy habitations of thy house and the places where thy honor dwelleth and not bringing it into our day and age that's you this morning God chose you to dwell in this morning you're that habitation that he wants to have in the world that we live in this morning he through you he wants to show the world who he is this morning and he goes on gather not my soul with the Sinners nor my life with the bloody men whose hands is mischief and their right hand is full of bribes that's the world we live in this morning it hasn't changed in 4,000 years People Are People they're going to be just the technology to have that's the only thing that's changed people are people I I I thing I say a lot but as for me I will walk in my Integrity Redeem Me be merciful unto me my foot standeth in an even place in the congregation will I bless the Lord I like that word evening every evening Place everything that David did was in a balance everything everything in his life was in a balance with the word of God nothing was more one way or the other and then if you would jump with me if I haven't lost my place here uh to I probably have knowing myself the 13th chapter of 2 Corinthians this is where Paul's talking to the Corinthian church this morning I know I get in a hurry I apologize for that but you know thing I was thinking about being Father's Day you know to be a good father a father was just the leader he's he's the leadership for that family he's who God's chosen to be the leader for that family and I always I know I I've probably said this before there's two things about being a good leader two things that are really important I know Integrity is important all those virtues are important but there's two things that people have to know about you you to be a good leader one thing is they always have to know your mind and I say that a lot what I mean by your mind they know no matter what happens in the in life whatever circumstances come especially being a good father whatever happens they know that you're going to do the right thing no matter what happens you're always going to do the right thing no ma how much it hurts your hide how much it's going to put you off odds you're always going to do the right thing that's one of the most important things and the next important thing is you're going to be empathetic and you're going to care for the people around you and if they bite your fingers off you're still going to do it because again goes back to that first thing it's the right thing to do and then that another thing to be a good leader or be a good father you always have to train the people that you're around you whether they want to be trained or not whether your son or your daughter want to be instructed you're always going to go out of your way to make sure instructed in the things of life so they're successful and you always train people you whether it's look at your family you're always going to train your sons and daughters so that if you're not here that day that they've had an example and they've been given the word Al life and the truth and no matter whether you're here or not they'll be able to be successful in their life in whatever they endeav to do and that's a good between a good leader and a bad leader a bad leader is going to hold power he's not going to share power with people and he won't disseminate and give it out that's the difference and if you're Christians are not that way they always go out of their way to help people whether it's going to hurt them or not they're just going to do the right thing and let me get back to this 13th chapter here and this is the third time I've come to you in the mouth of two or three witness shall every word be established I've told you before excuse me I've foretold you as was present second time being absent now I write to them which henceforth have sinned and to all the others that if I come again I will not spare since you seek proof of Christ speaking in me and you can bring this back to our day and age you have proof that God has spoke to us in this age speaking in me which to you word is not weak but is mighty in you for though he was crucified through weakness yet he lived by the power of God for we are also weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you and I was just thinking about this fifth goes back to the psalm I read earlier and Paul says here examine yourself whether you be in the faith prove your own selves know you not that your own selves how Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobates but I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates now I pray God that you do know we that's what I like about old brother Paul he always is encouraging to the people now I pray to God that you do know evil not that we should appear approved but that you should do that which is honest but we be as reprobates so no matter what was going on in their lives he was always telling them to do the right thing and I I wrote this this I was listening to that message this morning and it it really struck me what he he I'm paraphrasing this is not exactly if you have a lot of problems in your life are you listening to that small voice and this is what if you're listening to anything other than that still Small Voice in your life anything else other than that which is the presence of the Holy Ghost and Christ through you speaking to your circumstances in your life which brings you your strength he goes this is what brother Brown had he said then you need to go back to that cave you need to go back to where it all started again and start over again and then he wrote he he in that message he said you need to get back to that cave always remember that the voice is always centered in the Bible and in his word so that voice when you see that voice speaks to you this morning it's always going to be centered in the word of God the message of the hour in the Bible if that voice is having you do things other than this this morning then it ain't God's voice speaking to you Brother David I our GL [Applause] I'm glad well Jesus has come and my cups overrun and oh say but I'm glad amen are you glad oh say but I'm glad I'm glad yes oh but I'm glad I'm glad for Jesus has come and my cups over run oh say but I'm glad amen you'll have to clap this morning because I've got to hold this so amen God bless you it's good to see each and everyone here this morning God bless you brother eston it's good to have y'all with us this morning and amen just happy and you got Hal May with us this morning all right let's give the Lord a hand amen for her and sister alah being here this morning amen and amen and I know Grandpa crossed the AIS happy and I heard the other day from a little bird that you're going to be grandpa again wow that's awesome so maybe she'll be born on Min and the baby will be born

the house of the Lord is't it amen once I was lost in sin I had no peace within to save my we so I knew not how but Jesus came to me and by his grace I'm free and now it's different oh so different

to our hearts this morning and open US Open open our hearts to make us an open book that you could speak to us father we just love you with all of our hearts this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen I want to read you a little quote to get started here and I want you to think about this and brother Brandon's preaching and he says he says God is trying to get man to look to that innocent substitute for a way back and man wants to look at it in his own way there's where we get in trouble and he said he don't want to see what God is trying to show him in this innocent substitute therefore that's what caused the trouble he said then man what he does he picks up the glasses to view off in a long distance to see what God's trying to show him and he fails to focus his glasses right yep yeah turn with me to Daniel 10 and we'll read there for several verses one of my favorite scriptures and lessons in the Bible and just how God moves and I just appreciate it so Daniel 10 and verse one in the third year of Cyrus King of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was called belto jesar and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision in those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks what a place to be in that you're mourning for for three full weeks I ate no Pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine to my mouth neither did I anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled and in the fourth and 20th day of the first month as I was by the side of the Great River which is ekiel then I lifted up my eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with fine gold of eaz his body was also like Barrel his face as the appearance of lightning and his eyes as lamps of fire his arms and his feet like the color to Polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude and I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were there with me saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves so can you imagine here's Daniel seeing this man come down from God and it's such a such an appearance such an Awakening and the the the Earth began to quake and the men couldn't see this man but just the very anointing and the presence of God moving on the scene shook these men to flee woo therefore I was left alone and I saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned unto uh in me into corruption and I regain retained no strength yet I heard the voice of his words and when he heard the voice of when I heard the voice of his words then I was in a deep sleep fell up on my face and my face toward the ground and behold a hand touched me which set me upon my knees and on the palms of my hands so now here's Daniel has fallen down to his hands and knees at the very presence of this being that's standing before him the anointing has made the others flee and now here Daniel is on his hands and knees at the entity of of God before him and he said he spake unto me and said oh Daniel a man greatly beloved is't that the way you want to be approached by God understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright for now I For unto thee am I now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling then said he unto me fear not Daniel for from the first day for from the first day wow thou that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasen thyself before God thy words were heard and I come for thy words from the first day from the first time from the first words from the first desire from the first need from the first situation I heard you and I come I'm come for your words but watch what happens but the prince of the kingdom of Persia so now here's the enemy and Satan now has has this being that's come into into into this this uh between the the conversation between God and and between Daniel and what he's asking from God and so now Satan has now put this demon power in there this evil anointing to come down there to interrupt to destroy destroy to dispute to dishearten to discourage how many times have we prayed and been discouraged sure we have what's happening behind the scenes is Satan has put a prince of an entire Kingdom to come and interrupt what we have need of from God the kingdom of the Prince of Persia withstood me one in 20 days 21 days and but low Michael one of the chief princes thank God that there's a higher power he came to help me and I remained there with the kings of Persia but now I am come to make thee uh understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days and when he had spoken such words unto me I set my face toward the ground and I became dumb do we have first the Thessalonians can you bring up first Thessalonians you can look at it on the screen save you some page turning 1 Thessalonians 5:1 17 says pray without ceasing let's all say that together pray without ceasing you can have your seats may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word sometimes I think that maybe where we fall a little short first Thessalonians 5 brother brandham tells a story and he tells a story of a young girl that was in love with a young man and this young man ended up marrying another woman and it broke this young girl's heart and she was at a place in her life where she couldn't get over it and she kept making excuses and and trying to figure out this situation and and and so things were going going a little bit of R in her life and but brother brandham looks at it and he said' but she had a different kind of heart trouble it was a spiritual heart trouble he said yes her lover had run off and married some other woman and yet she was still in love and she thought this boy still loved her and she's blaming on the father from what I can gather from the story he's BL she's blaming it on the father and trying to explain all this to brother brandom what's going on and why she's in the place that she's in and brother Brandon looks at her and he says oh nonsense you talking about some playing Kentucky English oh nonsense he said he didn't have to go and marry that other girl he did it because he failed to have the right kind of love for you he says that's exactly he said but see you're all wound up into that he said this girl sitting there in such a stoop like she's letting this situation control completely control her life she's sitting there in a stoop like and she's saying oh I know Johnny loves me I know he does and he says there that that's all she could see all she could see was that she thought Johnny loved her and he says that's all she could see she lived in that one little world by herself until she had formed herself in there and he said and I took a hold of her hand and I said listen to me he said the Lord showed me a vision he said and she knew that I didn't know about a situation that transaction that had happened between them and he said and when I said that it snapped her right out real quick he said and I said now while you're out of there look to Calvary while you're out of that little mully grubs while you're out of that little world that you built around yourself while you're in out of that world of depression and anxiety look to Calvary he says look to Calvary he said you're going out there and you've tried to start drinking he said you're a Minister's daughter a Pentecostal Minister's daughter doing the things that you're doing and you're all you're trying to do is drown out your Sorrows he said that man somebody that don't care the snap of your fingers for you he said I said look to Calvary girl that's the way back and he says we got to get ourselves focused now he's talking to the congregation we got to get ourselves focused we got to get ourselves focused to whether we live or die or sink or drown it's Calvary that's where we look to it's Calvary no matter what happens in our life he says that's the thing that God wants us to come back to you see brothers and sisters a lot of times in Christ we can find all the answers to our problems but we fail to tap in to the resources of that power everything we have need of God lays before us and we fail to use it and utilize it there's a a story a true story about a woman in Wales this Welsh woman she lived out in a remote Valley somewhere and for years she saved her money and saved all of her her savings and and worked hard and went through a lot of trouble and expense and she wanted to have the electrical company come and put Power in her home so for years she saved up and got all this done so they come and the electrical company comes and they they run the electricity down there and they hook up the line and and they go about their way and they say there you go you've got to electricity use it as you want it just use all you need we've got all we need use it all time goes on and Electrical Company notices after a couple of months that there's not any electricity much being used just a minute amount of electricity is being used and they thought well maybe something's wrong with the hookup so they send out a technician to go out there they send out a meter reader and the meter reader and the technician go and they look and they begin to check everything out and they knock on her door and they say ma'am we notice you're not using much electricity but we we can't find that there's any problem and and she says oh no yeah there's no there's no problem we're quite satisfied and they she said we turn on the electric lights every night so we can see how to light our lamps and then we turn them back off true story and we laugh and we chuckle but let's let's app this and let look at this why was it why didn't this woman make more use of her electricity she said because I am satisfied how many times are we sitting here satisfied with where we're at murmuring complaining Molly grubbing not getting all that God has in store for us and we're quite satisfied let me tell you she beli believed in that electricity she believed in the electricity she believed that that that that that that everything she had need of was right there she believed in the promises she believed in the promises the electric company told her that she could have all things we're letting that sink in just a little bit she went to a great deal of trouble to get these wires run into her house but what she didn't understand is she didn't understand the potential of the electricity in her home are you with me she could have cooked on an electric stove she didn't have to go build a fire in an oven anymore and toll over that and sweat over that she didn't have to she didn't have to go out there and wash clothes on a old washboard anymore no she could have had an electric washer she didn't have to set in the SM smelter in heat like can you imagine today without air conditioning I hope all of us have air conditioning thank God for air conditioning she could have had air conditioning but she failed to realize the power that laid within her very house where's the power that lays within our house where is the power what do we do with the power are we using it sparingly are we using the power that God has given us sparingly I believe that's a reason that sometimes things happen like that for at least for some Christians because they don't understand exactly how prayer works you know sometimes I believe people uh they they get to a place that they and they think well it really doesn't matter if I pray or not yeah it really doesn't matter if I pray or not or are they believe well God's going to do what God's going to do so what does it matter why I bother I tell you Prayer Changes Things I said Prayer Changes Things prayer will remove tumors Prayer Will Fix heart valves prayer will give you Deliverance of anything you have need of prayer is a deliverer it's a redeemer prayer will take a prodical child and turn them around in the middle of the road and send them back home that's what prayer does that's right but sometimes we look at prayer we we we we think oh I I'll pray when all else fails when the bank don't give me alone I'll pray when the doctors say they can't do nothing we'll pray it's not when the doctors say they can't do nothing it's when the when the problem starts we begin to pray because when you pray God begins to move on the scene but yeah we sometimes look at it like a hell marry pass in a football game yeah yeah there's there's Christians that do that they just throw up a prayer in hopes that some way somehow God will hear them but in their hearts they don't view prayer as making an impact in their lives I'm going to tell you brothers and sisters on a day-to-day life day-to-day business day-to-day your life prayer makes a difference and prayer needs to be a big major part of the first thing you do in the morning God Lead Me Guide Me take me where I need to go God make me say what I need to say let me tell you how important it is Daniel Prayed three times every day and theologians think that he had an actual prayer chamber built with the windows permanently open facing Jerusalem so that no nobody could shut him out nobody was going to stop Daniel from making contact with God so he prayed and he prayed for three days what was he doing for three times a day he prayed in the Lion's Den he prayed for for wisdom he prayed for guidance he prayed that God would forgive the people of Israel and turn them around back to their homes that's what Daniel was doing he was a prayer Warrior and Daniel now struggling for and prayer for 21 days 21 days how many of us Christians please don't raise your hands with struggle to pray 21 days for one thing oh I can tell by your I can tell by your by your looks you don't have to raise your hands some of us struggle to pray for two days let's just be let's just just get to the reality of it sometimes we struggle to even get anything before God because we live in such a fast-paced uh hectic world that man sometimes we even forget what our even needs are what is most desire in our life to even take to God but 21 days Daniel looked here Daniel stayed here and Daniel knew that if I'm going to have victory in my life I've got to stay before God yeah brothers and sisters he didn't rely on his he didn't rely on his knowledge he didn't rely on maybe well maybe if this happens that that things will get better for Israel he didn't he didn't sit there and rely upon wishful thinking how many times we do that I hope I hope this situation turns around I hope my child comes back to God why are you hoping Why not start believing Why not start praying day after day after after day after day until you get the victory just like Daniel the victory is yours because he knew with God I'll find my answers he knew with God I can find my answers with God I'll find Deliverance in this Lion's Den can you imagine those Fierce lons you think they wasn't hungry and starving and wanting some some fresh warm blood and flesh in their mouth you'd go to praying too if you never prayed you'd start praying but he knew that if he could just get before God there would be Deliverance in the Lion's Den he knew that if he would find it the that with God he could find direction in his life and he knew with God he could find the answers of his way and he knew with God he could have Victory think about those three hrew children when they stand there and are going before a furnace has been heated over and over and over and over and over time by time by time hotter than standard you think they didn't know that they had to start praying they needed a God to move on the scene or they was going to be crispy Critters and so they begin to pray and they found out that With God all things are possible and if we want the victory in our lives brothers and sisters we this morning we got to call God on the scene to our battles to where we don't give up to where we don't give in just keep calling and let God know that the answer is on the way be persistent persistent prayer will get you results I didn't say Prosperity we better not get on those guys yeah Paul Harvey you know the rest of the story right he tells a story about a three-year-old boy him and his mom are gone to the grocery store and they enter into the grocery store right before they get in she said now son let me tell you no chocolate chip cookies today don't even ask she puts him in the buggy in the seat and the what y'all laughing you like chocolate chip cookies and she puts them in a basket in the little seat you know the little thing with in the front of the buggy and so they begin to go down through the aisles there and she's going back and forth and willing through the aisles and everything's going good until they come up to the cookie aisle and that little boy looks at he says mom can I have some chocolate chip cookies she said I told you you're not getting any cookies today sit down down and be quiet how many of you Mama's ever done that yep so they go on and they're going through the store well it searching for items for the house the it brings them back through the cookie aisle one more time they come through the cookie aisle and he's sitting there and he's thinking man I I shouldn't but I got to I shouldn't but I got to mom please let me have some chocolate chip cookies please I told you no cookies now sit down and be quiet if I have to tell you again how many's heard that if I have to tell you again so he's sitting there and they're going through the store and it's time to get to the checkout AIS they get get ready to go up to the counter and the mom's going through there and what do you think's at the checkout counter chips a Hoy soft batch and he's thinking if I'm ever going to get these cookies it's now or never if I'm if I'm ever going to have a chance to get one of these cookies in my mouth it's now or never so he stands up in the cart as she's getting ready to enter and he shouts with his loudest voice in the name of Jesus can I have some chocolate chip cookies he took home 23 bags of chocolate chip cookies because all the people in the store thought it was the cutest thing you get what you ask for you can ask me for something and I can say no you can ask brother Bor for something he can say no you can ask your mama your daddy you can ask of your kids they can say no but you ask of Jesus watch for things to start happening accept your cookies this morning so we look at Daniel here and it tells us on the first day it says since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and humble yourself before God your words were heard now that's important to know that this wasn't the first time that Daniel had ever heard from God it says in Daniel 923 and Daniel calls upon the Lord and and it says as soon as you begin to pray the answer was given which I come to tell you you're highly esteemed So Daniel no doubt had heard from the Lord before I hope all of us have heard from the Lord before and so when we think about this it's important to know that every time that you and I pray that God gladly hears our prayers not only does he gladly hear our prayers but at the very instant that our word goes before God angels are sent before us angels are get sent before us to start carrying out the ministry you say man I don't know about that did we did we read our scripture there was there was an angel there was a spiritual battle that began to take place as soon as Daniel word made it to the throne of God so from the very first day Daniel Prayed his prayer this angels were begin to get sent and we look here and we see that this is this is one of those rare times that we get to kind of see behind the curtains you know you some of you I'm sure all of us have been to a play at some point in time and you go to the play and in between the scenes they shut the curtains right and you don't know what's going on but in the background they're moving chairs they're moving the drums they're moving all this stuff they're changing the way the scenes happening well this in the Bible right here this has given us a little portion that we can be see and peek right through the curtains maybe the curtains hadn't completely shut on this scene and so God is showing us here what is happening behind the scenes that these demonic forces are rising up and this Angelic Warfare breaks out upon the upon the request of Daniel's prayer do you realize that demonic forces break out when you pray to God so this means that when you pray you turn loose Powers every Power from Heaven is turned loose in your defense this means that when you pray that angels are willing to fight for you at the word of God how many times have we read and heard the prophet say that when the when Moses and this is coming now when Moses was going through that little basket basket as a baby through them crocodiles and he said there there they set the Angel up on the very bow of the ship and he said he called wormwood said let me go down there he said no this is mine this is my battle so the angels are give out there Hebrews tells us that angels are ministering Spirits sent to minister to those who are Heirs of Salvation how many of us are Heirs of Salvation so you think God don't send you ministering Angels when you have a need in your life these angels begin to come and move on the scene and here so the angels I want you to know that the angels are at your back and call what kind of people are we what kind of people are we yeah that God cares so much that he would take something from the set and worshiping him and idolizing him and praising him and say Hey you go down there to brother Glenn he's laying up there in that hospital he needs something done to his blood yes my Lord 21 days and the angel was sent on the first day but 21 days later the angel arrives was God hard to hear was he unconcerned was he deliberate and and holding back for his child no but the wickedness of the world said we don't want Israel to get what they got coming we don't want the wickedness of the world says we don't want those children of God to have what God wants them to have we don't want them to overcome in this hour we don't want them to give up cigarettes and drinking and pornography we don't want them to give up the the filthiness around the lives that they live we don't want them to have their children back we don't want them to have Financial Freedom are you seeing behind the curtains now so now these angels are going in there and they're getting in there and so God begins to listen he hear hears your word and as soon as you're praying for somebody maybe as somebody you want to become a Christian maybe it's somebody in your family that's that's got away from God I want you to know that every prayer you pray puts more and more and more pressure for that person to listen to God let me tell you what the difference is the difference is this you see you have somebody in your life a family member a friend you want them to come to the Lord and you begin to pressure you begin to talk to them you begin to get down there and well if you don't do this I tell you what time's at hand I tell you what we're getting close you better be ready you just watch them turn and walk away that's not going to work I said that's not going to work but if you'll take and get down on your hands and knees before God and say God this is my child you gave me this child you gave me this loved one I'll come before you now and I ask that you send ministering spirits to them that you would work on their lives that you would change their hearts that you would change their desires and watch and see if that person don't gradually begin to ease into church and he's a little closer into church and before you know it they're sitting on the back row before you know it they're on the the middle of the church before you know it they're shouting and screaming and dancing why because God done the delivering not you not me but [Applause] God every prayer we pray sends power to God I want you to know prayer is not a passive Act you know passive is setting back and just kind of going with the flow that's not what prayer is prayer is an aggressive act of ministry prayer is you putting your shoulder to the wheel and say if they don't believe for you God I'll believe for them if they don't believe they can be healed I'm going to believe for them if they don't love you Lord I'm going to love for you for them one man I was reading one illustration said they were asking him he was a man of prayer and they were asking him about his prayer life and he said when I pray I push I thought what in the world did I read that wrong but he said when everything seems to go wrong I push he said whenever everything on the job gets me down I push he said when people don't react the way I think they should I push he said when when money looks funny and bills are due I push he said when I when I want to get get at people and get angry at people for the way they treat me I push he said and when people just don't understand me I push he said push stands for pray until something happens let that stick in your mind pray until until something happens don't settle for the situation don't settle for being a temper ridden person don't settle for that but pray until God moves on the scene we had a situation yesterday and I I I shouldn't probably bring this up but I'm going to we had a situation on the golf course yesterday some of these younger kids that can hit at a mile didn't see the people in front of us they hit their golf balls into these people we were in a tournament so lo and behold Here Comes this guy barreling back at us on a golf cart and he's about as red as I don't know what he got thankfully thank the Lord he went to the cart the other people that was with me and he's over there and he's waving and he's cussing and he's he's mad and he's and I thought to myself I thought what would I have done if he'd come to me and I thought I would have just said sorry buddy I we didn't see you and I thought Lord thank you for giving me that kind of attitude because it would have been easy to say you don't talk to me that way I'm gonna shut your mouth we're human right they don't give us an excuse but I'm glad that I was able to think ahead and think what would I have done and then put myself in that situation because I can tell you that when you pray and you pray for your day to go right and you pray that you have the right attitude it'll help you make it through those trying times as a country and and the worldwide on June the 6th of this year we honored the 80th Ann iversary of dday on dday the 6th of June 1944 I Allied Forces

that's not a victory that's just being beat up let me tell you if I was a boxer and or if I thought I was a boxer and I got in a boxing ring time and time and time again and all I was doing was picking my blood up off the mat and all I was doing was picking my teeth up going home with black eyes I may not consider myself much of a boxer and that's the way it is with these people that call themselves so-called Christians they're letting the devil beat them up beat them up beat them up I'm a Christian I go to church every Sunday I don't know about Wednesdays and Thursdays and special events you picking your teeth up off the floor get in the battle be hot so God has full confidence in your in your Victory this morning God has full confidence in the Devotion to your duty and your skill and he'll accept nothing less than full Victory so so what that tells me is depression is defeated anxiety is defeated all these Spirits are defeated sickness defeated heart trouble cancer tumor fear fear is a liar it's defeated why do we fear when we have the power of An Almighty God that hears every word we speak so I tell you this morning I tell you this morning that there is a day if there was a d day there is a v day there was a day when you got to declare to Satan today's the last day you pushed me anymore that was your day of Declaration that you started a battle let me tell you you won't plague me no more Satan and you're going to fight that battle and you're going to fight that battle over and over and over but there's going to come a day when you say that trouble that I used to have that once plagued me I have no trouble at all because God has Set Me Free and God I have the victory today is my V day we need a V Day Moses had to have a V Day Moses come up to the Red Sea Pharaoh all about him a half a million troubles are surrounded him yeah but he went to God and the word says the prophet said he focused his eyes on God he wasn't focused in looking at a half a million troubles around him he was focused on the victory on the other side that's how Miriam picked up that tambourine and she began to wave and she began to dance and she be to shout why because they had Victory Joshua come into a place he come up to that River we've been preaching on these things for the last year here Joshua come up to that River and the prophet said he come right there and he looked there he seen them walls but he didn't focus on those walls he didn't look at how tall they was he didn't look at how wide they was he looked on the other side and see crumbled ruins of a fallen enemy yeah quit looking around your surroundings and all your problems and start looking to the one who solves your problems the prophet said God lets disappointments happen why to show your Victory now he ain't talking to that halfway guy no that's not who he's talking to he's talking to that dedicated prayer Warrior the one who knows what it's like to talk to God lip to ear and hear and he hears you and answers back and begins to send those those ministering Angels down that's the one he's talking to he lets those disappointments happen to show your Victory we think about job we think about Job in the Bible man you talking about a test you talking about a trial you talking about somebody that no doubt was doing some praying Satan said let me have job let me have him he's a perfect servant let me have him oh you can do anything you want to to him I talk to him all the time I know where he stands you know sometimes I wonder if God knows where we stand because if we even talk to him but I know where job stands you can do anything you want to him you poke and you PR and you make him sick you do everything but the one thing you can't do is take his life do you think job sat there and cried over his bulls do you think job sat there and said man look at this I got these balls all over me I can't I can't stand a look at this look at all these bulls look at all my possessions leaving look at all my cattle look at all my sheep and all my goats and all of my possessions look at all of that he never even once looked looked at that he didn't he didn't look and focus on what was going around but he looked and he set his eyes and he focused on a god of restoration it wasn't about what was happening at that time it was about what God was going to give back to [Music] him God is good I'm trying to close up here he says that's what the devil is so after us us about you want to know why the devil SE after us here I'm fixing to tell you he says that's what the devil s after the bride the church for because it's getting close to vday it ain't always going to be like this it ain't always going to be hard and trials and troubles it ain't always going to be a battle one of these days there's going to be a v day and when we V day we going to March right over over there to that marriage supper and I'm going to say give me my plate I'm hungry he says we have to fight the fight of Faith let us fight the good fight of Faith complete our victory for our complete Victory is positive he said we have the first fruits of it we have the evidence of it in our our heart now because we've already got the first battle behind us we have been able to conquer through the faith of Jesus Christ we've had our vday Ken peppercorn as I close Ken pepper corn he was on that day in 1944 and he tells the account when the ship pulled up and the gate let down and he had to step out well he fell he fell off the ramp and he fell off the ramp of that landing craft and he went into an underwater shell hole and he went under this hole and he said I nearly went under he said I was loaded with all this equipment and hand grenades in my pockets and magazines in my pouches and everything else I could carry sometimes we we got all this ammunition and we got the grenad ad with the devil's name on it we got M we got bullets that say Satan and enemy and hate and envy we got all the ammunition we need to take it out but we slip and fall and he said I thought I was gone he said I thought I was going down he said the sea around him was red with blood he said it was quite a mess but I just had to keep going I think about this war they tried to recreate a scene in the movie Saving Private Ry and they show just a small portion of the beach and just in order to try to portray it as accurate as possible they put over 2,200 gallons of artificial blood into the sea it's a mess war is a mess battle is a mess can you imagine 50 miles of that beach front covered in blood and he said I just kept treading through it and I managed to surface to get to that beach we were under Fire and I scrambled up the dunes and and found a shell crater to shelter in he said I was so hungry and this was a first this was after the first few days he was wounded in his leg by shrapnel taken prisoner by the Germans nearly all the troops in his company were dead sometimes we get in those positions in those places we fight we battle we we get in there we we're fist to fist nose to nose with Satan sometimes he gets a few licks in on us sometimes he gets a few punches in maybe you might had a bloody nose once a black eye but he said I just kept saying to myself you're going back home brothers and sisters we're going back home we're going back home there's a restoration taking place and the Bride of Jesus Christ is going back home let's stand to our feet the musicians would come I read that first uh first quote brother Brandon was talking about keeping your eyes on the innocent substitute what made him bring that up as he was talking he said here not long ago he said I had a pair of field glasses he's talking about binoculars he said I was trying to watch some antalope over in a field or an antalope he said he said my son was trying to show me and he's quite a bit younger so he said take them glasses daddy there stands the antalope right there and I said I can see it with my natural eye he said but take these glasses he said when I looked I seen about 10 antelopes he said but the glasses was out of focus sometimes we see 10 problems sometimes we see 10 obstacles sometimes we see all these negative things that's happening around our lives but he said when I got those glasses and he said when I went to focus on in there was one no matter how many problems you see through your natural eyes if we could just focus in on the one who can answer the problems the one who can fix the problems you love the Lord let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day you given us for the love you've shown it this morning Lord Jesus and for your word going forth and touching not only my heart but I trust others as well and what a what an encouragement it was just to just to be able to study this and to preach this and thank you for it Lord I trust Lord that we're able to take these words in the week to come and know that we are a special group of people that when we pray before you Lord every single word every breath we utter makes it to your throne and upon the the confession and once that word is heard by you that there is ministering Spirits there's answers coming our way if we could just continue to hold on if we could just continue to hold on so no matter what we battle no matter what we having to declare war against in our lives just help us Lord to stay faithful in the battle to stay faithful in our prayer life to stay committed and dedicated to you Lord that one day when we can come before you and say Lord I have my my vday I had my victory the things that once plagued me the things that once haunted me the things that once hindered me the things that kept me from going to church the things that kept me
