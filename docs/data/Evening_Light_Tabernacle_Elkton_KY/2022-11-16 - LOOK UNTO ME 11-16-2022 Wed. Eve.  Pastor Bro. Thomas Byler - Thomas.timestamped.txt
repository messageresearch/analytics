[59:49] take counsel together who have declared
[59:51] this from the ancient time who had told
[59:53] it from that time have not had a lord
[59:55] there is no God help no God else besides
[59:58] me it's just God and a savior there is
[1:00:01] none beside me look unto me and be saved

[1:00:09] I have sworn by myself and the word is
[1:00:11] going out of my mouth and righteousness
[1:00:13] and shall not return that unto me every
[1:00:17] knee shall bow and every tongue shall
[1:00:18] swear
[1:00:19] surely shall one say and the Lord have I
[1:00:22] righteousness and strength even to him

[1:00:38] you can be seated tonight I want to
[1:00:40] speak on look unto me amen
[1:00:45] amen as I was meditating today on what
[1:00:47] to speak on and I was just meditating on
[1:00:49] the Lord and thinking about him you know
[1:00:52] and how wonderful he is and all the
[1:00:54] things that we've already said that he
[1:00:55] is amen like uh he's the alpha he's the
[1:00:59] Amigo he's the
[1:01:02] he's everything in between one place he
[1:01:04] says I am the whole creation and Jesus
[1:01:07] is my name
[1:01:08] amen
[1:01:09] the Bible talks about him he is all and
[1:01:12] in all so I got to thinking of how you
[1:01:15] know uh and I asked myself this question
[1:01:18] and I'm going to ask you tonight you
[1:01:20] know uh
[1:01:21] uh can we ever he says can we ever cease
[1:01:25] to be amazed with God
[1:01:29] amen can we ever come to the place to
[1:01:32] where we think well that's all there is
[1:01:34] to know that's all there is to having
[1:01:36] God
[1:01:40] amen can we ever get bored with God
[1:01:45] no
[1:01:47] amen I got to thinking that's right amen
[1:01:50] we don't we don't know uh well put it
[1:01:54] this way we don't know what we don't
[1:01:55] know
[1:01:57] but there's a lot we don't know about
[1:01:59] God
[1:02:00] amen and you can just take a little bit
[1:02:03] of God and think about him now there's a
[1:02:05] lot that we do understand about God Amen
[1:02:08] truly there is a lot that we understand
[1:02:09] but there's still uh there is no
[1:02:13] searching Bible says one place of his
[1:02:15] understanding
[1:02:16] hey man you can't even begin to imagine
[1:02:18] when you think about God
[1:02:21] and what he is and how he is his power
[1:02:23] and his uh
[1:02:25] Eternal headship and so forth and
[1:02:26] everything that is
[1:02:28] but tonight we want to just you know
[1:02:30] look at this because usually when I
[1:02:32] preach When anybody preaches usually on
[1:02:34] look unto me or looking to God and so
[1:02:37] forth we always go back to Israel and
[1:02:39] how that you know whenever they were
[1:02:41] murmuring and complaining and the
[1:02:42] serpents begin to bite them and die in
[1:02:45] tens of thousands of guests who died you
[1:02:47] know and they were all dying and so
[1:02:49] forth and they were screaming when for
[1:02:51] help and begging for mercy and and God
[1:02:54] told Moses to put up a brass serpent in
[1:02:56] that right a pole and put a brass
[1:02:58] serpent on a pole
[1:03:00] you know it kind of this might seem like
[1:03:02] a strange thing to do amen but that's
[1:03:05] what he told him to do and he did and
[1:03:06] and he he says if you're bitten you know
[1:03:09] all you got to do is look
[1:03:12] and he won't die
[1:03:14] [Laughter]
[1:03:16] how many records that God knew what he
[1:03:18] was doing when he did that he knew why
[1:03:19] to put it on the pole he knew to use a
[1:03:22] serpent which represents sin judged
[1:03:25] isn't that right and that serpent was
[1:03:27] represented Christ on the pole our sins
[1:03:30] on the Paul judged right amen judgment
[1:03:34] price means you know and and there is no
[1:03:37] life outside of looking at the pole
[1:03:39] outside of looking at the cross outside
[1:03:42] of looking at Christ there is no way
[1:03:44] that you'll ever live
[1:03:46] I am the way I am the truth I am the
[1:03:48] wife no man comes to the father but by
[1:03:50] me there's no other way no other
[1:03:52] religion no nothing else that you can
[1:03:54] look to in life
[1:03:56] and live
[1:03:58] except Jesus Christ accept the cross
[1:04:01] amen and we begin to think about how
[1:04:03] great God is and so forth amen and what
[1:04:06] he is and so forth we want to with the
[1:04:08] help of the Lord just go over some of
[1:04:10] these things you know because I believe
[1:04:11] he's uh inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[1:04:17] inexhaustible Fountain of knowledge and
[1:04:20] wisdom he's a life he's uh inexhaustible
[1:04:24] a fountain of love and grace and mercy
[1:04:29] when you think about all that God is
[1:04:31] sometimes it might make you think that
[1:04:33] he's way out there but I want to bring
[1:04:36] him down home tonight if I can with the
[1:04:37] help of the Lord
[1:04:38] amen
[1:04:41] oh my I think about it and we'll always
[1:04:43] God help us never
[1:04:47] as a prophet put it I believe it was
[1:04:51] um let me think just how I had a couple
[1:04:52] different phrases never let it become
[1:04:54] common to you
[1:04:57] but another thing he says don't never
[1:04:59] lose your enthusiasm for God
[1:05:02] the devil lost his enthusiasm he let
[1:05:05] Heaven become common to him
[1:05:07] amen people let me this is this both
[1:05:09] here and all out there think about it
[1:05:12] you know if we let Church become common
[1:05:14] to us
[1:05:15] because this is where we come to worship
[1:05:17] and praise and and adore and love him
[1:05:21] isn't that right if that becomes boring
[1:05:23] to us what's ever going to be after a
[1:05:25] while
[1:05:26] I say tonight before church gets boring
[1:05:29] to you I'm not so sure that heaven's
[1:05:32] going to be a place you want to be
[1:05:35] well I should never get boring
[1:05:37] should never I don't care how dark I
[1:05:39] don't care how windy and stormy we
[1:05:42] should always enjoy coming to the house
[1:05:44] of God always worshiping the Lord from
[1:05:48] now to Eternity
[1:05:50] so we look at looking let's look at
[1:05:52] looking people like to look
[1:05:55] huh
[1:05:57] but you know people love to look at what
[1:05:59] God made talking about the house is not
[1:06:02] greater than he that built it but people
[1:06:04] will travel you know how much money
[1:06:06] spent on traveling and going seeing
[1:06:08] places
[1:06:10] they love the Swiss Elks we love the
[1:06:12] mountains we love all of that we're
[1:06:14] going to go to look at all of that
[1:06:17] just to see the beauty and there's some
[1:06:19] places that just uh
[1:06:22] breathtaking right there's Just Breath
[1:06:25] they take Colorado into these places
[1:06:27] under these places it's just
[1:06:29] breathtaking just to look at them and
[1:06:31] and and kind of people just love to look
[1:06:34] at these the great creation
[1:06:36] huh
[1:06:38] but I had to think you know people like
[1:06:40] to look at that but you know they ought
[1:06:42] to focus more on looking at the Creator
[1:06:47] if they got they got more interest in
[1:06:49] looking at the one that made it all huh
[1:06:53] because people will go there amen people
[1:06:56] will go to the mountains that made for a
[1:06:58] little rest for a little pizza you know
[1:07:00] you might go to the uh I don't know if
[1:07:03] it's called Andrew and I can't even
[1:07:05] pronounce the mountains up into Canada
[1:07:07] Andrea uh
[1:07:09] I don't know I can't pronounce something
[1:07:11] with Acts you know way up there in the
[1:07:14] mountains way far away take a plane and
[1:07:17] go and land in the water and go back
[1:07:18] there and get a little cabin better put
[1:07:21] time in get back here and maybe and
[1:07:23] we're gonna have some peace
[1:07:25] and quiet
[1:07:27] we're gonna get some rest now people
[1:07:29] love to go and they like to get a little
[1:07:31] pieces I like to have a little rest
[1:07:35] huh
[1:07:37] but you know you can be way out there
[1:07:39] and you might think that you're having
[1:07:40] some but if you don't have it in here
[1:07:41] you still don't got it
[1:07:45] the peace of God is the peace that
[1:07:47] passes understanding
[1:07:50] amen
[1:07:52] said look more for peace and find that
[1:07:54] it doesn't matter where you are you can
[1:07:57] have a peace
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:02] oh my and as you look at God think about
[1:08:04] it as you look at God
[1:08:07] and what he is
[1:08:10] you might wonder well what is God and
[1:08:12] how is he how does God feel
[1:08:15] how does God think
[1:08:18] huh
[1:08:20] how many knows you can do that
[1:08:23] let the peace of God the Bible says rule
[1:08:26] in your hearts
[1:08:28] now the place he says that peace that
[1:08:30] passes all understanding
[1:08:34] in other words it's such a peace when
[1:08:36] you've got God that you just can't
[1:08:38] explain that it's
[1:08:39] past un past explaining
[1:08:44] so I believe that you and I can have the
[1:08:46] peace of God the very peace that God has
[1:08:48] you have
[1:08:50] when you look at him and receive him
[1:08:54] because you can never let me say this
[1:08:55] how many you can never really know this
[1:08:58] God
[1:09:00] just intellectually by hearing it with
[1:09:03] your mind
[1:09:04] huh
[1:09:06] because even the Bible says he didn't
[1:09:07] have the son has life he didn't have not
[1:09:09] the son had not life
[1:09:11] in other words you you can't you know
[1:09:13] it's like trying to tell somebody about
[1:09:15] an experience
[1:09:17] that they never had
[1:09:20] huh it don't work too well
[1:09:22] you know and if you explain what God is
[1:09:25] well you don't really know until you
[1:09:26] have him
[1:09:28] it makes it different you have to have
[1:09:30] him in here to know what he's like
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:35] I mean he's glad that you can look to
[1:09:38] him and become him
[1:09:45] amen
[1:09:47] people do all kinds of things
[1:09:49] to try to have a little Joy
[1:09:55] huh
[1:09:56] they don't realize that you know it's
[1:09:58] not about things that you do that give
[1:10:00] you Joy but why don't they go into Joy
[1:10:02] Giver
[1:10:04] he is George
[1:10:07] he's peace he's Joy he's rest
[1:10:12] oh my
[1:10:14] there's nothing like being in the rest
[1:10:16] of God
[1:10:18] amen all of your works is done you ain't
[1:10:20] got to worry about the future
[1:10:22] amen I was walking in the house today I
[1:10:25] said Lord I'm just so thankful that I am
[1:10:27] completely just yours I'm just
[1:10:30] completely surrendered to you Lord
[1:10:33] I'm Yours
[1:10:36] I ain't got a worry in the world
[1:10:39] not in this life and not in the world to
[1:10:41] come God is promised to take care of you
[1:10:44] we ought to be the happiest people on
[1:10:46] the face of the Earth
[1:10:47] we should be filled with the peace of
[1:10:49] God that passes understanding we should
[1:10:51] have the joy of the Lord is my strength
[1:10:54] joy unspeakable the Bible calls it and
[1:10:57] full of Glory
[1:10:59] amen that's what God's really like
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:04] hey man aren't you glad for that
[1:11:07] we'll talk about a little bit more but
[1:11:10] let me just read you the there's one
[1:11:11] scripture that I'd like to read I've got
[1:11:13] the peace and the joy and all this but
[1:11:16] you know Paul Peter says it this way
[1:11:18] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:11:20] Lord Jesus Christ this is in First Peter
[1:11:22] the first chapter verse three
[1:11:24] which according to His abundant Mercy
[1:11:27] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[1:11:30] hope
[1:11:31] amen by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:11:34] from the dead to an inheritance
[1:11:37] Incorruptible and undefiled and that
[1:11:40] passes that away
[1:11:42] pray and that fate is not away
[1:11:44] amen how many believes that's eternal
[1:11:46] life that God has promised you
[1:11:48] that you haven't inherent condom that's
[1:11:50] that's Eternal it's uncorruptable it's
[1:11:53] undefiled that faded out of the way
[1:11:56] reserved in heaven for you who are kept
[1:11:58] by the power of God through faith unto
[1:12:00] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[1:12:03] last times wherein you greatly Rejoice
[1:12:06] no now for a season in other words you
[1:12:08] might get real happy but it may be that
[1:12:11] it might be seasonal it may not always
[1:12:13] be so happy
[1:12:14] if need be ER and having us through
[1:12:17] manifold Temptations and trials and that
[1:12:21] the trial of your faith being much
[1:12:22] precious than the gold that perishes
[1:12:25] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:12:27] found unto praise and honor and Glory at
[1:12:29] the peering of Jesus Christ whom have
[1:12:31] not whom he having not seen ye love
[1:12:35] in whom though now you see him not yet
[1:12:39] believing you rejoice
[1:12:42] with joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:12:48] amen even though we don't see him yet we
[1:12:51] have joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:12:54] because we are trusting to the promises
[1:12:56] of God
[1:12:58] amen
[1:12:59] praise be to God
[1:13:01] do you know I got the thinking here
[1:13:03] people will go to Oceans they'll go to
[1:13:05] beaches
[1:13:07] Amen to see the beauty that God has made
[1:13:13] they love to see beautiful places
[1:13:19] but you know how many knows that if
[1:13:21] those places are so beautiful how
[1:13:24] beautiful is the one that has made him
[1:13:28] amen how many believe that God is
[1:13:30] beautiful
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:35] and we sing the song Not only is he
[1:13:38] beautiful but if he's in you we sing the
[1:13:41] song let the beauty of Jesus be seen in
[1:13:44] me
[1:13:46] how many believes that the beauty of
[1:13:48] Christ and seeing seeing the beauty of
[1:13:50] Christ is a whole lot better than seeing
[1:13:53] mountains oceans are all that he has
[1:13:55] made
[1:13:58] everybody that goes to beach everybody
[1:14:00] loves the beach everybody looks in the
[1:14:01] ocean that's Sunset if they just begin
[1:14:04] to think about the author
[1:14:06] think about the one that's made it but
[1:14:08] how many know the whole world is blinded
[1:14:10] about they don't look try to see
[1:14:13] they don't look and see because the
[1:14:15] Bible says their eyes are blind layout
[1:14:17] as he was blind
[1:14:19] most people are blind and they don't see
[1:14:21] what you see
[1:14:23] then the Bible say bless under your eyes
[1:14:24] for they see
[1:14:26] thank God that you can see God
[1:14:29] that you can look to him
[1:14:32] and live
[1:14:35] what do we do we look to his word
[1:14:39] because remember he said look to me all
[1:14:40] you have to be saved because my words
[1:14:42] going forth and it won't return void
[1:14:45] we look to what John 3 16 for God so
[1:14:48] loved the world that whosoever believeth
[1:14:49] him shall not perish but have
[1:14:51] everlasting life
[1:14:53] so you look to him and that's how you
[1:14:55] live you're looking right straight to
[1:14:57] that scripture what God Said and
[1:14:59] trusting in it
[1:15:01] they'll look at everything else and see
[1:15:03] the beauty but they don't see the beauty
[1:15:05] of Jesus
[1:15:07] and I asked this year and wrote down
[1:15:09] what is the beauty of God
[1:15:13] amen what is the beauty of God
[1:15:16] the beauty of God is one thing is his
[1:15:19] grace
[1:15:22] my when you think about how beautiful
[1:15:24] this craze is
[1:15:27] and his love

[1:15:38] God I gotta take this slow
[1:15:40] let's talk about his grace
[1:15:47] oh my how beautiful is it
[1:15:51] God could take in the Bible times that
[1:15:54] woman that dwell which is a harlot net
[1:15:56] right
[1:15:58] and take and take all of our sins or the
[1:16:00] one that was washing his feet I believe
[1:16:02] it is another one watching his feet and
[1:16:04] cleaning them and so forth and he told
[1:16:05] Simon you know you didn't welcome you
[1:16:08] didn't do all of these things but this
[1:16:09] woman has not ceased to it and her sins
[1:16:12] which are many
[1:16:14] all forgivener
[1:16:17] see that's true beauty
[1:16:20] how beautiful that God could take the
[1:16:22] vilest sinner
[1:16:24] make him clean like the song says oh I
[1:16:27] know
[1:16:28] yes I know
[1:16:30] Jesus blood can make the vile a sinner
[1:16:34] clean

[1:17:20] God to get some of that power to know
[1:17:22] what true power is there's power in the
[1:17:25] blood there's power in the blood there's

[1:18:24] great Beauties when you look at him is
[1:18:26] his grace
[1:18:32] his grace to forgive
[1:18:34] well maybe this is just another part of
[1:18:37] it and you know
[1:18:39] I get to thinking about his grace how
[1:18:42] did the Bible says that while we were
[1:18:43] yet sinners she died for us she loved us
[1:18:46] I love him I love him because he first
[1:18:48] loved me while I was still a sinner he
[1:18:50] loved us
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:55] how can we know I want to know this
[1:18:57] grace
[1:18:58] how many wants to know this grace
[1:19:01] well if you get the Holy Ghost
[1:19:04] the way you're going to know this grace
[1:19:06] is when somebody really really does you
[1:19:08] wrong
[1:19:10] huh
[1:19:11] and you don't get bitter at them
[1:19:14] huh
[1:19:16] they treat you terrible
[1:19:19] and you forgive your enemies you love
[1:19:21] your enemies isn't that right
[1:19:23] see grace forgives if you can do that
[1:19:26] then you know the grace of God
[1:19:30] but to be hateful and unforgiving and
[1:19:33] mean that ain't God remember if you're
[1:19:36] mean and man all of you might want to
[1:19:38] just chew somebody up for me that ain't
[1:19:39] God
[1:19:41] no turning around like Stephen did
[1:19:45] after they were stoning him forgive them
[1:19:47] don't let them charge God he knew the
[1:19:51] grace of God
[1:19:52] when you look to God you'll find them
[1:19:54] you'll know what the grace of God really
[1:19:55] is all about
[1:19:57] he'll test you he'll let you find out
[1:19:59] whether you really got the grace of God
[1:20:05] is that right
[1:20:08] amen The Works that I do shall you do
[1:20:11] also
[1:20:12] how many believe that the very same
[1:20:14] spirit that was in Christ if he dwells
[1:20:17] in your mortal body he'll still do the
[1:20:19] same works
[1:20:21] amen the love of God how many loves the
[1:20:23] love of God what a great wow how
[1:20:26] beautiful is the love of God

[1:20:31] more beautiful than the stars and the
[1:20:34] moon and the Galaxy it's more beautiful
[1:20:35] than all of these things is the love of
[1:20:37] God
[1:20:40] how rich and pure how major listen
[1:20:42] strong
[1:20:44] amen why it could forgive it's so strong
[1:20:48] that he would go to Calvary no right
[1:20:52] he showed his love when he went to
[1:20:54] Calvary and he died and he peed for
[1:20:57] everybody's sins
[1:21:00] from becanes all the way to last sinner
[1:21:02] that Everlast if it'll ever see him
[1:21:05] he paid for every bit of it
[1:21:08] oh
[1:21:09] paid for the sins of the whole world
[1:21:11] he wrote him apart and you all part and
[1:21:14] here's a here's a ticket just come and
[1:21:16] get it hand it to the officer and tell
[1:21:19] him hey I've been pardoned
[1:21:21] I can go free

[1:21:25] prison remember
[1:21:26] in the Civil War and and and his friend
[1:21:30] got him a pardon from Abraham Lincoln
[1:21:31] and get away from here and he didn't
[1:21:33] accept and they shot him dead
[1:21:35] well that's what will happen to anybody
[1:21:37] who doesn't receive it that's why on
[1:21:39] that day it isn't because he didn't love
[1:21:41] him he didn't pardon him
[1:21:44] but how deep how great
[1:21:47] is love of God
[1:21:48] amen
[1:21:50] praise the lord we can see God through
[1:21:53] prayer
[1:21:54] we can see God through trust isn't that
[1:21:57] right
[1:21:58] turn your eyes turn your eyes on Jesus
[1:22:01] the only the only way listen I've got
[1:22:04] down here the only way that if you've
[1:22:05] got a broken heart he can heal that
[1:22:07] broken heart but you got to look to him
[1:22:10] for it
[1:22:11] if you're saying if you're lost look to
[1:22:13] the Savior he'll save you but you got to
[1:22:16] look to him
[1:22:17] amen
[1:22:19] if you're sick you got to look to him
[1:22:22] for your healing
[1:22:23] look and live
[1:22:25] if you got trouble
[1:22:26] oh my if you're surrounded by the enemy
[1:22:30] looks like he's gonna take you down like
[1:22:32] your house effect
[1:22:33] I mean those Jehoshaphat he had the
[1:22:35] whole Army much bigger than him and
[1:22:37] capped around him and then you know
[1:22:38] tried to intimidate him what did he do
[1:22:40] he got his sackcloths and he went to the
[1:22:42] prayer he went to asking God and talking
[1:22:44] to God
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:48] and what did God do come on to see
[1:22:52] because he turned his eyes
[1:22:54] on him
[1:22:56] let me tell you something
[1:22:59] what in the world are you going to look
[1:23:01] at
[1:23:02] worth anything in this world
[1:23:06] the streets oh my form art it's terrible
[1:23:10] the public it's terrible folks
[1:23:13] what the devil has done
[1:23:17] it's absolutely terrible you can't look
[1:23:19] to our politics for hope
[1:23:22] you folks let me tell you something we
[1:23:24] aren't the only one America is not the
[1:23:26] only one sinking
[1:23:28] huh
[1:23:29] it's not the only one uh you know that's
[1:23:32] doomed
[1:23:34] it's the whole world is doomed
[1:23:37] they're all tied together there's no
[1:23:39] hope there you can't look there you
[1:23:41] can't look anywhere
[1:23:43] you know
[1:23:46] but you know I had to think about this
[1:23:49] if you want to see God
[1:23:52] where do you look
[1:23:55] where can you see God
[1:23:58] how about this how about in his church
[1:24:02] how about in his people
[1:24:05] when somebody shows you some kindness
[1:24:09] huh shows you some love
[1:24:12] by this shall all men know that you are
[1:24:13] my disciples and I think that's one of
[1:24:15] the I wrote down here that's one of the
[1:24:17] greatest ways that you're going to see
[1:24:18] God is when you see genuine love
[1:24:21] oh I'm not just talking about patent you
[1:24:23] on the back for all your evil
[1:24:25] now love is corrective
[1:24:28] ah
[1:24:30] somebody really loves you and they tell
[1:24:32] us it's tell you something you say well
[1:24:34] thank you for loving me enough to tell
[1:24:36] me because me most times we're just too
[1:24:38] scared to say anything to anybody
[1:24:42] amen I believe that needs to go both
[1:24:45] ways don't you if you tell somebody
[1:24:47] somebody tells you you need to be able
[1:24:49] to take it just like you give it
[1:24:51] but it's love
[1:24:53] amen and God is love and that's how
[1:24:55] we'll see it
[1:24:56] remember the Bible said we're taught
[1:24:58] that he's uh his hand these hands the
[1:25:00] only ones he had
[1:25:01] let me tell you isn't it beautiful when
[1:25:05] somebody gives you a call when you're
[1:25:06] sick
[1:25:07] or does something when you're in need
[1:25:09] they're there for you
[1:25:11] when you're down they're there for you
[1:25:13] to encourage there's nothing like it
[1:25:17] I've been there I know
[1:25:19] but it's like to have somebody when
[1:25:21] you're down at the bottom of the bottom
[1:25:22] to have somebody just say something good
[1:25:24] something positive
[1:25:27] amen
[1:25:29] that's real Beauty
[1:25:33] that's real Beauty what's the real
[1:25:37] Beauty in a church what's the beauty of
[1:25:39] a church
[1:25:41] is it our trim
[1:25:44] huh
[1:25:45] is it our carpet
[1:25:47] is it the seeds
[1:25:49] is it the nice round window thank the
[1:25:51] Lord huh we're glad for everything he
[1:25:53] gave us that's beautiful
[1:25:55] huh
[1:25:59] is it how good we look
[1:26:06] we dress
[1:26:08] oh by the way you're wondering brother
[1:26:10] what about the tie right
[1:26:12] you know what you know what let me tell
[1:26:14] you about the tie
[1:26:16] I just forgot
[1:26:20] I'd rather I got the church that I was
[1:26:22] like I forgot to put a Time
[1:26:26] the Lord I thought I had taken complete
[1:26:28] plenty of b12s but my brain still ain't
[1:26:31] looking right
[1:26:34] oh my you love the Lord
[1:26:37] the beauty of the church is the
[1:26:42] character of the people
[1:26:45] and the character of the people is
[1:26:49] the nature of Jesus Christ in them
[1:26:52] because certainly nothing beautiful in
[1:26:54] us that we would look at it's what he is
[1:26:57] in US
[1:26:58] the beauty of a church is the character
[1:27:01] of the people
[1:27:02] and that's where God place is in the
[1:27:05] people's character
[1:27:07] amen
[1:27:09] praise the Lord God is in when another
[1:27:12] way to look at is to meditate let me
[1:27:16] believe that
[1:27:17] Brother Band says in preaching and
[1:27:19] influence he says let me see what you
[1:27:21] look at watch listen to
[1:27:25] isn't that right and I can tell you what
[1:27:27] kind of person you are
[1:27:29] because we know that like he said with
[1:27:31] Abraham Lincoln the different ones are
[1:27:33] atmosphere and everything about them is
[1:27:35] created because of the things that we're
[1:27:37] looking at
[1:27:38] now David you know he was a man how many
[1:27:40] knows David was a man that believed in
[1:27:42] meditation
[1:27:43] and he and he I believe he was he put it
[1:27:46] somewhere in Psalms one you know uh I
[1:27:49] will Delight
[1:27:50] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[1:27:53] will I meditate day and night amen he
[1:27:56] shall be like a tree that's planted by
[1:27:57] the rivers of water amen
[1:28:00] to actually meditate to think about him
[1:28:03] how many knows that I wonder how many of
[1:28:06] us would say you know that's what I need
[1:28:07] to do more is keep my eyes more on him
[1:28:10] keep my meditation in the night watches
[1:28:13] and everywhere
[1:28:15] amen I don't know about you but I love
[1:28:17] to lay on my bed and just meditate on
[1:28:20] him
[1:28:21] think about him
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:32] praise be to God makes a big difference
[1:28:36] amen makes a big difference
[1:28:39] praise the Lord
[1:28:46] brothers and sisters
[1:28:48] of how good we have it
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:52] how many believe we have at nice
[1:28:55] the Lord's been good to us
[1:28:57] we have it probably better
[1:29:00] than any other age
[1:29:03] I know we easier than any other age
[1:29:07] because I think about those Dark Ages
[1:29:09] people now that they would have to hide
[1:29:11] in the catacombs and their lives were in
[1:29:14] Jeopardy for a thousand years
[1:29:17] they killed 68 million can you even
[1:29:20] fathom that
[1:29:22] through that time period they killed
[1:29:24] them in every fashion they had to sneak
[1:29:26] out and they had to be careful not to
[1:29:28] get caught
[1:29:29] and many of them would go out and just
[1:29:32] go out and confess and so forth and go
[1:29:34] out to the Gladiators and go into the
[1:29:36] lion's den or whatever and go into the
[1:29:38] arena and be killed in whatever way that
[1:29:40] it was just terrible
[1:29:42] then I think here we have it this nice
[1:29:45] huh I was thinking today brother I was
[1:29:48] thinking you know you know as good as
[1:29:50] God is every time God pours a blessing
[1:29:53] out on you it ought to cause you to
[1:29:55] praise him more
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:29:58] give me more praise
[1:30:01] amen
[1:30:04] Glory the fruit of your lips giving
[1:30:06] praise to his name and all the people
[1:30:08] said
[1:30:09] [Applause]
[1:30:12] all right God is an awesome God and all
[1:30:15] the people said
[1:30:17] we have a great heavenly father and all
[1:30:19] the people said
[1:30:21] he's our beginning and he's the author
[1:30:23] and the finisher of our faith
[1:30:26] and all the people said
[1:30:28] Sophia
[1:30:33] he's spoken it so be it
[1:30:36] so that the way that you look at God and
[1:30:39] become him by accepting him into your
[1:30:42] heart
[1:30:46] amen
[1:30:49] how many knows when brother Bannon went
[1:30:51] beyond the curtain time
[1:30:53] what did he say it felt like
[1:30:56] what did it feel like what was it like
[1:31:01] well the thing that he came back and
[1:31:04] told us that you've got to have right
[1:31:06] in order to get there
[1:31:08] he says it'll take it was just absolute
[1:31:11] perfect love there
[1:31:15] there was not one little funny feeling
[1:31:18] between one or the other all of that was
[1:31:20] gone
[1:31:25] how many knows that that isn't just for
[1:31:27] there that's for here
[1:31:29] that you can be in a place to where you
[1:31:31] don't have any funny feelings towards
[1:31:34] anybody
[1:31:36] you've got that perfect love
[1:31:42] how many wants perfect love
[1:31:44] well you just raised your hand okay
[1:31:48] now if you don't have it and you want it
[1:31:52] yes
[1:31:54] God will test you on it
[1:31:57] he'll let I'll allow things to come you
[1:31:59] away to see whether you have perfect
[1:32:01] love or not
[1:32:03] now let me just
[1:32:06] I don't want to say lie a little
[1:32:08] but do you find out whether you have
[1:32:11] perfect love when everybody's patting
[1:32:12] you on the back and being real nice to
[1:32:14] you and
[1:32:15] being good to you
[1:32:18] that's not how you find out no you find
[1:32:21] out when you get crossed
[1:32:25] remember brother Brahm says rub the
[1:32:27] kitty kitty the wrong way
[1:32:30] you find out what that cat's really all
[1:32:32] about
[1:32:35] isn't that right
[1:32:37] no brother Brandon didn't say the holy
[1:32:41] spirit said that's pink awesome hello
[1:32:44] that's why he allowed them to do that he
[1:32:46] says rub that kitty cat the wrong way
[1:32:47] and he says he didn't or that cat
[1:32:51] s ambitious big eyes teeth showing
[1:32:55] that little cat became a monster
[1:32:58] folks that shouldn't be message people
[1:33:00] that might be those but that's not
[1:33:03] message people
[1:33:06] when brother bam came back he says you
[1:33:08] know it's not let me scratch your back
[1:33:10] and you scratch mine
[1:33:12] but a man says you know if they slap you
[1:33:15] or don't scratch your back at all
[1:33:16] scratch yours anyway huh
[1:33:21] come on folks
[1:33:24] but that's what it was like being in
[1:33:26] heaven
[1:33:28] amen
[1:33:30] now how many knows in order to be know
[1:33:33] what God is by looking at him and
[1:33:34] becoming him you can't really know what
[1:33:36] God is
[1:33:37] until you have him in here
[1:33:39] you can't know what heaven's like unless
[1:33:42] you have it here
[1:33:44] amen and we're not just going to go to
[1:33:45] heaven
[1:33:47] we already have Heaven here
[1:33:50] I got a few amens out of that one
[1:33:53] amen why because the Bible says you know
[1:33:56] he was raised up from the dead and he's
[1:33:59] in Heavenly places and then later on
[1:34:01] that chapter of Egypt says as in Europe
[1:34:03] right you've been raising you're in
[1:34:05] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I'll be
[1:34:08] glad to be in Christ
[1:34:10] you are in God
[1:34:13] you can know the joy of the Lord you can
[1:34:16] know the peace of God you can know the
[1:34:18] rest of God
[1:34:19] you can know the power of God
[1:34:22] you can know the victory of God
[1:34:27] huh
[1:34:28] you know how many goddamn victory
[1:34:31] that's right the victory of God
[1:34:34] just like uh Miriam now she felt the
[1:34:37] victory when they had come over it on
[1:34:38] the other side of the uh the Red Sea and
[1:34:41] all the enemies were drunk would have
[1:34:44] felt good
[1:34:46] well let me tell you something that's
[1:34:48] the way with you and me when you
[1:34:50] overcome
[1:34:51] you experience the victory
[1:34:53] of God
[1:34:56] brother Branham actually makes a
[1:34:57] statement he says you are God's victory
[1:35:02] how many knows God's going to conquer
[1:35:04] over evil in this hour
[1:35:07] who is he conquering it through you and
[1:35:10] me you are his victory you're the ones
[1:35:13] that he's using to overcome in this hour
[1:35:17] phrase be to God I know it's a simple
[1:35:19] message but I enjoyed it when give it to
[1:35:22] me
[1:35:23] just to think about it if you look at
[1:35:24] him
[1:35:26] you still can't really know him
[1:35:28] until he comes down in here
[1:35:31] then you can really say well I know what
[1:35:33] it's like one place the Bible says no
[1:35:35] man can't call Jesus to Christ but by
[1:35:38] the Holy Ghost
[1:35:39] so you don't really know Jesus Christ
[1:35:41] unless you have the Holy Ghost then you
[1:35:44] know him
[1:35:45] you don't know the love of God unless
[1:35:48] you have the Holy Ghost inside of you
[1:35:49] you don't know peace of God unless
[1:35:51] you've got God on the inside
[1:35:55] mm-hmm
[1:35:58] how happy we should be
[1:36:00] to know that we are completely in his
[1:36:02] hands no matter what the future holds
[1:36:05] folks I'm not worried about our
[1:36:08] political system or our money system we
[1:36:10] know where it's going to end up at all
[1:36:13] in the Lake Fire
[1:36:16] but where are you going to be after that
[1:36:18] try to Fathom eternally or just a little
[1:36:20] bit he's given us eternal life
[1:36:25] more numbers that you can imagine in
[1:36:27] your mind
[1:36:29] more year numbers infinity and beyond
[1:36:33] Infinity right
[1:36:35] 100 trillion years
[1:36:41] I said because hold on folk you'll still
[1:36:44] be you'll still be enjoying God you'll
[1:36:46] still be enjoying that very peace that
[1:36:48] you got now
[1:36:50] you'll have that joy that you got now
[1:36:54] this is a good kind of test and I didn't
[1:36:56] do you really have the joy of the Lord
[1:37:01] here's a good one that comes to my mind
[1:37:03] if you drop dead right now it will
[1:37:06] change who you are and what you are
[1:37:08] you'd be exactly that on the other side
[1:37:12] if you'd be hateful and mean and
[1:37:13] unforgiving yet that's what you'd be on
[1:37:15] the other side you'd be somewhere else
[1:37:17] but if you've got the love of God in my
[1:37:19] heart huh
[1:37:22] what was it
[1:37:23] I believe brother Bannon was told one
[1:37:25] time that he was going to be lost and
[1:37:27] he's wrong you know off he's a false
[1:37:28] prophet or whatever he's not gonna make
[1:37:30] it he says you know he says and what did
[1:37:32] he say he came back and he says you know
[1:37:34] if that's what God wants me to be then
[1:37:37] that's what I want to be
[1:37:42] this is the way I feel about it that if
[1:37:45] God would cast me on here if he counts
[1:37:47] me off at the end
[1:37:49] he'd be rightfully to do so
[1:37:52] he says but I believe I would love him
[1:37:54] anyway I would love him
[1:37:57] he said if I feel
[1:37:59] if I feel like I do now
[1:38:01] huh I love him he loves him
[1:38:04] and if God cast me off I would be loving
[1:38:07] him
[1:38:08] he says I don't think you know God's not
[1:38:11] going to cast somebody like that in hell
[1:38:14] no
[1:38:15] because he loves him
[1:38:18] I was looking up this uh loving God
[1:38:21] trying to say the love of God is in our
[1:38:23] hearts you know he says the God has shed
[1:38:25] abroad in our hearts the love of God he
[1:38:27] has put God's love in our hearts and he
[1:38:30] was talking to the Pharisees he says I
[1:38:31] know your hearts he says that you do
[1:38:33] that you love not God
[1:38:36] he told them Pharisees they don't love
[1:38:38] God
[1:38:39] amen
[1:38:41] because how can you say you love God if
[1:38:43] you hate who he sends
[1:38:46] right he doesn't doesn't that's why
[1:38:49] people think well I can go to heaven
[1:38:51] without the messenger that he sent in
[1:38:52] this hour really
[1:38:55] how can you not love what God has done
[1:38:58] and what he sent
[1:38:59] if it's the truth
[1:39:01] amen
[1:39:03] praise be to God so Lord thank you Jesus
[1:39:05] for your grace thank you for your love
[1:39:07] thank you for letting us look at you and
[1:39:10] there is so much more that we'll learn
[1:39:12] Through the Ages that is come I'm gonna
[1:39:14] believe that there is so much more we
[1:39:17] could never understand you know
[1:39:20] his ways are past finding out
[1:39:24] you can look at and you could never
[1:39:25] figure out you don't even try to brother
[1:39:27] bam says don't even try to figure it out
[1:39:31] because we I was trying to think of the
[1:39:33] word on the way of how that we try to uh
[1:39:35] make everything uh figure it all out
[1:39:38] basically and and rationalize everything
[1:39:41] and and we got to have it up and all you
[1:39:44] just can't figure it out in this human
[1:39:45] mind this human mind can't comprehend it
[1:39:48] all
[1:39:48] but now you do comprehend the love of
[1:39:51] God the grace of God the joy of God the
[1:39:53] peace of God
[1:39:54] okay
[1:39:56] we don't understand how you can just say
[1:39:58] something and boom there it is
[1:40:00] huh
[1:40:02] everything comes from atoms it comes
[1:40:04] from the invisible
[1:40:06] day
[1:40:08] but those atoms and those inside those
