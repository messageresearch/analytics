this morning amen and so i know we do have a lot of sick people folks i'll tell you about the pandemic right now i think we're in the peak of it especially right around here we haven't had a real uh had it real bad up till the last couple of weeks and seems like it's certainly going around i mean not just here but everywhere amen and so amen i know a lot of it may a lot of some of it we don't notice whether unless you get tested it may not be coveted but you know and so but anyway so god bless you this morning good morning we greet you in the name of the lord i know i don't look like tom you know i thought tommy was going to come on up here you know and so we'll have him up here in a minute i told him i was having a few scriptures i'd like to go over if i could he may say a few words before amen we have him and then if we have time we can take all the time he wants and if he uses all the time up if somebody else wants to have a testimony or has a testimony i'd like to give this is going to be one of those times where we just have a good old-fashioned test testimony meeting yeah that's a talk about the lord and to talk about the things that god has done in our life and so this morning you might want to just kind of lay a foundation here this morning i will talk to you about how important it is to testify to for the lord that be okay how important that is and i want to tell you and i'll put it in jesus words here in a minute we'll read it how important he said that it was that we testify of him amen so god bless you let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you this morning thank the lord jesus that because of what you did 2 000 years ago on calvary's tree father when we bow our heads lord we can speak directly to you lord jesus of the blood of jesus christ we have fellowship with you once again lord and we have a communion with you lord jesus we can ask anything in your name and you said that you would do it so father we do thank you lord jesus different things i've done even this week lord and and and lord i was sick and i said in the name of jesus christ i claim my healing lord and i see lord jesus where i got to feel them better and i got the praying for everybody else lord in the name of jesus christ those that are not feeling well lord we know there's power in that name lord and so we ask this morning that you would touch those that are not feeling well and again in the name of jesus christ and we do thank you for those who are feeling better once again including myself lord and we just ask god that you'll bless the testimony unless every portion of the service may bring an honor and glory to your name for we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen during your bibles it was for just a few scriptures a few comments i'll tell you i was back there just looking at this in a preacher you begin to you begin to say well i better be careful i'll be up here too long so i mean there's a lot to be said here but i won't go too much amen but i do want to talk about the importance of it amen and i thought i've been thinking about testifying and confessing amen testimony testimony is like a confession amen amen and so let's go to look at what jesus said about the importance of confessing him amen and first of all uh we'll go to mark 8 we want to talk about confessing him and not being ashamed of him amen mark 8. and i think it's also luke 9. there's two scriptures of course you know that mark luke and john a lot of them say this you know tell the story maybe just a little bit different but a lot of them have the same thing in it and i want to take math marks and luke's uh scripture of what they said amen mark 8 and we'll begin with verse 36-38 it says uh mark let's go way back to verse 34 so we get the whole story and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will can come after me let him deny himself take up and follow me for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what is it profited a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul now notice he's talking about your soul he's talking about eternity and what does he say here at the end whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed now notice his last part he envelops of the whole of heaven all of his angels all right he tells you if you're ashamed of me in front of one or two people he says of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with all with the holy angels amen now over in luke luke says it also in verse chapter 9 luke chapter 9. we'll let you be seated after this and i want to speak for about 10 minutes if that be okay then we'll have the service turned over to brother tommy amen for him to give his testimony of what christ has done in his life amen verse 23 of luke 9 and he said unto them all if a man come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man prophet if he gain the whole world and lose himself and be or be cast away for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man also be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy angels amen god bless you you can be seated this morning amen praise the lord how many knows that uh it's important not to be ashamed of jesus christ amen there's a lot of people that are shy just kind of oh they don't want to say something about jesus or somebody i'll say a curse word or something and they use the lord's name in vain and you know they don't have enough maybe in them to say well you shouldn't talk like that uh-huh you shouldn't say that i don't really want to hear that you know if you want to talk like that talk to somebody else like that i don't really want to hear it you don't want the recompense of what will come with it perhaps it's just well i'll just be quiet huh or just to be a witness just to be a witness for christ sometimes people are shamed to do it you should never be ashamed to be a witness for christ and to confess him amen all right let me see here i think in luke telling luke 12 he talks about calling it a confession all right not just being ashamed but but to confess in luke 12 and verse 8 it says also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men amen in other words you're not ashamed of him and you confess the lord jesus christ he says him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god amen so in front of the whole hosts of heaven amen if you're not ashamed to confess him when he's there with all the holy angels amen he'll no doubt mention your name he won't be ashamed to say your name oh my i want you to try to imagine what it's going to be like when he's there with all of the holy angels and if the bible says he'll be ashamed of you right so i don't know just how that's going to work do you you know because you're ashamed of somebody you just kind of shrug away from them you know or maybe you would call out to god and he just said who are you just ashamed of you you know you feel real bad god he don't i don't know you you know that's a it's a it makes you feel bad if somebody acts like that target but he says he will be ashamed of you on that day if you're ashamed of him if you're not if you're ashamed to confess and if you live listen but if you do if you confess me before men him will he confess before god and all of his holy angels he won't be he won't be a ashamed to call your name and say well done your name put your name in there enter into the joys of the lord who has prepared for you from the foundation of the world come here call your name and come i'm not afraid to call your name when you're not ashamed of him amen how many knows our world our government politics everybody's ashamed of jesus they don't want no part of him they don't know want them nowhere around don't wanna mention his name our presidents they used to say god bless america they used to praise pray for america and they don't say that stuff anymore no right they hardly say that and that's a shame but folks god's people aren't like that amen we're not like that we're not afraid ashamed to confess the lord jesus christ amen quickly another one what what what paul said about it let's see what paul said in romans 10 in romans 10 and verse 8 paul says it this way what saith that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in that heart that god has raised him from the dead how many know you got to believe what jesus died that he died for you that he confessed what he did for you you're not ashamed of what christ done but confess him first of all you got to believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead and then confess it with your mouth salvation true salvation comes out through here you can't be saved and then be ashamed of him oh if you know what god has done for you're not ashamed of him you want to be a witness to everybody you want to tell everybody to know what christ has done for you how many believes that amen thou shalt now notice he says and believe in that heart god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved hallelujah so how many believes confession give it a testimony of the lord and it's part of your salvation it's part of being in heaven if you're ashamed to do that you're not ready to be a christian remember the days of jesus and the scribes the pharisees he says anybody that confesses him will be excommunicated everybody confesses christ they'd be thrown out even that man that was born blind and was opened he says you know he says he's of age ask him how he was healed because the parents knew that if they confessed him they'd get thrown out so they didn't want to confess him folks what kind of parent is that their child gets healed by their eyes they're ashamed to confess the man that was able to do this that's not much of a parent is it no i don't know about you but if my child i don't care what church i was in amen god healed him i'd say god healed him jesus healed him that's right amen thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus shall believe in the heart god has raised him from and for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation in other words it's just really not complete until you say something about i'll tell you just let everybody know the lord saved me amen god is good he's real amen not really else got salvation yet now i want to say something else and this is where i could go into a whole message and that is remember the bible says let us go without the camp bearing his reproach because don't matter what generation it is what time frame it is it is always a reproach to most of the world to confess the lord jesus christ always a reproach in other words it's a stickler it's it's it's sticky kind of remember jesus says you know my words have no place in you therefore you're not of god right my words have no place in you you can't hear me and he says you say if we'd have been in the days of the fathers we would not have been partakers of the blood of the prophets in other words back then we believe moses they said moses is our prophet abraham is our father that's what they told jesus and jesus said if abraham was your father moses your prophet you would believe me see folks it's not about just believing jesus of 2000 years ago it's about you believing jesus in your day amen amen let me tell you my confession this morning is uh is this is it's in matthew no it's in uh you see here okay let's go just a couple more can i go a little longer ah did i write it down i'm thinking it might be might be in mark no it's john 3 over here it is john 3. we want to talk about somebody that was ashamed of ashamed of christ and learned a little something now there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews and the same came to jesus in front of everybody wanting to see him no he came to him by night i can't tell nobody where i'm going can't tell who i'm have an appointment with uh came and sneaked up there the same came to jesus by night and said unto rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles set down to us except god be with him how many knows nobody can work a miracle without god being with him and you know these miracles see this opening of the blind and lazarus raising and all they did just says god's got to be with him remember jesus said if you can't believe my words believe my works they testify who i am i think brother brian read it in the scriptures talking about you know you know believe the works amen let me tell you some how many knows that that's why we're not con we're not ashamed to confess what christ did in our generation amen oh my pentecost how many knows pentecost 3 000 souls were added to them in one day in this generation jesus did 10 times that do you realize if i was to number it jesus had a ministry of three and a half years when he was here on the earth in our age he had like 25 or so years i'm not sure exactly what it is but it was it was from 33 i think to 65 or something 30 some years and miracles upon miracles from that the prophet could have never done brother branham could have never done it no we know that he could have never done it unless god was with him it was christ doing it bringing the message of this generation amen and some folks are kind of halfway a day kind of leery that i'm not people that got 13 different people raised from the dead miracles upon miracles that was not the prophet that was not a man that was christ doing it amen and i'm not sure i'm sure not could be ashamed to confess that god it was god i'm all in focus when i whenever god i know that it's god according to his word i'm all in not just part but all in amen i'm having hikes hikes i must be close to here we got some spark point on here praise the lord how many love the lord but to believe christ and what he has done in your day that's what it's all about because even jesus said you say you'd have been nah what you do with christ today is what you'd have done with him back then even so much that it's pretty strong that if you're a christian and you're led by the holy ghost you can say like first john did in chapter four and verse six he says we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us how many knows you shall know the truth and the true shall set you free my sheep they know my voice real sheep know the truth when they hear it and if the truth is in you which how many knows uh that's that's that's just the thing christ ascended but he re-descended on the day of pentecost and he never he came back can we say jesus came back to her and he is living in his people now what you do to his people you do to christ heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us and hereby know with the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you can judge a person by if the truth is presented to you and you reject it you show who you are because children of god do not reject the truth of god or the word of god they don't do it there's one thing's for sure if you're a child of god you don't live by bread alone but by you lived by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen so praise be to god so we testify of what christ has done in our generation amen and it's quite something when i think about how that the miracles that were done were hundreds of thousands times more than what jesus did remember greater works indeed shall you discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart like the woman at the well you've had five husbands and the one you're living with that happened almost every service the prophet had almost every service he would discern the thoughts and dance of the heart say that's not me that's him he's here amen see what you do with that guarantee you you'll answer for it on the day of judgment amen even the prophet god said these tapes would be played back on judgment day it's not me it's him it's his works it's his doing it's the last prophet the last messenger sent to the gentiles before the destruction of the world amen all right god bless you this morning i'm looking forward to it amen i told tommy he had a video that he sent me that i wanted to play but i think he's got it included so amen we are in for a treat and so god bless you this morning i'll stop there amen and will it uh and i apologize that's about 20 minutes 10 minutes you're up amen it's good to have everybody better timing come on up and we'll give you the floor here ever using one of these uh let's just pray dear gracious heavenly father lord we just want to come before you another day lord and pray lord that you know i'm here now lord i told you i wouldn't be scared to get up and share what you've done for me i have years of testimonies that i want to share that i should have shared a long time and i thank you for your grace that saved me lord and i just want to tell you that i want to give you 110 today and i pray that i get out of the way lord that you come feel my mouth and and feel the ears of the here's lord and be with everybody that couldn't be here lord and i pray pray you bless everyone that's here lord and in a special way lord and i i need you and i love you and i appreciate you in jesus name that man just get uh let's just give the lord a round of applause i have a foundation here that i was going to uh start with some scriptures too if y'all want to turn with me to mark 5 19. you're just going to bear with me uh i've always had a actually traced this fear it's just another testimony right here we're going to give you one right now you know i i traced this fear of getting up here in front of people uh all the way back to in school we used to have talent shows and things like that you know and uh i'm like i'm gonna sing a song you know we'll be staying at home you know i'm gonna get up here and sing song time come for audition he's singing no song you know i ain't getting up here i do anything else but i ain't getting up there and uh every time i'd get up and share or i mean i could be just talking to somebody and i'd choke up and i mean you can ask my buddy here i was the best man in his wedding supposed to give a speech and i had this big old thing that i had i was gonna say all this stuff and i get like so many lines into it and like fold the paper up and put in my back pocket start winging it and cut it like two minutes you know like my buddy just called me story time tommy because i'd make a short story long and now i can get up here i can make a long story short you know what i'm saying so just had to bear with me here and i was expecting that i told everybody in your mama too to come on out here i was trying to get it all back to the gills you know and i'll tell you why here in mark's let me see mark 5 19. i got sidetracked there just pray that the lord will uh say what he wants me to say and take out what he wants me to leave out you know he said here in 5 19 albeit jesus suffered and suffered him not but saith unto him go home and tell our friends and tell them how great things the lord had done for thee and have had compassion on the praise god you know that that just means a lot to me because i should i had that scripture a long time ago when i do that never did it that's why i said that was testimony right at the beginning you know here we are praise god conquering these fears huh go to luke 19 37 through 40. well i should probably mark my face your first for getting nervous huh i already said here he and they told him jesus of nazareth's passes by and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and they which went before rebuked him and that he should hold his peace and he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood on and commanded him to be brought unto him and said unto him he said unto him and when he was come near he asked him what oh man yeah i was on the wrong chapter there yeah okay let me get on the right jeff i mean you're gonna have it you know and when he was come now even now just bear with me all right even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice with for the almighty works that god they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh on the name of the lord peace in heaven glory in the highest and some of the pharisees from a multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples he said unto them said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would cry out immediately you know amen mark 10 27. i guess i could have kept them together mark 10 27 and jesus looking upon them saith with man it is impossible but not with god for all with god all things are possible 11 24 therefore i say unto you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them matthew 17 20 and jesus said on them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have faith as mustard faith has a grain of mustard seed you shall say it on this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you hey man i see i had broke down a few things here i got quite a bit here i'm gonna get going try to get the rust knocked off here and i said well the last time you see me i was liking feeble old man but now look i still look old but now i come into you with power from on high carrying this sword i'm not a preacher i'm just going to use scriptures throughout the book to back my stories change the mind change stories of that god can change a man and i'm a witness of that here's some fuel for my fire fuel for your fears and my fears i started thinking of that way one day i'm laying there thinking about things which i'm fixing to talk about and i was just thinking about these things and they just started really burdening me and then i start using that you know it's just power and to overcome these fears he said you know here's some fuel if you ain't making mistakes you ain't trying don't fear to fail if you get knocked down to back up you need more fuel minding your loved ones that i see hurting and in jail people's children being tormented the lost loved ones my sister i lost my and all my family and my friends and all that they've lost and my friends and their family members and all the sicknesses and the things that's crippled up people in the bed and addictions and chains and it makes me angry and it just gives me fuel ready to go to war with jesus by my side he's brought me through so much like he did david fighting and bury the lion and goliath and so i'm i've been i've invited everybody and their mama you know you go big or go home and i thought that you know laura was telling me one day it was like you know either go home go big or go home you know i was feeling like you know it's been burdening me for a night don't be you know he's done back me up by all these things he brought me through so why fear you know and uh you know if god be force who can be against us and he said in second kings here elijah prayed and said unto the lord i pray they open their eyes that they may see that the lord their their eyes of the young man he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and cherished round the fire elisha and he said you know i believe in here today that you know there's angels and everything in here today you know i said you know you can't control the hand we're dealt but we can talk to one talk to the one who can we've all come from different walks of life but i ask you to think about your life and your is your glass half full or half empty today can you see the forest for the trees or you just don't get cold and stagnant lukewarm mad or angry with god are you not or maybe you're not where you once was let's wreak in on that fire here today the power of the blood in the word ephesians 6 17 says it's the helmet and a two-wedged sword and you know it cuts coming and going the bible says and in romans 3 4 he said let god be true and every man be a liar so even though i may fail you everyone else may fail fail me and everything fails but one thing that i that don't that's my absolute that's my jesus that's this word my sword that overcomes satan anytime anywhere breaking every chain addiction breaks all chains the heels all men's all my savior my absolute my unchangeable unmovable god so no matter what you're facing today you may be needing healing deliverance a new birth experience he's the friend you need to walk by your side he you ask me how i know because he lives in me to show here's a few of my life's testimonies that he's brought me through and where i've been and where i'm going and some of what he's brought me through and i hope some of these stories inspire and lift your faith and help someone else or maybe even start your walk most of all glorify our lord god almighty because i only believe all things are possible hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and forever you know i was expecting a lot a lot more people here today but being they'll try to get them sick and bring in storms everything we're about to get more eggman's how y'all gonna get a little water here you know there you go and uh i was i'm just gonna try to lay it out i'm not good with words and my memory is really bad uh especially to get up here and if i start freezing but anyway uh i just want to kind of give a foundation in my life just a little bit of my personality as i was growing up i'm not gonna hit on a whole lot of stuff just kind of give some stuff you know get us on down the road and that makes sense why i'm where i'm at today you know as i was growing up well i i was told that you know i was born i was born prematurely i always laugh joke about this because i had things to do i'd get out here and get to work you know mama and my aunt them told me you know they seen me when i was they sneaking their house getting out they sneaking there i'm crying over the baby bed sliding down the rails you know you sp and as i was growing up you know i was just a big daredevil i'd do anything you know it didn't matter what you was doing skating biking it didn't matter i broke bones got into fights all the time you know i was self-conscious and stuff too growing up i you know we didn't have a whole lot when i was young and you know you you might have been wearing like same clothes you know had grass stains so you just start being self-conscious about that you know you just want to you just kind of want to be cool you know and fit in with everybody you know how it is in school uh and as i was growing up i had uh i had a bad temper a real bad temper and i had this chip on my shoulder from some might call it the short man cinder my color whatever you will but i had to prove to you that uh i was just tough as you was and uh you know as it didn't matter you mixed the temper with uh no fear uh you got a bad combination you could bump me look at me wrong and i would be ready to fight literally uh and i got all this full so y'all just either pray that i hurry up or take my time uh oh yeah and i then we're on down the just that temper and you know that fighting mentality you know and uh you know as you grow up and they start getting mad at things you know getting destructive punching holes through walls you know and i've always been like that and i don't know i think it's kind of molded and shaped in me though something about that fighting character i believe you know but it's just how you use it i guess but you know i progressed on and we'll get on down the line to uh as i was i don't know how over old well i was 15 when i started doing uh some drugs and drinking a little bit and you know eventually it just became fun you know because you know i wrote this dopamine down because you know back in them days we didn't know i didn't know nothing about all that and you know when you're riding bikes skating doing them things you know lifting weights any of that you get dopamines going your phone anything you're doing you're getting them dopamine going it releases you can eat food and it's a natural high that your body gets you know looking back we didn't know that you know that's why i think you know i fell into you know i just always like i guess dopamine and you know uh so uh that i put on here i was a bit of extremist you know you can probably already see that we're fixing to we're gonna probably see that by the time i get to the end of this uh i couldn't just uh get up here and just share a little testimony it seemed like i got to drag out my life story i don't know why but uh i got stories for days i even wrote that here and i got stories for days we can keep on going and on and on and on but i'll just get to some of the high points you know i remember a time that i was in high school it was my senior year and i was actually in the hallway arguing with my girlfriend at the time and this dude said something to me and uh well he said he just hit me wrong you know and like i said my temper never hurt i'm already fighting anyway then you you had on run your mouth and i went down there and anyway make a long story short when you're getting on big detail but we've about gotten a big fight got tackled by the vice principal you know get suspended from school and everything and i come back and when i come back from school he told me you know i was going to be in school suspension i'm like no i'm not going to be in school suspension and he was like yeah blah blah blah there you are and i got all mad and got in his face and put poking him in the face and thing and he said you know what i quit so i went out the door broke the daggone door off the thing upper and they said you ain't going nowhere we're calling the law i'm like i just quit 18 years old it's done and so you know after doing that you know that was a stupid mistake kids stay in school you know after all that you know i was uh going through you know working i was working at arby's at the time and just doing what teenagers do riding around being stupid and everything and i was thinking about my life and you know thinking about like my grandpa and you know my both my grandpa's they served in the air force in the navy and i thought you know i'm gonna go join army you know me and my buddy we went up there and was talking to them at the recruiting office and everything and i was told at the time marines were the baddest so i want to go be the baddest i'm talking to these guys you know i'm like anyway we was getting everything together and i pretty much done everything signed a dotted line and i was like i left and everything and we'll come find out now navy seals what i hear is about us guys but anyway uh you know god had a different plan for me and uh you know i had done her tough lessons tough life lessons you know i told joe the night before this night i said because he he got hurt and got a little settlement or whatever and was riding around his cool truck and i'm like man i wish i'd get hurt and get some money like you and the next day i was at arby's you know be careful what you wish for i was at arby's and uh the drunk driver came through the building and hit them grease fryers and uh you're gonna put the pictures up uh hit the grease fryers and when it not it hit me about cut me in half right here where it hit and the grease fires hit the thing hit me in the head knocked me down and i'm trying to get up and everything it's got grease all over me i'm trying to go out the back door and then a uh the dude nails it in reverse comes around plows the rb sign about kills me a second time right there within minutes i mean seconds probably and i'm standing there then ripping my clothes off and all my skin's just falling off my arms and everything pretty unimaginable but anyway you know and you know i say all that to say you know if i hadn't made stupid choices for one quit in school i would have been in school that day i would have been standing there where i was at you know but uh you know the good lord works in mysterious ways you know i got a uh and i remember one time i they told me in the hospital you know i was gonna be like a millionaire you know you're like oh man i mean i'm looking at magazines like i'm gonna buy the cadillac or this denali i don't know you know what i'm saying i'm gonna get all this stuff you know i'm thinking and then then one night i was laying there and i remember i won't forget i was just crying my heart out facing the pill i don't know why but i was thinking you know nobody's ever going to love me now for me they're just going to love me for the money you know or because my scars you know and i just cried and picked my head up my pillow was just soaked in blood and i was just like you know i just wanted to forget that that was just something to me you know that i thought you know nobody's ever going to love me you know but jesus christ loves me and that's all that matters and then my wife my wonderful wife you know i mean wow she's got a powerful testimony too i mean everything i put her through you can only imagine we'll get to that here shortly but you know she loves me is where i was going with that praise god i got a settlement you know i still got the old black truck that i bought from it in the couch and stuff a few things but at the end of the day i run through the money we was having fun i was young i looked back behind 20. you know i learned that uh money won't buy you happiness you know cause i had a pretty good little chunk at that time and uh uh we should do the same things if he's gonna do all this do all that didn't even do it all we did was ride the roads get drunk get out did the same things it was some doping means you know then you start realizing you got an addiction you got a problem you know and uh because you start growing up a little bit you know and uh but uh i i won't forget this time too it's pretty crazy story i was riding in the car i bought i bought this car and uh it's pretty cool i had it tricked out a little bit and i'm going down the road i was going to see my buddy actually he was getting off work i'm going down the road this is how god works in mysterious ways i mean you know and i thank god for the courage it gives me in life you know because it's it's helped me tremendously in things and it's helped me uh do and accomplish a lot of things a lot of people couldn't but uh i i won't forget this either i'm i'm driving out through her this car comes rolling up on me speeding up on me and it looks like i remember this at that time it was like a little jeep cherokee sheriff's truck and russell i thought oh my gosh he's fixing it i'm fixing to get hit here he comes and i slow down and pull over and you know forget you know this is a lot of years ago i try to do the best i can to tell a story if i say it wrong lord forgive me about any story i say for that matter uh but i'm going down through her and i pull over and they they pulled in front of me and i see then it wasn't a cop car i'm like that's weird so then i keep going i keep going i'm driving out there they pull back up beside me this guy is leaning out the thing with like a big old pipe wrench and something and i'm like and it was a bunch of them you know i'm not by myself and i had this fake it was like an aerosol pistol i pulled it up by the side dude pulls up a gun i'm like god i hit the brakes they get in front of me they whip it over in front of me they throw something out the window i don't know what it was but it looked like a cloud of smoke and i'm like you know i'm bobbing and waving to go around that and i'm going out there and i'm flying i'm going and i'm like these freaking idiots i think they're trying to carjack my car so i'm nil on it and i blow their doors i get all the way down and i hit the e-brake whip it around uh in the middle of the road under uh caution lights and islands and there's where the courage comes in because i come flying right back at them dead center road i'm so mad i don't care i'm we're going to hit you know they ran off the road it was funny but you know thank god he was with me then too even when i was doing wrong you know and gave me the courage to do something like that because they probably all them guys they're probably going to rough me up and take my car that'll kill me who knows you know but uh that's just funny time i don't want to forget that nobody's there to witness it but jesus and uh it goes even further than that but we ain't got to go through all that part of me wants to but i'm bad about dragging a lot of stories uh that's what happens see and i have a sense of humor and a lot of times i could never get up here and loosen up with him so i'm trying to loosen up with it so you'll just bear with me on that too me and my friends we had roommates we all were running around and everything then i wound up getting in a relationship and kind of slowed me down a little bit you know being now that i'm kind of dating blah blah blah and then you know one day i was asked to go to church i hadn't been in church in a long time i went a few times with my dad and every now and then with a buddy and uh my grandpa would take me and and stuff like that and uh some of my friends every now and then i'd go with them to different churches and then i was like alright yeah i'll go i ain't been in a while you know and uh i was there i won't i won't forget you know because i i this point in my life people talk about god i ain't gonna hear you know what i'm saying i'm gonna talk about it i ain't gonna talk about it that's just the way i was you know i mean i lived wild and i mean i mean i just remember even like talking about church girl i was like i don't even want no church girl you know i don't even want a good girl back then you know and you just think of your personality how i was but uh i'm like i go to church anyway i'm in church i'm up there and i won't forget god just start you know how god does sometimes he starts speaking through you somehow with things and you're just like you feel like he's talking straight to you and i thought it was so weird you know what i'm saying and uh i remember this guy getting up her guitar and i'm like oh my gosh here this guy goes you know and he gets up there and actually wouldn't say it but he was colored guy you know but back then i was thinking you know i can't believe this guy gonna get up for a guitar you know kind of racial back in a little bit sometimes and uh uh i ain't today and uh he sung his heart out man and it was awesome it was touched me you know and uh god just kept dealing with me anyway and i just ignored it kept pushing it back it's fine whatever i leave i'm going down the road and i ain't even kidding you god is my witness you can believe me you don't have to and it was as though audible voice which was probably not audible or she would have heard it but it was though his audible voice said you're walking away from god i just kept on driving i'm like and they just hit me man i just started bawling i turned i turned the truck around i said i got to go back i got to go back i gotta go find that preacher i gotta go talk to him you know i didn't know what was happening you know and i go back and that guy sit there and led me to the lord and that day from that day on never been the same it changed my life in a noticeable way i i no more did things that i i normally did i was shying away from things that i never would have you know it was a new birth experience and i remember i was building i built the cross out of nowhere i built this cross and wrote on the back of it god is love where'd that come from i like to think now that it was like he punched the devil right in the mouth you know what i'm saying huh yeah that's what i like to think but uh uh but i was telling all my friends about it and everything and and uh how long have i been up here five minutes oh that's good he made it to 12 30 maybe i can get there oh yeah i was just i was sharing it with my friends and all the time you know you had that fire now something bubbling inside of you that i'm sure and you know it's it just has to but you know in time it was you know i was living with friends and you know with roommates and you know i just kind of slowly you know i went against that still small voice that don't do it you know i and i did it next thing you know i'm back to where i was before i gave my heart to the lord but then i became worse then i became even real jealous even more even controlling and you know whether it wound up ending my relationship you know because of how i was and then i go on i go on for years and years uh pretty wild you know drugs and temper and getting in trouble and you know especially put on there you know mixing no fear with drugs and alcohol and temper now we really have a recipe for disaster got me in a lot of trouble uh i went now went running for years back wide open backwards for a long time you know in proverbs 13 5 it says the way of a transgressor is hard and i can tell you it is and james 1 8 a double-minded man is unstable in his ways and i can't describe literally how many times god has saved my life you know i mean it's uncountable i mean that's why i said i'm just trying to get some high points just a few things that you know a few stories here and there lay a foundation but i mean we couldn't write enough books in here for all what he's done for me uh and then one night i was i've been riding around with some friends i got home they dropped me off i got on my motorcycle and i'm like i'm gonna go for a ride you know i ride you know and i was always a show off too i'd like to show off and it just gave me cur even more courage you know you know how we are we gotta you gotta jump off the high truck up here you know what i'm saying it's just what it's just how it is you know and uh so i i'm riding my bike and i blow their doors past them and uh you know i'm drunk and i get down the road and i do donut and i'm coming back up at the end of the road they're coming up the hill and i see their lights and i'm like because i know that road and i'm like oh man i hope they ain't right in the middle or something you know a lot of hitting me head on so i kind of hugged the right and when i did they passed me and then i went down the road kind of done this and i went back looking hindsight you know and i must have went off in the grass right there because it was a straight shot because the road curved so when i was hooking that right side i went off came back on where the barn you know they'll do the blacktop and kind of be a little pull in came back on there in front of the barn window flipping my motorcycle and everything down through here didn't really know nothing i woke up the next morning i mean mouth so swelled up couldn't hardly talk uh now i know i was dislocated shoulder i'm walking got one shoe long and i'm like i mean it's just sun just now coming up and uh i'm like what in the world you don't even know what's happened here and i'm like oh my gosh i see my bike shine chrome on i'm like i don't wreck my motorcycle and uh i go over to i'm like i'm gonna try to lamp at home bars all bent down and everything i said well maybe i can still limp at home i go to pick it up and i'm gonna try to start the keys were in my pocket so i don't know how that happened but i don't know if i tried to ride it again at night or what and the world happened but i guess i had passed back out and then my dad come and he found me he and it tore him all up because he look he thought i was going to be dead and the way i looked and everything and you know being backslidden and where i was at you know all along when you backslide on god you always want to do a little better but then you're always beating yourself up because you're not then you're always not doing better and you snowball you know what i'm saying and uh so now i'm all jacked up black eyes everything else i'm like man lord when i get healed up i'm gonna go to church and i came to this church before one time i thought man a bunch of weirdos over here i ain't going and i was like uh that's what i thought but you know by god's grace he buried with me didn't he uh i'm like when i get healed up and this black guy ain't like it i'll go i'm gonna go to church so i go to my buddy joe's church i come you know here's a good service and uh standing out there in the parking lot and i see tammy i see you're over i'm like you know that's a pretty pretty girl there you know later on like two weeks goes on i can't quit thinking about this girl and uh i asked josh or melanie and i'm like what's what's that girl's number what she you know try to get her number for me you know they get her number in their hand we start talking or whatever and uh see that was good we went off no no see oh yeah i couldn't quit talking about her and uh got her number we talked for a while you know on the phone and stuff like that and then i took her on first date being extreme as i am we're not just going to do something normal i'll take her to pilot rock we climb up there just said stars because it's so beautiful and beautiful to talk you know i love about rock it's so pretty up here especially at night time and we dated for a while and you know you can ask signs from god sometimes you can ask him for maybe something and it might be really weird i've asked for really weird things and not even got him this was one of them i was praying i had been praying when i meet the right one sometimes i go sit on my front porch out of my old trailer i'd sit there and there was this fork in this tree i slept three fallen stars fall right there you know that's a weird thing to ask and i'm talking to her on the phone sitting there and all of a sudden i see all three i'm like well that was weird i don't know that was just a coincidence i guess you know you're thinking man wow i don't know but anyway you know things that happened and you know i started getting a little jealous just a little bit i don't know why sometimes looking back in my life the only time i ever got a little jealous is when i really cared about somebody i don't know if it was just afraid of getting hurt or what it was but uh only the couple girls i really cared about i'd get like it so then i started getting like it hurt and i thought you know what i i ain't doing this again and i was actually thinking about uh breaking up just because of how i was i didn't want to be that way and you know god had other plans and you know it ended up working out and we end up just kept on dating everything but uh as it progressed of course i got to where i was really way more control and then i started drinking a lot more and then then you know the drinking was fun you know you do things and you know whatever but one of the train you know beer they say got a good acquired taste uh it wasn't i didn't i didn't care that much about it a whole lot until one morning i drank one morning and i drink one morning and i look back and that was life changing there uh i started drinking all day you know i look back i think a lot of it you you're trying to well at that time uh i mean i'm partying drinking still like normal you know just not as bad as i was and uh because i'm still you know we're dating everything and we got married and yada yada uh then we end up having our son lyric say some prayers for him he's sick they're getting bigger today you know and uh uh deep brain freezer where's it going with that now let's get off my nose here huh oh you're quite a few times oh yeah the morning drinking well once that happened man you know it turned from being just for more fun and you know because you're growing up responsibilities are starting to add up things you need to be doing is adding up you're not taking care of them you're still acting like you're 18 years old you know and uh but i start drinking in the morning i think then you kind of now you know you take it first drink in the morning i mean seven o'clock i'd pop the top by six o'clock i'd have six back in me and i mean it was crazy but i was a functional drunk you know which i thought i was anyway uh thought i could do about anything doing it i became where i felt more normal drunk than i was normal and uh you know dragged that out but that morning where i'm trying to emphasize on that that's when it changed my life on drinking to where now i really rely on it daily because then you know i mean day in and day out i'd be uh i'd be leaving work leave my responsibility not taking care of the things i should be taking care of and uh you know became a full-time job feeding my addiction it ruled me ruled over my life you know i even got to work because you know you backslide like i said and you do and that i got to where i was such a debbie downer or negative nancy whatever you want to call it you know friends i started pushing my friends away because you know i'll be doing bad but then you know over time i'm gonna quit i'm gonna quit i'm gonna do good you know i want to do better i'm gonna do better than that like i don't hear that crap all the time you know and you're just like man you know you want to do better and it's just it's hard you know when you're when you're stuck in an addiction control in your life the devil you know you know and just fighting and bickering with them all the time i was just living a hypocrite life you know uh you know i i remember times that i had guns pulled on me multiple times i should have had a couple bullets in the head you know i remember one time i was at a stop light me and tammy we pull up in this dog talk about my temper i pull up his stop like this guy's in my bumper i keep looking back and forth he just he's just right there in my bumper i'm getting frustrated i'm like all right man if he get i'm gonna pull up i pull it up a little more if he gets my bumper again all right he pulls up or he does that i wave him over i get over here i get it i get up her door trying to get my truck he won't get out of truck he's old ladies crying got the kid in the back i got my wife and son in a car seat over here and i'm trying to yank him out truck he pulls gun up pointing it at me there and i'm still trying to get him out he won't get out of the truck you know what what if he would have shot me he could bible kill my wife or son too you know you just never know man it's crazy when you're out there doing running wild like that but uh all along here i've been building a rap sheet a mile long you know and it's just anyway we ain't gonna get into all that but then i went on that probably went on about five months really just just a crazy man you know if it weren't for jesus i i'd be someone i'd be on some old show which i've literally i've seen these shows of these guys that got jealous on like snap you know they've snapped you know got jealous and this and that and killed their old lady you know controlling couldn't take it no more winds up sniping you know everything that guy talked about and everything they i had all them signs i was a guy you know i'm saying i would have been a murderer just like you hear it's crazy but that's just the lord jesus held me back from going too far praise god you know in in that time of just full-blown madness man i mean it literally was madness you know it was so much devil trying to i'll be bringing it home shortly about you know but so many devils with that jealousy spirit that controlled my life and then in turn and controlled her and then ruined everybody's life around me because you know she can't even have a good time know where she goes because i'm all jealous and trying to control everything and i can't have fun here because i mean i'm telling these jealousy spirits it's it's a rough devil play in some of the places i've been and addictions and the things i've seen outside of jesus rarely do they come back i've been down the bottom of the pits of hell and seen things and done things that you know is plumb just nasty you know what i'm saying and you know dope what it stands for death or prison eventually that was that was the road i was on if it wasn't for jesus you know and uh he kept me all along the way uh i felt like paul in romans there 7 15 says that which i do i allow not for that i would that i do i i do not but what i hate that i do you know i'm saying that to me when i was in that spot i'm over here keep feeding my addiction i'm doing what i don't want to do i want to be doing right reading and going to church doing the right things but i'm not doing it that's how i interpret it and you know it meant something for me because i'm you know that's a scripture hitting home for me at that time you know uh i still did good things you know when you're backslidden you know you i still had a good heart and wanted to help people i made stands for people you know i remember times where people was about to go rob people and stuff and you know i stood up and wouldn't let it happen you know who knows what could have happened in the middle of getting robbed especially knowing you know i'm saying you look back like wow you know but all along that was just god's anchor holding me it wasn't me holding him i was always running against him you know but you you're either serving the devil or god our lives our fruits like that song you might drink whiskey you might drink wine you're gonna serve somebody you know every dot every day every choice every either for god or the devil it's faith or doubt that's the way i look at it you know and i like to back things up with the scripture everything that we can read and feed and believe it's all right here you know that's all we need right here you know matthew 6 24 says no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other yet you cannot serve god and mammon the world or the devil base based upon your own condition convictions that's what's right or wrong in your own eyes you know in this word if you find it in a word uh but praise god for his grace that that it never fails us daily and we judge ourselves daily as christians you know like paul said i must repent daily because we're all going to make mistakes every day and there's no sin greater than the neck so i must repent as he did you know i got to a real miserable state in life i was very violent with everyone my wife she wanted to leave me you know we can talk about them times now and part of her testimony is she just about wished i was dead you know she she was so sick of me and the way i was and she she wanted she wanted out she even prayed bad things some of them happened and and she still stayed with me what was that that was god's mercy and grace holding her with me praise god for that you know i got to a crazy spot there and i was going crazy and caleb was actually working with me at the time i think that's so crazy i mean i was bipolar on a whole another level jackal and i you never know you're gonna get well i was a good guy a good day or a bad day uh i could flip a script like that and i just end up quitting my job i ask him i'm like man would you just go get my toes i called dude up here and we're always doing all our flat but anyway caleb went picked up my tools for me and uh that was the end of that up there and then i just go full-blown crazy for i think it's about a year i was running a while really no job just doing whatever you know i've been doing whatever for the dope man too you know it didn't matter and i got to a spot in my life i was so sick and tired of being sick and tired you know i'll just be praying you know i'd be praying god heal me or kill me that's just where my prayer got you know i was ready to just you know that's bold statement you know especially you know not being where he's supposed to be what if he did kill me you know i've been in hell right now but it's another saving grace that he saved me through that you know but it was it was a time there that uh i'd get i remember i was so hopeless and crying i mean i was barely crying this is one of the major points in my life i remember i was there in the gravel crying balled up soaking wet crying mad at god you could have changed anything you could have done anything at any time all i wanted to be was a good husband and a good dad and you know i'm over here you know i'm addicted to everything and you you name it and i was just so low i didn't quit my job pretty much had nothing my wife wanted to leave me half time i'm telling them to stay at her mamas and daddies because you know i've done high up i don't need to be around i don't want her or my kid around me and i'm laying there in the driveway just crying the bottom of my heart all out and something just came over me that i didn't have nothing else left but hope and then i just began to laugh and cry and stood up and just praise god for that hope that's all i had there and it was it was something that carried me on through through another day you know and you know then one day me and uh uh me and buddy was working doing tile i'd actually gave him my motorcycle because i was so such an idiot you know over here i don't even have no license i'm riding a motorcycle all the time driving and driving i'm like man you can have this thing get it away from me because i'm going to get on it ever since i did so i give him the motorcycle and then then we're over here me and tammy had been fighting this day and uh i was working with brian i'm like i was driving my box truck i'm like i'm just gonna come sleep in your driveway more i was done i was done hammered i'm like i'm gonna sleep in your driveway i won't ever make it to work tomorrow we got a big old tile job i get over i just pull up in a driveway or on the way there or whatever i realize my motorcycle's over there and i'm fixing to go see tammy i get there pull up my telling he's like no man you don't need to go nowhere you can stay here stay in the house i'm like nah i'll just sleep in my box truck it's fine whatever i'm slipping back there trying to get a motorcycle tammy i'm like i'm gonna come see you i'm sorry i love you you know i'm fixing to come see you and it's like i almost thought i heard her saying no no and i hung the phone up started my motorcycle and uh i get over to franklin and as i get over to franklin i come up to this stop light i'm sitting there and i see this cop i'm like oh my gosh because i ain't even got no plates on here i'm like cop right there looking at me i pull on out i'm going out through her here he comes he's looking he's behind me i'm look back a little bit i'm like oh my gosh uh i'll drop a hammer and drop him down get on it flying down through her blow through some four ways go down i i whip around that at that time my break barely even marked the other brake lights and i whip it around come back around all i hear is just tires fixing it i dodged him and he about plows me in the cop car and i'm hammering back down through her i'm like i gotta get to the 100 you know i don't even know these roads over here and i'm like i get back to 100. i'm flying out there i'm going i see a truck uh 100 pointing that way i'm like all right so i blow through that four-way go down and i'm dr i'm like no that was not the 100 it turns out that was the truck route 100. it's in my sign that was god helping me out though if i'd made that left turn i probably would have wound up killing myself on the 100 the road i live on now i would have probably probably would have got me that night but anyway uh i'm going i remember dragging sparks man i about lay it down taking this wide turn i'm flying down through here now and this is just god's grace being with me you know i'm flying down through there and i mean dude i ain't kidding y'all look back and there's like five cop cars they're chasing me uh it's a line of traffic far as you can see and i just hit the middle line i'm parking cars cars are just parking out on my way i remember one time a hummer about plowed my mirror and i kept going i'm like i gotta get turned back around i gotta get going back to where i was where i know the roads are and i thought i'm coming up to the city i'm going down through here and uh it wasn't the city it was the interstate so i didn't see the interstate yet but i'm like i'm gonna turn around i got to pull in this hotel when i did it done me like this i do like a tanks i've ever hit all all the cop cars come flying in there and when they came in i just end up you know i'm hit now i'm laid down and they all on me cop tells me he was going to shoot me for sure if i got up and even tried to run and uh we're talking all the way you know and everything else and uh i say all that crazy story to show you that when i got bailed out and i was going through a pre-trial and everything i was having to take drug tests they were doing everything they took me going through the pre-trial before my final sense and you know and i actually started doing a little bit better and uh because like i said i'd been struggling real bad with drinking and everything but with a drug test and everything i'm uh doing a little bit better and uh i'm coming up the final sense and and me and her getting this argument that day it's like three or four days before it and i'm like we're going to my mom's and we're over there and then uh i get frustrated next thing you know i'm going to my butt it's going to walk i'll leave i i get out there this is how funny i'm tying all this together you'll get in a minute but when i leave i just crested the hill there just below mom and dad's and this car comes he's like you can ride on my head and then dad ends up coming looking for me and uh i wasn't there they dropped me off at the end of the road i'm walking down the road i'm i'm wearing overalls no shoes no shirt i'm walking out there i'm just like seeing stars you know it's pretty nice you know and uh here comes this cop car i knew a cop car sound a million times have i got away by even just hearing that sound i ain't kidding it got hidden or something and uh i heard it and i didn't think nothing ain't doing nothing wrong he's like yeah well we got calls about some guy that probably was drunk walking down the road he gets me in the car i'm like man i could have been driving doing anything you just take me i just live right over here i was like just take me home he's like no we're going to take you to jail tonight he said you're going to get a pi i got all mad at him and start making a big deal out of it anyway i ended up getting terroristic threatening then so the terroristic threatening if i hadn't run my mouth ought to sign myself out of jail next morning for pi but now that i have added this charge now i'm now i'm going to be in jail for a bit so uh now what what's happening now now i'm fixing to go to my final sentence and uh all dressed up in a jumpsuit and uh handcuffs so that really looks good to your judge that you're coming to try to beg for mercy for you know you coming uh with some new charges but it was a major turning point in my life uh 10 after got 20 more minutes it was a major turning point in my life for the first month was it was hard but uh you know it was hard and i was sick man i was it was so hard at first when i was in jail i just wanted to be free you know it's now all the jealousy and controlling that i'm talking about now is stripped from you you have zero control you can't get no drugs you can't get nothing you ain't doing nothing and you just you know it's a whole other level of uh humbling and uh you just want to be free you know i mean not to look at the sun and the moon you know when we'd be doing stuff and it just makes me sick i want to be free but i hit a point where this guy you know he speaks mysterious ways but this guy i just actually heard him saying over here he's like you know someone lives and fair tries to control everyone around them and uh i thought uh you know that just kind of hit home at me i'm like i guess that's right you know what i'm saying and but i remember rolling over one night rolling over in my bed crying barely crying i had to kind of cover myself up because you didn't look like no punk in jail you know what i'm saying and uh i'm laying her crying and the same thing i'm like you could have changed me you could have done anything at any time and basically at the end of it said so now you're blaming god and then it hit me and i just started crying i'm sorry i'm sorry lord it's all my fault i did it it's my fault and we made it through that night and the next morning i ain't getting you open a bible oh i was needing something from god this is where we start really turning i needed something from god and i turn the page open it up it's uh my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength isn't my grace is first my grace is sufficient for thee therefore uh what do you say here i'm getting all confused and embarrassed up here now i feel like i'm sorry for holding on so long i'm gonna get to the meat and potatoes here shortly uh my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect and weakness yeah therefore most gladly therefore i will rather glory in my harmonies that the power of christ may rest upon me you know and then i i know that i know it by heart but i just couldn't say it right now i've choked up but then then i flipped again and when i flipped again it landed on the scripture john 4 18 said there's no fear and perfect love for perfect love casts without fear remember i just told you he's dealing with me on fear already you know and it was like that night i was laying there and or the day i was he was dealing with me with what he said and then i was thinking on my life i thought i was always you know just no fear you know i mean i had got a stupid tattoo one time and put that on my body thinking that you know i had no fear but he started dealing with me and giving me the revelation that all along i had fear all along i had more fear of like if it was to fight someone it didn't matter i'd bite you i had more fear looking like a pump than i did of getting whooped you know what i'm saying so i took that fear and i'd rather just fight you and then sit here and get whooped you know and it was like he gave me a revelation of that that all along i had fear you know it was just a different way uh you could probably switch to that other picture back here it'd probably be better for you than my ugly face upper i see it back there now uh but anyway yeah that day i got a breakthrough and i mean i was writing scripture down and i was reading and feeding all the time these guys was like man if you lift with weights as much as you read that bible and i'm like nah i i just kept on reading this bible i was right every time i got verse i liked i'd write it down i had a notebook full of pages of just notes and everything i said but my doc my desire had been changed i no longer was jealous anymore i knew god had done work that day that night when i confessed to him that it was my fault now i'm accepting my responsibilities i played the blame game on my wife my my family my everybody around me my friend when there was nobody else to blame i was blaming god but then when i accepted my responsibility that it was my fault something happened right there and i ain't been i ain't been the same since then he set me free from drugs and alcohol and addiction and uh april 29th i'll have 11 years free from those drugs and alcohol and that lifestyle and he delivered me from jealous and temper and many more but you know uh well time was still hardy even though i had a break through you know i was just wanting to get out and you couldn't wait to get out everybody said told my wife people like me don't change you know and you know something doesn't happen in here now you're trying to convince her she was barely hanging on by a thread this is my last chance with her she was done and uh she done told me this is it and uh uh but god had done you know and i noticed a significant change in me first times ever i remember on the inside you know something happened there was this guy there he was from hazard we lifted weights and stuff together and you always hear stories about these guys from hazard they're bad guys you know blah blah blah he he like picking around with people but you know he's he'd be one of them guys to be ready to throw down any second you know and uh he kept messing with my chair and i'm like sitting there cuz like a i said i i just soon get up and we'll fight about it whatever but i was sitting there and i remember thinking oh lord just help me i don't want to fight i don't want to get no more trouble cause i you know been in all kinds of trouble i'm sitting there and he's helping me and this dude kicks my chair again i look back and i'm like don't you kick my chair again we're in here he's actually in church because where he's kicking my chair i said we're in here supposed to be worshipping god kid you're not he never touched my chair again never said anything out of the way to me again that was god coming on scene showing me that he was there with me that he would take care of it for me and you know i remember uh i was in drug court they and they i ended up getting shocked out going through a drug court program and uh uh when i was going through all that i had to go through it and that's 78 fail rate when i was going through that but you know praise god uh wait wait we completed all that it was 18 months and they changed it to 24 months you know and i've seen i've seen the fail rate i've seen all them i mean there's dudes in there offering me meth and everything else when i was in there uh you know it was anyway but you know and then i was i was proving god's word it's humbling me and you know god has a sense of humor too because i'm a big motorcycle rider and uh now i don't want to be such a burden on my wife i want to do better i wound up i have to get this moped because now i got no driver's license and uh i thought you know i'm riding the moped now i feel like i said this is what the mennonites feel like you know when they're riding horse and buggy i'm going slow and everything and uh but you know it's really funny story i won't forget either be careful what you say because i was sitting there drug court one night everybody's leaving you know and i'm a nice guy everybody i'm like uh this guy he's like man my riding i'm like i said well i mean if you really need to i can give you a ride oh yeah yeah nope yeah i don't arrive like oh my gosh man i'm right now i got this guy on the back of my mom i'm like put your hands back there and where you live at and where we're going he lived of course i had to go straight to the middle of town the other side i'm like oh my god god has a sense of humor you know then uh i won't forget either too when i was sitting there uh glorifying the lord in these meetings and stuff you know and i'm in there praising god and stuff and then you know meetings i had to go to all i mean losers having to do three and four a week and uh mandatory plus all the other classes and wound up having to do ged classes and everything else and uh i wound up getting my ged too and uh but uh i remember yeah i had a guy come to me and tell me that uh uh you know n-a-n-a-a we're not going to church just like when i go to church and i i'm not going to bring my naa books there i'm high because see they want to say that you know that's their higher power but you know that ain't my higher power my iron parts jesus christ want to set me free and i'm gonna glorify him you know so i'll be talking about him they ain't like that you know funny thing is that i was out there too one time i heard a guy where i heard these guys are the leaders that i was actually man you're talking full of knowledge you know you're like man they got it going on you know and then i i was just over here doing something was waiting on class and he's dropping kind of you know you just heard them talking and i'm like my goodness see that's what we're following and they was talking all kinds of nasty stuff and i'm like this is what we gotta listen to the leaders you know what i mean you know because you know coming from you know you want the good lord's advice not some of my hand because then over here you know they don't even know that's pretty hypocritical and anyway all them guys they all wind up backslidden and back strung out and some of them was already older at that time but you know and a few more stories here and i'm gonna be getting through here shortly uh uh you know i remember too you know just like the the drug court and fighting thing you know uh when you move over and you go to jail or you go to a new town you know you got no reputation people around your town where you're from they know you they know your character how you are fighting everything else you go there you know you got to start all the way over you know people don't know you and so you kind of feel like you know people mistake your kindness for weakness you know and uh i had multiple times the same thing that happened to me in jail a couple times that i went home there wasn't like no confrontation but it was things that was really getting to me and i was fixing explode prayed about it and i said if it happens again tomorrow i'm sorry lord i'll be thrown down and that they don't ever happen again you know before i tuck it compulsively and wound up you know in trouble but that was god for me that was meant something because like i said that's why i like the foundation of the stuff that i've done all my life and how it was he come in and changed that you see and that he can do whatever you need help with the lord can help you with i said here i'm so blessed to have my wife and you know we could go on for testimonies for days for her too she she don't like when i talk about her she won't leave that all the way up but uh you know i love her and bless your heart and uh so you know uh yeah so i go on for years now that i'm out and all that you know we get through all that but you know it's easy to grow stagnant complacent with god you know uh you just get to a spot you know we've all been there surely if not be praying for me but uh i won't forget this is a good good time right here was uh i struggled with cigarette smoking for 19 years i was sitting either where mama is or tammy is right now and uh i've been struggling i've been wanting to quit you know for a long time won't quit you know and i'd rather probably pray for him a million times and uh everything else and i'm sitting there this song comes on this older gentleman and his wife singing it was it was titled mercy walked in we're sitting there and god first dealing with me and he's like uh i can't quit today i had my reasons he's like he said you can uh just hang out and he tells me just with like faith and i'm like okay and i'm like he said something i forgot what it was exactly right now uh anyway i said i will something comes over me like i knew right then yeah i just been set free set me free right there i ain't smoking like three years and uh it happened right there you know god can use music and use multiple things to get to you you know uh and i said here i've heard people following a rut go back and forth back and forth you know that whole stagnant thing i was talking about but you know hebrews 12 2 says looking to unto jesus our author and finisher of our faith you know then i just have a little testimony in colorado here uh well was there uh up there in colorado this is where god was dealing with me uh when i went out there we went out there and i've been out to colorado i think it was fourth time this time and me and tammy this first time she had went weed went up we drove actually i i timed it on the way down just curious how long it was but it was an hour and a half up this mountain how far we went we was 10 000 feet elevation there where we set up base camp and uh i'd been up here i'd been up i'd been up higher than that never had no issues and see i got there that night we laying there and uh i don't know what happened next thing you know i'm struggling to breathe and this goes on i'm like you know that was weird and uh anyway i could not go to sleep she's over sleeping a little bit and every time i those uh my body would wake me up every time i start to doze out my body wake me up it's so weird and uh needless to say uh it got so bad i couldn't sleep i mean i mean open days tomorrow you know we just got set up and scouted and everything it's coming a monsoon she's panicking like she would wish she had bought this thing that had the uh thing where basically we can get lifelike because i went down in this this spot here and where i went down i had this big old rack i made i mean you know go bigger home i made this gigantic rack that when you went down in there he was dragging i'm like there ain't no way and it's heavy i'm like ain't no way and it's coming to mind saying thank god i had to tarp me and just go get my brother it tarped up the thing and it was monsooning on us and they we're like i'm like there ain't no way i'm only her driving me out here tonight i'm like i just been i'm just praying and believing and that i mean dude it was a long night anyway i mean i was like couldn't even breathe i could i can't explain it to you like i thought i was gonna die but all i could do is she checked my heart rate at that time i never really paid a whole lot of attention it was like down to like 38 and i think what was my breasts like 80 79 something like that or lower she says lower it got way down and i remember talking about martha and them uh uh their thing when they have them on the cover and they're like oh yeah you don't come back from it when it gets this low without getting on the machine and i was lowering that i'm thinking oh god you know i'm panicking you know and uh i just i was i was laying there in the dark and i was crying you know crying out to god because i felt like i was gonna die and uh i didn't want to sit there and dive up for ten thousand feet and my wife had to find me and uh anyway made it through the night and uh i don't know if this has anything to do with anything but i had to eat these berries and we just tied the two things together later on this may or may not had nothing to do with it i don't know i'd eat these berries like soft side roast man there's some good looking blueberries i got either the bitterest blueberries you ever eat and uh i had taken uh at the time i was taking a couple uh melatonin pills you get from walmart and uh it's like what was the next day or something i was walking up the mountain i'm walking up the mountain and here here comes uh some little berries here i'm like i'll take them up you know because after all this you look back you ain't supposed to just eat wild berries up here in colorado and uh i eat this berry and the uh that night it happens again and always skip tonight that's what it was it skipped tonight and because i was good the next time because the first night i think well maybe i was just acclimating too well the next night was good then third night it happens to me again as i'm laying there and it's happening to me again i feel like i'm about to die and i'm losing all my breath and like my heart feels like dude it's like coming down like zero beating hardly feels like uh i start tying all these together i'm like i did that and did that that's the only thing is the same i'm like and i'm googling and all this and you see something wild berries can cause like respiratory problems and things like that i'm like oh my gosh but anyway i was going to come back and share that testimony that was another testimony of god keeping me and then i got all nervous and scared and put it off and procrastinated end up not ever doing that but you know in romans 8 28 here he said all things work together for the good of them they're called that are called to them according who are they called according to his purpose you know and uh uh i had this here oh yeah anybody can get up and leave any time too you ain't gonna hurt my feelings i understand it's just a lit learning experience i'm giving a testimony either your life story or maybe just share some testimonies and when the says looking at the unseen when the great crisis come which always does when the uh of giza was being just a lukewarm church render member when he had not seen what elijah had seen because he was walking walking by faith he was looking at the unseen all the time you know uh sorry about that wrong oh i think of david in the writings of psalms when muslim industry takes takes distress to bring the best out of a man it's really that's when god gets down to when we fast many times to get ourselves in position to get ourselves out of the way and i think when david and these in this place then he began to meditate on the lord he began to think about things many times god gets us in in a tight corner where we have to look up sometimes even he has to get us on our back or in the hospital or our bed somewhere we can't so we can look up to see the great blessings of god you know it means a lot to me when you just come from laying up in the hospital for a while you know uh these this right here this is just the other day when i was asking the lord about something and he shows me this right on time it's like god knows how to use things got a couple devotionals i read and stuff and he you know he'll get you know uh one night me and lyric had been lifting weights and everything and having a good day together and that night i had this pain a little bit a little bit of a sharp pain in my chest and it was like that was weird you know and then all of a sudden it came back really hard i mean just felt like you had my heart like it and then it got super hot then it felt like you just took a dagger to my spine and was just doing that right there i mean excruciating pain like i can't describe you know we went on and uh uh what went on i was like trying not to sit there i told y'all a little bit about that but uh uh you know i was trying to cowboy up i'll tell tammy i just got a cowboy up and i said we think cowboys did back in she laughed she said they died i won't forget that it stuck with me that was funny i got to take out that even in the ambulance you know i'm like yeah it's true about an hour later i finally sucked it up and went on went to the doctor and the doctor he's like man i can't believe it just by your signs the symptoms of what you're telling me you you got a aortic tear and i'm you know i don't know what it is he starts telling me all this and everything they've run this test and he's like yep and he's like telling me stuff and blah blah blah and you know what i got to get an ambulance i'm like can we just drive and they're like no you gotta ride the ambulance you know all i'm thinking money money money the bills are going up is it like you right now this doctor another doctor you're like oh my gosh you're just living life you know you know what i'm saying you're living life now you're going through this uh and uh you know i start you start i get there in bowling green i'm sitting there and i start looking on google and everything you start looking up the things what he doesn't tell me i got you know now you're now you're starting to paint now you're starting to see you know i just got a few things here you can look up i ordered a section that says kill some someone instantly or within a couple days as many as as 40 percent die almost instantly and the risk of death untreated increases three to four percent every hour of the conditions left untreated you know so that right there already a miracle this is yeah uh and you're laying there i'm laying there and i tell me i'm in there all night i don't i don't ever even sleep i'm waiting on the doctor i don't know what time if he's gonna be here four or five whatever i can't say i can't quit thinking about you know what in the world you know i'm saying and they got me on morphine it's not even helping it you know it's it's just excruciating pain uh come to find out it was just because my blood pressure's so high it was pushing on the nerves in your spine that's why i feel like that where it swelled that aorta and uh you know me and me and tammy didn't really realize how bad it was yet but you know uh then i have a doctor coming there and he's talking to me he was like man as soon as i got the call i was scared to death when they told me i'm doc don't tell me you're scared to death what i'm saying you know what i'm saying what are you talking about man and uh you know had to start to scare you when a doctor scares you and the next morning they tell me now that uh they don't have the blood bank to do what they need to do to me there you know that they're gonna have to life flight me you know now you start you're just really getting overwhelmed with what's happening you know what i'm saying uh you can now imagine you're not you know you're living life 30 hours later you know this is a life-altering thing that has happened to you is what he's telling me your mind just can't you can't even wrap it around your mind where you go so anyway how's life flooded that's pretty cool ride you know and i get there and it was like a red carpet treatment you've never seen so many doctors and suits and uh scrubs whatever they're taking me down the life flight ramp to go in and we get in there i get in a hospital room dude it was lined with doctors they they're like hey mr richmond your high priority here today and you know uh wow okay and he starts telling me he's like you know blah blah blah he's starting to tell me about what we're gonna do with surgery and uh uh i'm kind of like you know just overwhelmed you know and i just know that they said uh they done told me you know brothers just around the world praying for me you know that we're gonna believe for uh no surgery so they want to go back and run another cat scan on me and when they run the cat scan and it comes back because he doesn't explain why in the middle of all that he's explaining to me what we're going to do we're going to crack open my chest plate do all this i'm going to use this teddy bear and everything else you're just like wow so you know uh in the meantime uh we're waiting on to come back it comes back that was a type b it was a lower so praise god there's a second miracle i wound up not having to have surgery and uh and uh uh the doctor then he comes in the main main man he comes in there we're talking and i'm like you know i was like how long was it gonna take to heal you know and he's like a terrorist terror it won't ever heal i'm like what do you mean you know you're wrapping your mind around that you can't wrap your mind around these things you know you think everything always heals up you're like what and uh so anyway i'm in icu and everything and they're telling me you can't lift no weights you can't five pounds you know five pounds you can't you can't do nothing you're asking them like can i hunt can i do this there's nope nope nope you can't you can't do this can't do that you can't you can't do this or that and you know you can't imagine the devastating beliefs that you're in right now because you know uh no one can stay all night no one can stay all night no no only one visitor at the time because all the cove and stuff and everything and you know and then it happened that this day now i'm up it's thanksgiving i'm in the hospital i'm missing everybody out and everybody's at thanksgiving my mom and uh tammy tammy she can go enjoy it with her family and everything you feel like it's all my fault you know and the next day after that me and lyric was going to be sitting in my thing for his birthday and you know i'm dealing with all that and it's just overwhelming and uh i tell tammy i tell her after uh my mom and chuck and my aunt and uncle come see me tell them that uh i don't want them more visitors i said uh you know it's just because at that time i done became really miserable inside because this man just here and told me everything i worked for it's gone on everything i was gonna do with my son gone everything i was gonna do with my wife all the things we were gonna do in our future god when you're faced with that i can't do nothing i'm laying there around by myself because nobody could be there at night you're all in your head you know you can't even get out of bed you get a pee in a urinal thing or whatever and uh i am i'm gonna do faster but it was just just overwhelming uh what is happening you know and then you know you say something to your wife and she don't really you know show a lot of motion too sometime you know she'd cry you know i couldn't see nothing but doom and gloom you know all i could i couldn't see no beauty of the forest for the trees in my way you know and i i thought literally couldn't be any worse to me at that time they just told me i mean because i can't heal can't do nothing i can't what am i nothing you know i mean i was thinking everything like i mean cancer this and that i'm like this is worse than everything literally that was where my mind was and uh it was just devastating to me you know uh it was just gone you know he said you can't do nothing none of that because you'll die it's that serious if you do anything it ruptures on you you're gonna die out immediately you know and you're just like why don't we just do the surgery why don't we just do surgery anyway he said no there's so many complications with the surgery that uh it's too high of a risk unless you absolutely need it and so then you know thinking all this and that and uh you would think you know normal thoughts you know if you get pain or something you just you know you might have to tough it out through somebody you know what i'm saying you just cowboy up with this they're like no don't tough it out take it easy you're like oh my word but uh and so keep in mind i had days that i was just depressing in a dark place you know i got to such a dark place that uh i couldn't just start thinking about anything but just uh ending it all and just be done with it and uh i hadn't called nobody at that time really and uh i called talking to him and we was talking you know i mean i just was just depressed anyway i didn't even want to talk about but just something i just led to call him and you know we're talking and we just began to keep talking and joe old encourager started encouraging me and everything next thing you know he's encouraging me that you know that's a miracle and everything he started believing yeah yep amen i am a miracle and it's like why am i gonna stop here he saved me then on the way there he saved me uh here from having to have the surgery save me there if he done all that why can't he heal me right up it says by his word by stripes i'm healed then you start receiving that you start getting them seeds you start watering them they start taking root you know you start feeding on them and then you start you start it's a fight or flight now we're starting to fight back starting to you know shaking devils off you know i'm starting to see some hope at the end of the tunnel you know and you know i'd been i started began to ponder on the lord and telling him how sorry i was that i didn't get up here lord and praised your name and gave you more glory for all that you've done and try to live in fear and be scared to do it and now i'm sorry i'm dragging it all out for y'all but uh here we are and you know he said me do a lot of things you know it it it's just wow all the things he brought me through brought me over but all through this life he's been building my faith lifting my faith and getting me through the things that uh uh you know that all you know all i know is his word to be the truth you know you read the scriptures when you're by stripes i'm healed you think all this and you start thinking on things like godliness with contentment's great gain i should have been more content with where what i had in him you know instead of always wanting more all this and that or not giving him the time be more in christ jesus you know and greater is he that lives within me that he that is in this world you know jesus came and paid the price for my healing on calvary you know uh hezekiah's prayers he said change the mind of god i began to pray because i told both time i was like man or i think i did i was i felt like i was in the state of limbo like you know you believe you're healed but then you're like all at the same time you're like you know sometimes god test people to see how they react you know if that picture don't come back when i go to my uh checkup you wanted to come back like oh there was never a tear there you know there's never a tear there you want that you know and it's like well if it don't come back that so i just started praying god it'd be make it your perfect will that i be healed if it wasn't your perfect will start start changing that start believing in a different way instead of being like well what if it wasn't so then i started doing that start believing that and start you know believing his word here and his word says by his stripes i am healed and it was that simple it's that's very simple you know and i said romans 10 17 says then faith cometh by hearing by the word psalms 38 15 for in thee oh lord do i put my hope and will here oh lord my god he'll hear us and he'll spare tonight he says psalm 239 spare me that i may recover strength praise god psalm 37 the lord knoweth our days and malachi 4 2 he comes with healing and his wings jesus said ask anything in my name that will i do i've got scriptures for days for all this but you know you just keep pondering on them day in and day out you know uh you know i changed my focus changed my focus started really focusing getting off my phone worthlessness any tv shows anything started feeding and reading and believing you know it's a white dog black dog fight you know i love that story the white dog the black dog is a simple story you know the little indian that gave his heart to the lord and you know he came back and asked him you know how's it been he said well ever since then there's been a white dog and a black dog and they fight all the time he said which one wins whichever one i feed the most you know so you know i walk in there in scots we'll meet the doctor there she tells me you know your first thing she said when you walk in you're walking talking miracle i said yeah i believe that she said you know when i was in school there was only like a a percentage of uh like it was super low percentage whatever it was that ever make it she said and it made harry on my arm stand up and hurt through he said uh you're the third person i've seen making y'all don't know how many people i've witnessed to and told them my story and they said my grandma died from that so and so died from that so-and-so definitely you're like wow you know i didn't show you more or miracle i am so i was coming all the way up for checkup and chair testimony good to show pictures oh yeah i thought it'd be good just you know that's what i wanted to go with i was like oh that was the how nice it would have been to come in here and showed you the picture of it being healed up they already you know but now i come in here and tell you that it is healed even though whatever that doctor can't see we already know so if it ain't healed then it's my fault if it's my fault then i didn't have the faith so god grant me the faith and help my unbelief and every little bit of faith i get stitches it back up until i made whole because you know i only hold back what he's already done you know the bible says he's the high priest of our confession i believe i believe uh 100 percent his word to be the truth and if it is by stripes i'm healed then i got the revelation of it laying there i'll share that testimony with you i landed on a cat scan i'm laying there on my checkup day i'm laying there you know we've heard the grayson number five it rolls me back at this one spot when we stop it said 666.5 i said i just started laughing i said well that's the devil on one hand god on the right i said ultimately lord you paid the price calvary some peace comes over me i believe i was healed i didn't care what doctor had to say we went on went on believing and you know praise god it don't matter what the doctor says a great physician that said what it is it's healed so you know uh i believe all things are impossible for him this deer hunter he's a doctor man he comes in we're talking we're going back and forth he's telling me stories he's coming in there all the time he actually started coming on his breaks kicking it with me hanging out and talking and fellowshipping with me and uh he said something he'd been seeing my oxygen levels how they were he was like have you ever been checking for sleep apnea i'm like nah he's like you put you use the restroom a lot at night and i'm like dude we ain't even gonna go there you know what i'm saying we ain't gonna talk about that frustrating and he's like there that i had the same problem blah blah blah he said i got that machine i don't have to do it no more you know and i tell you that to tell you this that uh after i came back home uh i was having the same problem using the restroom i mean y'all wouldn't believe six seven eight ten times a night just so aggravating uh and uh i said it came to me that same lord that you're believing to heal your aorta you don't believe he can heal you of this i said i do and i've been normal for two weeks now [Applause] so all things work together for the good he said uh uh i'll be with you even in you to end the world uh john 5 000 says search the scriptures search the scriptures for in them you think there they wish they testified me i said uh you know this terror has been a blessing you know it's drawn me closer to god got me focused back on him so he's rekindled the fire the little look of fire i have and i said years ago i wanted to go and be a helping encouragement burn victims and go to jails and rehabs outreach be a witness of the gospel and i say to you today uh i thought even deeper on it after that message that one day and i had been thinking on it i ask you today what is the gospel to you you know you can think on that a second what is the gospel to you you know christ paid for our sins our healing our deliverance on calvary in john 3 16 there he said god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whoever shall believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life the scriptures also say you must be born again ezekiel 3 36 26 a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put in you within you and i will take away the old stony heart and put a heart of flesh and will give you a new heart flesh acts 2 38 says repent be baptized every one of you names jesus christ for permission your sins you shall receive a holy ghost that is the simple good news it's not an intellectual all worked up hand-me-down religion it's not a painted fire on the wall it's a real holy ghost fire experience that'll change your life then by faith you can go on believing every word to be the truth you can live me a sermon don't just preach me one now we're at the conclusion i'm so sorry folks learn uh how maybe to do a shorter version next time so no ma so no matter your story how big or how small the testimonies they all have just as good and important as of an impact as the next every little bit helps there's no substitute for experience so share yours as we work together in the lord let's get together on the front lines of the battlefield today and from here on out doing the next thing next right thing going to church reading our bible praying testifying bringing god his glory and praise to his name to me that gives the devil's knuckle sandwiches and i said it gives the devil a knuckle sandwich and a two-edged sword to their neck that's what we have to do for all the pain and hurting he's caused me and my family and our loved ones all the ones gone before us all the time we've lost that we could have gave the lord i said run devil run we on a head hunt mission now god be for us who can be against us who's ready to fight a good fight of faith [Applause] doctor told him he couldn't do nothing right one thing i wanted to ask tommy is funny what do you say last time you could do now and you can lift and you can do stuff right what he said last time so praise the lord that's a lot better [Applause] amen little by little amen and what now oh yeah yeah i wish that i had that little flick up there but anyway he sent me a picture video of him being out all camouflage well i'm out here you know and he says and he was referring to brother brad's message on the good news so he gave a little testimony i'd like that but praise the lord like message him and the good news so praise the lord god bless you amen uh we won't prolong it too much longer but if anybody has a little burning testimony that you want to give we'll give you opportunities go ahead a job uh supernatural all
