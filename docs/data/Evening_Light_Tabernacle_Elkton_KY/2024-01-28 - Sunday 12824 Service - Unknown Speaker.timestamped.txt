[2:53] Egypt amen that's uh
[2:57] brother brother
[3:12] how y'all doing
[3:15] today I'm pretty good A little
[3:19] nervous what y'all come to
[3:22] do what y'all come to do come on you
[3:27] know this is like a this is like the
[3:28] pepper alley a PE a a a pre-meal
[3:31] appetizer you know I was thinking about
[3:33] it you know I I was just thinking about
[3:34] how we can get all fired up together and
[3:36] create that atmosphere where the Lord
[3:38] just feels welcome when Brother Brad
[3:39] comes but you know I hope you brought
[3:41] your little lick of fire that we can
[3:42] just pull on the gift of God you know
[3:44] you know my little thought this morning
[3:46] on my Bible study was uh God gave us his
[3:50] very best and what the prophet teach us
[3:52] he taught us God gave us his very best
[3:55] gave us his word so I got to think about
[3:58] he giving himself he he himself he is
[4:00] the word so when we stop and think about
[4:02] that can you just think about the king
[4:04] of king the king of glory coming down
[4:06] here to us to be one of us the one who
[4:08] created all of us and then to be able to
[4:11] call us and be calling us out into the
[4:13] bride the message of the hour the hour
[4:16] of special hand selected people that
[4:18] will fulfill Malachi the restoration of
[4:21] the church and the power of Christ the
[4:23] word we see Christ in us the hope of
[4:26] glory the manifestation of Jesus Christ
[4:28] in our lives is the more it becomes more
[4:31] real to me is is just mindblowing to me
[4:34] to see that that we start seeing God
[4:36] coming off the off the cross out of the
[4:38] manger out of the paper in a living
[4:39] reality in us you know and it's just so
[4:42] powerful when we start seeing that you
[4:44] know and and it's such a a privilege and
[4:46] honor to be the bride of Christ we are
[4:47] the alpha and omega joint HS bone of
[4:50] bone in fellowship with Christ so I got
[4:52] to thinking last night and I looked up
[4:54] that word in the Greek Lexicon and said
[4:56] I can't pronounce this word con or
[4:59] whatever is translated form in the Greek
[5:00] word which translates concept the
[5:03] concepts such as Fellowship joint
[5:05] participation partnership there to share
[5:08] one has anything a gift jointly
[5:10] contributed Fellowship
[5:13] Association uh Community communion joint
[5:17] joint
[5:19] participation with Christ he said the
[5:21] works I do you shall do also I'm the
[5:24] vine you are the branches you can do
[5:25] nothing except you abide in me you see
[5:28] there you see that's Christ in US the
[5:30] we're written Epistles read of all men
[5:32] we're going to be the billboard for
[5:33] Christ because it's Christ Living
[5:34] Through us it's a living uh
[5:36] manifestation of God's word that's him
[5:39] himself that's what that's what I want
[5:41] to paint that picture of seeing God
[5:43] himself Elohim the all existing one that
[5:46] came down from the glory to be in us to
[5:48] be in Fellowship to be partnership with
[5:50] him because that's what he longed for
[5:52] before the foundation of the world it
[5:54] just got me so fired up thinking about
[5:55] it knowing this knowing Christ the word
[5:57] as Miss Jesus Christ of fellowship with
[5:59] him them is much deeper the world than
[6:01] the world has thanks the Mysteries that
[6:03] we're hidden from the from the
[6:05] foundation of the world we have now
[6:07] through a prophet that he sent us and
[6:09] he's opened our eyes of understanding
[6:10] and helped us see it such a buzzing
[6:13] hallelujah praise God gets me fired up
[6:15] thanking about I I don't know Bo ver
[6:17] contain myself up here I was just
[6:19] thinking about it on the way here I was
[6:20] just so fired up it just gets me but
[6:22] think about this the king of kings that
[6:24] mighty king when you just stop and think
[6:26] about it he said let there be light
[6:29] every little molecule and every
[6:30] ingredient whatever it was that came and
[6:32] made the sight the sun whatever it was
[6:34] all them ingredients obeyed the word of
[6:36] God you know when he said he spoke and
[6:39] something happened something happened I
[6:40] loved how Brad brought that out about
[6:42] Adam and when he breathed life into him
[6:44] he said he went in the action something
[6:46] happens when the Holy Ghost comes on you
[6:47] put you in action you can't help it but
[6:49] go blessed be the name of the Lord
[6:51] Joshua 1 and I said Lord help us fulfill
[6:54] your Commandments in our life we all
[6:55] have a we all have our own book of Acts
[6:57] that we got to write we have our own
[6:59] individual relationship that we must
[7:01] live out through Christ in us you know
[7:03] Joshua 1:9 says have not I commanded
[7:06] thee be strong and of good courage Be
[7:09] not Afraid neither be dismayed for the
[7:11] Lord thy God is with thee whether soever
[7:14] thou goest he said I'll be with you even
[7:16] in you to the end of the world that are
[7:18] to put a trust and a faith in us in
[7:19] Jesus Christ he's with us he's even in
[7:22] us to the end of the world but you throw
[7:25] up the first slide here instead of ever
[7:27] having everybody turn to the scripture I
[7:29] just had dmy throw them on some slides
[7:30] for us you know John 10 here says I am
[7:33] the Good Shepherd I know my sheep and
[7:35] and am known of mine and the father
[7:36] knoweth me even so know I the father I
[7:39] laid down my life for the sheep and
[7:42] other sheep have I which are not of this
[7:44] fold them also must I bring they shall
[7:47] hear my voice and they shall be of one
[7:49] fold and one Shepherd therefore doeth my
[7:52] father love me because I Lay My Life
[7:55] down and that I may take it up again no
[7:58] man taketh it from me me but I'll lay it
[8:00] down myself I have power to lay it down
[8:02] and I have power to take it up again so
[8:04] this is a Commandment that I have
[8:06] received of my father see Jesus Christ
[8:08] right there being obedient to the
[8:10] Commandment that God gave him so blessed
[8:12] be the name of the Lord thank you Lord
[8:14] Jesus that you came down and to to live
[8:17] to die to go that you may come back and
[8:20] live through US blessed be the name of
[8:22] the Lord go ahead and go the next slide
[8:23] he says right here God brother bam said
[8:25] and why he said God gave us the very
[8:27] best at the beginning for his great
[8:29] Mighty Army he has never had to change
[8:31] it because as I said last night his
[8:33] first decision is the best and only he
[8:36] gave his people his word think about it
[8:38] his word himself let's just paint that
[8:40] that's him that's him being with us he
[8:42] said everybody next slide everybody
[8:45] knows that you have to train to hit your
[8:47] enemy and always God uses his word we
[8:51] must remember that God uses his word to
[8:53] De feed his enemy if God could think or
[8:55] could give have give his people anything
[8:57] better to feed his enemy with he would
[9:00] have done it so as I have said when God
[9:02] makes a decision that's the best that
[9:04] there is he never has to alter his
[9:07] decisions so the first decision God gave
[9:09] his people in the Garden of Eden to
[9:11] combat the enemy was his word they were
[9:14] fortified behind that word you know that
[9:16] was Jesus Christ that hedge of
[9:18] protection he gives us his word that we
[9:20] can live by man shall not live by bread
[9:22] alone but every word proceed out mou of
[9:24] God blessed be the name of the Lord I
[9:26] just got to thinking on something the
[9:27] other day I got to thinking that you
[9:29] know we've heard it but I got to
[9:30] thinking about something that was lost I
[9:32] was sitting there I was just
[9:33] fellowshipping with the Lord and I got
[9:34] to thinking I just it just came out of
[9:36] me and I was just thanking you Lord
[9:38] thanking that you saw me down through
[9:39] the sands of time that I got lost but
[9:41] I'm only going back to where I come from
[9:43] in his mind before the foundation of the
[9:45] world then I got to thinking about about
[9:47] brother bam said we're just in the pawn
[9:49] shop of the devil when you start
[9:50] thinking about that I started thinking
[9:52] are you lost in the pawn shop or are you
[9:55] lost for the redeemed are you lost in
[9:58] need salvation under repentance or are
[10:00] you lost uh redeemed are you one of
[10:02] those that were on his mind before the
[10:04] foundation of the world glory to God you
[10:06] know without him God himself coming down
[10:08] from G living us a life living us an
[10:11] example you know what a great sacrifice
[10:13] you know I just heard a minister say a
[10:15] sacrifice is not a sacrifice unless it's
[10:17] a sacrifice huh come on so when you
[10:20] think about it what are we making little
[10:21] sacrifices for the Lord God today
[10:23] getting out of his way that he may live
[10:25] and have preeminence in our life that he
[10:27] may be able to walk through us and go
[10:29] get himself more glory and honor and
[10:30] praise to his name cuz he's worthy to be
[10:33] praised blessed be the name of the Lord
[10:35] it just gets me so fired up I'm sorry
[10:37] but I can't help it it just BS out I
[10:39] about want to run around circles right
[10:40] now man Hallelujah so it just gets me so
[10:44] fired up so he came to live I get hit my
[10:46] nose he lived to die to live through us
[10:48] and fellowship with our Mighty Redeemer
[10:50] you know Philippians 3:9 through1 says
[10:53] through the Faith of Christ the the
[10:56] righteousness which is of god by faith
[10:58] that I may know him in the power of His
[11:00] Resurrection come on I'm a witness you
[11:03] know I've seen him I've seen him in
[11:05] times you know God manifesting his word
[11:07] in my life I had a bush hog fall my foot
[11:09] and then after it happened you know I
[11:10] got up and Shu it off and sit in the
[11:12] belly thing God was giving me scripture
[11:14] and I was bushhoging right after that
[11:16] and he dropped down and dropped in my
[11:17] thought he said I'm a very present help
[11:19] in a time of need when I was coming off
[11:20] my medication different things he said
[11:22] man shall not live by bed alone but
[11:24] every word proceed out of mouth of God
[11:26] God gave me them scriptures as I had
[11:28] need of them and we stay in tune with
[11:30] him he'll give you what you need as you
[11:32] need it Philippians 4:19 I got it wrote
[11:35] down but my God shall supply all your
[11:37] needs huh so I had this little thought
[11:39] yesterday and said I was driving down
[11:41] the road on the way to work I said
[11:43] without without the fire what good is
[11:45] the oil huh what good is the oil takes
[11:47] the fire to put the oil into action well
[11:50] I sent that to some buddies send it to
[11:51] the group sent it to my brother and and
[11:53] I get to thinking he said are you not
[11:56] are you a light of the world or is your
[11:58] a flame are you a flame a fire in Action
[12:00] a billboard for Christ and I sent that
[12:03] to a brother and he sent me back this
[12:04] which you know I just so thought it was
[12:05] so awesome because the same God that
[12:07] worked through brother brandom the same
[12:09] God worked through all the prophets
[12:10] Works in you and me so God started
[12:13] dropping down my heart and then look
[12:14] what he said he sent me back what the
[12:16] prophet said after I sent him that
[12:17] little thought I had so brother bandam
[12:19] said here in the rising of the sun it
[12:21] just won't move no matter how good the
[12:23] mechanics is until the Dynamics come
[12:25] when the Dynamics come the fire is made
[12:28] to connect that octane with the gasoline
[12:31] and when that that explodes it causes a
[12:33] combustion and that combustion moves
[12:35] every part every move for he's the same
[12:37] yesterday today and forever that's the
[12:39] resurrection that's the real power of
[12:41] God mechanics with the Dynamics notice
[12:43] it's the spirit that qu quickens it's
[12:46] the spark that fires it's not gas that
[12:48] fires it's the spark that fires the gas
[12:50] come on Hallelujah you can do nothing
[12:52] without me but with me you can do all
[12:54] things as he is the word it's the father
[12:56] living father the father has sent me so
[12:59] I send you as the father has fired me
[13:01] and pushed me into everything I do only
[13:04] that which is pleasing to God now as he
[13:06] has sent me so I'll send you with the
[13:09] same mechanics and it takes the same
[13:11] Dynamics to operate it and these shines
[13:14] shall follow them that believe follow
[13:16] them that claim the mechanics and have
[13:18] the Dynamics will take its place huh
[13:20] come on I just love that I was like see
[13:22] that's the same Lord that gave him that
[13:25] same thing just gave me that little
[13:26] thought it's just the same just in a
[13:28] different way you know and and first
[13:31] Thessalonians 1:5 says for Our Gospel
[13:34] came not in word only but in power of
[13:36] the Holy Ghost and in much assurance
[13:39] that kind of caught me I'm like I want
[13:41] to look it up so I Googled that and it
[13:42] said Assurance Assurance a positive
[13:45] declaration intended to give confidence
[13:48] of a promise uh confidence or a
[13:51] certainty in one's own abilities so what
[13:55] are we having confidence and Assurance
[13:56] Blessed Assurance he huh what do we have
[13:58] that in Jesus Christ Our Hope uh we
[14:01] standing on that solid rock that Firm
[14:03] Foundation where are we going and then
[14:04] it goes on to another definition of it
[14:07] the act of assurance we making a
[14:08] declaration in terms that furnish ground
[14:11] of confidence confidence in the boldness
[14:14] coming boldly before the throne of grace
[14:15] that you may be able to receive what you
[14:17] ask for receive what you ask for
[14:19] believing for all things are possible he
[14:21] said a firm persuasion a full confidence
[14:24] of trust freedom from doubt a certain
[14:26] expectation let us draw near when a True
[14:29] Heart in full Assurance of Faith the
[14:31] firmness of Mind undoubting steadiness
[14:34] excessive boldness huh and it said any
[14:37] WR writing or legal evidence of the
[14:41] concy of property huh are we a bought
[14:45] property we are we we have a Blessed
[14:47] assurance that we're his well that word
[14:49] kind of caught my eyes so then I looked
[14:51] that up and it says the con concy in the
[14:54] terms is the act in one which the
[14:57] ownership or a proper property is
[14:59] transferred from one to the other I said
[15:01] Jesus didn't Jesus say he that believeth
[15:04] on me the works that I do shall he do
[15:06] also huh see he's transferred the power
[15:09] now from the apostles now all the way
[15:11] down to us now we're bride of Jesus
[15:13] Christ we have the same power that he
[15:15] has obviously we're not going to be
[15:17] raising the dead Healing The Sick doing
[15:19] this but as we had need of like I said

[19:03] touch the stove you know and he said
[19:05] then you yell at it and then it runs you
[19:06] know and it made me think about Adam in
[19:08] the garden he's in trouble he run man
[19:10] always running from the presence of God
[19:12] when he's in trouble huh so but what he
[19:14] said here he was really breaking it down
[19:15] he said but then when that little baby
[19:17] go touches the stove it comes crying to
[19:19] Daddy come crying to Mama and it brings
[19:21] him up there and then he knows now why
[19:23] he told me not to touch the stove he
[19:25] loved me and he said that's the same way
[19:27] that our God is is he saw all of our
[19:29] thoughts before the foundation of the
[19:31] world he loved us so much he knew he was
[19:33] going to touch the stove but he was
[19:35] wants us to come and say father I'm
[19:37] sorry I messed up I need you I touched
[19:40] the stove I messed up Lord help me I
[19:42] just love that I thought that was so
[19:43] powerful you know and it just it it just
[19:45] like wow so simple but powerful and I
[19:48] had this little clip here we was just
[19:49] listening on the way here I told him I
[19:51] was going to share it interpretation
[19:53] brother Timothy had been in Uganda and
[19:55] preached a meeting and he came home and
[19:57] he was sick sick and he couldn't preach
[19:59] on he couldn't preach on Wednesday night
[20:01] couldn't preach on on Sunday because he
[20:03] was so sick and he was just completely
[20:06] wore out he was I think on the couch if
[20:09] I've got this right and God does
[20:12] everything perfectly here he is on the
[20:14] couch watching my streaming and as she's
[20:17] speaking in tongues he gets the
[20:21] interpretation thank you
[20:27] Lord
[20:30] he said this went through him as tongues
[20:33] went forth and it won't leave me I felt
[20:37] weird to tested to somebody that was at
[20:39] the service but for two days it keeps
[20:41] going through
[20:43] me this is my word you create the
[20:47] atmosphere and I will feel it come
[20:51] on and as you praise me walls will
[20:55] fall as you praise me I will will fight
[20:58] for
[20:59] you praise me praise me come on
[21:05] Amen that just fired me up this morning
[21:08] thinking about it you know I was just
[21:09] sitting there we just had a fellowship
[21:11] with brother Matt you know I know he
[21:12] wouldn't mind me saying this but he told
[21:14] some stories that last year at Louisiana
[21:16] there he said they was down there and
[21:17] you know how everybody's worshiping and
[21:19] stuff and they might the ministers might
[21:20] go in the back he said they went in the
[21:22] back he said next thing you know brother
[21:24] Donnie broke out speaking in tongues he
[21:25] said the most fluent Spanish he had ever
[21:27] heard in his life he said then he come
[21:29] with an interpretation he told it and he
[21:31] said then he started speaking in like
[21:32] Egyptian he said he told he he said it
[21:34] was so fluent he said it was he said it
[21:36] was upper room stuff he said and when it
[21:38] when the interpretation came forth said
[21:41] uh preach my gospel I'll be with you
[21:43] you've waited decades or something and
[21:45] paraphrasing it waited all these years
[21:47] and now go you know basically I'll be
[21:49] with you and we're seeing the
[21:51] manifestation of the power of bride of
[21:53] Christ but reason why I said that is
[21:55] because he said brother Andrew told him
[21:56] to write it down because this is for the
[21:58] bride this is for all of us that's why I
[22:01] I shared that clip because that clip
[22:03] when they speak in tongues it ain't just
[22:04] for them out there we're all a part of
[22:06] the body of Jesus Christ we're trying to
[22:08] rise up we're going to rise up we're
[22:10] going to have the victory over all this
[22:12] we're going to be getting ready to get
[22:13] out of here bless be the name of the
[22:14] Lord you know so it just got me thinking
[22:16] I had that you know I heard that clip it
[22:18] was right before I had on here see
[22:20] that's the atmosphere we can create
[22:21] right now no matter what we can get rid
[22:24] of all fears and we can come boldly
[22:26] before the throne of grace believe in
[22:28] that all things are possible casting
[22:30] down imaginations bringing every thing
[22:32] every imagination Into The Obedience of
[22:35] Christ the word what do you have need of
[22:38] use Jesus Christ the word if you need
[22:41] healing speak the word if you need
[22:44] Deliverance or chain breaking way making
[22:46] speak the word if you have need of
[22:48] Salvation or the baptism of the Holy
[22:50] Ghost speak the word what they asked
[22:52] Peter what must I do to be saved he said
[22:54] repent be baptized every one of you in
[22:56] the name of Jesus Christ you shall
[22:58] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[23:00] blessed be the name of the Lord then you
[23:01] can apply the Tok and the blood of the
[23:03] doorpost and walk in the spirit as he is
[23:05] in the spirit we're Miss Jesus Christ
[23:07] it's our power and authority to go
[23:10] possess the land he's gave it to us
[23:11] speak and go forward believe for all
[23:13] things are possible you know the devil
[23:15] came preaching a lie to Eve he comes
[23:19] preaching to all of us lies all the time
[23:21] I I can tell you as simple as he comes
[23:23] there'll be times I'll feel that little
[23:25] bug you know when you're about to get
[23:26] sick there's been numerous times now I
[23:29] can't tell you how many times I felt the
[23:30] bug start coming and I didn't say a
[23:32] thing I was like I'm not going to even
[23:33] speak nothing and I just kept on
[23:35] believing next day felt great I can tell
[23:37] you there was two different times I said
[23:38] I'm kind of feel a little sick next day
[23:40] sicker than a dog why because he came
[23:42] trying to give me a little box rattle
[23:44] snake try to come give me a little
[23:45] something in my mind contrary to God's
[23:47] word but you know he's a very present
[23:50] help in a time of need and if you need
[23:52] it and you need healing no matter what
[23:53] but just keep that's what I put down
[23:55] here you know God himself wants to uh
[23:58] manifest himself in your life with power
[24:00] and demonstration that he can walk
[24:02] through you that he can be a
[24:04] manifestation of himself in you he is
[24:07] the word that's what my whole thought
[24:09] was that's him living through us that is
[24:12] such a blessing you know I said I put on
[24:14] here just keep testifying keep believing
[24:17] no matter what no matter what what what
[24:20] you're going through keep your never let
[24:22] your testimony be negative only believe
[24:24] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[24:26] today and forever and
[24:28] will help you overcome Whatever It Is
[24:31] God bless you hope us let just create

[59:08] time this morning
[59:14] so aren't you enjoying what the Lord's
[59:16] doing for us in our services and just a
[59:19] move of the spirit and and the service
[59:22] we had last Sunday and this Wednesday
[59:24] and and we trust that he just keep
[59:26] moving today and you know there's
[59:28] something happening and I've been saying
[59:30] it and it and it's it's a it's a move
[59:32] it's a move it's a move going on and and
[59:35] uh people are becoming to see the
[59:38] realization of of who they are the hour
[59:40] we're living in and and what God has got
[59:43] what God has called us in this hour to
[59:44] to be and to do and so we just want to
[59:48] kind of continue on our thought from
[59:50] last week on restoring God's domain and
[59:54] uh we could just I think we could preach
[59:56] for for weeks on it but we'll we'll take
[59:58] another little portion of it today and
[1:00:00] and break it down I'm going to read this
[1:00:01] to you before we read our scripture he
[1:00:04] said now here he is amongst his church
[1:00:07] today made flesh in his church certainly
[1:00:11] Elohim now if you could only realize
[1:00:14] that you men that you were made to be a
[1:00:18] amateur God you're a Son of God you're
[1:00:22] an heir of God and you have a domain
[1:00:26] amen that's three pretty good things he
[1:00:28] give us right
[1:00:29] there he made him a God over Earth he
[1:00:33] gave him dominion over everything in the
[1:00:35] earth he says that's right he gave him a
[1:00:37] Dominion he's a king a
[1:00:41] God and he said and where he got his
[1:00:44] fall he said he could speak to the trees
[1:00:47] be changed and plucked up and set over
[1:00:48] here and the winds and the waves and be
[1:00:50] still and it stop he was a god an
[1:00:53] amateur God a Son of God listen like
[1:00:56] you're a son of your
[1:00:58] father he said and all the world is
[1:01:01] groaning and
[1:01:03] waiting now listen we talked about the
[1:01:06] creation and the foundation of the world
[1:01:09] and all the world from eons and eons of
[1:01:11] times he says it is the world is
[1:01:14] groaning and it's waiting for the
[1:01:16] manifestations of the sons of God
[1:01:19] waiting for the church to get back in
[1:01:21] its place again sons of of God to be
[1:01:25] made manifest waiting for that hour he
[1:01:27] said oh I hope this don't hurt but I
[1:01:30] just had to say it he said the church is
[1:01:31] so far away from its
[1:01:35] place when he's preaching and we think
[1:01:39] we think the the that the the time has
[1:01:41] arrived and he says no the church is so
[1:01:43] far away from its place and he says it
[1:01:47] needs to get back to the sons of God
[1:01:50] again rulers governors of the earth
[1:01:53] under spirit spiritual reain he said it
[1:01:56] will be someday and he said and when the
[1:01:59] chief one comes Jesus Christ the great
[1:02:01] Millennium nature is groaning for that
[1:02:04] day can you imagine right now as we sat
[1:02:06] in our pews all of nature since the
[1:02:08] creation is moaning and
[1:02:11] groaning for us to get where we're
[1:02:13] supposed to
[1:02:15] be what a
[1:02:18] responsibility but he made a way he
[1:02:21] showed a way he gave the word he gave
[1:02:24] the Spirit he gave a way for us to get
[1:02:26] there we just got to get there we got to
[1:02:27] believe it in
[1:02:29] ourselves Romans 8 let's see what Paul
[1:02:32] has to say and I'm going to read this
[1:02:34] pretty thoroughly and and then if you'll
[1:02:36] stand with me for a little while and and
[1:02:37] then I'll let you seat I'll let you have
[1:02:39] your seat for the rest of the service
[1:02:40] how's
[1:02:42] that there is therefore now no
[1:02:45] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:02:47] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:02:51] after the spirit we ask with we in that
[1:02:54] Spirit we know was the logos it was all
[1:02:57] that God ever was all that he ever is
[1:03:00] and all that he ever will be the spirit
[1:03:02] so when we talk about Spirit as we're
[1:03:04] preaching today I want you to think
[1:03:05] about that little white light he said
[1:03:07] would begin to form and it begin to come
[1:03:09] down and it inhabited on Adam and
[1:03:11] inhabited on Christ and inhabited on
[1:03:12] Pentecost it's inhabited on us today the
[1:03:16] little white light the spirit he said
[1:03:18] for the law of the spirit of Life of
[1:03:21] Christ has made us free from the law of
[1:03:23] sin and death aren't you thankful for
[1:03:26] what the law could not do in that it was
[1:03:29] weak through the flesh God sending his
[1:03:31] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:03:34] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[1:03:37] that the righteousness of the law might
[1:03:40] be fulfilled in who us who walk not
[1:03:46] after flesh but after What Spirit
[1:03:50] brothers and sisters God is is is
[1:03:52] seeking the acts of the spirit I don't
[1:03:56] know about you but I'm seeking the acts
[1:03:58] of the
[1:04:00] spirit we're we're going to get into
[1:04:02] some of those acts before this is over
[1:04:04] with and he
[1:04:06] said for to be carnally minded is to be
[1:04:09] spiritually mind or but to be
[1:04:11] spiritually minded is life and peace so
[1:04:14] when you're living in spiritually minded
[1:04:17] places you're living your best
[1:04:20] life when you got the
[1:04:22] spirit move in you and the spirit is is
[1:04:25] is dwelling in you and leading you and
[1:04:27] guiding you you are living your best
[1:04:29] life and that life is a life of Peace
[1:04:31] it's happiness it's Joy it's overcoming
[1:04:33] it's victory that's why the spirit this
[1:04:36] logos is so important to be living and
[1:04:38] dwelling in our
[1:04:41] lives because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:04:44] against God for it's not subject to the
[1:04:46] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[1:04:50] they that are in the
[1:04:53] flesh canot pleas God you cannot please
[1:04:57] God that's hard isn't it right when you
[1:05:01] get in this
[1:05:03] flesh God is not
[1:05:05] pleased he when you get in this flesh
[1:05:07] you lose power you lose Authority you
[1:05:09] lose Dominion you lose all the good
[1:05:12] things that God has given you why
[1:05:13] because you're no longer dwelling with a
[1:05:15] spirit inside of you now you're walking
[1:05:17] and doing the things you want to do
[1:05:21] right but you not in the flesh but in
[1:05:24] the spirit so be that the spirit of God
[1:05:27] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[1:05:30] spirit he has none of this no power No
[1:05:33] Authority like we said no no no Victory
[1:05:36] no vision no domain no Kingdom no no uh
[1:05:39] no no rulership no
[1:05:43] governorship and if Christ be in you the
[1:05:46] body is dead because of sin but the
[1:05:49] spirit is life remember when we talked
[1:05:52] last week and we had Adam standing there
[1:05:53] and and the prophet said he was As Dead
[1:05:55] As could be but he said when he breathed
[1:05:57] life into him and the Spirit came in he
[1:05:59] said he jumped up and he began to move
[1:06:01] on and he moved on and he moved
[1:06:04] on because of righteousness now watch
[1:06:06] what the next verse says but if the
[1:06:08] spirit of him that raised up Christ from
[1:06:10] the dead dwell in you you mean the same
[1:06:13] spirit that was breathed into the life
[1:06:14] of Adam as he stood there as a dead tree
[1:06:18] dead as could be the same spirit that
[1:06:20] now comes into Jesus Christ and quickens
[1:06:22] him it made him jump and move what if
[1:06:26] that same Spirit dwell in
[1:06:28] you what will it do to you what if the
[1:06:32] spirit get on us what will it make you
[1:06:33] do how will it make you act what will it
[1:06:35] how will it make you live in your life
[1:06:37] I'm not talking about running and
[1:06:39] jumping and shouting and screaming and
[1:06:41] and I'm not talking about shouting and
[1:06:43] speaking in tongues I'm talking about
[1:06:44] the life you
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:48] live therefore brethren we are
[1:06:51] deaders not to the flesh to live after
[1:06:53] the flesh for if we live after the flesh
[1:06:55] you shall die but if you live through
[1:06:57] the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the
[1:07:00] body you shall live for as many are as
[1:07:02] led by the spirit of God they are who
[1:07:06] the sons of God there's power in that
[1:07:10] scripture right here Paul is speaking to
[1:07:12] us and he is identifying who we are
[1:07:15] there's sons of God for ye have not
[1:07:17] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:07:20] fear we don't have to
[1:07:22] fear
[1:07:26] you know the devil has used fear to
[1:07:28] sweep across the country to sweep across
[1:07:32] the Believers and tell you you don't
[1:07:34] have what God has given
[1:07:37] you for as many are led by the spirit of
[1:07:39] the sons of God for you have not
[1:07:40] received the spirit of bondage against
[1:07:42] the fear but you have received the
[1:07:44] spirit of
[1:07:45] adoption wherefore we cry ABA father now
[1:07:50] there's two elements I want to not I
[1:07:51] want you to notice real quick on ABA
[1:07:53] father father when you speak Abba you
[1:07:56] speak a word of
[1:07:57] intimacy so here now the word Abba it's
[1:08:00] a motivator of this prayer and it's the
[1:08:03] spirit of
[1:08:04] sunship and the spirit of sunship I want
[1:08:07] you to know is the opposite of
[1:08:09] fear so now he's crying you're crying
[1:08:12] ABA father because why we've got a close
[1:08:15] relationship now with God it's more than
[1:08:18] just a god out in the universe it's more
[1:08:21] than just a God that was back in the in
[1:08:23] the Bible days it's more than a God but
[1:08:24] it's a god of today that we can say God
[1:08:27] you're my
[1:08:28] father ABA
[1:08:31] father but the problem is is where
[1:08:34] people stop and stay right there ABA
[1:08:36] father and that's as far as they go
[1:08:37] there's two parts to the ABA father
[1:08:42] obedience oh how many times people want
[1:08:44] all the good stuff around the
[1:08:47] message oh they want all that they want
[1:08:49] the healings they want the emotions they
[1:08:51] want the shouting they want the dancing
[1:08:52] they want a Holy Ghost fi church and
[1:08:54] they want they want all that while
[1:08:56] they're there they want God to heal them

[1:08:59] their children when they're
[1:09:01] sick come on but they only are crying
[1:09:05] partially Abba Father because obedience

[1:13:39] and which are on earth even in him in
[1:13:42] whom we also have obtained an
[1:13:45] inheritance how many is thankful for an
[1:13:48] inheritance
[1:13:50] now physically speaking Naturally
[1:13:53] Speaking we love inheritance I've spoke
[1:13:55] a little bit on this and you're excited
[1:13:57] to get an inheritance but this is an
[1:13:59] inheritance above all
[1:14:03] inheritances an heir just as Christ just
[1:14:07] like Christ an heir of all things that g
[1:14:10] that that God ever
[1:14:12] was an inheritance being predestinated
[1:14:15] according to the purpose of him who
[1:14:17] worketh all things after the Council of
[1:14:19] his own that we should be praised and
[1:14:22] Glory of his glor
[1:14:23] who first trusted in Christ I'm about to
[1:14:26] finish in whom we also trusted that
[1:14:29] after you heard the word of Truth The
[1:14:31] Gospel of your salvation in whom also
[1:14:33] after ye have believed you were
[1:14:38] sealed once you believed you were
[1:14:41] sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise
[1:14:45] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:14:47] until the Redemption of the purchased
[1:14:49] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:14:54] there's a lot in those two
[1:14:56] scriptures there's a lot in those two
[1:14:58] scriptures that we could stay on and and
[1:15:00] as Paul begin to preach those things you
[1:15:02] know it confounded the people that was
[1:15:03] around him they couldn't accept they
[1:15:06] couldn't understand what he was talking
[1:15:07] about when he was talking about those
[1:15:09] things in in Romans 8 they couldn't
[1:15:11] understand what he was talking about
[1:15:13] that that that how do you cry ABA
[1:15:16] father they knew from Old Testament what
[1:15:19] what what it was tied to but they
[1:15:20] couldn't put a relationship together
[1:15:23] that God cared so much about
[1:15:26] them that he cared so much about them
[1:15:29] that they can look at him and say you
[1:15:30] are my father
[1:15:32] now Stay With Me Prophet said after
[1:15:36] you're adopted you're adopted you're
[1:15:39] placed after that ceremony said and
[1:15:41] you've been put into the body correctly
[1:15:43] you're a son you're a daughter sure when
[1:15:46] you're born again you're that that's
[1:15:47] your birth but
[1:15:50] now he said now you got to be
[1:15:53] positionally
[1:15:55] placed now you got to be positionally
[1:15:58] placed and he says the spirit itself
[1:16:01] Bears witness with our spirit that we're
[1:16:03] children of God and Jesus said whoever
[1:16:06] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:16:07] shall he do also so brothers and sisters
[1:16:10] there's no
[1:16:12] limitations we limit
[1:16:15] ourselves we limit ourselves because the
[1:16:17] world says you can't the devil says you
[1:16:20] can't be healed the devil says you can't
[1:16:22] have Financial peace the devil says you
[1:16:24] can't have a a nice home the devil says
[1:16:28] you can't have a good
[1:16:29] job the devil says you can't feel
[1:16:33] good but here we hear something
[1:16:35] completely different we hear that
[1:16:38] there's no limitations of what God can
[1:16:40] do when God is in your life and he's
[1:16:42] flowing through you and that spirit that
[1:16:44] logos is now living in you that's why
[1:16:48] it's important that we now are here to
[1:16:49] restore God's domain in our life and
[1:16:52] we're here here to see that let our
[1:16:54] lives speak for themselves brothers and
[1:16:57] sisters I thought about this and it came
[1:16:59] to me it's time to quit lingering around
[1:17:02] the message and start living
[1:17:05] it do you believe what he said if you do
[1:17:09] live
[1:17:12] it he says this child is born into a
[1:17:15] home and he becomes a son the very
[1:17:17] moment he was born into that family and
[1:17:19] he said that
[1:17:21] boy gets a Tut
[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:26] oh
[1:17:27] yeah you going to be you're going to be
[1:17:29] a child of God you going to get an
[1:17:32] [Applause]
[1:17:33] education it depends on how how you take
[1:17:36] it what kind of education you
[1:17:39] get but he said that boy gets a tutor
[1:17:42] over him and that tutor would take and
[1:17:45] and and he would take the father and go
[1:17:47] to the father and he say your son is
[1:17:48] progressing or whatever it was and and
[1:17:52] he said uh there it is on the day of
[1:17:54] Pentecost this is where they the
[1:17:56] Pentecostals failed to see this he said
[1:17:58] that it that the let me give go the Holy
[1:18:01] Spirit may be willing to give them but
[1:18:02] look you were born again of the Holy
[1:18:04] coost this is my brother it was you as a
[1:18:08] child you was just as much as a child as
[1:18:11] you ever could be you were born in a
[1:18:17] family but yet the tutor which is the
[1:18:20] holy
[1:18:21] spirit he said it was touched over the
[1:18:24] church as it's
[1:18:29] maturing so you might be
[1:18:33] born by the blood of Jesus
[1:18:36] Christ but have you found yourself
[1:18:38] positionally placed right there's a
[1:18:41] difference between being a child and
[1:18:43] being a
[1:18:44] son and a rightful Heir that's exactly
[1:18:47] right and this is what he's talking
[1:18:49] about he says now this tutor in the
[1:18:51] natural went to the father and said now
[1:18:52] here this boy's not going to be doing
[1:18:54] very good I'll try to teach him but he
[1:18:56] won't
[1:18:58] listen how many times we see that around
[1:19:00] the message of the
[1:19:02] hour they try to teach us the word comes
[1:19:05] forth the prophet came forth he told us
[1:19:07] how to live told us what to do how to go
[1:19:09] about it how to get all these blessings
[1:19:11] but we don't
[1:19:17] listen
[1:19:19] ex he was close brother Joe he said he's
[1:19:21] got his own headstrong way
[1:19:23] that's exactly right he just won't
[1:19:26] listen he's he's going to be this or
[1:19:29] he's going to be that and the father
[1:19:31] realizes right then that that boy cannot
[1:19:34] take over his domain that's
[1:19:42] right that's right he said because he
[1:19:45] wouldn't he'd run through
[1:19:47] it you see what's happening here you got
[1:19:50] this this boy that's born into a family
[1:19:51] a child here
[1:19:53] and he's not obedient to the word he's
[1:19:55] not obedient to the teacher or the
[1:19:57] instruction and he says the man looks at
[1:19:59] him the father says I can't give him I
[1:20:01] can't trust him I can't give him this
[1:20:02] domain because if he does the prophet
[1:20:04] said he'll run through it he would
[1:20:06] mortgage the farm he'll sell it off
[1:20:08] he'll drink it up he'll run around so
[1:20:10] what's he gonna do he's going out and
[1:20:11] doing the things of the
[1:20:13] world you see you can't live and do the
[1:20:16] things of the
[1:20:17] world and expect to have the domain of
[1:20:20] Christ in your life it will not work
[1:20:26] you'll never be BL he said but this boy
[1:20:28] after he got to a certain
[1:20:30] age you see after he got to a certain
[1:20:33] age you see this tutor had a job to
[1:20:36] do are you with me this tutor had a job
[1:20:40] to do it was his job to teach to
[1:20:45] reveal exactly what the father expected
[1:20:49] of his
[1:20:51] son oh we've had a tutor in our age
[1:20:54] we've had a tutor in our age and a lot
[1:20:57] of times people want to look and they
[1:20:58] want to look back at at at the message
[1:21:00] of the hour they want to look at the
[1:21:01] gifts they want to look at look at the
[1:21:03] the discernment and those were all good
[1:21:06] and we needed those because it
[1:21:07] encourages us and it lifts us up and I
[1:21:09] believe we'll see it again and we
[1:21:10] already are seeing it in our day but
[1:21:12] there was more it was the mystery of the
[1:21:15] will of God is what the prophet was sent
[1:21:17] for it was to show you that you're not
[1:21:19] just a child of God you're not just
[1:21:22] saved by the blood of Jesus Christ now
[1:21:24] you're stepping into a position of
[1:21:26] ownership and you're stepping into a
[1:21:29] position of a domain and you now got the
[1:21:32] authority of Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ that's rich now I'm telling you
[1:21:36] that's whole milk right
[1:21:38] there if you can't handle it we'll have
[1:21:40] to
[1:21:42] stop but I believe we're living in a day
[1:21:44] when you're going to see The Acts of the
[1:21:47] Apostles all over again I believe it
[1:21:51] today more than I've ever believe did in
[1:21:53] my life and he says here's this boy he
[1:21:56] said any Minister knows the places of
[1:21:58] the sun he said it was Old Testament
[1:22:00] teaching the father becomes aware now he
[1:22:03] said he becomes aware now that this boy
[1:22:06] was not worthy he didn't dis on him
[1:22:10] aren't you
[1:22:11] thankful you say man I started out this
[1:22:13] when I was 16 years old man I've made a
[1:22:16] lot of mistake since I was 16 years
[1:22:18] old maybe you've only been there for a
[1:22:21] year two years maybe you've only been
[1:22:22] serving God for for 5 years 5050 years
[1:22:25] it doesn't
[1:22:26] matter but he don't disown you until you
[1:22:29] get to that place he just keeps working
[1:22:31] on you he keeps building you he keeps
[1:22:33] sending the tutor your way you keep
[1:22:35] getting an education by the School of
[1:22:37] Hard Knocks if that's what it
[1:22:39] takes and he begins to work on us and
[1:22:41] mold us and build
[1:22:44] us he said why because he couldn't put
[1:22:47] confidence in him he couldn't put
[1:22:49] confidence in him and he has to be
[1:22:52] placed
[1:22:53] he has to be identified he has to have
[1:22:55] the same Authority that his father has
[1:22:58] and that tutor has to show him that and
[1:22:59] tell him that that's
[1:23:02] right he said but there notice his
[1:23:05] father he said the day come when this
[1:23:07] boy maybe been all right and he's a
[1:23:11] worthy man he listened to the
[1:23:14] father he listened to the father he took
[1:23:17] instructions he's a good boy and he said
[1:23:20] the father then will take him out of
[1:23:22] into the public
[1:23:24] street can you imagine you before this
[1:23:26] is Old Testament you go in there and you
[1:23:29] your father's talking to you and as you
[1:23:31] begin to talk and you begin to associate
[1:23:33] with your father and he says what's the
[1:23:34] tutor taught you well he taught me that
[1:23:37] I have to live by
[1:23:39] faith he taught me that God is the same
[1:23:41] yesterday today and
[1:23:43] forever amen he taught me how to be a
[1:23:46] father he taught me how to how to raise
[1:23:49] my kids he taught me how to how to treat
[1:23:52] somebody on the job
[1:23:54] site he taught me how to how to be a
[1:23:56] boss he taught me how to how to how to
[1:23:59] oversee the whole Farm
[1:24:05] Daddy he says let's go out on the street
[1:24:09] I want the whole world to
[1:24:12] know what you've been gone through and
[1:24:16] he says he takes him out there into the
[1:24:18] public Street and they put a a robe upon
[1:24:20] him and they put this robe upon him it's
[1:24:23] a tapestry of the family
[1:24:26] seal oh brothers and sisters aren't you
[1:24:28] thankful you've been sealed in the
[1:24:29] righteousness the righteous robe of
[1:24:31] Jesus Christ that seals you and covers
[1:24:33] you and keeps
[1:24:35] you and Paul saying here that he's
[1:24:38] predestinated to adoption he said this
[1:24:41] son came out there he was no longer like
[1:24:44] a servant to the
[1:24:46] tutor he was
[1:24:51] boss
[1:24:54] man it's
[1:24:57] quiet let me ask you this can God look
[1:25:01] down at you and say that's my
[1:25:06] boss I trust him so much I have so much
[1:25:10] confidence in her she lives the life to

[1:25:17] me she's the boss he's the boss that's
[1:25:21] my son that's it's my
[1:25:23] daughter he's no more under the tutor

[1:25:30] sisters you mean we're going to come to
[1:25:31] a place that we live exactly like God
[1:25:36] did can y'all handle
[1:25:42] this he says and when he says that when
[1:25:44] he says he's just like his father he
[1:25:47] gives him certain things to do and the
[1:25:50] father tells him he says you might go
[1:25:52] take care of this field now and I want
[1:25:54] you to go over here and take care of of
[1:25:57] this or take care of that and I want you

[1:26:04] care of whatever it is go into town and
[1:26:06] pay my

[1:26:13] because now he's adopted into that
[1:26:16] family he's wearing the robe the skill
[1:26:19] of the family crest is on back and not
[1:26:23] only that but he said now his name is on
[1:26:25] the check and his name on the check is
[1:26:28] just as good as his
[1:26:32] daddies brothers and sisters we cry
[1:26:34] today ABA father why because we're under
[1:26:37] the righteousness of the robe of Jesus
[1:26:42] Christ and we become to that intimate
[1:26:44] Place we've come to that intimate place
[1:26:47] and that a place of
[1:26:49] obedience where we can sit out here and
[1:26:51] we can see that the kingdom of
[1:26:53] God and our name is on the
[1:26:57] check that my name your name is just as
[1:27:01] good as Jesus Christ that's
[1:27:05] right that's EXA when you begin to think
[1:27:08] about that that that gets that just
[1:27:10] almost is
[1:27:12] mindboggling that you can be trusted
[1:27:14] enough but in the beginning that's the
[1:27:17] way it was and the word tells us that
[1:27:18] all that God was he poured into Jesus
[1:27:20] and all that Jesus was he ped what into
[1:27:23] the church how many's in the church this

[1:28:14] is waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:28:16] Son of God it's waiting for the church
[1:28:18] to become into its position who was the
[1:28:21] son of God and Adam what was his domain
[1:28:24] the Earth he had domain over the Earth
[1:28:26] is that right he said Elohim he said
[1:28:30] that is I am God he said he was Elohim
[1:28:33] but now he's
[1:28:35] Jehovah and he said when he became
[1:28:37] Jehovah that is I am God and I've made
[1:28:39] some lesser ones under
[1:28:43] me lesser
[1:28:47] ones there's lesser ones under him in
[1:28:49] Africa in Asia
[1:28:53] Australia Kentucky Tennessee Arkansas

[1:29:05] Arkansas but he's made him to have
[1:29:08] dominion on this Earth he said man had
[1:29:11] dominion and whole creation is waiting
[1:29:13] to see the manifestations of the Son of
[1:29:15] God before when he called himself Elohim
[1:29:18] he was the self-existing one himself he
[1:29:21] said he was the self-existing one that
[1:29:24] that only nothing existed before him and
[1:29:26] there was no existence ever uh before
[1:29:29] him he was all that was in existence all
[1:29:32] sufficient all powerful allmighty
[1:29:35] self-existing
[1:29:37] one he said but in Genesis when he made
[1:29:41] man he said I am
[1:29:44] Yahweh I am Jehovah he said I am Jehovah
[1:29:48] what did that mean he says it means that
[1:29:50] I am the all exist one who has created
[1:29:53] something off of
[1:29:55] myself and he begins to hand this down
[1:29:58] over time and over time I'm I'm the
[1:30:01] self-existing one who now has created
[1:30:03] something off of myself to be a son of
[1:30:05] mine to be temporary or an amateur a
[1:30:09] little one of mine he said aren't you
[1:30:12] thankful to say I'm glad I'm a little
[1:30:14] one of Jesus I'm a little one of God
[1:30:16] thankful I thought about that I thought
[1:30:18] word the scripture says suffer not the
[1:30:19] little ones to come unto me suffer not
[1:30:23] the little ones to suffer the torment of
[1:30:25] this world suffer not the little ones to
[1:30:28] be beat down by the
[1:30:29] devil the little one the little God and
[1:30:33] Jehovah says it means he gave man to be
[1:30:36] an amateur and he said he isn't the
[1:30:38] self-existent one anymore but he exists
[1:30:40] with his
[1:30:42] family Jehovah the one who exists with
[1:30:46] his
[1:30:48] family I'm so glad I'm a
[1:30:52] part of the family of
[1:30:56] God it's more than just being a child
[1:31:00] it's being a son or being a daughter and
[1:31:02] he says here brother brothers and
[1:31:04] sisters he says that the man was made to
[1:31:07] predominate over the Earth to have
[1:31:09] dominion he said if it was it was his
[1:31:12] domain that it was God over the Earth he
[1:31:14] could speak and it would be so if he
[1:31:17] could speak this and it would be so and
[1:31:18] oh here he is god Jehovah the one who
[1:31:21] once existed in self-existence now
[1:31:24] exists with his family and his little
[1:31:26] ones with
[1:31:31] him God is trying to place his church in
[1:31:35] a
[1:31:37] position are you with me this
[1:31:41] morning adoption he says placing
[1:31:43] manifesting taking them out of here and
[1:31:46] putting a ceremony on him visiting him
[1:31:47] with an angel tell him something he said
[1:31:51] I mean manif Stations of the sons of God
[1:31:54] when God manifests himself and
[1:31:58] sends him
[1:32:03] out why is it we want to sit around as
[1:32:08] Believers why is it we don't want to be
[1:32:10] God In
[1:32:12] Action because the word here says that
[1:32:15] once he goes down there he says manifest
[1:32:17] I mean he manifests himself and he sends
[1:32:20] him out he goes for and he says what is
[1:32:23] truth and he lives what is truth and he
[1:32:27] does what is truth he's manifesting
[1:32:30] Christ he said that's how you know who
[1:32:32] he is by his word and by his actions you
[1:32:35] know that he's a son or daughter of
[1:32:39] God he says we have to enforce he says
[1:32:42] we've got the privilege to enforce upon
[1:32:43] Satan the claims that God has given us
[1:32:46] for God has a law and his word is Law
[1:32:49] and God made certain to claims to a
[1:32:51] church that therefore we have a right to
[1:32:53] force claims on Satan I say give it back
[1:32:56] we talked about this last week now we've
[1:32:59] got Authority because now we've been
[1:33:01] robed in the right Satan has no no
[1:33:04] position but to cash
[1:33:11] it how many wants to write checks on
[1:33:13] Satan you owe

[1:33:18] happiness you owe me my children on you

[1:33:26] no Satan owes
[1:33:28] us and by the authority that God has
[1:33:30] given us to come and see this in
[1:33:32] manifestation the life that was in this
[1:33:35] it it it requires a claim to be put on
[1:33:37] the things that Satan has
[1:33:45] stolen listen to this having made known

[1:34:09] what you can have and what you can't
[1:34:12] have and according to his good pleasure
[1:34:14] which he hath purposed Heath purposed
[1:34:16] this himself before the foundation of
[1:34:19] the world
[1:34:22] and he says God likes to work through
[1:34:28] man it gets better he said if God's
[1:34:31] programmed to work through man do you
[1:34:32] believe that God works through man he
[1:34:35] said he made man his helper on
[1:34:43] Earth you mean to tell
[1:34:45] me brother Tommy you are God's
[1:34:50] helper you're God's helper Caleb you're
[1:34:53] you're God's helper on Earth that God
[1:34:56] thought so much of you that he wants to
[1:34:58] work through man so much that he makes
[1:35:00] you your helper that he trusts you and
[1:35:02] has enough confidence in you that
[1:35:03] wherever you go you're going to do what
[1:35:05] he wants you to do that when you're at
[1:35:07] school you're going to you're going to
[1:35:09] talk and you're going to act and you're
[1:35:10] going to be what you should be as a
[1:35:11] young child and a school when you're on
[1:35:14] your job you're going to treat people
[1:35:16] right you're going to treat them just
[1:35:17] like Jesus would helpers on Earth
[1:35:23] am he says he was a savior he was a king
[1:35:26] he was a God he says that's what he was
[1:35:29] he was the attributes of father son Holy
[1:35:31] Spirit not three Gods but three offices
[1:35:34] in him and these are be displayed their
[1:35:36] selves the attributes of God that was in
[1:35:38] him in the beginning and God made his
[1:35:41] man in his own image and put him on
[1:35:42] Earth as a Lesser God and he said is it
[1:35:46] not written in your laws that ye are
[1:35:49] Gods wow you said you're putting a lot
[1:35:52] of authority on
[1:35:56] us depends on where you want to be in
[1:35:58] the
[1:36:00] word it depends on how you look at
[1:36:02] yourself in the word you know there's
[1:36:04] people that look at themselves in the
[1:36:05] word and they look at themselves always
[1:36:07] as the one that's beat down and and held
[1:36:09] back and the ones who who can't go
[1:36:10] anywhere there's other people look at
[1:36:13] themselves in the word and they see
[1:36:14] themselves as as as as
[1:36:17] Overcomers where do you see yourself in
[1:36:19] the word I see myself do an amate your
[1:36:22] God as a creator with authority and
[1:36:24] power why because I'm trusting that I'm
[1:36:26] living with the spirit of God in Me and
[1:36:28] God is satisfied with the life I'm
[1:36:30] living that he can trust me and have
[1:36:33] confidence in me and he can have
[1:36:35] confidence in you to Turn You
[1:36:43] Loose what Adam lost Jesus proved he had
[1:36:47] restored he stopped
[1:36:50] nature
[1:36:52] you know not since Adam was there many
[1:36:54] many acts like that and I you know I
[1:36:57] made this I make that statement and I
[1:36:58] got to thinking about
[1:37:00] it he said he stopped nature he he
[1:37:03] raised the dead he done
[1:37:06] everything but not since Adam had full
[1:37:09] control in the Garden of Eden has any
[1:37:11] been anybody been able to take full
[1:37:13] control of the entire Earth around them
[1:37:16] until Jesus came on the scene now we
[1:37:19] look back in the Old Testament and we
[1:37:20] see some of these old Testament Heroes
[1:37:22] and and Patriarchs we see Moses and can
[1:37:24] you imagine Moses and and Joshua and
[1:37:27] Gideon and Samson and David they all had
[1:37:29] special instances where God moved in
[1:37:31] their
[1:37:32] lives what was that Moses stood there he
[1:37:36] didn't stand there and say oh my name is
[1:37:38] Moses par the
[1:37:40] sea he stood there under the authority
[1:37:43] that had been given to him because God
[1:37:45] trusted him because he had a backside of
[1:37:47] the desert experience and the Holy
[1:37:50] Spirit incompass us body that's how
[1:37:53] David could take down Giants he stood
[1:37:55] under the authority of God
[1:37:59] Almighty but
[1:38:01] now the world is
[1:38:04] groaning he said it's groaning for God
[1:38:06] to get into his children again in
[1:38:10] realities he said to make things
[1:38:14] real and it stumbles the people I'm
[1:38:18] going to tell you it stumbles the people
[1:38:19] around the message
[1:38:23] can you imagine how God stepped into
[1:38:25] Moses when Moses said part the sea and
[1:38:28] the sea party can you imagine how real
[1:38:30] that became to the people that day but
[1:38:33] how was it when they got on the other
[1:38:35] side should we return to
[1:38:39] Egypt h it stumbles the people they can
[1:38:44] accept God In Action when they need him
[1:38:46] but they can't accept God In Action in
[1:38:48] an everyday life and brother and sisters
[1:38:51] we got to get beyond that we got to get
[1:38:54] beyond God in a time of trouble right
[1:38:57] and we got to get to where a God lives
[1:38:58] in my life he's more than a God in a
[1:39:01] time of
[1:39:05] trouble you're listening into the
[1:39:08] preaching of the of the fifth seal
[1:39:10] brother rand's preaching the fifth seal
[1:39:12] and he gets to about the 20th
[1:39:14] paragraph and he begins to talk about a
[1:39:16] little girl that's dying of
[1:39:19] Leukemia and he begins to talk about
[1:39:21] this little girl he said you know this
[1:39:22] little girl they brought her to me said
[1:39:23] she was pretty much I'm paraphrasing now
[1:39:26] he said she was pretty much withered
[1:39:27] away said she hadn't eaten and the
[1:39:30] doctors had pretty much giving her up I
[1:39:32] guess this little girl and and he says
[1:39:34] she was just a just a a sight to see and
[1:39:37] he said that so much that they had
[1:39:39] started giving her intravenous
[1:39:42] feedings and then he goes on say I'm not
[1:39:44] in the medical field so I don't really
[1:39:45] know how to explain what that means but
[1:39:47] I'll tell you what it
[1:39:48] means when you go through and you're
[1:39:50] starting to get tpn through your veins
[1:39:53] that means there's no hope for you to
[1:39:55] ever eat
[1:39:57] again they're sustaining you off of
[1:39:59] elements off of electrolytes off of
[1:40:01] proteins off of carbohydrates through a
[1:40:03] fluid put it into your veins because
[1:40:05] your stomach can't handle food you can't
[1:40:09] process food and here sits this little
[1:40:12] girl sitting here eat up with
[1:40:15] leukemia and he said they brought her to
[1:40:17] to me and and they brought her in the
[1:40:19] crowd and they told her where to sit and
[1:40:20] and and how the service would go pretty
[1:40:22] much and said that little girl hadn't
[1:40:25] eaten in in in days and years maybe
[1:40:27] months I don't know he didn't say but
[1:40:29] said she was sitting there he he began
[1:40:31] to pray for this little girl with
[1:40:32] leukemia and said before they left she
[1:40:35] started to cry I want
[1:40:40] hamburger and then he said when before
[1:40:42] they got home she ate all of her
[1:40:45] meal and he said in days she went back
[1:40:49] and she went back to school
[1:40:52] and this little girl she goes back and
[1:40:53] she enters back into school and he says
[1:40:55] so they took her to the doctor and the
[1:40:58] doctors were so amazed they looked at
[1:41:01] her and said there's not even a single
[1:41:02] trace of leukemia in your
[1:41:06] [Applause]
[1:41:10] child he said now that's instantaneously
[1:41:13] on the mark the power of An Almighty God
[1:41:16] listen to this next statement just blows
[1:41:18] my mind he says that God can go and take
[1:41:22] into the bloodstream cleanse it out like
[1:41:25] that and then put the
[1:41:29] pulsation of a new
[1:41:33] life back in
[1:41:35] there the old Heaven and the old Earth
[1:41:38] will pass away there'll be a new Heaven
[1:41:41] and a new Earth and he said I thought it
[1:41:44] was just so amazing when he said the
[1:41:45] pulsation what is a pulsation it's life
[1:41:49] this little girl that was dead and had
[1:41:50] no no hope and doctors had given up
[1:41:52] feeding her through IV
[1:41:54] tubing now she eats a hamburger
[1:42:01] now she goes to school now there's no
[1:42:04] trace of any kind of you said well that
[1:42:07] was in brother brandom's day I tell
[1:42:10] you if I hear that from somebody we're g
[1:42:14] to have a
[1:42:16] talk because brother Brandon didn't come
[1:42:19] to say let me show you what can do to
[1:42:21] this little girl he never come and said
[1:42:23] let me show you what I can do to this
[1:42:25] blind man let me show you what I can do
[1:42:27] to this dead body he come and said let
[1:42:29] me show you what you can do through the
[1:42:31] power of the Holy
[1:42:33] Ghost his life brothers and sisters was
[1:42:35] an example of what God is expecting out
[1:42:38] of us that's right you're saying you're
[1:42:40] saying every one of us is going to heal
[1:42:41] heal that sick every one of us going to
[1:42:42] raise dead I don't know maybe we will
[1:42:45] it's the same
[1:42:46] spirit it's the same spirit that was in
[1:42:49] the beginning in the logos it's the same
[1:42:51] spirit that fell down the day of
[1:42:53] Pentecost so why am I to limit what God
[1:42:56] can do through me why am I to limit what
[1:42:59] God can do through
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:03] you thank you Lord Jesus who would ever
[1:43:06] thought Tommy richman's gonna get up
[1:43:07] here and give an exhortation like
[1:43:09] that who am I to limit what God can do
[1:43:14] who am I to limit the people that are
[1:43:15] gifted to
[1:43:19] sing
[1:43:23] he said this creative act of almighty
[1:43:25] God to take a bloodstream that was
[1:43:26] contaminated with cancer until this

[1:43:33] and within a few moments time had a
[1:43:36] brand new

[1:43:42] things in our day

[1:45:38] with all the faith that he had within
[1:45:39] him that's good enough for me I believe
[1:45:42] that you're going to see the power of
[1:45:43] God moving amongst the people in a way
[1:45:45] that we've never seen before healing of
[1:45:48] the sick maybe raising of the Dead

[1:46:12] belief and faith is only as good as the

[1:49:55] that the false church with all of its
[1:49:59] cunning and diabolical power and makeup
[1:50:02] of political force and physical force
[1:50:04] and demons of Darkness come against this
[1:50:07] True
[1:50:08] Vine but this True Vine This is what
[1:50:11] he's looking for this True Vine with the
[1:50:14] fullness of
[1:50:16] spirit this True Vine with the fullness
[1:50:18] of spirit and the word will do the very
[1:50:22] acts of power that Jesus did and as
[1:50:25] she's approaching The
[1:50:27] Headstone man we've been building on
[1:50:29] this for
[1:50:31] years we ought to be a little bit
[1:50:33] farther along than the
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:36] basement what are we waiting for
[1:50:38] church what are we waiting for bride
[1:50:41] what are we waiting for in this hour

[1:50:44] going to descend for a bride she's got
[1:50:46] to be somewhat ready to ascend up
[1:50:49] because he's not going to come for an
[1:50:50] incomplete immature
[1:50:55] Bride As She nears her headship she's
[1:50:58] becoming like
[1:51:05] him that's where so many of us fail
[1:51:08] we're so struck on
[1:51:10] ourselves I don't want to be like
[1:51:13] myself I want to be like
[1:51:16] him I don't want to do the things that
[1:51:18] my flesh wants to do
[1:51:21] but I want to do spiritually what he
[1:51:22] wants me to
[1:51:24] [Applause]
[1:51:26] do and Jesus will come that for that
[1:51:28] bride and the groom that may be forever
[1:51:31] United as
[1:51:34] one listen to how it
[1:51:36] happens already the visible
[1:51:38] manifestations of what I've been telling
[1:51:39] you about is seen all around us The
[1:51:41] ecumenical move of the tears is
[1:51:44] factual he said but it's also a fact
[1:51:47] that the prophit for this last age must
[1:51:49] bring forth for a message from
[1:51:51] God that will forerun the second coming
[1:51:54] of the Lord for by this message will the
[1:51:58] hearts of the children be turned back to
[1:52:00] the
[1:52:03] Pentecostal fathers and the restoration
[1:52:06] of the word will come with restoration
[1:52:09] of what
[1:52:11] power so many times people want to get
[1:52:14] back and they want to look back and they
[1:52:15] want to say oh we want to get back to
[1:52:17] Pentecost we want to get back to
[1:52:18] Pentecost if we could just and shout and
[1:52:20] speak in
[1:52:22] tongues that's not the Pentecost it's
[1:52:25] not ausa Street we're looking for isusa
[1:52:28] Street was a genuine Pentecost type
[1:52:32] experience yes they had God moving in
[1:52:34] their presence but we're so far beyond
[1:52:36] in along in our journey brothers and
[1:52:39] sisters than 19 whatever it was 1906
[1:52:42] 1909 when ausa Street happened that's
[1:52:45] not the Pentecostal experience that God
[1:52:47] is looking for God is looking for a
[1:52:50] Pentecostal experience that people will
[1:52:52] be filled with the
[1:52:54] spirit that they will overcome through
[1:52:57] the spirit that the acts will be
[1:53:00] victorious through the spirit that
[1:53:02] healings will take place through the
[1:53:04] spirit listen there when prior to the
[1:53:08] day of Pentecost when the spirit fell on
[1:53:11] the day of Pentecost what were these
[1:53:13] people they were carnally and worldly
[1:53:17] minded they were carnally minded you
[1:53:20] know once they received this end feeling
[1:53:22] that's when they became spiritually
[1:53:23] minded you couldn't think like Christ
[1:53:26] without the Holy
[1:53:27] Spirit no you you couldn't you couldn't
[1:53:30] resist the things of this world the
[1:53:32] carnality of this world without the Holy
[1:53:35] Ghost but when that Holy Ghost fell on
[1:53:38] the day of Pentecost these self-centered
[1:53:41] desire self Desiring lofty people that
[1:53:46] was there on the day of Pentecost they
[1:53:47] lost their self ambition
[1:53:51] they was no longer worried about
[1:53:52] themselves because after Pentecost there
[1:53:55] was a dynamic change that happened in
[1:53:57] their life they didn't live like they
[1:53:59] used to their mindset was changed
[1:54:02] instead of being self-centered they
[1:54:03] became Christ
[1:54:06] centered and the deepest desire was to
[1:54:08] lift up and exalt the name of Jesus it
[1:54:11] wasn't how much money they could make it
[1:54:13] wasn't about how how many cars they
[1:54:15] could own how many farms they could own
[1:54:18] what kind of houses they could have
[1:54:20] it was about Christ and lifted him up to
[1:54:23] a status to where they were concerned
[1:54:25] about living like
[1:54:29] Jesus and the prophet said now listen
[1:54:32] this is where so many this this right
[1:54:34] here I want you to get I'm gonna slow
[1:54:35] down here give me just a few more
[1:54:39] minutes he says we know there must of
[1:54:42] necessity be a return of dynamic power
[1:54:45] he said the believer sense this sensed
[1:54:49] this past tense and their Spirits began
[1:54:52] crying to God for a new outpouring such
[1:54:55] was in the first century he said what
[1:54:57] seemed to be the answer came as many
[1:55:01] begin to speak in tongues and manifest
[1:55:02] the gifts of the
[1:55:04] Spirit it was then believed that this
[1:55:07] was indeed the long awaited
[1:55:10] restoration so the people thought they
[1:55:12] began to
[1:55:13] cry they wanted more of God they wanted
[1:55:15] more of God and they began to cry out
[1:55:17] for God and so then began to give the
[1:55:19] gifts of tongues the gifts of
[1:55:21] interpretation the gifts of dancing in
[1:55:23] the spirit these things is what began he
[1:55:26] said they thought that was the long
[1:55:27] awaited restoration it was
[1:55:32] not when's the last time you heard
[1:55:35] that it was not he said for the latter
[1:55:38] rain came only after the former rain
[1:55:41] which is the spring or the teaching rain
[1:55:44] he said the latter rain then then is the
[1:55:47] Harvest rain how could this be the real
[1:55:50] thing when the teaching Reign had not
[1:55:52] come
[1:55:55] yet the prophet wasn't on the
[1:55:57] [Applause]
[1:55:59] scene who's going to turn the hearts
[1:56:02] back what were they what were they
[1:56:04] trying to get to they were wanting a
[1:56:05] real experience from God they were
[1:56:07] looking for a real experience from God
[1:56:09] and God no doubt moved on the scene he
[1:56:11] said but the prophet messenger who was
[1:56:13] sent to teach to people and turn the
[1:56:14] hearts back he had not yet come he said
[1:56:17] thus he said what was thought to be the
[1:56:20] restoration or the final quickening
[1:56:22] until the Rapture had not
[1:56:29] come why are we looking to
[1:56:32] isua why do we want that why do we
[1:56:35] desire that that's not what we were
[1:56:38] turned
[1:56:39] to he says he says no he says no one
[1:56:42] seemed to realize it he said to prove it
[1:56:44] was not real he said the people he said
[1:56:46] the the tongues would fall he said but
[1:56:48] what about this truth seed he said the
[1:56:50] people of God were being made ready by
[1:56:53] the word of the truth from the messenger
[1:56:54] to this
[1:56:56] age and he said and her and her will be
[1:56:59] the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit
[1:57:02] will bring forth the people right back
[1:57:03] to where they was at the beginning and
[1:57:05] he said and that's thus sayith the
[1:57:08] Lord back to the beginning what are we
[1:57:11] looking for back to the beginning on the
[1:57:13] day of Pentecost
[1:57:14] absolutely let's take note of some of
[1:57:16] those things that happened in the book
[1:57:18] of Acts you say well we generally when
[1:57:21] we first think of the day of Pentecost
[1:57:22] we think of what speaking in tongues
[1:57:25] clothing tongues speaking in
[1:57:28] tongues but that was just the
[1:57:31] beginning that was not the fullness of
[1:57:33] what God was doing the fullness of what
[1:57:36] God was doing was I have left the scene
[1:57:39] I go to prepare a place for you and
[1:57:41] while I'm
[1:57:43] gone you will be me
[1:57:47] in Luke begins to talk talk about this
[1:57:50] at the appearance after Jesus's
[1:57:52] resurrection and we begin to talk about
[1:57:54] it many miracles were performed listen
[1:57:56] to these Peter healed the lame man at
[1:57:59] the temple God answered Peter in a
[1:58:01] miraculous earthquake ananas and Safar
[1:58:04] were slain by the Lord signs and wonders
[1:58:06] continued to be done by the apostles
[1:58:09] Peter healed many from
[1:58:11] various cities prison doors were
[1:58:18] opened signs this is all in the book of
[1:58:21] Acts I can give you all the chapters if
[1:58:23] you want them the Lord appeared to Saul
[1:58:26] but Saul is UN was unsaved and responded
[1:58:28] to the preaching of the Gospel by an an
[1:58:31] ananas and ananas healed Saul's
[1:58:34] blindness Peter
[1:58:35] healed and jela Peter raised Dorcas from
[1:58:39] the
[1:58:41] dead did anywhere you see speaking in
[1:58:44] tongues and
[1:58:45] dancing and
[1:58:48] shouting and
[1:58:50] interpreting no this is the AXS of Jesus
[1:58:53] Christ this is the axe that we're
[1:58:55] talking about he said Cornelius saw an
[1:58:58] angel he and his family spoke in tongues
[1:59:01] they were saved by responding uh to the
[1:59:03] preaching of the Gospel of Peter Peter
[1:59:05] saw a vision on the roof and spoke out
[1:59:07] with the Lord prison Gates were opened
[1:59:10] Paul blinded
[1:59:13] elmus I listened to that story and I
[1:59:15] began to look I thought you know I don't
[1:59:17] recall that story how have I missed that
[1:59:19] story but you look in the in the book of
[1:59:22] Acts in Chapter 13 it talks about when
[1:59:24] Paul goes into to a land there there's a
[1:59:26] certain sorcerer a false prophet named
[1:59:29] bar
[1:59:30] Jesus and he says he was the deputy of
[1:59:33] the county and it says that he he was
[1:59:36] there to hear uh there was another one
[1:59:38] there who was a prudent man who
[1:59:40] was called to hear the word of God Watch
[1:59:44] What Happens here the two Spirits are
[1:59:46] always
[1:59:48] together one is fighting the other so
[1:59:51] here's this of
[1:59:53] God he's designed to hear the word of
[1:59:56] God and this
[1:59:58] sorcerer with stod him and tried to turn
[2:00:01] him away from the
[2:00:03] faith you think Satan don't work in our
[2:00:08] lives you think he's not there at your
[2:00:10] every move and your every question and
[2:00:12] your every desire and wants to try to
[2:00:14] turn you no it may be a friend or a
[2:00:16] so-called
[2:00:17] friend this stands by beside you and say
[2:00:19] you don't want to go there but in your
[2:00:22] heart you're Desiring that's why we need
[2:00:25] the Holy Ghost and here Saul which is
[2:00:28] Paul filled with the Holy Ghost it says
[2:00:31] he set his eyes on him you see what the
[2:00:34] Holy Ghost will do when evil becomes
[2:00:36] lurking around and it begins to try to
[2:00:37] get in there and gets with uh takes a
[2:00:39] Vengeance against some of God's children
[2:00:41] the Holy Ghost will set his eyes on
[2:00:44] am it doesn't matter if it's Paul it
[2:00:47] doesn't matter if it's if it's if it's
[2:00:49] Peter James John
[2:00:51] Matthew Brad
[2:00:54] Bobby it doesn't matter what your name
[2:00:56] is but if you got the spirit of God it
[2:00:59] begins to set its eyes upon the enemy
[2:01:01] and as he set his eyes upon the enemy
[2:01:03] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[2:01:05] said he took a mischief and he said oh
[2:01:08] thou child of the
[2:01:10] devil and he called him out thou child
[2:01:14] of the devil thou enemy of all
[2:01:18] righteousness
[2:01:24] and he put his eyes upon
[2:01:27] Him wilt thou not cease to pervert the
[2:01:30] right ways of the Lord and he calls this
[2:01:33] guy
[2:01:34] out and he says behold the hand of the
[2:01:37] Lord is upon thee he didn't say I put my
[2:01:39] hand upon you no but he was filled with
[2:01:42] the Holy Ghost so he was speaking with
[2:01:43] authority through his own lips and he
[2:01:46] said the hand of the Lord is upon the
[2:01:48] and thou shalt be
[2:01:52] blind and you shall not see the Sun for
[2:01:55] a
[2:01:56] season that's what happens in the book
[2:01:59] of
[2:02:00] Acts that's the kind of H Paul heals a
[2:02:03] man Paul heals a woman possessed
[2:02:05] of evil spirit miraculous earthquake
[2:02:07] loosen the chains in the doors of the
[2:02:09] Philippian prison in Ephesus 12 men
[2:02:11] speaks in tongues and prophesize Paul
[2:02:14] performs other miracles in
[2:02:16] Ephesus Paul raises from someone from
[2:02:19] the dead Paul's not affected by the
[2:02:22] Viper my fit's not broke when the bush
[2:02:25] hog falls on
[2:02:27] it you say why you keep referring to
[2:02:29] brother Tommy because brother Tommy
[2:02:30] keeps telling us
[2:02:32] [Applause]
[2:02:34] testimonies God in action
[2:02:38] brothers and
[2:02:40] [Applause]
[2:02:41] sisters what a marvelous time he says in
[2:02:44] a promise in his Bible here and he says
[2:02:47] it's impossible for him to lie therefore
[2:02:50] if it's promised in the Bible We Believe
[2:02:52] It soul body and spirit it's impossible
[2:02:55] for him to lie if there's any fault it's
[2:02:57] in
[2:02:58] [Applause]
[2:03:01] us it's not in God that's right you
[2:03:05] can't blame God for the things you're
[2:03:08] going
[2:03:09] through God is obligated to his word and
[2:03:13] he has sworn by his word so it's not God
[2:03:17] failing if there's any f it's going to
[2:03:19] be pointing back at us I'm not living
[2:03:22] the way I should live therefore God
[2:03:24] can't work through me that's
[2:03:30] right I'll tell you the closer I get to
[2:03:32] God the more God
[2:03:35] uses amen that's in all aspects of your
[2:03:40] life I listen to a lot of lot of
[2:03:42] preachers around the message I
[2:03:45] listen to a lot of things that's going
[2:03:47] on because I think with current times we
[2:03:49] have to know what that God is doing in
[2:03:51] other other
[2:03:56] places other churches it's the same
[2:03:58] things that's happening
[2:04:07] here he said a few nights ago in a
[2:04:10] prayer meeting a man said to me the Holy
[2:04:12] Ghost wasn't given but only 10 or 12 on
[2:04:15] the day of
[2:04:17] Pentecost boy that puts laments on God
[2:04:20] doesn't it that don't put that don't
[2:04:23] give us a lot of a lot of Hope or
[2:04:24] ambition and God using us does it but
[2:04:27] the prophet said he said well I said
[2:04:29] well then what about the 120 there was
[2:04:31] at the same time that received it what
[2:04:34] about the 100 what about those down at
[2:04:35] the house of Cornelius when the Gentiles
[2:04:38] received it 33 years later and Paul
[2:04:41] asked and they said have you received
[2:04:42] the baptism of of the Holy Ghost since
[2:04:44] the since you believed and they laid
[2:04:46] hands upon him and they received the
[2:04:47] Holy Ghost setting in the Church of
[2:04:49] Corinth in order and he said he also set
[2:04:52] the church the apostles the prophets the
[2:04:55] teachers the evangelists the gifts the
[2:04:59] healings all of those marvelous gifts
[2:05:02] years and years
[2:05:05] Beyond
[2:05:08] Pentecost let's stand to our
[2:05:11] feet years and years and years Beyond
[2:05:16] cost musicians if you come where do we
[2:05:19] stand this

[2:05:31] places and I turn my music on and I or I
[2:05:34] listen to preaching and I was listening
[2:05:36] to preaching going down the road man I
[2:05:38] got
[2:05:39] excited and I got to thinking about this
[2:05:41] because I've been studying on this and I
[2:05:43] got to thinking about I thought God I
[2:05:44] just want to be what you want me to be
[2:05:46] yes I want the Holy Ghost to live in my
[2:05:49] life I want people to know that the Holy
[2:05:51] Ghost is what's doing the work in my
[2:05:52] life I want the holy ghost in my family
[2:05:55] and then that statement come to me and I
[2:05:57] thought about it I thought God set me on
[2:05:59] fire and let the world watch me burn let
[2:06:02] the world watch me burn as an overcomer
[2:06:04] through the holy spirit let the world
[2:06:06] watch me
[2:06:08] burn as I'm Victorious through the holy
[2:06:11] spirit let the world watch my children
[2:06:13] burn as they on fire for God am that's
[2:06:16] my desire how many wants to be set on
[2:06:18] Fire by the holy spirit this morning and
[2:06:21] how many will look the devil in the face
[2:06:22] like Paul did and set your eyes upon him
[2:06:24] and say watch me burn
[2:06:27] amen amen let's just pray Heavenly
[2:06:30] Father Lord we thank you for this day we
[2:06:33] thank you for this little lesson we've
[2:06:35] had and Lord Jesus we just trust in that
[2:06:38] his encouraging words were spoken and
[2:06:41] identification was taking place to tell
[2:06:44] us who we are in the hour we're living
[2:06:46] in and that we shouldn't put limits on
[2:06:48] ourselves of what God can do through us
[2:06:50] we shouldn't put limits on God that we
[2:06:53] shouldn't put limits on on what you're
[2:06:54] capable of doing that you are still a
[2:06:56] Healer you're still a deliverer you're
[2:06:58] still Victorious you're still an
[2:07:00] overcomer that the very things that
[2:07:02] happen in the book of Acts we'll see

[2:07:06] told us that those very things all the
[2:07:08] healings the the Miracles The Marvelous
