We don't want to have pitchfork religions where we say, "Well, that brother needed that or that sister needed that." But Lord, help me be a heart of a sponge to reabsorb what God has for us this morning. As we invite our precious beloved brother and friend, Brother Joe Adams, to come out this morning, let's sing Amazing Grace. How sweet the sound as he comes out.

He's worthy to be praised. Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, we bow our hearts and our heads to you this morning, Father, and want to thank you for your many blessings to us, Lord. Thank you for allowing us to gather once again, Lord, in your house. Lord, we know that this house is just four walls, but Father, your people is the church. And Lord, we assemble togethers today to allow your word to permeate our hearts, our lives. We invite you, Lord, to come by your word and speak to us. Lord, you see us. You see the trials we've been through, the situations of life that we face, God. You've seen us on the mountaintops. Lord, you see us crying in the valleys, God. But yet, Lord, you're still God. You're still faithful. You're still available. And Lord, we as your children want to hear from you this morning. Pray God you would just come and break the bread of life and speak to us as only you can. Lord, I just pray for every heart, every life that's here today. Lord, at the sounding of my voice, may you just speak to him, Lord. Be with brother Glenn there in the hospital. Father, go to him even now. Touch him in his body, Lord. And those that couldn't be here this morning, God. May you just attend to them and to their needs in a special way. Father, we be careful this morning to give you all the honor and the glory for we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. If you have your Bibles this morning, we're going to learn or not learn, we're going to turn to Jeremiah 29 and verse 11-14. Just happy to be back with you again this this morning. This today and for a few days this week we'll be here. We bring you greetings from brother Tim and the saints here at Evenlight Tabernacle. Brother Tim says to send his greetings and so we're happy to be with you this morning. We always look forward to coming back to Elton, Kentucky. I'm not sure you can understand why, but we have a precious little daughter that's here and it's always great to come and to spend some time with her and we don't want to be uh too forward with our visitations and we try to limit that, but we are happy to come and be a part. And as I was telling brother Thomas in the back, it's twofold. We get to spend time with her. We also get to spend time with you. So, we're happy to be here. But today I just want to share what the Lord has laid on my thought or on my heart rather. And this evening, brother Tom, if if it's okay, I'd like to kind of take the evening service and direct it toward the young people. And then we'll pick back up on this thought again Wednesday night. So you have a purpose and a reason for being here Wednesday night if you typically don't come on Wednesdays. So part two of the thought today is going to be us uh we're going to Lord willing now we'll we'll speak it on Wednesday night so we don't get it all today. But I want to kind of direct this evening to the young people. I know some of you about to go to the TWT camp and I just kind of want to send you off if I could with you know some uh some good word if the Lord permit. But this morning I want to speak to you on the eternal thoughts of God materialize in a word bride. The eternal thoughts of God materialize in a word bride. Now, by a show of hands, how many of you've been saved within the last year? Last five years, raise your hand. Last five years, you've been saved. You got saved. Give your heart to the Lord. Last 10 years, 15. Keep your hand up, everybody. Keep your hand up. 20 years, 25, 30. Let's go on the 50 years, 60 years. All right. So almost every hand should be open or up in the air by now. So now as I preach this thought to you today, the eternal thoughts of God. Now that word eternal means no beginning and no end. &gt;&gt; So some of you was in the last 5 years, last year, last 10 years, 50 years, but to God it always was. So we want to take this in Jeremiah 29:1 says, "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall you call upon me, and you shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and you shall seek me and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart, and I will be found of you, sayaeth the Lord, and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whether I've driven you, sayeth the Lord, and I will bring you again into the place whence I cause you to be carried away captive. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. Brother Joe, I want to give you a special greeting. Happy birthday. &gt;&gt; You make 60 look good. If that's possible, &gt;&gt; I'm just on your coattail. I'm at 50. I just turned 50. So, I think 50 and 60 is the new 20 and 30. How about that? &gt;&gt; I enjoyed those specials for the the young ladies that came up and sang that song. You know, if God did it then, he can do it again for us today. And thankfully he gave us one more day. &gt;&gt; You know, he gave us another day to serve him, another day to worship him, to be to come to the revelation that we are the sons and daughters of God. So we look here though, I want to kind of build this thought because it's going to be a two-part series if we can tonight or this morning rather and Wednesday night. The eternal thoughts of God materialize in a word bride. And we look here many times we think of Jeremiah 29. and I know the thoughts that I think of you and it's, you know, it's warm and it's comforting and it's encouraging. But it's deeper than that. It's much more than just, you know, a just blanket little statement. You know, here God is speaking to Jeremiah. Jeremiah being what we call the weeping prophet. And, you know, Jeremiah, I'm actually going through the book of Jeremiah now. And we find God becomes personal to Jeremiah. He says, "I know the thoughts that I think toward you." you know, thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end. And you take this word thought here and you look it up in the Webster's dictionary and it means an individual act or product of thinking, a developed intention or plan, an intellectual product or the organiz organized views and principles of a period, a place, a group or an individual. So we look at it and we think well it's just an idea. But when you take it and you look at it in the Bible and the terminology and you trace the Greek word back, it actually means a purpose and a plan. &gt;&gt; So we can look at what God is telling Jeremiah. I know the plans &gt;&gt; that I have for you. &gt;&gt; I know the purpose &gt;&gt; that I have for you. And can I tell you this morning, some of you raised your hand 5 years, 10 years, 11 years, 25 years, 30 years, 50 years. But yet, God has always had a purpose. God has always had a plan for you and for your life and for bringing you here today. &gt;&gt; I know the thoughts. I know the purpose. I know the plans. You may have not known the purpose. You may have struggled with the plans of God, but God has always known why he brought you to this hour, to this age, to this church, for this purpose, for this reason. Because God is going to manifest. God is going to materialize the very thoughts that he had of you way before you gave your heart to the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, you were in God's thinking. &gt;&gt; So, the purpose and plans of God Yes. &gt;&gt; Originated in the very mind of God. &gt;&gt; How many builders do we have here this morning? People that build. Man, y'all scared this morning. Two of us. Tommy. All right. We got Okay, we got a That's okay. Put your hands up high. My goodness. I ain't going to call you out. But as you begin to build something, it starts right here. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It's a thought in your mind. You begin to to draw it out and then you begin to engineer it and all these things are intricate details. It all lays in your mind and you begin to put it on paper and it becomes a blueprint and then that blueprint becomes materialized and it becomes walls and it becomes this and it becomes flooring and it becomes the the paint, the color, the this, the that, all of it. But it all started at one place. It was in the builder's mind. And can I tell you this morning, you started in the builder's mind this morning. Before there ever was a molecule, before there ever was an atom, you were in the very mind of God, in the very thoughts of God. God had you in his thinking. God had you in his plan. God has a purpose for you this morning. &gt;&gt; You just didn't happen to be. No, God doesn't operate that way. God doesn't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; So, let me just go ahead and tell you, you may have been struggling with your existence. You are not a mistake this morning. &gt;&gt; God purposed you for this hour. God placed you in this hour. God planned for you in this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And think about Genesis. When we look at Genesis, we think about Genesis 1 being the creation chapter &gt;&gt; because the Bible tells us that the world or the earth was without form or void and God be to move on the face of the earth. So we find here in Genesis verse one or chapter 1 verse3, you don't have to turn there. Light was created. Then in verse six, the firminant was created. Then in verse 9, the waters were created. Then in verse 10, the land was created. Grass was created. In 11, animal life was created. Botney life was created. All this was created in Genesis 1. See, God continued to evolve in his creation. But you know the very last thing that God created &gt;&gt; was man. &gt;&gt; Genesis 1 and verse 26 the Bible tells us and God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish and over the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. Notice God had already created everything else. And now he creates man and he sets man to have dominion over all of the other things that he had created. &gt;&gt; Then we find here in verse 27, so God created man in his own image. God already had you in his thoughts. He created a man in his own image. In the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. In Genesis 2 and verse 7, and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. So the earth we find in Genesis was without form and void. And God be to create otherwise, let me say it like this, God be to express his thoughts. Yeah. &gt;&gt; My goodness. I got a skinny jacket on this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you for help. My That's bad when you got T-Rex arms and you can't get a skinny jacket off. Hallelujah. But we find here in Genesis, God begin to express his thoughts in the act of creating. So he would speak, let there be and what he spoke became or as we could say begin to materialize. But before he spoke it, it had to be a thought. And the thoughts that God had, the thoughts that he had, notice, God knew this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. And God be to express this hour in Genesis. All the way back in Genesis, he be to formulate and begin to express himself through a word that he knew that in the very beginning when he said, "Let us create man in our image." He was going to have a bride in Leodosa. &gt;&gt; He was going to have a people that were going to be the very image of God. They were going to be the very word materialized. And many times we find here, let's just go back and we look in Isaiah 55 just to kind of give you some assurance. The Bible tells us, "So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing wherewith I send it." So the word voider means ineffectual. So we understand that the word of God once God speaks his word it will not return to him ineffectual but it will accomplish and the word accomplished means to bring forth and not only brother Thomas will it bring forth but God added an adjective to it he said it will prosper otherwise it will multiply it will be successful it will be profitable God just don't bring something God brings it in abundance God brings it with success God brings it with a knowing that it's going to manifest and materialize in exactly what he declared it would be. &gt;&gt; And brother B will tell us and hear you him. No matter how long it takes to materialize, time doesn't mean nothing to God. &gt;&gt; Now time means something to you. &gt;&gt; Time means something to us. Some of you that's here today that are married, maybe just got newly married and you know five years ago you're like, "Lord, please don't come. Let me get married first. And some of you are probably going, "Lord, please don't come. I want to get married." Come on, church. &gt;&gt; All right, young man. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I got me uh I got Gideon. I got Paul. I got Daniel. And I don't know who you are cuz you're not a hobb. Gersam. That's right. Yeah. But I promise there's something inside of you like, "Lord, please don't come yet." I want to get married. Hey, I was there. &gt;&gt; Tommy, were you there? &gt;&gt; All right, good. &gt;&gt; That's That's the right answer. But time doesn't mean anything to God. We We get bound by time. We get bound by circumstances. Notice God told Abraham, "Abraham, you're going to have a son." And 25 years went by. Time didn't mean nothing to God. It was just a few seconds to God. But nevertheless, Abraham staggered not at the promises of God. And that child arrived just like God said it would because it was a thought in the mind of God. And the word has already been spoken. And the word cannot return void. And so God spoke it to Abraham just the same as God speaking to you that there will be a rapture. That means somebody in this room this morning will take a body change. We'll take a rapture. while the word's been spoken, church, and it will materialize over it. God had already saw you coming and God's already saw you raptured. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Woo! I feel like preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now all we are today is a display of his attributes." &gt;&gt; See, this is God as his own interpreter in case you need it after 63. I know some of us don't like anything prior to 63. He was a prophet all the way from 49 to 65. &gt;&gt; Don't get hung up on the dates. &gt;&gt; But all we are today is a display of his attributes in God first. He was not even God. What? &gt;&gt; You mean God wasn't God? God wasn't God always. &gt;&gt; See, God is an object of worship, &gt;&gt; brother Troy. And there was nothing to worship this god. So what is his first act? Because he had it in his thinking. His first act was to create and he created angels. &gt;&gt; Now angels came and they would begin to worship him and cry holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. That's all that they could do was to worship God. But God wanted more than just worship. &gt;&gt; Brother Joe, God wanted to be loved. God wanted to express himself in love because God is love. And God not only wanted to express himself in love, he wanted to be loved in return just like you and your wife. &gt;&gt; You better love her and you better expect her to love you back or that's not going to be a happy marriage. &gt;&gt; But listen what he says. He says now he wasn't God because the word English word God means an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him. So he was the eternal one the main fountain of all intelligence and in this fountain of all intelligence there was not an atom a molecule or nothing light nowhere star moon nothing else. He said, "God, what we know as God, the great spirit that was eternal, never did begin, never did end. And he was there before the molecule, before the atom, before anything, God was there. And in him was attributes. It was attributes to be God. Then his attributes to be a father, attributes to be a son, attributes to be a savior, attributes to be a healer." All these attributes was in him. And now he says, "And these things that that has unfolded since then are just the attributes being made manifest." &gt;&gt; Then you jump over into God in his own interpret. He goes a little bit further and this is very next quote or very next. Yeah. Very next quote. He says, "What I mean attributes was his thoughts." So in God's thinking, he was going to be a healer. In God's thinking, he was going to be a savior. in God's thinking, he was going to be a husband. So all this was in God's thinking. And he says, "And a word is a thought expressed." And when he said, "Let there be." And there was. &gt;&gt; And you Christians were in his thoughts before there was a world. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And you Christian, you brother, you sister, no matter how young, no matter how old you were, listen to what he says. You were in God's thoughts &gt;&gt; before there was a world. &gt;&gt; So, put the devil in check. &gt;&gt; He's come against you all week telling you you're not going to make it, telling you you can't have it, telling you it ain't for you. You was already in the thinking in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; And you listen what he says. And you are the manifestation of his thinking. Before there was even a world, you were in Christ. Amen. In God in the beginning. That makes you then you see his subjects. The whole thing is God himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled. See the eternal thoughts of God. Let me ask you, this is what brother says. He says, "Let me ask you, are the are the thoughts of God eternal? Are y'all awake this morning? &gt;&gt; Like good. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just I'm tapping the gas a little bit, honey. I ain't going to rev it up just too much just yet. She's like, don't overwork the people all worried about me browbeating y'all. He says, now the eternal thoughts of God. Let me ask you, are the thoughts of God eternal? Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "If you can see this, you will see many things." &gt;&gt; You ever ponder that, brother Tommy? If you can see this, see what? See that the eternal thoughts of God or the thoughts of God are eternal. Because why does he say that? Because if you can see where your beginning is, &gt;&gt; then you can see that nothing the devil throws at you is going to prosper. And if you can see this, you'll see many things, you can see the opening of the word, you can see your place in the book, you can see your place in this hour, in this age, not going down in defeat, but going up in victory. And if you can see that the thoughts of God are eternal, let me tell you, you see yourself in the lamb's book of life. And can't no devil, can't no sickness, can't no cancer, can't nothing come against you and stop you. Why? because you are just as eternal as God is eternal. Hallelujah. And if you can see this, God's going to show you much more than just that. &gt;&gt; God's going to reveal the word to you. &gt;&gt; God's going to show you who you are. That the rapture is you. Not an event, not a place, not a thing. You are the rapture. &gt;&gt; He ain't rapturing uh ELT Elton, Kentucky. He's rapturing up people out of this church. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's raptured a people, a young people &gt;&gt; and an old people. &gt;&gt; If you can see this, you'll see many things. He said, "God is unchangeable of both essence and behavior." We have studied that and proven that already. God is infinite in his abilities. So therefore, he as God must be omnisient. And if he is omnisient, then he is not now learning, nor is he taking counsel even with himself. Nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge. See, God's not like us. I'm studying daily adding to knowledge or what we would call revelation. That's not God. God doesn't operate that way. He is a fountain of revelation. &gt;&gt; He is the fountain of knowledge. He is a the prophet of God would say he's the fountain of intelligence. So God's not adding. So he says, "Now if he can add to his knowledge, then he's not omnisient." Best we could say is that sometimes he will be, but that is not scriptural. See, he is omnisient. He has never had a new thought about anything. All of his thoughts he has had and always will have. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're not a new thought, church. The things that you're going through are not new. You didn't catch God by surprise. God knew it. God brought you here for it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Notice brother Brown will tell us in the church age, this is in the expedition of the seven church ages, I believe the sman age. He said, "God always had his thoughts of Adam." See, Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed. Then he goes into Psalms 139:15. He says, "My substance was not hid from from thee when I made thee in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. thine eyes did not see my substance. Yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which is a continuous were fashioned when as yet there was none of them. So brother Bam keeps going on. He says now that as I said was not written about Adam but it gives you an idea and a knowledge that the thought was already in his mind. So God had already thought about Adam and the Bible tells us that he and we are fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; So quit looking in the mirror trying to make yourself something else. God fearfully and wonderfully made you. &gt;&gt; No matter how tall, &gt;&gt; all of us tall people say amen. Amen. How short. Come on Austin, say amen to short. You're probably the tallest woman. Well, no. I got Carson back there. He's a giant among us. No matter how tall, how short, how skinny, how big, it doesn't matter. You're fearfully and wonderfully made. God made you that way. We couldn't all be little Joe Adams. &gt;&gt; And the church said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; John, that was a little bit loud. I heard you from here. Thank God we're not all carbon copies of one another, but God knows what he's doing and he placed us all here. He says, "So when Adam was formed of the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God, then Adam became God's thought expressed and those eternal thoughts were now manifested. And when you came my brother and when you came my sister and God placed you in this hour, God birthed you into this h while you were the very thoughts of God being materialized for a last day church for an end time bride. God knew he had a word. God knew he spoke it over a people. And God knew there was going to be somebody that was going to catch hold of that word and materialize the very thoughts of God. A bride without spot. A bride without blemish. A church going up in victory. not down in the feet. That's you, church. Quit looking at your failures. Quit looking at your shortcomings and look to what the word says about you this morning. You've already made it. [Applause] We find Moses, Jeremiah, John the Baptist. Each of them, he said they were in God's thoughts expressed in its season. Then came to Jesus the logos and he was the perfect and complete thought express and he became known as the word. But see it doesn't stop there. &gt;&gt; God had more in store. &gt;&gt; More in store. And I'm going to get into it. &gt;&gt; Notice the Bible tells us in Ephesians 1 and verse three. Turn your Bibles there. Ephesians 1 and verse three. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places. According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. So you just didn't happen to be. &gt;&gt; You didn't just stumble off the streets. You didn't just jump off a buggy &gt;&gt; for my Menite Amish friends. &gt;&gt; You didn't just jump off a buggy off a form. No. God had already had you in his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Go. I hope you seeing this clear this morning. Notice what he says. according as he had chosen you when 2025 2024 2020. No, before the foundation of the world, before there was an atom, before there was a molecule, before there was anything to worship him, before he was God, he chose you in himself. Woo! Glory to God this morning. You were chosen there. And if you were chosen there, you're not going to be defeated here. chosen in him. It's one thing if you were chosen in bad and as long as Brad's good, you're good. When Brad goes down, you're down. One other thing to be chosen in Brother Thomas, as long as Brother Thomas is good, preaching that word, oh, but not saying you're going to get off, but let him get off, then you're off. &gt;&gt; But we're not chosen in man. We're not chosen in a church. We're not chosen in a movement. We are chosen in Christ. Before the foundation of the world, before you ever took your first breath, before you ever committed that first sinful act, before anything was ever done, God had already chosen you. And I told you before and I'll say it again. And if God has ever chosen you, Brother Joe, he can't unchoose you this morning. Cuz God doesn't get a better thought. Well, I wished I would have never chose him. if I'd have known he was going to be a rascal. &gt;&gt; God don't work that way. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody say amen to the word. You know it's the truth. Thank God God doesn't operate the way we operate. &gt;&gt; He runs a good business. &gt;&gt; Notice Smyrna Church brother says he had chosen us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world. That means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world. That gives an eternal quality to the elect. You can't get away from it. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're having a good day, bad day, bad week, bad year, bad month, but I'm all here to tell you this is great preaching &gt;&gt; because I'm not preaching my thoughts. I'm preaching what a prophet saying. And a prophet got it from God. He's the mouthpiece. He's the voice of God for this age that come down and lay us to see him. When the world and and our political systems and the age is almost completely uh blacked out by apostasy, God had came down in this age. He interjected himself and he borrowed the body of a seventh grade Kentucky to speak to a bride to tell her, "You came from God. You're going back to God. You always was with me. You never was a dog. You never was a sheep or a pig turned into a sheep. You always was sheep. You always was bride. You always was the elect of God. &gt;&gt; That's what God sent you for. Send a prophet to tell you you always was. &gt;&gt; And if you always was, you always will be. &gt;&gt; If you always was, you always will be. Notice that gives an eternal quality. No beginning and no ending. That's what eternal means. &gt;&gt; No beginning, no ending. Then he goes on. Now listen, Satan's eating. God has attributes in his body. Now, how many of us are the body? And the whole church should raise our hands &gt;&gt; cuz he's the head. We're the body. &gt;&gt; All right. The bride is the body. his body on earth. So God has attributes in his body like you are an attribute of your father and you notice you was in your grandfather's grandfather's grandfather but in that say well said take it down like this you and your father now you didn't know anything when you was in your father he said the germ of life comes from the male the male has the blood the cell the woman has the egg now therefore the blood cell has life in it and when you were in your father you actually know nothing about it but he says but then the Father longed to know you. Oh, thank God. &gt;&gt; He longed to know us. &gt;&gt; And with the union and a connection with the mother, then you were made known to the father. And you are your father's attribute. You look like him. You got parts like your body parts like him. You look like your father. And that's the way God was in the beginning. Every son of God, every daughter of God was in God at the beginning. You don't remember it now, but you were there. He knowed it and he wanted you to he wanted you to come. Notice what he says there so he can contact you. Listen how a prophet drops in God speaking now. He goes he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you love you and shake your hand. God wanting to be personal with his wife, contact you, speak to you and shake your hand. And as parents, we wanted to know when we when we our sp our spouses got pregnant. Some people don't like to use that word in the pulpit, but I mean, good lord, how what else we use? I mean, we got to be so diplomatic and political now, can't even use a word. But when when our when we became expecting, okay, let's put it like that. We wanted to know, well, maybe they're going to break that five foot cycle. Tammy, did you laugh? They going to be taller than five. Look, I was so glad Lauren Mary Weston, my grandchildren, I'm going to put it on record. They have a chance of being taller than 4 foot. It's called breeding, selective breeding. But we wonder, will they be tall? Will they be dark? Will they be hairless? You know, what kind of child am I going to have? Are they going to be bucktooth? Are they going to be ugly? I worried about that. I'm like, God, please don't give me ugly kids. I love them, but I don't want ugly kids. I'm just being honest. Now, y'all don't raise your hand cuz you know you I'm stepping on your toes, daddies. But we wonder what our kids look like. How are they going to be? What kind of personality are they're going to have? What kind of what's going to be their makeup? But see, God already knew this about you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love what he says here. Listen what he says in question answers 1959. He goes, "Oh, isn't it wonderful?" He's talking to brother Mike. I don't know who this brother Mike is. Isn't it wonderful? He loved you. He loved you before there was a world. Brother David, he knew your nature. Tommy, he knew your weaknesses. John, he knew your habits. He knowed all about you, what you was going to be. And then when he looked over all the great universe as it was, and he said, "I choose you." He looked beyond your failures. He looked beyond your faults. He looked beyond your weaknesses. What was he doing? He was looking back in his mind. And he says, "I choose them anyway. I choose them with all their failures. I choose them with all their faults. I choose them because they were in my thinking to begin with. &gt;&gt; He knew all about you. The good, the bad, the ugly. And some of us had more ugly than we did good. He knowed your nature. Now, some of us here this morning, we like mountains. I'm a mountain guy. Okay. Me and me and me. Me and Tommy. Tommy, John. I got me and Tommy John. Some of us like beaches. And all the ladies. Come on, put your hands up. All the ladies in Joe. Ain't nothing wrong with that, brother Joe. I just don't like getting sand in places. I don't want don't want it. Listen what he says though. He says there were some of you. He says there were some here when you come here. He says because the kindness of your heavenly father placed them here. See, because some men likes mountains, some people likes waters, some likes deserts, those that are stupid. I mean, uh, out of their head. Why would you want to live in a desert place? I don't know. Don't go telling your daddy and him, keep it quiet. But you see, some of us like mountains and waters and beaches and deserts. Notice what he says. You see, you're coming. He knew your nature, what you would be, so he made it just the way that you could enjoy it. &gt;&gt; When God was creating in the book of Genesis, God knew the nature that you would have, he knew some of you could only prosper around Kentucky with the rolling hills and the farmlands. Oh, God placed you here. Why? Because he knew your nature. He knew where it would be so that you could prosper in the word. He didn't place you in a desert. He didn't place you on a mountaintop. He didn't place you in the water. He placed you right here. Why? So that you could be the materialized thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; He was going to have a church here. He already planted a church here long before there was a world. and he already moved up on our pastor's heart to accept a invitation to come when there was a little white building. God had you in his thoughts. &gt;&gt; He knew your nature. &gt;&gt; And what are we doing? Materializing &gt;&gt; the very eternal thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can I keep going? &gt;&gt; I'm going to say something here. And please don't take this the wrong way. &gt;&gt; I want to say something. I want you to hear what the spirit will say behind it. And I'm not trying to make myself out to be a prophet. Please don't get that. Don't clip that on the internet. If you got that, then shame on you. You need to repent. But I'm just telling you, I want to share what God's thinking is about you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that the bride when I did a search out there I wanted to find out collectively what's the collected thoughts of brother Brandham and his ministry. What's the collective thoughts? Brother Brandham emphasized that the bride consists of individuals that are predestinated by God before the foundation of the world whose spiritual genes were in God's thoughts from eternity. And we can all say amen to that. See, he taught that we as believers are the expression of God's attributes, chosen to manifest his word and glory. And we can all say amen to that. See, it's always been, and this is what I want to say. This, it's always been about you. &gt;&gt; Didn't fall too good, did it? It's always been about you, me. It's always been about a bride. &gt;&gt; See, I use this term predominant. You know what that word predominant means? Strongest or main element. So, one of the most predominant thoughts that God has had has been you. One of the most prevailing thoughts that God has always had is been you. Well, brother John, I'm struggling with that. I thought it was about a prophet. Many make it to be about a prophet. Many make it to be about special ministries. Many make it about special men that God have used down through the ages. And if we're not careful, that's what the devil wants you to make it. See, he wants you to get your eyes off of you and who he's coming for. Place your eyes on a certain man and we begin to elevate certain men. We begin to elevate certain ministries and we fail to see oursel in the word. &gt;&gt; But when we look here, and I'm going to take you to a scripture we're all familiar with, Malachi 4:5. Behold, I send Elijah the prophet. Oh, do y'all miss that? Some of y'all said, "Amen." I missed a word. &gt;&gt; Put that scripture up there if you would, please. Malachi 4 and verse five. Behold, otherwise take notice. &gt;&gt; Recognize I'm doing something. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send &gt;&gt; you. &gt;&gt; I send &gt;&gt; you. Come on. Don't be afraid. I'm sending it to you. Who am I sending you? I'm sending you Elijah. I'm sending you a messenger. I'm sending you a prophet to do what? Before the great and terrible day of the Lord. And he's going to turn your heart. Turn it away from men. Turn it away from others. Turn it away from failures and turn it back to the word of God. Back to the eternal thoughts of God. I'm turning your heart away from unbelief to believe it again. Hallelujah. Somebody. Glory to God this morning. God sent you a prophet. &gt;&gt; God sent you a messenger. &gt;&gt; It's always been about you. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to share. I'm going to show you. I'm not go I'm not off my rocker. The mystery of God revealed 1963 after the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; He said, "His great mystery of revelation has been revealed." And the bride says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. His great mystery of revelation. Get it? Revelation. He only reveals himself to the elect. &gt;&gt; He is the main one. He being Christ. So in God, he was a healer. There had to be somebody needs healing in he God. Christ Jesus was to be a savior. There had to be somebody to be saved. See these thoughts? He already knew you. And when he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world, where were you? &gt;&gt; You were in him then. &gt;&gt; So he knew you then. And notice now then he goes on, brother Bam goes on to tell us it's a revelation. It's as it's as eternal as God's word is eternal. But look, there's a three-fold purpose of God's great mystery. three-fold purpose. God first of that purpose is God manifested in Christ. Notice here first thing was God wanted to reveal himself to the people. He couldn't do it as almighty God who didn't have a form. He didn't have a a body. So he stepped down into the physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ and he became the physical manifestation the materialized of who he was. And he came in his son Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to pay the price. Cuz look, it took a it took a kisman redeemer. It look when John said no man was found worthy. Let me tell you, there ain't no pope, there ain't no bishop, there ain't no minister, there ain't nobody found perfect. But Jesus Christ stepped out from behind the throne and he took the word and he become the expressed thoughts of God and he saved you and he bled for you and he redeemed you and he healed your body. He did it for us. He's the main thing. &gt;&gt; But he was sent for somebody. He was sent to heal somebody. He was sent to deliver somebody. He was sent to save somebody. Get your eyes off a single man and put your eyes on the word. Notice then Christ second fold of his great mystery revelation Christ manifested in the church. So now brother man would tell us see he wanted to have preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in a people that's his purpose. Notice to do what? The third fold purpose was to restore back Eden. Bring back notice take this fallen Eve and take her back to an Eden condition again. So God doesn't intend for us to live in this state eternally. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; thank God. So God manifested in Christ. Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem that was lost, the lost Eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden. That's the three-fold purpose of God. And can I tell you the predominant, the predominant, the prevailing, the strong thought that God has was about you. You know, it wasn't about sending a prophet, though. We needed a prophet. We needed a prophet that would proclaim the word. But if we're not careful, we get hung up on a prophet. We get hung up on a man. We get hung up on a church. We get hung up on a ministry. It ain't about a man. It's about a bride in this hour. It's about God sending you a prophet to do what? To turn your heart back. It's about you this morning. Everything that God has done, every message that he's ever preached, every man that he's ever sent has been with a bride in mind. I want a bride. She's the express thoughts of God. I want to love her and I want her to love me back. &gt;&gt; It's been about you. His desire wasn't only to say it this way, but it it wasn't solely Jesus Christ. Jesus had to come for somebody. &gt;&gt; We are that body. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; See, God's great desire was not to just be worshiped. He wants to be loved. Now, it'll be nice every now and then if I walked in the room, Brother Tommy, and my wife said, "Welcome home, Lord." &gt;&gt; Sounds good, &gt;&gt; don't it? &gt;&gt; You ain't even sitting with your wife. Boy, mercy. &gt;&gt; Lord, does sound good, doesn't it? Just kidding. I better watch my steps. I have a new south to church after me. But it' be nice, you know. Oh, Lord Adams, welcome home. I know you had a hard day, Lord. Let me wash your feet. No. Come on. We live in 2025. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, I don't want to be worshiped. I want to be loved. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I come home from a hard day, thank God I don't have very many of those anymore cuz I'm full-time ministry. So, that's really great. But you come in and you just, you know, you smell the cooking. Man, she's been slaving away for me. She only been on that microwave for five minutes, but it smells like she' been there for an hour. And you go sit down in your nice recliner and she comes and sits in your lap and kisses you on the cheek. And that's what your prophet said. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that ain't to be worshiped. That's to be loved. &gt;&gt; And that's what God, he wants to be loved. Yeah, we worship him. But if your worship isn't fueled by love, your worship is in vain. &gt;&gt; My wife can sit in my lap and if she don't love me, she's just sitting in my lap and she just a dead weight. But if she loves me and she's kissing me and hugging me and say, "Honey, woo, you looking good today, boy." &gt;&gt; Come on, brothers. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David. I appreciate that. Somebody with me. Josh, you've been awful quiet. I'm going to have to do marriage counseling when we're done. But it's nice to know that you're loved, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And sisters, let's not leave you out. When he's been gone all day and you've been wiping bottoms and you've been cleaning up and you've been cooking and you've been straightening and you just aggravated at the world, you don't you don't want to come in him slinging barking orders and treat you like you're a doormat. No, you want to be loved. You want to know that you're loved. and he comes in and you're in a fouled up mood and he comes behind you and well, we ain't gonna say what all he does because we got kids here. But he changes the atmosphere. See, if he didn't love you, he wouldn't change the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And sometimes that's when come to the house of God, he begins to change your atmosphere &gt;&gt; because some of you came stewed up, &gt;&gt; tore up, tied up, twisted up. ready to turn around and go back home. But you got to get beyond that. And he comes. We want to be loved. And notice we look here in Genesis and we find that God dwelt alone in his thoughts. How much time do I got? Mercy. I got plenty of time. Y'all heard it. &gt;&gt; God dwelt alone with his thoughts. We don't know how long because time wasn't recorded at that time. But you notice after he created all the species, animal life and this and that and everything, there was Adam. And brother Tommy, Adam sat there. He didn't have a helpmate. He didn't have a wife. He didn't have a mate. He didn't have anything. You know what Adam had? Adam had his thoughts. And Adam would look, man, look at that deer. That big buck and that nice dough. I wonder what they communicate about. Or this, this, and this. This one has a mate, and this one has a mate. And no doubt Adam is thinking, how would it be if I had a mate? Man, just someone I can express myself to. These animals, they don't speak my language and I don't speak their language. And what did God do? God said in his own word, it is good for man not to be alone. See, God knew the struggle. &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting this. God knew what he wanted, what was inside of him. And here is his son with the same attributes. I don't want to be alone, but I want to express myself. I want a wife, someone I can love, &gt;&gt; and someone that will love me back. That's why we are here. Do you honestly think that the church system can love him the way he desires to be loved? How can it? They don't have the truth of the word. &gt;&gt; But we do. Notice, I love how Adam would tell us in Genesis 2 and verse 26, the Bible, let's go to verse 21. And God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept. And he took one of his ribs, and he closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib which the Lord had taken from man made he a woman. And he brought her unto man. And Adam said, "This is now bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man." Then in the rising of the sun, your prophet caught the inspiration. Your prophet caught the inspiration. He said, "He being the groom, the bride has to come forth because it's part of him." And it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations in the others that spoke of the bride. It can only manifest if it does something different from the groom. Then it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. She is him, church. That's who we are. We are the very intricate thoughts of God in this hour being materialized. We didn't He didn't pluck you from a denomination. He didn't pluck you from a field. He thought of you in his very thoughts in his mind before the foundation of the world. And he wanted he's always wanted a faithful bride. Listen what he says in the New Testament. Ephesians 5:24. Therefore, as a church is subject unto Christ, so let the wise be to their own husbands and everything. Oh, we don't have no women's live people here. Wise got to be subject. What kind of mess is that? We're in 2025, Brother Joe. Women's suffrage movement. No, that's for them. &gt;&gt; We're not them. She's him. &gt;&gt; Listen. Verse 25. Husbands. All right, husbands. &gt;&gt; Now, he's rebuking you or he's putting it on you. Husbands, love your wives. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She's not a doormat. &gt;&gt; She's not a kicking post. Don't put her under your thumb. &gt;&gt; Understand this is Bible. This is Paul. And we're preaching Paul's message in 2025. Husbands, &gt;&gt; husbands, how many husbands, raise your hands. Husbands, husbands, love your wives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice, even as Christ also loved the church, that he gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word, that he might present to himself a glorious truth. He is wanting and his intentions are to present himself a wife, a bride without spot, without wrinkle, without blemish, without any such thing, perfect within and without. Then he goes on, brother Bam goes on, he says, "God intended this church to be a powerful church, a glorious church, a church that the whole world could look upon as the bride of Christ, well expected and espoused, and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of his church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord." &gt;&gt; He wants a wife. Let me tell you, I got a great wife. If I didn't, she wouldn't be with me on this trip. I got a wonderful wife always, brother John. For 20some years, she has been faithful. When man had talked about me, brother Thomas, she has been there and she has caressed me and care for me and cons consoled me and all these other different things. That's a godly wife. And as a husband, I provide for her needs and her means spiritually, emotionally, physically, all these things. That's our responsibility. &gt;&gt; And if that's in the natural, what about the spiritual aspect with God and his wife? &gt;&gt; I told a church the other day, I believe I was in I was there in South Carolina. I believe our sister was out there with us. I was preaching at all Spanish church. I may have been there. There may have been something else when I left here last. I said, "Man, when I got married, brother brother Brad, I put up a sign. I'm off the market. I'm not looking and don't be looking at me cuz I'm happy with where I'm at." &gt;&gt; And I will tell you, young brothers, you claiming you going to get married and you still looking, you still chatting, you still conversing with other girls, &gt;&gt; you ain't ready. Young girls, you still snapping and chatting and Instagramming and all these other little social media platforms we got with other boys and you claiming he's the one and you bat them little eyes and your heart goes peac. No, but when you know they're the one is when you're ready to take yourself off the market. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the bride is off the market. &gt;&gt; She's off the market. Satan, you can't have her. You can't touch her. She ain't going. She ain't dancing with you. She ain't singing your music. She ain't doing your drugs. She ain't doing nothing. Why? She's off the market. She's been spoken for. &gt;&gt; And he's going to present himself a glorious church. &gt;&gt; Notice he would go on to tell us, brother Random goes on to tell us many, many, many things. And I might have to skip some of this, but I want to hit a highlight. He said, "God never intended, he expected this earth to be inhabited, so he just made a a woman to bring children." He said it still pours the calcium and the pot ash and the elements into them builds them up. Then he brings them a place and lets you make a he brings it to a place and lets you make a choice. So God never he said he never will be defeated. See, if he goes on, he says, "Now if without a choice, God made me one day a young man strong, healthy, happy, and the Holy Spirit, not some cold, formal theological seminary dogma that the devil wants to make our churches today when you can't have a shout in a church. You can't have an amen in the house of God. There's no more altar calls, no more prayer lines." See, he said, "The Holy Spirit is God's program. They begin to woo over me and make love to me and I accepted him and then he came down into my heart and he took his place and is now how much assurance have I got that I that he'll raise me up in the last days. God gave the promise and the Holy Spirit rules the church. &gt;&gt; We don't need man-made leadership. We don't need &gt;&gt; headquarters. &gt;&gt; Every pastor is a sovereign head of the local assembly. Much to somebody's dismay and other people's we think we got to all carbon copy everything the way brother Brandham set up the uh the the church there the Brandham tabernacle that was for Brandham Tabernacle and that is a good structure and statue to have. But if we're going to cherrypick what we can have from how he set up church order, then we need to make sure we do the the uh the Sunday school lesson every morning. We got to give a report every morning. We can only preach 45 minutes. And y'all already blasted me out of the pulpit because I've been way longer than 45 minutes. But we find we cherrypick little aspects how we're going to set our church up. And then when it doesn't fit in other people's mode, they blast us for the way we structure our church. But every church is sovereign. &gt;&gt; And God expects the Holy Spirit to lead the church. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Thomas and I, we're great friends, but we may not see eye to eye on everything, but it doesn't matter. This is his church. And if I see something different, I'm not going to preach something arbitrarily to be different and to be argumentative and to bring confusion. Shame on me if I was to do that. We have to respect the ministry, respect the leadership, respect the church. But the Holy Ghost has placed each of us in the body of Christ. And he says, "And we're helpless to maneuver without every member of the body." So God placed you here. He didn't place you in the Louisiana heat. It is miserable in Louisiana right now. God awful hot, humid. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for that church, I wouldn't be there &gt;&gt; because there ain't nothing else. Louisiana is ugly. &gt;&gt; And the Louisiana people said, "Amen." They're scared to say amen in case this gets streamed. But notice he tells us in first Corinthians he Paul tells us for as a body is one has many members. All of the members of that body being many are one body so also is Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptized into the body. So it's by one spirit that we become into that body. And he provided us a means to become into that body. And brother Bam tells us a story. He says, "Before there was a foundation of the world, he took a picture." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I love what he says in the unconditional covenant that God made with his people. He said when he brings a little baby in the earth, he lets it grow to maturity. He's painting a picture in his great infinite mind. See, that's a young man, a young woman. It's just at its best. And when it's standing there at its best, then he says, "That's right. That's the way I want them in the resurrection. So God at your best. Thank God he didn't wait till I turned 50. Look like a upside down melted ice cream cone. He didn't wait. Don't y'all laugh? All y'all laughing at me like you ain't got your own ice cream belly. &gt;&gt; But he took a picture at your best. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not when you were 19, not when you were 20, not when you were this, not when you were that, but he took a picture of you at your best. And he says the picture is the main thing. See, then in the resurrection, those gases and asses and things come right back into place and develops that picture again. See, now this picture was not taken when you were 16, 18, 20 years old at your best. He says, "When was it taken?" "Before the foundation of the world, it was put on God's great file." &gt;&gt; God took a picture. Not only did he have you in his stalls, he took an image of you. This is going to be them at their best. And notice I'll say this and he goes on to say, "And nothing can destroy that profile or that picture. &gt;&gt; That picture is in God's great gallery up there. It cannot destroy. It's in heaven. You can burn it, feed it to lions, do anything you want to with it. It'll come forth again just as sure as two twos is four." So no matter the trial you're going through, the hardships that you face, nothing can destroy that profile. No matter the sickness that comes your way, whether it be cancer, whether it be heart trouble, whether it be mind battles, depression, anxieties, oppression, nothing can destroy that profile. Satan cannot destroy the thoughts of God because Satan does not have access to the mind of God. And God doesn't share his thoughts with his enemy. God only shares his thoughts with his bride. What am I telling you? I'm telling you, you can't be defeated this morning. You can't be destroyed this morning. Those thoughts of God are eternal. And you're just as eternal this morning as God is. &gt;&gt; So, we find what does God do? God sends the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we understand in Amos 3:7, surely the Lord God would do nothing but what he reveals his secrets to his servants, the prophets. So we understand that God reveals his word to the prophet and the prophet will in hand take that word and hand it down to the believer. &gt;&gt; That's a scriptural order. &gt;&gt; But notice 1963, the voice of God in the last days. A prophet of course is a preacher. A modern word prophet absolute me absolutely means a man that preaches under inspiration. &gt;&gt; A man that preaches under inspiration. What is he doing? He's catching the very thoughts of God &gt;&gt; and he comes and stands behind the pullpit and he begins to share those thoughts with you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not just a vindicated word prophet that we don't preach anything but what a word prophet already preached. And only a prophet can only say what the prophets before him had said. We're preaching the same message that Paul preached. &gt;&gt; He said the God's word is in his spirit and his word comes in his prophet and the word is supposed to transform you from what things of the world are into the image of sons and daughters of God. And the word can only come through these prophets as they spoke. It had to be compared with the word and showed that it was with the word. And if you accept the word, it'll transform you from sons of the world and daughters of the world to sons and daughters of God. And you become the word. You become the word as you receive the word. You become the word. You become the expressed thoughts of God. As you receive the word, &gt;&gt; you can come in here and you can shout and you can do all that and your neighbor sit there hard and and and closed off and not get nothing from the same atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it's based on how you receive the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this word. &gt;&gt; Let me go on to try to bring this wrap this up. He said now his attribute the attribute was first God. So God he had a thought and attribute in itself is all one without being expressed. So he said attribute was first he was a before it was anything it was an attribute it was a thought and it was God and God had these thoughts. This is what he's going to do. So God knew this day as much as he knew the day of creation. Then the second thing what he did he said then he be to express secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we understand the scripture in the beginning was the word and when when time began it was the word but before it was the word it was an attribute of thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the word and he goes into this Melzdc and he said that's a mysterious person because you know what Melzdc he said Melzdc became Jesus Christ and Melzdc came in a word body. You and I bypassed that word body to be tested in the flesh. You say, "Well, why are you bringing in this Melzdc?" Because what he was, we're going back to. &gt;&gt; We won't always be in this body. &gt;&gt; We're going to take on a theophony body, a word body. &gt;&gt; So, let me keep going here. God chose a man and he's speaking about Abraham. God chose a man 50 at 75 years old and a woman at 65 to do his purpose. Remember, purpose is a thought. Why in the world would God pick a man 75 years old and a woman 65 year old to have a baby? Let me let that sit on your brain for a minute, Sarah. Not me. I'm 25 years younger than Abraham and I'm saying us four and no more. We done. Quivers's full. Thank you, Lord. But here, Abraham, 75 years old. Sarah, 65 years old, to do his purpose, to show that you can both be young and old, God can steal and will work out his purpose. And when Abraham was 75, he got the promise of God and he told it to Sarah. Now, notice what the devil did. He said, "Now, now the devil said, you know what? I'm going to I'm going to delay that for a while. I believe if if I'll get them so old, they'll lose faith and they'll they'll not know that it can happen. That's what he does. You God gives you a promise in a service and the devil delay it and delay it and delay it and to delay it to get you to doubt, to get you to have unbelief. He says, "If they've already shaken at 75, if they can if I can get them away for a while, I can keep it away until Abraham and Sarah just was stooped in age, gray hairs, and stooped shoulders." He goes, "It goes to show that nothing can defeat his purpose." &gt;&gt; Not even death can defeat the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Abraham was as good as dead. Sarah's womb had been dead for 40, 50 years. But nothing can defeat God's purpose. Her body was old. It was wrinkled. The milk veins dried up. Her heart was so weak. It could not have went through labor. But God let us know there that his purpose will not be defeated. And he changed Sarah back. What am I telling you church? That I know the thoughts that I think toward you little bride. Thoughts of peace and not of evil. I got a purpose for you. I got a plan for you. And ain't no devil in hell, no old age, no sickness, no cancer will defeat the purpose and plan that God has for you in this hour. God's purpose will not be defeated. &gt;&gt; Musicians come, he says God, he says Abraham could endure it seeing him who was invisible because why? It was the purpose of God that he know that God gave him the promise and no matter how contrary everything seemed, God gave Abraham the promise. So God fulfilled his promise. He did to Abraham. He did it to all his children. He will keep his promise. And can I tell you in 2025, God will keep his promise to you this morning. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's never been defeated. He's never lost a battle. He's never given up. God will reward you for staying with the promise of God. He said, "Hell can't defeat the promise of God." They could have they heated the furnace up seven times hotter. &gt;&gt; It didn't defeat the promise of God. They starve those lines for months. It didn't defeat the promise of God. And they can turn this world upside down. Satan can create his Eden, but it will not defeat the purpose of God. God will have a church. God will have a bride and you are that bride. I know the plans that I have for you. Plans of peace, not of evil, to bring you to an expected rapture, &gt;&gt; an expected body change. It may be unexpected by the world, but for this bride, it's expected &gt;&gt; for this bride. Bible says he can do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think. For this bride, it's expected. All the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the purpose of God. And as last quote, Jesus Christ is choosing his bride just the same way men choose their bride. Now, Gideon, I get to use you because you're my buddy. Maybe one day you want a wife. Nice little girl. Got her eyes on you, Giddy. She make them little bitty eyes. But you know what? As much as she Oh, giddy giddy giddy. She's giddy about Gideon. She's not going to just get up off the pew and come over here and say, "Hey, boy. I like you. I think I'm gonna marry you." That's not how it works, is it? No. No. That's not how it works. Get in. No. The answer is no. Okay, I'm gonna walk you through this. Hold on. But but Christ is choosing his bride the way we choose our bride. Paul, I get to use you now. And you got your eyes like looking far and wide. Where's she at? Far. What are you looking for? Looking for character. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for character. I'm looking for somebody that matches me. somebody that has something inside of them that responds to who I am. And see, that's what Christ is doing. He ain't looking for just any church. &gt;&gt; He's not just looking for any bride. He's looking for that one that was in his thoughts. And maybe Paul, you may have laid in that bed thinking about this one and about that one. thoughts and thoughts and thoughts and thoughts and thoughts and thoughts. But then you begin to look, does this fit the thought? Does this fit the I hope you're picking this up. Does this fit the thought? Does she fit the thought? Does this one fit the thought? Because you have to be in the thought to be in union with him. &gt;&gt; Because he's only coming for those that was in his thinking. So he says he's choosing a bride the same way we choose a bride. Now before I chose my bride, I looked. You know what we call that? Window shopping. But there's got to be a time you quit window shopping and you go inside and make a purchase. I hope somebody's hearing me. You got to quit window shopping because you know this is the one. And can I tell you that's what he did. He's done with window shopping. He's chosen his wife. Listen what a prophet says. And I'll close this out. He said he chooses his bride the same way men chooses their brides today. The bride today doesn't simply decide she's going to take a certain man for her husband. No sir, it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride. John 15:1 16. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. Now, according to the word of God, the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world. The choosing of the bride was purposed in himself. Purpose. Back to thought. See Ephesians 1:9 and in Romans 9:11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand. He goes you can't read it read it any other way. The heart purpose the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world. Then he goes on in the SRA churches and he says he was known only as eternal spirit but the bride was already in his mind. &gt;&gt; You've been chosen to be his bride. You are already in his thoughts. And now we are materializing the very eternal thoughts that God has always had. Can I tell you, take your eyes off your failures this morning. Take your eyes off your struggles, off your sicknesses, off the things that have been pressuring you and bothering you. Look to the word. &gt;&gt; You come from God and we're going back to God. And that's the end of it. We're not listening to a lie of the enemy. We're not going to look at our failures. We're not going to look at family strains. We're not going to look at disappointments. We're going to look to what the word says. And the word has already been spoken over a people. I will have a bride. Let's worship the Lord. Stand up to your feet. Come on, brother David. living in me to tell the world that he is the same. Oh, he's the same yesterday and today and forever. Jesus, he's alive and well. Once again this morning, oh he's alive and well, living in me to tell the world that he is the same. He's the same yesterday and today and forever. Jesus is alive and well. Amen. You enjoy that this morning? Amen. Aren't you glad he chose you this morning? name. Brother Brandham said, "I no longer call you church, but I call you bride." Amen. Let's sing that little song before we go. He's still working on me. Amen. I know a lot of you don't need as much work as I do, but I'm glad he's still working on me this morning, aren't you? Well, he's still working on me. Oh. To make me what I ought to be. Well, it took him just a week to make the moon and stars, the sun and the earth and Jupiter Mars. How loving and patient he must be. He's still working on me. Well, there really ought to be a sign upon my heart. Don't judge me yet. There's an unfinished heart, but I'll be perfect just according to his plan. Fashioned by the master's loving hand. Oh, and he's still working on me. To make me what I ought to be. Oh, it took just a week to make the moon and stars, the sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars. How loving and patient he must be. He's still working on me. And in the mirror of his word, reflections that I see, it makes me wonder why he never gave up on me. He loves me as I am and he helps me when I pray. Remember, he's the potter I'm the clay. Oh, and he's still working on me. To make me what I ought to be. Oh, it took him just a week to make the moon and the sun and the earth and Jupiter. I love you. He must be. Oh, he's still working on me. Amen. You glad he's still working on you this morning? Amen. Is that all, Brother Thomas? Amen. Remember, the service starts this afternoon at 2:30 and uh we're we invite everyone to come and eat. Amen. And Amen. Let's let's just go and have a good afternoon of fellowship and then come back and see what God has for us again. God bless you.
