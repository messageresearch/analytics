[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] morning everybody as y'all can tell we've got some work in progress going on out by the Pavilion and everything uh we've got some new rock out there which praise the lord we got it a month ahead of the meetings but either way what we're going to try to do and what I would like for you to do is nobody go out there today uh walking through the rock brings the dust back in here takes it down to the fellowship building so it makes a pretty large extra cleanup so let's just stay off of that area the basketball court has also got a reinforcement wire on it and some uh rebaring stuff so don't even go over there I guess the only safe thing you could do is play volleyball but if you do that you need to walk in the grass do not get on the Rock okay everybody dear headlight look yeah okay all right I don't brother Steve don't like repeating himself so I'm I'm just trying to get everybody here all at one time and then also you see the tape on the floor U don't be picking it up it's there for a reason we're going to try to change these lights out and that helps us to put the benches back so I'm sure I'm I'm struggling here trying to remember okay uh ping pong table it's folded up in the corner we're not going to play pingpong on carry and Sunday because of food and everything and the way our time schedule runs we don't need to be worried about getting the ball out of the food and doing all that so we're good with that everybody understand that okay all right uh I want to cover gum chewing in the sanctuary that's getting a little bit out of hand so we need to back down on that and then talking out in the forer and Lolly gagging around out there before service what I mean by that is anytime 30 minutes before service and prior to you need to be in here getting ready for service okay hey you know I'll take the blame on this I shouldn't have let it get like it's gotten but I know sometime people like to stand out there and visit with me and brother William as we're doing the door uh and it's gotten out of hand so we need to back back down on it when you come in if you have to go to the bathroom that's fine I mean that's what they're there for get your business took care of come on in the sanctuary and get ready for service it's uh the rules that we go by here is basically how brother brandham set him up I can I can take you to uh to how you had things set up there at the Tabernacle and that's how he felt and that would be pleasing and how he wanted things set up for the people and I think you'll profit from if you'll if you'll get in here and sit down and get ready for service you'll profit for you know so it's not just rules and regulations it's it's for furtherance of of you being prepared for the sermon and everything so U can't really think of anything else brother thank you brother John okay uh it's been brought to my attention the children even on Wednesday nights everything and I'm not picking on kids okay uh y'all are running everywhere I wished I could uh I do good to walk everywhere but uh on Wednesday nights we're getting down here in the parking area and we're running and playing that's great it's just you're not supposed to be doing it let's stay up here by the building and whenever the Rock and stuff get uh washed off uh they're not calling for any rain this week that's that's unusual uh but anyway um kids stay up here by the building or either out by the Pavilion which you can't do this today uh but let's just not be in the the parking parking lot okay because we're worried about somebody getting getting hit and uh so today is not going to be a fun day for the kids I'm sorry I mean you know but either way we're just trying to get things U we are adding brother John and him y'all are going to have a full size pickle ball out here so see you know when you all this stuff comes about because we got a good group of kids here that's what it's all about so uh as adults we want y'all to have have a place to play a place to be able to do things and so that's right we got a playground coming uh so I mean we're going to we're trying to make some improvements uh and I don't know if y'all noticed ton not because I didn't and even though I mow the grass uh we come in here Friday and oh yeah that figures some young man had took a weed eater with a blade on it and y'all notice this ditch over here how many noticed it praise the okay okay so we got three four well I don't feel so bad then none of the rest of y'all noticed it neither I didn't notice it till it was brought to my attention uh brother Weston got a weedy with a blade on and cut that ditch back over here I mean it's that boy done some work U so y'all see him today tell him thank you because hey it sure looks a lot better and we're just going to try to take what the Lord's given us and blessed us with and go forward with it uh and not it it's easy sometime to let things go and go and go but we're going to try to do some improvement so that's all I got to say appreciate y'all uh appreciate everybody that come out uh I know everybody can't but the ones that did

and amen that uh he helped everything go smoothly amen and so we appreciate everything everybody does we still have quite a bit to do Amen to try to get ready amen with a couple of projects we want to try to get done amen and then next Sunday I've asked brother John if we couldn't have but maybe John and Alicia and have everybody uh come together that's going to help with the meetings amen so we'll have our Sunday after the service meeting next Sunday okay amen try to get everything organized because amen I've not been the most organized person in my life and I'm trying to do better amen so amen I like to things I like to see all of our ducks in a row don't you and and amen and so we appreciate everybody's help and let's all P together and and see what the Lord will to do amen amen and the meeting's coming up amen I can't think of any other announcements so we'll just go into the word we do want to have communion this morning so we won't go just too long but um amen so if you will stand with me and we'll try to express something I feel like the Lord's laid on my heart Amen to speak on this morning amen I think I finally got my wiring the way I like it amen and so um amen hopefully this will work out a little bit better amen so let's turn I guess this morning we'll maybe go to let's go to jerem no wait a minute not Jeremiah hold on a minute amen Matthew I believe it is let's go to Matthew Matthew will begin 19 Matthew 19 and I want to read one verse there and then we want to jump around just a little bit and then we'll see if we can with the help of the Lord tie it all together Matthew 19 and verse 8 says said and he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it wasn't so amen how many knows brother Brandon preached a message called it wasn't so from the beginning Amen on Genesis 1 Genesis 1 if you want to jump over there with me amen I hope and trust with what we are going to say this morning that it'll give us a new new appreciation or a further appreciation of what God has done in our generation amen not just in our generation but I trust that we can bring it down to every individual amen because you don't want it it's not all about somebody else getting something but it's what God did for you isn't that right as an individual each one of us as individuals amen and we uh no doubt but we'll take thousands of years Amen to really try to Fathom the greatness of God and the goodness of God amen and the grace of God because it's really all him amen I was thinking this morning amen uh you know earlier this morning just looking at everything and everything that your eyes look at everything you behold amen it's all something that God has created amen and sometimes we lose our appreciation for that the Simplicity of it but I think uh St first John talked about he says and without him there was not anything made that was made made amen so whenever you've got God on the inside here you realize where all the good things come from amen like he woke you up this morning like that song says and gave food on your tables when the bills came do there he was amen how many appreciates God this morning Amen in Genesis 1 and verse 9 it says and God said let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place he and let the dry land appear and it was so and God called the dry land Earth and he gathered together the waters and God saw the Seas and God saw that it was good and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and a herb yielding seed and a fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grath and a herb yielding seed after his kind and trees yielding fruit whose seed is in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good amen in the evening in the morning was the third day may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen I want to read a few quotes before I give you my title just to lay a little Foundation amen and this of course is out of the church age book Amen brother bandam talking about the Ephesian Church age and how that God helped him by the anointing and enabling of the Holy Spirit he seen unfolded he says a pattern that runs through centuries and right into this present last day amen and that is how to determine the messenger of each age amen and and so forth and the Church of each age amen and so he reads the scripture he says you know in Hebrews uh 13 and8 it says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Ecclesiastes 3:14 and 15 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him amen that which hath been is now and that which is to be has already been amen and God requireth that which is PED amen so that's kind of a that's kind of a hard saying and that which is to be has already been amen so my idon this morning with the help of the Lord is going back to the original amen amen in the future we go back to what has been amen how many know brother Bram clearly said he says we're heading heading back to the Garden need them as hard as we can but heading back there is a process isn't that right we have to go through a process because amen we find out that uh well let me just read a little more now notice here he says here it is an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at F at the first he will keep have to keep on doing it until it is done for the last time he says there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of a man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's ministry will be the example for all other ages what God did at the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages Amen brother BRS establishes one thing that God doesn't change whatever he does whatever he says is the original amen the original is what we want to dwell on with the little with the help of the Lord the original or and we all remember brother B preaching a message amen that he amen took about six hours to speak on and he was trying to express to the denominational systems he says you'll understand where I'm at and what I'm trying to say he you know how many know brother BR tried his best to try to get his point across of them folks and apparently he didn't because where are they at today is that right but at least he had he SED a seed amen now let me just say this the original spoken word is the Original Seed amen so we realize God's word is the original everything he does and when he had the book of Acts uh when he uh the first church that came out the first messenger of Paul that came out that was original amen that was the way that it was supposed to be amen and we have a pattern we have something because I don't know about you but I like something genuine I like something pedigree something original amen I don't like highbrid I don't like something mixed now how many knows you cannot mix the word of God and expect un hybrid uh all right let me think here an results you can't hyb something and then expect original results it's not going to be bring original socks you got to go back to the original amen if you're going to have original song Amen and results praise the Lord amen amen I love this don't you just love the word of God I'm telling you it'll put a smile on your face when you just just begin to think about it I smil this morning because we have the original again we have been restored to the original again we know a mule can never breed itself back can it no and there's only one thing because you and I as a brother Braham says you know because of Eve hting the word of God mixing Thou shalt not surely die she mixed it Ain that right now God had told them to multiply let every seed bring forth of its G kind and so forth he had told them to multiply is't that right but Eve amen she mixed it and threw us into death and now we are born hybrid now notice how he said that she was supposed to bring forth the Sons and Daughters of God without going back and pulling up all those quotes but brother bam says but God Amen continued his program anyway and you come anyway I like that because we're not some we're not some offshoot or not part of the program or not part of the plan isn't that right and we didn't come the way we were supposed to because of hybriding but we came anyway but we came in a hybrid condition not the way that we were supposed to or originally supposed to come amen but praise be to God Amen we came anyway how many glad to be here I'm glad to be here I'm glad to know who I am I think we touched on it a little bit perhaps in the last sermon talking about a a mule and a pedigree horse and just the wiing of him and so forth and how that pedigree horse knows who his mama was his grandpa was and where he come from and where he's going a mule doesn't know what he is why because well am I am I a mule or am I no actually it's a what was it a horse breed to a donkey ain't that right so he's half donkey half horse and he's like well I'm not sure which I am am I a horse or am I donkey it made me think of what brother bham said about the churches ain't that right man they don't know where they come from and what do they produce but they produce and I want to say this that be oh my here we go churches because of hybriding how many knows brother Brandon was real hard on the churches because they had hybd the word of God is't that right and It produced a bunch of a bunch of uh neurotics bunch of crazy people amen and look and we can actually blame the the flow and the uh the sin wave that came in is because that people heard the truth heard the original word and rejected the original word and accept the hybrid word instead that's why we've got people out there running around with green hair and purple hair and every other kind of hair and they've got tattoos everywhere all painted up why because the church World fell because they didn't hold the way they were supposed to do and now what what we got actually oh my brother B said you know my Ministry has gone nowhere it's they they you say my Ministry is De than any of them he says you're right all Roberts's Ministries over with pretty much Billy Grahams listen to it and the spoken word is the Original Seed he says but what has happened is amen the word has been swn denominational word has been sown and the word of God has been sown he says now you watch it's all going to produ a a crop every seed is going to bring forth of its own kind God is Not mocked whatever you sow you're going to reap oh man aren't you glad that every day you listen to the message of the hour amen you listen to amen the perfect Faith perfect love am mean you listen to the statute of a perfect man amen you're feeding on original word and it's do it's having an effect it does something for you amen they breed it with this they breed it with man's ideas and everything else and we know that Paul was the messenger he was the prophet of the hour and he had the word of the Lord he had the original word it comes how many know the original word comes to the prophets Paul had the original word and he says if anybody come and preach anything anything other than what I've preached is that right if he's an angel from heaven let him be a cursed and that's what prop Propet of God did is he came came to take us back to restore or breed us back to the original word amen let me just read a quote if I could my mission that I believe that God has called me this is out of spoken word is I have to say some personal things today because that's what I told you I do see tell the world my mission I believe to the Earth is what is to forerun the coming word see the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the Millennium has everything right there because he is the word then he goes to three John uh St John 35 and so forth and he says let's read the scripture Jesus answers and said unto him verily verily say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God we know that's what the prophet of God did what God did amen he used brother brandom to take us back to the original word back the word the way that Paul said it the way that Paul preached it and he started it with the birth is that right so the days of hybridizing and putting your name on a church book is that what Acts 2 says and they were all baptized amen joined the church put their name on the boat no did they all go into some kind of a a six Monon period where they were studying and amen and being taught what they got to do and what they know they were pricked in their hearts right straight back to acts 238 the only way to join a church or to join to Jesus Christ is to be baptized by one Spirit are we all baptized there's no other way if you want original result you've got to have original word if you want to be like the early Christians word and you've got to believe it the way that they believe that you got to let it come down in here the way they had it woo Glory all right now listen to what he said what kind of man God chose for the age and I'll say this the kind of Christians they were is what we want to be ain't that right we know now exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit how that at first or the original church amen the original church was founded in how God manifested himself in her and the word can't change or be changed because God's word can't change but he goes to uh certainly uh talking about and we probably won't go into it maybe we will let me finish this out thus what the church was at Pentecost cost was the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what scholar says God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing there it is if you'll notice that brother Randon whenever he started to even preach on on these Church ages it started at 53 ad to 170 so what happened with the first 52 years from what I understand in the message it wasn't the church age they were pure they were the pure Church the way we're supposed to be huh why do you think that even after lead AA God calls us out of that lead AA age go back to the way that they were before it ever even started rolling cuz the church age the first age fell a't that right we don't want to be in no Fallen condition they had been relaxed and they had been drifting and getting away from God oh my I don't know if I should let the cat out of the bag or not should I just go ahead and tell you you know when you're close to God and when you're right where you ought to be with God you are back to where you originally were supposed to be in fellowship with almighty God but the Devil comes and he is the interruptor of your walk with God oh maybe last week go had the Seal of the Lord I felt so good but I'll tell you what I spaid and I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I was a week ago then you're not the original the way you're supposed to be I me it takes because the Devil he's absolute Master at getting you to fall getting you away from the walk that you're supposed to have on the daily bases get you away from the original walk that you are walking with him and the Zeal that you have you ask yourself the question oh there was a time when I just had the love of God in my heart so much and then I wanted to pet every bird I just loved everybody everything was so peaceful and so wonderful in my heart but now today I'm not so much that way huh how many knows it's easy to drift got to be careful not to drift because that's what the church age did that's what they did but what they were at Pentecost is what you and I want to be amen at Pentecost acts the book of Acts amen all right listen and I I notice and what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right many preach on our rights and so forth but I want to take the next verse and speak On It originally very next word is her right originally she had the pure word of God how many believe that you and I got the pure word of God it's unadulterated it's proven it's Vindicated God himself backed it up how do you know cuz it's exactly what Paul said it's what the Bible says amen what she had originally what she had she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost amen original church was not organized by man it was led by the Holy Ghost oh man I'll tell you what I don't know what it is about human beings they like for the preacher they like for the pastor to have all of the spirit and just tell them what to do and what not to do say they're okay and everything else no it's not you have to have the Holy Ghost you've got to be led by the Holy Ghost personally if you're not you're not where you ought to be amen and the Bible talks about 12 different D diversities of gifts that should be in every local body how many believe that sometime maybe we'll get into it you'd be amazed that everybody that puts their little this that together and how well it works when everybody does what they're supposed to do amen we can't all stand up here and pro preach the gospel amen we can't all be a deacon trustee or the Sunday school teacher amen we all can't be privileged to be the ones that vacuums and cleans the house hello cuz they're honored how many believe they're as honored as anybody is that's exactly right but we've got different diversities and so forth we won't get into that but listen to what he says oh my listen he says now God can never change his ways his word won't never change his word will never come back to him void how many's glad for that when you place that word in your heart it will not come back void God is going to accomplish exactly what he said and I heard him say it in this in his spoken word he says if he said he's going to have a church without spot and without wrinkle that going to tell you right now somebody's going to manifest that if there's going to be a people amen that take a body change amen somebody's going to take a body change if somebody coming to the place of perfection that they're supposed to be woo amen he didn't call me to give my life and put my head to the chopping block amen or have to fight a lion or let it or whatever it might be but God called you and I for this age amen he called you to come to the way you're supposed to come to in this hour [Applause] Glory oh my aren't you glad there's something working in your heart that's God's word amen cuz how many knows every one of us is a seed there's no seed of God that will bring forth of its kind amen and if it's sewed in the right ground but brand him explained how to you know with the Baptist and Methodist and so forth he says there's no moisture there CU it takes the moisture of the Holy Spirit isn't that right to Quicken that word they might say they believe the Bible but the days of Miracles is passed and there's no such a holy no such a thing as the Holy Ghost you just Rob the moisture out of the church amen I'll tell you what you're never going to have not anything sitting in your pews but a dead sprigs they can't say Amen they can't say hallelujah they can't say Glory because there's nothing there that's glory god be about how many believes you need the moisture of the Holy Ghost you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're ever going to our Mount to Hill beans it's what quickens that word that's in there oh I'm so glad that we've got the word amen that's going to restore us back to the original amen edting that we're going to we've got a church on we've got a word that says look Eve disbelieve one word and we've got a word says if we could not disbelieve one word and expect to go back most pre she'll say well now God don't care if you cut your hair a little bit huh H God doesn't look at your outward appearance oh boy yeah yeah ah you sisters can wear a little makeup serpent is what that is straight serpent talk amen of God comes along he says man let every man's word be a line mind the truth Jesus comes along says him Heaven and Earth are pass away but my word shall never pass away he says anybody that adds one word to it but says one comma one jle you move one word you're taken out of the book your name gets erased it's taken out amen praise be to God I thank God God that we have once again not Luther Wesley or philosophers or some good writers but we've got thus saith the Lord if I've told you the truth and if God don't come back it up then you ain't got to believe it that's what he said amen and like I said before but Bram says talks about this and he says and go to Joshua 1 I believe it was he says as was with Moses so will I be with you I will never leave you nor forsake with you I will be with you always through your whole life that angel was with that prophet of God his whole life like I said Wednesday he never had to say well he didn't show up last night maybe he will tonight no God always showed up cuz he never laughed he was right there wo that don't do something for us who follow that I don't know what will we ain't got to back down we don't have to have one not one one little smidgen of doubt in my minds but what is the truth amen I don't care how many preachers say well he was wrong here he was wrong there just shut up already that's right because you'll never convince a Son of God not somebody that's born again cuz if you're born again you cannot sin you cannot disbelieve because your seed remains in in you how many believes that that seed in there it can't disbelieve God it'll tell the devil to shut up go fly a kite y'all know what that means amen you don't want to hear it that's right praise be to God what she was originally at Pentecost is our inalienable right amen listen he says now he says the true Messengers will be the ones that come to the closest of Paul who is free of all men sold out to God Amen ain't that right isin't that something how the prophet of God could preach here Paul a prisoner of Christ he would take a message and talk about how that Paul was a prisoner of Christ he couldn't go here he couldn't go there without the Holy Spirit leading him I mean that's our example you can't go here you can't do this that or the other unless the spirit leads you to do it amen oh my you have to work from the original he says as like beets alike the true church will always be the one that tries to follow the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul first messenger of the first church age it's that simple and it is that wonderful see Jesus came and he died that he might bring us or breed us back Hallelujah and only the blood can do that I don't care how sinful you are born in sin shap and iniquity I don't care how many bad of Sensations and everything if without the flesh am mean it's all man it's got lust and everything else in it amen it has to take the blood of Jesus Christ to wash us to clean us to restore us and give us actual a new birth that's why you got to be born again amen be born again let me just stop there and we'll pick it up again in a minute if we can remember but you know each and every one of us every person in here is different from each other I don't care if you get identical twins there will be they will have characteristic difference a't that right nobody's exactly alike is that right so each one of us is an original they just don't make him like irin anymore they don't make him like Martha they don't make him like Zoe you're the only one God Made You and threw it to pattern away there the only one like you take identical Twins and everything else nobody's fingerprints is the same a that amazing billions and billions billions of people and nobody's fingerprint is the same I mean is God is a god of variety I hate to disillusion you but brother Bram says man if you're he makes short people he makes big people he makes tall people he makes you know like the song says here comes the brid for it fat and white here comes the groom skinny has a broom hello I know people you I know people that are they're so skinny they're kind of they're skinny and I look at them like boy I wish I was like that and they wish they could gain weight and they can't gain weight why cuz they're made a certain way amen now don't I don't believe that we're going to be fat in heaven got one amen any others can I get some more why cuz that's something that we put on ain't that right what you are at 20 Amen in the Perfection of your body amen you're not going to be a glutton over there amen but you will be what God has made you about at the age of 20 years old ain't that right in your Prime that's what God took a picture of you as some of us will have this color hair and that color hair so all I can tell is get used to it a that right you're an original I like that be yourself how many these we need to be ourself brother bam talked much about you know people trying to impersonate other people you're not original anymore impersonate this preacher sometimes preachers impersonate other preachers and this that or the other huh but Tommy if I can just find myself find what I am and how I am I can't be like Brother Brad Brother Brad can't be like me hello we got our own ways we got our own and if we try to be like each other well we're going to make a big mess out of it that's right amen praise the Lord people aren't happy with the way that God made them ain't that right I was telling my wife I said she's Hollywood Holly with people that supposed to be models and everything else and they're still not happy with the theirselves and they'll put a artificial lip balm and everything else and cheek bombs and I told her man when they get done they look like some frog or something Ribbit ribit it's scary why simply because they weren't happy with how God made them how many believe you ought to be happy with what God made be happy with yourself amen then but it's important that every person finds out what God wants him to do and how you're supposed to do and the way you're supposed to act your personality not somebody else's personality didn't even brother Brown say you get a preacher out here whatever the pastor is you know amen a lot of times the people become like their Pastor not supposed to be that way unless it's by the power of the Holy Ghost now there's one thing that we have in common that is the Holy Ghost will make us all act the same amen do you know who I how I really found out who I originally was my originality how I found my originality y'all listening how do you find your original originality I guess there is such a word hopefully if not I don't really care that's just how I am sorry about that it is when I found him ain't that right CU my identity is in him when I saw Jesus that's who I wanted to be like why because I'll tell you what you know no matter how much you try not to but if you are born of your mom and your dad you're going to have characteristics of your mom and dad cuz you've got their genetics and I've got his genetics and when I found him and I say God I don't want to be like the old Thomas B that's hybrid I want to be like you God help me to be what you've made me to be you you made me to be your son help me to be a Son of God and I live like Paul I says the life now I that I live I live not of my own it's not my life it's his life now amen it's not my faith anymore it's not my love it's his life that's what I am that's who I am how many sons and daughters have we got here this morning not your own self but it's him you don't have to wonder and everything amen that's my annual coffee at Five Star this morning come up in line and there was somebody up in front of me look kind of like a girl pretty little pretty little earrings you know earrings there and I said wow the haircut looked like a girl's the way she'd cut her I says that's a girl I get ke that looks like a girl he turned mustache and a little bit of beard oops I got that wrong again oh my they make fun of us I'm not making necessarily I'm apologizing if I'm making fun but that's that's just nothing but the crowning of the devil ain't that right don't know who they are don't know which side of the fence as the prophet of God said Bel they belong on they need the grace of God they need salvation amen it'll help you amen it'll take all of that stuff away from you but what does it do preachers behind the pulpit let them kind of people be the preacher can you imagine letting homosexual be the preacher or women huh Pentecost how going look how Pentecost drifted Ain that right Paul said it's he forbid women to speak in church and so forth not to assert authority over man but go they' hybridized it now what did he got out there amen oh my bunch of harlots but Jesus came I like this Jesus came and he's the only one that can breed us back back to original again we're not born of Flesh anymore we're not born of sexual desire anymore now we come to church to be born how are we born young people how do you get born Peter said it this way 1 Peter 1 and verse 22 seeing that ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unframed love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again and not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible you don't know how much brother bam said in this seed that if you're ever going to be back to original you've got to take the word that the Bible has for you ain't that right Jesus said you know come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest he said I am the Water of Life that come down from If any man drink of this water he'll never thirst again the food that I have I am the bread that come down out of Heaven if anybody takes this amen he'll live forever so we see bringing into thought originally hello originally Adam and Eve didn't even have any clothes on did they didn't bother them none they didn't think nothing of it that's right but after sin came in then it was a different story originally Adam could say you know I don't like where that tree is come on over here be planted over here that right it would do it whatever he wanted he could just speak it and the Lord would come down in the cool of the evenings is that right and fellowship with him how did did you enjoy your day today oh Father it was just wonderful I'll tell you what Leo I really like Leo I'll tell you what he is my house pet Leo who Leo the Lion yeah oh big old furry coat isn't that right oh out down down shut that mouth you know maybe the breath wasn't bad then I don't know but that's right never have to have any fear there was no fear originally we didn't have any fear you didn't have to be scared of anything there was no condemnation in their heart no boy I did bad I I I'm scared of this that no there was no fear originally hello how many how many believes that a Christian we don't have to wait till get over there to go back to it no uh there no fear in love the Bible says if you got the genuine love of God and brother brandham Illustrated with the story he talked about the bull coming at him isin't that right he was no more scared of him than anything there was no fear when that love of God come down in his heart amen that's how I want to be how about you let's have the original love of God in our hearts let's have the original faith God never has to oh my think about this till the last one comes in he has he's never got to modify his faith for us well now let me improve my faith let me do this that or the other improve the Weaponry isin't that right no he never has to improve it because it's original every every aspect of it is original we miss it so many times there's even a song somebody wrote about the original Life The Original Seed amen that's what we need is everything original not mixed with anything else but there he was and how many believes that Jesus came to bring us back to that original to that original way that we were supposed to be amen oh my listen he says I'll give you a seed to the serpent the serpent had already defiled her he says but thy seed I'll give you a seed shall bruise his head he'll take that thing back again amen how many beli he's taking us back I just wish everybody could see that I've come to conquer and to correct what Eve did how many beli that was the prophet's Ministry also Jesus Christ through the prophet of God came to bring us back to that place amen the only thing the only thing that you and I lack or should lack was the change of this body because remember Jesus said after the blood and so forth he says was shed and so forth he said you know ask anything in my name and I will do it restored us back to Sons and Daughters of God again this is has a lot to do with realizing who you are amen how many believes we as a church as a group of people oh my pray for me pray for Brother Brad that we would preach the original so that we would have a an original product isn't that right we want to be like the original church that's a big responsibility on us ain't that right so Lord help me amen Lord help the ministry here to preach the original because if we don't have it how are you going to get it all right let me go I we won't go much further but a little bit more listen to what he says here that's right to correct what Eve did and the only way I can do it is through a woman that uh that believed the seed that'll believe the seed where that woman didn't believe it a woman that'll believe the word amen now we know that was Mary isn't that right Mary Let It Be unto me according to Thy word and not until this generation when that word came to its Perfection again now again we have have a church a people that says Lord let it be unto me according to your word and that right Lord let it be to me according to your word and that's how God's going to do it amen see I'm that Overcomer I'm the one that's come to give life that through my death and PID the penalty for what she did and through my life will be given to you and flow through and over you and you'll become sons of God and Daughters of God see as long as that seed is in there but you can't hybridize it with anything all of guns God's Sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and the spirit brings us back to that spoken word again Amen to be born of water and of spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again into that place where you should have been at the beginning back to original if you're born again you are back to being an original son and daughter of God how many thankful for that and then when you get to walking now let me just close with this when you get to Walking with God and so many so many illustrations I'd like maybe I'll do it this evening but when you're walking when you're driving in your car you're the only one in your car I do this a lot just praising him and say thank you Lord Jesus thank you for your goodness Lord I thank him for everything he's given me but most the biggest thing that I thank him for is the peace that he puts in your heart how many loves that peace that peace is it's just it it's passes understanding it's worth more than Trump's billion dollars how many know there's a lot of billionaires out there that are very very poor that are very very they're flat broke if they don't have God they're flat broke they're in a pitiful shape because they could give every last penny of it and it wouldn't buy one bit of peace or forgiveness ain't that right what you have is more valuable than any of that amen I thank God for that peace thank you Jesus amen we'll continue this on this evening amen I always deem it an honor a privilege to do what God has asked us to do Jesus said this do in remembrance of me as often as you take it because how many knows that it was because of that price that he paid on Calvary it's because of what he did on Calvary that we're even sitting here nothing could have ever come of anything if he wouldn't have been for what he did for us on Calvary for paying the price for us and we want to remember that amen as often as we take it amen amen amen so if you will stand with me for a minute with our heads bowed I want to have a prayer before I change the order to service what I was trying to say is if you're walking with God and the way that he originally intended for you to do if you have slipped from that originality I want I want to tell you something that I feel like the Holy Spirit impressed upon me to say and that is that if you're not where you should be in that state of originality your backslid not quite where you used to be the Lord Jesus wants to forgive you because if you re truly would repent this is the thought that he gave me if you truly repent because we have many shortcomings and failures years 490 times a day he would forgive you for it that's how forgiving he is that's how much he loves you so if you have raise your hand say God I'm not where I used to be I'm not as close as what I should be I'm not the way that I should be and father I ask you to forgive me this morning I want to walk in the way that I was originally intended for me to walk with you daily and it's nothing but the devil that gets us sometimes times and causes us to slip to falter to fail and to backslide so to speak even as the church did so many times but we raise our hands this Sunday and maybe it was just in the last few days whatever it might be it don't matter but the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour is checking up every hour we want to check up every week we want to check up every day every hour of the day say God don't let me slip let me walk in that walk and don't let the devil cause anything to come into my life that would cause a disfellowship between me and you but I want to be that original son and daughter walking with you you see these hands Lord they didn't raise it to me they raised it to you Lord seeing they're guilty but they surrender and they ask forgiveness Lord before we take this communion we want to make sure everything's right so that our lives are worthy of the gospel and are worthy of taking this so that we don't eat or drink damnation to ourselves Lord if there's any that's not worthy and can't take it I pray in the name of Jesus before the next communion service Lord that you would help them overcome and get to the place that they can Lord but Lord we they can do it right now if they'll just repent God we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk like original Sons and Daughters were meant to be in Jesus name amen and amen you believe believe he forgives you he believes he loves you amen turn your Bibles we'll just turn to change the order to service at this time
