[47:26] around. But thank Jesus, he seen fit to
[47:29] keep his hand up on me and pull me
[47:32] through all this one more time. And I
[47:34] have been so sick. And the prayers of
[47:37] y'all has helped bring me through this.
[47:40] They have no ID, the sickness. And I
[47:44] just think about Sister Beller so much.
[47:47] I'm so thankful to God she didn't have
[47:49] to go through as much as some people has
[47:53] to do. I'm so thankful for that that
[47:56] she's doing as good as she is. And God
[47:58] is a healer. And I know that's what has
[48:01] brought me through all this. I couldn't
[48:03] eat. I got to where I just was about 100
[48:07] pound or less. I look like a skeleton
[48:09] now with skin pulled over me. God gone.
[48:12] I just got to eating over the weekend.
[48:15] My food's getting to taste a little bit
[48:17] better. I've been eating like a little
[48:19] pig and it just really felt so good. I
[48:23] said, "Well,
[48:25] somebody ate like I was starved." You
[48:28] know, brother Ber, I was starved because
[48:30] I hadn't been able to eat for about nine
[48:32] months. And the food is good. I mean, it
[48:36] had to be God and y'all's prayers has
[48:39] brought through this. And I thank God
[48:41] for that. There's so much more I could
[48:43] tell that I have went through and got
[48:46] through. But God knows, and y'all know
[48:48] most of it, too. I just praise God for
[48:51] it. Hallelujah. He's so merciful to me.
[48:54] He has blessed me abundantly. I want to
[48:57] give him praise for it. Hallelujah. And
[48:59] y'all keep me in your prayers and that
[49:02] I'll continue to grow in him, that I'll
[49:05] do God's will and stay in his will.
[49:08] That's my desire. I I owe him
[49:10] everything. I will my whole life.
[49:14] Amen. That's good. Thank you, Sister P.
[49:19] Everybody's praying for you. All right.
[49:21] Okay. Bless y'all and y'all have a good
[49:23] meeting. My mom got I'm tuned in to you.
[49:27] All right. God bless you now. Love
[49:29] y'all. God bless you all. All right.
[49:32] Byebye.
[49:35] All right. Well, that's a good way to
[49:36] start it, isn't it? Amen. Amen. Walls.
[49:41] Thank you, Jesus.
[49:43] Praise the Lord.
[49:45] Hallelujah. Amen. God is so good. Amen.
[49:50] I can't I I'll be honest with you. I
[49:52] can't imagine, you know, what she's went
[49:54] through. Amen. That starving to death
[49:57] and having taken that chemo and how sick
[49:59] she was and and hanging in there, just
[50:02] keeping the faith, you know, it' have
[50:04] probably been a lot easier just to go or
[50:06] give up, but she didn't. And she've had
[50:08] the faith and we believe with her,
[50:11] prayed with her. So, we're just so
[50:13] thankful to God that she's still here
[50:14] with us. And hopefully one of these days
[50:16] when she comes walking in here, Amen,
[50:18] we'll rejoice and stomp on the devil a
[50:20] little more. Ain't that right? Amen.
[50:23] Praise the Lord. Amen. All right. Who's
[50:25] who who else is going to Tommy? You
[50:27] going to give a testimony to warm it up
[50:28] or what? No. All right, brother Devin.
[50:34] All right. He can come up here if he
[50:36] wants to.
[50:40] All right.
[50:42] God bless you,
[50:46] man. Y'all look tired.
[50:51] make you all do some jumping jacks
[50:52] quick. Um, I'm going to read uh
[50:56] Revelations 12 11 to get started. Um,
[51:00] and that says, "And they overcame him by
[51:02] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[51:04] their testimony, and they love not their
[51:06] lives unto the death."
[51:08] Um, I just want to say this. Uh, every
[51:12] one of y'all have a story.
[51:15] every one of you guys have have
[51:17] witnessed the the blood of Jesus
[51:20] covering you. So, you have a story and
[51:23] it matters. And so, um I just say that
[51:26] as an encouragement. Uh she's she's uh
[51:30] she hates getting in front of people.
[51:32] So, um but it's okay. Uh with God's
[51:36] help, we're going to get through it. Um,
[51:39] I guess I'm going to I'll start out by
[51:41] saying in my test in our testimony when
[51:45] we talk about if we talk about family or
[51:47] something like that, we don't mean
[51:48] anything by that. It's just part of our
[51:50] testimony. It's part of what God um it's
[51:53] part of what God brought us through. So,
[51:56] um, and also Tommy's a big part of it.
[51:59] So, I just want to bless you, Tommy, in
[52:01] that uh we met, me and Tommy met in
[52:05] Florida on a prison crusade. Um, and so
[52:09] we would get together once a year in
[52:11] Florida. There was six men's prisons,
[52:14] one women's prison, and me and her would
[52:17] go into the prisons for about a week or
[52:19] half a week and witness to the inmates.
[52:22] Um, and so that's where I would have met
[52:24] Tommy. That's kind of where this journey
[52:26] all started. And uh we're pretty new in
[52:28] this journey. Uh we've only been here
[52:31] for about a month, a little over a
[52:33] month. Um and so it's crazy what the
[52:36] Lord has done in the past year and a
[52:37] half, two years. And we just want to
[52:39] give give him the glory for it. Um it's
[52:42] not it's not our testimony, it's God's
[52:44] testimony.
[52:49] So So tonight, we just want to we just
[52:51] want to lift up the name of the Lord uh
[52:53] in our testimony. And so, um, like I
[52:56] said, I met Tommy down there in Florida
[52:58] and we, uh, we're going through this
[53:02] whole week of of, uh, of going into
[53:05] prisons and everything. And we get
[53:07] together at uh, at the main hub there.
[53:09] There was about 150 volunteers and we
[53:11] get together and have worship nights and
[53:13] stuff like that. And I seen him across
[53:15] the way. And I never I never even
[53:18] thought about talking to him. You don't
[53:19] even get close to talking to everybody.
[53:21] and and uh we're going through and we're
[53:24] going through the week and Saturday came
[53:25] around. We're getting ready to go into
[53:26] prison and uh all of a sudden our group
[53:30] leader is like, "Hey, we got another
[53:31] group coming with us because their
[53:33] prison on the last day I think Tommy was
[53:36] cutting out Sunday morning." And so uh
[53:38] he it was the last day that he was going
[53:40] to be there. And so we uh we're we're
[53:42] like, "All right, so this group's coming
[53:44] in with us." And uh we get we get into
[53:47] uh get into the prison and we're going
[53:49] around in max lockdown everything. Never
[53:51] talked to him. And finally around noon
[53:53] we'd have a worship team would come in
[53:55] and an evangelist and we'd have a chapel
[53:57] service and uh and brother Tommy was
[54:00] there
[54:02] and uh uh Tommy will say it. He said
[54:05] that the Lord told him that his story is
[54:06] his message. And that goes for every one
[54:08] of us. Our story is our message. And so,
[54:11] uh, we're just doing our chapel service
[54:14] and the worship, we're in there just
[54:17] doing our thing. We're and the worship
[54:19] team is singing. Uh, they start singing,
[54:21] "I speak Jesus." And I'm never going to
[54:23] forget it because I got the prickleys
[54:25] real bad cuz Tommy stands up in his seat
[54:28] right down here in the front and he
[54:29] starts yelling Jesus.
[54:32] And I mean, I got the prickleys. I'm
[54:34] like, "What is going on?" And uh, the
[54:36] inmates are thinking the same thing. I
[54:38] mean, they're standing up. They're head
[54:39] headed to the altar. I'm like, I ain't
[54:42] never heard I ain't never seen this
[54:43] before. So, I'm like, I got to talk to
[54:44] this dude afterward. And so, we were
[54:47] waiting after the inmates got out and
[54:49] going back to their cells. We're
[54:50] waiting. I'm like, I'm talking with
[54:51] Tommy. I'm like,
[54:54] Tommy says, the first thing I ever told
[54:55] him was, uh, you can raise hands in your
[54:58] church, can't you?
[55:01] So, praise the Lord. But he said, yes,
[55:03] sir. Yes, sir. And, uh, from there, he
[55:05] started sharing his story. And uh we
[55:08] were I would say me me and her both we
[55:11] were really searching at that time,
[55:13] searching for something more. Um in past
[55:16] prison crusades, we would come come home
[55:19] all fired up for the Lord and and we'd
[55:21] go home and I I'll never forget it, but
[55:24] there was a brother in the church up
[55:26] there and he said, "Oh, just give it a
[55:29] little bit. You'll come off the high.
[55:31] You'll come off the spiritual high." And
[55:33] I I thought to myself, I'm like, man,
[55:36] you guys don't even I mean, I can't even
[55:38] get none of you guys to even to go on
[55:40] these things. And I'm out here trying to
[55:41] do what the Lord's called us to do. The
[55:43] Lord called us to go into to prisons and
[55:46] witness and and compel them to come. And
[55:48] so, that's what the Lord called us to.
[55:50] And so, from there, I was like, man,
[55:52] there's got to be something more to the
[55:54] Christian life, something that's
[55:56] powerful. We read in Acts and we read
[55:58] through the through the New Testament
[55:59] and Jesus all the way through it and
[56:01] there's nothing but power and
[56:02] demonstration of the spirits. And so
[56:04] we're like there's got to be something
[56:06] more. And so uh Tommy started uh I he he
[56:10] we exchanged numbers and I'm like nah
[56:12] there ain't no way. This is just going
[56:13] to be like everything else. We're going
[56:15] to exchange numbers. I'm never going to
[56:17] talk to the dude in my life. And uh well
[56:21] that was I guess that wasn't the way
[56:23] that it was cuz uh he started texting me
[56:26] and uh I'm going to be I'm going to be
[56:28] open cuz there was a time that I got
[56:31] annoyed because this dude kept texting
[56:33] me. He wouldn't let me alone.
[56:37] He start he started texting me all day
[56:40] every day late in the night and I'm like
[56:42] what is this? What is going on? She's
[56:45] like what what is this? And uh and he
[56:48] kept saying he kept saying, "Uh, dude,
[56:51] you got to come visit. You got to come
[56:52] visit. You got to come see church." And
[56:54] uh and so we're like, "All right, well."
[56:58] So we came the first time and uh we sat
[57:00] down right here in the second pew. And
[57:02] uh this service was all good and cool
[57:05] and everything. We're like, "This is
[57:06] awesome." And then Brother Ber got up to
[57:08] preach and I'll never forget what he
[57:10] preached that day either. He started
[57:11] talking about stagnant waters in the
[57:13] church. And it was exactly what we were
[57:15] dealing with back home. And so we were
[57:18] like, "Whoa, this is awesome." You know,
[57:19] the Lord's just being in it, working in
[57:21] it, and our conversations. And and uh so
[57:24] it was amazing. And so that got us
[57:26] thinking and uh was thinking about it.
[57:28] Tommy started laying on uh baptism part
[57:32] uh in Acts 2:38. And uh uh I think
[57:36] brother Ron said it, you don't really
[57:37] need a I might be paraphrasing here, but
[57:40] you don't need a conviction to to to
[57:42] know what to do with that verse. So I'm
[57:44] like, well, the Bible says we need to be
[57:46] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[57:48] So we came second time we came, we were
[57:50] uh we got rebaptized in the name of
[57:52] Jesus. So uh praise the Lord for that.
[57:55] And uh
[58:01] um so we uh we started we started coming
[58:05] and we started uh just uh just streaming
[58:09] and I started uh you know subscribing to
[58:12] different channels from and YouTube and
[58:15] and uh man it was just it was just good.
[58:19] I mean I mean we couldn't I mean it was
[58:20] just like the simplicity of it and we
[58:22] were just it was just we were feeding on
[58:24] it and like Tommy said it's a it's
[58:26] stakes. It ain't on milk no more it's
[58:29] stakes. Uh and so from there on we just
[58:33] kind of kept it kept multiplying and uh
[58:36] we got rebaptized and then
[58:40] uh this was we didn't tell our family.
[58:43] We didn't tell anybody about this at
[58:45] all. And so, uh,
[58:49] we somehow I was like, we're just going
[58:51] to stay quiet about it because obviously
[58:53] we would have we would have came out of
[58:54] the Menanite culture. And, uh, so the
[58:58] fabric hair covering is a big thing for
[59:01] the in the Menanites. And, uh, we
[59:04] believe that the hair was given to her
[59:07] for a covering. And so, we're not going
[59:09] to get into all that, but my family and
[59:12] church friends and stuff would have been
[59:15] strongly against that. um you're basic I
[59:18] mean it's salvation based so that
[59:20] hinders your eternity to them and so
[59:25] we uh I said we're just going to be
[59:27] quiet about it for a while and uh the
[59:29] Lord said nope
[59:34] he said no no uh the Lord just took over
[59:37] conversations with family and just uh
[59:40] just
[59:42] got to that point right away and so you
[59:44] I was like Well, here we go. His word
[59:47] says what it says, so we're just going
[59:49] to go with it. And uh my family
[59:52] obviously really strongly disagreed with
[59:54] that. And hence they started praying
[59:57] over me. And and uh they wanted to, you
[1:00:01] know, this is fine, you know. I mean, I
[1:00:04] don't I don't care. I need I need
[1:00:05] prayers, too. And uh and a couple days
[1:00:09] later, they asked us to come over
[1:00:11] because they wanted to further discuss
[1:00:13] it. And so we went over and it was fine.
[1:00:15] We I mean we had a good discussion and
[1:00:19] and uh
[1:00:21] then it got to a point where you know we
[1:00:24] were just going in circles and so I just
[1:00:26] I was like well we're not getting
[1:00:28] anywhere here. So, let's go let's go to
[1:00:32] scripture
[1:00:33] to uh I I think it's Mark where it says
[1:00:37] where Jesus commissioned us to go out
[1:00:39] and to pray over the sick in the name of
[1:00:41] Jesus they will recover. Cast out demons
[1:00:43] in my name. Um if any if you drink any
[1:00:47] deadly poison, it won't harm you. And so
[1:00:50] I said, "What about this?" It says,
[1:00:52] "Those that believe, this is what's
[1:00:53] going to follow them. This is going to
[1:00:55] be attributes of them. This is
[1:00:56] demonstrating the power of the Holy
[1:00:58] Ghost. All right. So then, uh, they
[1:01:01] said, "Well, we did. We did cast out a
[1:01:04] demon just a while ago." I was like,
[1:01:06] "Okay, sweet. Let's hear about it." And
[1:01:09] they said, "Well,
[1:01:11] uh, we uh we we prayed over you the
[1:01:14] other day, but obviously it didn't work.
[1:01:21] I told Tommy that, and Tommy says, "No,
[1:01:23] you can't cast out the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:28] So that was that uh that that really
[1:01:31] played mentally with me just not just
[1:01:34] seeing hearing that from family, people
[1:01:37] you love and people you thought would
[1:01:39] wouldn't ever do that. But um it's okay
[1:01:43] because the Lord was in it. God works
[1:01:45] everything uh out for good. So um life
[1:01:49] continued and uh we're going to just
[1:01:51] kind of me and her going to trade off
[1:01:53] here. So, I'm going to let her speak
[1:01:55] here in a little bit, but uh this was
[1:01:57] coming down to the fall of last year, I
[1:02:00] believe it was. And Tommy said, Tommy
[1:02:03] and said, "Hey, you should come to
[1:02:05] Louisiana special meetings." And I'm
[1:02:08] like, "Dude, I'm tiptop in Missouri.
[1:02:10] This is a drive." And uh I was like,
[1:02:13] "Well, whatever. We're young. What do we
[1:02:15] got to lose?" I text her. I said, "Hey,
[1:02:17] you want to go to Louisiana?" She said,
[1:02:18] "Sure." So, we uh we packed up at like I
[1:02:22] look like we left at 3:00 or 4 in the
[1:02:23] morning on Friday morning to go to
[1:02:25] Louisiana. It was 16 hours one way and
[1:02:27] we had to we we beat foot all the way
[1:02:30] down there and got to our room. And I
[1:02:33] mean, we threw our luggage in the room
[1:02:34] and back out the door again to go to the
[1:02:36] special meetings. And uh at this point,
[1:02:39] I haven't we hadn't really had any
[1:02:41] experiences
[1:02:42] uh with the Lord really. I mean, not
[1:02:44] supernatural anyway. And so we uh we're
[1:02:47] there for the Friday night special
[1:02:49] meetings and uh we're sitting we're
[1:02:52] sitting back pretty far probably center
[1:02:55] I guess and uh I think it was brother
[1:02:58] Michael Ray preaching that service and
[1:03:00] uh he had a very powerful service and
[1:03:02] we're we're sitting there and uh he got
[1:03:06] done done preaching and and brother
[1:03:08] Timothy Purr got up and started speaking
[1:03:10] a little bit and the atmosphere in that
[1:03:13] building changed. I've never been in an
[1:03:15] I had never been in an atmosphere like
[1:03:16] it. And it was like the winds of
[1:03:18] Pentecost. I mean it rippled from the
[1:03:20] front of the church all the way to the
[1:03:21] back. And I mean you it hit you in the
[1:03:23] chest so hard. It was like what what is
[1:03:26] this? And it got so I mean it got so
[1:03:28] intense. And we're sitting there and I
[1:03:30] never heard it. And there's a lady right
[1:03:31] over here right next to us. She starts
[1:03:33] speaking in tongues. And I'm like what?
[1:03:36] I've never I mean I'm Menanite boy. I
[1:03:39] just come out of the Menanite church.
[1:03:41] This is this is blows my mind. And so uh
[1:03:45] but that was that was the first time
[1:03:47] that I ever been in a presence like
[1:03:49] that. And that was a very standing
[1:03:51] factor. The rock that it was a rock of
[1:03:54] foundation that we stood on for a long
[1:03:57] time after that because of that
[1:03:58] experience. And when people would, you
[1:04:00] know, try to say, "Hey, you need to
[1:04:02] watch what you're doing. and you watch,
[1:04:04] you know, and uh it start get you'd
[1:04:06] start thinking about that a little bit
[1:04:08] like maybe uh and then you go back and
[1:04:11] you'd relive that moment in Louisiana
[1:04:14] said no this right here we go back to
[1:04:16] here where we had this experience and so
[1:04:19] that was that was where we stood a lot
[1:04:22] of and so
[1:04:24] uh and then the next night was uh insane
[1:04:28] and that's part of her story. So, we're
[1:04:31] going to just kind of switch back and
[1:04:32] forth here and then hopefully everything
[1:04:35] makes sense.
[1:04:44] Okay. So, as you all know, I'm not very
[1:04:47] um natural at public speaking, but so if
[1:04:49] I can do it, anybody else can do it.
[1:04:55] But I just decided that what God has
[1:04:57] done for me is worth putting myself out
[1:05:00] there. Um it don't matter what people
[1:05:02] think. Um what matters is what God has
[1:05:04] done for me. And um I just want to
[1:05:07] testify of the heart of God of who he is
[1:05:09] and what he's done in my life because
[1:05:10] it's just incredible.
[1:05:12] So as Devin was saying
[1:05:15] um the Louisiana revival meetings. So
[1:05:19] Friday night was incredible and I was
[1:05:20] pretty shell shocked too because we were
[1:05:23] never in something like that. And um we
[1:05:26] didn't even know the message existed
[1:05:29] until we met Tommy. So a little over a
[1:05:32] year ago, we didn't even know anything
[1:05:33] like this was out there. And like Devin
[1:05:37] said, we just knew there was something
[1:05:38] else, something more to the Christian
[1:05:39] life. And we were looking for it. And
[1:05:40] then God just dropped Tommy in right
[1:05:42] there at the right m right right moment.
[1:05:44] And it was just like, wow.
[1:05:46] So anyways, um ever since um we started
[1:05:50] learning about the message, you know,
[1:05:52] just uh the baptism of Jesus and all
[1:05:53] that stuff, just the power of the Holy
[1:05:55] Ghost, um you know, I got that desire
[1:05:57] that I want to experience that. And
[1:06:00] Friday evening, like I said, it was
[1:06:01] awesome. But I I didn't feel it like I
[1:06:03] could tell I wasn't feeling it like the
[1:06:05] rest of the people were around me. And I
[1:06:07] was like, I really wanted that. And um
[1:06:11] so I guess I just told Devon Friday
[1:06:13] night like it just felt like I was on
[1:06:15] the outside looking in to all these
[1:06:17] other people. The Holy Spirit was just
[1:06:19] raining down on them, but it just I just
[1:06:20] couldn't quite, you know, feel that
[1:06:22] power. So Saturday evening came around
[1:06:24] and I was really tired um during the
[1:06:27] service and
[1:06:29] um I was just really fighting against
[1:06:32] tiredness and feeling almost lukewarm.
[1:06:35] Um, I was eager to see what God would
[1:06:38] do, but I was just really fighting
[1:06:39] against that. And I kept praying
[1:06:41] throughout the service, you know, God,
[1:06:42] give me my portion, just pour out on top
[1:06:45] of me and just become real to me. And
[1:06:48] um, and he did.
[1:06:52] So
[1:06:53] after the services, there was a prayer
[1:06:55] line and me and Deon have never seen
[1:06:57] anything like a prayer line either. So
[1:06:58] that was new to us, too. So, we went
[1:07:00] through this prayer line and um I just
[1:07:04] remember distinctly, you know,
[1:07:05] everybody's talking, but I just remember
[1:07:07] hearing these words, just receive it.
[1:07:10] Just accept it, the Holy Spirit. And so,
[1:07:14] we went through the prayer line and it
[1:07:16] was cool and it was, you know, got a
[1:07:18] little bit emotional. Then we went
[1:07:19] outside for a little bit and Deon's
[1:07:21] like, "Did you know you got anointed?"
[1:07:23] I'm like, "What? I didn't even realize
[1:07:25] that." Apparently, one of the preachers
[1:07:27] had um put oil on my forehead and I was
[1:07:30] like, "Oh." And that just really kind of
[1:07:32] started moving things inside of me. Then
[1:07:34] we went back inside and the prayer line
[1:07:36] was still going and we started
[1:07:38] worshiping the Lord and then that song
[1:07:40] um the song Jesus came on. Um what's it?
[1:07:45] I speak Jesus. Yeah, that one came on
[1:07:48] and we were just worshiping and then
[1:07:50] Tommy and some of them were yelling out
[1:07:52] the name of Jesus and I just felt like
[1:07:53] doing the same thing and I kept yelling
[1:07:54] out the name Jesus and suddenly it came
[1:07:58] the Holy Spirit in all its power just
[1:08:00] came down on me
[1:08:04] and it was so incredible like I it was
[1:08:08] almost like I just I lost you know where
[1:08:12] I was at and I just like the Holy Spirit
[1:08:15] was just, you know, yelling out these
[1:08:17] words like hallelujah. And it's like I
[1:08:19] wasn't saying these things. That was
[1:08:21] just I've never experienced anything
[1:08:22] like that before. And it was like the
[1:08:24] only way I could explain it is that
[1:08:25] these words were erupting out of my soul
[1:08:26] and the Holy Spirit was just speaking
[1:08:28] these words because I was just listening
[1:08:30] to myself say them. And it was so
[1:08:32] incredible. And it was just wow. And
[1:08:35] um
[1:08:37] [Applause]
[1:08:40] so I'm just really really thankful for
[1:08:43] that. Um God really did answer my
[1:08:45] prayer. He became real to me that night.
[1:08:47] Um, just with his power and everything.
[1:08:49] So, praise the Lord for that. And after
[1:08:52] that, there was, you know, worship and I
[1:08:54] just couldn't stay in my spot. I just
[1:08:55] had to go down in the aisles and do a
[1:08:58] little bit of dancing. So, that was fun.
[1:09:00] And then that whole evening was just
[1:09:02] like I just felt um drunk in the spirit
[1:09:05] pretty much. And I was like, "So, this
[1:09:07] is how it is."
[1:09:10] So, that was incredible. And I just want
[1:09:11] to praise the Lord for that. Um,
[1:09:16] let's see.
[1:09:18] So, also last year, the devil, ever
[1:09:21] since we started learning about the
[1:09:23] message, the devil just really took it
[1:09:25] upon himself to attack me with various
[1:09:27] things.
[1:09:29] Um, and one of those things I'd been
[1:09:31] dealing with for a few years, but we
[1:09:33] just kind of discovered it last summer.
[1:09:36] And it's called endometriosis. Um it's
[1:09:41] not very common thing but um it's a
[1:09:43] thing in women um I was diagnosed with
[1:09:48] endo and pretty much what it is
[1:09:51] it is like scar tissue inside the
[1:09:54] uterus. It can grow outside the uterus.
[1:09:57] Um it'll it'll give you extreme
[1:10:00] abdominal stomach and lower back pain.
[1:10:03] Absolutely horrible pain. Um and it'll
[1:10:07] cause a lot of reproductive issues. Um,
[1:10:10] so I've been dealing with that for
[1:10:12] actually a few years and then like I
[1:10:15] said last year we I was actually
[1:10:17] diagnosed with it and so
[1:10:20] pretty much for a doctor the way that
[1:10:22] they see it is you got to go to surgery
[1:10:24] to get it removed.
[1:10:26] And
[1:10:28] so we made some plans and I had some
[1:10:29] other friends that had dealt with the
[1:10:31] same thing and they did surgery out in
[1:10:32] Colorado. So, we scheduled ski surgery
[1:10:35] out in Colorado and then um through this
[1:10:39] whole thing, Tommy was just saying, you
[1:10:41] know, Jesus already paid it on the cross
[1:10:43] and you know, I was still new to the
[1:10:45] whole healing concept. So, I was like
[1:10:47] kind of scared kind of like what do I
[1:10:48] do? Um so
[1:10:52] anyways, and then we just started
[1:10:54] praying about it like, "Okay, God, what
[1:10:56] do you want want us to do? Do you want
[1:10:58] us to go to the surgery? Do you just
[1:11:00] want me to just wing it? Just step out
[1:11:03] in faith and just like believe, you
[1:11:05] know, I'm healed without the surgery.
[1:11:06] You know, that looked both of those
[1:11:08] looked like a big mountain to me, a big
[1:11:11] journey, whether it was surgery or
[1:11:12] whether it was believing on my healing
[1:11:14] because at the time I felt like it was
[1:11:16] up to me to have enough of faith. And it
[1:11:18] and then eventually I learned, you know,
[1:11:20] it's God that puts the faith there. So
[1:11:24] that was pretty scary. But as time went
[1:11:26] on, I got these little signs here and
[1:11:28] there about the healing touch of Jesus.
[1:11:31] And I was like, "Okay, I think I know
[1:11:33] what needs to be done." And then we
[1:11:36] really knew what needed to be done
[1:11:37] because the financial ends weren't um
[1:11:39] meeting. The insurance wasn't working
[1:11:42] well with us. So just some problems came
[1:11:47] up with that. So we're like, "Okay,
[1:11:48] looks like we're not doing the surgery."
[1:11:51] And then um I would say I was
[1:11:58] I was kind of like I didn't know how to
[1:12:00] feel about it. I was just like, "Okay,
[1:12:01] I'm just going to trust God, you know,
[1:12:03] through the whole process." And then um
[1:12:06] over the next few months, I was I would
[1:12:08] get kind of discouraged because I'm
[1:12:09] like, "Okay, when is this healing going
[1:12:11] to take place?" You know, is it going to
[1:12:12] be many many months and then I'm have to
[1:12:13] go through all this endless pain and
[1:12:15] everything? But finally, a few months
[1:12:17] later, the devil came in and he pounded
[1:12:22] me with some of the worst pain I've ever
[1:12:23] felt in my entire life. Um, I'd already
[1:12:25] felt it before from that specific thing,
[1:12:28] but he really just hit me really hard.
[1:12:32] Um, extreme pain and like it was just
[1:12:37] unbearable and a lot of doubts.
[1:12:41] like you know you he would be trying to
[1:12:43] tell me you know you wouldn't you
[1:12:45] wouldn't um be feeling this pain if you
[1:12:47] were healed and all that stuff and I was
[1:12:50] by myself Devon was at work so I picked
[1:12:52] up one of brother Brandham's uh the
[1:12:55] books of his quotes um healing thoughts
[1:12:58] or something like that started reading
[1:13:00] through that and I was like okay so
[1:13:05] through through the pain and everything
[1:13:06] I started claiming my healing out loud I
[1:13:09] was like okay By his stripes, I'm
[1:13:11] healed. I believe it. It's God's word.
[1:13:13] God's word is above all truth. Even the
[1:13:15] truth of what my body is trying to tell
[1:13:16] me.
[1:13:18] I kept saying that and saying it and
[1:13:20] saying it until I felt like I couldn't
[1:13:21] talk anymore. And then I remembered what
[1:13:24] Tommy said about when he feels like he's
[1:13:26] not healed or that I was trying to get
[1:13:28] to him, he goes and, you know, works out
[1:13:29] and defies the pain. So I'm like, okay,
[1:13:32] what can I do to defy the pain? One of
[1:13:35] the worst things you want to do when
[1:13:37] you're feeling that is to get up and
[1:13:39] walk around and all that jazz. So, I
[1:13:42] stood up and
[1:13:44] um started walking around slowly just in
[1:13:47] my living room by myself just um
[1:13:50] claiming my healing. The more I paced
[1:13:54] and I just kept my words kept getting
[1:13:56] louder. I kept feeling stronger, more
[1:13:58] renewed, and just like, you know, booing
[1:14:02] the devil and all that stuff. And just
[1:14:05] in a couple seconds, that extreme pain
[1:14:07] was nothing.
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:17] And the joy of the Lord just filled me
[1:14:19] and overwhelmed me. And I just started
[1:14:21] jumping and praising and shouting and
[1:14:22] laughing and crying at the same time.
[1:14:25] And that was just incredible. And then a
[1:14:29] couple minutes later, the devil came
[1:14:31] back for round two.
[1:14:35] He hit me again with that awful, awful
[1:14:37] pain. And by then, I was like physically
[1:14:39] and mentally so worn out. And he the
[1:14:41] doubts were the doubts and fears came in
[1:14:43] almost stronger the second time. I was
[1:14:45] like, "Okay, seriously." So I was like,
[1:14:48] "I need help. I need prayer." I told
[1:14:50] Deon, "I need prayer." He um yeah, he'd
[1:14:52] pray for me and I just texted him that
[1:14:54] and he encouraged me to put it on the
[1:14:55] women's group chat. And so I did that,
[1:14:57] the ladies group chat in here. So I knew
[1:15:00] I had other people helping me fight
[1:15:02] these demons. Um and I did the same
[1:15:05] thing as I did the last time, just
[1:15:06] claiming my healing, just telling the
[1:15:08] devil to get out of here. And it
[1:15:10] happened again. The pain went away again
[1:15:14] in just in just a couple seconds. Like
[1:15:16] that's just supernatural. Normally the
[1:15:18] pain it would take a long time to just
[1:15:20] simmer out but it was just gone like the
[1:15:23] devil himself just left and I was once
[1:15:24] again filled with the joy of the Lord.
[1:15:26] And I will look back then I'm like I
[1:15:29] know I am healed. I am healed. Yeah.
[1:15:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:49] So when we uh she experienced her
[1:15:53] healing, praise God for that. Um so then
[1:15:57] at that point in our journey, we knew
[1:16:00] what we had to do. Uh we felt that call
[1:16:02] from the Lord. So uh we need to move.
[1:16:06] And uh I was stressing about the
[1:16:09] financial end of it, getting a job.
[1:16:11] Tommy's kept telling me, "I can work
[1:16:13] you. I can work you and I'm sure my
[1:16:15] friends can work you. It'll be all
[1:16:16] right. You know, we can do this." And uh
[1:16:19] and but I I had my own doubts. And I was
[1:16:22] like, "I don't know." And uh and brother
[1:16:26] Tom, you had an apartment at that time
[1:16:28] and we came down and we stayed there and
[1:16:31] uh and I I don't mean any offense to
[1:16:34] your apartment, but she said, "Nope." I
[1:16:37] said, "We can make it work. I mean,
[1:16:39] it'll be fine. we can make it work. She
[1:16:42] said nope.
[1:16:45] It's okay.
[1:16:48] She says not enough space.
[1:16:51] So at that then we needed a house and
[1:16:53] I'm like I don't know. We're just uh I
[1:16:56] don't know. I got hit obviously when
[1:16:58] when the when the Lord works like that.
[1:17:01] The devil does too. And uh I got a
[1:17:04] really good job offer from back home.
[1:17:07] I'm like, I think I'm I'm gonna take
[1:17:09] this job. We're just gonna we're going
[1:17:11] to save up for a year and then we'll
[1:17:13] make it happen. And uh that that that
[1:17:17] was not I knew in my heart that wasn't
[1:17:20] what I was supposed to do. Um but I
[1:17:22] wanted to do it because it looked like
[1:17:24] more money. And uh we needed
[1:17:29] we needed to find a house anyway at that
[1:17:31] point then. And we were just I said no.
[1:17:34] I said, "We're just going to wait a
[1:17:35] year." And she was a big part in helping
[1:17:39] me to see the light because um when I
[1:17:43] said, "I'm not going to do it. I'm not
[1:17:45] going to follow the Lord." Uh
[1:17:48] I lost my desire to follow the Lord, I
[1:17:51] lost my peace. I lost my joy. I lost
[1:17:55] everything. I just wanted to throw it
[1:17:57] out the window. I just wanted to be done
[1:17:58] with it. Um, and so
[1:18:03] at that point I was I was done. I I just
[1:18:06] I was tired of people texting me. I was
[1:18:09] I just wanted to isolate and just be
[1:18:12] done with it. And she just said she said
[1:18:14] this. I don't even know if she
[1:18:16] remembers, but she's like, "Man, I feel
[1:18:17] like we need to move. I feel the call to
[1:18:20] move. So, we should move." And I'm like,
[1:18:24] "I don't know about that." And then uh I
[1:18:28] finally came to it and I'm like, "The
[1:18:30] Lord kept kept working on me." And he's
[1:18:32] like, "You know, I told you that I want
[1:18:34] you down there. I told you I want you to
[1:18:36] move and you're just rejecting me.
[1:18:38] You're telling me no." So now what I
[1:18:42] mean, I'll take it from you. I'll take
[1:18:43] that joy from you. And I said, "All
[1:18:45] right, God. All right. You do you. You
[1:18:48] do your will. We'll move. If you open
[1:18:51] the doors, you know, we'll move." And uh
[1:18:54] just like that I got my joy, my peace,
[1:18:56] my desire, my fire. Everything came
[1:18:59] back.
[1:19:04] So I can I can say that I didn't just up
[1:19:08] and move like that. Um, but then we came
[1:19:13] down for Valentine's party that Tommy
[1:19:16] put on and we're there playing games and
[1:19:19] and uh we're just there and Austin says,
[1:19:23] "When are you going to move? Are you
[1:19:24] moving?" And I'm like, "Well, I mean,
[1:19:27] yeah, but I can't find a house. We just
[1:19:29] talked about it that we needed a couple
[1:19:31] months." He's like, "I got a house
[1:19:33] coming up." I'm like, "He's probably
[1:19:34] going to want want people in it in the
[1:19:37] next month." I'm like, "I ain't going to
[1:19:38] be able to make it work." He's like,
[1:19:39] "Oh, it'll be a couple months yet." So,
[1:19:42] the Lord provided in that as well.
[1:19:44] Perfect timing. Gave us like two months
[1:19:46] to pack and and uh everything worked
[1:19:49] out. So, that's a that I can testify
[1:19:52] that the Lord provides. If you are if
[1:19:54] you're open to it and you you're you
[1:19:56] just have faith in God like God, this is
[1:19:58] this is up to you. God will provide. Uh
[1:20:02] that is a that is a that's a promise.
[1:20:05] And so, uh, we obviously made the move
[1:20:09] and, uh, the Lord blessed us with a
[1:20:11] smooth transition. Uh, I would say, um,
[1:20:14] yes, we had family, friends say that,
[1:20:18] you know, you know, you're not doing
[1:20:21] what's right. The devil's got you. Uh,
[1:20:24] you're not led of the Holy Spirit. Uh,
[1:20:26] you're, I mean, obviously tried to cast
[1:20:29] a demon out. Uh, but you know, through
[1:20:33] it all, I knew that's what the Lord
[1:20:36] wanted of me. And so, what else am I to
[1:20:39] do? It's not my It's I'm not moving. I'm
[1:20:42] not moving because I want to move. I'm
[1:20:45] moving because God called me to move.
[1:20:54] And uh it was around that time as she
[1:20:58] said, the devil wanted to uh hit her
[1:21:01] with everything and anything. And so
[1:21:04] this is where her next testimony comes
[1:21:07] in.
[1:21:10] So over the time of preparations of
[1:21:14] moving and whatnot, um I happened to
[1:21:16] injure my jaw. And so I pretty much got
[1:21:20] diagnosed with TMJ disorder. I don't
[1:21:22] know if you heard of it before, but it's
[1:21:24] when something slips in the joint, slips
[1:21:26] in the back of your jaw, and you get a
[1:21:28] lot of pain. Um it's even takes longer
[1:21:32] to heal than a sprain. Um because it's
[1:21:35] tiny little tissue of some sort.
[1:21:37] Anyways, so I dealt with that for a
[1:21:39] while and I had to be really careful
[1:21:40] with what I ate and I couldn't I hard
[1:21:42] day just could eat soft food and
[1:21:46] couldn't open my mouth very far. So, um,
[1:21:49] at the time I didn't really think about
[1:21:51] it that um, like I just thought I had
[1:21:55] it. So, I was just, you know, telling
[1:21:57] people about my problem with this. And
[1:21:59] at the time I didn't realize that I was
[1:22:00] kind of claiming it until
[1:22:04] we moved down here and the Thursday of
[1:22:08] the revival here.
[1:22:11] The first evening, a few hours before
[1:22:15] the first service, the devil hit me
[1:22:18] really hard with extreme pain. Not just
[1:22:21] in my jaw, but like it would often
[1:22:22] spread to my um chin, my neck, back of
[1:22:25] my head, everything. Like it was just
[1:22:26] paralyzing pain. And it was a few hours
[1:22:29] before the first stars and I I knew it
[1:22:31] was a attack from the devil. We both did
[1:22:34] and I couldn't like it was so bad I
[1:22:37] couldn't even open my mouth to talk
[1:22:38] hardly. And so he just prayed with me
[1:22:42] and then he started putting on some
[1:22:43] music um some of my warrior songs I
[1:22:46] guess you could call it that I like to
[1:22:47] listen to in spiritual warfare and
[1:22:49] whatnot. And through that whole time, I
[1:22:52] the realization dawned on me that I had
[1:22:54] never um actually just renounced it. And
[1:23:01] I was like, "Oh." The gear started
[1:23:03] spinning and I was like, "Okay, I'm
[1:23:05] going to start, you know, claiming my
[1:23:06] healing on this. Like, I don't have this
[1:23:08] TMJ disorder. Like, that's not mine."
[1:23:10] And um I kind of did the same thing as I
[1:23:13] did the last time. I started pacing
[1:23:15] around and I could hardly open my mouth
[1:23:17] right at first, but I kept opening my
[1:23:18] mouth more and more just, you know,
[1:23:20] claiming my healing and just praising
[1:23:22] the Lord for my healing and then it
[1:23:25] started getting better and better and
[1:23:27] then I was like, "Okay, I'm going to go
[1:23:29] to defy the pain again and eat something
[1:23:32] that I would not have eaten otherwise."
[1:23:34] So Devin was over there and he had those
[1:23:36] uh peanut walnut uh caramel clusters
[1:23:40] and I've been wanting to eat them, but I
[1:23:42] never dared. So I was just like walked
[1:23:44] over to the table and took a big chunk
[1:23:45] of it and that pain pretty much went
[1:23:47] down completely.
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:54] So I was like, "Yep, take that devil."
[1:23:56] Because um when that pain left, I was
[1:23:59] like pretty much it just felt like, you
[1:24:01] know, the devil left. It just um God
[1:24:03] gave me another victory in that and I'm
[1:24:05] so thankful for that. And we were just
[1:24:07] dancing in our living room then because
[1:24:09] we're just filled with, you know, the
[1:24:10] joy of the Lord. Um
[1:24:13] but the devil obviously came back quite
[1:24:15] a few times since then just giving me a
[1:24:18] lot of pain and aching in that area in
[1:24:21] my jaw. Um but um it has gotten a lot
[1:24:24] better because um God has given me that
[1:24:29] faith to hold on to what his word says
[1:24:31] and I'm so thankful for that. Without
[1:24:33] his strength through it all, I don't
[1:24:35] know what I would have done. Um so I
[1:24:38] just want to give him the honor and the
[1:24:40] glory. Um, God has such a loving heart
[1:24:43] and he care. He just, it just really
[1:24:45] showed me, you know, he cares about all
[1:24:47] the heartache that I go through, all the
[1:24:50] pain and everything. And I just have to
[1:24:51] believe that he does care and I just
[1:24:54] have to believe that, um, you know, he
[1:24:56] he does heal and God has really made
[1:25:00] himself manifest to me in that way. And
[1:25:03] so um during during the revival
[1:25:07] I the devil had also um tried to cast
[1:25:10] anxiety on me that last summer. Um
[1:25:16] I had dealt with a panic attack and some
[1:25:19] other issues with just anxiety, not
[1:25:22] being able to sleep and whatnot. Just
[1:25:24] feeling that like physical mental toll
[1:25:26] and it just felt like a stronghold. Um,
[1:25:31] so Saturday night I went through the
[1:25:33] prayer line. You know, that was my
[1:25:35] prayer. I wanted to be free from this
[1:25:36] anxiety. And I went through the prayer
[1:25:39] line and one I just heard one of the
[1:25:42] preachers say um something about the
[1:25:44] stronghold of anxiety, praying against
[1:25:45] the stronghold of anxiety. And while I
[1:25:48] was going through the prayer line, it
[1:25:49] just the only way that I can explain
[1:25:51] what I felt was just anxiety and fear
[1:25:54] being cast out of me. Like that's just
[1:25:56] the only way that I can explain how I
[1:25:58] felt. It was just something strong came
[1:26:00] over me and it was just like I believe
[1:26:03] I'm free of anxiety and yeah,
[1:26:09] [Applause]
[1:26:11] so praise the Lord for that. Um the
[1:26:15] devil did try to hit me with anxiety
[1:26:17] that night, but um I know I know God is
[1:26:21] with me and I don't have to worry about
[1:26:22] anything and just I am free from anxiety
[1:26:25] and God has been so good to me. Um
[1:26:30] he has healed me a few times and just um
[1:26:33] just sanctifying me and I can just feel
[1:26:35] it and I'm just so so thankful for that.
[1:26:38] Um just praise the Lord.
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:26:49] So, she went through this and I'm gonna
[1:26:52] I'm gonna say this and it rocked my
[1:26:54] world. This happened the Monday after
[1:26:57] the special meetings. We were um down at
[1:27:01] uh Tammy's parents and we were having
[1:27:04] lunch or was it supper? I don't know. Um
[1:27:06] and brother Timothy was there. Timothy
[1:27:08] Puit was there and we were hanging out
[1:27:11] there shooting the breeze and just
[1:27:14] having a good time in the Lord and and
[1:27:16] we were getting ready to leave
[1:27:18] and uh and I was sitting there eating
[1:27:22] and I looked over at her and she wasn't
[1:27:23] eating. I'm like I said, "Does your jaw
[1:27:26] hurt?" And she said, "Yeah, it does."
[1:27:28] And uh I was like, "Well, we'll see if
[1:27:30] Timothy will pray over pray over you
[1:27:33] before before we leave." And so, um, I
[1:27:36] mentioned something to Tommy and Tommy
[1:27:38] got Timothy and we got over there in a
[1:27:39] huddle kind of away from the main group
[1:27:42] and, uh, Brother Timothy prayed over us
[1:27:46] and, uh, you know, it was all good and
[1:27:49] cool and everything. It still gives me
[1:27:52] goosebumps. But um she went over to the
[1:27:56] women again and we just we were getting
[1:27:58] ready to go toss a cornhole a little bit
[1:28:01] and and I was we went in the house and
[1:28:05] we came back out and and brother Timothy
[1:28:07] says, "Hey, listen." He said, "Tommy,
[1:28:09] come here." And uh Tommy walked over and
[1:28:12] I could tell it's just something was
[1:28:14] there was like I was like, "Now what?"
[1:28:17] you know, and uh he said, you know, he
[1:28:21] said when we were at the bedside of my
[1:28:23] mother on her deathbed, he said,
[1:28:26] "Brother Ron Spencer was there and he
[1:28:28] told me to come around to the other side
[1:28:30] of the bed because the angel of the Lord
[1:28:31] is there." And he said, "I just want to
[1:28:34] tell you something." He said, "When I
[1:28:35] was praying, I opened my eyes and he
[1:28:36] said, "The angel of the Lord was
[1:28:38] standing right behind you two."
[1:28:41] And uh and he said, I didn't want to say
[1:28:43] I wasn't going to say anything, but he
[1:28:45] said, "We went in the house." He said,
[1:28:47] "I came back out and the presence was
[1:28:48] still there." And so he said, "That's
[1:28:51] when I know. That's when I knew." So he
[1:28:53] said, "You don't have to worry anymore."
[1:28:56] I mean, he didn't. He said, "You don't
[1:28:57] got to worry anymore. You ain't got to
[1:28:58] have fear, anxiety, nothing like that."
[1:29:00] He mentioned anxiety in the prayer
[1:29:02] again. I mean, just the Lord was clearly
[1:29:05] in it. And so, we just want to praise
[1:29:08] the Lord. That gives us so much um that
[1:29:11] gives us a rock to stand on when the
[1:29:14] times come, when the time's come.
[1:29:22] Um this is just a very recent thing and
[1:29:25] I'm just going to be vulnerable and open
[1:29:27] here. Um, but I dealt with, you know, I
[1:29:30] had been I was kind of addicted to
[1:29:33] vaping and uh I was just kind of going
[1:29:37] with the flow and and a while ago or a
[1:29:40] couple Sundays ago, uh, Brother Joe was
[1:29:42] here preaching and he said
[1:29:46] and he said that uh, he said, "If I
[1:29:48] asked every one of you in this church,
[1:29:49] if you have the Holy Ghost, there all
[1:29:51] your hands would probably go up." But he
[1:29:54] said, "If you're doing the same things
[1:29:57] that you've been doing, you don't have
[1:30:00] it." And the Lord started dealing with
[1:30:02] me, dealing with me in that pier. And I
[1:30:04] mean, it was like a war. I was fighting
[1:30:06] against it. And he just said, "No, you
[1:30:09] don't need to be doing that. That isn't
[1:30:11] right. That's not what I want you to
[1:30:12] do." And uh he said, "You need to you
[1:30:15] need to get rid of that thing and you
[1:30:18] need to change because when the Holy
[1:30:20] Ghost is inside you, it's going to bring
[1:30:22] a change. Your nature is going to
[1:30:24] change." And so I said, "All right,
[1:30:27] Lord." So went home from church and I
[1:30:31] didn't didn't do anything about it. And
[1:30:33] the next day I was working with Tommy
[1:30:35] and I told Tommy about the experience
[1:30:37] and he's like, "Did you do it?" I said,
[1:30:39] "No, I didn't have time." He's like,
[1:30:40] "Dude, you got to do it, man. And when
[1:30:42] the Lord makes that opportunity, you got
[1:30:44] to do it. And so, uh, and we were just
[1:30:47] there going on about our day. And I
[1:30:49] don't know if I don't know if he felt
[1:30:51] the Lord leading him to, but he just
[1:30:54] said, "Hey, you know, I want to pray
[1:30:55] over you." And so, he got up and was
[1:30:57] praying over me. And I I felt that
[1:30:59] again, and I was like, "All right, I
[1:31:02] ain't even going to think about it." So,
[1:31:03] uh, I went and grabbed that joker and I
[1:31:05] said, "You're witness to this." And I
[1:31:06] whipped that thing clean into the next
[1:31:08] timber. So, praise the Lord for that.
[1:31:17] And since then, the Lord's took my
[1:31:18] desire and no cravings. I ain't got none
[1:31:21] of that no more. So, praise God for
[1:31:23] that.
[1:31:29] I just want to That's pretty much all of
[1:31:32] it. Um, but I just wanna I just want to
[1:31:35] say, you know, lately it's because it's
[1:31:36] fresh on my mind. But, um, been having
[1:31:40] friends, family, people just, you know,
[1:31:44] spreading their words, uh, if you will.
[1:31:46] Um, been told, you know, you're
[1:31:48] following a false prophet. You're in a
[1:31:50] cult. You're you're completely out of
[1:31:52] whack here. Uh, you follow man, you do
[1:31:55] all this and all that. And I said,
[1:31:59] "Okay,
[1:32:01] you can call me what you want to, but
[1:32:04] under this ministry and under this
[1:32:06] prophet, our faith has been elevated to
[1:32:09] see spirit to see supernatural miracles
[1:32:11] happen. And so, you can't tell me. You
[1:32:14] can't tell me." It's just like brother
[1:32:16] Eduardo said last last Wednesday. He
[1:32:18] said, "If you come to tell me that the
[1:32:20] prophet ain't right, you're too late.
[1:32:23] You're too late.
[1:32:29] So that's that's pretty much all of it.
[1:32:31] And I just want to give God the glory
[1:32:33] because he's brought us through so much
[1:32:36] and all of this has happened in the last
[1:32:37] two years. And so uh the Lord has just
[1:32:40] been good to us. And he's been giving us
[1:32:43] more and more to add to our testimony.
[1:32:45] And as long as we're on this side of
[1:32:47] heaven, there will always be more to the
[1:32:50] testimony. And so we just want to give
[1:32:51] God the glory.
[1:32:54] [Applause]
[1:33:02] Thank you, brother Devin. Sister today,
[1:33:05] very good testimony. Amen. Amen. That
[1:33:09] transition from coming out of a
[1:33:11] denomination into the message is always
[1:33:14] a little hard sometimes. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:18] Family, friends, things that people say.
[1:33:21] Amen. You have to be able to stand that
[1:33:23] pers persecution and stand for what's
[1:33:25] right. Amen. How many say there's not
[1:33:28] one little bitty shadow of a doubt, but
[1:33:31] that God was with that man. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:35] God was with him. Amen. That was Jesus
[1:33:37] Christ. Amen.
[1:33:40] Praise the Lord. Amen. All right.
[1:33:42] Somebody else yet?
[1:33:45] All right. Go ahead.
[1:33:48] Is that on? Okay. Um, I didn't know
[1:33:51] ahead of time we were doing testimonies
[1:33:53] until brother Joe said something out in
[1:33:56] the vestibule, but I thought maybe he
[1:33:57] was joking.
[1:33:59] But, uh, I wrote some stuff down in the
[1:34:02] pre-ervice. Um, but I have a sign that's
[1:34:06] on my kitchen counter that says, "What
[1:34:09] if you woke up today with only the
[1:34:12] things that you thanked God for
[1:34:14] yesterday?"
[1:34:16] and uh the trials that we've went
[1:34:19] through um over the past year
[1:34:22] um it's been a little over a year now
[1:34:24] have made that so much more meaningful
[1:34:29] to me than ever. You know, I've always
[1:34:31] always been thankful um for what God
[1:34:34] does, but it just magnified it, you
[1:34:37] know, so much more.
[1:34:40] So every night when we pray, we thank
[1:34:42] God for the gift of himself down to our
[1:34:46] family, our pastor, our church, our
[1:34:48] church friends, our home, our animals,
[1:34:50] our uh clothes, the money to pay the
[1:34:53] bills, even toys for John, everything,
[1:34:56] you know. And then every morning, the
[1:35:00] first thing we thank God for keeping us
[1:35:03] safe through the night.
[1:35:16] and just for giving us another day.
[1:35:23] Because truly each day and each moment
[1:35:29] is a gift from God.
[1:35:35] And
[1:35:38] something that really helped me recently
[1:35:42] um because I had experienced several
[1:35:45] miracles actually miracles of healing in
[1:35:48] my own body my children's body um the
[1:35:53] older kids you know as they were growing
[1:35:54] up just outright instant miracles
[1:35:59] and uh
[1:36:01] so
[1:36:03] this time it's been um different. And I
[1:36:07] heard brother Brandham I heard it said
[1:36:09] just the other day how brother Brandham
[1:36:10] explained that a miracle is something,
[1:36:14] you know, that happens pretty much
[1:36:15] instantly, but a healing can take time.
[1:36:20] And I'm sure I'd heard that before, but
[1:36:23] I don't know. I
[1:36:25] just um
[1:36:28] it's just
[1:36:32] Been
[1:36:38] a battle. Like Jana said, the devil
[1:36:41] comes in.
[1:36:51] He tries to bring, you know, fear and
[1:36:54] doubt
[1:36:56] even, you know, down to, you know,
[1:36:58] what's wrong with you?
[1:37:00] you know, every time before, you know,
[1:37:03] it worked. You know, you got a miracle.
[1:37:05] What's wrong with you now?
[1:37:09] And uh which I encourage I've always
[1:37:13] encouraged my kids and everybody, you
[1:37:16] know, if you get hit with something,
[1:37:17] first thing you do, of course, is clean
[1:37:19] out your closet. You know, make sure
[1:37:20] everything's right with the Lord. It's
[1:37:22] what Brother Brandham taught us, you
[1:37:24] know, and in his message. Um, but, you
[1:37:28] know, I had done all that. I knew
[1:37:31] everything was right
[1:37:33] with the Lord. And
[1:37:36] um
[1:37:38] but you know, he said sometimes he just
[1:37:40] wants to see what you'll do.
[1:37:44] And uh
[1:37:48] this time I thank God that you know he's
[1:37:51] let us experience his healing power.
[1:37:55] And God is mindful.
[1:37:58] He's mindful of us. And like I said, it
[1:38:00] just really it really helped me helped
[1:38:03] to stabilize me, I guess you'd say the
[1:38:06] other day when I heard him explain that,
[1:38:08] you know, that it's different. Sometimes
[1:38:10] he heals by miracles. Sometimes it's a
[1:38:13] healing that takes time, you know, but
[1:38:15] you, like she said, you keep believing.
[1:38:17] You keep confessing it, you know, and
[1:38:19] and your body will walk into it. So, I
[1:38:24] just uh want to thank God again for
[1:38:27] healing Jonathan.
[1:38:29] We appreciate it so much. And by his
[1:38:32] stripes, Jonathan is healed.
[1:38:35] [Applause]
[1:38:46] The Lord, thank you.
[1:38:48] Appreciate that. Amen.
[1:38:51] Brother Austin, go ahead.
[1:38:55] That came from uh our meetings that we
[1:38:57] had a few weeks ago. Um I'm kind of in
[1:39:00] the same boat with Jana when it comes to
[1:39:02] public speaking. So um the first one is
[1:39:05] just going back to that is just the the
[1:39:08] freedom that God gave me to worship him.
[1:39:10] I'm sure you guys seen me running around
[1:39:12] here. I'm kind of hard to miss. So um
[1:39:15] just able to do that. You know, there's
[1:39:16] been times where the Holy Spirit will
[1:39:18] fall and you're like, man, you know, I'd
[1:39:20] like to kind of I told Tommy before
[1:39:22] like, man, I'm almost took off running,
[1:39:23] you know. And it's just to be able to
[1:39:25] experience that. It was a really neat
[1:39:27] experience, you know. Um the other two
[1:39:30] things he did for me kind of correlate
[1:39:32] with each other before the meetings, you
[1:39:34] know, everybody was kind of anticipating
[1:39:36] the uh you know, what God was going to
[1:39:38] do and stuff. So, I just kind of felt in
[1:39:41] my heart to write on a piece of paper
[1:39:44] needs that I had in my life and that I
[1:39:46] wanted, you know, God to meet in my
[1:39:48] family's life.
[1:39:50] Um, and I put them in Acts 19 and you
[1:39:53] know, because that's where you put your
[1:39:54] uh prayer cloth and stuff. This is what
[1:39:57] I usually am a crier. Um anyway, so but
[1:40:01] whenever brother Andrew had the prayer
[1:40:04] line, I just felt to get those needs out
[1:40:06] of my hand and uh so I went in the
[1:40:09] prayer line and I always kind of want
[1:40:12] something where God will like build your
[1:40:14] faith. So I'm like, Lord, whenever I go
[1:40:16] up here, please, you know, help them to
[1:40:18] pray or to say something that I know
[1:40:21] that you'll meet these needs, you know.
[1:40:23] And as soon as I went up there and I was
[1:40:24] explaining to him what I did, you know,
[1:40:26] writing it on a piece of paper and all
[1:40:27] that and he just said like I can't
[1:40:29] remember the exact words but like you
[1:40:30] know you're the knee that I've been
[1:40:31] waiting on or you're you know this is
[1:40:33] the knee that you know I've been waiting
[1:40:35] on something to that effect and I just
[1:40:37] knew that you know just that few minutes
[1:40:40] of me standing in the prayer line God
[1:40:42] heard my prayer and answered me and gave
[1:40:43] me confirmation you know that he would
[1:40:45] meet the needs that I wrote on my piece
[1:40:48] of paper you know and I don't want to
[1:40:50] just limit him you know he's a big God I
[1:40:52] don't want to limit him to just needs
[1:40:54] that I have on a piece of paper. We have
[1:40:56] needs that come up every day of our
[1:40:58] life, you know, and I just uh just want
[1:41:01] to put my whole life, my family's life,
[1:41:03] everybody into his hands. And, you know,
[1:41:05] know that he'll carry us through. And I
[1:41:07] want to I want to thank him for the
[1:41:08] church, too. I just the last year or
[1:41:10] two, I believe that our church is
[1:41:13] skyrocketed spiritually. And, you know,
[1:41:16] I love it and I just thank God for it.
[1:41:18] Amen.
[1:41:19] [Applause]
[1:41:36] I appreciate y'all's prayers this week.
[1:41:38] Um,
[1:41:40] I thought I was the man, I guess, built
[1:41:43] like Tommy and tried to lift something I
[1:41:46] should have never lift. and I've pulled
[1:41:47] a muscle in my chest. And honestly, I
[1:41:50] don't know that I've ever been in that
[1:41:52] much pain since my back surgery. So, I
[1:41:54] really appreciate y'all's prayers and it
[1:41:57] hurts to take a deep breath. So, please
[1:41:59] continue to pray for me. But,
[1:42:02] um, I wanted to thank the Lord. When we
[1:42:04] were in Florida, I got behind on a
[1:42:07] couple services, so I was trying to
[1:42:08] catch up. And
[1:42:10] I believe it was Sunday night that
[1:42:12] brother Joe was preaching
[1:42:15] and he was talking about how that you
[1:42:19] have to know that you know that you know
[1:42:21] that you've been quickened and I'm so
[1:42:24] thankful to be able to look at my life
[1:42:25] and know that God has quickened me. Um
[1:42:30] he said that God would not only change
[1:42:33] your your present or your future but he
[1:42:35] also changes your past. And I never
[1:42:38] heard he heard that quite like that. And
[1:42:41] if you was a sinner like me, you're very
[1:42:43] thankful that God changes your past.
[1:42:47] You just want to say boo devil and all
[1:42:50] of your friends. If you want to go
[1:42:51] fishing, you can. But my past has been
[1:42:54] changed and I'm very thankful for that.
[1:42:58] Um God knew too. Um, I promised him a
[1:43:03] couple years ago if he gave me the or
[1:43:05] maybe it was a year and I told Brother
[1:43:07] Thomas I had a testimony if it ever
[1:43:09] worked out that I could give it. But we
[1:43:12] had to go back to court for Michael. And
[1:43:14] um, when we went, me and the twins were
[1:43:17] very, very nervous. We had never been in
[1:43:19] a a room with the murderers and we
[1:43:25] hadn't been to court in a very long
[1:43:26] time. And so it was very nerve-wracking.
[1:43:31] And I had wrote out my speech, but it
[1:43:33] kept coming to me that
[1:43:36] um we shouldn't prepare ourselves for
[1:43:38] times like that, that God will speak
[1:43:39] through us if we'll just let him. So, I
[1:43:42] had all this mess wrote out and it was
[1:43:44] just cuz I was nervous. But,
[1:43:47] um when we went in that day, the judge
[1:43:50] explained to us that the most he could
[1:43:52] get is six more years without a chance
[1:43:54] for parole.
[1:43:56] And um so I immediately started claiming
[1:43:59] it. I was like, he's getting six more
[1:44:01] years today. He ain't getting out of
[1:44:04] this joint. He's staying. And so, um,
[1:44:09] the judge started explaining to us how
[1:44:10] it works. And then the first thing they
[1:44:12] do, too, is they explain to you how his,
[1:44:16] um, prison time has went. I think it was
[1:44:19] 192 writeups he had had in prison. Soon
[1:44:23] as I heard it, I was like, there ain't
[1:44:25] no way this boy's getting out. But you
[1:44:27] know, we live in a wicked world. And so
[1:44:32] um he said a few smart elic things, this
[1:44:36] guy did. And um ever since it happened,
[1:44:40] it's been 30 years now, but my heart's
[1:44:42] desire was ever since it happened, I
[1:44:44] wanted a judge to stand up and say the
[1:44:48] Westerman's done absolutely nothing
[1:44:50] wrong that night. And and that's exactly
[1:44:54] what happened. because I know that they
[1:44:57] tried to say that things happened. There
[1:44:59] was words between us and I was the only
[1:45:01] one that knew that was a lie. But how
[1:45:04] can you tell the world? But that day at
[1:45:06] court that that judge said the
[1:45:10] Westerman's was out for a family evening
[1:45:12] and y'all ambushed them.
[1:45:15] And so after after the court, my
[1:45:18] father-in-law came up to me and said,
[1:45:20] "Hannah, all I can say is God spoke
[1:45:23] through you today." And I believe I
[1:45:26] really believe the judge took to heart
[1:45:28] what I what the Lord said through me and
[1:45:30] also used Austin too and um we got six
[1:45:36] more years. So I'm very thankful for
[1:45:38] that. Um also as a mom my whole mom
[1:45:44] career I've never I've told my kids a
[1:45:47] million times you could become a
[1:45:48] millionaire. That would mean nothing to
[1:45:50] me. I want your soul saved. And I would
[1:45:54] encourage y'all, I've talked to Grace
[1:45:56] and I think Natalie, but I'd encourage
[1:45:58] anybody that has kids, sacrifice. Do
[1:46:02] whatever you have to do. You get your
[1:46:04] kids to camp meetings. You take them
[1:46:07] anywhere you can go. You don't take a
[1:46:10] lot of money. There's believers all over
[1:46:12] this world that'll put you right up in
[1:46:13] their house. Um, but I don't regret
[1:46:17] doing it one minute. Most of the time it
[1:46:20] was just me and Sarah out taking them,
[1:46:24] taking our kids. But by his grace, all
[1:46:27] four of our kids are serving the Lord
[1:46:30] and um filled with the Holy Ghost. I
[1:46:32] believe.
[1:46:38] So, I'm very thankful for that. And just
[1:46:40] one last thing, I know y'all don't
[1:46:42] believe in women preachers, so I'll keep
[1:46:44] it short.
[1:46:48] Oh, I shouldn't have done that.
[1:46:52] Um, but God also has blessed me with two
[1:46:55] more kids, Caroline and Lacy. And
[1:46:57] they've been like mine since the day I
[1:46:59] was born. And um, so y'all pray for
[1:47:02] them. They have a hard time sometimes,
[1:47:04] but um, they had both been really
[1:47:07] desiring the Holy Spirit. And last year
[1:47:10] they went to Ohio. Well, I always call
[1:47:12] it Ohio Youth Camp, but BYC. and I'm
[1:47:15] going to tell it because I know they
[1:47:16] won't. But um Lacy texted me one night
[1:47:21] and said, "Ain't Hannah, I got it. I got
[1:47:24] the Holy Ghost." And so I was texting
[1:47:26] back and forth with her
[1:47:29] and um the next night I got a phone call
[1:47:32] and Caroline said, "And Hannah, I got
[1:47:34] it." And I said, "What did you get?" She
[1:47:37] said, "I got the Holy Ghost." And I've
[1:47:40] seen their lives change so much. And I'm
[1:47:44] very very thankful.
[1:47:48] [Applause]
[1:47:59] Anyone else?
[1:48:04] Brother Glenn,
[1:48:10] thank you. I just want to talk about the
[1:48:12] last five years or so. I can uh I can
[1:48:16] thank my brother Sean and sister Patty.
[1:48:19] They drugged me in here.
[1:48:22] And Lord, I cannot believe it, but I
[1:48:25] hadn't missed a Sunday or a Wednesday
[1:48:28] unless I just absolutely had to since
[1:48:30] then. And I can thank them so much
[1:48:33] because when Sean was talking about all
[1:48:37] this, I didn't I thought he was crazy.
[1:48:40] But but I I learned he's right. So
[1:48:43] anyway, and I'm going to tell you one
[1:48:46] thing.
[1:48:48] When I was young, I used to do the
[1:48:51] marijuana. If I wanted to hit a joint
[1:48:53] when we came back from a mission, we'd
[1:48:55] go to the combo tent. That's the
[1:48:57] communications tent. Those boys always
[1:49:00] had a few buds over there so we could
[1:49:02] hit it and have a good old time. But
[1:49:05] anyway,
[1:49:06] I had a bad problem gambling. I gambled
[1:49:10] my house away way back a long time ago.
[1:49:14] Then I gambled another house away
[1:49:17] and I just couldn't let it go. We came
[1:49:20] here. I asked my preacher. I said,
[1:49:23] "Should I be gambling?" He said, "Well,
[1:49:25] that's kind of up to you. you make that
[1:49:28] decision. So, the Lord and I, we had a
[1:49:30] talk one night.
[1:49:33] And I'm going to tell you something. I
[1:49:35] have not set foot in the casino
[1:49:38] in two years.
[1:49:41] It was
[1:49:43] I had I cannot believe it, but it was
[1:49:46] just like he took the urge away. The
[1:49:48] same way with the vaping. I stopped
[1:49:50] smoking, but I went right to vaping
[1:49:53] because that was good, too. But I
[1:49:55] thought it was more healthy. But anyway,
[1:49:57] it turns out it was bad. So the Lord
[1:49:59] told me to get rid of that too along
[1:50:01] with her. So we did. And anyway, I just
[1:50:05] want to thank all of you, this whole
[1:50:08] bride sitting here because you have all
[1:50:11] changed this old center as I told
[1:50:14] brother Tommy back when I starting in
[1:50:18] 1966 up until about five years ago, I
[1:50:21] was sinning and grinning having the best
[1:50:22] old time of my life. But now I know what
[1:50:25] a good time is
[1:50:27] and I appreciate everyone. Thank you.
[1:50:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. We're very
[1:50:36] thankful for the work of grace that God
[1:50:40] does. Amen. We've seen it change and
[1:50:42] change one thing after another. Praise
[1:50:45] the Lord. Praise God. God is good, isn't
[1:50:47] he?
[1:50:49] Amen. Very good.
[1:50:52] I got one more thing that I'd like to
[1:50:55] say that I forgot to say, but we just
[1:50:57] want to thank you guys as a church for
[1:50:59] accepting us and for uh the love
[1:51:01] offering that you guys lifted for us. We
[1:51:03] just want to thank you guys so much for
[1:51:05] that. Uh we really appreciate it. I just
[1:51:07] want to thank you, brother Ber, for
[1:51:09] being our pastor and and being there for
[1:51:12] us. And I just want to uh bless you and
[1:51:15] you also, brother Brad, and you guys
[1:51:17] ministry and and just just want to just
[1:51:21] want to thank you guys. Amen. God bless
[1:51:23] you. Amen.
[1:51:24] [Applause]
[1:51:28] Amen.
[1:51:38] I wasn't going to say anything, but um I
[1:51:42] could tell a lot of testimonies, but I
[1:51:45] was just feeling like I should tell this
[1:51:46] one. Um when I was like 14, somewhere
[1:51:52] around there. I like really struggled to
[1:51:56] go to sleep every night and well, not
[1:51:58] every night, but a lot of nights. And
[1:52:01] I'm someone who needs sleep a lot and um
[1:52:05] it would just like the devil would come
[1:52:07] in my mind during the day and it'd be
[1:52:09] like you're not going to be able to fall
[1:52:10] asleep tonight and I would just like
[1:52:11] battle it the whole day and then I'd lay
[1:52:15] down at like 10 o'clock at night and I'd
[1:52:17] still be awake at 2 o'clock in the
[1:52:18] morning and I would just be like what in
[1:52:21] the world and I'd play brother Brandham.
[1:52:23] I'd go sleep somewhere else, sleep on
[1:52:26] the couch. I'd do whatever and I could
[1:52:29] not fall asleep and I just I'd have my
[1:52:32] dad pray for me. And finally, like this
[1:52:35] went on for I don't know a year or two
[1:52:37] maybe. And um after
[1:52:42] um
[1:52:44] one night of having a rough night trying
[1:52:45] to fall asleep, uh we were just as a
[1:52:48] family at lunch and my dad was like, you
[1:52:52] know, that's just like the devil trying
[1:52:53] to torment you. Like you don't have to
[1:52:55] deal with that. so why don't you go up
[1:52:57] for prayer tonight because it was
[1:52:59] Wednesday night and so I went up for
[1:53:02] prayer and um
[1:53:05] I nothing was super like emotional about
[1:53:07] it or anything like that but I just had
[1:53:10] a piece in my heart I was like I'm not
[1:53:12] going to have to deal with this again
[1:53:14] and so I went back to my seat and I was
[1:53:16] just praising the Lord and um just every
[1:53:20] night like it went away and the devil
[1:53:23] would come back randomly and I would be
[1:53:25] like, "No, I can take you to the place
[1:53:28] in the front of that church that I got
[1:53:29] delivered of that. I'm not dealing with
[1:53:31] that." And
[1:53:37] there's one verse that I always like
[1:53:39] quoted to myself and um cuz sleep is
[1:53:43] kind of a random thing like you're like,
[1:53:46] "Is is that a promise?" But it is. In
[1:53:48] Proverbs 3:24, it says, "When you lie
[1:53:51] down, you will not be afraid. When you
[1:53:53] lie down, your sleep will be sweet." And
[1:53:55] that's just a promise that you have
[1:53:58] found that sweet fleet.
[1:54:01] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:54:10] Amen.
[1:54:16] Okay. Several years ago when we were
[1:54:18] still in the little church down here, um
[1:54:21] I had gone up for prayer because
[1:54:24] something that was bothering me and
[1:54:26] seemed like as a parent like we weren't
[1:54:31] what we should be or whatever. And
[1:54:36] that always bothered me. But I went up
[1:54:38] for something else for prayer.
[1:54:41] And
[1:54:43] anyway, the Lord came to me and said,
[1:54:45] "All your children are going to be
[1:54:47] there." And I've been holding on to that
[1:54:50] ever since then. It's like somebody said
[1:54:53] one time, "How could Abraham wait 25
[1:54:55] years?" I said, "If God tells you
[1:54:57] something, it's there and I know they're
[1:55:00] going to be there." And then of course
[1:55:03] when Hannah's second boy was born and
[1:55:07] he had a tuft of hair sticking out of
[1:55:09] his head and you know, we didn't know
[1:55:10] what that meant, anything good or bad,
[1:55:12] but anyway, the doctor Vanderbilt said,
[1:55:15] "Well, we got to do surgery." So, he was
[1:55:17] just a few months old when they when
[1:55:20] they removed that. It was I just said,
[1:55:23] you know, we just kind of joked that
[1:55:24] some of the robbers have some uh Native
[1:55:27] American in them. And so I said, well,
[1:55:28] that's our Indian chief, you know, with
[1:55:30] his hair sticking out, you know, it was
[1:55:32] diff a different color than his his
[1:55:35] reddish brown hair. But anyway, so he
[1:55:38] was just a few months old and they
[1:55:40] removed that. And then when he was about
[1:55:43] two or three years old, he started
[1:55:46] having a get getting sick with a cold or
[1:55:49] something it looked like. And then he he
[1:55:52] went back to the they kept taking him to
[1:55:54] the doctor and giving him antibox over
[1:55:57] and over and over and over again. He
[1:55:59] they'd get over it and then he'd get it
[1:56:01] and he they he wasn't getting better. So
[1:56:03] finally they took him to Vanderbilt and
[1:56:06] the first they they went straight to his
[1:56:10] head and started scanning it and the
[1:56:12] first call we got is he's got brain
[1:56:14] tumors
[1:56:16] and um of course what it ended up being
[1:56:18] it wasn't then they checked it again. It
[1:56:20] was AVMs in his head. He had three
[1:56:25] and it's unusual to have them but he had
[1:56:28] three. one right in the back and one I
[1:56:31] think it was three and one on this side
[1:56:33] and I don't know where all else but
[1:56:36] so what was happening is he was bleeding
[1:56:39] in his brain and he was taking it was
[1:56:43] weakening his body and he couldn't fight
[1:56:45] off the infections. So that's how they
[1:56:48] found out that's what he had. So when he
[1:56:50] turned,
[1:56:52] they did radiation in his brain and all
[1:56:55] that and then they um said we'll have to
[1:56:58] operate.
[1:57:00] So anyway, I'm not going to go into all
[1:57:01] of that. It's really really hard. But
[1:57:05] anyway, he was he had just turned
[1:57:09] four, I believe,
[1:57:12] when they did the surgery on him and he
[1:57:15] had 50% chance to live after that. And
[1:57:18] then that the the report afterwards, it
[1:57:21] took a lot longer than they thought.
[1:57:23] He'll have 50% chance to live. And then
[1:57:25] if he does, we'll see how much brain
[1:57:27] damage it did. Well, anyway, he he had
[1:57:30] to learn how to talk and walk and
[1:57:32] everything all over again. Couldn't eat,
[1:57:35] just is just in terrible pain. So
[1:57:37] anyway, he got to where he was, you
[1:57:40] know, doing better. And he you always
[1:57:42] had to watch him because he wasn't as
[1:57:44] strong. He was kind of weak, but he did
[1:57:47] learn how to walk and he he was a fun
[1:57:50] loving little kid and um so um
[1:57:56] one time he was at our house
[1:58:00] I don't know what year sister Joyce your
[1:58:02] dad passed away
[1:58:05] 2018 okay one time it was before then
[1:58:08] that he was at our house and he needed
[1:58:11] help he he couldn't reach to to get his
[1:58:14] socks on I mean he could use both hands
[1:58:16] but his right hand was a a little bit
[1:58:17] weaker, but he could do both hands. But
[1:58:19] he couldn't get his socks on. So, I had
[1:58:21] him laid back in Steve's recliner and I
[1:58:23] would put his socks on. He says, "Mom, I
[1:58:25] just I just can't do them myself." I
[1:58:27] said, "It's okay, Josh. I I know. I I'm
[1:58:30] here to help you." And uh so time went
[1:58:34] on. And then um
[1:58:39] one time when I was fixing the bed, one
[1:58:42] morning I was just fixing the bed.
[1:58:44] didn't even think about anything like
[1:58:46] that.
[1:58:48] And and all of a sudden, the thought
[1:58:51] came to me. I remembered doing that with
[1:58:55] Josh. And I hadn't even been thinking
[1:58:56] about Josh, but all of a sudden, the
[1:58:58] thought just came across my mind of that
[1:59:01] situation where I helped him with the
[1:59:03] socks and it's and he said, "I can't do
[1:59:07] that, Mom. I'm by myself." I said, "That
[1:59:09] came across." And immediately right
[1:59:10] behind it, it said, "And he's healed. I
[1:59:14] said, "What was that?" I wasn't even
[1:59:16] thinking about Josh. And I thought,
[1:59:19] "Well, the Bible says by his stripes
[1:59:22] he's healed." Okay. So, I think it was
[1:59:26] God. And so, you know, just something in
[1:59:29] I mean, I wasn't, you know, just I said,
[1:59:31] "I I guess it was God." And I didn't see
[1:59:34] any results or anything. And I remember
[1:59:36] the reason I know is right that happened
[1:59:38] about the time when brother Billy went
[1:59:40] on because I remember telling somebody
[1:59:43] at the funeral home that that had just
[1:59:44] happened. I said, "I guess it means he's
[1:59:47] healed." But and then the first thing
[1:59:49] that came is my mom before she passed
[1:59:51] away, she said she was healed. And then
[1:59:53] she went on to be with the Lord. So I
[1:59:56] thought, I don't know, maybe he's going
[1:59:58] to go on to be with the Lord and be
[1:59:59] healed that way, but I believe he's
[2:00:01] healed. And after that, he had passed
[2:00:04] out at their house and
[2:00:07] no response. They took him to Vanderbelt
[2:00:10] with ambulance.
[2:00:13] and he had had a really bad brain bleed.
[2:00:17] And after he got there, he started
[2:00:20] throwing up, woke up and was throwing
[2:00:22] up. And so,
[2:00:28] so after that, then his right side has
[2:00:31] gotten
[2:00:33] slowly gotten worse and worse to where
[2:00:35] his he can has no use of his right hand.
[2:00:39] It's just dangling. It's It's hanging
[2:00:41] more than what I can do that. It's just
[2:00:43] hanging there. It's stiff and his right
[2:00:46] foot's dragging and he's he's on hospice
[2:00:50] care. He could go at any minute because
[2:00:52] he's got aneurysm behind his left eye
[2:00:55] and he's still got the stuff in his head
[2:00:56] and they just there's nothing they can
[2:00:58] do. So, the hospice nurse comes over
[2:01:01] every week. Hannah's got the medicine
[2:01:03] there,
[2:01:05] everything that she would need for it to
[2:01:07] be over. And um so the other day when he
[2:01:12] found out the other grandkids were going
[2:01:14] fishing, he wanted to go fishing. So we
[2:01:16] said, "Okay, we'll let you go fishing,
[2:01:18] too." He didn't really enjoy it that
[2:01:20] much, but he wanted to do it. So we we
[2:01:23] helped him get there and get his chair
[2:01:24] and get him comfortable and stuff. Well,
[2:01:26] when on the way home, he fell asleep in
[2:01:29] Steve's truck.
[2:01:31] And so we had his seat laid back, so it
[2:01:34] was pouring rain. He hates to get wet.
[2:01:37] Hannah says he just doesn't want to get
[2:01:39] wet. So So we we Hannah and I got there
[2:01:43] ahead and Steve pulled up to the carport
[2:01:45] so that his door Josh's door was facing
[2:01:48] us and he's laying in there sleeping and
[2:01:51] so we are getting ready to get him out.
[2:01:54] Well, it was pouring so as soon as it
[2:01:57] sort of let up, we said, "We better get
[2:01:58] him out now because it's just sprinkling
[2:02:00] a little." We opened the door and we
[2:02:02] said, "Come on, Josh." and he didn't
[2:02:04] really wake up, but we helped him out
[2:02:06] anyway because it's going to pour again,
[2:02:08] you know. And so, just as we got him and
[2:02:11] got him onto the carport, he went into a
[2:02:13] seizure. And he's never done that
[2:02:15] before. Uh maybe slight ones, but
[2:02:18] nothing like this. And so, we laid him
[2:02:23] down on the carport on the concrete and
[2:02:25] got Parker and got a bunch of pillows
[2:02:27] and put under him. and uh and it lasted
[2:02:32] maybe about two minutes and then they
[2:02:34] picked him up and carried him and put
[2:02:35] him on the couch and he was out, you
[2:02:38] know, sleeping. So, there's been
[2:02:40] different times when Hannah cannot wake
[2:02:42] him up and she's never made him get up.
[2:02:45] She's waited till he wakes up on his
[2:02:47] own. Well, this time when we made him
[2:02:50] get up, she said, "Well, maybe he would
[2:02:52] have gotten into a seizure before if I
[2:02:53] would have made him get up." We don't
[2:02:55] know. But anyway, she called the hospice
[2:02:57] nurse and said when he comes to this is
[2:02:59] the medicine you need. So Gabe ran back
[2:03:01] to their house and got the medicine
[2:03:03] because she's got anything she needs
[2:03:05] there. She said what she needed to give
[2:03:07] him to relax him and everything. So um
[2:03:11] anyway,
[2:03:13] he came he came he woke up after a
[2:03:16] little while in hand and gave him the
[2:03:17] medicine and his right arm's been
[2:03:19] hurting more since then. Maybe from the
[2:03:21] tenseness of how he was throwing up so
[2:03:24] much. I don't know.
[2:03:26] But I'm just saying all that to let you
[2:03:28] know that I sent the sisters a thing
[2:03:30] saying that Josh had been in a seizure.
[2:03:32] But Hannah's even told me the other day,
[2:03:35] she said, "I believe what you said. I
[2:03:38] believe he's healed. He might be going
[2:03:40] no, he might be going crossing over and
[2:03:43] he's healed or he might be healed." But
[2:03:45] she said, "It could happen real quick."
[2:03:46] I said, "Yeah, it could. But we're
[2:03:48] believing Josh is healed and our kids
[2:03:51] our kids are going to be there.
[2:03:56] [Applause]
[2:04:01] Amen. Thank you. How many's enjoyed the
[2:04:04] testimony meeting? Praise the Lord.
[2:04:08] Well, we'll quit for tonight. And if you
[2:04:11] have more, let me know. And Amen. If we
[2:04:13] have another service, we'll do it again.
[2:04:15] Is that okay?
[2:04:17] All right. Go ahead, brother Joe.
[2:04:24] All right.
[2:04:28] They can't hear you on the internet,
[2:04:30] though.
[2:04:41] Is it working? Yeah. All right. Look, I
[2:04:44] got what I got. Hope all y'all did, but
[2:04:46] I got exactly what I come to church for.
[2:04:50] You know, y'all know what I said in
[2:04:51] there. You know, a lot of us talk. We We
[2:04:54] wanted to what we're talking about is we
[2:04:57] wanted to hear every one of y'all that
[2:04:59] talked tonight. That's what we wanted to
[2:05:02] hear. You know, Brother Balor, y'all
[2:05:04] hear him talk. Brother Brad, me, Brother
[2:05:06] David, and then we said, "Bro Steve,
[2:05:09] don't say nothing." That's what we said
[2:05:11] in prayer meeting. Okay? And then
[2:05:13] brother Balor I will confess after y'all
[2:05:16] went out everybody see brother Ber needs
[2:05:18] two more to do testimony. So they was
[2:05:21] one doing them and that's what they was
[2:05:23] talking about. Then like brother Devon
[2:05:25] sister Jana I didn't even know they
[2:05:27] could talk. I said can y'all do
[2:05:29] testimony two more. Then this is why I
[2:05:33] say this. Then I got concerned. I said
[2:05:35] my goodness they couldn't talk longer
[2:05:37] than that man did last Wednesday night.
[2:05:39] We're going to be here a long time. So,
[2:05:42] and I'm real I'm real proud. I'm real
[2:05:44] proud of everyone, but them two really.
[2:05:47] Yes. I am more proud and we've told them
[2:05:50] and Hannah has from the time they come
[2:05:52] they got our number. If they ever need
[2:05:54] anything, we'll be the mom and daddy and
[2:05:57] they be the kids. That's right. So, I
[2:05:59] just we really appreciate I'll be able
[2:06:02] to remember every testimony. I don't
[2:06:04] know if I could ever do it. everything
[2:06:05] that was said on each one and that and
[2:06:07] I'm just I was really encouraged myself
[2:06:11] by everything that I heard and I just
[2:06:14] want to say praise the Lord and I love
[2:06:15] every one of you.
[2:06:18] [Applause]
