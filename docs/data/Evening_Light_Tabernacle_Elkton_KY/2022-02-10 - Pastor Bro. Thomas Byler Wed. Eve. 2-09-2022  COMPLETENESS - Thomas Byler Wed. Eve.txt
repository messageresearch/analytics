testimony you want to give do you want brother glenn yeah digit is that bad huh oh my a really bad one well we praise the lord for his healing huh is she all right he helped you out too didn't you god bless you man when he blessed him with a good wife right well let's praise the lord let's give the lord a hand and say thank you lord jesus amen amen praise the lord well we are pretty much loaded and ready to go in the morning so y'all pray for us amen locked and loaded for bear brother joe amen and so we've been busy trying to get everything ready and uh what was it i told the boys that says make sure you cross all your eyes and dot your t's i said that's my dad this is he got it wrong already but anyway you know all the little things trying to make sure everything's there so praise the lord but anyway so god bless you it's good i'm just glad to be a christian amen and so i was just searching and trying to find something of the lord and amen and just a simple little thought came to me so we'll share that with you tonight if that's okay amen and it is pulling off of once uh once again this just the thought of completion came to my heart completion amen so that's what we want to speak on this evening with the help of the lord um let's just bow our heads brother uh brother ben nora will be with y'all sunday amen and then brother danny will speak for y'all next wednesday and then brother brad the following sunday amen so let's just pray for them lord jesus we come before you lord thank the lord jesus to be christians to be your children lord to be able to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in christ jesus and to be able to open your word lord jesus and ask you to just help us and inspire us and bring out the thought of it lord jesus for we know it takes you to truly to open that word to us we ask god the justice bless meditation of our heart lord that which we feel lord you've laid upon our hearts to speak for a little bit this morning i mean this evening lord and we just ask god you'd be with all those out there lord father on watching tonight that you just blessed them in a special way we do thank you lord jesus for sparing brother glenn lord and lord let him have us have him for a little while longer lord we pray god you'll give him long life lord as he serves you and his wife and his family and everyone we ask god now that you'll just bless the reading of the word in jesus christ's name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will and we'll start with colossians 2 colossians 2 completion and when you talk about completion or fullness or perfection amen amen amen so colossians 2 and we'll read verse 9 and 10. for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power may god had his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated now i want to read a quote that i read a couple weeks ago that my mind went back to it after i began to study this and think about it and i realized that it certainly ties in with what we've been speaking about amen and they're talking about completion or being complete being complete amen amen now brother batman makes a statement he says it's just like you if you are a christian god don't make halfway christians god makes complete christians amen uh you know but we might rephrase that tonight [Music] and say that god brings christians amen god brings us to completion amen because god is working on us isn't he and he knows where every one of us is and let me just challenge you in the opening of the service here challenge you a little bit to go in your mind and ask if god is looking at you where do you think that god sees you as being in reference to completion amen isn't that a good question to ask ourselves where am i with god if he's trying to complete me but it's even good god bless you i know you've had that stuff too amen so god bless you good to see you tonight amen glad you're feeling better also my boys had it it certainly has been going around but hopefully it's starting to diminish now amen so praise the lord in reference to completion you look at yourself and say lord where i am amen now i just took quite a few different scriptures that i want to try to refer to in different perhaps scenarios that paul talked about jesus talked about uh you know in reference to being complete amen in uh ephesians 4 will be our next scripture let's go to ephesians 4. excuse me and remember when i talk about completion i also mean in a way of perfection amen you know whenever everything's when you complete something it's in the place that it should be it should be at a place of perfection amen and that's not what god's working on us isn't he amen and so i look at myself and i say lord where am i amen and you know i was just went through my mind lord if i live another 15 years 20 years no matter how long i live my heart's desire i trust it's yours too and that is lord teach me your ways how many loves to learn things in the spiritual realm spiritually i love the lord to teach me stuff i hope you do too you love for god to show you things to teach you things amen it causes you to continue to grow amen and so let's read this here you know it says that when he ascended and so forth he also descended in verse 11 of chapter four it says and he gave some apostles some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints right how many of these that's god's god too it come and it taught us into the causing us to be completely in him complete in him perfect perfect in him amen oh my so he says the perfecting of the saints the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto a perfect man i mean that was probably god preached this a message called the stature of a perfect man and he used all those different things virtue and tempers we'll get into that here in peter because that's another illustration i want to use and talk on for a little bit so we're just certainly going to just hit the highlights of all these different things that we could take for a long time you know with the help of the spirit on it but it says you know unto it for unto e let me hold on where are we at unto a perfect man unto the measure and i don't truly completely understand this but it says unto the measure of the stature so there's a measure of a stature that god's looking for of the fullness of christ amen until the fullness of christ amen that he hands forth be no more children all right so now we understand where paul's going he's talking about growing up into him amen no more children but be adults and completely grown complete man complete women no more tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slightest man and coming craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking truth in love i don't know what's wrong my throat but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly fit left join together and compacted by that by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effects you are working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself and love so we realize that paul is actually talking about a body that is all fitly together every joint everything is in perfect harmony that right you know and i had to think you know because the devil wants you to be incomplete now you know uh unfinished or my might say deformed right deformity go back in the god of his evil age 1960 before i believe it is brother i'm talking about the power of transformation he talks about that if the devil has had 6 000 years to deform right or to pervert and he used the illustration of how that in a corn field whenever there's corn growing and so forth there's what they call those little creepers vines things that wrap themselves up around those those corn and so forth and amen if you let them grow they'll twist that corn sideways and they'll cause that corn to be deformed and you know every let me just say every imperfection in our life everything in our lives that's unlike christ is a what deformity right it's still a deformity amen and that's the devil's business is to make deformed christians you know and how many knows that over uh we we sing songs about you know when you get over there there's not going to be anybody deformed everybody will be perfect there's you know and it's not going to be any hunchback there's not going to be any people limping and and so forth you know because perhaps they get in their wreck or whatever they're lame and lame or whatever they just limp along limb along limp along or whatever there's not going to be any of that over there amen and god is trying to get us as christians not to just slip along but to walk uprightly are you with me to walk as a man amen and brother ben we all know he said you know there's a lot of men that are 200 pounds you know of muscle and oh boy they're strong as ox but he said but yet they don't have one ounce of man in them so manhood you can only gauge manhood by the word of god nobody believes that not by somebody's philosophy or how smart they are how many degrees in college they have the only way that you can truly be a man is to have the characteristics that's in this bible amen used to be that a man was a man of his word and all you have to do is say i'm gonna do this and what did they do they shook hands on it that was their contract because their word was their bond folks i'm here to tell you i believe in being like that but i would not do that with nobody around today because i know what it's like to be in business not at what feels like the people have come back and say well you said this and that the other and you don't never remember saying that then what are you going to do then you got to do all that because he said you said because you really want to be a man of your word so you all got to yeah nowadays there's people that won't be honest that way so it's very hard other than the contract or to have it written down amen i remember i was in the contract with the guy one time and then and he says well you said you would do this over that this that and the other i says read on your contract look on the paper the money and now he says this money that you're giving me to do this it's only to build so much but just to build it no extra he went back and looked at me was all done it was all good amen but anyway so think about it you know and man how many knows man used to be man i mean when i think about world war ii when i think about those soldiers when i think about even the civil war huh you know i've heard about a man that was uh you know one was on one side the other was on the other side and so forth and you know there was bitter bitter a lot of bitterness and so forth but they had so much effect that when one of them was going to their funeral and so forth it was cold it's raining and they told this man don't go because you're you'll you'll catch your death or whatever you know if you do and he went went anyway to that funeral and ended up dying why he has that much respect for one another amen how many knows that we have are facing a serious dilemma amen because the devil has had 6 000 years to pervert and to deform and cause people not just to be incomplete but to go completely the other way i told my wife on the way to church you know if you want to see how deformed the world is look at these bodybuilders walking down through walmart in a little mini skirt tights on and uh makeup and look like a woman huh i don't advise anybody to watch it but i have on youtube people at walmart trust now some of y'all are laughing at you because you probably did and you find out real quick it's not something you really want to fill your mind with it's really bad folks yeah the way that people would rest to go to walmart you know it's just crazy it just shows you how perverted this world is how bad the devil is god god people all twisted up men and women alike and you know i had to think today i had to think of how that how that we we as a group here we're trying to uh not live below our god-given privileges are we we're trying to come up a little higher and live to where brother bam says we should live amen and not live down below all right our rights because you know because if you do amen it brings sadness it brings sorrow it brings depression if you're living way down there you don't have to live that way nobody here likes live a life of depression or fear or any of that and you don't have to or of uh uh you know of an area of your life that's not surrendered completely to your god we talk about being completely surrendered to god amen now we'll talk about completely being a man or a woman for the lord and you know i thought well we ought to we want to be we want to be the happiest people on the earth and i was thinking today i thought you know if we're the happiest people on the earth there's bound to go a lot more with that than just happiness right command if you've ever gotten to the place where you're the happiest place on the earth you have also got to have the most peace of anybody in there because you can't be right with god if you don't have the peace of god you know and so you've got the peace that passes all understanding how many knows you're gonna be full of something you'll be gonna be completely full of something amen and the bible wants you to experience fullness of joy you know there's a scripture here i mean go to it but he says that your joy may be full god wants his children happy he wants them to have joy unspeakable and full of glory peace that passes under that's full folks i mean completely full huh was it paul raider i guess it was when he was not he had so much the joy of the lord that was nothing to him you know and they come down there with the quartets and so forth and singing some slow gospel song it was a gospel song ain't nothing wrong with the gospel slow gospel song near my god maybe it was that one show you want me he said man get me some good give me some snappy i need there's not here he believed in happiness he believed enjoy yeah leave him being we'll stop he says she being sing me some snappy gospel song hold on she pulled back the shades and amen i'm going to a blissful let some gloom and spooky place i'm going where the angel says singing the second i take my lap breath i'll probably do a jig i'll probably dance ain't no telling i'm gonna be happy when i get over there so let's just start now so i'm snapping down at the cross where my savior died amen and he went out to meet the lord how many wants to go out that way if you go that way i'm hoping to go on the rapture but if i go that way i want to go to be like that fullness of joy fullness of peace god wants you to be completely full complete we are complete in him why do you think people do all the things they do to their body and do undress the way they do because they're not complete they're trying to satisfy trying to complain come to a place of satisfaction because that's what completion does when you feel complete with something you have all that you need you've got it hello and you're happy you're content [Music] amen so oh my now notice in ephesians let me just say he he typed it he talked about it paul talked about the ephesians that it's like god working on us like he's working and building a building in verse 10 of chapter two he says for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus and two good works which god hath before or day that we should walk in them let's go on down wherefore remember that ye being in times past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made with hands that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel strangers from the covenants of promise having no without god in the world here paul's talking about where we was at at one time and now but now in christ jesus you were sometimes a far off or made nigh by the blood of christ amen how many is close to christ now close to christ for he is our peace who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of petition between us amen having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances or to make himself of twain one new man so making peace amen oh my i got to stop you for just a minute is that all right i think the greatest thing ever that you can ever experience is whenever the battle between you and god is over amen because folks i'm here to tell you he you know he's your judge you're going to go off into a devil's hell unless you make peace with god unless you get unless you get to be at peace with god you're in a lot of trouble huh and if you ever have the peace that god gives you it's because he has what is he what he has ex you have been accepted as i think the scripture says you've been accepted in the beloved god says okay all right you repent i see the repentance is genuine i give you the baptism of the holy ghost i wash your sins away how many believe that the forgiveness of your sins god has christ has to forgive you you have to have that forgiveness before grace before peace ever comes in and folks i'm here to tell you if there's not there's unforgiveness there you won't be at peace you'll never have peace without other forgiveness how many knows that peace how many of those what that forgiveness is based upon that forgiveness is based upon whether you would forgive every man their trespasses you hold one thing against one person and god's going to hold it against you if you forgive not men their trespasses the bible neither will your heavenly father forgive you yours about that so it's based upon that you're not going to hold things against anybody else because god don't want a bunch of garbage up in here he don't want you with bitterness and all kinds of these other things that come along amen we got to be clean got to be right we'll get to that in a minute we talk about the flesh and and and the bible talks about the flesh and the spirit where we're going to supposed to be there as christians let's finish this so making peace that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him we had both have access by one spirit unto the father in other words the jews are gentiles whoever comes the right way now therefore ye no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god aren't you glad to be part of the household of god part of what god's building amen i'm more i'm a lot more happy about that than the fact that i'm a biler i've got brothers and sisters and i have our byler household but this gives me much greater joy to know that i must off the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth hello there'll be no more children but growing up how many god is building a house growth into an holy temple of the lord building up the temple building up the temple building up the temple of the lord how many believes that god is working you're the champions you are the temple of god god is working on your temple trying to get it just right so that he can inhabit every part of you growth into a holy temple of the lord in whom ye also are built up together for an habitation of god through the spirits praise the lord all right let's go to first peter if i don't go through these i won't get it done tonight so i'm gonna go to first peter if you will actually let's go to the fish back to ephesians first because we want to talk about paul describing us in perfection or completion as a soldier all right and now notice paula just got finished with everybody in their place right husbands wives sons children will be parents in the lord chapter six servants everybody everybody got to put in their place to where they would be able to conquer all the fiery darts of the wicked in other words he wants us to stand right stand as men and women that the devil can't touch um i wanted to start out with something but i don't know if i even i have it but it was in fundamental of our faith the prophet of god said you know the first thing friend there's some of you here that may not believe in divine healing you may not believe in the power of god first he says let me say this you first you were born here to control all circumstances how many beliefs god is as a son or a daughter of god and i believe it was billy paul that said he's seen the blind the deaf all be able to see and hear and all kinds of things he saw but the greatest miracle was how his dad could handle any situation huh how many words of people are like that lord help me to be able to control any circumstance that comes my way i'm so surrendered and completely in christ till i can commit that to christ and watch god work it out right and control all circumstances and he got that from the fact that adam was given power over all the earth right he was given authority over all the fish over all the animals he was supposed to be the ruler of the whole world even the winds the waves obey like jesus did how many knows jesus was that kind of man he controlled every circumstance it didn't matter if the ship was about the sink right the disciples said don't you care that we're about to perish brother glenn if i if i think i would hope that if i was on the boat i'd have told myself look if we go down he goes down so just chill right jesus in the boat so he may be sleeping down there but i'm here to tell you you know if we go down he goes down don't worry about it he's on and then don't you care what they wanted to try to say that he didn't care you know he cares you know and what was it oh ye of little faith right sit up on the braille on the sip and said peace [Music] peace still and it all became calm what did the disciples say behold i believe it is what manner of man is this that even the seas and the winds in the sea obey him amen god help us if we get to that place where we can control every circumstances people be saying the same thing what kind of man is he what kind of woman is he look at how they did in that situation look how they handled themselves look at what they did amen all right peter says it this way after all this he says finally coming to a conclusion right finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor not just part of it not halfway not incomplete don't leave some off but leave the take the whole armor on put it all on put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood against but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual weaknesses in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day boy oh boy talking about our day don't you i see this is an evil day evil day amen and having done all hello complete you've done everything you can do possibly do now having done all to stand now you're standing there stand therefore having your lawyers get about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen the gospel of i like the gospel of peace don't you hey do you realize you can be right of god you ain't got to worry about judgment and rather god you can have peace joy now everything that god has that's the gospel christ died for you so you can have all of that the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked let me ask you something what is a man going to do if he doesn't have faith in god the devil is going to have every dart come and hit him you don't go through jesus christ you're not going to be able to do anything right without me you can do nothing amen and so without that faith in god like the prophet god says anybody that ever amounted to hillary beings believed in jesus christ among to anything believed in christ jesus amen believed in the cross and what he did so that's the shield that's the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god amen praise the lord so many believe paul kind of gives a illustration there of perfection and completion and standing and being able to quench all the fiery darkness of the wicked being in a place to where the devil doesn't know what to do with you i laugh because you say that brother glenn say well the devil don't know what to do with me you better be ready tomorrow you better be ready tomorrow he'll come he's got a whole bag full of tricks oh he's got 6000 years of experience and you'd better you better get up off your uh your bed and drop down on your knees and say god make me aware of what the devil is going to throw at me today amen cause i'll make you prove it huh try being a preacher one time i'm preaching this stuff and watch what happens next day i try to put a doorknob on on a storm door everything goes everything raise the lord everything's good put a door little door handle on it right i ended up taking it off of the hole the whole thing down on the floor the whole door off of there taking it down and taking the door apart oh just to change your little face i'm like boy this day it's not going so well why because i bought a 30 dollar handle at the hardware right and it's got these little springs and this little thing that you go through the hole and push it in the other side and these big old clumsy fingers they're just not too dainty and we was trying to fit it in there just right and i pulled it back apart and the spring and the main pin fell inside of the door down here oh no i've never taken the storm door apart until the other day i know how to do it now if y'all need to fix it but that just takes some screw loose what goes together comes apart i figure you know but we got it praise the lord amen i wanted to i had a whole bunch of things to do right right like that and and that was one of my honey-do lists before i go to florida honey before you do that can you change that don't i all right we'll start with that and well then we're in half a day i only got to wednesday but anyway my point is if you take a stand watch out the devil's going to make you prove right and you think everything's supposed to go good it doesn't always all go good but that's okay how many knows god made it that way to try us you know he could have made everything easy if he wanted to but he knew that's not what we needed all right praise the lord you love him tonight so let's look at let's look at that paul saying this is what you do having done all to stand stand therefore well i don't know what you think about yourself but i'm 60 years old i think it's time for me not to be a boy anymore i think it's time to be a man i think it's time to be spiritually mature brother joe you know what else i thought brother steve when i thought about how that we ought to be the happiest people on the earth if you're the happiest people you also ought to be the most thankful person on the face of the earth the bible says and be ye thankful in all things give thanks you'll find that you know even over revelations and the giving of thanks you know they gave thanks you know had another holy ghost thought come to me that is if you're depressed and down just look at what the lords give you take a good look at what you got you got better than you deserve already you got bet you got it more than anybody you know anybody's ever had huh so if you're depressed and down start counting your blessings and i'll tell you y'all get happy real quick huh that's right it'll give you joy to know how good god's been for you not just spiritually but definitely that right but all the natural things that god's given you how good god is oh my let's not go there but anyway i just don't have much for a complainer do you i know god don't you know can i say just something else comes to mind we got the greatest nation ever other than outside of israel right we had should i say not have it's still it's still good but it's going down really really fast right and people don't they aren't happy with it huh the very politicians that are now that were nothing but you and i very poor not because of politics and everything that floods in because now they're multi-millionaires and they aren't even happy with it it's sad folks when you don't appreciate freedom you're not going to have it very long right well i appreciate the freedom god gave me and i plan on having it eons of time i'm sure you do too peter ii peter actually first peter very familiar scripture but it has to do with perfection completion being able to stand and not fall i shall not be i shall not be moved amir likes that song i shall not be no i shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by the water and she left that that's what we want how is that what you want to be this is the age folks to stand when all everybody around you falls stand verse 4 first peter 1 whereby are given unto us exceeding in great precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this give all diligence now what is this here this is coming to the stature of a complete or perfect man right add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge my my i have got to preach on that sometime again for the third time or fourth how many knows we have got to get our mind right we have got to have some knowledge i don't know if anybody could tell me what brother bannon said that knowledge was if i'm not wrong he said that knowledge is to be able to discern between right and wrong amen and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness one other thought that i felt like the holy spirit gave me if you're the happiest person in the world you're gonna be the kindest person in the world you're going to be the lovingest person in the world you're going to be the sweetest person in the world amen because you just simply can't be the happiest person in the world unless it's truly christ in you and that's what he is all of those be kind-hearted tender loving one another and forgiving one right you're gonna be all those things and to godliness brotherly kindness empty brotherly kindness charity amen how many knows the charity is the capping of it all amen nothing greater now there's hope faith and charity and the great of these is charity or love right and the brotherly kindness charity if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh the things is blind and cannot see a far off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the writer brethren give diligence to make your callings and elections sure listen to this next scripture if ye do thee things he shall never fall wow looks good to me don't you how many wants to be there be in a place where you never fall paul said having done all to stand do all of this gear up like this completely gear up peter says completely have all of these virtues you had all of these and if these things are in you they'll make you like jesus he controlled every circumstance never fell amen we're going to skip one where it says the old man the lust of the flesh and so forth you know all of the things that the flesh is and all of the deformity i mean those all of the deformity that the flesh is but you're not in the flesh but the fruit of the spirit is love dwight peace long suffering and so forth in that right so that's what he says you put that on put on these things let's go to jesus in in the last scripture i want to go to is in is the way that jesus looked at it what he said about perfection and it's in matthew 5. you know a scripture just comes to me also that i didn't write down but i think it's first corinthians 13 where paul talked about how that where there's knowledge it'll fail whether it's faith these other things he says and all these will come to where there's prophecies he says yeah but he says you know that love never fails not right how many remembers that genuine real genuine love it doesn't ever fail there's no fault in that perfect love i remember the prophet of god says you've got to have perfect love to get in there [Music] you can't come into this place without perfect love and he also said thus saith the lord it'll take perfect love to put you in there i mean believe we've got to come to that perfect love we'll go with chapter 5 and verse you have heard that it had been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you wow from what i understand if you can do this you're perfect now you forgive me if it's the wrong interpretation but let's read it a little further that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the sun to rise on the evil and on the good and send us reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you you're just like everybody else huh because that's all what they do and if you sleep your salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the and so be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect amen oh that's one of the hardest things i believe in life that it is to do and you know i find brothers and sisters if you remember just remember this but everybody says cancer you know sometimes you have a perfectly healthy body but a cancer comes up perhaps you had a wreck perhaps you become a bruise he says it can come from a bruise and then it'll grow and it'll get worse and worse and worse the bible talks about a root of bitterness when you un don't forgive somebody for something there's a root down there that abraham talked about that little hole you got to grub it out and that bitterness will grow because that root grows you got to get it all out that root of bitterness grow and grow and grow and it'll canker you it'll deform you you got to make sure you get that out of there there's not a rude bitterness even if they would kill you you would say like steven did isn't that right what did steven say he says after they stone him fixing the throw rocks at them forgive them but they don't know what to do don't lay this to their charge folks you in carnality you will remember what people did for the longest time you'll remember it for whatever for whatever you can't there's no possible way in your human natural ability to be able to do that don't lay that at their charge i forgive you all for this i know you're fixing to bash my head in with rocks but i forgive you for it and god don't lay it to their charge don't put it on no charge this is a no charge situation here even jesus not even they forgive them father for they know don't know what they do [Applause] come in those hatred bitterness and and all those things are blinding they blind you that's what jealousy they fought the fair they were jealous of jesus they hated him and it blinded them to what they actually did lord help us god bless you tonight stand with me if you will with our heads bowed how many wants to come to completion lord finish the work in me bring me that place i believe that person can come to that place i really do i'm trying to think but i'm i i could almost promise you that i've heard brother branham say that he had come to that place before he was completely surrendered to god completely yielded to god lord jesus usually the hands all over the building father it's your heart's desire it's what your prophets have said we need to come to it's what peter said that we need to build up our most holy faith the things that we need to add to our life so that we could never would never fall as long as these things are in us and abound lord jesus we come tonight humbly lord jesus reverently lord saying god here we are father not only completely surrender to you lord but we want you to build this building for a habitation of your holy spirit god so that you can completely fill us with the fullness of god with all of you every area of our life the measure of the stature the fullness of christ being each and every one lord and father didn't up to circumstances and situations coming our way they won't be as hard loving won't be hard to do forgiving won't be hard to do having peace will be a lord let the peace of god your word said rule in your hearts let's have joy unspeakable and full of glory let this church and the people here lord jesus come to that place to where god the devil can't rob them of their joy they can't he can't rob them of their peace can't rob them of the holy ghost because they have taken a stand they've taken on the full armor of god now they're standing lord i ask god now that you would help us to having done all to stand that we will stand now that we will be the same yesterday today and forever that we won't be changing and beasts what did paul say toss to and fro but lord that we will take a stand in you and the devil won't be knowing what to do with us we completely surrender yield and ask god that you just finish working on us lord help us to where we are our lives would be pleasing to you in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you love the lord beloved seeing that you look for a new heavens and earth and so such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless amen god bless you better david [Music]
