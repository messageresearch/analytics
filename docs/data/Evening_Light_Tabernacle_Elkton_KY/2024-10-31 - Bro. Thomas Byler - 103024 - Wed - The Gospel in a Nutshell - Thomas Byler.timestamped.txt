[14:11] brag on Jesus is it okay if we brag on
[14:13] him you know I I was just looking at the
[14:15] quote I know brother brandham somebody
[14:17] had said brother brandham uh you brag
[14:19] too much on Jesus he said what I don't
[14:23] brag enough about him you could never
[14:25] say too much in bragging about our lord
[14:26] Jesus cuz he's worthy of all pra
[14:30] so um just want to kind of update you
[14:32] with with what your efforts have went
[14:34] towards uh in the Carolinas and Johnson
[14:36] City area and brother Michael you know
[14:39] brother John and I took those uh
[14:40] generators up there uh last week on and
[14:44] took 53 so and and just to be honest
[14:47] brother Michael uh he wasn't there that
[14:50] day but he'd kind of conveyed to me and
[14:52] he said I I just don't know if we're
[14:54] going to need those or not and here
[14:57] we've just bought 53 generat
[15:00] and so and John he done got worried he
[15:03] we's coming home I I just feel bad I
[15:05] don't know if they're going to be used I
[15:07] said John don't worry about it the Lord
[15:08] wouldn't have laid it on your heart if
[15:10] they wasn't needed people wouldn't have
[15:13] give if it wasn't needed I said so don't
[15:16] don't worry about that they'll be used
[15:18] and then if you saw the post you saw
[15:20] that they they every one of them went
[15:22] out this week and they need more so
[15:24] every single one of them 50 50 well
[15:27] don't want to say every single one we
[15:28] had a couple that that turned up damage
[15:29] but we'll get those fixed and replaced
[15:31] and put back in circulation but all of
[15:34] ours and more went out to a place that
[15:37] they went to was 175 homes without power
[15:40] or
[15:41] electricity um without power listen to
[15:44] that without power or heat let's do it
[15:47] that way without power or heat U so I do

[15:58] generators cords went and so those
[16:01] people said we need every heater and
[16:03] every generator you got for our
[16:05] community so the Lord knew long before
[16:07] we did there don't do us any good to
[16:10] worry any any need to fret over over
[16:13] what the Lord lays on our heart just do
[16:14] it and let him take care of it so God's
[16:17] good I just want to kind of give you a

[45:32] to be in the house of the
[45:34] Lord amen I think this quote that I just
[45:37] printed out before coming out goes along
[45:40] with that with that quote so hang on
[45:43] everybody let me just read this people
[45:44] don't know what depressing times comes
[45:47] to this type of a Ministry brother Bram
[45:50] says I get real depressed and I said to
[45:53] the wife I wish could go on she says why
[45:56] do you say that bill
[45:57] oh I have troubles and things here I
[46:00] have troubles and things and then it
[46:02] seemed like the holy spirit said are you
[46:04] trying to bypass them are you trying to
[46:07] dodge them see no I said just let me
[46:10] stand right up in the face of all of it
[46:12] and face it out see it's so much better
[46:15] honestly truly I say this by
[46:18] eyewitnesses that just after this life
[46:20] is over we enter into a land that's
[46:23] beyond anything that anybody could think
[46:26] if there be any strangers here he saids
[46:28] I pray God that you'll not consider me a
[46:30] fanatic of anything I want to be honest
[46:33] and tell the truth what good would it do
[46:35] me if I was to tell something wrong when
[46:38] there's so much that's here that's the
[46:39] truth why would we have to tell anything
[46:42] wrong about it it's just a truth and no
[46:44] wonder I believe Paul was caught up into
[46:46] third heaven and he saw things that it
[46:48] wasn't expedient for him to speak of and
[46:51] one day he said Eye Has Not Seen Ear Has
[46:54] Not Heard nor has entered into the heart
[46:56] of man what God God has in store for
[46:58] them that love him oh it's just we're
[47:00] living in a dump pile down here just a
[47:03] rubbish sheap smoldering smoke of Filth
[47:07] even if we are not contaminated with it
[47:09] ourselves we are living in it where the
[47:11] smoke is just coming from smoking emils
[47:14] of of sin one of the most sickening
[47:17] things that I can think of is an old
[47:19] city dump of burning was you ever near
[47:21] one that horrible contaminated smell of
[47:23] smoke coming through all kinds of Filth
[47:26] and you get a breath of that and it just
[47:28] turns you around I remember having to go
[47:30] down to New Albany down when 8th street
[47:33] where the old used to be I have to
[47:35] collect down there for the electric
[47:37] meters and so forth I just dread it the
[47:39] day that I had to go down there when I
[47:41] had to take it down there because it was
[47:43] to smell that horrible smell yet laying
[47:46] out there was bodies of rats and dogs
[47:49] and everything you know and it was just
[47:51] smoldering and that old smoke coming up
[47:53] through and yet that life is compared
[47:59] to at its
[48:02] best just a
[48:04] smoldering sin smells from everywhere as
[48:08] it was spiritually speaking but oh the
[48:10] wind's just blowing free and everything
[48:12] else over there so lovely and peace and
[48:16] joy and eternal life just beyond the
[48:18] river but we're in a battle so let's
[48:20] just lay down and say let's hurry up and
[48:23] get over there let's bring everyone with
[48:25] us that we can bring
[48:27] amen that's about the truth isn't
[48:30] it amen you musicians thank you amen
[48:34] it's good to be back in the house of the
[48:36] Lord and amen I feel like I my if I was
[48:39] tell I guess it would show charg amen so
[48:44] recharge amen now if I won't be the
[48:46] Energizer Bunny tonight y'all will be
[48:48] all

[48:52] good to be in the house of the Lord
[48:54] always good to come together but you
[48:55] know I tell tell you what I think if you
[48:58] live here very long and and of course
[49:00] you know brother brandham going to
[49:01] hospitals all the time sick people all
[49:03] the time and the dealing with all the
[49:05] stuff that he had he realiz and I think
[49:07] we do realize that truly this is a low
[49:12] form of
[49:14] life it's a very low form of
[49:20] life this world Amen how many knows we
[49:23] are living in Satan's Eden where it's
[49:26] just sin on every hand people are so
[49:29] debauched until they don't even know
[49:31] what they are in amen and so it's a very
[49:35] very bad place to live and amen and we
[49:38] certainly know that there's a better
[49:40] land over Y and that's what we come out
[49:42] on a Wednesday night for amen amen to
[49:45] prepare ourselves for that land and to
[49:47] make sure that our soul will fit in amen
[49:51] into that place of Holiness and
[49:53] righteousness and peace and joy amen so
[49:56] we're preparing for it and you know if
[49:58] you're going to go into Rapture you have
[50:00] to have the Rapture Ready amen so that's
[50:04] what we come for amen let's just bow our
[50:05] heads kind heavenly father as we now
[50:08] approach your throne of grace once again
[50:10] coming into your house Gathering
[50:12] ourselves together according to your

[50:20] Speak Lord through my lips father the
[50:22] words of Life the things that you once
[50:24] spoken on this Wednesday night God we

[50:30] yesterday today and forever Lord and you
[50:32] will speak the hearts father you know
[50:34] the thoughts and intents of each one and
[50:36] what we all have need of and I pray God
[50:38] that when people hear the thing God that
[50:42] that your voice speaking to them that
[50:44] they'll respond and receive it and
[50:45] accept it and that we might be able to
[50:48] go from here being able to say did not
[50:50] our hearts burn within us as the Holy
[50:52] Spirit spoke to us on this Wednesday
[50:54] night along the way from God you are the

[51:12] hear father your word tonight Lord we
[51:14] appreciate each one God blessing upon
[51:16] the word now in Jesus name amen amen my
[51:20] thought is just kind of a uh uh
[51:24] different one I've just kind of been
[51:25] praying about what to speak on and and
[51:28] uh the the thought that came to my mind
[51:31] amen is the gospel in a
[51:34] nutshell amen the gospel
[51:39] nutshell amen and I thought well Lord
[51:42] that's kind of a strange subject amen
[51:44] that's kind of different amen because I
[51:46] know that when you go to talking about
[51:48] God well the nutshell had better be
[51:50] pretty
[51:53] big and how are you gonna put God in a
[51:55] nutshell right amen but it was kind of a
[51:58] figure of speech as you know when you're
[52:00] talking about a subject well that's what
[52:02] I'm trying to talk or say in a nutshell
[52:04] amen amen and so amen it certainly won't
[52:08] be just that but you know there is a
[52:10] plan that God has is that right and we
[52:12] so tonight we want to talk about we want
[52:13] to begin on that plan I thought you know
[52:16] it just depends on how how this goes but
[52:18] this might be a miniseries I certainly
[52:20] am praying that God will give me a good
[52:23] series amen maybe we should ask big
[52:25] should we ask B
[52:27] all right let's ask God maybe to give us
[52:29] a a long very long series amen I like
[52:33] those long series amen so if it's it's
[52:36] all winter it's all right with me amen
[52:39] because Fall's about over with here
[52:40] pretty soon so pretty soon it'll be
[52:42] winter amen and we just want to see what
[52:44] the Lord has but we're going to amen
[52:46] certainly go just on the first part as
[52:48] we talk about the plan of God Amen uh
[52:51] God and God's wisdom amen so if you have
[52:56] your Bible amen we'll turn to First
[53:00] Corinthians if you will 1
[53:05] Corinthians two First Corinthians
[53:14] 2 and I want to just review a little bit
[53:17] on Sunday yet before I get started but
[53:20] let's read chapter 2 and verse 6 but
[53:24] let's start with five that your faith
[53:26] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[53:29] but in the power of God amen amen how be
[53:33] it we speak wisdom among them that are
[53:36] perfect yet not the wisdom of this world
[53:39] nor of the princes of this world that
[53:41] come to not but we speak the wisdom of
[53:44] God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[53:48] which God ordained before the world unto
[53:50] our glory amen may God add His blessings
[53:53] to the reading of the word you can be
[53:55] seated
[53:57] amen I want to say Sunday morning I
[53:59] really enjoyed Brian's Sunday school
[54:01] lesson amen praise the Lord and you know
[54:03] I'm still well it just comes to me now
[54:06] but I'm still chewing on that amen amen
[54:09] still kind of eating on that because you
[54:10] know I like what he said you know he is
[54:13] he wants to make a strong finish amen
[54:17] how many believes it's a strong it's
[54:19] important to finish strong amen some
[54:22] folks many folks people start strong
[54:25] they have a strong strong start but a
[54:27] very weak
[54:28] finish amen amen and some
[54:33] people finish at
[54:36] all many are that way a't that right
[54:39] many don't finish at all amen and I like
[54:42] what he said he it's better start
[54:45] weak it's better to start weak you might
[54:49] say well that guy ain't never going to
[54:50] make it huh I just don't see how he's
[54:54] going to do it you know all the
[54:56] faltering all the fail all the doubt all
[54:58] the he's trying to you know struggle you
[55:00] know you might think that he's just
[55:02] starting weak but you know it's okay if
[55:05] he finishes strong amen I would rather
[55:08] do that than the opposite isin't that
[55:10] right amen and then brother Brad come
[55:12] along amen amen and I don't know about
[55:14] what you got out of it but what I really
[55:17] got out of it was amen that is that we
[55:20] are to keep
[55:23] walking keep walking on the King's
[55:25] Highway isn't that right if trouble keep
[55:30] walking amen how about you repeating
[55:32] after me I got wrote down here I want
[55:34] you to repeat you say keep walking
[55:36] sickness comes walk if troubles comes
[55:40] keep walk if Mama quits if Daddy quits
[55:45] if brother won't go if Sister won't go
[55:49] if Deacon won't go if preacher don't go
[55:53] keep on walking amen Give the Lord a
[55:55] hand that was good isin't that right
[55:57] that's right keep on walking just keep
[56:00] pressing on Amen because you know and a
[56:04] and a marathon you know if you get
[56:06] somebody in a marathon that just gives
[56:08] it all he's got right off to go get
[56:10] right watch out he's probably going to
[56:12] burn out now Marathon you got to pace
[56:15] yourself ain't that right about halfway
[56:18] through he'll be sitting on the side of
[56:19] the road huffing and
[56:21] puffing sitting there right I can't do
[56:24] it yeah why because he didn't Pace
[56:25] himself
[56:27] amen that's what you and I got to do is
[56:28] that right pace ourselves Amen brother
[56:31] Brian sister Jette we've been going this
[56:32] way now a lot of us here for 40 30 years
[56:36] now hello around 30 years you got to
[56:38] pace keep on pressing on Amen pace
[56:42] yourself

[56:47] fire we love people to run the aisle
[56:50] Shout Scream and holler and all of that
[56:52] and so forth you know but if after a
[56:54] while they're gone what good did it do
[56:57] I'd rather be a little more quiet amen
[56:59] and keep pressing the battle amen now I
[57:03] don't want you to be quiet but still you
[57:06] understand what I'm saying I want you to
[57:08] have a real anchor there it's not about
[57:10] your emotions amen I like something else
[57:12] but the Brad said he says you know just
[57:14] because troubles come don't lean On
[57:15] Emotion don't go by that emotion and
[57:17] that all of that don't go by that go by
[57:20] that down in Holy Spirit I'm pressing
[57:22] the battle amen so I appreciate that
[57:25] amen praise the Lord God is good so amen
[57:29] let's just look at God's plan for just a
[57:31] little bit and we going to talk about
[57:33] God's wisdom and his plan but uh and and
[57:37] amen let me just get Paul to explain it
[57:40] a little bit can I do that in Ephesians
[57:43] 3 Ephesians 3 and we'll begin with verse
[57:48] one for this cause I Paul the prisoner
[57:52] of Jesus Christ to you Gentiles if you
[57:55] have heard of the dispensation of the
[57:57] grace of God which is given unto me to
[58:00] you word how that by Revelation he made
[58:03] known unto me the
[58:05] mystery which I uh wrote a in a few
[58:10] words whereby when you read you may be
[58:13] may be that you may understand my
[58:15] knowledge in the mystery of
[58:18] Christ amen which in other Ages was not
[58:22] made known to the sons of men but it is
[58:25] now revealed unto His Holy proph
[58:28] Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that
[58:31] the Gentiles should be fellow Hees and
[58:34] of the same body and partakers of the
[58:38] his promise in Christ by the gospel amen
[58:43] verse eight unto me who am less than the
[58:45] least of the Saints is this Grace given
[58:48] that I should preach among the Gentiles
[58:50] The unsearchable Riches of
[58:54] Christ amen
[58:56] and to make all men to see what is the
[58:59] Fellowship of the mystery which from the
[59:02] beginning of the world has been hid in
[59:05] God who created All Things by Jesus
[59:08] Christ to the intent that now unto the
[59:12] principalities or principalities and
[59:14] powers in Heavenly places might be known
[59:18] by the church the manifold wisdom of
[59:23] God many times in brother br when he
[59:26] preaches the seals he talks about how
[59:28] that God has completely opened the
[59:30] Revelation the Revelation has been
[59:33] completely opened of God plan and what
[59:37] he had in his mind from the
[59:41] beginning amen and I like that word
[59:44] completely because if he says completely
[59:47] then we are understanding what the plan
[59:49] of God was so when we talk about a
[59:51] nutshell and we try to get comprehend
[59:54] amen what God's programmed what God's
[59:57] plan is the first thing we know is that
[59:59] for four Millennia for Millennia 4,000
[1:00:04] years man would have to wonder what it's
[1:00:08] all
[1:00:10] about what is life all
[1:00:14] about what's it all about us coming
[1:00:17] living and having uh making a living and
[1:00:20] raising our families and going by the
[1:00:22] way of our fathers and generation after
[1:00:25] generation would come amen and go and
[1:00:27] what is the real purpose and what in the
[1:00:30] world was God
[1:00:33] thinking Wars and troubles and
[1:00:35] pestilence and diseases and all the pain
[1:00:38] and the anguish the sorrow that comes
[1:00:40] with it is that right man was wondering
[1:00:44] what it was all about is this nutshell
[1:00:47] what is this all about the plan of God
[1:00:50] Paul said that it was a
[1:00:52] mystery in other ages it was not made on
[1:00:56] to
[1:01:00] man amen the manifold wisdom of God the
[1:01:04] manifold knowledge of God Amen until we
[1:01:08] come to the knowledge of the
[1:01:10] truth amen I'm going to use the word
[1:01:13] knowledge a lot and wisdom a
[1:01:15] lot amen because Mo most of the
[1:01:19] time amen we uh talk more of you know
[1:01:23] may perhaps talk a little of Faith a
[1:01:25] little bit
[1:01:27] but we want to talk about the the wisdom
[1:01:30] of God the knowledge of
[1:01:34] God because and the Mystery of God now
[1:01:37] so he says that these things have been a
[1:01:39] mystery for all of this time but now
[1:01:43] through the gospel through the uh uh let
[1:01:46] me see where it says of course through
[1:01:49] Paul but he says that they these places
[1:01:52] that it might be made known by the
[1:01:55] church
[1:01:56] so where is this going to be opened up
[1:01:58] where are we going to find this out at
[1:02:01] is the
[1:02:02] church the understanding of what it was
[1:02:04] all about cuz we're living in a world
[1:02:07] folks that don't know what it's all
[1:02:11] about they still live in
[1:02:16] ignorance they still don't have the
[1:02:18] wisdom of
[1:02:19] God they don't have the knowledge of
[1:02:23] God the knowledge of God
[1:02:27] is the
[1:02:29] truth
[1:02:32] amen and it
[1:02:34] corrects the
[1:02:36] wrong
[1:02:38] amen the knowledge of God tells you as a
[1:02:41] whole churches and so forth that you got
[1:02:43] to repent turn around you're going the
[1:02:47] wrong way amen turn around praise the
[1:02:52] Lord amen now how many knows that
[1:02:55] knowledge
[1:02:56] is power you heard the word knowledge is
[1:02:59] power and it truly is it truly is
[1:03:03] there's a lot of things that I've done
[1:03:05] later on I thought boy if I had just
[1:03:07] know this it had been so much easier it
[1:03:10] had been so much better I wish I would
[1:03:12] have just know that
[1:03:14] before it would make it a whole lot
[1:03:17] better I still do because how many knows
[1:03:21] it takes knowledge it takes
[1:03:23] understanding to be able to run a home
[1:03:25] to be a husband to be a wife to raise
[1:03:27] children to have a church to operate a
[1:03:30] church you need
[1:03:32] knowledge you need the wisdom of
[1:03:36] God in all these things because if you
[1:03:39] don't you're going to mess
[1:03:42] up
[1:03:44] amen and we say well look you know
[1:03:48] experience is so much better than
[1:03:50] knowledge
[1:03:52] no experience gives you knowledge
[1:03:56] we go to the school of heart knocks most
[1:03:59] of the time and then we can say you know
[1:04:01] I know what that's all about because I
[1:04:03] experienced it you got the knowledge of
[1:04:06] that because you experienced
[1:04:10] it so experience gives you
[1:04:14] knowledge it gives you wisdom it gives
[1:04:16] you
[1:04:20] understanding unfortunately we got to go

[1:04:48] peace amen okay so um this was in in

[1:04:58] again talks about this mystery that's
[1:04:59] been hid

[1:05:05] now in one uh place it talks about you
[1:05:08] know God takes the wisdom you know by
[1:05:11] wisdom man doesn't know God right we
[1:05:14] don't know God by wisdom and these other
[1:05:16] things yet yet Jesus said be wise as a
[1:05:20] serpent so he does want us to be wise
[1:05:23] worldly wisdom is what he's talking
[1:05:25] about Paul's talking about
[1:05:28] amen Ephesians 1 and verse4 as according
[1:05:31] as he has chosen Us in him before the
[1:05:34] foundation of the world that we should
[1:05:36] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:05:38] love having predestinated of the
[1:05:40] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:05:42] according to good PL pleasure of his
[1:05:45] will Amen to the praise of the glory of
[1:05:48] his grace whereing hath made us accepted

[1:05:57] riches of his grace wherein he has
[1:05:59] abounded towards us all wisdom and
[1:06:07] prence God has directed towards you all
[1:06:11] wisdom and
[1:06:14] Prudence
[1:06:17] amen so there is a Prudence that you
[1:06:19] might not want because God hides it from
[1:06:21] the wise and prudent reveals it to babes
[1:06:24] such as it learned but here
[1:06:26] Paul says he has also given you a wisdom
[1:06:29] and a
[1:06:30] Prudence amen how many believe
[1:06:33] that you ought to be smart as attack so
[1:06:36] to speak sharp as attack smart God wants
[1:06:39] you
[1:06:40] smart amen we know the phrase you can't
[1:06:44] fix
[1:06:47] stupid but I want to declare to you that
[1:06:50] that there's something that ignorance
[1:06:52] can be fixed
[1:06:55] ignorance cuz we know ignorance is just
[1:06:57] because you don't know something you're
[1:06:59] ignorant of it and so that's what we
[1:07:02] need fixed sometimes amen you can learn
[1:07:07] you can fix that ignorance God winked at
[1:07:10] the ignorance of Luther and Wesley and
[1:07:12] Pentecost he winked at it but when he
[1:07:15] come and he Vindicated the word you
[1:07:17] ain't ignorant no more you see now your
[1:07:20] sins open amen got rid of that ignorance
[1:07:24] he don't wink that ignorance and
[1:07:26] anymore
[1:07:28] amen praise the
[1:07:31] Lord that's right now
[1:07:37] notice wherein he has uh abounded
[1:07:39] towards us in all wisdom and Prudence
[1:07:42] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:07:47] his
[1:07:49] will woo I'm going just say it while it
[1:07:52] comes to me knowledge do you realize
[1:07:55] brother said when the bride
[1:07:58] knows when she knows who she
[1:08:03] is the rapture take
[1:08:07] place
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:11] wow she knows who she is but you know I
[1:08:14] wrote down on here I says you know but
[1:08:16] we better know a lot of whole lot of
[1:08:17] other St there's some bunch of stuff
[1:08:19] maybe we need to know amen before we
[1:08:22] even get to that God is trying to
[1:08:24] Enlighten us
[1:08:26] make known unto us the mystery of his
[1:08:28] will according to his good pleasure
[1:08:31] which he has purposed in
[1:08:33] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:08:36] fullness of the times he might gather
[1:08:38] together in one things all things in
[1:08:39] Christ which are in heaven and which are
[1:08:41] in Earth amen even in him down in verse
[1:08:47] 18 the eyes of
[1:08:50] your
[1:08:51] [Music]
[1:08:52] understanding amen
[1:08:57] how many believes there's a mechanism in
[1:08:59] your mind that God has to open
[1:09:03] up amen he that believeth on me amen
[1:09:08] shall not
[1:09:09] perish he that heareth my words amen and
[1:09:13] believeth on him me shall never perish
[1:09:15] the eyes of your understanding be
[1:09:17] enlightened that you may know what is
[1:09:19] the hope of his
[1:09:21] calling the riches of the glory of his
[1:09:24] inheritance in the same is and what is
[1:09:26] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:09:29] us where believe according to the power
[1:09:32] working of his mighty power when he
[1:09:34] wrought which he wrought in Christ when
[1:09:37] he raised him from the dead and set him
[1:09:39] at his own right hand in Heavenly
[1:09:43] places
[1:09:46] amen now in Colossians he's Paul tells
[1:09:49] the Ephesians folks this and it wasn't
[1:09:52] much different over in Colossians 1 and
[1:09:54] verse 25 where he says whereof I am made
[1:09:57] a minister according to the dispensation
[1:10:00] of God which is given unto me for for
[1:10:03] you to fulfill the word of God even the
[1:10:07] mystery which has been hid from ages and
[1:10:10] from generes but now it's made manifest
[1:10:14] to his Saints to whom God would make
[1:10:17] known what is the richest of the glory
[1:10:20] of this mystery among the Gentiles which
[1:10:23] is Christ in you the hope of
[1:10:27] glory amen so he's saying there once
[1:10:30] again that this has been a that it been
[1:10:32] hid from
[1:10:33] Generations it's the hidden
[1:10:36] wisdom
[1:10:39] amen praise the
[1:10:42] Lord according to EP I mean First
[1:10:47] Corinthians 2 and 7 says but we speak
[1:10:49] the wisdom of God in a mystery even the
[1:10:54] hidden wisdom wiom which God ordained
[1:10:57] before the
[1:10:59] world unto our
[1:11:04] Glory how many knows the world doesn't
[1:11:06] have this
[1:11:08] wisdom it says it says which none of the
[1:11:11] princes of this world knew for had they
[1:11:13] known it they would not have crucified
[1:11:15] the Lord Of Glory so that they don't get
[1:11:18] the wisdom how many believes it's
[1:11:20] important to receive the wisdom of
[1:11:23] God receive the wisdom of God otherwise
[1:11:29] you're going to be in the
[1:11:35] dark
[1:11:38] amen praise the
[1:11:49] Lord I'm not going to have near enough
[1:11:52] time and that's okay we don't expect to
[1:11:54] get through but I'd like to get she
[1:11:55] through some of the good stuff but uh
[1:11:58] let's go I'll just I'll just say this
[1:12:01] the world don't
[1:12:02] know first of all the world don't know
[1:12:07] who made the
[1:12:12] world they might think so or whatever
[1:12:17] but if you remember that atheist that
[1:12:18] went around the country and spreading
[1:12:20] his atheist doctrines everywhere
[1:12:22] remember brother Braham said he went out
[1:12:24] west one time on vacation and he went up
[1:12:26] into the mountain somewhere is that
[1:12:28] right he was going by these
[1:12:31] rocks these
[1:12:33] rocks and and something come over him
[1:12:37] something come over and said now where
[1:12:39] did they come from where did they come
[1:12:42] from they spoke so loud that he be
[1:12:44] Christian because he believed they had
[1:12:46] that had to come from
[1:12:48] somewhere Bible said one place you know
[1:12:50] if they don't believe the gospel or You
[1:12:51] Don't Preach he said the rocks will cry
[1:12:53] out God can preach the go gopel with a
[1:12:55] bunch of rocks it's when he speaks to
[1:12:57] Your Heart Right There amen so he didn't
[1:13:00] want to believe it people don't people
[1:13:03] don't want to believe the first
[1:13:05] commandment or the first scripture in
[1:13:07] the Bible in the beginning God created
[1:13:11] the heavens and the
[1:13:13] Earth if you can't believe that where
[1:13:15] are you going to
[1:13:17] go how dark is you're going to world
[1:13:19] going to
[1:13:20] be amen take the Bibles out of schools
[1:13:23] and teach them uh a Big Bang
[1:13:26] Theory right anything but to believe
[1:13:29] that but because if you really believe
[1:13:31] that the same as if you really get the
[1:13:34] knowledge of God and you hear that God
[1:13:37] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:13:38] begotten son if you believe that
[1:13:40] knowledge if you believe that with all
[1:13:43] of your heart the Bible says that you'll
[1:13:44] be saved you'll actually be saved if you
[1:13:48] genuinely believe that that whosoever
[1:13:52] believeth me shall not perish now
[1:13:54] there's some real know of God there's
[1:13:56] some real wisdom of God that if you
[1:13:59] accept that into your heart it's going
[1:14:01] to be a sweet thing for you
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:07] amen I'm going to say it because it
[1:14:09] comes to my mind but I've been thinking
[1:14:11] about this for the last few weeks
[1:14:13] there's so many people that say well I
[1:14:15] believe the cross I believe Jesus died
[1:14:16] on the cross
[1:14:18] amen and my question is why does the
[1:14:22] death of the cross mean so much more to
[1:14:25] us than it does most
[1:14:27] people why I'll tell you why is because
[1:14:31] we can truly believe that the whole
[1:14:34] world hinged and the great mystery of of
[1:14:36] of God was that he would come amen and
[1:14:39] that he would die on Calvary for your
[1:14:41] sins and he would redeem us back to
[1:14:44] himself amen it means so much more
[1:14:47] because you believe what Jesus is doing
[1:14:51] today if you believe that oh I believe
[1:14:54] what he did back then but you reject him
[1:14:57] today you Mar your testimony you Mar
[1:15:01] your experience it's not the same the
[1:15:05] story of the Cross means so much more to
[1:15:08] a Believer a real believer that believes
[1:15:10] it all than he that only believes part
[1:15:12] of it but won't accept what God is doing
[1:15:15] today because of his church or whatever
[1:15:17] it might
[1:15:18] be amen I hope somebody out there is
[1:15:20] listening to that that's right because
[1:15:23] you can't accept him of yesterday and
[1:15:25] deny him today and have the same
[1:15:27] feeling have the same consequences have
[1:15:30] the same rewards you got to believe all
[1:15:32] of him every bit of it amen and it just
[1:15:36] means so much it's such a reality that's
[1:15:39] why I believe that the preaching of the
[1:15:40] cross in the message you know it's so
[1:15:44] valid
[1:15:46] amen okay so speaking of wisdom let's
[1:15:48] talk about that for just a few minutes
[1:15:51] wisdom now how many knows that if you
[1:15:52] want to talk about wisdom you better go
[1:15:53] back and talk to solom a little bit Ain
[1:15:56] that right let's go talk to Solomon
[1:15:58] because he had a whole lot of
[1:16:00] wisdom amen the Proverbs of Solomon the
[1:16:04] son uh the son of David king of
[1:16:07] Israel to whom wisdom and
[1:16:12] instruction amen how many know that when
[1:16:16] you buy something and they give oh it's
[1:16:19] all complicated you don't know I have no
[1:16:22] idea you know just like brother Brian
[1:16:24] and and and looking at a schematics I
[1:16:28] guess is the word it's a little big for
[1:16:30] me but the schematics of the electral
[1:16:33] system and so forth and it's got all
[1:16:35] these lines and all of this other stuff
[1:16:37] folk you would never want Thomas berer
[1:16:40] to try to figure that
[1:16:43] out now now just too stupid yeah or or
[1:16:47] whatever you want to call it yeah too
[1:16:50] ignorant but let's let's say ignorant
[1:16:52] that's a better word don't know I learn
[1:16:55] it if I really studied I'm sure I
[1:16:56] probably could there's other things that
[1:16:58] I've done that I thought I've never
[1:17:00] could do you
[1:17:01] know but he knows just just how it is
[1:17:06] when you get something and and and read
[1:17:08] the
[1:17:10] instructions it gives you the knowledge
[1:17:13] to be able to put it
[1:17:16] together amen how many believes that
[1:17:18] that's what this is the Bible in the N
[1:17:21] shall you God's instruction manual
[1:17:27] man there's way too many people out
[1:17:29] there that are trying to do this without
[1:17:32] reading the
[1:17:36] instructions that's right they got the
[1:17:38] wheel on backwards they got this on
[1:17:41] backwards they put on all together and
[1:17:44] come to find out this part has to be put
[1:17:46] on first because you can't get it on if
[1:17:49] these other parts are put on and it's
[1:17:51] very aggravating tearing that thing all
[1:17:53] back down to put that one peace on so
[1:17:55] read the
[1:17:57] instructions that's the way with a
[1:17:59] Christian the whole bulk of it is that
[1:18:00] God wanted a family of his own here in
[1:18:02] and set forth the love of God brother
[1:18:04] bam said am mean if God wanted a family
[1:18:07] of his own fs and daughters like
[1:18:09] himself amen and he will chastise them
[1:18:12] and he will rebuke them and he'll give
[1:18:14] them troubles and all of those things
[1:18:16] are part of the nut a mean it's all a
[1:18:18] part of it amen so he'll chasen and
[1:18:20] sometime he'll thoroughly break him down
[1:18:24] how many knows you if a Christian and
[1:18:26] you still got this and you still got
[1:18:28] that amen yeah God can't put that all
[1:18:30] together he has to come and take you and
[1:18:32] thoroughly break you back down and start
[1:18:37] over I don't know about you but I don't
[1:18:39] want to be broke down and have to start
[1:18:41] over he's done that a few
[1:18:45] times I'm glad you never had to be broke
[1:18:48] down and Dead start would we got some
[1:18:49] time to do
[1:18:51] that amen instruction
[1:18:56] wisdom and
[1:19:01] instruction amen receive the
[1:19:03] instruction of
[1:19:06] wisdom Justice judgment and Equity to
[1:19:11] give
[1:19:12] subtility to the
[1:19:15] simple huh I many know that the serpent
[1:19:19] was the most subtile beast of the
[1:19:22] field and God said be wise is a
[1:19:27] serpent he wants you to be simple if
[1:19:30] you're a simple one God wants you to
[1:19:33] have
[1:19:35] some subtility thank you very much
[1:19:38] subtility about
[1:19:40] you
[1:19:42] Amen to the young man knowledge and
[1:19:47] discretion and wise man will hear it and
[1:19:51] will increase learning
[1:19:56] amen that's
[1:20:03] right in Matthew 28 he says go ye into
[1:20:06] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:20:07] Every Creature baptizing them in the
[1:20:09] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:20:10] them teaching them teaching
[1:20:15] them you learn something when you get
[1:20:18] taught teaching them to observe all
[1:20:22] things whatsoever I am have commanded
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:20:28] you
[1:20:30] amen that's right and a man of
[1:20:34] understanding shall attain unto wise
[1:20:37] counsels amen a smart man will listen to
[1:20:42] instruction a proud man is too proud I
[1:20:46] don't need it I already know
[1:20:48] it a smart man will want to learn
[1:20:53] more man man will be happy with what he
[1:20:56] has
[1:20:57] already hello so many people well I've
[1:21:00] got my religion I already know what I
[1:21:03] believe I don't Christ can't come in
[1:21:06] there
[1:21:06] anymore but a wise man will say what now
[1:21:10] tell me something
[1:21:11] more most of the time A wise man will
[1:21:14] listen and keep his mouth
[1:21:17] shut but a foolish man will do all
[1:21:20] talking and none of the listening
[1:21:26] amen praise the
[1:21:28] Lord attain to wise counsels verse seven
[1:21:32] Proverbs 1 and 7 says the fear of the
[1:21:35] Lord is the beginning of
[1:21:39] knowledge but fools despise wisdom and
[1:21:45] instruction I mean those fools
[1:21:49] also refuse
[1:21:52] repentance they refuse to be
[1:21:56] corrected so the fear of the Lord is the
[1:22:00] beginning of
[1:22:02] knowledge amen you open up your mind and
[1:22:05] know that there's a
[1:22:07] God and you reverence you begin to
[1:22:10] reference that God that's beginning of
[1:22:13] knowledge and
[1:22:18] wisdom
[1:22:21] amen they're stupid
[1:22:25] and then there's
[1:22:27] worse you know what what's worse than
[1:22:30] stupid a

[1:23:11] verse 13 He says let us hear the
[1:23:14] conclusion of the whole matter let's
[1:23:17] hear his whole shall fear God and keep
[1:23:21] his Commandments for this is the whole
[1:23:23] duty of man

[1:23:28] Lord amen all right I want to talk to
[1:23:32] you a little bit about something I've
[1:23:34] experienced and something the Lord's

[1:23:37] weeks through my deer hunting it's a
[1:23:39] deer hunting story so are you ready for

[1:29:42] growing TS getting young again amen and
[1:29:46] even in the last two three weeks I've
[1:29:48] told my wife I said I've noticed a
[1:29:49] change in myself that's right God is
[1:29:52] changing me a little bit at a time more
[1:29:54] patience and more dedicated to the Lord
[1:29:55] and just you know that's where I want to
[1:29:57] be
[1:29:58] amen anyway so that's right Thursday
[1:30:01] night was out amen and so that's right
[1:30:03] and went to the Ball Game and they ended
[1:30:05] up losing but anyway that was all right
[1:30:08] enjoyed my grandchildren you know
[1:30:09] enjoyed the game and all and then went
[1:30:11] out Friday there was nothing and then
[1:30:12] guess what Saturday night the Lord
[1:30:15] brought him in and I shot him that's
[1:30:18] right so praise the Lord so I thought
[1:30:20] you know that's God get put God first
[1:30:23] don't worry about it
[1:30:24] it doesn't matter just put God first
[1:30:26] whatever you do amen fear the lord
[1:30:29] reverence God
[1:30:31] Amen praise the
[1:30:34] Lord but fools despise instruction amen
[1:30:39] now this is kind of a different thing
[1:30:42] there I want to go to but let's look at
[1:30:43] what wisdom does and I think I'll go
[1:30:46] over
[1:30:48] to amen my son forget not my law but let
[1:30:52] thine heart keep
[1:30:54] my Commandments this just comes to mind
[1:30:58] I think I'm something that I felt like I
[1:31:00] missed on this on putting the Lord first
[1:31:03] it was when I was there in that tree and
[1:31:05] in that case I felt like I wasn't
[1:31:07] putting God first I got to think other
[1:31:10] things maybe that I was doing maybe that
[1:31:12] wasn't put in God first and then I
[1:31:14] wanted to tell you all I wonder if we
[1:31:17] don't do that more than what we
[1:31:19] realize I wonder sometimes if we do that
[1:31:22] more than what we realize because
[1:31:23] there's so many areas in our life that
[1:31:25] God has told us to do certain things a
[1:31:27] certain way and when you don't when you
[1:31:29] do something contrary to what the Bible
[1:31:31] says how many knows that you're putting
[1:31:34] him
[1:31:35] second amen put God first in everything
[1:31:39] all right now in verse 13 of Proverbs it
[1:31:43] says happy is the man that findeth
[1:31:46] wisdom the man that GTH
[1:31:51] understanding for the merchandise of it
[1:31:53] is is better than the merchandise of
[1:31:55] silver and the gain thereof than fine
[1:31:59] gold amen it's kind of like character
[1:32:03] that Peter talked about through the
[1:32:05] fiery furnace of Affliction he says
[1:32:08] there's a knowledge and experience and
[1:32:12] character that's molded that's much
[1:32:15] better than any gold that perishes it'll
[1:32:18] ever be true wisdom is worth more than
[1:32:21] gold and silver and diamonds
[1:32:26] amen think of all the people that are
[1:32:30] billionaires that don't get the real
[1:32:32] wisdom of God don't get the real
[1:32:34] understanding of their eyes being
[1:32:36] enlightened don't accept God's wisdom of
[1:32:40] accepting his grace for their lives
[1:32:43] amen

[1:33:25] though you have all of that wisdom and
[1:33:27] you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:30] there's a lot of times that God has to
[1:33:32] still teach you the things that he wants
[1:33:35] you to know you still have to be taught
[1:33:38] though you have the Holy Ghost and I
[1:33:40] think we can all say boy but the Lord is
[1:33:42] working hard and trying to teach me this
[1:33:44] trying to teach me that amen because he
[1:33:47] has to teach you the Holy Spirit teaches
[1:33:49] us things only that's right happy is

[1:38:40] what the world don't
[1:38:42] know because we're talking about now you
[1:38:44] know now you know how much better is
[1:38:48] when you can say now I

[1:38:57] know brother Braham says you can talk to
[1:39:00] people you can say something and and you
[1:39:03] know it's sometimes you're saying
[1:39:06] something complicated and all of a
[1:39:08] sudden everything you said just makes
[1:39:10] sense and falls together and you say oh
[1:39:13] I understand you catch it
[1:39:17] amen but I I wrote down here the world
[1:39:20] the things that the world don't know the
[1:39:21] world don't even believe Genesis was one
[1:39:25] that God created the heavens and the
[1:39:26] Earth they wanted to talk about a Big
[1:39:29] Bang Theory and they don't even
[1:39:33] know where we come
[1:39:37] from Darkness to not know where we come
[1:39:40] from trying to say that we evolve from a
[1:39:42] tadpole teach Evolution Darwin
[1:39:47] Theory you see how you can't have peace
[1:39:51] like that
[1:39:54] there's no power in being
[1:39:58] confused there no strength in it there's
[1:40:01] no virtue in
[1:40:02] it when it's all virtue when it's all
[1:40:07] strength when you do know who you
[1:40:10] are when you realize that you're a son
[1:40:13] and a daughter of God devil look
[1:40:18] out look out devil why because you
[1:40:22] recognize you're a son of God you're a
[1:40:24] daughter of God all of a sudden now the
[1:40:26] devil will become powerless to
[1:40:28] you
[1:40:31] amen amen praise the Lord don't know
[1:40:34] where they come
[1:40:35] from
[1:40:38] amen they don't understand how the
[1:40:40] creation and all of that that
[1:40:43] came
[1:40:44] amen they think the serpent was the
[1:40:47] snake perhaps but how many knows the
[1:40:50] snake didn't move its lips Now Eve you
[1:40:53] got to take a take a bite of this apple
[1:40:55] that's very very nice you know how they
[1:40:57] animate it and all how many knows the
[1:41:02] serpent it had been freaky
[1:41:06] hello it had been freaky if I'd have
[1:41:08] been balum and that donkey begin to talk
[1:41:10] to me yeah that donkey and that big lips
[1:41:13] I can't imagine what it was
[1:41:17] like but he blabbered he said you know
[1:41:20] I've served you all these years this
[1:41:21] other and the other is that right
[1:41:24] and he talked to him and so forth gkey
[1:41:26] can talk it's weird when an animal
[1:41:30] talks and God called this serpent the
[1:41:33] most subtle Beast he didn't call him
[1:41:36] human how many knows his serpent was a
[1:41:39] beast but he was also upright man we
[1:41:42] know that it was a missing
[1:41:45] link amen he was a missing link the
[1:41:48] world don't know that but you know
[1:41:51] that amen aren't you glad to to know
[1:41:54] what the serpent seed's all about the
[1:41:57] serpent that had a seed the serpent that
[1:42:00] beguiled Eve that's right he could
[1:42:04] talk and I think he had said he had his
[1:42:06] place for a soul but he didn't have a
[1:42:08] soul huh that's right so this Beast he
[1:42:12] was handsome from what brother Ram says
[1:42:14] he was good-look he was a good-look
[1:42:17] beast well let's call him a good-look
[1:42:20] monkey that was the best looking monkey
[1:42:23] in in the
[1:42:24] jungle cuz Eve was infatuated with
[1:42:28] him and this Beast could
[1:42:31] talk that would be weird wouldn't it
[1:42:33] brother Joe hear an animal talking but
[1:42:36] that's what he was he was a beast he
[1:42:38] wasn't human but yet he could talk I
[1:42:41] mean it's one of those mysteries in the
[1:42:43] nutshell the world understand doesn't
[1:42:46] know
[1:42:48] amen praise the Lord
[1:42:53] without God's knowledge without knowing
[1:42:56] where people come from what they're here
[1:42:59] for they don't know who they are even
[1:43:01] that's why you have the confusion that
[1:43:03] you have out there now not only do they
[1:43:06] not know where they come from but they
[1:43:08] don't even know for sure what they
[1:43:12] are gross on the
[1:43:16] people it's sad Brother Brad but we got
[1:43:20] to be glad that we can say hey I know
[1:43:22] I'm a man
[1:43:25] I am a
[1:43:27] man they ask one of our Supreme Court
[1:43:30] Justices what is a woman can you say
[1:43:32] what a woman
[1:43:33] is didn't even know what a woman was
[1:43:36] couldn't describe what a woman
[1:43:38] was yeah that's right would have been a
[1:43:41] real simple answer but that's on our
[1:43:43] Supreme Court of
[1:43:45] justices
[1:43:48] amen my what a shame not to know where
[1:43:51] you who you are be glad that you have
[1:43:54] parents to tell you what you are who you
[1:43:56] are amen slap you upside the head when
[1:43:59] you talk
[1:44:02] funny be appreciative at it
[1:44:05] amen with knowledge comes power how many
[1:44:08] knows when Thomas
[1:44:11] uh not Thomas Benjamin Franklin when he
[1:44:14] had put that kite out and he felt like
[1:44:16] there's a power
[1:44:18] somewhere there that there that there
[1:44:20] that lightning it's got power now I
[1:44:21] think he felt the did he feel the shock
[1:44:23] or something right or or put it in a
[1:44:26] bottle somewhere and he says and he felt
[1:44:27] and he says I got it I got it he was
[1:44:29] like boy there's a power surging through
[1:44:31] here but it wasn't until Thomas Edison I
[1:44:33] believe it was that did the light bulb
[1:44:35] right he come in and here worked and
[1:44:37] worked and worked and worked and work
[1:44:39] until he finally channeled that wo how
[1:44:42] you like how you like the light
[1:44:44] knowledge is
[1:44:46] power when they enel when they developed
[1:44:49] an engine they created the engine well
[1:44:52] guess what it wasn't long until you had
[1:44:53] a
[1:44:54] 454 uh 357 and all these powerful
[1:44:58] engines and Roar and everything else
[1:45:01] knowledge was
