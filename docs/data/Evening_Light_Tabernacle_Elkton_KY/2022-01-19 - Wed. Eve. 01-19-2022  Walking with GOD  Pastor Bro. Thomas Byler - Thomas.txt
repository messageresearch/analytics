mark white and he's a friend of mine we go back along many years ago and he lives in johnson city and he's up to where he's breathing up to eight hours a day on his own so they've got him off the that ventilator i guess and and so he's doing a lot better so we they just asked that we'd continue to remember him in prayer if you haven't eaten on your heart you might let it be known by the uplifted hand and grasp of the brine if he'd pray over the needs tonight amen jesus hold my hand page 222 38 oh as i travel through this view from land there is a friend who walks with me oh he leads me safely

know i'll meet you there amen praise the lord how many wants him holding your hand amen good evening god bless you amen i know that they've got some thank you musicians some ice warnings up out there and we checked the radar coming and it looks like it was supposed to start already so anyway it looks like it'll be a pretty good one so we'll get you out of here i mean before there you have to do like we did a few years ago i'll never forget now living in allegory and taking my car and just pushing it across the road so i could get in the ditch and go up the grass because that's the only traction he had is right along the edge amen so i think it was i think that was on a coming home from a wednesday night but anyway so a little bit more winter praise the lord amen it's going to be all sunny and the birds are going to be singing and amen be spring here in a couple couple months amen so amen praise the lord i was thinking of coming to church amen getting ready to come it was cold kind of you know and dark and rainy and i'm like well i'll tell you what it's a good sacrifice to make to the lord amen easy to go to church when the sun's shining the birds are singing everything's nice when it's cold dark winter you know then amen it's a better sacrifice to the lord amen but we'll try to keep get you i mean just go maybe 30 40 minutes 40 minutes maybe amen and then and then i checked to see if it was icing it isn't quite i couldn't tell that it was yet so amen we'll be all right but we're just glad to be back in the house of the lord amen i think you mentioned micah i know he's come down with something so let's remember him in prayer amen and all those that are certainly recovering from different things that's going around right now amen and so we do appreciate those i know i get on people for not coming to church but when you're sick that's where we want you to be just hang out amen because we don't want to spread this stuff anymore and we have to amen so we appreciate each one coming out tonight and those that are on radio land i'm going to have to find out just the proper word for that brother and on on the internet i guess well well it's not facebook but anyway online all right goes online god bless you amen uh all the different names we could name amen especially our elderly amen and so amen we don't mind those that are sick and and and those that can't come to watch but we do want everybody to come that possibly can amen so let's just bow our heads go before the lord in prayer kind heavenly father we come before you lord jesus we're thankful lord jesus to know you lord and we just come here father to search our hearts lord to see where we are with you lord as job said lord to present ourselves before your lord and see lord jesus where you need to work on us and what we need to change father to become a better people for serving lord and we ask god that you just touched mike the lord in a special way father i know he's just calmed down sick this morning and we ask god for healing for him lord jesus and the different ones mentioned and lord we ask god most of all that you'll come in a special way and give us the inspiration to speak your word that we need to hear father that would draw us closer to you lord jesus and lord i feel like you've laid this on my heart about a week ago lord jesus and you just kind of stayed there and i believe that's just what you want me to speak on tonight so we ask god that you just help us lord to minister you to your people and to edify the body of jesus christ tonight lord we love you and we appreciate your father in jesus christ's name we ask these blessings amen turn your bibles if you will to hebrews the 11th chapter and i want to speak on something that each and every one of us amen desire amen is that all right i would hope so anyway i believe that each and every one of us has a desire for what we're going to speak about amen and uh so i believe it certainly applies to us it applies to the time that we're living in today that we're living in amen and i believe it is very timely amen i appreciate danny's message and i'll tell you what i believe there's a lot in there and i i kind of this kind of derived from what he had talked about i got to thinking about the things that he had said so much until i got a message in my own amen so amen i i just love it amen so praise the lord hebrews 11 and we'll begin with or just read one one verse well let's read both of these verses 5 and 6 hebrews 11 5 and 6. by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen i wasn't going to read this but i think i will it just comes to mind let's turn to ii thessalonians amen 2 thessalonians [Applause] 1st thessalonians first thessalonians 4. verse 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first amen praise the lord now i hope that everybody can believe and find yourself in this verse right here then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord amen may god had this blessing reading of the word you can be seated amen tonight i want to speak on a closer wall amen amen so how many believes that that's the desire of everybody here tonight is to have a closer walk with god i didn't bother looking it up but i do remember brother branham saying to an older couple in their 80s i believe it was you mentioned you look at this brother he says and if i would ask them if what they would desire he says you know they would say no doubt would be a closer walk with god so even when we are if i get to be 80 years old it'll still be a desire that i have no matter how old we get we always desire a close walk how many knows we can get closer to god we certainly can amen and we're trying by the help of the lord to do that every day and uh scientifically uh we we get we're getting closer to the lord's all the time amen as far as time wise is that right you know i mean let's just say you know he's going to come in 2023 and august the 23rd right 220 2023 this is what 2022 already hard to believe in it we're way down this road and you know the thing that jesus said about it is that he's going to come in a time when people don't think he's coming right he'll come in the unexpected time for people that are not watching for him i don't believe he'll come an unexpected time for people that are watching and waiting amen and the other aspect let me just bring the other point of this out this other point of this is is you know to actually believe that you'll escape perhaps by the grace of god those that make the rapture will actually escape where god says that day you will surely die amen how many knows death is really sure for humanity there's only a very few that have not tasted death right a very few that have not tasted death elijah was random right who was the other one enoch and inaudible those two that i know of there may be another one that's all i can think of right now amen but just two people and then those that are in our age you and i believe that we're going to be amongst those is that right you actually not have to taste of that not have to go through that struggle right you know and i'll i'll never forget whenever i watch brother ivan pass away was right there with him by his side and amen if i think it was 12 o'clock somewhere in there and if i'd have known this that close to death i'd never come back home that night but anyway whether william called me and said he was pretty close i came right back up that night but you know the struggle the the struggle that you go through the the pain so to speak and and and death struggle and i was like well you know all of life ain't so bad but when it comes to death this is the worst part because you never know how you're gonna go you don't know if you're gonna be blowed up but you don't know and uh you know if you're gonna some of them blow up you know perhaps because the little liver don't work at this side or the other like but ivan did others we've watched until they become skin and bones until there's just a skeleton there and they'd finally die you know and it's that struggle and so forth and you know we hope by the grace of god that god will have mercy on us that perhaps we'll escape that amen we'll not have to go through that because we know the scripture tells us that there is a people that's going to be alive and remain right until the coming of the lord and every hour every year every month every week every hour and every time the clock ticks you're gonna you're getting closer to god amen everybody is everybody is because how many knows everybody has an appointment with jesus everybody has an appointment with him wouldn't he like that shout that up in the white house and all those unbelievers hey everyone got an appointment with jesus whether you like it or not you're gonna meet jesus revelation 1 says every eye shall behold him every knee shall bow every tongue will confess to jesus christ everybody's going to have a time it's just that by god's grace we plan on meeting him first there's those who meet him sooner and there's those who meet me later now we know that those who are not in christ don't go in the rapture aren't a part of the bride of christ that general first resurrection we know that they wait in a nightmare for a thousand years now right because the bible says the rest of the dead live not until the thousand years are expired amen and then after that comes the white throne judgment death hell the sea the grave everything it all gave up instead they all come and stand before the judgment of god my so they have an appointment but i'll tell you what there's a glorious appointment and that's for those who are waiting for him even jesus said blessed are those who see him and wait for him and pray watch and pray amen it'll be a blessed thankful that i'm watching you know i was thinking how many times the bible tells us that blessed is he whose mind is stayed on thee and then he hit on that talking about we've got so much time for everything else huh and you know no matter how much we work now how much you know and on monday i think it was the next day i thought lord you know i want to practice what the preacher preached you know i i don't i want to be a doer of the word and not just a hearer how can i constantly have my mind on with me how can i meditate on thee day and night and i had about five six different places i had to go i had to go to bed i had to come back here you know because i have such a good memory i love my good memory you know and i thought you know i got to go down to the church and i got to get my phone because i left it down there because i forgot to bring it along i'm really good at remembering what i forgot anyway that says you know but i'm gonna drive from russellville to here and then i just focus on the lord let me think about the lord well what in the world are you gonna think about all this well how can you keep your mind stayed on him all the time and but you know when i go in there i'm gonna have to get my mind off the lord i'm gonna have to think about where my phone is and after that i gotta go to tw you gotta do this at the other now i'm going to have to do business you know in between each time lord help me to just keep focused keep thinking about the lord you know by by the end of the day we did all kinds of things went back home and says you know we're looking for flooring for to put flooring down in our new addition and everything and we had gotten some up here in town here and a guy went home and it just didn't match my wife was happy with it but i wasn't happy with it and that's rare you know when you're not happy with what your wife is happy with but anyway and i just not writing so we said let's go to bowling green and and we went off the bowling green and we'll go head over there come to the light there and i said you know tommy's dad's got a store down there you know i think i'll just stop there and see what he's got but before we went there i believe we went through derrick through burger king you know and went through burger king and uh you know and got some food and so forth and and uh you know tried to keep thinking about the lord and and here i get ahead of myself but you know there's you'd be amazed if david was testimony david said something about he would meditate on god's testimonies right so if you want to know what there is to think about there's millions of things to think about i don't care if it's david and wife you know but i might what come to my mind we'll get back to burger king in a minute but what come to my mind was hattie wright lord i think i got to think about god's testimony had it right you know she had no doubt she thought on the lord no that she had to walk with the lord amen when god brother man talked about those squirrels that were created you know that he spoke into exists and and so forth and he said that ain't nothing but the truth i mean she said the right word because her mind was in the right place if our mind was in the right place right and then then we would say the right word and as a result of the saying the right word we will receive a reward good things come to those who say the right thing i mean i was a little we could all use a little help and saying the right thing and you'll do the right thing to say the right thing if you meditate on the right thing if you think about the right thing amen but that was just thinking about lord thank you for everything and and so that you know we went there and we got up to the door and we had our of course we took our weimar and her dog along and and you know he was up there and that young man in there says oh what a beautiful dog what a beautiful that's a really nice oh i said you don't have a pup cup for him you know every single time he goes or die or dairy queen we got to get them a pup cup and anyway he said no i don't but i'll get you a little cup yeah i'll get you a little right that dude you know and uh i said all right well we had done went up there up to the front window and i said how much he said i forget it and i'm just well thank you for the free ice cream that's hey how about getting me one charge me one would you he says i'll just get you one two because i got two free ice creams i said well thank you lord thanks for really going good here yeah i thought about it you know what are you thinking about the lord you never know what god's gonna do something good amen how many how many remembers but abraham told them the story when the atmosphere of the holy spirit come down in the car i think brother biscuit was with him right amen and i don't know if there was a moose or whatever elk or something there and he says every time he comes something good always happened how many believes that in your life that when he comes there's always something good that happens amen so i like that it's just it's just awesome how many knows i believe we could all use less i believe we could all use a closer walk because what a closer walk is is deeper fellowship with him i believe that close your fellowship with him how many could use more fellowship a closer fellowship another like adam had fellowship with him eve had fellowship with him before the fall [Music] amen how many know the prophet says we have the right to have the same fellowship they had before the fall oh my i'm just going to say this before i go on our little road trip but you know i i got to thinking about how that god worked on the prophet right and god is working on you and me god didn't trust brother branham was just tell that young couple whatever you want and it'll happen to him you know what that is that is absolute power how many knows he said cease to exist those folks would have vanished whatever he said would have happened because that voice that he heard that wasn't no bluff that wasn't the devil that was god telling him say what you want huh but god had rather brought brother brown into such a walk with him until he could trust him with absolute power oh my how about that tonight how am i doing that challenge is to say lord can you trust me have i got the kind of character that if i was presented with that situation i have such a close walk with god i am so much like christ until i will say the right thing and not the wrong thing huh because i believe that's where you got to be before god's going to give you that kind of power power power without character is satanic and he's not going to have you run around devilish now he's going to have you run around godly and and this is one thing that we're that i've learned in life and that is that you have each and one of us here and everywhere you have to ask yourself of one serious question and that is how am i really because i'm here to tell you there's a lot of christians a lot of folks that think there's so much away and they still got a lot of things in them that is not good huh when you take a good look at yourself you'll see those things the holy spirit will show you those things that are not good no that's right he does me i hope he does you that's not good this is not good you know because people just think they're better than what they really are most of the time and unless you take a good look but god is real god is working on us and getting us closer to him so anyway so then we went over after the after the you know the it's a free ice cream went over to the store down there and and we was looking at something the match and i wanted a thicker grade i wanted a six on an eight or ten millimeter thick rubber you know planking and so forth and and and all i had was a five and it was so skinny i said man i'm gonna walk on that twice as much as i was gonna unsnap real quick like and i can't have that i want something thicker you know but anyway we found the color that we liked and we came here which was over there and it says oh i like that color right there and i was like i don't really like it and she flipped over page and we brought a tile along that we're trying to match the floor up with it well in the second page he was twice as good as the one i was looking at and sure enough you know i mean it was like so many thousand dollars i thought well this is gonna be a bunch of thousand dollars for this thick stuff this high quality 35 year warranty and all this other stuff you know and then when he told us the price well that's what we're giving for the thin stuff well praise be the guy we found our flooring didn't have to go all the way to bowling green this is that's just how god works thank you jesus amen how he believes that things just go so much better not that they can't go bad amen but still if you're walking with god it's okay i mean how many loves the lord so praise the lord god is good and you can imagine you know you have to just ask yourself the question what kind of a man what was it that about enoch that caused him to please god and that god would actually translate him now the bible also says that noah walked with god in genesis 6 i think it is somewhere there i've got to wrote down here we won't go to it but he not with god noah walk with god moses no doubt walk with god there's many men that walk with god but in enoch please god that's the one thing that he did how many knows it's not about pleasing the pastor it's not about pleasing your wife your husband or anybody else it's about pleasing god all those other things will take their place if your heart's desire is to please god he so pleased god until god changed him in the atoms and you and i are living in the age welcome the lord could come many times so that's going to be our question is are you so pleasing to god that he's gonna change your mortal body that's a good question isn't it i thought lord i don't see any way that we're gonna be pleasing to him unless we truly have our mind stayed on him until we have our focus on god because i'll tell you what we can how many knows we can get so busy with work until our mind is on work so much huh that we actually blackslide work or anything else it can be on something else but mostly you know because i don't know about you but i i'm a workaholic i like to work you can tell well i don't know if my hands show it or not but usually a man's hand shows whether he loves to work or not love the work most of us do right we've learned to but sometimes we get so busy until we don't have our mind on the lord like we should amen but no doubt and i think this is so true folks that it is i'll just this is a statement i wanted to make from that thought was that it is more important that we that we spend time with god than it is that we work as much as what we do so i'm at the place i'm at the place lord if i'm going to have a closer walk with you then get lord help me to slow down help me to cut some things out of my life to where i have more time for god and even if i get so busy that i've got 10 different things i got to do in a day like i said when i get here look i want to get my mind right back on you lord right back on you right back on you after each one keep in mind stayed on you amen help me to keep meditating on him day and night so i'm going to ask you another question since we've heard that we believe it was of the lord that a man that's going to be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water he's the kind of man that meditates on his law and his and his delight is upon him day and night has it changed have you changed any have you made any changes or was that just a nice little message we heard i thought you know i preach about well let's not just be hears of the word but doers of the word it's a whole lot better to live as herman and lord help me do this i don't want to just think about it or have it go through my mind it's not just a good thought it's something that we have to apply to our lives that everything that we think about as much as possible now how many knows you got to take care of your family sure you got to take care of your family you can't be uh worse than the infidel uh because even in paul's day they that people you know got so spiritual so to speak they didn't even work and paul had to say look if a man don't work then he shouldn't need that's right you gotta take you gotta keep your balance on things but still our heart and our minds is on him elijah how many knows that elijah must have pleased god amen elijah was so close to god until what horses and chariot came and picked him up huh what was it the prophet said about flying saucers didn't he say it's one of these days one of them things to come down and pick you up he called it investigating angels didn't he he said those are investigating angels and we've heard not so long ago i heard the government talking about people are seeing stuff people are seeing stuff now i know if they keep it quiet or what but i wouldn't be one bit surprised we need to there's a whole lot of public investigating on going on there's probably angels coming and visiting all the time and saying is it as bad as what we're hearing here huh they're finding out yeah it's worse it's getting so bad amen you know i want to say this that it's getting so bad and living in this world is so bad until you have to actually shut your mind off of it if you was to think about it all time and focus on it all the time you'd be depressed i'd be depressed if i got to thinking about how how terrible it is and that's why the keeping up with politics and all that knowing everything that goes on that doesn't really benefit you a whole lot it really don't lift you up amen because why it's all bad why is it that people love bad news rather than good news they meant this place probably be full of everybody like good news amen but think about elijah how a chariot came up he walked so close to god until a chariot amen come down and pick them up and took him to heaven that's what you and i are believing that god's going to do for me and you but we have to come to that place where god can do it right i think brother bam says you know that before uh the andaluvian destruction people had to get into the spirit of that destruction they had to get in the spirit of wickedness and lewdness and so forth amen because what their minds was only evil the bible says continuously continuously evil but that's not where our mind is supposed to be in philippians 4 and 8 i want to do something that i kind of picked off of what brother bad had brought about what was it the devil's beatitudes i want to i want to take this and i wrote this on the back of my note here and i'll read it to you but god wants us to think about good things finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely i think i missed that one whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things you know and i don't think the devil calls him brethren i was just going to say the devil says to his children finally children whatsoever things are deceptive and false whatsoever things are dishonest cheating and lying and stealing whatsoever things are unjust whatsoever things are impure and vile whatever is a bad report whatever is very unlovely if there be any not virtue which is strength but if there be any weakness if there be anything to complain about instead of praise huh if there be any praise because that's when you are thankful for something and and you praise somebody for something you know but it is if there be anything to complain about or to talk about to murmur about think about these things that's what the devil says because he certainly did the eve didn't he he got to think about a little white lie 99 truth but it was still a lie korah remember the devil come to core and told him you know moses he's such a big shot you know and and there's a whole lot more holy people than just him god uses us too you know huh it was a devil's side wasn't god's thought never got into cora's mind and what did he do he polluted him corrupted him amen how many beliefs of mind is the womb to the soul i believe we have to protect this right here amen what did paul say he says bringing every thought captive to the word of god because the second you open up the channel of your mind huh but says before a man will cheat on his wife wife on earth it first happens in the air you open up the thought first once that thought comes in and you accept that thought say i'd like that or i want to do that that's the first thing you think before it ever happens then all the rest takes place after that amen before you have to you think on anything impure you have to override that conscience and say you know the conscience says i throw that away amen don't open the door amen he did to israel he did decorah he did the eve amen got them all to do things they shouldn't do amen think about paul paul how many knows he walked close to god amen it wasn't time for a rapture because i believe if there's anybody time anybody that would have been ready to go it would have been paul how many knows that if you lived in any other age any other age down there you had no you had no promise of a rapture that's now what i mean by that is a physical rapture from hero now we know that there's a they got a rapture coming they're going to be caught up aiming in the air just like we are i mean that means to be caught up is a rapture but we which ivan remained we have a promise in this hour that at the time of his coming amen that's when there's a promise of a rapture those that are still alive why because god's not going to wait until you spend your another 25 30 years our little children or we're not going to wait till they are 70 at their appointed time no god's going to say time's up that last number that last name is redeemed and those that are still here here alive he says i'll just translate them and we'll all go up folks if that don't make you happy if that don't make you happy to think that hey you have that promise that's our promise that just one of these days you're going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump amen will be changed i don't know i don't remember just exactly what the prophet said you'll feel a sharp pain did he say or like if some kind of a feeling will come over you something will happen and just all of a sudden huh you'll be back to young again back to 20 years old but folks i'm here to tell you it won't happen if you're not walking with god if you don't have a close walk with god my heart's desire tonight is lord i came to church people listening why because you desire a closer walk with him a closer walk with him and i think brother danny brought it out we all know that brother brown says if you want to get closer to god there's only one way what does he say read more and pray more right that's reading his word and fellowshipping him with him on a greater scale than what you are now it cannot you can never i don't believe you can ever become a better christian unless that changes you have a closer walk with him that you think about him more that you meditate on you read the bible more how many knows if you really know if somebody is walking close to the lord it'll be because they walk close to his word this word means everything to you because this is god amen so lord help us to have a close walk with him to let him look down in your heart look down in my heart and see if there's any wicked way in there yet and if there is lord take it out if there's any character that we have that's not supposed to be there lord take it out lord take it out amen and the closer you get the more it'll be like that the amen to the lord will show you where those areas are and we know our prophet was a real good example everything he did was right amen so paul again what he called himself what did he call himself he called himself paul christ he was a prisoner chained had love chains on him he had suffered the lust of loss of all things that right and he was a prisoner for the sake of christ amen his joy his happiness in this life was when he would come to a church and see how it would have progressed that right they were the joy in his crown they were the joy of his life the jewels amen that's what it was he walked with god he stripped himself of himself i believe that's what we got to do strip ourselves of ourselves anything that is yourself amen i got to thinking now maybe just kind of come to close with this but i got to thinking of the things that we've lost huh the things that we've lost over the years like brotherly kindness like brother brown says used to go help a neighbor if he got sick and so forth and go help him and so forth hardly ever you know and you know we don't know a neighbor is dead until you know we see it in the newspaper or whatever uh friendship how many says he believes in so many things are gone he says we're at the end of child raising family life is almost over church life he said it's gone almost you just about can't get people to come to church anyway just about gone people just don't care about god anymore huh uh marriage is almost gone friendship is almost gone amen we used to how many know we people ago used to visit each other right we don't hardly do that anymore do we reach us about don't don't go visit each other anymore why you got face time you don't know what somebody's up to is go to their facebook you lay there on the bed or on your couch and say well so-and-so did this that or the other oh they're on vacation down there in florida they're over here and doing this and that that's the only fellowship we got is facebook i guess my wife watches it a little bit and she's into that more than what i am but anyway but to actually go and visit somebody and friend be with some friend or a brother or sister and i thought you know maybe i should preach on that sometime and see if we can't get some of that back amen get some of the things back but we got to start i mean believe we got to start with ourself get back with god the way we're supposed to be and then a real good relationship with our husbands wives and have a good family relationship and let it bleed over into the neighbors and to your brothers and sisters and just let it flow out because we don't have to lose those things i mean believe that we gotta lose them things they're still hours for the most part it's just that what we've lost the biggest thing that we have lost is time we just don't have time we're so busy the other night i work till 8 30. you know i got my flooring in it eight and i was trying i'm trying to get that thing place finished i'm about done with that by the way and so that's gonna be a relief for me because i'm gonna have a little more time maybe but anyway we did a 20 by 30 edition and we got the inside almost all done except for the baseboard tomorrow and and within three months so i've pushed it pretty hard last three months to try to get that done and so but i got to thinking you know lord help us where's our love where's our peace where's our compassion our brotherly kindness huh brother branham even talked about how that and i do it uh we all do it right whenever we see somebody that we know we go well not when his wife did that to somebody he says what you go just all you're going to do is give him a silly nod you say hello there or something and so forth brother and you know let me say something else i believe when a person has the holy spirit the way they should you can live life to the fullest huh everything has more meaning there's if people don't have any feeling then the bible say people will be without natural affection people are so cold-hearted until this you don't have any feelings anymore and brother branham he was close to god he had that all of that is is there and many good feelings and when you because i'll tell you what right now i i don't think there is a mortal i don't think any of us that can say well i just don't care how i feel yeah we all care about how we feel now we don't always feel good and it's at those times that we have to kind of say well it doesn't matter how bad i feel i'm going to rejoice in the lord anyway right but we all like to feel good absolutely we love to feel good and that's what the holy spirit is there for they give you peace that passes understanding joy unspeakable and full of glory people used to have so much of the joy of the lord brother john they'd run from one top of them pews to the others but let me tell you something you better not run these fuse because these will tip backwards real quick i found out you'll probably be knocking them all down we would have to fasten them to the floor for you to run on these pews well especially if you're fat like me anyway people used to have joy people lost their joy amen and how do we get any of these things back by meditating on the lord more by dedicating ourselves to god enoch i don't think i brought it and i think i have it in my book but uh in the greek lexicon it talks about enochs in the name the name enoch meaning dedication dedicated i believe that's why we got to be more it's more dedicated to the lord jesus christ any walk that has fellowship and communion with him god bless you stand with tonight if you will hey i didn't think about it but that was exactly for that's all right how many loves the lord amen how many knows that you have a desire that i want to be closer than what i am i want to be closer to the lord a closer walk with him lord jesus you see our hands tonight they're all raised lord saying father we really want desire father a closer walk with you lord and father we ask god that you would grant us just that closer walk father by lord helping us to die to ourselves and not let other things to have the preeminence lord jesus but let your word have the preeminence in our hearts and in our life let your holy spirit rule and reign in our lives lord we thank you father that we can have that we thank you lord jesus and whenever we're driving down the road whenever we're at work wherever we are we can be so in you lord and so saturated in you father and lord until sometimes we can't help ourselves we just kind of got to sing a song make a melody in our hearts singing praise to you lord jesus lord jesus help us to be that way father just the way that the scripture has said lord singing songs and making a melody in our hearts unto god because of the sweetness that we have as we walk with you in jesus name we ask it amen and amen turn your song books i want to sing one before i turn to brother david i mean let's sing just a closer walk with him 124 amen how many knows out of weakness is where the lord is strong amen 124 i am weak but thou art strong i am weak but thou art [Music] oh [Music] and just [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Applause] dear lord let it be and through this world of toilet stairs [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh just a closer walk with thee
