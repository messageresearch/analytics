[16:01] if you want to offer
[16:32] Ed
[16:37] all the places
[16:56] I
[17:02] know
[17:08] foreign
[17:18] when a man's ways please the Lord he
[17:20] maketh even his enemies to be at peace
[17:22] with him
[17:30] a man's heart devises his way but the
[17:32] Lord directeth his steps
[17:41] just wait and balance are the Lord's all
[17:44] the weights of the bag are his work
[17:56] righteous lips are the Delight of kings
[17:58] and they love him that speaketh right
[18:07] in the light of the king's countenance
[18:10] is life and his favor is as a cloud of
[18:13] the latter rain
[18:23] the highway of the upright is to depart
[18:26] from Evil he that keepeth his way
[18:28] preserveth his soul
[18:37] better it is to be of a humble spirit
[18:39] with the lowly than than to divide the
[18:42] spoil with the proud
[18:52] the wise in heart Shall be Called
[18:54] prudent and the sweetness of the lips
[18:56] increases learning
[19:05] the heart of the wise teacheth his mouth
[19:08] and added learning to his lips
[19:14] so far
[19:17] there is a way that sameth right into a
[19:19] man but the end thereof are the ways of
[19:22] death
[19:29] and ungodly man dicketh of evil in his
[19:33] lips there are there is as a burning
[19:36] fire
[19:44] a violent man enticeth his neighbor and
[19:46] leadeth him into the way that is not
[19:49] good
[19:57] the hoary head is the Crown of Glory if
[20:00] it be found in the way of righteousness
[20:10] the law is cast into the lab but the
[20:14] whole disposing thereof is of the Lord
[20:19] whoever's
[20:27] foreign
[20:47] brothers and sisters
[20:49] I hope you're enjoying your first day of
[20:52] the new year
[20:53] you know that song we just read there's
[20:56] I'm not some why did I say some that
[20:58] proverb that I guess I'm getting old
[21:00] that probably we just read I mean
[21:03] there's so many different truths
[21:06] that you could spend hours starting and
[21:07] it's unbelievable but I was just
[21:09] thinking you know today today's the
[21:12] first of January in the year of 2023 and
[21:17] I was just thinking
[21:19] it's it's a marvelous thing for the
[21:21] believer but it's also a terrible thing
[21:23] for the unbeliever and I and that's
[21:26] Psalm we were eating
[21:28] kind of talks about that point you know
[21:30] and I was just thinking you know a king
[21:32] without righteousness
[21:34] is an evil thing a government without
[21:37] righteousness is an evil thing and I was
[21:40] just thinking this morning and that's
[21:42] where we're at this morning all the
[21:44] governments of the world are corrupted
[21:45] they're corrupted by their own desires
[21:47] for evil and political slash monetary
[21:51] gain everything's corrupted so what uh
[21:54] hope do you have this morning what
[21:56] should you be worried the only thing you
[21:58] really should be worried not even
[21:59] worried all you should be doing is
[22:01] forcing you to push you further into
[22:04] Jesus Christ if anything that's going on
[22:06] in the world it should be doing the
[22:08] opposite of what it's doing to the world
[22:10] and be bringing you closer to our
[22:13] relationship this morning with Jesus
[22:15] Christ without drawing you away from it
[22:17] but it actually should be leading you
[22:19] toward
[22:21] but before I get started this morning I
[22:24] was
[22:25] uh I as we start the new year uh we
[22:28] hadn't had Church in a couple of
[22:29] services
[22:31] so we go into the new year the loan
[22:33] amount that the principal amount on the
[22:35] loan is nineteen thousand dollars
[22:39] 600 and a little bit of change
[22:42] uh because we're so far ahead in the in
[22:45] the church loan I don't get the
[22:48] I still have to make an interest payment
[22:50] but they don't send me envelopes anymore
[22:52] because we're so far ahead for the year
[22:54] so that's where we're at in the uh
[22:57] building fund we have twenty three
[22:58] hundred dollars
[23:00] as we go into
[23:02] the new year and in the general fund
[23:05] after the deposit before
[23:07] Christmas we have ten thousand dollars
[23:09] and a little bit of change in it so God
[23:12] has blessed us
[23:14] um and you all know the issue we had
[23:15] this week
[23:16] uh we haven't I haven't made any claims
[23:19] yet until we resolve all the issues
[23:23] um
[23:24] it's changing going right back to where
[23:26] I was
[23:27] was that before you know I was listening
[23:30] to some messages this morning and it's
[23:32] really important for the year that we
[23:34] live in there are two well as we go into
[23:38] the year 2023 brother Brown was in these
[23:42] messages as I'm playing on my old
[23:45] talking about and the messages that deal
[23:47] with investment and the one thing I
[23:50] heard this morning that really struck me
[23:53] is that God's only he's concerned about
[23:56] it don't get me wrong with what I'm
[23:58] about to say but he's actually looking
[24:00] at a god-inspired
[24:02] God set up church and a god-led church
[24:05] that's what God's desire is to have the
[24:09] inspiration of the Holy Ghost in the
[24:12] Church of the hour that we live in and
[24:14] that will bring about
[24:15] God's
[24:17] construction Force it'll also keep you
[24:20] set on the path for the year that's
[24:22] coming ahead that we're going to have to
[24:24] go through you know you know I was just
[24:26] I was thinking there you know where
[24:29] actually I was just thinking in the year
[24:30] two in the 2020s
[24:33] all the upheaval that's going on in the
[24:35] world that we live in is no different
[24:37] than
[24:38] the 1920s now was any
[24:40] for someone to be alive to know what was
[24:43] going on in the 1920s he'd almost have
[24:46] to be 120 years plus to be a young man
[24:49] or a young woman going through that
[24:51] period but all the problems are is no
[24:54] different today in our own country the
[24:56] country is about to go into an economic
[24:58] clap collapse if they don't change their
[25:00] ways all the crazy stuff that was going
[25:03] on in the 1920s is going on in the 2000
[25:07] and 2020s so it's
[25:09] but for the believer there shouldn't be
[25:11] any hesitation any fear as you look at
[25:15] the calendars as the years keep going by
[25:17] it's your Brent like I said uh
[25:20] repetitive but it should keep bringing
[25:22] you back to the truth of the word
[25:25] of the hour if you would turn with me um
[25:28] I was about to say something I say it a
[25:30] lot so I I stopped from saying if you
[25:32] told me to Luke this morning the 17th
[25:36] and the 18th chapter of Luke
[25:39] and I'll just read a few of these
[25:41] scriptures
[25:42] this morning
[25:45] also uh wrote this other stuff down over
[25:48] here but but I was
[25:51] I was thinking of this uh Parable
[25:54] um the truth if you'll turn with me to
[25:56] Luke the 17th chapter starting about the
[26:00] fifth verse there you know there's a lot
[26:03] if you I have a Thompson Chain or
[26:06] reference Bible
[26:07] but if you open a Thompson Chain
[26:10] reference between the 17th
[26:12] into the 18th chapter there's a lot of
[26:15] things that go on in the life of Jesus
[26:17] Christ and his disciples but I'll start
[26:19] at this fifth verse here and the
[26:21] apostles said unto the Lord increase our
[26:23] faith and I I'm raising my hand this
[26:25] morning I'm sure everyone else is the
[26:28] same way as we go into a new year Lord
[26:31] just increase my faith that I'm not
[26:33] looking at the circumstances but I'm
[26:35] looking at the promises and it goes and
[26:37] it goes on to say here increase our
[26:39] faith and the Lord said if you had Faith
[26:41] as a grain of a mustard seed you might
[26:44] say unto this
[26:45] forgive my pronunciation sock Mind Tree
[26:48] be plucked up
[26:50] and be thou planted in the sea and it
[26:54] should obey you and that's where
[26:55] everyone else is this morning if you
[26:58] have that faith God can bring about the
[27:00] change of your circumstances this
[27:01] morning
[27:02] but which of you having a servant
[27:04] plowing or feeding cattle
[27:06] will say unto him by and by when he has
[27:09] come from the field go and sit down to
[27:12] meet
[27:12] will not rather say unto him make ready
[27:15] where we're
[27:16] I may stop and gird myself and serve me
[27:19] I have eaten and drunken and afterward
[27:21] thou shall eat and drink
[27:23] and and he goes on death he does he
[27:26] thank the servant because he did the
[27:27] things that were commanded of him I
[27:30] trial not basically I believe not
[27:33] so likewise ye when you shall have done
[27:35] all the things which you were commanded
[27:37] you say we are unprofitable serpents and
[27:41] we have done that which was our duty to
[27:43] do and that's where we're at this
[27:46] morning no matter what's going on all
[27:48] you can
[27:49] me is the servant that God wants you to
[27:51] be this morning and keep plugging along
[27:53] in the year that's ahead I wrote these
[27:56] things down these I've really I guess I
[27:58] wrote them to myself
[28:01] these uh five questions I guess
[28:04] we have to ask ours ourselves every day
[28:07] and every year
[28:10] to us is God real to you is God real
[28:13] life in your walk in every that way you
[28:16] rub up against the people in the world
[28:18] your own families is God real to you
[28:21] this morning and I can't answer that for
[28:24] you I can only answer it for myself
[28:27] and then the other question I would ask
[28:29] myself
[28:31] and sometimes this is that this is when
[28:34] Satan comes to you does God really care
[28:37] about me does he care does God care
[28:39] about my situations that are going on
[28:42] with me and my life you can answer that
[28:44] question I can answer I believe that God
[28:47] cares and I know he cares but like I
[28:49] said that's a question that your enemy
[28:51] is going to ask you every day of your
[28:53] life do you think God Bears about you
[28:55] next one
[28:57] is God in the heart of his people or I
[29:00] would say to myself as God in my heart
[29:02] is he continually leading me in the
[29:05] truth of his word and the hour that we
[29:07] live in this morning the other thing is
[29:10] most important one here
[29:14] the fourth one I have is God real in his
[29:17] church
[29:19] you that's really important God has to
[29:21] be real in his church the power of the
[29:23] Holy Ghost has to be inspiring every
[29:26] individual here this morning it's just
[29:28] not a duty that we're
[29:30] going but we're doing it out of love for
[29:33] Jesus Christ and the other question I
[29:35] wrote to myself
[29:36] and I'm going to go back to this chapter
[29:38] and read it
[29:40] because God raised the standard to meet
[29:42] the new year or to meet what your
[29:44] circumstances are and
[29:47] you can answer that question I can't
[29:49] answer it for you but I was going to
[29:51] jump back here and read that some of you
[29:53] will probably know where I'm going if I
[29:54] haven't if I haven't lost my place here
[29:57] which I have a habit of doing but it's
[29:59] in the 59th chapter of
[30:03] Isaiah and it's start I'll start at a
[30:08] about the 16
[30:10] th verse here in the 59th
[30:13] of Isaiah
[30:18] in a hurry don't give you time to catch
[30:20] up
[30:24] I'm going to start at the 15th first
[30:25] year yeah true faileth and he that
[30:28] departed from Evil maketh himself a prey
[30:31] and the Lord sought and it displeased
[30:33] him that there was no judgment
[30:36] I can just think of our current society
[30:39] that we live in you know there's no
[30:41] judgment people just continue things and
[30:44] you always wonder sometimes they're ever
[30:46] going to be any accountability and he
[30:49] goes on to say here in the 16th verse
[30:51] and he saw there was no man and wondered
[30:54] that there was no intercessor there was
[30:57] therefore his arm brought salvation unto
[30:59] him and his righteousness had sustained
[31:02] him
[31:03] for you put on righteousness as a
[31:05] breastplate and a helmet of salvation
[31:08] and he put on the garments of Vengeance
[31:10] for clothing and was caught with the
[31:13] seal as a cloak
[31:14] and according to their deeds according
[31:16] he will repay Fury to his adversaries
[31:19] reprehens to his enemies and to the
[31:22] islands he will repay replicants and we
[31:25] know as we go back in the gospel what
[31:28] Jesus had to say about there's always a
[31:30] time for judgment
[31:31] right now is the time of Grace and this
[31:35] 19th verse is what I was thinking about
[31:36] this morning
[31:38] so shall the fear of the name of the
[31:39] Lord from the West and his glory from
[31:41] the rising of the Sun
[31:43] and this is really important to me or to
[31:46] watch this year
[31:48] and me shall come in like a flood
[31:50] and the spirit of the Lord shall lift up
[31:52] a standard against him and that's where
[31:54] we're at this morning wherever your
[31:56] circumstances are if you put your trust
[31:59] in him he's going to raise up that
[32:00] standard for you he's going to lead you
[32:02] and make you successful whatever your
[32:04] tribulation is this morning you know
[32:07] you've got to believe it for yourself
[32:08] people can encourage you lead you guide
[32:11] you but you have to step out in faith
[32:13] yourself and it goes on on the 21st here
[32:16] and said the Redeemer shall come design
[32:18] and unto them that turn from
[32:20] transgression to Jacob saith Lord
[32:23] and this last verse as for me this is my
[32:26] Covenant with them saith the Lord my
[32:28] spirit that is upon thee my words which
[32:30] I have put in thy mouth shall not depart
[32:33] out of thy mouth nor
[32:35] out of the mouth of
[32:37] thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy
[32:39] seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth
[32:42] and forever you know it's a you know it
[32:45] goes back to what God said to Moses in
[32:47] the burning bush it's a living God I am
[32:50] that I am and it's the same thing for us
[32:52] this morning Jesus Christ hasn't changed
[32:54] we might get away from him but the
[32:56] spirit of the Holy Ghost and Christ
[32:57] himself he never changes as long as
[33:00] you're pushing toward him he's going to
[33:02] meet you Brother David
[33:05] foreign
[33:13] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[33:15] this morning and
[33:18] looking forward to what God has for us
[33:20] by the way of his word this morning and
[33:22] you man I don't know about you but I'm
[33:23] excited this morning and looking forward
[33:26] to what he's got for us in store and hey
