[0:00] in the psalms
[0:01] we're going to go to psalms 1 15.
[0:05] it's a little bit
[0:08] longer than the some of them but
[0:12] psalms 115
[0:22] not unto us o lord not unto us but unto
[0:25] thy name give glory for thy mercy and
[0:27] for thy truth's sake
[0:35] but our god is in the heavens
[0:37] he had done whatsoever he had pleased
[0:44] they have mouse but they speak not eyes
[0:46] have they but they see none
[0:54] they have hands but that they handle not
[0:57] feet have they but they walk not neither
[1:00] speak they through their throat
[1:08] o israel trust thou in the lord he is
[1:11] their help and their shield
[1:19] ye that fear the lord trust in the lord
[1:21] he is their help and their shield
[1:32] you'll bless them that fear the lord
[1:34] both small and great
[1:41] you're blessed of the lord which made
[1:43] heaven and earth
[1:52] dead praise not the lord neither any
[1:54] that go down unto silence
[1:56] but we will bless the lord for this time
[1:59] forth and forevermore praise the lord
[2:02] god bless you may be seated brother
[2:04] brian
[2:14] good morning brothers and sisters
[2:17] you know as we were reading that song
[2:18] they were talking
[2:20] about the house of israel and about
[2:22] aaron
[2:23] and uh the thing about aaron is that's
[2:26] the priesthood that was given to the
[2:28] children of israel so god's talking to
[2:30] the children of israel and he's talking
[2:32] to the house of aaron
[2:34] and he meant suspiciously mentioned as i
[2:37] was reading that but
[2:39] it says house of aaron trust in the lord
[2:41] he is their help and their shield
[2:43] so he's telling the priests that they
[2:45] need
[2:46] that they need to be prepared you know
[2:48] if you go back to uh the old testament
[2:52] the lord told the the aaron the levites
[2:55] they were supposed to put the word of
[2:56] the lord
[2:58] before the people because they couldn't
[3:00] read and write like we do and the only
[3:02] way they could know the word of god is
[3:04] through the priests as they were taught
[3:06] by the priest and it's a pretty solemn
[3:08] job that the children of aaron had with
[3:11] the children of israel
[3:12] and i was also thinking
[3:15] about talking about false gods but you
[3:18] know right now in the age that we live
[3:20] in the false gods that the world has and
[3:22] people have
[3:24] really aren't images you know physical
[3:26] images of a fault not to say that some
[3:28] don't you know if you
[3:30] but it's actually an idea
[3:33] they make their education a religion
[3:35] they make their ideas a religion so it
[3:38] doesn't have to be a physical thing they
[3:39] put everything that they have
[3:41] before believing the lord and uh if you
[3:43] turn with me to mark the
[3:46] first for the third chapter
[3:50] i was talking to them in the prayer room
[3:53] the
[3:54] the
[3:55] before i get started the offering for
[3:57] the principal amount was
[3:59] five hundred dollars
[4:00] and i went ahead and made that uh that
[4:03] uh
[4:04] principal payment on on friday
[4:07] and
[4:08] the way i have
[4:09] figured i'll have to reconcile
[4:12] once they send me the next
[4:14] payment in september
[4:16] uh that leaves the principal amount
[4:18] right now as of this morning 60
[4:23] 547 dollars
[4:25] and i was telling them back there when i
[4:26] make the next payment
[4:28] uh it'll readjust the the amount of
[4:31] interest i pay every month also so
[4:34] with the next payment we'll be down to
[4:36] uh
[4:37] after the 10th of september we will
[4:40] probably
[4:41] be down in the low 59 000
[4:44] mark so we're slowly but surely getting
[4:46] it knocked off
[4:48] and um and after all all the all the
[4:52] said and done
[4:53] and uh from through the summer so far
[4:56] and there's two things i haven't that
[4:57] are going to happen here real soon for
[4:59] the church
[5:01] uh if i have enough if they're the
[5:03] church i remember change that if the
[5:05] church has enough money i usually do a
[5:08] summer fill for the
[5:10] for the fuel tank
[5:12] and then i do a prepaid
[5:14] if i have enough money and we'll see and
[5:17] then the other thing i have to do or the
[5:19] church has to do on the 30th of
[5:21] september
[5:24] is when the church
[5:25] insurance renews against and
[5:29] that's
[5:30] lately it's been around three thousand
[5:33] dollars for the year
[5:34] and that's
[5:36] liability plus
[5:38] uh you know
[5:40] that's liability plus regular
[5:43] insurance for the fire and damage in the
[5:45] church so it seems like a lot but it a
[5:49] lot of it is liability also and when we
[5:52] do
[5:53] the liability is for everything that
[5:55] goes on in the church
[5:56] and plus the two buildings that we have
[5:58] the fellowship hall and
[6:00] and the church so those are the two
[6:02] expensive things
[6:04] that we have coming to the church here
[6:06] and and it's not very far
[6:08] and if i don't think there's enough
[6:10] money in the general fund to do the
[6:13] to do a uh prepaid for the winter time
[6:16] then i'll just
[6:17] i'll usually just pay the insurance it
[6:21] just depends on where we're at as a
[6:22] church
[6:23] you have usually to september 30th to do
[6:26] that prepaid for the following year
[6:28] where you get a better rate with the
[6:30] propane which i don't even know what it
[6:32] is right now i hadn't bought any in a
[6:34] while
[6:35] but like i said if you have any
[6:36] questions don't be afraid to come up and
[6:38] ask me and i was
[6:40] just reading this morning
[6:42] i was also thinking coming up here i was
[6:44] thinking about what brother branham said
[6:45] one time
[6:46] he said you know
[6:49] he was talking about that
[6:50] that over-educated preacher if he'd have
[6:52] gone up the way he came down
[6:55] then he'd be a lot better off and
[6:57] i'm not trying to be funny i was just
[6:59] thinking about that myself this morning
[7:01] but i was uh reading
[7:03] in this
[7:04] uh
[7:05] in this spoken word book here this
[7:08] morning
[7:09] and i was thinking about what to say
[7:12] and uh this is from
[7:14] this is then jesus came
[7:17] i'd have to give you the year but not
[7:19] taking a lot of time it's the 11th page
[7:24] and i'll just he's talking about the
[7:26] woman that had the blood issue but i
[7:28] just want to read what and it's no
[7:30] different for the day that we live and
[7:32] you know people will laugh you to scorn
[7:34] if you tell them you believe god's word
[7:36] and you're going to put god's word
[7:37] before anything else they're just going
[7:39] to laugh you that's going they're going
[7:40] to make fun of you and if they don't
[7:42] laugh at you they'll wait until you walk
[7:44] away and then they'll make make a big
[7:46] scene but i'll just see what brother
[7:49] branham had to say here this morning
[7:51] this morning and then maybe some
[7:53] scriptures from here
[7:55] and it's about the 73rd quote it says he
[7:57] said
[7:58] whosoever will come and drink from the
[8:00] waters of life freely
[8:03] and that's really important it's open
[8:05] it's an open invitation this morning to
[8:07] every individual here those waters are
[8:09] free the waters of life they're free for
[8:11] you this morning
[8:13] now the enemy might try to put walls in
[8:15] your way but god is not putting any
[8:17] walls in your way this morning it's
[8:19] totally open for you this morning to
[8:21] reach out there in faith and he goes on
[8:23] to say don't listen to him for he's the
[8:25] devil and that look little woman got
[8:28] down where jesus was coming up and
[8:29] people rallying around on porn so forth
[8:32] and this is what i was thinking more
[8:34] about and there stood the priest all the
[8:36] great leaders of their her religion
[8:39] and they were making fun of him
[8:41] and say oh you're the one that heals the
[8:43] sick or you uh we've got plenty of sick
[8:47] and that's how that's how sick people
[8:48] really are when you say
[8:50] you're playing praying for somebody well
[8:52] they say well we've got loads of other
[8:54] sick people they'll always take
[8:56] something good and something wholesome
[8:59] and make something evil out of it and uh
[9:01] and that kind of spirit you really you
[9:03] have to get to a point in your life
[9:05] where you choose what kind of spirit
[9:07] you're going to be around and there
[9:09] stood the priest and all the great
[9:10] leaders in her religion and they were
[9:12] making fun of him saying
[9:14] you're the one who heals the sick oh
[9:16] well we've got plenty of sick let's see
[9:18] you heal him oh you're the one that
[9:20] raises the dead are you well we got a
[9:23] grave full of them there let's let's see
[9:26] you raise them and that's you know
[9:27] that's people making fun of what you
[9:28] believe and what god has done for you
[9:32] and he goes on he never
[9:34] he never even paid attention to them he
[9:36] just walked on he had one thing to do
[9:38] and that one thing that god showed him
[9:40] to do
[9:42] and nothing less nothing more and when
[9:44] christians get to that place where he'll
[9:47] lay aside and not listen to all the
[9:49] scandals and stuff that's said and all
[9:51] that's going on and have one motive and
[9:53] that is to do the will of god
[9:55] that god sent you to do there's nothing
[9:57] there'll be a different day in a
[9:59] different church and i was just thinking
[10:01] about that you know in the age that we
[10:03] live in there's so much that
[10:05] satan's trying to put in our is trying
[10:07] to put in our way to make us discouraged
[10:10] make you not look at the things you
[10:12] should be looking at but looking at
[10:13] other things
[10:14] and uh this is the first chapter if you
[10:18] come with me to the first chapter of the
[10:20] book of mark
[10:21] and i was also i i was you know i guess
[10:24] as you get older you start remembering
[10:26] the things from your youth form i don't
[10:28] i'm i'm only just about to be 63 i don't
[10:31] know if that's true or not
[10:33] but i was thinking this morning
[10:35] uh there where i where i went to church
[10:38] years ago
[10:39] um in lima ohio there was a brother out
[10:42] of london
[10:43] ohio his name was brother peterson he
[10:45] used to preach a lot and he used to talk
[10:48] all of it goes back to what i was just
[10:50] saying his major
[10:52] theme a lot of times is he would tell
[10:54] people you've got to use your gospel 44
[10:57] and you would look and say what's the
[10:58] gospel 44 and basically that weapon that
[11:01] you have this morning that pistol that
[11:03] you have that will kill every devil that
[11:05] tries to come into your life this
[11:07] morning and that is uh if you go to luke
[11:10] 4 and 44 and 44
[11:12] uh excuse me luke 4 4.
[11:15] basically it is where jesus has been
[11:17] taken up in in the mountain and he says
[11:20] that
[11:21] when
[11:22] he was hungry but jesus said man shall
[11:24] live by
[11:26] not bread alone but every word of god
[11:28] and that's where we're at this morning
[11:29] but you need to live by
[11:32] your weapon the thing that'll make you
[11:34] successful in the day that we live this
[11:36] morning is that before you put anything
[11:38] else in front of yourself that you're
[11:40] always going to put the word of god
[11:42] before you this morning if you put the
[11:44] word
[11:45] of
[11:46] god
[11:48] before you in any room whatever is going
[11:50] on in your life and be successful it'll
[11:53] push all those
[11:54] black thoughts away all those evil
[11:57] thoughts away and it'll make you
[11:58] successful
[12:00] i know i'm carrying on here but i'll
[12:02] read here this
[12:04] um
[12:06] starting at about the 31st verse and
[12:09] no i'm thirsty i'm losing my place here
[12:14] and even when the sun did the 32nd verse
[12:17] here
[12:19] at
[12:20] evening when the sun did say they
[12:22] brought on to him all that were diseased
[12:24] and them that were possessed with devils
[12:26] you know this word is just applicable
[12:29] for you this morning whatever your
[12:30] situation is this morning you know god
[12:33] you know we all believe jesus christ the
[12:35] same yesterday
[12:36] today and forever so as you read of the
[12:38] word of god it's just as powerful for us
[12:41] today as it was for them in jesus's day
[12:45] and he goes i lost my pleasure and all
[12:47] the city was gathered together at the
[12:49] door
[12:50] and he healed many that were sick of
[12:52] diverse diseases and cast out many
[12:54] devils and suffered not the devils to
[12:56] speak
[12:57] because
[12:58] they knew him and you know we could all
[13:00] have that powerful life this morning
[13:02] there's nothing to keep you from it and
[13:04] he goes i lost my place again and in the
[13:06] morning rising up
[13:08] i miss he healed many that were sick
[13:10] with divers diseases cast out many
[13:12] endeavors and suffered not the devils to
[13:15] speak because they knew him
[13:16] and in the morning rising up
[13:18] a great while before the day
[13:21] he went out and departed onto a solitary
[13:24] place and there prayed
[13:26] and simon and they that were with him
[13:29] followed after him and when they had
[13:30] found him they said on them all men seek
[13:33] things he said let us go on to the next
[13:36] town that i may preach there also for
[13:38] therefore come
[13:40] and i was thinking
[13:41] you know
[13:42] christ gave us an example as individuals
[13:45] this morning
[13:47] and the exam he set that example for i'm
[13:49] not going to take a lot of time i know i
[13:51] say that a lot
[13:52] but you know you have an example this
[13:55] morning you have to actually
[13:57] you have
[13:58] multiple examples
[14:00] and a lot of times your enemy is going
[14:02] to want to make you look at that man or
[14:04] that woman that says there's something
[14:06] and aren't living what they're saying
[14:08] but you do have examples this morning
[14:11] your most important example is jesus
[14:13] christ in the word of god and then you
[14:16] have the message of the hour and its
[14:18] messenger so as as the troubles come to
[14:21] you in your life or whatever that
[14:23] situation is you have the
[14:26] examples to follow and the example i was
[14:28] just
[14:29] really struck me this morning
[14:31] is that the time you put into anything
[14:34] will make you successful whether it's
[14:36] business whether it's sports
[14:39] well it's the same being a christian
[14:41] more in a spiritual sense
[14:43] what you spend your time in spiritually
[14:45] is what you're going to be this morning
[14:47] and jesus spent his time he set that
[14:50] example for us that he started the day
[14:52] in prayer and he finished the day in
[14:54] prayer brother david
[15:06] amen
[15:07] praise the lord we're gonna have a
[15:09] testimony here before we get started in
[15:10] worship would that be all right
[15:12] amen you know
[15:14] i mean god sometimes god just does
[15:16] something special amen i believe in this
[15:19] case probably be a guardian angel or
[15:21] something so i certainly believe in
[15:23] guardian angels don't you brother
[15:24] tommy's going to come and give us a
[15:25] testimony this morning amen praise the
[15:28] lord appreciate brother tommy amen and
[15:30] the work that the lord is doing in his
[15:32] life and the zeal that he has
[15:34] for the lord amen
[15:44] yeah well the lord was exercising my
[15:46] faith wings a couple weeks back
[15:49] it was pretty crazy brother uh irving me
[15:52] and him was getting ready to hook up the
[15:53] bush hog
[15:55] and uh the jack wasn't on the bush hog
[15:57] it was stacked up on some six by sixes
[16:00] well i got on this side of the bush hog
[16:02] and had the pto shaft i'm like well
[16:04] because he was backing in he was coming
[16:05] in there and uh i scooted on this side

[49:53] started this morning and just to kind of
[49:56] put us in perspective where we're going
[49:58] probably said my grandfather wrote an ox
[50:00] cart
[50:01] i'm driving a ford v8 and my son will
[50:04] fly a jet plane
[50:06] that's where we're moving on
[50:08] he said that's what religion ought to be
[50:11] the coming of the lord is at hand how
[50:13] many believe that this morning
[50:15] the coming of the lord is at hand he
[50:17] says the church ought to be moving on
[50:20] into their
[50:22] powers
[50:23] science can can climb so far but then it
[50:27] has to drop off
[50:29] but we've got untapped sources
[50:33] listen to this that has never been
[50:35] touched
[50:37] that has never been touched the power
[50:40] unlimited of god
[50:43] that we ought to be moving into
[50:47] you believe that
[50:48] but listen to what he says next he said
[50:50] but we're living a million miles under
[50:53] privileges tonight
[50:55] under of the privileges that christians
[50:57] ought to be enjoying he said and i feel
[50:59] ashamed of myself to look out here and
[51:02] see institutions and the sicknesses and
[51:05] troubles that's going on right now he
[51:07] says our church listen now our church
[51:10] he's speaking to us he's speaking to
[51:12] believers he's speaking to the people
[51:14] that that are living in this last day
[51:16] this last age that are following the
[51:18] last age message he says listen our
[51:20] church ought to be walking the street
[51:23] healing the sick
[51:26] raising the dead
[51:28] casting out devils
[51:30] doing signs and wonders don't you get
[51:32] tired on me now
[51:35] just because i'm talking about things
[51:36] we're supposed to be doing and not doing
[51:38] don't you get tired on me
[51:40] we're supposed to be raising the dead
[51:42] casting out devils doing signs and
[51:44] wonders making the whole world realize
[51:47] that christ jesus lives
[51:51] that's what we ought to be doing he says
[51:55] turn with me to the book of jeremiah
[51:58] jeremiah chapter one
[52:08] god is sure good to us
[52:13] jeremiah chapter one
[52:16] i've got to get my glasses for this i'm
[52:18] reading now my bible here has came to me
[52:20] on the way to church
[52:21] two minutes time from my house to here
[52:23] the lord gave me this to read so
[52:28] chapter one of jeremiah and verse four
[52:31] we'll read
[52:35] in the
[52:36] word of the lord say amen if you're
[52:38] there
[52:39] i want you to see this for yourself this
[52:41] morning
[52:42] then the word of the lord came unto me
[52:44] saying before i formed thee in the belly
[52:48] i knew thee
[52:50] and before thou cometh forth out of the
[52:52] womb i sanctified thee
[52:55] and i ordained thee
[52:58] a prophet unto the nations then said i
[53:00] allah lord god behold i cannot speak
[53:04] for i am a child
[53:06] but the lord said unto me say not i am a
[53:09] child
[53:10] for thou shalt go into
[53:12] all that i shall send thee
[53:15] and whatsoever i
[53:16] command thee thou shall speak
[53:19] be not afraid watch now we live in a
[53:21] world a wicked world
[53:23] a wicked world that is against us and we
[53:25] talk about this a lot but it's becoming
[53:27] reality more and more every day
[53:30] we live in a wicked world
[53:32] but he says be not afraid of their faces
[53:35] for
[53:36] what does this say i am
[53:40] i am
[53:41] i am
[53:43] with thee
[53:44] to deliver thee saith the lord now i
[53:47] want you to notice that i am
[53:49] we're going to talk about that i am
[53:52] then the lord put forth his hand and
[53:54] touched my mouth
[53:59] and the lord said unto me behold i have
[54:01] put my words my words in
[54:05] thy mouth
[54:06] god right here talking to the prophet
[54:08] jeremiah pouring himself into
[54:11] the prophet saying i'm gonna touch your
[54:13] mouth your lips will no longer be your
[54:15] lips your words will now be my words
[54:22] i put my words into thy mouth see i have
[54:25] this day set thee over nations over
[54:28] kingdoms to root out to pull down and to
[54:31] destroy and to throw down and build and
[54:34] to plant

[55:38] service and may all glory be given to

[55:44] your seats
[55:45] turn with me to the book of acts if you
[55:47] would for just one minute i want to read
[55:48] one more portion of scripture
[55:53] i'm going to try not to to hold you
[55:55] along
[55:55] i'll warn you i'm in uncharted territory
[55:58] again this morning i i
[56:01] i i usually print my stuff on
[56:04] font 14. i can't see it no more we was
[56:06] talking about our vision back there and
[56:08] every one of us back there can't see no
[56:10] more
[56:12] so
[56:13] i had to blow it up and so i've got more
[56:15] pages so i hope we'll stay within our
[56:17] time frame brother jeff
[56:19] but acts chapter 2
[56:23] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[56:24] come
[56:26] they were all with one accord
[56:29] in one place
[56:31] and suddenly there came a sound from
[56:32] heaven as a rushing mighty wind
[56:35] and it filled all the house where they
[56:36] were sitting and there appeared unto
[56:39] them cloven tongues as a fire and sat
[56:42] upon each of them
[56:44] and they were all filled with the holy
[56:48] ghost
[56:50] and they began to speak with other
[56:52] tongues as the spirit gave them
[56:55] utterance so here we are on the day of
[56:58] pentecost the group of people are
[57:00] gathered together and they're they're
[57:02] kind of mourning they're kind of
[57:04] you know and
[57:06] trying to figure out what direction
[57:07] they're going to go but they're praying
[57:09] out they're seeking
[57:10] they're trying to get the movement of
[57:11] god and all of a sudden the spirit comes
[57:14] down upon them and people from all
[57:16] nationalities all different places and
[57:18] races that are there together and talk
[57:21] about what's going to happen now they're
[57:23] all speaking one language and the people
[57:26] look at them and it confuses the people
[57:29] in verse 12 it says they were amazed and
[57:31] they doubted and saying what does this
[57:33] mean
[57:34] what does this mean and they mocked them
[57:36] and said these guys are drunk
[57:38] now peter knowing what was going on
[57:40] peter being a man of god could feel the
[57:42] anointing that he once felt the days
[57:45] that he walked with jesus
[57:47] the same anointing that same presence
[57:49] that we're talking about peter reckon i
[57:52] said no no no no these men are not drunk
[57:54] they're not full of new wine this is
[57:56] only the third hour a day we've been
[57:58] drinking people
[58:00] but there is something amongst us that
[58:03] we can't explain right at this point
[58:05] it's a presence of jesus christ the man
[58:07] of galilee
[58:09] and we feel that presence and this is
[58:11] the way we're acting
[58:16] it's told just as the prophet joel
[58:20] and he said it shall come to pass in the
[58:22] last days that i will pour out my spirit
[58:25] upon all flesh
[58:27] and your sons and daughters shall
[58:29] prophesy and your young men shall see
[58:31] visions and your old men shall dream
[58:34] dreams
[58:36] my message to us this morning is acts
[58:39] the sequel
[58:43] are you with me
[58:44] acts
[58:45] the sequel and as i talk about acts the
[58:48] sequel
[58:49] i want to talk a little bit about a
[58:50] pentecostal experience
[58:53] and don't get scared
[58:56] i'm talking about a pentecostal
[58:57] experience i'm talking about more than
[59:00] just the pentecostal experience that
[59:01] we've we've heard about and we've seen
[59:03] about in the in in the last 50 years 50
[59:06] 60 70 years ago when the move went
[59:08] through and and the tongues went forth
[59:10] and then the pentecostals began to put a
[59:12] a movement around it that said if you
[59:14] don't speak in tongues you don't have
[59:16] the holy ghost if you don't shout if you
[59:18] don't have the holy ghost if you don't
[59:19] come to the altar and and get your back
[59:21] beat on to you till you do something you
[59:23] don't have the holy that's not what i'm
[59:24] talking about that is all part of it
[59:26] don't get me wrong
[59:28] that is all a genuine portion of the
[59:31] holy ghost
[59:32] but what i'm talking about is a portion
[59:34] of pentecost that says we as believers
[59:36] can say silver and gold have i none but
[59:38] what i have i give a thief
[59:41] that's the pentecostal experience i'm
[59:43] talking about i'm talking about a life
[59:45] of christ that dwells in us that makes
[59:47] us more
[59:49] than just talking in tongues
[59:52] now don't get me wrong
[59:54] i love the presence when you get into a
[59:56] place and it's quiet
[59:58] and i experienced this some maybe three
[1:00:02] three two three years ago
[1:00:04] first time i ever experienced but what
[1:00:06] an experience it was when i found myself
[1:00:08] locked away into a private place
[1:00:11] first time i've ever shared this but
[1:00:13] found myself locked away in a private
[1:00:15] place and i began to pray the lord i
[1:00:17] said lord i want to feel your presence
[1:00:21] i don't want to talk to you i want to
[1:00:23] feel your presence and i laid there in
[1:00:27] the bed and i was praying and praying
[1:00:29] and praying and i felt such a peace and
[1:00:31] a calm come over me
[1:00:33] and it was a feeling like i've never
[1:00:35] felt before and i was just praying and
[1:00:37] praying and before i knew it
[1:00:40] i was praying in some kind of gibberish
[1:00:43] i've never heard in my life and i
[1:00:44] couldn't stop and i prayed and i prayed
[1:00:46] and it just kept going and it was like
[1:00:48] there was a communication but i i it was
[1:00:51] just it was different
[1:00:53] that is a true cause to experience
[1:00:57] but i want more
[1:00:59] i want more than what that is
[1:01:04] many of you know and can relate to
[1:01:07] good movies or books they're hard to
[1:01:09] come by
[1:01:11] and so when you find a good movie or a
[1:01:13] good book and
[1:01:14] we begin to all get wrapped up into the
[1:01:16] story line and the characters of this
[1:01:18] movie or a book or whatever it is you're
[1:01:20] you're
[1:01:22] wrapped up in and the producers a lot of
[1:01:25] times they
[1:01:26] and the authors they look at these
[1:01:27] movies and these books and they have a
[1:01:29] way of captivating their audiences
[1:01:32] and they draw you in they suck you into
[1:01:34] the plot
[1:01:36] they suck you into to the characters to
[1:01:38] where you're you're really enthralled
[1:01:40] and you're beginning to read and you're
[1:01:42] looking and you just got to know what's
[1:01:44] going to happen next
[1:01:46] and you begin to watch this and many
[1:01:48] times you you get to the point in the
[1:01:50] movie or the book and you you think man
[1:01:52] this is this is fixing to be the climax
[1:01:53] the plot of this whole thing is fixing
[1:01:55] to be unveiled and
[1:01:57] what's it do it leaves you hanging
[1:02:00] it leaves you hanging to a place and you
[1:02:03] begin to look at you say
[1:02:05] the movie's ending but i know it's not
[1:02:07] over
[1:02:09] it's ending but i know it's not over you
[1:02:12] know there's more to the story and it's
[1:02:14] just beginning to get good and it can't
[1:02:17] end like
[1:02:18] this and what happens
[1:02:21] before you know it there's another movie
[1:02:25] there's another book
[1:02:27] and that's what's called the sequel so
[1:02:29] when you look at what a sequel is it's a
[1:02:31] publisher broadcaster recorded work that
[1:02:33] continues a story
[1:02:35] or it develops a theme from an earlier
[1:02:38] story
[1:02:39] and it's something that takes place
[1:02:41] after or a result of an earlier event
[1:02:45] brother sisters that's what i'm talking
[1:02:47] about as
[1:02:48] christians in the life of christians
[1:02:50] today
[1:02:51] we have to be building up on the acts of
[1:02:54] our forefathers
[1:02:56] we have to be building upon the acts of
[1:02:58] our forefathers in the bible because
[1:03:00] when jesus went through the agony of the
[1:03:02] garden of gethsemane when he was
[1:03:04] tortured and beaten and hung up on the
[1:03:06] cross
[1:03:08] to die
[1:03:10] it was for your salvation
[1:03:13] sure it was for your salvation and we're
[1:03:15] so thankful for that salvation that
[1:03:16] everlasting life but i want you to know
[1:03:19] this morning that it was for more than
[1:03:21] just your salvation it was so that you
[1:03:24] can live with the benefits of the holy
[1:03:26] ghost
[1:03:28] have you ever thought about the benefits
[1:03:31] of the holy ghost
[1:03:33] when somebody dies there's a benefactor
[1:03:36] when i die what little of god or
[1:03:39] insurance money or whatever we have is
[1:03:41] going to go to the benefactor my wife
[1:03:44] when jesus died it was salvation but it
[1:03:47] was so much more than salvation it was
[1:03:49] power and authority it was deliverance
[1:03:52] and healing it was so that you can
[1:03:54] overcome the wickedness of this world
[1:03:58] that's what the benefactor was of the
[1:04:01] holy ghost
[1:04:04] jesus said in john
[1:04:06] 16 7
[1:04:09] nevertheless i tell you the truth that
[1:04:12] it's expedient for you that i go away
[1:04:15] for if i go not away the comforter will
[1:04:18] not come unto you but if i depart i will
[1:04:21] send him unto
[1:04:23] you
[1:04:25] brother sisters in the bible
[1:04:27] the word comforter
[1:04:30] relates to the holy spirit
[1:04:34] and this comforter was to come and do
[1:04:37] the very same works
[1:04:39] that the one who left it
[1:04:42] did
[1:04:44] put yourself there and think about jesus
[1:04:46] and think about this as we look at this
[1:04:48] as because jesus said if i don't go
[1:04:50] you can't have me
[1:04:54] and all along we've always thought in
[1:04:56] our minds and this has become a real
[1:04:57] hard reality to me that we need the
[1:05:00] cross of calvary for salvation and that
[1:05:02] is true
[1:05:04] but jesus says it's so much more than
[1:05:05] that because if i don't leave you can't
[1:05:08] have me i can't come back there's nobody
[1:05:11] for me to give myself to
[1:05:13] because it's christ in spirit
[1:05:16] he says i came from god i go to god a
[1:05:18] little while the world sees me no more
[1:05:20] that's the people
[1:05:22] that's the people of this world a little
[1:05:24] while i go and they see with me no more
[1:05:26] and the prophet said that's the worldly
[1:05:28] order he said yet you see me that's the
[1:05:31] church
[1:05:33] you see me i see him you see him because
[1:05:36] why we're the bride we're the church of
[1:05:38] jesus christ
[1:05:41] you see me for i'll be with you even in
[1:05:44] you to the end of the world the works
[1:05:46] that i do
[1:05:48] are you with me you shall do
[1:05:53] why is it we're afraid
[1:05:55] of the works
[1:05:58] come on church why are we afraid of the
[1:06:00] works i i you know i i'm talking about
[1:06:03] the silver and gold experiences why is
[1:06:05] it we're afraid of seeing god in action
[1:06:08] why is it we're afraid of seeing god in
[1:06:11] action when god could go and open
[1:06:14] blinded eyes
[1:06:15] he could unplug deaf ears he could look
[1:06:18] at it and say cancer be gone
[1:06:21] he could look at any kind of sickness
[1:06:22] nothing stood in his way
[1:06:24] he could calm the raging seas these are
[1:06:26] the things that our god did
[1:06:29] and
[1:06:30] greater greater than that shall you do
[1:06:35] but we begin to sit back and we begin to
[1:06:37] balk and we begin to think oh no i just
[1:06:39] don't know if if i if if that's for me
[1:06:42] but let me tell you it's time for the
[1:06:43] message to prove to the world what god
[1:06:46] does through his people
[1:06:50] it's a proven time
[1:06:52] the devil proves what he is
[1:06:56] let me tell you about it
[1:06:58] i had to go home or had to go to eastern
[1:07:00] to get western on friday he had to come
[1:07:02] pick up an airplane to take back the
[1:07:03] eastern for a test pray for him he's got
[1:07:06] a big exam tomorrow and
[1:07:08] uh
[1:07:08] but but he he was telling me about his
[1:07:10] first week on the college campus
[1:07:14] said dad eastern's different any college
[1:07:16] there is
[1:07:19] i said what do you mean he said it's
[1:07:20] just different
[1:07:22] he said the people i said son that's
[1:07:24] everywhere
[1:07:26] he said no i don't know
[1:07:28] he said there's men
[1:07:30] you know
[1:07:31] hey men his age at 19 20 24. he said
[1:07:35] they dressed in halter tops
[1:07:38] got their belly button pierced
[1:07:46] wearing cowboy boots up to here snake
[1:07:48] skin cowboy boots and shorty shorts
[1:07:53] built like a linebacker
[1:08:00] we laugh
[1:08:02] we laugh but
[1:08:04] the truth is that's a reality
[1:08:08] they're proven satan has proven who he
[1:08:11] is
[1:08:13] and many times we we're bashful
[1:08:17] christians find ourselves bashful
[1:08:20] we get ourselves many times in a corner
[1:08:23] and we kind of sit back and we just
[1:08:24] watch things happen around us we don't
[1:08:26] really get in there and say no no no
[1:08:28] this is not the way it's supposed to be
[1:08:29] you shouldn't be wearing that because
[1:08:31] this is not a pleasing to the god that
[1:08:33] we serve in america
[1:08:35] he's still our god of america
[1:08:39] and we sit back and we look at these
[1:08:40] things and we just kind of look back in
[1:08:42] awe
[1:08:44] but it's time for us to prove
[1:08:48] because if we're not careful
[1:08:51] will be what brother branham called a
[1:08:52] moralist
[1:08:54] a moralist what is a moralist you say he
[1:08:56] said let me give you a beautiful picture
[1:08:58] of it he said we would think today that
[1:09:00] it's a man that thinks he's going to
[1:09:02] heaven just because he quit gambling
[1:09:06] a morse is a man that thinks he's going
[1:09:08] to heaven just because he quit running
[1:09:09] around with women on his wife
[1:09:12] he said a moralist is a man who thinks
[1:09:14] he's going to heaven just because he
[1:09:16] stopped drinking
[1:09:18] he said a moralist is a person who on
[1:09:20] new year's day turned over a new leaf
[1:09:22] and they joined the church he said but
[1:09:23] you see he's really not converted
[1:09:27] that person is really not converted why
[1:09:29] does he say that because his life is not
[1:09:31] producing any other fruits
[1:09:34] and going to church
[1:09:36] uh-oh
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:39] he said you see he isn't really
[1:09:41] converted because he's a moralist
[1:09:44] he said and the devil is using moralists
[1:09:48] do y'all want me to stop
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:52] he says the devil is using moralist
[1:09:55] he said to make a foolish representation
[1:10:01] he said when really the real power of
[1:10:03] the living christ
[1:10:05] isn't there
[1:10:08] brothers and sisters that'll make us
[1:10:10] examine ourselves the morning
[1:10:12] and say where do i stand when i come in
[1:10:15] and sit in a pew
[1:10:17] is church just about being here on
[1:10:19] sunday morning church just about showing
[1:10:21] up to say hallelujah when the songs are
[1:10:24] saying or do i have the fruits of christ
[1:10:27] produced through me on a day-to-day
[1:10:29] basis am i the one going out here and
[1:10:31] people say man that man's got power i'm
[1:10:33] talking about power god given power and
[1:10:36] authority
[1:10:39] somebody asked me here no longer said
[1:10:41] why don't we see some of the things
[1:10:43] around us that other churches do
[1:10:52] where are we standing
[1:10:54] the only thing hindering god for moving
[1:10:55] is his people
[1:11:00] are we where we're supposed to be
[1:11:03] are we dedicated the way we're supposed
[1:11:05] to be dedicated because i'm afraid
[1:11:07] brothers and sisters around the masses
[1:11:09] there's a lot of people who've just
[1:11:11] become that moralist attitude
[1:11:14] they they've been around this message so
[1:11:16] long
[1:11:17] they're content to just be christians
[1:11:22] they're content just coming to church
[1:11:24] i've done my duty i've done my part i
[1:11:26] paid my tithes i give my offering
[1:11:30] they're content that jesus is their
[1:11:33] savior on calvary
[1:11:35] stay with me i'm not downplaying that
[1:11:37] don't think i'm downplaying that because
[1:11:39] it's the most important thing that's
[1:11:40] ever happened in your life is your
[1:11:41] salvation
[1:11:43] but there's more
[1:11:45] and people become to get content they
[1:11:47] think well i had to cut my hair in 25
[1:11:49] years
[1:11:56] i don't wear clothes i don't drink i
[1:11:57] don't smoke i don't wear the clothes i
[1:11:59] used to i don't cuss i don't i've
[1:12:01] cleaned out my closet i don't do those
[1:12:02] things i listen to message tape every
[1:12:05] day i read a message book and we call
[1:12:08] them
[1:12:09] believers
[1:12:13] don't we
[1:12:15] they do all those things and we call
[1:12:17] them believers
[1:12:19] i want to see believers in action god is
[1:12:22] looking for believers in action
[1:12:26] i'm sorry for being so hard this morning
[1:12:30] but i'm here to tell you that the
[1:12:32] messenger of this hour
[1:12:35] he come to bring you more than just
[1:12:37] mediocracy
[1:12:39] he come to bring you more than just not
[1:12:42] cutting your hair not not wearing makeup
[1:12:44] but you're wearing a dress and he come
[1:12:46] to bring you more that
[1:12:48] and god expects more from you than that
[1:12:52] the message of the hour is more than
[1:12:54] just being a good man
[1:12:56] there's a lot of good men out here
[1:12:58] there's a lot of good women i know a
[1:13:00] million of them
[1:13:03] but can they demonstrate the power and
[1:13:05] authority of the holy ghost
[1:13:10] you see the bride is special
[1:13:12] the bride is special
[1:13:14] what our scripture say when we first
[1:13:16] started i knew you before you were
[1:13:17] formed in the womb
[1:13:21] i chose you
[1:13:24] brothers and sisters i want to be
[1:13:26] all that god
[1:13:28] wants me to be
[1:13:30] i want to be more than
[1:13:32] than just a mediocre christian
[1:13:37] and if we're not living under the power
[1:13:39] and authority of the holy ghost
[1:13:41] i feel like we're diminishing and we're
[1:13:44] downplaying the death burial and
[1:13:45] resurrection
[1:13:46] of jesus christ
[1:13:49] we're downplaying it because we're
[1:13:51] saying he's good enough
[1:13:53] to die for my sins
[1:13:55] but i'm not good enough to perform the
[1:13:58] acts he did
[1:14:00] when the scripture says we should
[1:14:08] turn with me to john 15.
[1:14:13] yo when you say statements like that
[1:14:14] you've got to prove it
[1:14:18] so john 15 we're going to prove we're on
[1:14:20] proving grounds
[1:14:27] john 15 i am the
[1:14:29] true vine
[1:14:30] and my father is the husbandman
[1:14:33] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:14:35] fruit he taketh away
[1:14:38] see how important it is that we bear
[1:14:39] fruit and the first statement there
[1:14:42] if you're not bearing fruit
[1:14:46] you're gathered
[1:14:48] you're gathered together with the things
[1:14:49] that are dead
[1:14:51] what the prophets say about our
[1:14:53] denominational churches they're dead
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:14:59] if you're not bearing fruit
[1:15:02] you're going to be gathered up
[1:15:04] he says and ever and it says in every
[1:15:05] branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it
[1:15:08] and make it bring forth more fruit
[1:15:11] oh boy that's good that ought to make us
[1:15:13] get up run around and shout and have a
[1:15:14] little pentecostal experience right
[1:15:16] there that the more you do for god he'll
[1:15:19] prune you and make you grow a little
[1:15:20] bigger a little better a little stronger
[1:15:23] a little more authority he'll give you a
[1:15:25] little more confidence
[1:15:31] now ye are clinging through the word
[1:15:33] which i've spoken abide in me
[1:15:36] notice abide in me and i in you as the
[1:15:39] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:15:41] except it abide in the vine
[1:15:44] no more
[1:15:45] can ye accept ye abide in me i am the
[1:15:48] vine ye are the branches
[1:15:50] he that abideth in me and i and him the
[1:15:53] same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:15:55] for without me
[1:15:57] you can do
[1:15:59] nothing
[1:16:01] you see when i talk about power and
[1:16:04] authority i'm not talking about
[1:16:05] something that you or i manufacture
[1:16:09] i'm talking about something that's
[1:16:10] poured out and given to us
[1:16:13] through the holy ghost
[1:16:15] a life that's lived with the holy ghost
[1:16:21] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:16:24] forth as a branch and get them gathered
[1:16:26] and cast into a fire and they're burned
[1:16:28] if you abide in me my words abide in you
[1:16:30] you shall ask what ye will and it shall
[1:16:33] be done
[1:16:36] authority
[1:16:39] herein is my father glorified that ye
[1:16:41] bear much fruit
[1:16:44] if you want to glorify god
[1:16:47] don't just come into the church and
[1:16:48] praise and and worship just when it's
[1:16:51] when it's sunday morning in worship time
[1:16:53] don't just that's not what we're talking
[1:16:55] about glorifying god but he says if you
[1:16:56] want to glorify god bear much fruit
[1:17:01] do things that god done
[1:17:06] as the father has loved me that's all i
[1:17:08] loved you continuing my love
[1:17:11] i want to skip on down here we came to
[1:17:13] verse 15.
[1:17:15] henceforth i call you not servants
[1:17:19] you're no longer a slave
[1:17:22] you're not a slave to jesus
[1:17:25] he says no for the servant knoweth not
[1:17:27] what he what his lord doeth but i have
[1:17:30] called you
[1:17:31] friend
[1:17:35] there's no greater friend
[1:17:37] than the lovely jesus
[1:17:40] i have called you friends for all things
[1:17:42] that i have heard of my father i have
[1:17:44] made known unto you
[1:17:46] so this is not something new
[1:17:49] what god is trying to do in this last
[1:17:51] hour in this last day is nothing new to
[1:17:54] us he's made it known to us that's why
[1:17:56] we have a messenger in this hour
[1:17:59] and so many times we downplay that and
[1:18:00] take it for granted we know things that
[1:18:03] baffles
[1:18:05] scholars
[1:18:09] listen to 16. you have not chosen me
[1:18:12] but i have chosen
[1:18:14] you
[1:18:18] listen to the next part real important
[1:18:20] and ordained you
[1:18:22] or that word ordained means he's decreed
[1:18:25] holy orders upon you
[1:18:29] he's given you a decree
[1:18:31] god
[1:18:32] says i've ordained you i chose you i
[1:18:35] picked you i've chosen you and i've
[1:18:37] ordained you that with this holy order
[1:18:39] you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:18:43] you shall go and bring forth fruit and
[1:18:45] that your fruit shall remain
[1:18:47] god's fruit don't rot
[1:18:50] god's fruit stays
[1:18:52] plush and it stays healthy and it's a
[1:18:54] good god-given uh uh fruit that goes out
[1:18:58] in it and nourishes people and it
[1:19:00] nurtures people
[1:19:02] it's a healthy fruit
[1:19:04] and he said that you you that my fruit
[1:19:06] that your fruit shall remain that
[1:19:08] whatsoever you shall ask in my father's
[1:19:10] name
[1:19:15] we live below
[1:19:18] whatever you ask in my father's name
[1:19:20] he
[1:19:21] we may give it to you
[1:19:25] brothers and sisters that's christ
[1:19:27] granting the power and authority to have
[1:19:30] and it's so freely given but yet we
[1:19:32] don't use it
[1:19:35] what good does it do if we just set it
[1:19:37] on a shelf
[1:19:42] if there's a need for a healing
[1:19:44] and i set it on this shelf
[1:19:47] and i watch those around me
[1:19:49] that are suffering
[1:19:52] what good does it do me to
[1:19:54] leave
[1:19:55] the holy spirit of healing on that shelf
[1:19:59] remember silver and gold have a knot
[1:20:02] i might not be able to pay you medical
[1:20:03] bills i might not be able to send you to
[1:20:05] the best doctors
[1:20:07] but if i've got the spirit of god and
[1:20:08] i've got healing on this shelf
[1:20:11] i'll give it to you
[1:20:14] i'll give it to you are you with me
[1:20:21] well i know you say well jesus said that
[1:20:23] but
[1:20:24] i feel like it's just for another day
[1:20:27] i feel like it was just for the apostles
[1:20:30] sometimes i just don't feel it
[1:20:33] brother sister that's why we don't go on
[1:20:34] feelings
[1:20:37] that's why we don't go on feelings
[1:20:38] because
[1:20:41] feelings will confuse you
[1:20:44] because satan works in that realm
[1:20:48] when god looks at you and say go lay
[1:20:50] your hands on that person and satan says
[1:20:53] you can't do it
[1:20:55] don't tell me it's never happened to you
[1:20:56] because it has
[1:20:59] something tells you go witness to this
[1:21:01] person i can't do it i don't know the
[1:21:03] word
[1:21:05] that's what satan tells you
[1:21:07] you know more than you think you know
[1:21:10] it's better to obey and just let god
[1:21:12] take control
[1:21:14] that's the best thing you can do that's
[1:21:16] the best sermon that's ever preached if
[1:21:17] you'll just obey god listen to god and
[1:21:20] do what he tells you to do and just let
[1:21:22] him take control
[1:21:25] you ask any preacher they can study they
[1:21:26] can study they can put it all together
[1:21:28] but the best messages they'll ever
[1:21:30] preach and the ones they feel are more
[1:21:31] effective than any is when they get out
[1:21:33] of the way they step aside from their
[1:21:35] notes and they just say what god says
[1:21:39] it's when god begins to minister yes he
[1:21:42] lays thoughts on our mind he thoughts in
[1:21:44] our hearts but i love it when we branch
[1:21:46] and deviate from our nodes because that
[1:21:48] means somebody's pulling somebody's
[1:21:50] needing something from god
[1:21:54] somebody this morning needs more power
[1:21:57] somebody this morning needs to know the
[1:22:00] authority that they have laying inside
[1:22:02] of them
[1:22:03] and to grasp the reality of that that
[1:22:06] authority
[1:22:12] we can't go on feelings
[1:22:16] you say i just can't do it
[1:22:18] i'm going to tell you satan's lie to you
[1:22:20] enough
[1:22:22] because the word says you were built for
[1:22:24] this day
[1:22:27] do you realize that
[1:22:28] you look at this this portrait on the
[1:22:30] wall right here this is church age after
[1:22:33] church age after church age after church
[1:22:35] age after church age
[1:22:37] the world's been in existence we know
[1:22:38] for more than 2000 years
[1:22:41] right
[1:22:43] why didn't god choose you to walk on the
[1:22:44] road of a mess
[1:22:46] wasn't for you
[1:22:49] why didn't god choose you to go through
[1:22:51] the dark ages
[1:22:52] was it for you
[1:22:54] god said i need a bride in the last day
[1:22:58] that will be authority and power and
[1:23:00] take my word and show the world that i
[1:23:03] am alive
[1:23:05] that's what you were built for
[1:23:10] the prophet said the world is wanting to
[1:23:13] see
[1:23:13] jesus
[1:23:15] the world is wanting to see jesus and
[1:23:17] jesus said i am the vine you are the
[1:23:19] branches and the branch bears record of
[1:23:22] the vine because it draws the energy and
[1:23:24] the life from that vine
[1:23:28] it's nothing we produce
[1:23:32] it's
[1:23:33] nothing we manufacture
[1:23:35] you have to understand a little bit
[1:23:37] about the way grapes and vines are grown
[1:23:39] you have a vine that comes up you got
[1:23:40] roots and the vine comes up
[1:23:43] and then that vine will put out little
[1:23:44] leaders little branches off the sides
[1:23:49] that branch is no good
[1:23:51] if the main vine is no good
[1:23:54] you let some rot get involved into that
[1:23:57] vine
[1:23:58] that branch will begin to die you'll
[1:24:00] never have a one ounce of fruit
[1:24:03] but as long as that vine lives
[1:24:06] let me tell you god's alive
[1:24:08] and as long as that vine lives and we
[1:24:11] are the branches and we begin to to pull
[1:24:13] and saturate ourselves with the
[1:24:15] nutrients and the wisdom and the
[1:24:16] knowledge and the power that comes up
[1:24:18] out of that vine
[1:24:20] these branches said it here will have to
[1:24:23] bear fruit
[1:24:25] the fruit hangs off the branches
[1:24:31] he said listen now
[1:24:34] if he said because it draws energy and
[1:24:36] life from the vine he said well the
[1:24:37] first vine the first branch that came
[1:24:40] from this they wrote a book of acts
[1:24:42] behind that branch
[1:24:44] he's talking about peter and john
[1:24:47] all the apostles and the disciples that
[1:24:49] was left behind and was there on the day
[1:24:51] of pentecost he's talking about the ones
[1:24:54] that go out there and said silver and
[1:24:55] gold have i not
[1:24:57] but what i have i give thee that's who
[1:24:58] he's talking about that was that first
[1:25:00] book of acts behind that branch he said
[1:25:03] and we see the way the holy spirit acted
[1:25:05] in that first church
[1:25:06] the church of pentecost he said we
[1:25:09] believe that if the original vine ever
[1:25:11] puts forth another branch
[1:25:14] you know what it's going to do he said
[1:25:16] it'll write another book of acts behind
[1:25:18] it
[1:25:21] because it's the same life
[1:25:24] coming from the same vine
[1:25:27] god don't change
[1:25:30] and he says and if that first branch put
[1:25:31] forth a bunch of grapes
[1:25:35] we're going to have a bunch of grapes
[1:25:37] he said but if you find it's got
[1:25:39] watermelons growing or pumpkins or
[1:25:41] cucumber
[1:25:43] you know that that is not the true vine
[1:25:47] that's the false vine
[1:25:51] i want to remind you this continuation
[1:25:53] of god
[1:25:57] this continuation of god in action
[1:26:00] we send in the old testament to the new
[1:26:02] testament to testament to matthew mark
[1:26:04] luke and john and we go over and write
[1:26:06] the
[1:26:06] backs did god ever change
[1:26:09] from them till now
[1:26:13] remember what i told you when we talk
[1:26:14] about jeremiah and god said i am
[1:26:17] he said i'm going to speak and i am in
[1:26:20] the book of exodus chapter 3 we got
[1:26:23] moses
[1:26:24] god has come down and began to speak to
[1:26:26] moses now
[1:26:27] and he says moses you're going to go and
[1:26:29] you're going to deliver my people
[1:26:32] you're going to go down there and i've
[1:26:34] heard my people's cry and i whether you
[1:26:37] like it or not moses i picked you
[1:26:41] i can't do it lord moses you're built
[1:26:44] for it
[1:26:46] are you with me
[1:26:48] how am i going to do this lord how am i
[1:26:50] going to do this
[1:26:51] who am i
[1:26:53] that's what we all have to ask ourselves
[1:26:56] who am i
[1:26:57] i'm nothing
[1:26:59] that's what the word said we're nothing
[1:27:00] without god
[1:27:02] and moses says he realized that who am i
[1:27:04] i'm nobody god
[1:27:06] that i should go down to pharaoh and i
[1:27:08] can't bring those children out of egypt
[1:27:11] and god said
[1:27:12] certainly
[1:27:16] i love the way it's written
[1:27:19] certainly
[1:27:20] i will be with thee
[1:27:24] for i have sent thee when thou has
[1:27:27] brought forth the people out of egypt
[1:27:29] you will serve god on this mountain and
[1:27:31] moses
[1:27:32] listen to all this he begins to look and
[1:27:34] he says
[1:27:35] when all this happens and and you say to
[1:27:37] me and they come and ask me who sent you
[1:27:39] down here to get us moses
[1:27:42] who do i tell them
[1:27:44] who am i going to tell them that you are
[1:27:47] he said tell them that i am
[1:27:49] that i am
[1:27:52] and he said thou shalt say unto the
[1:27:54] children of israel i am have sent
[1:27:58] me
[1:27:58] unto you
[1:28:01] the same i am that spoke to the prophet
[1:28:04] jeremiah
[1:28:06] the same i am that says i am greater in
[1:28:09] you than you are in the world
[1:28:12] the same i am
[1:28:14] john 6 jesus feeds over 5 000 people
[1:28:18] and right after that miracle he tells
[1:28:20] them
[1:28:21] i am
[1:28:22] the bread of life
[1:28:25] i am the bread of life and he who shall
[1:28:27] comes to me shall never hunger and they
[1:28:29] will never thirst
[1:28:31] i am
[1:28:34] jesus his disciples are at the temple
[1:28:36] and they're celebrating a festival of
[1:28:38] lights and
[1:28:40] jesus comes in there and and jesus
[1:28:42] announced
[1:28:45] i am
[1:28:46] the light of the world
[1:28:50] who is this i am
[1:28:52] it's god
[1:28:54] it's god in us it's god and his people
[1:28:57] it's god in jeremiah it's god and moses
[1:28:59] it's god in jesus and it's god in you
[1:29:01] and i
[1:29:03] i am the light of the world and he who
[1:29:05] follows me shall never walk in darkness
[1:29:10] they're looking out over the hills
[1:29:12] the shepherd are heard in the sheep
[1:29:17] and jesus says i'm the gate
[1:29:21] i'm the gate for the sheep
[1:29:23] and whoever enters through me will be
[1:29:25] saved
[1:29:28] he will come in and i and go out and
[1:29:30] find pasture
[1:29:32] i am
[1:29:35] jesus goes on to say i am
[1:29:38] the good shepherd
[1:29:41] i am the good shepherd the good shepherd
[1:29:43] lays down his life
[1:29:45] for his sheep
[1:29:52] you want more
[1:29:54] when jesus comes up to the tomb of
[1:29:56] lazarus mary and martha crying
[1:30:00] where have you been god
[1:30:02] why didn't he show up if you would have
[1:30:03] just been here
[1:30:05] if you would just come my brother would
[1:30:07] still be alive
[1:30:09] and he sits there and he looks at the
[1:30:11] situation lazarus dead and he declared i
[1:30:14] am the resurrection
[1:30:19] and the life
[1:30:21] i am and he who believes in me will live
[1:30:28] at the last upper
[1:30:30] jesus warns his apostles
[1:30:33] about the coming of rest and the death
[1:30:35] and he's trying to tell them hey things
[1:30:37] are fixing to get a little bit tricky
[1:30:38] around here
[1:30:39] better have your head on straight
[1:30:40] brothers because things are fixing
[1:30:42] change
[1:30:44] and he begins to tell them and they just
[1:30:46] can't understand it and thomas says we
[1:30:48] don't know where you're going jesus
[1:30:50] we don't know where you're going how how
[1:30:52] can we possibly know that way that
[1:30:54] you're talking about you're trying to
[1:30:55] tell us some way to go but how do we
[1:30:57] know and jesus looks at this opportunity
[1:30:59] he says i am
[1:31:01] the way
[1:31:03] i am the truth
[1:31:04] and i am the life
[1:31:07] i am
[1:31:14] you say well how does this apply to us
[1:31:18] what in these everyday events
[1:31:21] he went to lunch fed some people
[1:31:25] went to a funeral
[1:31:32] leading a group of people at work
[1:31:35] i am
[1:31:38] i am
[1:31:40] jesus says his
[1:31:41] last recorded i am statement after the
[1:31:43] last supper
[1:31:46] these men were no doubt probably walking
[1:31:48] around the upper room and
[1:31:50] after they just got done eating and it
[1:31:52] was the last supper there and
[1:31:53] they're walking around and they go down
[1:31:55] into the garden where jesus would later
[1:31:57] be arrested and
[1:31:58] during that walk
[1:32:01] they're walking down through there and
[1:32:02] here is a prominent symbol
[1:32:05] and over into the going into the
[1:32:07] into the entrance of the temple
[1:32:09] they had a golden wire that was threaded
[1:32:12] golden wire had beef hanging off of it
[1:32:14] golden beets and it was to symbolize a
[1:32:17] golden grapevine
[1:32:19] and jesus then takes this opportunity to
[1:32:22] sit there he points to that golden
[1:32:24] grapevine and he says i am the
[1:32:26] true vine
[1:32:31] jesus is usually something they're
[1:32:32] familiar with
[1:32:34] grapes was something that's still to
[1:32:36] this day is is grown prominently into in
[1:32:38] that land over there grapes grow easy
[1:32:40] over there grapes grow healthy they make
[1:32:42] wine some of the best wines uh that
[1:32:45] connoisseurs look for in the world come
[1:32:46] from right there in that region where
[1:32:48] jesus was and he looks up over the
[1:32:50] temple and points to those golden beads
[1:32:51] and says i am the true vine
[1:32:59] i am the true vine
[1:33:01] these grapes these grapevines are used
[1:33:04] as three types of symbols
[1:33:06] it represents past and present and
[1:33:08] future
[1:33:09] so do you see some kind of a correlation
[1:33:11] there that jesus christ is the same
[1:33:13] yesterday today and forever
[1:33:17] and as we look at this the past vine
[1:33:19] notice what happens here the path that's
[1:33:21] a little history for you the past vine
[1:33:23] symbolizes
[1:33:25] israel as a choice vine you know israel
[1:33:28] was god's people
[1:33:30] they were his own flesh and blood so to
[1:33:32] speak
[1:33:33] and so the israel they were important to
[1:33:35] him but what did that vine constantly do
[1:33:38] that vine constantly disappointed the
[1:33:40] vine dresser
[1:33:43] they couldn't be obedient
[1:33:45] they couldn't abide they couldn't stay
[1:33:47] in the word they deviated here and there
[1:33:50] and so it says that they were wild
[1:33:52] grapes
[1:33:53] have you ever tried a wild grape
[1:33:56] they will lock your jaws
[1:34:00] sour
[1:34:02] bitter
[1:34:04] they'll make you pucker up
[1:34:07] worse than persimmon
[1:34:09] wild grapes
[1:34:11] then the future vines symbolize the last
[1:34:14] days on earth
[1:34:17] ripe for god's judgment and wrath
[1:34:21] where you think we're at
[1:34:24] we're in these last days where it
[1:34:26] symbolizes
[1:34:28] the wrath of god is upon us
[1:34:31] this land cannot continue to disappoint
[1:34:36] and god not do something about it
[1:34:39] somebody said something to me the other
[1:34:41] day and
[1:34:42] i just remember how i responded to it i
[1:34:44] don't really remember what we were
[1:34:45] talking about forgive me for that
[1:34:47] but they were talking about i do know
[1:34:49] what we're talking about we were talking
[1:34:50] about uh
[1:34:52] what is normal
[1:34:56] can anybody give me a definition of
[1:34:58] normal
[1:35:00] in this day we're living in think about
[1:35:02] the college situation i just told you is
[1:35:04] anybody anything what is normal
[1:35:07] we'd like to look around and say we're
[1:35:08] normal
[1:35:10] but she was talking about she said you
[1:35:12] know the colleges set kids up
[1:35:16] to try to pull them in they better be
[1:35:17] strong when they go
[1:35:19] is what she was trying to say they
[1:35:20] better be strong when they go because
[1:35:22] the colleges are setting them up
[1:35:24] to go into this abnormal mind and state
[1:35:27] and draw them in to pull them into that
[1:35:30] that little circle
[1:35:32] and she said
[1:35:34] she said something about how how it must
[1:35:36] affect god and i said
[1:35:38] you know how it must
[1:35:40] hurt god's heart
[1:35:44] and when i said that i thought about
[1:35:46] what i said it's one of those things i
[1:35:47] said it came out really before i thought
[1:35:49] about it but then when i said it i
[1:35:50] thought
[1:35:51] how true it is
[1:35:53] that god did so much for the world
[1:35:57] he gave his only begotten son
[1:36:00] he gives us benefit after benefit after
[1:36:02] benefit and all we have to do is come to
[1:36:05] him and accept him
[1:36:07] and people turn faster
[1:36:10] than a jet engine from him
[1:36:13] and i thought how that must hurt his
[1:36:15] heart
[1:36:16] as he looks over the banister of time
[1:36:20] and says what
[1:36:21] is this
[1:36:24] what is this
[1:36:26] it's ready
[1:36:28] for judgment
[1:36:31] and the present vine on that
[1:36:34] representation
[1:36:36] is the lord jesus christ
[1:36:39] jesus said i am the vine you're the
[1:36:40] branches and if a man abides in me and
[1:36:42] on him he will bear much fruit apart
[1:36:44] from me you can do nothing
[1:36:47] so an important thing we need to look at
[1:36:48] here if we look at this vine
[1:36:50] and where this teaching goes is the word
[1:36:53] abide
[1:36:54] because the word abide was used 11 times
[1:36:57] in 11 verses it's a pretty important
[1:36:59] word and so what it's trying to tell us
[1:37:01] is if we abide with jesus
[1:37:04] the branch abiding with the vine
[1:37:08] we're together we're growing we're
[1:37:10] fruitful
[1:37:12] but if you do not abide
[1:37:14] with the vine
[1:37:16] you're gonna die
[1:37:21] you take a branch on a tree
[1:37:23] they've done some work behind my house
[1:37:25] and one of the my favorite trees it's a
[1:37:28] little little white oak tree and it's
[1:37:29] just a little bushy pretty little thing
[1:37:31] and they took the track hole around and
[1:37:33] swung around and hit two branches
[1:37:36] you think they got green leaves on them
[1:37:37] today
[1:37:39] brother jeff
[1:37:40] no
[1:37:41] i got to get my pruning saw out and cut
[1:37:44] them off because they will never be
[1:37:46] green again
[1:37:48] because they don't abide anymore into
[1:37:51] the trunk where the life given material
[1:37:53] comes from
[1:37:54] and jesus said if you abide in me
[1:37:57] and i in you you're going to be fruitful
[1:37:59] you're going to put out a lot of fruit
[1:38:05] so i mean studying meditating on the
[1:38:07] word getting in god's word abiding in
[1:38:10] christ reading studying spending time
[1:38:13] praying focusing on god
[1:38:16] drawn from that life
[1:38:23] we're told to abide
[1:38:26] because it's something we can do
[1:38:29] or not do
[1:38:32] like i said jesus said you're not
[1:38:34] servants you're not slaves
[1:38:38] you can abide in me
[1:38:40] are you going to choose to not abide in
[1:38:42] me
[1:38:44] but the word clearly tells us that if
[1:38:47] you're unfruitful if you're not a biden
[1:38:49] that branch is going to be taken away
[1:38:51] like i said about the tree i'm going to
[1:38:52] cut it off because it'll never bear
[1:38:54] fruit again it'll never put out an acre
[1:38:56] and it'll never put out another leaf
[1:38:59] and if you're not abiding in christ
[1:39:02] you may come to church
[1:39:04] you may go to meetings you may sing
[1:39:07] specials
[1:39:08] i'm not don't think i'm pointing fingers
[1:39:10] that anybody does those things i'm
[1:39:12] making an example
[1:39:14] but if you're not putting out fruit
[1:39:18] jesus
[1:39:20] jesus is fruit
[1:39:22] that is an example of the life he lived
[1:39:27] did you ever
[1:39:29] think of a point or a place where
[1:39:32] jesus sang specials
[1:39:35] did you ever think of a place where
[1:39:36] jesus sat down and played the guitar
[1:39:40] i can't recall it
[1:39:43] we need those things i love those things
[1:39:45] it's part of our worship it's part of
[1:39:46] who we are as christians to be able to
[1:39:48] worship and praise but jesus is looking
[1:39:51] for
[1:39:52] fruits
[1:39:53] clusters of grapes
[1:40:01] if we don't abide in christ
[1:40:05] the consequences are what we would say
[1:40:07] is terrible
[1:40:10] if you're not abiding in christ if you
[1:40:12] if you want to see your world fall apart
[1:40:15] just stop abiding in christ
[1:40:18] if you want to see your marriage on the
[1:40:20] rocks quit coming to church
[1:40:24] if you want to see your children go the
[1:40:25] ways of the world quit bringing them to
[1:40:27] church
[1:40:29] if you want to see your uh your job and
[1:40:31] your career go to the pits quit going to
[1:40:34] church
[1:40:36] because i tell you i don't know where i
[1:40:37] would be without god
[1:40:40] i was thinking just here the other day
[1:40:41] and i was sitting there thinking uh how
[1:40:44] i'm 46 years old
[1:40:46] and i've been through what i think would
[1:40:48] be some some rough times in my life
[1:40:50] maybe it's not rough in yours but i've
[1:40:52] been in as times we've been in financial
[1:40:54] distress and we didn't know where in the
[1:40:55] world was going to get money
[1:40:57] there's been times when i when i didn't
[1:40:58] know about my job i didn't know what
[1:41:00] what i was going to be doing there's
[1:41:02] been times when when maybe we had a
[1:41:04] little squabble and we just wonder what
[1:41:06] in the world are we doing here as a
[1:41:08] couple
[1:41:11] well i'm glad somebody's been there
[1:41:14] but i thought i was thinking like laying
[1:41:16] there thinking and all my 46 years i
[1:41:18] could not think of one time that god
[1:41:20] didn't bring me through it
[1:41:24] it's nothing i manufactured
[1:41:27] but i was just living for christ
[1:41:30] in my darkest times when i didn't know
[1:41:32] where church was going to take me
[1:41:34] i still live for god i never lost my
[1:41:37] love for god and i thank him for that my
[1:41:39] family never lost their love or god we
[1:41:42] didn't know we're up from down as far as
[1:41:44] where we were going or what we were
[1:41:45] supposed to do
[1:41:47] but god
[1:41:48] never left us
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:54] the fruit comes from abiding
[1:41:56] abiding in god obeying in god
[1:42:02] obeying god and connecting with christ
[1:42:04] vines and branches they have to connect
[1:42:06] they have to stay together
[1:42:08] and god says you're not a slave you're a
[1:42:10] friend
[1:42:12] and when we talk about a friendship what
[1:42:13] is a friendship a friendship is pers
[1:42:16] personal
[1:42:17] a friendship reciprocates
[1:42:24] he gives you the option to abide
[1:42:27] and obey
[1:42:30] right
[1:42:31] and he wants that to be reciprocating he
[1:42:34] wants it to come back and forth and back
[1:42:36] and forth
[1:42:37] because god only shares his plans with
[1:42:40] his friends
[1:42:49] i don't even have to say nothing you
[1:42:50] know what i'm talking about
[1:42:52] god shares his plan with those he loves
[1:42:55] the most those he pulls up into his
[1:42:58] bosom and says abide with me my love
[1:43:06] you know a person who abides finds it
[1:43:08] easier to obey
[1:43:12] and a person who is obedient is more
[1:43:13] comfortable abiding
[1:43:16] think about that
[1:43:18] but if you want a conflict in your life
[1:43:21] just begin to disobey god and you'll
[1:43:23] find you're not comfortable abiding
[1:43:24] anymore
[1:43:26] and god's not a comfortable comfortable
[1:43:27] with you trying to come to him when
[1:43:29] you're not obedient to his word
[1:43:32] let me tell you brothers and sisters you
[1:43:33] want you want your life to change quit
[1:43:35] abiding in god quit obeying god and see
[1:43:37] if he don't turn the spigot off
[1:43:41] oh you may cruise along for a while
[1:43:44] but eventually it's going to catch up
[1:43:46] with you
[1:43:47] let me tell you god and abiding in god
[1:43:50] and serving god and praying to god and
[1:43:52] being full of power and authority that
[1:43:54] god has given us is more important than
[1:43:56] any job you'll ever have
[1:43:59] oh we like money sure we do
[1:44:01] money buys us nice things money buys us
[1:44:04] nice clothes and cars and houses
[1:44:06] but if you've got that money and you're
[1:44:07] not abiding in christ
[1:44:09] it's gonna burn
[1:44:15] you want to find the person brothers and
[1:44:17] sisters that's the happiest person on
[1:44:18] the face of the earth
[1:44:20] find the one who's abiding and obeying
[1:44:23] and you'll find a person that's filled
[1:44:25] with joy and love and peace and
[1:44:28] gentleness and meekness you'll find
[1:44:29] somebody that's living every bit of this
[1:44:31] statue of a perfect man you say well we
[1:44:33] can't do it yes we can because you're
[1:44:34] called to do it you're built to do it
[1:44:37] don't tell me you can't do it because
[1:44:38] god says you can
[1:44:41] well i'm just down here at the very
[1:44:43] bottom i don't have enough faith to
[1:44:46] start my car in the mornings i have to
[1:44:48] put it on jumper cables
[1:44:50] you're not built for that
[1:44:52] quit talking such nonsense
[1:44:54] stand on the word of god and where it
[1:44:56] says greater is he that is in me say it
[1:44:58] with me than he that is in the world
[1:45:08] i want to read one more scripture if we
[1:45:09] could kind of lengthy if we could mark
[1:45:12] 16
[1:45:13] because mark 16
[1:45:15] is often overlooked
[1:45:20] but mark 16 is the foundation
[1:45:23] when you talk about the book of acts you
[1:45:24] talk about the book of revelations
[1:45:27] mark
[1:45:28] plays a very important part
[1:45:31] it says and when the sabbath was passed
[1:45:33] mary magdalene and mary the other mother
[1:45:35] the mother of james and salome had
[1:45:37] brought sweet spices that they may come
[1:45:39] to anoint him
[1:45:41] and very early in the morning the first
[1:45:42] day of the week they came unto the
[1:45:44] sepulcher at the rising of the sun
[1:45:46] and they said amongst themselves who
[1:45:48] shall roll us away the stone from the
[1:45:50] door of the sepulcher
[1:45:52] and when they looked they saw that the
[1:45:54] stone was rolled away
[1:45:56] for it would be great and entering into
[1:45:59] the sepulcher they saw a young man
[1:46:00] sitting on the right side clothed
[1:46:03] and a long white garment and they were
[1:46:05] frightened
[1:46:06] one of the other one of the others i
[1:46:08] don't know which one i'd have to look it
[1:46:09] up but one of the others says it when
[1:46:11] they come there the stone was rolled
[1:46:12] away and there was an angel sitting on
[1:46:14] that stone and it rested on that stone
[1:46:18] and when i thought about that i thought
[1:46:19] you know there's something special about
[1:46:21] when satan tries to push stuff into your
[1:46:24] life
[1:46:25] and he tries to bind you and hold you
[1:46:27] down with the weight of the world and
[1:46:29] hold the stone against you where you
[1:46:30] can't get out
[1:46:32] there's something special that says god
[1:46:34] can move that stone out of the way
[1:46:36] and you can rest on it
[1:46:42] entering into the sepulchre they saw a
[1:46:44] young man sit on the right side clothed
[1:46:46] in a long white garment and they were
[1:46:47] frightened
[1:46:48] and he said unto them be not a
[1:46:50] frightened you seek jesus of neither as
[1:46:52] nazareth which was crucified and has
[1:46:53] risen he's not here
[1:47:00] he's not here
[1:47:03] one place that says why do you seek the
[1:47:04] dead amongst the living
[1:47:07] why are you seeking these why are you
[1:47:08] seeking he's not here
[1:47:13] why are you sick and living among the
[1:47:14] dead i'm sorry
[1:47:17] check me see
[1:47:20] but go and tell your disciples and peter
[1:47:23] that he goes before you into galilee
[1:47:25] there you shall see him and
[1:47:27] he said and as he said unto you
[1:47:30] they went out quickly and fled from the
[1:47:31] sepulcher they trembled and was amazed
[1:47:33] and they said any said they anything to
[1:47:36] any man and they were afraid and when
[1:47:38] jesus was risen early the first day of
[1:47:40] the week he appeared first in mary
[1:47:42] magdalene whom he had cast out seven
[1:47:44] devils
[1:47:46] and when she had went and told him that
[1:47:48] that he that he had been
[1:47:50] that been with him as they mourned and
[1:47:53] wept
[1:47:54] and they when they had heard that he was
[1:47:56] alive had been seen of her believe not
[1:48:02] somebody's not abiding in jesus
[1:48:06] because he told them i'm fixing to go
[1:48:08] away from here because if i don't
[1:48:10] the comforter cannot come
[1:48:12] i'm fixing to leave this place
[1:48:15] and and you're going to come looking for
[1:48:16] me in three days i'm going to raise up
[1:48:20] and they're still looking for him
[1:48:24] and after he appeared in another form
[1:48:26] into two of them as they walked and went
[1:48:28] into the country they went and told him
[1:48:30] to the unto the residue neither the
[1:48:32] neighbor neither believed they them
[1:48:34] afterward he appeared unto the heaven as
[1:48:36] they said it meet and upbraided him with
[1:48:38] their unbelief and hardness of heart
[1:48:41] because they believed not them which had
[1:48:44] seen him after he was risen
[1:48:47] and he said unto them go into all the
[1:48:49] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:48:52] creature
[1:48:54] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:48:56] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:48:58] be
[1:48:58] damned what does he say next
[1:49:02] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:49:04] believe
[1:49:08] you say i can't do it
[1:49:10] in my name
[1:49:12] in jesus name
[1:49:14] they shall cast out devils
[1:49:16] in jesus name they shall speak with new
[1:49:19] tongues in jesus name they shall take up
[1:49:21] serpents
[1:49:23] in jesus name they shall drink any
[1:49:24] deadly thing and it shall not hurt them
[1:49:26] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:49:28] they shall recover
[1:49:30] that's in jesus name
[1:49:36] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[1:49:38] them he was received up into heaven and
[1:49:40] said on the right hand of god and they
[1:49:42] went forth and preached everywhere the
[1:49:44] lord working with them and confirming
[1:49:47] the word
[1:49:49] with
[1:49:50] signs
[1:49:54] signs
[1:49:58] i said well it's going to be a terror
[1:50:00] terrible day for the devil
[1:50:03] let me tell you what i have come to the
[1:50:04] conclusion and what i have i've learned
[1:50:06] to find
[1:50:07] joy and i've learned to find pleasure
[1:50:10] and i have learned to find peace
[1:50:13] in putting the devil in his place
[1:50:16] the older i get the bolder i get
[1:50:21] i don't know if it goes with everybody
[1:50:23] i'm sure it does that preaches
[1:50:26] but
[1:50:27] i'm just an anxious person
[1:50:29] okay
[1:50:30] i'm not i'm not claiming anything i'm
[1:50:31] not confessing but my spirit my nature
[1:50:33] isn't that anxious
[1:50:36] and i begin to dwell and think and try
[1:50:38] to put things pieces together and and we
[1:50:40] got you know in my life right now we got
[1:50:42] this going on and that going on and
[1:50:44] weston going to school and we're worried
[1:50:45] about working on this work and it's just
[1:50:47] constantly just back and forth back and
[1:50:49] forth and the devil was just beating me
[1:50:51] up and said you're never going to
[1:50:53] accomplish any of this
[1:50:55] you don't have time
[1:50:58] you're not going to be able to
[1:50:59] accomplish any of this you're not going
[1:51:01] to pull any of this off and so what does
[1:51:03] that do when you start listening to that
[1:51:05] it starts giving you that feeling of
[1:51:07] oh no
[1:51:09] oh no
[1:51:11] what are we going to do
[1:51:13] and then that turns into a little bit of
[1:51:15] fear has anybody ever been there
[1:51:18] and it turns into a little bit of fear
[1:51:20] and then you begin to think about it you
[1:51:21] begin to panic and i was driving down
[1:51:23] the road and i could just feel that
[1:51:24] nervous tension in my body and my back
[1:51:26] and i was just driving down the road and
[1:51:28] finally it just dawned on me and i just
[1:51:30] spoke out loud and i said
[1:51:32] devil let me tell you something i've
[1:51:36] listened to you oh i'm going to listen
[1:51:38] to you
[1:51:40] i spoke out loud to him because i'm not
[1:51:42] playing with him anymore
[1:51:44] i said i'll listen to you all i'm going
[1:51:46] to listen to you because the word says
[1:51:48] greater is he that is in me
[1:51:50] than he that is in the world and my god
[1:51:53] is a deliverer my god is a provider my
[1:51:56] god is a healer my god will give me this
[1:51:59] my god delivers when he says he will i
[1:52:01] don't care what you say devil you're a
[1:52:04] liar and go back to the pits of hell
[1:52:05] where you came from
[1:52:07] [Applause]
[1:52:10] i felt good i felt as good then as i do
[1:52:12] right now
[1:52:13] i'm about ready to jump off this stage
[1:52:15] right now because the presence of god is
[1:52:17] in this place with power and authority
[1:52:20] if you want it it's here for you
[1:52:36] tell him out loud
[1:52:38] you don't have to hide in the closet
[1:52:40] from me
[1:52:42] we don't hide from satan
[1:52:44] he's going to come after you let me tell
[1:52:46] you he's coming day after day after day
[1:52:48] i'm not hiding
[1:52:54] our pastor taught us wednesday night out
[1:52:57] of the book of revelations
[1:52:59] and i find it found it fitting that he
[1:53:01] would ask me to preach because this has
[1:53:03] been on my heart for some time
[1:53:05] and let me tell you how it works as god
[1:53:07] begins to show you things when you're
[1:53:09] when you're a preacher you begin to see
[1:53:10] things and you begin to have little
[1:53:12] thoughts and topics and you shot little
[1:53:14] notes down and brother bowler would
[1:53:15] preach something a couple weeks ago or
[1:53:17] so and i think man he's fixing to ask me
[1:53:19] i'm fixing to deliver
[1:53:22] nope
[1:53:24] the next preacher who preached somebody
[1:53:26] else would preach something i think it's
[1:53:27] got to come it's coming now it's got to
[1:53:29] be the next service
[1:53:30] nope
[1:53:34] lord i know you laying this on my heart
[1:53:36] for a reason
[1:53:41] he preaches out of revelations
[1:53:44] and i think
[1:53:45] oh boy
[1:53:46] when he opened up with revelations i
[1:53:48] thought
[1:53:50] maybe all those things you told me lord
[1:53:52] wasn't where i was supposed to be going
[1:53:53] because he asked me to preach and i knew
[1:53:55] which direction i was going
[1:53:57] but i hadn't finished all my thoughts
[1:53:58] yet
[1:54:00] let me back up god hadn't finished all
[1:54:02] my thoughts yet
[1:54:06] and he began to preach out of
[1:54:07] revelations and then as i looked at this
[1:54:09] and i thought about it
[1:54:11] and i thought the book of acts and the
[1:54:13] book of revelations and the book of mark
[1:54:16] 16 all of this dovetails for the
[1:54:18] believer
[1:54:19] and i knew it in my heart and i was
[1:54:20] trying to figure out how does this all
[1:54:22] dovetail into the believer but as we get
[1:54:25] ready to close let me read to you a
[1:54:27] portion of the church age book
[1:54:29] can you can you bear with me as we read
[1:54:31] some of the word
[1:54:33] the prophet says let me show you another
[1:54:35] reason why satan hates this book of
[1:54:37] revelation
[1:54:39] why he hates the book of revelations of
[1:54:41] jesus christ in the church
[1:54:43] because he knows that jesus christ
[1:54:46] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:54:50] and he changes not
[1:54:53] and he knows a whole lot more than do 90
[1:54:56] of theologians
[1:54:59] we're not dealing with a rookie
[1:55:05] he knows that since god is immutable in
[1:55:08] nature and he is just as immutable in
[1:55:11] his ways the brother sister that word
[1:55:13] immutable means he's not capable of
[1:55:15] change
[1:55:17] from the very beginning god has never
[1:55:19] changed
[1:55:22] you can bank on it he's never changed
[1:55:24] he said thus satan knows assuredly
[1:55:29] satan knows assuredly that the original
[1:55:32] church at pentecost with the power of
[1:55:34] god
[1:55:35] mark 16 in action
[1:55:38] he said is the true church
[1:55:42] listen now that jesus claims as his
[1:55:45] own
[1:55:48] you want to be god's own
[1:55:50] put mark 16 in action
[1:55:53] you want to be god's own put the book of
[1:55:55] acts chapter 2 chapter 3 in action
[1:55:58] he said now remember this christ in the
[1:56:01] true church is a continuation
[1:56:04] of the book of acts
[1:56:06] but the book of revelation shows how the
[1:56:09] antichrist spirit will come into the
[1:56:11] church
[1:56:13] who are we
[1:56:16] yeah he's coming for you
[1:56:19] don't be surprised
[1:56:21] he's coming for you the antichrist
[1:56:23] spirit would come into the church and
[1:56:25] defile it
[1:56:27] and he's going to make it lukewarm
[1:56:30] and formal
[1:56:32] and
[1:56:33] powerless
[1:56:40] powerless the very thing that we're
[1:56:43] striving for
[1:56:46] power and authority in the name of jesus
[1:56:48] christ
[1:56:49] satan's there to try to pull it the rug
[1:56:52] right out from under your feet
[1:56:56] powerless
[1:56:58] he said because it exposes satan
[1:57:01] it's revealing his works attempted
[1:57:03] destruction of god's people and
[1:57:05] discrediting god's word right down to
[1:57:08] the time that he's
[1:57:11] yesterday okay right up until the time
[1:57:13] that you got saved
[1:57:15] no
[1:57:17] right up in the time until he is cast
[1:57:19] into the lake of fire he fights it
[1:57:22] because he cannot stand it
[1:57:28] that's exactly why he's a troublemaker
[1:57:30] that's exactly why he comes to torment
[1:57:32] you that's exactly why he causes you
[1:57:34] problems because you hold the power in
[1:57:37] your hand that will eventually cast him
[1:57:39] into the lake of fire
[1:57:46] he knows
[1:57:47] that if the people get the true
[1:57:49] revelation of the true church
[1:57:52] and what she is what she stands for and
[1:57:56] what she can do the greater word
[1:57:58] works
[1:58:00] she will be an invincible army
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:05] i'm talking this morning to a group of
[1:58:07] soldiers i'm talking this morning to a
[1:58:09] group of warriors that will go out and
[1:58:11] face satan head on and say because of
[1:58:14] who god is greater is he and you will go
[1:58:18] back to the lake of fire
[1:58:22] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:58:24] spirits within the framework of the
[1:58:26] christian church
[1:58:28] by
[1:58:29] god's spirit discern withstand the
[1:58:31] antichrist spirit
[1:58:33] you know what satan will be
[1:58:36] powerless
[1:58:38] satan will be powerless before her
[1:58:41] he said oh he will be as definitely
[1:58:44] forted today as christ or as when christ
[1:58:46] withstood his every effort to gain power
[1:58:49] over him in the desert yes satan hates
[1:58:52] revelation but we
[1:58:54] love it
[1:58:56] that's why we need messages like this we
[1:58:58] need this from time to time to give us
[1:59:00] the revelation of who we really are
[1:59:03] i love the word i love to get deep into
[1:59:05] the scriptures but sometimes i just need
[1:59:06] to know that god is on my side
[1:59:10] and i can't lose
[1:59:12] do you realize that you cannot lose
[1:59:19] he said yes satan hates revelation but
[1:59:21] we love it with true revelation our
[1:59:23] lives the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:59:26] against us
[1:59:28] we will prevail over
[1:59:30] them
[1:59:31] he said you recall i mentioned at the
[1:59:33] beginning of this message that the book
[1:59:35] we're studying is actually the
[1:59:36] revelation of jesus himself in the
[1:59:38] church and the work in the future
[1:59:42] ages
[1:59:45] he said then i mentioned you take that
[1:59:47] home with you and think on that one we
[1:59:49] don't have time
[1:59:52] he said then i mentioned that it takes
[1:59:54] the holy spirit to give us revelation or
[1:59:56] we will fail to get it he said bringing
[1:59:59] these two thoughts together you will see
[2:00:00] that it won't take just ordinary study
[2:00:05] you can read your bible all you want
[2:00:08] you can underline you can highlight you
[2:00:10] can circle you can put a star
[2:00:14] it won't take ordinary study
[2:00:17] he said no no no it it
[2:00:19] to bring thinking to make this book real
[2:00:21] he said it's going to take the operation
[2:00:23] of the holy ghost that's why when you
[2:00:26] sit down to read your bible you say god
[2:00:28] anoint me
[2:00:30] to be able to hear and see your word to
[2:00:33] pull out of the word what you would have
[2:00:35] for me
[2:00:37] that means that this book can't be
[2:00:39] revealed to anyone but a special class
[2:00:42] of people
[2:00:50] somebody's gonna run before we get out
[2:00:52] of
[2:00:52] here it'll take one with the prophetic
[2:00:56] insight
[2:00:59] it will require the ability to hear from
[2:01:01] god it will require supernatural
[2:01:04] instruction not just a student comparing
[2:01:06] verse to verse or though that's good he
[2:01:09] says but a mystery requires teaching of
[2:01:12] the spirit or it never becomes clear
[2:01:20] can the church world hear this kind of
[2:01:22] word
[2:01:24] and move the way we're moving
[2:01:26] can the presence of god be felt under
[2:01:29] this kind of preaching in that church
[2:01:32] um
[2:01:37] how we need to hear from god and lay
[2:01:39] ourselves open
[2:01:41] and become yielded to the spirit
[2:01:44] and to hear and know
[2:01:49] i told you one of my greatest
[2:01:50] experiences when i became laid down and
[2:01:53] yielded to the spirit
[2:01:57] the presence was unbelievable
[2:02:01] and it's it's a presence that i wish i
[2:02:03] could replicate every time but i have to
[2:02:05] be honest and say that it doesn't happen
[2:02:07] every time
[2:02:09] but oh when it does
[2:02:12] god sent us another church
[2:02:14] just before the end time
[2:02:17] that the power of the holy ghost can
[2:02:19] come into her
[2:02:22] her
[2:02:23] the bride the church the bride that the
[2:02:26] power of the holy ghost can come into
[2:02:27] her in the demonstration of the spirit
[2:02:30] and mark 16 can follow the church and
[2:02:33] acts 2 4 acts 2 38 all of it will be
[2:02:36] following right along with the church
[2:02:38] signs and wonders
[2:02:40] accompanying the apostles
[2:02:46] signs and wonders
[2:02:48] accompanying
[2:02:49] the apostles
[2:02:50] great signs of there's a resurrection
[2:02:52] accompanying them
[2:02:54] while we were in prison surely god is
[2:02:56] growing a crop up somewhere
[2:02:59] this morning
[2:03:01] he said and out there in the land
[2:03:04] out there in the land this is where this
[2:03:07] will go i will trust that this message
[2:03:09] will help bring back vitamins
[2:03:13] into your system that you will grow
[2:03:16] spiritual power back into your life
[2:03:20] when brother branham preached that let's
[2:03:22] stand to our feet musicians would come
[2:03:24] when brother branham preached that that
[2:03:26] right there that portion of scripture
[2:03:28] are quotes come out of the uh message
[2:03:29] called deceived church by the world
[2:03:32] and when he preached that he was talking
[2:03:34] about
[2:03:35] talking about samson and he was talking
[2:03:37] about samson uh
[2:03:40] and during that message he was giving a
[2:03:41] warning out to the people and he's
[2:03:43] telling him simpson the philistines are
[2:03:45] on thee
[2:03:47] and he says
[2:03:49] worldly ism is creeping in amongst you
[2:03:51] branham tabernacle the philistines are
[2:03:53] upon you
[2:03:55] pentecost the philistines are upon you
[2:03:58] and i want to say this morning even in
[2:03:59] light the philistines are upon you
[2:04:03] but greater is he
[2:04:11] i'm going to close with the quote i
[2:04:13] started with and you think about this as
[2:04:15] you go home
[2:04:16] our church ought to be walking the
[2:04:19] street
[2:04:20] healing the sick
[2:04:22] raising the dead casting out devils
[2:04:26] doing signs and wonders making the whole
[2:04:28] world realize that jesus christ
[2:04:31] lives
[2:04:34] that's what we ought to be doing
[2:04:37] let's bow our heads
[2:04:41] heavenly father we come before you lord
