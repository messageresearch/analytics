everyone out in the house of God on the Saturday afternoon and we were just driving down here today and just kind of reminiscing a little bit as we was driving on the good times and memories we've had down here and I was telling brother Thomas there in the back room the first time we came here was about 10 years ago this month and I told him I said man I wasn't married just just started out on the road preaching a little bit here we are 10 years later married and got a little baby boy Malachi and if you haven't seen him just hold on a few minutes you'll hear him because he he enjoys the house of God Amen but wish your sure honor to be back with you all tonight and I sure appreciate the assembly here and the community and what you're doing for the Lord and amen just just thankful to still be pressing on amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to just invite you in the scriptures to a few places tonight we want to look in the Book of John the 14th chapter The Book of John the 14th chapter and then also I want to look in the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter but we just have a few things here tonight upon our heart and we just pray that something can be said to bless you and to help you and to encourage you and we we sure sure want to say it's an honor and a privilege to be here tonight and we appreciate the confidence of your pastor brother Thomas our friend to come and to minister to you once again and I think the last time I was here was right after covet and I think you might even been home sick and a lot of folks out and uh so we we're sure thankful that Devil's past and we're here on the other side of it amen amen The Book of John the 14th chapter and the 12th verse and just before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together tonight amen and let's just speak to the author tonight Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this beautiful Saturday afternoon Lord I know to the world it's a day of relaxation it's a day of pleasure Lord It's a day of activities father Lord to some may have so misinterpreted your word that they've Lord made it the day of the Sabbath Lord the father as Believers here tonight we're not here to honor a Creed or to honor a Doctrine or to honor an idea but Lord to us it's another day to serve you it's another day to live for you and to come into your house and to come into your presence and Lord to lift up holy hands father hands that once held things that were Lord displeasing in your sight hands that went and and feet that took us places we should have never been Lord but father by your blood you've redeemed us out of every tongue and every nation or whatever Kindred oh God the Father you brought us under the umbrella of your word and Lord as we come here tonight we've come to do one thing and that is to lift up the name that is above every name that's not the name of a man but it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for Lord we know that if that name every knee has to Bow every tongue has to confess Lord every devil is defeated at the mentioning of the name of Jesus so Lord we're inviting you tonight may you may you come in this building may you take the preeminence Among Us Lord father may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit Lord may you bring an anointing father Lord may you bring an atmosphere into the building tonight Lord that hearts and lives could be changed oh God lord we know there's needs father but Lord we know the need meter you are the Waymaker so tonight Lord we surrender Our Lives into your hands come have your way Among Us Lord Reveal Your word to us and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it to do thy Wonderful Name the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says a man and amen The Book of John the 14th chapter and in the 12th verse Jesus you're speaking of the power of the Believers and he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now the prophet of God makes it very plain that you're not going to do greater in quality but you'll do greater in quantity so he said he stopped nature raised the day and healed the sick so you're not you're going to do something he didn't do but actually you're going to do more of it because now he is in you whatsoever ye shall see or else if you shall ask in my name he says that well I do that the father may be glorified in the son now watch this if ye shall ask anything in my name he says I will do it amen if you shall ask anything in my name amen I will do it now if we turn to the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter I know you're very familiar with this reading in Hebrews 11 but I think here is where we find uh the source of the power to ask those things in his name in Hebrews the 11th chapter we want to look in the very first verse Paul here writing he says now Faith is the substance of things hopeful it's the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report so for by faith the elders obtained a good report verse 3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing and to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon uh from those passages of scripture this afternoon I want you by the help of the Lord to speak to here for a few moments and if I entitle this and I I want to speak to you on the bride's uh Paradox the brides Paradox you know I I believe that we're living in a season amen of paradox don't you I believe we're leaving it living in a season amen where God is among the church and he's doing Mighty Miracles he's doing Mighty powerful wonderful uh things that Minds cannot even understand or comprehend and then because it's not a minute but it's the Lord himself doing it you know as you as your Believers you're well Tall you know that the prophet of God will actually preach about six times a sermon called Paradox and in 1963 he says now according to Webster a paradox is something that seems incredible but it's true so therefore Paradox he said would be the same as a miracle a paradox is when something that seems like it couldn't be he said the knowledge of the human mind is all together incredible amen but yet it's proven true now a miracle would be the same thing for a miracle cannot be explained so when you actually see the word paradox you can interchange that word with the word miracle because a paradox actually is a miracle amen and a miracle is a paradox he said now a miracle would be the same thing he said it's something that happens and you cannot explain it he said see that makes it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's the truth and our people today he said a lot of modernists believe that the days of Miracles are yes I don't even believe in such a thing as Miracle he said but yet I believe that the world is full of paradoxes I believe and then that the world is full of Miracles I believe amen that the Paradox is constantly so this is not something amen that's just happening once in a while it's not something just happening once a year or twice a year amen but a paradox the prophet of God said is something that has happened and constantly amen because it's a miracle and we know who is The Miracle Worker amen The Miracle Worker is the Holy Spirit The Miracle Worker amen is Christ now if you study Through the Bible you'll see that the Bible actually specifically uh Records about 45 Miracles amen of Christ beginning with him turning water into wine amen at the marriage when they ran out of wine now as I'll say this tonight maybe if I can just maybe make a declaration here amen I believe that we have seen Miracles how many would agree amen we've seen Miracles I believe amen that we are seeing Miracles I believe that right now amen we're seeing Miracles but I also believe amen that we shall see Miracles so payment we have seen Miracles we are seeing Miracles and we shall see Miracles amen because the god of Miracle has returned to the church in the form of the anointed word now the prophet of God makes it very plain he says anything amen that's out of the ordinary gets a miracle anything that is out of the ordinary that is a miracle so you say well amen I'm just an ordinary Christian well if you as an ordinary Christian amen you would be in church on a Saturday night because ordinary Christians and then they don't go to church on Saturday night if you was an ordinary Christian you wouldn't still be believing after everything you've been through amen if you was an ordinary Christian you still wouldn't have a love in your heart and a desire eight men to hear the things of God Amen but because you're a miracle amen you're not an ordinary Christian you are a miracle you are a paradox amen and after everything that you've been through amen you're still believing you're still confessing amen and you're still moving forward amen because you yourself are a paradox now when you start thinking about this Paradox the prophet says it very beautiful but I said world is full of paradox amen now do you realize out of all the planets tonight there's only one that's mentioned in the Bible there's Mars Neptune Jupiter there's all these planets but there's only one mission in the Bible amen and that is the earth that you're setting on Amen and the Bible says that we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God amen so that the things which are seen and they're not made of things which do appear now the prophets of this very Earth that we're sitting on is a paradox what is it amen it's the word of God made manifest amen he made it without anything to make it out of Amen the only thing he had was his word amen and his word is a creation in itself and then his word is a creation in itself he said then when it's once spoke the word it can never return to him until it's accomplished amen that which it is restore amen he said all his word cannot return amen until it is accomplished that which it's been spoken for amen God is waiting this afternoon Amen on a people that'll take a hold of that word amen and they will hold it until it's accomplished amen that which it is purposeful listen if God sends his word amen he does not send it by accident he does not send it by chance it is not send it by happenstance amen but if God sends his word he said he sent his word and he healed the people amen then his word is the Healer his word is to deliver his word is the Waymaker amen and if his word is in the church tonight amen that his word will not come into a meeting and return unto him void amen but if he sends his word to deliver somebody's going to get delivered and he sent his word to heal somebody's going to get healed if he sends his word to bring you an answer somebody's going to receive an answer listen we are not following the call of our image and he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and his word is never failed amen it will never fail amen because heaven Earth will pass away amen but my words shall never pass away because it's a word and it's a creative word and God is looking for somebody Amen to take a hold of that word oh man it cannot return void hey man it can cause it to authoritative amen creative word now amen do you realize what kind of words you're taking a hold of you're taking a hold of creative word then what that tells me brother Tom Thomas is we are under the power of a creative word now I tell you what a prophet said he said every man and woman in here has everlasting life by the creative word of God who's spoke things into existence and then then the god that is in your life is the card that is spoke the world into existence he's the god that hung the moon he placed the Stars he put the sun in its place come on church amen and that God Amen is in you tonight by the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen amen if the devil give you eternal life the devil can take it away amen but the devil didn't give it to you so the devil can't take it from you even because the same God Hallelujah the same God Amen that said let there be a son and let there be a moon it's the same God that spoke over your line and spoke into the depths of your soul and placed a seed of life in there listen friends amen I'm not talking about an imaginary God I'm talking about the God of John 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen see them the scope can word cannot be taken back for a mistake the spoken word cannot be taken back from a stake he said in the beginning was the word now the word of God written in the Bible is just to us Amen in every promise has the same power of creation behind it he said that's God's word did at the beginning he meant if we believe it to be the word of God he said it depends on where the seed Falls amen if it falls into a ground that can create that has a moisture and a nourishment around the promise of God it'll bring forth every promise that the Bible made he said in the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God Amen will bring it to pass if you'll just look at it and take care of the word amen because the infinite God spoke and it's his word then do you realize who you are amen you're not just church members amen but the Book of Luke says there were four types of ground amen and there were four seed different types of seed rather rather one seed fell into four different types of ground amen I'll get it straight in a minute four types of ground one seed amen and there was only one type of ground a man that brought forth a fruit amen because it was a good ground and the prophet identifies amen that a good ground is a creative ground then do you realize what you are tonight is you are a creative ground Amen to receive a creative word amen and there's a power behind that word there's an anointing behind that word there's a Deliverance behind that word there's a power behind that word listen listen friends it's your turn to speak amen it's your turn to believe amen it's your turn to be a miracle it's your turn to see the Red Sea open it's your turn to shout the Jericho walls down it's your turn ain't meant to believe God for the impossible amen it's your turn to step out amen and speak to the mountain and the mountain have to be amen and someday somehow maybe some way by the time we'll get good enough amen but let me give you a disclaimer amen if you memorize every word and every take there is you'll never be good enough without the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so God has provided a propitiation Amen to put a bride amen back on the speaking terms with God and she can stand before any obstacle she can stand before he mounted and she can declare greater is he that is in me and he that is in the enemy against me yes sir if he abide in me and my word in you then you ask what you will and it shall be given to you come on Church Moses stood there and said let there be frogs and the prophet of God say if the blood of a bull or a goat amen be used for a bleach which can only cover amen could put a man in position are you hearing me could put a man in position to speak the creative word and bring flies into existence amen then why would you stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ blood which could speak us coil into existence amen the same as he did a frog a bone church and then if somebody tonight somebody told me one time brother they said you know what amen if you're so big on this spoken word amen then where's your squirrels you know y'all forgive me okay hey but if you're going to ask me a dumb question you're going to get a dumb answer okay I'm not squirrel hunting I don't need squirrels tonight I'm not squirrel hunting amen well if you got that Turtle then why aren't you speaking the storms amen cause I'm not out in nature hunting tonight amen but I'm in the poop head and I'm preaching the word of God and I need an atmosphere amen I need a pool of feet amen I need an answer amen so I'm not going to speak for something that I don't have neither of Amen I'm going to speak for something I need and some of you all need your babies to be saved you need your Revival back you need your joy restored you need the peace of God Amen to come into your life and the only way it's going to happen is if the god of paradox ain't been coming to your soul and anoint your faith to believe amen it only takes one believer it only takes one believer amen see a paradox amen if God can just get one man that he can wrap his Spirit into him he said he'll tell the rest of it there will be an another Paradox until he can get someone that is completely surrendered he said that's the way God does his work is he uses paradoxes he's got to get someone who is completely surrendered now you all know we are either surrender to God or we're surrendered to Satan or were surrendered to Satan now the problem of God shows you that the maniac of gadera he said he was surrendered to the devil he said he was cutting himself he said that was the devil's power he said if you ever seen somebody with double their power it's a maniac they're completely annoying to a Satan are you hearing me they are completely Anointed with Satan he said but if satanic power amen gives them twice their strength he said if a person completely surrendered to the devil will give him twice his strength amen then what will a man who is completely surrender to God do Oh Glory if a man can so surrender to the devil that he can actually become completely anointed amen with a devil power and he can bind himself and break himself out of chain amen then what about the Bride of Jesus Christ he said it on me said it'll make you so weak he said maybe you're crippled and you can't stand up amen but if you'll surrender yourself to God and a new life and a new strength comes in you amen you a coach or walking away if the devil can put you down the street that I can get you up if the devil can put you on the bottom the strength of God can lift you to the top and we forgot who we're serving we're not sir Buddha we're not serving Muhammad amen we're serving Jehovah amen and I believe there's some Believers in here tonight that need to reach above your problems you need to reach above your situations you need to reach above your hurts and get a hold of Jehovah amen and pull the streets of Jehovah into your life amen he'll raise you up out of that condition and you'll walk again you'll believe again you'll worship again no praise again you'll see God again you'll enjoy the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost when new life comes in you I love what my Bible says Isaiah said it like this he said the Lord Jehovah is my strength my strengths ain't the Republicans and it sure ain't for Democrats my strength is not be independent and it sure ain't the Liberals my strength is Jehovah can I tell you like this and Isaiah goes on to say trust in Jehovah for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength that's why you're still here tonight is because in you it's not just the strength of your human ability amen but the strength that's in you is the strength of Jehovah now sometimes I just gotta preach a little bit amen cause I get to thinking amen if we really realized how strong we were hey it'd probably have to sit us down during service amen they'd probably they'd probably think we're a little too loud Brother Brad and then because when it really Dawns on you amen that the strength that's in you it's not the strength from your honestly mother it's not the strength from the earth say father Amen to Sister Nancy the shrinks that's on the inside of you has come from The Experience on the back side of the desert when you met God for yourself and there was a quickening power amen that dropped in your soul alone Church you know what I think we ought to do we ought to tell that devil I'm stronger today than I was yesterday I'm stronger tonight than I was this morning amen and if I'm here tomorrow I'll be stronger tomorrow and if I'm here next week I'll be stronger next week amen because my street amen is not coming from a temporary scores amen not streaks it's coming for Jehovah and he's the Eternal Everlasting infinite God and His shrinks is Everlasting oh my what are you saying I'm saying Jehovah then is the god of paradox and then because sometimes to see a paradox you've got to believe for a long time sometimes to see a paradox you better believe when every physical evidence is giving you reason not to believe amen but something on the inside of you takes a hold of God's word amen and you know what you confess you confess God's word is the truth God's word is the truth now Amen brother when I set you like this probably God tells us that truth is more Stranger Than Fiction do you realize people actually amen believe fiction before they believe and then you all know they tell the story it meant that William Tell put an apple upon this boy's head and he shot the app off of his son's head but you realize that didn't even happen amen but it's fiction and it's so great the minds of people that generation after generation after generation amen fiction has been passed down because it's more it's more amusing maybe than really truth is do you realize the prophet said he was over in France one time he said and then we went up on a hill and he said while I was up there I began to say something and they looked at me and said shh you're not allowed to talk up here he said well why am I not allowed to talk they said because years ago there was a man down in the city who got in a fight and he got killed but he didn't want to die there got his head cut off but he didn't want to die there so the man with his head cut off reaches over picks his head up carries it up the mountain lays it down and dies there and he said now this is a sacred spot come to God said my faith amen is too weak to believe that I had to get on the same page with brother Branham amen my faith is too weak now come on Church there's people that will believe that amen but they will not believe that a cancer can disappear in the body there are people that will believe that but they cannot believe that an alcohol demon can be destroyed in the life of a man and make him a real man they'll believe that but they won't be that God Amen can take a young person addicted to the perversion of the world and set him free and fill them with the Holy Ghost amen I tell you what I don't believe that picture but I believe the truth and the truth is amen who the son is made free is free indeed and there ain't no devil can stop it because it's not coming from a source of fiction it's coming from truth [Applause] are you hearing me amen I'm not preaching fiction I'm preaching truth you know what kind of truth I'm preaching Vindicated truth foreign I'm not preaching any kind of truth I'm preaching Vindicated truth then the world will accept fiction but they will reject Vindicated truth let me set you like this you all agree with me we're living in Italy we're living in an evil world we're living in an evil world where the world is full of fiction now let me set you like this but we are Sanctified by the god of righteousness so we're in this evil world but we're actually Sanctified by the god of righteousness see now I'll tell you what that is that's a paradox are you hearing me that's like being in the fire and coming out and not even smelling like smoke are you with me that's like going into a into a into a a a a a a smoke infested building and coming out and you smell like you just walked out of the mall or something you know what I'm saying you're in it but there's actually something keeping you from what's around you are you hearing me y'all know what I'm you you deer hunters know what I'm talking about and then you don't walk in the mall before you go to the tree stand hey because you walk in there and there's stuff in that atmosphere that will attach itself to you there'll be smells get on you are you hearing me amen so you gotta you gotta be preserved oh Church of the Living God Amen you are walking through the most deceptive most fictional most evil age it's ever been but here you are tonight in the house of God they've been believing in the power of the Holy Ghost what is that amen it's the prayer of Jesus over your life you know what Jesus said he said I pray father that thou shouldest take them out of world Amen but thou says keep them from the evil amen so they're going to be in the world but they're going to be kept from the evil that's in the world they are not of the world as I am not of the world he said so sanctify them through thy truth and thy word is the truth in your sanctifying power your cleansing power is the word now I just want to read this to you from the church age book remember I said here is most heavily set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in the sun was by the indwelled manifesting in word and work somebody say word worked word worked now I've been on the field long enough to meet people and brother Thomas y'all tell me we're on Word Church we're a word church and they actually Pride themselves in being a word church hey we ain't got none of them worked we ain't got none of that emotion of that shouting we're just a word church and then I've met other churches and they ain't in a word they're just works you know everything's works but here's the beautiful thing about it there is no such a thing there is no such a thing as a word church and then a Works Church well let's go be a word church amen the prophet of God said amen that the word and the words work together he said when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very Works amen that Jesus produced the word is God the spirit is God they are all one so one cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God that is how it was with the prophets because they have the indwelling spirit of God God and the word came to them so the word comes to the spirit he said see in Jesus in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him he said now remember John the Baptist was both prophet and messenger of his name he was filled with the holy ghost from this mother's womb when he was baptized in the Jordan the word of God Jesus came to him because the word always comes to the truly Spirit field then you cannot be a word church and not have the spirit and you cannot be a spirit church and not have the word amen because the word comes to the spirit and the spirit comes to the word amen because they are the self same person I say oh thank you Lord we're not about your formals and one and a bunch of Fanatics in the other amen but God who is rich in Mercy has sent an adoption message to bring us out of the confusion of armenianism and the confusion of Calvinism and to places in the middle of the road in the book of Ephesians amen positionally placed amen we're not here trying to make something happen we're not here trying to work something up amen the word and accompanies the works and the spirit comes to the word now y'all know I'm telling you the truth amen the word and the spirit are the same he said that's what Jesus said would be the evidence the Holy Ghost which you would be in the word of your age right now did you notice that Jesus said oh watch this the world cannot receive the Holy Ghost you're in that world you are in the world that cannot receive the Holy Ghost but yet Mr Hannah you got the Holy Ghost amen amen you got the Holy Ghost young people amen but you're in a world that cannot receive it do you know why you got it because Jesus prayed for you and he prayed that the father amen would sanctify you by the word and in you as a creative ground that when the people you grew up with and the people who you go to school with amen were born to reject it there was a creative crown on the inside of your soul that was ordered to receive it listen if you got the Holy Ghost you'll ought to be the most happiest person in this building tonight that you're in a world that cannot receive it amen by the grace of God has predestinated your womb to receive the Holy Ghost and because they can't receive the Holy Ghost they cannot receive the word but watch this amen here again we find the word coming because of the spirit of God now amen I like to I like to study the prophet of God and in John 16 13 he gives you some beautiful commentary on the on one verse he says now how be it with he the spirit of truth I'm going to stop she says the word is come he will guide you into all true he stops again and since Thy word is truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear he stops again and says word of God that shall he speak and he stops and says word and he will show you the things that he is to come now watch this he said see the spirit bringing the word of Prophecy amen now come on Church you're in a world that cannot receive the Holy Ghost you're in a world that cannot receive the word but here you are tonight and you're receiving what the world you're living in cannot receive why it is it because the prophet said you are a prophetic class of people so the spirit bringing the word it was not a dead letter amen it was not an intellectual letter it was a prophetic word that would fall into your soul and here would be the evidence that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age he would be in the word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving the word here it is the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth which is the word amen but to receive the truth the word and to believe it and to obey it the evidence of a Believer is not to work something up now Amy can I just take a little liberty here amen I believe if you preach the message the church will shout somebody said what side are you on I said what do you mean they said are you on emotional versus are you on emotional versus intellectual or intellectual versus emotional I said well brother you got the wrong guy here he said what do you mean I said but I've never taught that he only taught two verses Christianity versus idolatry and wisdom birth Liberty and preach whoever made it a fight over shouted in the house of God didn't get it from brother Brandon now you all telling the church amen we live in a day and time amen where guys will spend hours trying to find quotes to justify shouting and other guys will spend hours find the quotes Amen to justify while we shouldn't be shouting and you can find quotes on both sides but can I just ask you this whatever happened to just preaching the message I mean whatever happened to just tell him what a prophet said and just preaching it well we got to get them worked up well if you work them up somebody else will work him down amen but if you'll preach the message and let an atmosphere come in the building and the believer will recognize her position in an evil age that they're Sanctified by the god of Truth Listen that'll make me want to shout more than a hot guitar it'll make me want to shout more than a set of drums is to know I'm living in a world that is rejected truth but God who is rich in Mercy has allowed me to receive amen the evidence of his word and the age I'm living I said and when you receive that you'll outrun the horses of Elijah when you receive that you'll get your hearts off the willow trees to know that you have been the elected chosen Lady of almighty God brother and I guess I think we got that day without a building preach the message now you say Belinda you're getting sorry out there am I really were in a battle and it's a battle for truth probably God said in the my sins has it been lost but God said they would be restored again in the last day now watch this we're looking for that property of Malachi Thor but we're not looking tonight we've seen him he said now we're looking for his manifestation and we'll see the Vindicated word of God now listen this there will be just a few understand it there will be just a few understand it as it was in the days of MOA so will it be in the coming of the son of man in the days of locks three were saved amen so shall it be in the Communists and a man there will be very few saved amen translated in that time because one of the Mysteries of the church being taken up amen so in this age brother Joe there's only going to be a few that's going to be able to receive amen the understanding of the word of God now listen friends somebody asked me one time they said why do y'all preach at Malachi 4 why do you all preach at that word has got to be restored Joel too amen because the bride will take the Rapture by the word she does not take the Rapture by feelings she does not take the Rapture by emotions come on church she does not take to Rapture by the way she feels she takes the raps sure by the word that's why the prophet of God said you're a word bride in a word age under a word anointing because the only thing that can Rapture the bride is the word oh my I feel like preaching on that point for a second you all realize on the morning of the Rapture you may wake up and feel lower than a snake's belly you may wake up feel like everybody hates you nobody loves you amen you're the most unworthy person amen if anybody should be lost it ought to be you you're the chief of Sinners you're the lowest thing that God ever made and then why you're standing in the mirror they've been combing your hair you'll see your loved one appear behind you do you realize they did not appear because of how you felt they did not appear because of how good you thought you were they appeared because God sent a prophet to restore the word of translation to the Church of the Living God and to put her in positions for Rapture listen friends we're going home we're not going to stay here we're going home one of these mornings our bodies are going to be changed and they're not going to be changed by the way we feel they're not going to be changed by how high or how low we are they're going to be changed because the word has put them under obligation to be changed oh man somebody shot a change see it's coming from the that's why you're a paradox you're in an age an intellectual age but you still believe that God keeps his word in this intellectual age you still believe this the same yesterday today and forever you still believe me can discern the thoughts of the human heart you still believe he can change a man you still believe he can keep every word that he promised in this day I'm on church and you still believe that the same angel of God the same angel of God that was here is doing the very same thing it did when he was here on Earth Amen manifested in human flesh oh my y'all see this picture here some people get tore up about that picture and the problem is all they see is a man but I see God now y'all forgive me I actually see God I see a prophet but I see God I see the logos I see the creator of the heavens and the earth I see God above his head and what is in that Pillar of Fire was what got into Moses is what God in Nepal I'm old church that's the same thing that got into Jesus are you hearing me that's the same anointing that's the same Angel amen that choker the same angel that met Moses and brought the children of Israel the law it's the same angel that met Paul and brought him from the dispensation of law into Grace is the same angel that met a man named William Branham on the Ohio River and commissioned him to preach a message that would put the bride in a Rapture in order do you know what God is wanting he's wanting somebody to believe that's him he's wanting somebody to believe it's not just a man it's not just a Kentuckian it's not just a preacher that's the logos of God he's looking for somebody he meant to believe that's the Creator he's looking for somebody to believe that hello him he's looking for somebody to believe that's Jehovah-jireh he's looking for somebody to believe that he is yeah and he's still with his church tonight yes sir he said I believe God is one of the people Amen to believe in Paradox amen I believe it should be a paradox right here I believe that God is willing to take and he's wanting to take his people and show himself if he can only get a man or woman boy or girl to lay down their own talks you got to lay down your own thoughts and you got to become a prisoner to him and believe him listen if you're going to see a paradox you've got to become a prisoner to the god that performs Paradox he is his word can I say it to you like this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made freshly wealth Among Us can I go ahead and bring it on home brother Thomas and the prophet said and now he is in you [Applause] brother well Glory now he is in you he just brought him from the creation to the age you're living in and said he's in you the hope of glory and he's the same yesterday today and forever and he automatically connects his presence and you to John the 14th chapter and says he that believeth on me amen The Works that I do shall he do also are you hearing me see now watch this he's a preacher that's beautiful but that's in the future I say that's now brother I say now he is in you well someday brother we'll get over in the Millennium and he'll get in us no what about right now you say preacher you ain't got no scripture for that oh but I do it's First John 3 beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when heat shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is don't you see who you are you are the mighty goat you are the Bride of Jesus Christ The Mighty God has been unveiled on the inside of you and now all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he is poured into the church listen trans I say that's now amen don't you let some Catholicism death or come in the ranks of this message and put this in the future it's right now and don't you let some Church of Christ therefore come in this message and put in the past it's right now right now we are redeemed oh God hallelujah right now we are healed right now we are saved right now we are the certain Daughters of God listen I know the devil's put this off in the future and the church is sitting there twidding their thumbs and talking about a day going by and looking for a day to come but why don't you tonight in the name of the Lord rise up and realize this is your hour this is your message this is your anointing this is your age this is your season this is your time this is your Paradox this is your hour to believe God and she surround across the Red Sea this is your hour he meant to see the Miracles this is your hour to see the power of God calling the church again it's not in the future it's right here now it's not in the future it's right here now now we are the sons of God oh now this very hour right now not we will be this very hour brother what are you saying preacher I'm saying we are in the god of paradox we are in the god of paradox but the god of paradox is in US [Applause] we are in him but he is in US can I prove it to you about the Bible is it any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new can I prove it to you to whom God would make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory so if if you are in him you're a new creature and if he is in you you're on your way to Glory brother let me have a little dancing room right there if he is in you then all things are passed away old habits are gone but setting sins are defeated and he has made you a new creature in Christ Jesus and in fact God is in you and he has transformed you ever born again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themself he said I believe each one of you Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran that never had the experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine New Birth and has now received the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone can look it's you and know what a paradox is a miracle some of y'all got ready tonight and you said Lord I want to see a miracle and he was looking at one in the mirror by the Thomas they want to see a miracle and they they feel the Lick in the mirror they are a miracle y'all know I'm telling the truth amen everything the devil tried it didn't work because you're still here [Music] but you're still here and you're still believing and you're still preaching that man it must be amen it's not the strength of the Ballers it's not the strength of your father it's the streets of Jehovah that got on the inside of you that has claimed you well devil get out of here there is a paradox in the building tonight because you were born again and when you're born again you believe in miracles because you're a part of God see what is it it's Jesus on the inside and he's working on the outside oh what a change in my life see what's happening is is God is interpreting his own word in your life through your flesh I can read it to you the father God said he is the word with his true interpretation now you say oh leave me the Bible sir we believe the Bible but now if you believe the Bible Jesus said in the Bible Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also that's the true interpretation of the Bible for God himself is in you speaking back his own interpretation Glory he said God in you interpreting his own word didn't Jesus say these signs shall follow them that believe it's God in you giving his own interpretation you don't have to look to somebody else all you got to say Amen is believe it and it will interpret itself because it's God using you to interpret his own word are you ready for this Christ is the living interpretation of his own word that I can stand before you tonight and declare without hesitate nation that we are not following cunningly devastables amen which we made known unto you amen the power and coming of our Lord Jesus but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty come on Church we're not just on Lookers we're eyewitnesses of the Majesty of the only true and living God are you hearing me are you hearing me now you know what the Bible says at the memo okay on time the Bible says that we've not followed kindly devised fables do you know what that word kindly means it means to play the part of a sophist it means to play the part of a sofas so actually when you look at pay the sofas you know what that is related to that is related to skepticism so we're not following amen skeptic fables we're not we're not Skeptics here tonight listen to a prophet can I can I preach to you he said may we see tonight the living Christ who is not dead raised again for our justification now live among us in the person of the Holy Ghost may he come tonight and speak to every heart visible and invisible audience and may he perform in their hearts that work of the new birth and bring them to the Redemption power of his resurrection and take away all Shadows of doubt and unbelief and destroy all skepticism come on church that's what his presence is here to do his presence is here to destroy boy I'll skepticism that the church might move on in perfect harmony with the will of God as presented by the Bible and the Holy Spirit Well I might as well preach I'm here don't you think it's time to grow up and quit being babies don't you think it's time to quit fussing him fighting like a bunch of babies on the playground amen that's the devil of skepticism and you want to see Miracles amen I pray to God you'll see one tonight I pray the same Holy Fire that fell on the altar or tall in your heart and Destroy everyone else's skepticism I know where I'm standing amen some of y'all ain't skeptical this message you're not skeptical of the Prophet you're skeptical of your own self amen well I've done this and I've done that and I can't do this but I'm gonna tell you what the prophet said he said my Ministry is different from the pastor my Ministry is different from the Evangelist he said my Ministry is to declare him he is here my Ministry is to declare him he is here now can I can I read it to you he said now I know this sounds rational but if you'll just bear with me I believe that I by God's help with his word and according to his word I can bring him right here before you brother I believe that God's help of his word and according to his word I can bring God right here before you you say Petro I want you back off of that message because that's the only Avenue being the god of Eternity into this building is by his word according to his word and by the help of his Spirit listen friends when you realize it's not a man just preaching sermons you'll quit getting all bowed up and pulled well we might as well preach amen I know what I'm talking about amen it used to be people come to church heard a sermon got corrected and repented and made the thing right and went on to serve God but we don't do that no more amen we blow up like a bunch of bullfrogs eating Buckshot we stay home we don't service we don't Fellowship we don't get together we're trying to prove a point they said all you're proven is you're an immature baby and you don't know how to take correction oh yeah well you know I'm a preacher not a politician are you hearing me all you're proven is the preacher stepped on your toes and you got your little feelings hurt but you know what y'all do y'all grow up foreign but I'm here when you realize that it's not a preacher here if he's preaching this message it's not a man just filling a poop head rehearsing to you some scriptures and some quotes and he's labored over it's a servant of God who's underneath the same Pillar of Fire and by God's help and his word he's bringing the church into the church oh God that's why brother Thomas said when you come to the house of God Amen is to change your life listen we're not here to play flitz under the table we're not here to just play around at Social time amen this is the house of God I'm just going to preach if that's okay and have we forgotten that the house of God is a House of Prayer it's a house of worship it's a house of Faith but don't you ever forget it's also a house of correction [Applause] glory to God y'all know I'm telling the truth amen you got your feelings hurt I know pushed them all the time their feelings are hurt I was in the barbershop for the day brother Thomas ice in the barbershop and there was a girl and her mama come in there and had a little boy and brother Brad that boy he didn't tell he ran the house you know run all over the place screaming jumping all over things hollering throwing stuff and his mom you know she just sitting there watching him like his normal you know his grandmother you tell she comes from the old school you know she got about two or three minutes that she got up over here got to hold that boy jerked him out by his arm laid into the backside of him sitting down the chair and said sit down behave yourself and act like you got some sense I said praise God there's still a few left in the world still a few left well Barbara was cutting my hair and you know what he said he said man I love Grandma I was like a few minutes later that boy he is sitting over and here's what he's doing he's going [Music] grandma got up she went over there she stood over him she said you drive that up before I give you something to cry about [Applause] he just kept on sitting there sniffling brother and carrying on and I love what she said she said draw all that nonsense up said you ain't hurt your feelings are oh he wasn't hurt his feelings work and y'all know that's what happens a lot of times is you think the preacher hurts you he didn't hurt you he hurt your feelings but I got a quote for that the prophet of God said it's time to separate your feelings from your faith and if you're a real believer you will not let your feelings amen stop you from getting a blessing from God if the preacher steps all over your toes you'll come back on the morning service and say preacher step on him again because I want to be a paradox bypass the Judgment I want to be a miracle it's a it's a Ministry of God bringing the presence of God in the building to show you who your maid is now what he's doing is he's keeping you in line are you with me he's keeping you alive because the prophet said he said the dove is always loyal to his mate whoa he said it may I stop here just a moment and say the true Bride is a female dove she is loyal to her man it won't inject it at all my any nominational doctrines anything in the world it'll stay loyal to its make to work it's amazing the meat the word your mate is the word that's what you must stay loyal to now you don't know that the Bible is the word right and if we took time we could show you that the Bible from Genesis to Revelation is full of paradoxes right full of paradoxes we could show you what the prophet God said about Noah he said no about faith said there would be rain and God said there would be rain God said so the saith the Lord he said is what Noah moved upon he said instead the order God said so amen it never meets the scientific approval of the day another place okay so when that time comes the word to be fulfilled it Reigns just the same now watch this we can speak of the three Hebrew children can have a few more minutes is that okay we can speak of the three Hebrew children who was a paradox of the keeping power of God we could speak of Daniel who was a paradox they went in a den full of hungry lines and how that could could be that man on a group of hungry lines stay there in the cave all night without any harm we could speak of Samson who is just an ordinary man young boy curly headed shrimp boy they've been part of God said he walked up there one day picked up a Jawbone that was dry I saw a thousand for listings right we could speak of we could speak of Joshua stop in the sand now probably God said he stopped the son not the Earth remember he said now watch he said the Bible teacher said no it was the earth he said no it was the son he said what did he do he stopped the sign he defied nature when he stopped the sun are you with me I'm turning the corner now he defied nature now the prophet of God said that is today the same God if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said that's defy nature but you have to have a motive and objective to that that's connected with it see find out in the word of God if it's supposed to be done and then if God is calling you to do it it'll do it and you know that it's spoken in the word to do it then God has called you to do it then it'll happen if your motive and your objective is right he said now watch that's why the Visions take place so can I set you like this Jesus when he was on Earth he was a paradox can I read this to you remember Jesus when he was on Earth he walked on the water now explain that to me scientifically tell me how a man can walk on water it was a paradox are you ready for this one one day he took five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand now I know we say five thousand but if it's okay let's make it a little bit bigger Bible says he fed five thousand men and their wives so if they had wives That's ten thousand and then we'll say they had kids and they had five apiece now we've gone from five thousand to fifty thousand uh y'all know I'm just just showing you how big our God is amen amen let's make it as big as we can to show you who he is now watch this now brother remember said when he said those he said what kind of Adam did he turn loose what kind of Adam did he turn loose he said now that wasn't now that fish wasn't even alive now listen church when he broke that bread he broke it off a piece of a biscuit and when he handed it out and he got his hand back there was another biscuit there I already raised the wheat in the field already cooked all the great Senate see seasoned here was a piece of fish he he broke it off and another piece of cut fish Hallelujah are you ready for this this is where I want to close he said that element is given to us [Applause] that element amen if you can give me a bit more in this year I'm gonna try to appreciate it that element is given to us it will just abide in the word if we can just abide in the word think about it if we can just abide in the word and stay there he said I believe we're on the verge of sin that happened in his hand he lived true to the word there you are he had cooked fish and there was a paradox amen can I set you back this tonight Church whatever element was in his hand is promised to be in his church come on now are you hearing they lined up and Jesus took that hand and he handed out a piece of fish and bread and by the time he got his hand back there was already another fish there was already another piece of bread and he handed that now you all know I'm telling the truth amen somebody was the first in line and somebody was the last in line but can I tell you the beautiful thing about it is the person last in line got the same thing yeah the person lasting line got the same thing the person first did on God because what happened the human element went out he said what was it it was deity being revealed in human beings listen friends amen if you lay aside the human element you lay aside the human mind get all the human elements out you will see the supernatural element come in the church and the prophets that human element goes out Supernatural element comes in can I say this to you and miracles only happen by the super sign and by The Sixth Sense which is the super sense can I have a few more minutes he said therefore the Lord himself shall give you what a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and Mark 11 22 Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God the blood membership is very beautiful he says we are grateful to God that we have the five senses but by no means were those five sixes given to you to guide you they were given to you for your Earthly contact he said about the Sixth Sense belongs only to the Christian how many Christians do we have here tonight amen then the Sixth Sense belongs to you and you cannot have the Sixth Sense until you become a Christian he said the Sixth Sense is better known to the Christian as Faith are you ready for this it's the one that governs and guides you and it's Superior to all other senses well glory to God anyhow amen The Sixth Sense which is the super sense is the sense that God sent to guide you and to govern you and that sense is superior to all other senses I'm laying some word in here now super sense he is the holy spirit he said it's the faith of God that dwells in you and if you're left of five senses be yielded to the sixth sense it will guide you and will bring all the other five senses under the control of that super sense are you ready for this that Sixth Sense will make you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about well glory to God Amen I'm gonna bring this home and this is the one the devil hates and the devil can get into these five senses and he can lie to you but he cannot the devil can get in your eyes and he can lie to you he can get in your hearing he can get in your Smail he can get in your taste come on church he can get in your field he can get in your memory your reason your affection your conscience your magic he can get in all those and lie to you but he cannot touch the super sense that's far beyond his reach because that comes from God it's called faith and the six it come for this reason only that was to make five stitches in you did not anything that's contrary to the word of God what are you saying preacher I'm saying how many wants to see a miracle can I ask you this how many needs a miracle can I tell you this to see a miracle you got to cast down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ what is the super sign brother amen he says the super sign is God in man ifesting his written word now what are you saying preacher I'm saying God has been above us God has been with us now he's got in US and Greater Works than this shall he do because I go to my father how many knows this quote Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts are you ready for this I'm going to skip to the bottom of that quote he says and he knows that if the people if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is not what she will be and not what she was but what she is and what she stands for and she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if she can get the Revelation she will be an invincible Army who is that she that she is the bride that she is the bride are you she [Applause] brother Richmond are you she are you she come on church are you she well then if you're she and I tell you what a prophet done a prophet referred to the Bride As She you know what he referred to her as as little bride I'm going somewhere he'd referred to her and say LeBron he said now don't you worry you little bride another place in the midst of Darkness who is going to bring the little bride out in another place he is pulling his little brown out in the Masterpiece he is going to bring this little brother smitten right back to the original side of the original word another place thank God the little bride has made herself ready recognizing your day 64 but when that little Bride come into you it was different she was the Alpha and the Omega oh God help me Lord can I give you another one lots of bridegroom taking the bride to her surprise how the little bride stands and all as she looks at her future home are you ready for this one now the humble little bride of Christ just simply believes the word whoever she is it's individuals I know what you're asking right now you're saying preacher why did you take time to emphasize on this bride being little bride because my Bible says that Proverbs 15 16 that batter is little with the fear of the Lord than break treasure and trouble therewith you know that word littleness means it means fewness you know what Jesus said he said fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom what are you getting that preacher I close with this little is much yeah I'm guessing it's still working littlest much little as much God is in it he's been above us he's been with us but little Brian he is now in US and literally as much if God is in it Tom but he's saying preacher I'm saying she nears that headstone you know what she's going to be she's going to be fewer in number but she's going to be greater in power [Applause] look at that pyramid starts out real wide at the bottom what's the closer you get to that Capstone the fewer it gets the more narrow it gets you know why because it was it was more at the bottom but there was less power come on Church there was more at the bottom but there was less power but when she nears The Headstone the prophet of God said the true bride Christ seed she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him what are you saying I'm seeing God God into two fish and Five Loaves and fed 50 000. God got in water and turned it into wine if God can get in that he can get in one believer and perform a paradox he said what was it it was a living God and a man that could lay itself out for God according to the word of God and the word of God will be made manifest to him what are you getting that preacher I'm saying it's ride time it's seed time it's harvest time I know I've gone a little bit long but give me just a grease right here he says I believe that Jesus Christ reincarnated in flesh in the human church here on Earth doing signs and wonders can I give you one more the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in his church in this last day what is it it's bride time it's adoption time it's the time the Satan has challenged Satan is challenged but the prophet is challenged and I love to say these words to him stupid devil stupid devil you know the challenge he's made is if God is in your midst where's all the Miracles God's in your midst and where's all the Miracles God's in you if God's in this message then where's all the Miracles you know what I say look no further stupid devil [Applause] this is the bride's paradox are you hearing me it's an age when God has come on the scene I don't mind this I hope you don't mind a few testimony I believe God's in the midst of the church I believe if you'll preach this message the god of paradox will come in the building and he will perform by the promise of his word I was out at the other day at Pennsylvania brother Jim Shu makes preaching while I was preaching I just stand there reading some discernments and my mom was reading to him but Thomas you know how it is you're preaching through something real quick and he's trying to get to a point and I just I just hit my iPad and skipped over a quote and spirit Lord just struck me said go back read it I said yes Lord so I said y'all forgive me I gotta find this I I scroll through found it and it was a discernment the prophet God said you you've got sinus trouble he said Do you believe Jesus Christ is the high priest Can Be Touched by the feeling of your infirmities he said now if you believe that he said now who you're touching he said he said you're you're 30 feet from me he said you're touching the high priest and when I read that I said praise God he's right here in this building tonight and brother brother I just went on preaching my message brother John is where I don't put you know and I got over to brother Jim's house and his son Jimmy was sitting there and we're sitting around the table eating and all of a sudden Jimmy goes just like that those kind of sniffs a little bit he goes and he goes oh my Lord dad he said I can't believe it he said for years I think he maybe said 15 or 20 years he said the side of my sinuses has been stopped up he said but Andrew I haven't been able to breathe out of this he said but I just remembered something it's about two hours later he said when you read that quote he said he said I believe that and said yes Lord I believe it and he said nothing changed he said but I said I believe it anyhow and two hours later a miracle was perfect [Applause] miracle was performed in that man's body who'd done it I didn't the word did it what are you saying preacher I'm seeing God is in the midst of his church it was out the other day I'm just going to share a few and I'm done it was after the day at brother biscals I was preaching there in a in a camp last year I was there preaching some of y'all hear probably know brother brother Murphy Wong he's a precious brother from China gotta hold this message and burn the world up with it now she's out there preaching and I didn't know his family but his daughter Grace and her husband brother Luis I believe is his name was sitting over in the meeting and while I was preaching I stopped math for third pool and I said now listen I said if a prophet spoke squirrels into existence I said and I stopped and I said like this I said God didn't come down and he didn't go down there and find some squirrel gut squirrel blood squirrel bones and say abracadabra abracadoo I make a squirrel out of you I said he didn't do that there was nothing there to make a scroll out of but he spoke to a prophet and a squirrel come into existence I said I believe the same God that could create something out of nothing can do the same thing for you I didn't know what our sister was going through her and her husband had been married for several years and they was just hiring a child that next year I go back for that camp and here comes brother Murphy if you know brother Murphy he's just about to that but now he's all happy you know he comes up and he says I must ask you I want to tell you or something you know brother Murphy talks he said I want you and he starts telling me and he said you remember last year when you was here and his daughter walked over there she said Let Me Tell It Hat she said while you were preaching she said I've been to the doctor and the doctor told me I could not have a child without a surgery amen because there was something missing in my body to conceive a child she said with Andrew I went through a prayer line two years before she said and brother Ron had a vision brother vision and said she'll have a baby she said I believe that my brother Ron's vision from God and the surgery of the doctor I would have that child she said but last year on that Wednesday night while you were preaching she said something struck my heart that if he could create a squirrel then he could do something to my body she said I went home the next day I got up to go to Camp the next morning she said I took a pregnancy test she said hardly nobody knew it but I come to Camp last year carrying a positive pregnancy test and she said here's the baby tonight [Applause] come on church that's not a preacher it's the god of paradoxes on the scene now I know I've gone over and you forgive me but I got to say this God has done something for every single one of you sitting here tonight done something for every single one of you sitting here your families your lives your marriages I come on Church y'all know I'm telling you the truth but it hadn't been without opposition but you know what I I come to if I didn't come to Elkton tonight to do anything else I'm gonna do it right now Satan is a defeated being and he knows it [Applause] [Music] Satan you are defeated in the name of Jesus Christ you have no Authority you have no power you say how can you say that I'm can I can I just share this with you this last few weeks ago I was over in North Carolina brother Joe Green's meeting there this missionary meeting I'd preached the first night but the wrong was coming he was preaching the rest of the meeting but on Wednesday morning there was a brother from South Africa his name was brother Nicholas arnick he's a missionary his dad's brother George Sonic and brother Nikki come out and he's a real fiery guy right but he come out to preach that morning man it was something I never seen before brother John he was just bouncing around and praise God I got to testify so to make a long story short the year before brother Nikki had been to the Amazon on a missionary trip when he got there he'd come back to the States He preached he went home to South Africa next day he gets home he ends up in the ICU in an isolation room with a with a disease he contacted in the Amazon literally destroying the organs in his body he said but Andrew or while he was testifying he told me later I forgot the pictures if you want to see him he said the scans were they were running scans and he said my lungs was leaving my body they were disappearing that that that that that disease was eating them up he said I was laying there praying and he says testifying he said I was laying there praying and I said God I got to have lungs to preach I got to be able to declare your word he said Lord I believe you're a Creator he said father would you come down right here and would you create a new set of lungs for me he said and I just breathed in just just took a real deep breath he said and it was a different breath he said it was a different breath he said the next day with Andrew they ran a scan he said and when they ran the scan they come in and said Mr Sonic we don't know what happened we ran several stands here's the scan yesterday his lungs was eat up to hear his lungs was leaving his body that scan showed a brand new set of created a brand new set of creative lungs a brand new set of them I thought oh my when he said that testify I said praise the Lord and when I said that brother I was sitting about there and all of a sudden this the spirit of God swept over me kind of like he did to him just kind of swept over me and I had my notebook out and I wrote down these words this is a creative meeting and I thought dear Lord why that I said I said this is a creative meeting and brother Thomas God is my witness the Holy Ghost spoke right out of me and I wrote it down as the Holy Ghost was giving it to me this is a creative meeting and cancer is trespassing on Creative lungs I wrote it down I still got it cancer is trespassing on Creative lungs and when I said that I thought oh dear God this meeting is the same meaning that brother Ron Spencer was preaching in 2000 or but this brother was pitched in 2009 and he just come to the fire and brother Ron's lungs was destroyed and he stands up Harbor The Edge preaching and God creates a new set of lungs in his body y'all just forgive me a brand new set of lungs and here's a man in the Pulpit nearly 10 years later testifying that the same God that created the Heaven to the earth created lungs in his body and we're fishing to hear of the Ron preach and he's going to preach from those lungs that were creative but now the devil says he's got lung cancer so in the back room being the guy I am I said brother Ron I said I want to ask you something I said do you mind if I share some of your testimony he said bro you go right ahead I said well I just want to share this portion I started my about to test one in his lungs and I said brother if it's okay I want to share that explainer he said you share it he said and let me give you something else you might want I promise you I'm down here he said let me give you something else you might won't I said I'll take all I can get he said the other day they ran scans on my lungs he said when they ran them scans he said the doctors come in there and said Mr Spencer you have one and cancer but here's the difference said your lungs are so powerful that the cancer cannot get in the lungs he said the tumors are hanging on the lungs I said oh mercy ouch don't you tell me that my God is not a Creator he created those lungs and you say why'd you say that because I said that to say this God created those lungs and the devil ain't strong enough to get into what God created so because he's a trespasser he cannot get in him so he'll trespass on them but you know what I stand here tonight to say that devil has no legal rights you know I'm preaching to you right now some of you all the devil is not in your marriage but he's hanging on it he's not in your babies but he's hanging on them he's not in your church but he's hanging on it but tonight by the
