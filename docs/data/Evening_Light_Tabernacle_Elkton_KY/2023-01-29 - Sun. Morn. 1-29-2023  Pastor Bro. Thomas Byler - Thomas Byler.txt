TRANSCRIPT
========================================
19. trust in the Lord do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and merely Thou shalt be fed thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass rest in the Lord and Lead patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass foreign Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth his day is coming your sword shines her into their own heart for the arms of the wicked shall be broken so you may be seated but Braun Warner Brothers and Sisters you know there's a thing the word of God is uh I'm gonna try to print brother cook he's on in the morning on the radio station um he's one of those type of preachers or teachers that takes I mean one of those scriptures your mind will start bringing back other places in the Bible where and it was just some things let me go to this place the eighth verse it says and and I find myself as I get older I don't know if it's part of getting older or not that or it's my father's genes in me I find myself getting angry or quicker not being able to put things away as quick as I used to do when I was a young man but this ain't verse comes I'll start at the seven patiently for him in which they'll be living right now patiently waiting for the Lord to lead and guide you there's so much out there to make you run different directions but Patiently Waiting In Christ for God to show you the way to go and he goes I just lost my place again and not myself because of him who prosper in his ways because the man who bring this last one cease from anger and that really natural coming out of your voice but really in the age of we live in is the thoughts that we are evil you need to spend more time pushing those away if you push those away in your mind and in your heart you won't speak those kind of words to other people or to your family but if you would also I was with charm with me to Isaiah the 54th chapter you know I can spend hours at mine everyone here knows whether that mind of Christ is Christ and the only way that you can have that very mind or have that very experiences I read that this is a short chapter here this morning you know what I was I have something here that I've been in my office you know I'm rearranging you know with me and Jeanette or downsizing and there's a lot of stuff you know over the years you build up things over the years before you realize that you got an office full of stuff that really doesn't mean anything to you anymore and somehow life is a lot of stuff on us that really we shouldn't stuff that we have you know in our lives or I know for myself I need to unload a lot but um I'll read this chapter in Isaiah oh everyone that thirsts has Come Ye to the waters and he that have no money Come Ye and buy and eat and come and buy wine melt without money and without price you know and that it's the same problems for all of us this morning everything that God is going to give you or what you desire to have from the lord it's free all you have to do is come and drink and come and possess it it goes on to say wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread or your labor for that which sound heart and diligently onto me ee that looks good and let your soul Delight in its in fatness you know that's the very word of God that's the presence of Jesus Christ that the table spirit for for me for any of us this morning it's free it's open and you can come and get as much in a natural way that you 've got to be willing to submit yourself incline your ear and come on to being here in your social to the people in the new Nazis I'll run in unto thee because of Lord thy God for the Holy One riserable and for His Glory by thee seek can be found called I mean that scripture people have it on on plaques in their houses but it doesn't change the truthfulness of that scripture you know this is the time when we need to seek them this is the time where the founders coming a day soon where God won't be found anymore and those that are righteous will be Crystal and those that are filthy will be filthy still and it says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man's thoughts that goes what I was saying in the beginning you know I you all know that the messages brother Brown and preaches it's your favorite thoughts that speak louder this is your mind kind in your thoughts and you can't hide that from them so whatever those thoughts are that possess you 24 hours a day that's who you really are that's who people abundantly you know that doesn't change God is more than able to meet your need to forgive your sins to if you'll forsake your wives and he goes on to say for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the Lord for as the heaven 's are higher than the Earth's sorrow my way is higher than your ways and my thoughts than your time you know the only righteousness that you possess is what God gives you you know you can't make yourself righteous anything good about you or anything righteous about you in a Christian saying doesn't come from your own ways but it comes John tether but the waters the Earth and makers they bring forth to the eater so shall my word be that God forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that would I please and it shall prosper in the things where I understand and like I was saying in the beginning as you read that 11th verse you know that you you can go back to John you know from the 8th to the 12th chapter this place is in Matthew you can go was in and then he goes you shall go out with joy and let forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth and before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hand instead of thorns shall come up fur trees instead of an abundance I don't have a lot to say this morning I was just gonna I was going for Sunday school before and this is well I don't know how long this could have been 20 years ago it could have been 15 years ago that's how much paperwork I had in my office but he as it's what what I was reading in the fifth and this uh Isaiah kind of speaks to what brother Brown simply have you all made your reservations this morning have you made you read the Salvation to being Heaven into being Glory you know I don't want to read a lot this morning this is in Paradox in Tampa Florida in 1964 April 18th they want to make a meeting this week and that's the same with us some of us it might have been a 40-year experience some of us it might have been a two-week experience your presence and they've known you're here that's not the start to think about man who brings a message again that's everyone here this morning that's the spirit of Christ who wants you to make that reservation this morning Bill got them over the river out of the ranch down into down into the vine into the root of tree if you Cherry and the end of the road they're yours lord it's between they're baptized with a Christian baptism then do it and then do that then be filled with the Holy Ghost the life that will guide you guide them for it is in the name of Jesus Christ

I'm getting new [Music] [Applause] [Music] can I see his face [Music] stories [Music] [Music] hey man good brother Tommy an opportunity to do something he's been wanting to do for a while he was just kind of waiting to message would that be okay everybody got plenty of time today it happened in between everybody can come hey man let's have all family together and they give us the testimony share with us with God he's appreciate you for the time God bless you want to share you know got to think in the day you know that like you know I was kind of like Legion or the one that your temper drugs Alcohol Tobacco you name it and you know I was standing here before you you know you deliver me completely for medication I got two months old and uh so my nerves a little bit more more nervous I can tell you I know that it the the medication I was on kind of like suppressing adrenaline glands man so I was a drilling donkey saw I'm glad myself you know but I I just uh a few things on my mind I always want to paint a picture to you today I've been staying on God was praying about it yesterday and I didn't really know where to start but you know in my like I said my idea was Faith or fear and my devotional yesterday was titled Faith versus reality I'm like well you know that's a good place as they actually exist as opposed to an idealistic or not God ever is a reality if you haven't met him then for all you that know I could be a pen name I am saying oh I will do and you have the reality that I am real believer Elizabeth faith in God will do what he promised it is on the basis that we continue to walk in the word every day and hoping is coming at the Rapture remember today that you walk in belief Christ is one of their people sitting here tonight that was one wheelchairs a night or two ago they're walking around now and and depending on what what you look at if you're looking at your Affliction you'll never go on influences of God you got that you got the right to ever the bless and God's promises are not as though they were because God said so amen I love that you know I like brother Ron you know brother Ron Spencer was sharing a testimony on your back and you you start grassing that's the way I was and it's growing my relationship deeper with him because I found more ways that he can actually talk to me it seemed like left to here you know and I don't believe you got to be on a deathbed experience to start reaching out for God to start speaking to you in more ways you know that atmosphere God can he'll feel welcome to come and be with you you know and I just love that because me and my friend was talking it was about two months ago before I thought we had to just get prayed for and uh too much stuff and I said you know my family was going to be leaving for weekend and going down to Florida and I was like you know what I was like I mean we know ultimately God is the one who draws a man and Pricks their heart you know that's if he wanted to we could do whatever we can do to just get an atmosphere just started dealing with me I started feeling like you know maybe it was you know I was going to create we're gonna have our own Revival you know and saying everyone wants to call your hand on everything I got up here and shared it myself part of that with the Thanksgiving thanks living testimony oh man it just gets you fired up thinking about so I I want to show the devil where I was standing so anyway this devotional really this is where I started really speaking to me he said uh there's a sergeant Hooper ran into the crossfire to save his uh his Fallen comrade Sergeant Hooper uh later became the most decorated son and women who will be willing to to bring the spiritual there I mean not just slump back in fear of the living but living a life uh slump raising children up in the fear of the Lord Living God and raising the standard on God's word praise the Lord keep fighting a good fight today because our Heavenly our Heavenly reward is not worthy to be accounted for for suffering that we experience in this life stand Toe to Toe with Satan and claim the victory keep fighting that god-given fight the testimony that little boy said you've got to do it you you've got to fight for every inch of ground Mark was Satan it's is that right isn't that right friend it's not a picking about this is right before I quit medication stuff uh he was talking about brother Branham there and you know down guys work so I started dealing with me and you know I was over with my wife there that God had been building my faith up and then and you know in in series events things that was happening in my life here you know in this recent this past year that he's building the faith of you know just like David and Goliath you know and it was molding me you know he didn't just throw him in the fire furnace he built their faith up before they was ready to you know tackle a task like that so you know and and you know I think that uh you know sometimes it's delivering I also I thought you know delivering I thought it might be an instantaneous thing that I would get you know like some other things in my life but you know next thing I know it was like I was speaking to me you know and you know and I say I'm here you know but it was like God speaking to me of like Peter you know he had to take God at his word step right there on that water Peter had to do it Peter had to take that step and you know it was just like you know God would show him and you know I of course I wouldn't encourage nobody to stop their medication about the Lord's leadership I had I had a desire to be medication free completely hope I believe anyone in here that wants to be free from medication or fear anxiety depression to back up doubt drugs alcohol anger yes you hate work you name it just start seeking the Lord praying asking for his Deliverance asking for Revelation taking mind his word you know get on that gospel like Moses said what he said I'm the Lord I got heals all thy disease that's what they had they didn't have no uh my machine's about to actually and everything else man you know but so I started searching the scriptures you know but anyway so that the day before here here's where it really really hit it home for me the guy was speaking to me there's more than a Jawbone laying here with you tonight laying next to you no more to do with it right I claim Jesus Christ's word right live or die I'm right with it that's right Total Line with him claim their god-given privileges everyone hasn't got uh it's a model or I can click on it hasn't got one privilege he hasn't got the legal power over any believer he's stripped and robbed at Calvary Jesus Christ robbed him over everything he had and and gave every believer a checkbook with his name on the bottom of it well so where are you asking my name that will I do it your personal opinion the name of Jesus Christ and use the name of Jesus Christ and stand back Hallelujah the Hallmark of heaven will declare it and I signed that there's second completely medicated aorta healing completely Victory complete Victory completely whole perfect blood pressure no medications and it says anything in John 14 14 if you shall ask anything in my name that will I do it you know so then it was like then I stepped out on God's word you know and and I was walking on the water you know I was streaming and fasting and I got to a point there that I'm like Lord you know I'm passing everything I'm like I don't want to be ignorant here I don't want to be getting out of your time in here this could be life the last time I was there if I ever be obligation he said no because I knew God's word I believe I'm going to be on medication he said you'll never be out medication by God's grace I got two months completely God's word says it I believe it man you know it must be the name of the Lord but anyway I said Lord I'm gonna be being ignorant right now I got a family I want to take care of I got things I want to do for you you know whatever you have me do Lord I just want to serve you because I love you you know and then it was like God he said on the sermon I screenshotted some stuff it says Grant and then ends up a burning punishment trying testing not only does he dick to profits but he does it to his children every son that cometh the God must be chasing and tried tested by his word and and when when he comes into a pension strong time when he faces death are you able to stand there on God's word and say God said God he called him the second man the name Moses a great games now this ain't that like we do and he said sometimes speak to the people and go forward my if there'd be ever a time to look the Lord I don't want to be ignorant and he said there's retreating God for me he said there's no retreat and God go forward the doctor says it's cancer go forward he says it's TB go forward he says it's the devil you can't get us up go forward see man oh Jesus Christ can set you free today I don't care what it is you know he said a brother once told me I said you know I heard this I said he said he said if you notice either ain't nothing on your back because he said there's no retreat in God's Army we're only pressing forward we don't have to look back guys got our back we're going forward you know and there was a thing popped up said we will accept nothing else less than full Victory blessed be the name of the Lord you know looking over my life I'll take take Faith or fear last year for Corporation God visited that that night was dealing with me I opened my friend I needed something else too I loved it I flipped it again and said that my grace alcohol jealousy temper you name it right there blessed be the name of the Lord can't you think about life brother random one the guy coming up to the pulpit he said that's something come over and throw the ball out in the field oh something came over him what was it that I was reading and it was like God just quick ly uh taking God at his word if we can just look at it they can run with it you know it'll give you a piece of past understanding you know you can be you can be completely free from anything that you you're that you're you know uh blessing ain't as well of course but if we can just take it at face value you know and run brother Brown I'm gonna talk about you know pray for Rebel Lake boy it's just boy it changes everything we got to give you a little bit of Revelation you can run with it and just stay online it's just it's just it's live altering you know so that's why I pray pray for Malaysian like you said you know you know and I was just thinking when you think about the Simplicity of it you know he said thank God just think about it for a minute we was on his mind before the foundation of the world we are his thoughts made manifest he said if you abiding me I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and so right now all we're on is this is proving ground what are we doing we're going back to where we once was huh and when you think and you just take that little bit of a simple thought there I mean this is nothing but fake so alive everything's free and the reason why it's so it's so uh encouraging to know that you know when you're on facing that experiencing perspective you're going through you know so his head your protection will be there and he just gives you something you can stand on to know that I'm going uh thinking about Joe think about Joe when he said uh you know that waste a year of having a servant he told me to do all this but that is knowing that if you are where you are today you're already done all you can do what God allowed him to do to you so you know you know God's got you you know and I really like this brother Lawson deal with the devil you know he decided to come over my shoulder and say you know you ain't you ain't you ain't bro you ain't saved you ain't got the Holy Ghost you know it goes on and this and that and he said you know I started so I started letting him know so I believe all y'all out there can start waving them you start waving and telling him you know I love you you ain't have enough that's why I'm here and I stand on God's word you know I'm thinking about that little story the birds whistling and praising God and just being happy and Lord saying you know they must not have a Heavenly Father Like We Do you know you know and you just think about it and he's like they must not know their Heavenly Father and to and to not fear and to see I wish I could just tell them the scripture right here like Luke 4 Jesus saying he said and he opened the book blessed be the name of the Lord he opened the book to us he from the he found the place Lord as upon me before he had sent me to heal the birdie them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he closed the book and gave it again to the minister blessed be the name of the Lord what do we got we got an open book that he's giving us the revelations oh but we're done that's not how many began to say this day in the scriptures filled in your ears huh and I just love that you know he came to set the captives free break all the bonds and he lost sicknesses we no we are free the cross is settled settled it paid every debt you owe you're free you can stand on where God's word so it's God's word I believe it God's Gonna help Sword Fight for Your Life stand on God's promises foreign God admire a man that will step out like that amen toe to Mark the devil it tells you you'll never be off it'll kill you then for you to throw your medication away hey man that's stepping out isn't it man and like he said You Want To Be Inspired of God to do that amen we led by God to do that but if you get a revelation from God you can do that amen probably you know I need to step out I need to just step out and say I believe I'm healed amen just like this diabetes diabetes the devil tries to put on me and stuff and amen and uh you know by God's grace I don't have to take any minute once in a while I will if I eat too much like the wrong thing but I'm believing it's going to get better and better and better and better I'm not looking to just have to do this all my life amen if you don't expect better and different it's never going to be in it so thank you brother Tommy and man God bless you this morning let's stand amen and we'll sing to this missile something oh look I thought it's been good to me now to the Lord isn't it we already encouraged right we already got some from the Lord and I really wanted to do in one service but we're just going to put it in whatever gear one system uh God wants to put it and go uh as long as God wants us to go on this I mean I highly doubt that I can get through with it tonight or just today and then maybe Wednesday and then if it goes longer than that that's fine too amen but uh something that I've wanted to speak on for a few weeks and I've got something else I've been wanting to speak on for a little while and just waiting for the inspiration to do so amen and just the right time I guess waiting on the Lord but this morning I want to take this one thought amen and uh see if the Lord won't just help me to try to bring this to you as I feel the Lord has given it to me amen and I thought about titling this I thought about titling this but patient and subtraction amen but hey man we're going to title title it a little bit something different and call it for you Lord Jesus and once again Lord grateful Lord Jesus to be in your presence Lord and to be at the house of God father to lay aside all the cares of Life Lord and no worry the different things we have to forget about during the week sometimes Lord and just to gather together with your children father we would desire God that you'll have your way into service father help us Lord to be completely surrendered to you so that you can say what you once said father to your people let the spirit speak to the people this morning Father we ask God that Jesus bless every portion of the service now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen I want to say it's good to see you brother and sister Martha back again I know they would go on vacation different things amen and brother Troy it's Robin good to see them amen we had to reread introduced this morning brother David did you know but anyways it's good to see them get to have them back and get to see the house full this morning and everybody in amen it's always good I think in this week it's always good to see you sitting in your place amen amen me in my place and then the Lord to come down and shape his molars into his image and what he wants amen and I'm certainly do thank you for your prayers amen for I covet your prayers and for the leadership of the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us we know we're in a very late hour isn't it right we believe there is rapturing faith in this message amen and we know that God's going to be doing something in our age in our time God's going to be doing something amen and I believe it's going to be getting us ready for his coming amen as that time draws close amen and so I call it the chain of our character but you remember to quote but I'm made about a chain being its strongest at its weakest link amen so we want to speak about that a little bit we want to talk about that weak link but first we want to talk about also we want to talk about the links amen would that be all right we want to look at the links and then we want to see if they have any weak links amen and I certainly believe that it'd be a time when we could repeat what brother bam said about the reason that we come together to get together is not to see our strong places but to see our bad places is that right and to see where we can get closer to God and where we can change a little amen amen so I appreciate that brother Tommy amen certainly appreciate his faith in the Lord if you will uh turn to Second Peter second Peter like I said we could take a sermon on those three thoughts on addition multiplication and subtraction amen because how many knows that it is this life is like going to school amen we're being taught something we're being tutored by a teacher isn't that right amen we have to graduate you know how many believe that we got to graduate we've got to come to the place that we congratulate amen and be ready for what lays amen and getting this ready for the Millennium uh and to be with the Lord Jesus Christ throughout all eternity amen so these links are found if you want to turn to First Peter 1. Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them who have obtained like Precious Faith like you know God loves multiplication he loves addition but he don't tax that out of your life and pretty soon your backslid why because the Devil he's the one master of subtraction but there is some things that we need to need to subtract out of our lives and found in Hebrews where it says lay side every way amen any beliefs we need to lay aside those there's things we need to get rid of Amen get out of here Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God I like that as you know God and as you get more knowledge in God grace and peace is to be multiplied to you I like that amen verse 3 according as his divine power has given unto glory and virtue and whereby are given done to us exceeding great and precious promises and that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen we'll stop there and let you be seated because I want to just amen pick up on this for just a minute with the help of the Lord amen I mean how many loves the Lord this morning amen God is certainly good and I just will do so when we get in a hurry he says then you'll just ruin the things that you're going to say amen I believe we need to slow down just a little bit amen [Music] how many believe you gotta preach under inspiration be directed by the Holy Spirit and say that we have already of many heard many times but I've just quite a bit I mean a few uh Sunday Sundays to go when we spoke on 20 going forward man he calls it a teaching message and it is kind of you know you know but he goes in these talks about escaping the corruptionist in the world Amen taking us out of the corruption that is in the worlds and besides this because um this has to do this is who God made you because if not you're going to find yourself manufacturing something we're not here to manufacture anything aren't you glad you don't have to be a fake amen coming to the church and feel like you're a hypocrite another because we realized he said you know that perishes the golden God is that Christ's life came we came into the world but naked spiritually we we're not going to leave me you're gonna take something with you amen I mean the character of Christ but even the unbelievable the same as he came when he is he leaves either with uh we as a Christian leave with Christ but all a sinner goes with a whole pile of on him they had a funeral because you're not necessarily caring about how much money that person made how rich they are just think about when they look down at your face they're looking about who you are what that's what we're here for this morning we want to look at what our week because he said and I've got a quote here let me just they're listening ear a chain is its strongest at its weakest oh my may God search us out this morning this morning as I said that no doubt you person had a weak link because what happened [Music] the promised land because you did something you ought to do amen not somebody with us today very careful we have a week I'm not going to take let you go to the car he says get thee behind me no stronger than this weakness no matter how strong these other things are built up if you've got a week so we're gonna start with the help of the Lord let's just start with the first one because realize that the first one that he talks about he says give all diligence now let me let me let me go ahead a little bit Tarzan would that be okay there's tens it says where for the rather Brethren give sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall uh you're right by the time somebody there's presidents popping he found huh is that baby popular people they're not supposed to fall that was the devil's there to trip you up and you're only gonna be let me say this out you're only gonna be as strong as your weakest Place Lord help me Lord help you to be strong and strengthen that because we all need to be stronger how many is with me be Overcomers stand like Paul said heavens and all that but all the best played on pause and Ephesians but that was you in the morning to do with you because the public God said what I'm glad that a man can live so close to God that to do with you and he knows what your weak link is oh more than you know every time you get to go and as a spiritual Christian if you've got a shortcoming a failure somewhere and used to pull all the devil will abuse you he'll tell you look at y'all weak you know and you'll be there and you'll moping yourself and your depression come on people be honest so Lord help us amen my my foreign again lust for money lust for big things Lust For popularity things prevent to the believer we don't care a tent or a cottage squash I can't live or die sink or drown I mean uh somebody that throws their pills somebody like by the man I'm gonna eat this I don't care if he killed me he didn't give me left he didn't care not gonna take all of these words all right never die say this one that's just fine even brother man's mother died so don't eat that bill I guess the doctor said he's gonna kill him he throwing it up load it up let me let me let me as a pastor Pro evangelist God speaking to you about things you'll never get real victory that it's just a mental it's just an intellectual understanding but the prophet of God says if that's all you've got to go with that repeat it repeat it repeat it repeat it until it becomes a revelation to it amen and on it that's the only way you'll ever get anything from God so he says here all indeed thanks around this is the thing yes let me maintain him of Glory I may believe God 's goal his ambition was I don't care family likes my home likes my my farm likes my this that the other but I don't want Christ to lock in my life he had an impatient he wanted to make sure that Christ was the preeminent one preeminent one in his life how are we that he was with me this morning I'll tell you this right now I believe that this is what causes Us in cool mold as the shape us into being the Rapture because that's really all what we're really concerned about this morning is to be ready it's hard but we're dumber than we ever were I mean come on we don't know what he was when we got I was going to say it people on the Supreme Court and everything else they asked well what is the woman for I don't know if you don't know what a man and woman is you're not very smart whatever knowledge you claim to have it ain't very smart why because the devil's knowledge is is stupidity only one real knowledge and that's a knowledge of the Lord amen anyway that's just a little touch of knowledge anyway s that's right whether I mean any of that oh my God let Christ's virtue his knowledge flow out that I'm not be able to teach those for God has set an attraction to the coming of the Lord praise be to God now notice I even Peter said that these things be in you and about how they'll make you that you're neither unfruitful nor and God you gotta have these things how many believes it we got to happen give all diligence to you your favor Faith virtue now notice the first thing of course we realize faith can we talk about that for just a minute I'm gonna believe that without faith it's impossible to please God I'll even be born again without faith it takes believing God's word for you to get a new birth that's right without so forth It's the evidence of Things Not Seen and without faith it's impossible to please him for you to cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him we realize that the elders obtained again depart through faith and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God there is nothing as powerful as God revealing something to you that's faith how many notes but I've said that faith is a revelation it's something that God quickens to you you can take those pills and you can dump them out you can call them and laugh in the doctor's face if he tells you he's going back if you really have a revelation from God that you're gonna live you want Faith it's the very Foundation of Christianity it's a foundation I notice here that he's only the foundation it's on the very bottom it's like the footer of the house everybody says it's not a Pentecost amen and the faith of God to do a work and get out too oh I got it he said you ain't got nothing you just got started and God wants to build all these things into US faith that our Elder said I want the faith that Abraham had you got to have that and I do believe that I have it and I do not be all right he loved him just more to uh find it here now we've escaped investing this to the church now that's why we are here this morning is to find out what that way is what is God's requirements there's not a person in here that look loves God but what once more like Christ and you might be like Christ I am UAV but yet there's you still have someone to be in you I want to be more like him isn't that right she says no matter how Christian how much you love God you still want to be more like Christ and he's laid it out of every Christian he says I'm an old veteran and since your kid here they're probably the oldest in the building but if I'd ask them what is your emergency fire that seem to be closer to God to be more like him yeah when you yearn for Christ there's something about it amen how many believe that this morning it hurts his eye even the brother Joe's prayer Lord give us the mind of Christ we want to see more like him I may believe you're not only can sing like him but you got a life like him you can have faith to get me like yep oh my God oh praise be to God but as brothers calls us we're all just a bunch of Sinners born and sin-shaped iniquity that kind of condition and that we ourselves can prostrate ourselves give some not had life out and put Christ's life in take amen our old Thomas Fowler you yourself take yourself out and put God in the works that I understand you do also don't you have a yearning to see that manifest that's them all amen he was gonna be a burning up learning and I saw to be more like him less of ourselves and more of him I'm gonna see him every day in my life don't you every hour than me because there's still too much or take that transfusion and that's what we are Amen Let the Lord get you in the good old IV right in here all right and another one over here where it goes out at and get that other old life out and put his life on the inside that's what we come to church for is to get the blood and praise the Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah wisdom patience and all that whenever Jerry brat Bell preached on this 30 some years ago I remember when he did I remember when he brought these quotes up isn't that right he's long gone out life is scattered into the Four Winds and everything else sad isn't it amen the devil wants to try to hurt your faith by that but it does not a real believer amen do not go with me yet still will I follow amen but so he listens to have people have a certain part does you have you have so many links aren't even filled you may be strong in one part but you're never going to be sure just because you're naturally nice and kind of was it real quick he talks about it it's uh you know like putting uh he says if you're back where he only displaces himself he says better stay a blackbird he says when he tries to question he just simply all out of and I'm gonna say it again when we don't possess the things that we confess we are nothing but a big stomach everybody said to everybody else doubt by either believing God and that is I noticed even the better Bible says you know what the thing that we're going to take is take with us is what we are I am late so when you get over there you're gonna take great faith with you you're going to take virtue with you you're going to take God's knowledge with her had a capsule of perfect love that's the character of the believer I mean I was the same way with the fruit of the spirit love Joy foolish amen I just want to say this morning I believe that it is time for us to strengthen that weak link that weak link that place where you're not where you ought to be you can only do that through prayer and belief in stepping out off the boat and saying I believe God's going to take it from me I believe God's going to give me a power he's going to give me power to take back the time that it takes for me to pray because the devil had robbed me of it huh maybe you don't love the Lord like you used to that's your warning more than you ever have or less I mean believe this is but that's about it me I'm about you don't need a college degree he didn't it's all what you said to your mind too much love to work if you want to get into your life anything or you better work huh would you be lazy uh that look that's part of the character isn't it I think that you think about the things that you get Domino wait that's what builds it amen praise be to God first find I want you to understand that just is one thing just this one thing called faith is something that has to be aren't you glad that you talk about Supreme it was uh because if you don't you'll only have an intellectual and if that's all it ever is all it ever stays huh when God said come on up here I want to show you I want to have a conversation with you you talk about nothing Paul was the opposite he was minus he wasn't E minor said Paul Paul ourselves forever Tommy's experiencing the jailhouse you'll never forget that personal experiences you forever didn't even brother bam says you know once you meet Jesus you'll never be the same and there goes both ways it was with the Rich Young Ruler remember he came into contact with Jesus he was never to see me he got richer and bigger barns but his soul was found in hell it was never the same but when God does work of Grace in your life and he gives you Faith to believe God it changes you this where the Lord said Glory You're Gonna Hear Thomas saying I can take the time God children Abraham's children Abraham you have you and your wife are Baron you've had no children but but he believed it believe that anyhow he knew that he was not just a sideshow or whatever that's not what God promised I promised that I would have it by Sarah huh that's right and he knew it would come God put it until it looked like it would never be able to 90 some years old so Lord help me how many would say look God add to my add to me give me that came up to that great big giant blast called diabetes called blood pressure call Diana she's just wanting to feel but you're a rascal here amen that is defying the armies of the Living God paying for trouble ice cause God is going to deliver you into my hands huh I'm tired of being weak I didn't have no joy in my life I'm tired of him coming every year and robbing me like he did shamed off every year coming and the things that are as though they are those things that are not as they are God said it I believe it that's sinless give me the oh deliver my people thank you what did Moses see when he went there he saw his people free that's what he saw yeah God told him he was going to deliver his people how to kill these Adams They're Gonna Change in the moment in the twinkling of an eye changing me from glory to glory he's changing me his word his likeness an image to perfect in me are you every day he's working amen unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ without any weak links amen he says that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every window Doctrine but this Foundation when you're born again you're just about some growing and God is what sent the pastor to be your tutor beautiful no he's there to be your Shepherd that right to Shepherd you to lead you and guide you but the real tutor is the Holy Ghost because I can gamble and then they said happened to you I'm not there but he is he's the one that is that's I like that brother you know whenever he was you grasped you ever you're looking for God to talk to foreign [Laughter] Lord speak to my heart [Music] did you ever do that to you you know to me he said okay you know let's start you want to hear from me come on a little bit I'll be honest with you but God's working on me hey man let's start here with the basics let's just start here you wanna because he's your tutor add to your faith keep adding not subtracting God wants our Grace our knowledge of him to be multiplied he wants your stature to both same plateau isn't that a good question are you staying in the same place are you still not just like you always was into the stature and into the image of Jesus Christ well that's what it takes I'm gonna go ahead it's wood and stone and they're all put together with the sound of it without the sound of a hammer and he's not in Solomon's Temple anymore he's building a temple for himself heaven and that's you the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen and the God is trying to get Tabernacle for us to live in amen praise be to God because she wants to live in you and in me praise the Lord that's the very Foundation of Christianity then you begin to grow then you start better bams as you know the greatest hymnic first hymns you ever liked is to be like Jesus to like Jesus the virtue and they passed it I don't say listen virtue when I've cried she just touched the Hem of His Garment and he fed straight going out of it and I'll tell you that of the Holy Spirit minister the people that strength is just going on I'm ready for rest now and virtue goes out you have something to give but Advance calls it a power a strength and every Christian should have that strength come on people it's gone Amen in order in the state but we don't not today he says that's the way it is a lot of Queen right no but give strength someone was caught in the very of that amen that's virtue amen if I don't even believe in the power of God days of Miracles this past there's no such a thing of the Holy Ghost how'd you like to go to a church that way it was only for the apostles oh my God I'd have to go somewhere else Molly God help us the world needs some Godly knowledge smartest people in the world supposed to be but yet act the dumbest we all sitting here at our Christians are flabbergasted aren't we at the city we're just amazed at the ignorance and stupidity you're going to build how about religious how about in the religious Realms huh brother Brown says you know the knowledge between the judge right no that's not judging right from wrong they don't even know and they'll call it the algebra fortunately foretelling is of the devil um and you say that it'll never be forgiven judge right from wrong we are better man he said now we'll have to hurry so we won't go hurry too much but Temperance is the next thing temperance temperance ill well if you feel I could do it you know people do what do you want they don't have self-control drinking and doing those things but he says holy ghost temperance he says those other things are just the one wait till we get in we'll get into it yet but that has to do with that love thing up there right well I got perfect love but I'm sure I'll tell you what that I'll I won't mention names but I know people that'll almost wait till they're better hands called that a mule man you slap that he'll kick you in the head if you possibly can't turn the other seat amen control your tongue don't be a Tattler another place he talks about you know uh every time somebody speaks this crossbow across to you oh boy listen listen none of us are going to fall off right there because we get started then we wonder wouldn't you when we get completely surrendered and we have these things and the way that we're supposed to have you just watch good to see preachers raising up giving their lives to the Lord so somebody say you bunch of Holy Rollers don't jump roll up your sleeves [Laughter] oh my see you talk about Godly love Cameron's kind rolls into perfect love also you know even those people let veterans come in here every one of us that have gotten The Temper of God upset know that when you get that type of that you do the wrong thing and if you ever get you got to make that right you gotta say I was wrong brother I lost my temper I acted in the wrong way I said the wrong thing ain't no way amen that you're gonna do the right thing say the right thing when you lose your temper don't let it do what it wants to do make it come subject to What God Says amen that's true temperance amen what's the next amen do it hurry up great I got intention right until just lately since I ain't been in construction and all that I thought the boys boys because I'm you're right yeah and I I keep trying to assure him I'm slowing down I'm not in a rush I'm taking it easy now I believe we all got to work on it Lord help me give me patience and we can say much because we know Abraham had to wait five years no I had to wait 120 years for the problem come to pass the Bible says that we should look to those who through patience in this but if you just keep hanging on just wait on God Daniel had to wait 21 days you don't know how warning I was thinking of how long it was that Noah had to wait 120 years I and and you think about it brother Brandon was born in 1909 isn't that right and it would be 120 years we're not far from that time 120 years get ready I'm just kidding you on that he'd be ready this morning if you've heard so many dates and things my biggest day in the world 2012 yeah just be ready isn't that right just be ready but it is something that would be about the same time Mama all our patients how many believe we got to have patience patience for the BAM says with one another to forgive one another have a call within 30 minutes I forgave you forgive them you think they believe in one God there's Trinity they were still based they couldn't learn how to get along and realize you're going to see things a little bit different huh it's a seven seal one place certain time and I say that oh boy I get all kinds of facts for saying that I get Flack for saying what brother bam said and saying with what brother Brown said oh man people come up no it's completely open nice to go look their face did you tell me what brother bam said was not open what was it I don't know the gun shut up that's what I told him but they told me to go to the store to bot went to two different story about this is you got to call them to buy no sir I absolutely selling that that product because that that signal enhance it because they haven't sold it in over a year a lady yesterday's tickets look to me that I get back today and if needless to say it I don't get that way with my sometimes it's a little afraid you know impatient this morning appropriate one thing that patience have her perfect work that you may be entire that you may be perfect and entire wanting or lack multiplication before such River Christ bring me to the full stature of Crisis God's what the god Bible wants me to get I don't cry let him work patience in you brother Troy knows all about it I know all of them going through files at last years not a day no week not a month years huh anybody that's ever been through amen patience he says when the brother Jason got Bob Terror still got amen now let's just say this comes to mind foreign we had it messed up doing stuff anyways the other girls that do it she got blamed she kangaroo court and everything else oh yeah all wrong come on folks we know what I did I'm gonna do this idea I believe that's okay but definitely be patient not so judgmental we like to just condemn them and put them he looked in a bunch of dictionaries to find out what God in this was he says and is Christ's likeness I want to be able to walk and such be Godlike and he says now as you can do all these things what you have all coming in to Perfection amen now he also has brother another and be kind one to another remember what just has a new commanded affection one to another I mean please our neighborliness loving one another and so forth brotherly kind and then of course last we'll just touch here for just a minute we were like it's the Capstone capping of it all which is God himself but he said he had little lines drawn all all down through here because if you're gonna ever uh I sure don't like this person in such a weird moment somewhere in fifths she chapter he talks about you know if you uh be kind to those that person he says do good to them nothing you even Paul said I have all knowledge amen says fighting this you got a weak link somewhere the whole Spirit don't do that somebody wants to start argue about scriptures as well if you can't see it we don't talk about this up and down we don't try to absolutely prove that we're right no we know what we're fighting and we can have that confidence that you ain't Lord help us in these things or no matter what it is in your life this morning if you'll stand with me character doesn't need shouldn't have we think and if they're tweak with our heads bowed raise it to Jesus raise it to him say God no brother Byler don't know maybe nobody else what in power could be just anything lukewarmness whatever it is something that always kind of takes you away from God raise your hands to God I want to explore don't let me have that weakness and have it how they have to step out of the boat you got to stop their Scottish mine you got to tell the line with the devil and I believe God that you'll strengthen here every week link this morning Father after you God we love you love everything and even as you profits for whether I maintain my whether I maintain my family and that's very important whether any is the kind of character he had so when he preached that he knew what he was talking about last Friday with his father for our sins and our failures Lord Jesus when we're still not on fire like we should be and whatever area it is Lord we ask God cause closer Lord we want one or two [Music]
