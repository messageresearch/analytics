[0:52] um
[0:55] [Music]
[1:05] [Music]
[1:37] [Music]
[1:51] [Music]
[1:58] so
[2:13] so
[2:22] [Music]
[2:28] [Music]
[2:31] this morning
[3:16] uh
[3:45] [Music]
[3:54] is covered
[4:09] all right
[4:24] unto the lord
[4:40] our hiding place thou shalt preserve me
[4:44] from thou shalt compassion devour
[5:20] r
[5:50] god
[6:18] um 23rd chapter
[6:23] i had an experience yesterday you know
[6:26] how many of you had those experiences
[6:28] before you started
[6:41] [Music]
[6:55] several hours later i happen to go back
[6:57] and do it and do it the right way and
[6:59] that's the same way you know people
[7:01] sometimes
[7:02] in our lives help us to do this
[7:05] and then we'll take over everyone knows
[7:08] what takes over now reasoning
[7:10] away from melody
[7:12] take over
[7:19] and then several situations later you'll
[7:21] go back and say well i should have done
[7:23] this at this time and things would have
[7:25] been whole much better you know
[7:28] being less
[7:43] this is going to give you and you know
[7:45] you should listen to it but if that
[7:47] voice is
[7:48] you know like a you're a film but that
[7:50] line was reflected off of god's word and
[7:53] you know you should be doing that
[7:56] um mean i'm going to read this whole
[7:58] chapter pretty wrong
[8:01] i mean i'll probably read the first
[8:03] verse here
[8:05] but i was thinking this morning uh i'll
[8:08] let you agree that's been said jesus
[8:10] because of all the food and to the
[8:12] disciples saying
[8:14] the scribes and the pharisees sit in
[8:16] both his teeth all therefore whatsoever
[8:18] they need you to observe that observe
[8:21] and do
[8:22] but do not be having their work for they
[8:24] say
[8:42] [Applause]
[8:52] shoulders but they themselves will not
[8:55] move them with one of their things
[8:57] that's a that's a lot of like
[8:59] photography they like putting burdens on
[9:01] them but for all their work
[9:03] when they've seen a man they make
[9:05] broader
[9:06] they give my conscience
[9:22] [Music]
[9:28] upon the earth for one is your father
[9:31] which is in heaven
[9:32] maybe you be called master for one of
[9:34] your masters
[10:03] few chapters here
[10:04] but i was thinking this morning
[10:08] let me go back here
[10:12] what's the difference between the
[10:14] disciples
[10:15] and the pharisees and what's the
[10:17] difference between you and any other
[10:19] believer in the world that we live in
[10:21] and that's that's life you know the
[10:23] world is full of darkness
[10:25] and the only difference between you and
[10:27] everyone else god is showing a blind
[10:33] [Applause]
[10:43] these scriptures that deal in it's not a
[10:46] physical document but the spirit of god
[10:48] and that the world that we live in is
[10:50] pretty darn plain sort of spiritual and
[10:54] uh worldly pathogens where people just
[10:56] don't want to see the truth and just
[10:58] prefer to live in their lives the way
[11:00] they are but i'll just read some
[11:02] scriptures here that deal with that
[11:04] and it's if you have constantine
[11:06] references on page 13
[11:09] and in isaiah the 59th chapter on the
[11:11] 10th first
[11:45] and the only place for us to be is in
[11:46] the light of the gospel for the hour of
[11:48] the living and then in matthew 15
[11:51] chapter 14
[11:54] i just jesus tell them about the
[11:56] religious beliefs that they choose to be
[11:58] blind and controlling truth
[12:00] you know you can't you can't make them
[12:02] believe something they just have to
[12:04] reach out to faith and believe it let
[12:06] them alone be making fun of the body
[12:13] but i was thinking about
[12:15] these two scriptures in corinthians here
[12:18] uh
[12:19] it goes on to say here in
[12:22] of uh second corinthians of corinthians
[12:24] 3rd chapter and the 14th verse
[12:28] but if their minds were blinded drawn to
[12:30] this day remaining the same veil i'm
[12:32] taken away in the reading
[12:34] of the old testament which mel has done
[12:36] away in christ well you decide to stop
[12:39] vlogging this morning because you're not
[12:41] in a system
[12:42] where it doesn't let you receive
[12:44] anything you choose yourself and he goes
[12:46] on saying
[12:47] second corinthians the fourth chapter
[12:50] and the fourth
[12:51] in whom the god of this world has
[12:53] blinded their minds of them which
[12:55] believe not least the life of the glory
[12:57] of the gospel of christ who is the
[12:59] innocent of god should shine for them
[13:03] this morning between you and you're not
[13:06] believing
[13:07] god to shine this light onto you and in
[13:09] your heart and then ephesians before
[13:12] jacob in the 18th verse
[13:14] having me understand dartmouth being an
[13:16] alienated from the life of
[13:18] god figures
[13:20] in them because of the blindness of
[13:21] their hearts
[13:23] you know just
[13:24] a couple problems this morning i really
[13:26] don't have a lot to say you know there's
[13:28] no difference between you and a man next
[13:30] court other than god
[13:31] right on them you
[13:47] uh
[13:47] you just got to believe that it's the
[13:49] word of god and resonate effect you know
[13:52] i'm thinking there was pointing out
[13:53] sitting over there
[13:55] uh i forget to make sure that that says
[14:00] the difference between a believer
[14:02] there's two types of believers the one
[14:04] that's kind of reason everything out
[14:06] before you believe it and the other one
[14:08] that when you read distributed didn't
[14:10] believe it and move it in
[14:12] and we all have our different ways that
[14:15] we are there's that one
[14:17] first you know
[14:19] you've got to see everything you've got
[14:20] to put everything together just right
[14:22] for him to believe and then the other
[14:24] one it just it may just receive it and
[14:27] just believe it
[14:40] he was talking about
[14:41] it's like two kids when you get on the
[14:43] tour
[14:45] press the board it gives people a
[14:47] support there's only that one boy that
[14:49] has to take it all apart
[14:51] put it back together he's working play
[14:53] with it there's the other one
[14:56] that's the same way the bottom of this
[14:58] or wherever your eyes it's just the
[15:00] truth you just believe it and you have
[15:02] fun and if you play it there's always
[15:04] one when you get something because they
[15:06] have to figure it out before they can
[15:07] play with it and the other one you get
[15:09] the same choice
[15:24] you have
[15:39] love him this morning
[15:41] amen god is good isn't he am i stand and
[15:44] sing that little course if we could this

[1:00:10] it will be but we want to be faithful to
[1:00:12] the lord
[1:00:26] let
[1:00:54] again
[1:01:09] and sins
[1:01:13] wherein times pass you walked according
[1:01:15] to the course of this world according to
[1:01:16] the prince of the power of the air the
[1:01:19] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:01:20] of disobedience
[1:01:22] among whom also you have had your life
[1:01:25] or conversation in times past in the
[1:01:28] lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires
[1:01:31] of the flesh and of the mind and we're
[1:01:33] by nature the children of wrath even as
[1:01:37] others but god who is rich in mercy for
[1:01:40] his great father where when he loved us
[1:01:42] even when we were dead in sins and
[1:01:44] quickened us together with christ for by
[1:01:47] grace our key state
[1:01:49] it has raised development together and
[1:02:04] of sin and our conversations
[1:02:07] love the pleasure so
[1:02:18] tell you god has foreign been helping me
[1:02:21] father helping me inside that three four
[1:02:24] months we have some time
[1:02:28] open there's a spring
[1:02:30] yeah
[1:02:35] try that
[1:02:36] all right
[1:02:37] there we go
[1:02:39] amen there's a spring open that we can
[1:02:40] drink from
[1:02:42] amen that'll never run dry and it's
[1:02:44] always
[1:02:45] bubbling i mean it's always got
[1:02:47] freshness to it amen
[1:02:49] amen that's what we need
[1:02:51] now we've been speaking about amen um
[1:02:54] surrendering ourselves
[1:02:56] surrendering ourselves to the lord
[1:02:59] amen and
[1:03:01] uh dying to ourself
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:04] we forfeiting our rights
[1:03:06] how many believes that
[1:03:08] amen if you want more of god you're
[1:03:09] going to have to surrender more about
[1:03:11] not being halfway
[1:03:13] not being lukewarm
[1:03:15] but being a complete christian
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:22] i'll tell you what it really deserves
[1:03:24] more time on it don't but just uh nobody
[1:03:28] you know because there's nothing more
[1:03:29] miserable
[1:03:30] amen there's nothing no worse state to
[1:03:33] be than on defense
[1:03:36] you know a little of this and a little
[1:03:38] that that just doesn't work well the
[1:03:40] christian law with god doesn't work
[1:03:42] right when you're not 100 committed
[1:03:46] when it's not 100
[1:03:48] and it just ends up in misery
[1:03:51] but on the other hand we talked about
[1:03:53] what it's like when you are submitted to
[1:03:55] god
[1:03:56] when you come to this place but i want
[1:03:58] to back up and read a quote and i don't
[1:04:00] know don't know that i ever read this
[1:04:02] one the other last sunday i guess it was
[1:04:05] and i meant to because i was talking
[1:04:07] about completely surrendering ourselves
[1:04:09] to god and brother bannon he was talking
[1:04:12] about all the revivals that we've had
[1:04:15] all the people the hundreds of people
[1:04:17] that go to the polls perhaps and pray
[1:04:19] and do these things and so forth and he
[1:04:21] says look at where it's at now look at
[1:04:24] where all those folks are
[1:04:26] and he makes the statement what good did
[1:04:28] it do it really didn't do any good
[1:04:31] he was very negative about what good it
[1:04:34] did
[1:04:35] because of the fact that those people
[1:04:38] doing that they were just partial about
[1:04:40] what they were doing
[1:04:42] they weren't completely surrendered
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:46] i'll tell you this right now when god
[1:04:48] himself comes down and a prophet like
[1:04:51] brother branham says now you know i
[1:04:52] can't deserve nobody's thoughts i i
[1:04:54] can't do anything and i'm just here
[1:04:56] waiting
[1:04:57] you know who i'm waiting on him
[1:05:00] the supernatural god himself to come
[1:05:02] down
[1:05:03] and then he would come down he'd begin
[1:05:05] to discern the thoughts and just like he
[1:05:07] did it with the woman at the well
[1:05:09] right
[1:05:10] and so forth and he began to manifest
[1:05:12] himself and so forth and then to think
[1:05:15] that people could walk away from that
[1:05:18] and call it mental telepathy or mind
[1:05:20] reading it's called and it's actually
[1:05:22] blasphemy
[1:05:24] because you call jesus says when the
[1:05:25] holy ghost comes and does these things
[1:05:27] you speak one word against that it will
[1:05:30] never be forgiven you not in this world
[1:05:32] or the world to come
[1:05:36] let me say something else that when you
[1:05:38] know the truth people that have been in
[1:05:39] this message and know the truth
[1:05:42] and then when you willfully listen when
[1:05:44] you willfully disbelieve this message
[1:05:48] huh
[1:05:50] brother ma'am said that willfully there
[1:05:52] remains no more sacrifice sin but
[1:05:56] abandoned called it blasphemy there is
[1:05:58] no forgiveness
[1:06:00] [Applause]
[1:06:01] if you disbelieve the truth if you've
[1:06:03] once believed it
[1:06:06] what a dangerous thing it is
[1:06:08] to walk away from the message look at
[1:06:10] all the blood
[1:06:15] and the crazy part
[1:06:17] is that these people will still be
[1:06:19] spiritual
[1:06:22] i don't understand it but they'll still
[1:06:24] act like they're spiritual
[1:06:27] most of the time these people that do
[1:06:28] this feel like they were above
[1:06:31] the prophet of god
[1:06:34] better than him knew more about it than
[1:06:37] that which is very scary
[1:06:40] i mean i was miriam
[1:06:42] one time
[1:06:44] one time they made fun of moses a little
[1:06:46] bit
[1:06:48] he says don't you fear god
[1:06:50] he says if there's a prophet or somebody
[1:06:52] else visit him in dreams or visions or
[1:06:55] whatever but ain't nobody like moses
[1:06:58] i speak to him lift the ear
[1:07:01] when he hears me hears your audible
[1:07:03] voice
[1:07:04] and i know still i speak to him to lift
[1:07:07] the ear and they were stricken with
[1:07:09] leprosy
[1:07:11] you're both gonna die
[1:07:14] but god says don't touch
[1:07:16] my prophets no harm
[1:07:18] amen you can't do anything of god's
[1:07:20] anointed but what you receive of reward
[1:07:22] for amen
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:25] praise the lord
[1:07:27] and even and i've got a lot of
[1:07:28] confidence listen so so what good did it
[1:07:31] do nothing it'll never do any good until
[1:07:34] every person that professes to be a
[1:07:37] christian will forget his own ability
[1:07:40] and yield himself completely to god
[1:07:44] how many knows if you would be any kind
[1:07:46] of a christian if god does something you
[1:07:48] would believe what god does
[1:07:51] if you're completely yielded to god
[1:07:54] oh my
[1:07:56] i have to agree with brother brian
[1:07:57] there's a lot of things that we don't
[1:07:59] understand
[1:08:01] huh
[1:08:02] there's things we don't understand
[1:08:04] and they don't have to understand it
[1:08:07] god don't always ask you to understand
[1:08:09] everything
[1:08:10] because when he talked to i was
[1:08:12] preaching to the congregation there and
[1:08:14] he says unless you eat my flesh and
[1:08:16] drink my blood you have no life in you
[1:08:18] and didn't explain it
[1:08:20] and all of that who can hear this saying
[1:08:22] we don't understand it they all walked
[1:08:24] away because they couldn't understand it
[1:08:26] but look at who was saying it
[1:08:30] even said jesus to his own disciples
[1:08:32] will you go away also and they had a
[1:08:34] little revelation we know that the heart
[1:08:36] of god we know that to the messiah to
[1:08:38] whom shall we go there ain't nowhere
[1:08:41] else to go
[1:08:43] praise be to god amen
[1:08:46] and so i believe yields himself to god
[1:08:49] then god can achieve his purpose
[1:08:52] by sending not a revival
[1:08:59] but what he needs
[1:09:01] to send is a good killing
[1:09:05] good killing
[1:09:07] how many knows that the
[1:09:09] secret to getting closer to god is to
[1:09:12] die more to yourself
[1:09:15] if you want more of god you've got to
[1:09:17] make more room for him
[1:09:21] i believe that's what we've been doing
[1:09:22] the last few weeks don't you
[1:09:27] he says don't send a revive just yet but
[1:09:29] send a killing as the prophet said we
[1:09:32] need a day of mourning
[1:09:39] we need a day when we recognize we're
[1:09:42] not what we ought to be
[1:09:44] we need a day where
[1:09:46] we mourn because we're not what we ought
[1:09:48] to be
[1:09:50] i like this this retards the end of
[1:09:52] brother man of ministry
[1:09:53] he says and you have to die before you
[1:09:55] can be born again he needs
[1:09:57] we need a killing of ourselves this
[1:10:00] tabernacle needs a killing and me with
[1:10:04] it
[1:10:07] think about it
[1:10:09] the prophet of god had an angel wherever
[1:10:11] he was whatever he did but he said even
[1:10:13] he needed a killing of himself
[1:10:16] we need a killing so that we can be
[1:10:20] revived
[1:10:22] i mean he believes if you want revival
[1:10:24] first you have to come and buy yourself
[1:10:26] a little bit
[1:10:28] we need a killing of ourselves so that
[1:10:29] we can be revived to new life
[1:10:34] i think we're all in that place we
[1:10:36] wonder where i've prayed well i've
[1:10:38] sought god i read my bible but i just
[1:10:39] don't know why i don't have that fire
[1:10:41] like i once had huh how many knows we
[1:10:45] come to those planes we come to those
[1:10:47] deserts
[1:10:49] sure we do we come to those mountain
[1:10:51] tops
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:57] oh my so that we can be removed revive
[1:11:00] to new life and new hope
[1:11:03] a new hold a new experience
[1:11:07] and i want to put it this way also an
[1:11:09] appreciation for god
[1:11:13] a new vision it refocuses you it gives
[1:11:16] you a greater hope
[1:11:18] because as we go along a lot of times in
[1:11:20] our lives our christian life our hope of
[1:11:22] what's over there what the future is for
[1:11:24] us a lot of time that begins to dim
[1:11:29] it's not as bright as it used to be
[1:11:36] amen it's like the spring dries up
[1:11:40] i believe a church i believe a group of
[1:11:42] people i believe every christian
[1:11:45] and i have so much of the holy ghost
[1:11:48] that you'll have a testimony of what god
[1:11:51] is doing in his life your life
[1:11:54] let me just say this i hope somebody
[1:11:55] else comes to me and says boy god just
[1:11:57] showed me this
[1:11:58] god just showed me or god done something
[1:12:00] for me god healed me or god did whatever
[1:12:02] it might be
[1:12:04] because how many knows that when god
[1:12:05] wherever god is there's always the
[1:12:06] supernatural
[1:12:08] we need more of the supernatural
[1:12:10] happening in our lives
[1:12:12] and i guarantee it's not something you
[1:12:14] have to produce
[1:12:15] it's something that just happens as you
[1:12:17] get closer to god
[1:12:19] amen joy begins to build up amen yeah
[1:12:23] because i'll tell you i believe that i
[1:12:25] believe that there's joy unspeakable and
[1:12:27] full of glory
[1:12:29] what i want to this is where i want to
[1:12:31] focus on this direction i'm going to go
[1:12:32] here this morning and that is that new
[1:12:34] experience that new hope that new life
[1:12:38] that comes forth out of dying to
[1:12:40] ourselves
[1:12:41] out of rededicating ourselves to god
[1:12:44] again
[1:12:47] i would hope that god that brother
[1:12:49] branham if he was you know he would not
[1:12:51] come to this church
[1:12:53] and say boy it's as cold as it is
[1:12:55] outside on the inside
[1:12:57] it's not like an icicle ain't no amen
[1:12:59] there ain't no hallelujah he didn't have
[1:13:01] much for a dead church
[1:13:05] he'd have much for there's no only man's
[1:13:08] no hallelujah there's no rejoicing in
[1:13:10] god because we just by the time we just
[1:13:12] read where we ought to glorify god
[1:13:15] he dared to be praised for who he is and
[1:13:18] for his great testimonies in front of
[1:13:20] things that he did
[1:13:22] and for the things that he does
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:26] and i'll just tell you where i am this
[1:13:27] is where i am and this is what i'm
[1:13:29] preaching while i'm preaching
[1:13:31] because on me good
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:35] oh my you think you're a pretty good
[1:13:37] christian
[1:13:39] well that's good
[1:13:41] but maybe you have to dig just a little
[1:13:42] bit deeper
[1:13:47] take a little deeper see how much
[1:13:49] dedication you have
[1:13:51] amen
[1:13:54] i was
[1:13:57] sitting once again on my couch by god's
[1:13:59] grace we got the addition done to where
[1:14:00] we can sit on that by the couch there
[1:14:02] and look out the windows and put some
[1:14:04] birds some seed out there and watch all
[1:14:06] of those blue jays and cardinals and
[1:14:08] everything out there amen
[1:14:10] i told my wife honey i must be old i
[1:14:13] love bird watching
[1:14:20] i love just to watch birds you know
[1:14:23] and i was thinking there and i thought
[1:14:25] you know modern birds i thought you know
[1:14:28] god feeds those birds
[1:14:30] he talked about those birds how that you
[1:14:33] know he knows the fall of a sparrow and
[1:14:35] and so forth
[1:14:38] he said behold the fowls of the air how
[1:14:40] they so not neither do they reap nor
[1:14:42] gather into barns yet your heavenly
[1:14:45] father feedeth them and i thought well
[1:14:48] god didn't feed them i fed them
[1:14:55] and i thought just another second that
[1:14:57] says yes stupid to use you yes
[1:15:03] you hit it on your heart to feed him so
[1:15:05] don't don't give me that it's still god
[1:15:08] if you don't he'll do some other
[1:15:11] hello if you don't i guarantee ya
[1:15:14] there's going to be a big corn spill by
[1:15:16] the farmer somewhere
[1:15:19] whenever they're taking that wheat
[1:15:21] whenever they're taking that coin i
[1:15:22] guarantee god has his hand on it and
[1:15:25] he'll cause him to drop here and drop
[1:15:27] there because i don't know about you but
[1:15:29] when i drive by those cornfields they
[1:15:31] say flock of birds out there they're
[1:15:33] having them a good time
[1:15:35] what is it that heavenly father feeding
[1:15:38] them
[1:15:40] they don't have to worry they don't have
[1:15:42] those deep freeze like you and i do with
[1:15:44] a cow or a pig in there and man they
[1:15:46] just go out there and believe god
[1:15:49] and god takes care of him
[1:15:53] oh my
[1:15:55] and he talks about he takes care of the
[1:15:57] the grass and everything else
[1:16:00] he says and wherefore if god so clothed
[1:16:02] the grass of the field which today is
[1:16:04] and tomorrow is cast into the heaven
[1:16:06] shall not he much more clothe
[1:16:10] you
[1:16:12] oh ye of little faith
[1:16:17] and i thought that's right god you told
[1:16:19] us because you use the bird to get it
[1:16:21] through us that we actually have very
[1:16:23] little faith
[1:16:24] he said when i come back to earth will i
[1:16:26] even find faith on the earth
[1:16:31] i got to thinking of how that we really
[1:16:34] have a lot better than what we deserve
[1:16:38] you realize we all have it better than
[1:16:40] what we deserve
[1:16:42] if we follow in his footsteps remember
[1:16:44] jesus said we're going to be like him
[1:16:47] jesus didn't have a place to lay his
[1:16:48] head he didn't have a home
[1:16:50] he didn't have a bank account
[1:16:54] huh
[1:16:55] look at where he was look at what he
[1:16:57] preached
[1:16:58] he says he knows that you have neither
[1:17:00] of these things when they needed to pay
[1:17:01] their taxes or whatever and they didn't
[1:17:03] have it they had to go get some gold out
[1:17:05] of a fish's mouth
[1:17:08] oh we got if we don't have the
[1:17:10] bills paid and if we don't have two
[1:17:12] thousand three thousand five thousand i
[1:17:14] don't know maybe fifty thousand dollars
[1:17:16] like i don't know
[1:17:18] people go crazy over this stuff
[1:17:21] but we ought to be worried he says don't
[1:17:23] worry about those things these are the
[1:17:25] things that the gentiles work
[1:17:27] before this is what they worry about
[1:17:30] can we this is what our government
[1:17:32] worries about this is what they're
[1:17:33] trying to make it better for you
[1:17:35] huh
[1:17:37] giving you this and giving you that i
[1:17:38] know everybody wants a better life
[1:17:41] don't you realize the better we have at
[1:17:43] the time the further away we get from
[1:17:45] god
[1:17:47] even the prophet said we don't have it
[1:17:49] hard enough we've got it too nice we've
[1:17:51] got it too soft
[1:17:55] we're getting so soft until we can't
[1:17:57] even praise god we can't say hallelujah
[1:18:00] we can't say glory be to god
[1:18:05] think about it
[1:18:07] god is somewhere on the back oh ye of
[1:18:09] little
[1:18:10] faith paul he didn't have a coat to
[1:18:13] hardly wear he had great faith
[1:18:16] snake bite him him and he just chunks it
[1:18:19] off and goes on and eats his hamburger
[1:18:22] huh
[1:18:24] yeah man fixing that being a ship and
[1:18:25] the ship is going down folks the captain
[1:18:28] says we're going down
[1:18:32] he don't worry about it because an angel
[1:18:33] says just tell them to just hang in
[1:18:35] there
[1:18:36] and if they listen to what you say none
[1:18:38] will perish he had an angel watching
[1:18:41] over them
[1:18:44] folks when you think about it this is
[1:18:46] where i'm at when you're walking with
[1:18:48] god and you begin to realize how awesome
[1:18:50] god really is
[1:18:54] how amazing he really is
[1:18:58] that's where we're at
[1:19:01] i hope everybody's surrendered to god
[1:19:05] huh
[1:19:06] or did you lose it between last sunday
[1:19:08] and this sunday
[1:19:10] huh
[1:19:12] well i was closer monday halfway tuesday
[1:19:15] i lost it again
[1:19:21] someone was smiling right because you
[1:19:23] know that's what the devil tries to do
[1:19:25] i guarantee you take a stand for god
[1:19:28] before the next service he'll try to
[1:19:29] have tripped you up
[1:19:33] you make a pledge you make a dedication
[1:19:36] it won't be long he'll try to snatch
[1:19:38] that away from you
[1:19:39] try to get you further away right away
[1:19:41] if you possibly can
[1:19:43] let me tell you something i believe it's
[1:19:45] by the holy spirit that most of the time
[1:19:47] it's because we have so much
[1:19:50] we are so busy that we don't have time
[1:19:52] for god
[1:19:55] amen
[1:19:58] lord help us
[1:20:00] i don't care i don't know about you but
[1:20:02] i don't want to have to have it rough to
[1:20:04] praise god
[1:20:06] i don't want to have to have a trial
[1:20:07] that brings me to my knees to praise god
[1:20:11] been there done that that's enough of
[1:20:13] that let's praise god in the good times
[1:20:15] the bad times amen and thank you for
[1:20:17] everything that you have
[1:20:18] jesus didn't have what you have i didn't
[1:20:21] have what you have look at all the
[1:20:22] things that you got
[1:20:25] look at how good we have it
[1:20:27] and you have it that nice because of the
[1:20:29] grace of almighty god
[1:20:39] praise be to god

[1:21:19] sets you in heavenly places in christ
[1:21:21] jesus

[1:21:27] but like my time says when you're going
[1:21:28] down the road my goodness but every one
[1:21:31] of these days he's going to jump out of
[1:21:32] his truck and just do him a little jig
[1:21:34] and they're going to say tommy doesn't
[1:21:35] go crazy
[1:21:42] that's right but you just can't contain
[1:21:44] it
[1:21:45] that's how it ought to be for us this
[1:21:47] morning we just can't hardly stand it
[1:21:49] god is so good
[1:21:53] because he is
[1:21:59] his love

[1:22:04] his grace
[1:22:06] is amazing
[1:22:10] oh my don't get me started

[1:22:20] and god's providence
[1:22:24] god's love grace and provenance
[1:22:27] ma
[1:22:31] and this is one of the favorite
[1:22:32] scriptures that i always use
[1:22:34] when it comes to god's problems
[1:22:36] right
[1:22:38] he says don't worry
[1:22:40] he says shall he not much more
[1:22:43] clothe you
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:48] praise be to god
[1:22:50] you don't have to do like paul hey

[1:22:54] bring my coat down here would ya
[1:22:56] my goodness if i want a coat or two
[1:22:59] i got to decide which one i want out of
[1:23:01] the 10 in my closet
[1:23:04] right
[1:23:05] all the clothes
[1:23:07] he cares about whether you're clothes he
[1:23:09] cares about whether you're fed
[1:23:12] but that's not your concern that's not
[1:23:14] something you worry about
[1:23:16] just be like you're lying worried about
[1:23:18] it amen
[1:23:21] i'm worried about
[1:23:23] his righteousness
[1:23:25] being right with him
[1:23:27] isn't that right
[1:23:29] seek first the kingdom of god and his
[1:23:31] righteousness and all these things shall
[1:23:33] be added unto you therefore take no
[1:23:36] thought for tomorrow
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:39] amen jesus said quit thinking about
[1:23:41] these things so much
[1:23:43] because i guarantee it just like by the
[1:23:45] time you get to thinking about him
[1:23:47] something happens
[1:23:50] gee all you gotta do is meditate on him
[1:23:53] didn't the bible say meditate on him
[1:23:56] once in a while
[1:24:00] day and night
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:04] i'm still working on that
[1:24:06] how about you
[1:24:08] i'm giving more time and more thought to
[1:24:11] the lord
[1:24:13] and it's going to be good
[1:24:16] oh my god
[1:24:21] oh my
[1:24:23] because i believe like i want to just
[1:24:25] say i believe that
[1:24:27] the prophet god said what he said we
[1:24:30] ought to be the saddest
[1:24:34] we ought to be the happiest people
[1:24:38] on what the face of the earth
[1:24:46] shouldn't be any room for doom and gloom
[1:24:51] because he promised
[1:24:54] oh
[1:24:55] my i just had to think about motherboard
[1:24:57] i'm so glad i'm a christian i won't know
[1:25:00] what i would do if i wasn't a christian
[1:25:02] if i wasn't saved by the grace of god
[1:25:06] then i would be just like that sinner
[1:25:10] like brother brian said i wrote that
[1:25:11] down he says the only difference between
[1:25:13] trump and you them and you is god has
[1:25:15] shed his light on you
[1:25:21] oh my
[1:25:23] let's start first with god's love would
[1:25:25] that be okay
[1:25:27] how many knows that over saint john it
[1:25:29] talks about that god is love
[1:25:31] anybody that says they know him and you
[1:25:33] ain't got love in your heart
[1:25:36] now you're a liar
[1:25:38] he that loveth is of god he that loveth
[1:25:41] not is not the god
[1:25:45] it causes you to do stuff
[1:25:47] that you wouldn't have to do
[1:25:52] love
[1:25:52] does that's right he goes out there and
[1:25:55] produces grace
[1:25:58] amen
[1:25:59] it produces grace love produces greats
[1:26:03] oh my
[1:26:12] god didn't have to
[1:26:15] god didn't have to
[1:26:17] but he did
[1:26:20] but he did
[1:26:23] he didn't have to make me
[1:26:26] but he did
[1:26:29] in the conception
[1:26:31] of your mother's womb he could have
[1:26:32] chose a million other people besides you
[1:26:37] i'll just stay seated if you possibly
[1:26:39] can
[1:26:41] think about it but he chose you
[1:26:46] he chose you to live
[1:26:51] thank god
[1:26:57] i chose you out of all those people
[1:27:01] amen
[1:27:02] first of all let me just go all the way
[1:27:04] back
[1:27:05] to genesis the bible says and god
[1:27:08] created the heavens and the earth
[1:27:11] huh
[1:27:12] he'd have to
[1:27:15] but he did
[1:27:16] he made the mood he made the stars
[1:27:18] didn't have to but he did
[1:27:20] [Applause]
[1:27:21] he made the oceans he made the waters he
[1:27:23] made the animals he made everything that
[1:27:25] was made to marvel says
[1:27:29] without him there was nothing made that
[1:27:31] was made
[1:27:32] absolutely nothing
[1:27:34] he dwelt alone he was by himself and he
[1:27:37] was sufficient that way
[1:27:40] he was happy that way
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:44] can i say for a hundred quadrillion
[1:27:48] billion years
[1:27:50] he was by himself
[1:27:54] now
[1:27:56] that
[1:27:57] numerology brother brad is probably all
[1:27:59] messed up
[1:28:01] huh
[1:28:04] quadrillion
[1:28:05] billion trillions higher than billions
[1:28:07] so it would be quite trillions of years
[1:28:12] he was there by itself that's right
[1:28:14] don't go there your mind can't handle
[1:28:17] trying to figure out
[1:28:18] way back there
[1:28:20] no it don't work
[1:28:22] but he was
[1:28:24] and i accept that don't
[1:28:26] you but he had something in his mind
[1:28:30] he made all the animals he meant
[1:28:31] everything that was made
[1:28:33] because of what
[1:28:36] because of love in his heart
[1:28:39] because of the love that he had in his
[1:28:41] heart
[1:28:43] that's why i did it
[1:28:45] that's why we're here
[1:28:47] that's why everything is like it is
[1:28:48] because of the love of jesus christ
[1:28:50] that's why you sit there this morning
[1:28:54] huh you're not out there at home
[1:28:56] somewhere
[1:28:57] having went to a saturday night party

[1:29:20] earth all the animals
[1:29:24] and it was good
[1:29:26] how many can say it was good
[1:29:27] [Applause]

[1:35:59] amen chapter 50 last verse all these
[1:36:02] other ways he says let everything that
[1:36:03] has breath praise the lord
[1:36:07] all his creation praises him but god
[1:36:10] wasn't satisfied with just the animals
[1:36:12] and the lions and all of these beautiful
[1:36:15] things god could have had all this
[1:36:17] paradise and him and his angels couldn't
[1:36:19] come and it happened at the earth
[1:36:21] and enjoyed it
[1:36:24] but what was it
[1:36:26] he had something else in mind didn't he
[1:36:29] the bible says that he created man
[1:36:32] out of dust of the earth
[1:36:34] he had something else in mind
[1:36:37] that was adam and eve
[1:36:39] he created them
[1:36:42] male and female
[1:36:44] amen like we say sorry folks it was not
[1:36:47] adam and steve
[1:36:49] no
[1:36:50] it was not male and male it was male and
[1:36:52] female
[1:36:55] you know where we're at this morning
[1:36:57] we're at the place
[1:36:58] that they were way back in genesis
[1:37:05] i have never heard hardly at all
[1:37:08] of god ever repenting of anything
[1:37:12] repenting of something god repenting
[1:37:17] but it says in genesis
[1:37:19] 6 and
[1:37:21] 5 god saw the wickedness of man
[1:37:24] i mean it was after the fall
[1:37:26] i mean as he wouldn't have he wouldn't
[1:37:29] had to allow it to fall but he did
[1:37:32] huh sure he did
[1:37:35] why
[1:37:36] so that he could
[1:37:39] do
[1:37:40] something even greater
[1:37:42] than allowing it to fall
[1:37:44] how many is glad for the other side of
[1:37:46] the story
[1:37:47] i'm glad for the other side of the story
[1:37:49] because you know if falling was bad
[1:37:52] well it had to be a purpose so that he
[1:37:53] could pick you up again
[1:37:56] he had to let you fall in a hole
[1:37:59] i told my wife on the way to the church
[1:38:01] here and i was thinking about it i said
[1:38:02] write this down you know god allowed us
[1:38:04] to get into a hole that's what the world
[1:38:07] certainly is
[1:38:08] it's like a man that has fallen into the
[1:38:10] hole and he can't get back out
[1:38:14] he allowed adam and eve to fall into a
[1:38:16] hole and it was they were never
[1:38:18] satisfied
[1:38:19] man was never satisfied
[1:38:22] how many knows they were never satisfied
[1:38:24] until the day of pentecost
[1:38:27] even peter in them wasn't satisfied with
[1:38:29] jesus right there with him
[1:38:31] right
[1:38:32] now jesus denied him and curse and
[1:38:35] everything he wasn't satisfied he wasn't
[1:38:37] happy
[1:38:38] yet
[1:38:39] he still hadn't gotten what he needed to
[1:38:41] get
[1:38:42] not until the holy ghost came back
[1:38:45] is this is what restored man and picked
[1:38:47] him back up out of there out of the deep
[1:38:49] miry clay
[1:38:50] amen
[1:38:53] let me finish this here
[1:38:55] the wickedness of man was so great that
[1:38:57] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[1:38:59] heart was only evil continually
[1:39:03] and it repented the lord that he had
[1:39:05] made man on the earth and he grieved him
[1:39:08] at his heart
[1:39:10] i believe that's a message that it goes
[1:39:12] out amen to all of the world this
[1:39:15] morning and that is that god is once
[1:39:18] again griefed at his heart
[1:39:26] sure
[1:39:27] jesus was so grieved
[1:39:30] by israel rejecting him remember that he
[1:39:32] was on up on the mountain and he wept
[1:39:35] and he said how i would have hovered you
[1:39:38] as another brood but you would not
[1:39:42] it hurt him to his car that they
[1:39:44] rejected him
[1:39:45] they didn't want him
[1:39:48] isn't that what the world is today they
[1:39:50] don't want to glorify god they don't
[1:39:51] want to
[1:39:53] teach creation in church or in schools
[1:39:57] they want to teach evolution
[1:40:00] amen
[1:40:01] but a grieved god man had gotten into
[1:40:04] such a condition that it grieved god
[1:40:07] that he had even made man
[1:40:10] let me just read it
[1:40:14] and he says i will and he grieved him at
[1:40:16] his heart and the lord said i will
[1:40:17] destroy man whom i have created from the
[1:40:19] face of the earth both man and beast and
[1:40:21] creeping thing and the fowls of the air
[1:40:24] and for it repent of me that i have made
[1:40:29] them
[1:40:33] and what did he do
[1:40:37] he said i will destroy man
[1:40:39] from off the face of the earth
[1:40:42] so what would it have been like brothers
[1:40:43] and sisters if god would have just
[1:40:45] destroyed everybody he could have made
[1:40:47] another adam and eve right
[1:40:49] he could have what if he just said
[1:40:51] that's enough of that bunch of this
[1:40:54] that bunch of wickedness
[1:41:00] that bunch of idolatry
[1:41:04] just take it all off wipe it off
[1:41:06] but there was love in his heart
[1:41:09] right
[1:41:11] and he spared a righteous man named noah
[1:41:14] and his family and out of eight people
[1:41:17] out of the whole world
[1:41:18] amen eight people think about
[1:41:21] the restart of humanity
[1:41:24] because of the love of god
[1:41:29] because he's seen down through
[1:41:31] exactly what it would be and he would
[1:41:32] have children god desired
[1:41:35] sons and daughters
[1:41:37] because it's hard to fellowship with a
[1:41:39] cow
[1:41:41] or a horse
[1:41:43] huh or even a servant
[1:41:46] how many knows you need to be a little
[1:41:47] closer to him than a servant
[1:41:50] the bible says he's not ashamed to call
[1:41:52] them
[1:41:53] brethren
[1:41:55] amen
[1:41:57] closer than just a servant
[1:41:59] god had children
[1:42:01] sons and daughters like himself that he
[1:42:03] wanted to fellowship with
[1:42:06] amen and we're fellowshipping him with
[1:42:07] him now how he believes that
[1:42:09] but what will that fellowship be
[1:42:12] brother joe did you ever ask yourself
[1:42:14] when i meet the lord what's my reaction
[1:42:16] going to be
[1:42:18] how are you going to act when you see
[1:42:20] the lord
[1:42:23] ah think about it
[1:42:26] he looks you in the eye
[1:42:30] huh
[1:42:31] no doubt but we'll fall down prostrate
[1:42:33] at his feet
[1:42:34] and we'll say thank you lord jesus
[1:42:37] thank you jesus for what you've done for
[1:42:39] me
[1:42:41] we will thank and praise him because of
[1:42:43] the relationship that we had and what he
[1:42:45] delivered us from where he brought us
[1:42:48] out of
[1:42:49] how did he pick this up out of the hole
[1:42:51] right out of the deep miry
[1:42:55] and he had such love for us
[1:42:58] god who is rich in mercy right
[1:43:01] we were sinners in the world but god
[1:43:04] rich in mercy where with the love that
[1:43:07] he had for us brought us out
[1:43:09] pulled us out of there
[1:43:13] folks i don't know about you
[1:43:15] but i see grace i see the love of god
[1:43:18] working in this congregation
[1:43:22] i see him calling us calling us further
[1:43:24] and further away from the things of the
[1:43:26] world
[1:43:28] to a closer walk i hear god speaking
[1:43:32] myself that got nothing to do with it
[1:43:34] it's his spirit
[1:43:37] that is pulling on us that's drawing on
[1:43:39] us
[1:43:40] that wants to be closer to us so that
[1:43:43] when we do see him face to face we don't
[1:43:45] have to be ashamed
[1:43:51] we don't have to repent
[1:43:53] we don't did
[1:43:55] we had everything right with him
[1:43:57] we were there we had our clothes in line
[1:43:59] we had spotless we were there waiting
[1:44:02] for him like peter said
[1:44:04] that you'll be found him not having any
[1:44:06] blemish spot no wrinkle no nothing
[1:44:10] but say lord is so good to see you
[1:44:14] you finally come
[1:44:16] he'll say it's good to see you
[1:44:18] come and enjoy
[1:44:21] the things that's been created for you
[1:44:22] from the foundation of the world
[1:44:24] well done good and faithful servant
[1:44:27] enter into the joy
[1:44:30] of the lord
[1:44:34] there's lots of room for you to worship
[1:44:36] praise up here
[1:44:37] you praise me down there now come up
[1:44:39] here and praise me
[1:44:41] amen
[1:44:43] live for the eons of time
[1:44:46] amen aren't you glad
[1:44:49] listen folks that let me just talk on
[1:44:52] end with talking about providence for a
[1:44:54] few minutes
[1:44:57] god is provided
[1:44:59] i mean i'm just glad for god's provided
[1:45:01] way
[1:45:02] god has provided a way for us in this
[1:45:04] generation if it would have been for his
[1:45:06] love that he had for us he'd have never
[1:45:08] wrote in there about malachi 4. he'd
[1:45:10] never said i'll send you a light to the
[1:45:11] prophet before the great and dreadful
[1:45:12] day of the lord he never said i'll
[1:45:14] return your hearts back to the faith of
[1:45:16] the fathers you're going to believe like
[1:45:17] paul that people did hello you're going
[1:45:20] to be restored back to the faith of the
[1:45:22] fathers and man because if he wouldn't
[1:45:24] have done that we'd all be laid out of
[1:45:25] citizens we'd all be sitting here with
[1:45:27] tattoos all over us we'd be sitting here
[1:45:29] with nose rings in the earrings
[1:45:32] and ain't no telling what we'd look like
[1:45:34] well we wouldn't even be here would we
[1:45:38] no we'd be out there with the rest and
[1:45:39] we'd forget about going to church but
[1:45:40] we'd be in that kind of condition if it
[1:45:42] wasn't for god's love and his grace for
[1:45:45] you or not
[1:45:47] god makes the way i don't care what the
[1:45:49] situation is he makes a way he cares
[1:45:52] about us he provides for us his love and
[1:45:55] his grace provides for us
[1:45:59] right down to the clothing that you wear
[1:46:02] paul never worried about what he what he
[1:46:04] needed he never worried about his next
[1:46:06] meal
[1:46:07] he never thought about any of that he
[1:46:09] just thought about letting god use him
[1:46:15] to bring the gospel to the gentiles to
[1:46:17] establish churches here and there and
[1:46:19] work for the lord i mean that's our top
[1:46:22] that is our primary
[1:46:25] let's let god work through our lives and
[1:46:28] we do our job then we provide for this
[1:46:31] and then we do all of that right but our
[1:46:33] primary thing is to seek the kingdom
[1:46:35] first
[1:46:36] because his grace and his love will
[1:46:38] provide for everything you need
[1:46:42] an example is israel how many knows when
[1:46:45] israel needed a deliverer god sent them
[1:46:48] moses
[1:46:50] and when he got out of out of egypt and
[1:46:52] so forth god wanted to get it in their
[1:46:54] minds that i will supply for you
[1:46:58] i will make a way for you
[1:47:01] that's why we sing i will make a boy
[1:47:03] when there just seems to be no way
[1:47:10] a lot of you are sitting here this
[1:47:12] morning because
[1:47:13] this is the way that god provided for
[1:47:16] you
[1:47:16] you're sitting in god's provided way
[1:47:20] huh
[1:47:22] that's exactly right
[1:47:24] i know i am
[1:47:26] i am here because god provided a way for
[1:47:28] me
[1:47:29] when i didn't know which direction to go
[1:47:30] what to do god led me through
[1:47:33] he leads you
[1:47:34] through
[1:47:36] you got to put a smile on your face to
[1:47:38] know that no matter what the future
[1:47:40] holds
[1:47:41] it doesn't matter what the government i
[1:47:42] don't care to squeeze i don't care what
[1:47:44] is ahead of us
[1:47:46] we know the one that is leading us
[1:47:48] we know the one that makes a way for us
[1:47:51] because it's his grace
[1:47:55] and to think that you didn't have to
[1:47:57] he didn't have to earn your salvation
[1:48:00] you didn't have to work for it oh yeah
[1:48:02] he's accept what he did
[1:48:05] oh my when we think about it it's what
[1:48:07] god did it's all about what god does
[1:48:10] but god did it calvary and now we
[1:48:12] respond to that
[1:48:14] it's a reaction to an action why will
[1:48:16] respond to what he already did he
[1:48:19] created all of these things for his
[1:48:20] children amen the bible says god has
[1:48:23] made all things
[1:48:24] amen i believe brother brian are talking
[1:48:26] about to have fun with
[1:48:28] he created all things for us to enjoy
[1:48:33] that's what the bible says he uses the
[1:48:34] name enjoy
[1:48:36] bible god once says here we are saved by
[1:48:38] grace being led by almighty god going
[1:48:41] down this route take go to ours happy go
[1:48:43] entire seven just as happy as we can be
[1:48:47] with not a care in the world
[1:48:49] only
[1:48:50] that we please him
[1:48:52] that is our main caries lord am i
[1:48:54] pleasing to you
[1:48:56] amen
[1:48:57] i thank god
[1:48:59] and i begin i i you know i want to go
[1:49:01] through a lot of it but i don't have
[1:49:03] time
[1:49:04] but just to think about just israel look
[1:49:07] when the first thing he did was
[1:49:10] bring him down to the red sea
[1:49:12] right a dead end
[1:49:15] no way to go with chariots and horses of
[1:49:18] the whole army coming up and hearing it
[1:49:21] come
[1:49:22] because he wanted to see what they would
[1:49:23] do
[1:49:24] he wanted to see if they would
[1:49:26] completely
[1:49:27] trust him
[1:49:30] completely submit themselves to him and
[1:49:32] say well god brought us up he'll make a
[1:49:34] way
[1:49:35] if they all sat down better than if
[1:49:37] they'd all sat down on the rock and says
[1:49:38] well we've got to worry in the world
[1:49:40] folks
[1:49:42] praise be to god
[1:49:43] can i tell you something i believe those
[1:49:45] two million people that are in hell
[1:49:47] today or lost
[1:49:49] would have been in heaven
[1:49:51] because the bible says that they believe
[1:49:53] not and that's why god refused to let
[1:49:55] them enter into rest jesus said they're
[1:49:58] everyone dead because no matter how many
[1:50:00] times i put them in a hard place no
[1:50:01] matter how many times i kept them from
[1:50:04] allowing them to get hungry i allowed
[1:50:06] them to get thirsty because i want them
[1:50:07] to realize something that i am god and i
[1:50:11] do to supply i make way
[1:50:15] how many believes that god makes the way
[1:50:18] i want to say this again i said it a
[1:50:20] million times don't take things into
[1:50:22] your own hands and do and deal with
