[16:20] amen we'll just share a little bit
[16:21] before we get into word perhaps
[16:30] it's power heads precious
[16:33] lord and savior we come before you once
[16:35] again thankful
[16:37] to be able to assemble ourselves
[16:38] together in your name knowing god that
[16:40] you're in our midst lord jesus
[16:42] we're so grateful for that father for
[16:44] the fulfilling of that
[16:46] promise that you made and lord we just
[16:49] ask god that you just
[16:51] be with each one that has come speak to
[16:53] every heart
[16:54] you know each one and just what they
[16:55] have need of
[16:57] and you know how to speak just to that
[16:59] heart lord
[17:00] we ask god that you just have your way
[17:02] in every portion of the service tonight
[17:04] bless the reading of the word the
[17:05] meditation of our heart that which we
[17:07] feel you've laid upon our heart to speak
[17:09] we just ask your blessing and father we
[17:11] just thank you father for your many
[17:13] blessings for your goodness to us lord
[17:16] we love you lord we just ask god that
[17:18] you'll be with us
[17:19] in us and through us now in jesus name
[17:22] amen
[17:23] ten bibles if you will
[17:26] to the book of hebrews
[17:31] two hebrews two
[17:38] just a little thought i feel like the
[17:40] lord laid on my heart
[17:43] to speak on it's kind of different i
[17:45] guess
[17:46] i don't know that i've speak spoke on
[17:48] this before so this will be
[17:50] a little different hebrews 2
[17:55] verse 1 through
[17:58] 4. therefore
[18:02] we ought to give the more earnest he to
[18:04] the things which we have heard
[18:06] at least at any time we should let them
[18:09] slip
[18:10] for if the word spoken by angels was
[18:12] steadfast and every transgression and
[18:14] disobedience
[18:16] received a just recompense of reward
[18:20] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[18:22] great salvation which at the first
[18:24] began to be spoken by the lord and was
[18:27] confirmed
[18:28] unto us by them that heard him god also
[18:31] bearing them witness both with signs and
[18:35] wonders and with diverse miracles
[18:37] and gifts of the holy ghost according to
[18:39] his own
[18:40] will may god at his blessings to reading
[18:42] and words you can be seated
[18:46] amen so we had
[18:50] a uh my aunt katie she passed away
[18:54] i think last uh this
[18:57] winter and so they had an auction for
[19:00] all her belongings
[19:01] amen and so the man
[19:05] that actually did the auction
[19:10] his name is jos
[19:14] or yoast says he
[19:17] called him an amish he'd be my uncle or
[19:20] my
[19:21] i guess it'd be my half uncle because we
[19:24] had my family had
[19:26] i think thinking it's 16 i think there
[19:29] was eight with the one
[19:30] my grandpa had eight children with the
[19:32] one wife she passed away and then he had
[19:34] another eight by
[19:36] another wife so we have 16 aunts and
[19:39] uncles
[19:40] and of course you know they have big
[19:41] families
[19:43] and so they have children and they have
[19:45] children so that's how far down the line
[19:46] we are
[19:47] so they uh it was kind of funny we were
[19:50] there looking at the belongings
[19:53] that they all laid out and they had a
[19:55] bible laying there
[19:57] in a case like and i opened the bible
[19:59] and the bible was
[20:01] i guess looked pretty new or looked new
[20:04] and i
[20:04] didn't know it was a german and english
[20:06] bible and then there was a
[20:08] byler bible when they called the bible
[20:09] bible and it was like that thick you
[20:12] know
[20:13] and so and i was just looking at some of
[20:16] my
[20:17] cousins and different ones and i says
[20:19] look
[20:20] look this they said something about you
[20:22] ought to have that one i said right
[20:24] there
[20:24] i said well i think this one over here
[20:26] is worth a lot more
[20:30] and i don't know what the bible bible
[20:32] went for it wasn't about three four
[20:33] hundred dollars probably but
[20:35] uh they went into a bidding war with the
[20:37] word of god
[20:38] and uh that bible other bible brought
[20:40] like twenty two hundred dollars
[20:43] just for that bible you know and i like
[20:45] that one so i went about 200 275
[20:48] and they cut me off at about 300 i said
[20:50] that's it for me you know
[20:56] but anyway so today was truly worth a
[20:58] lot more
[20:59] and i couldn't help it after
[21:02] that you know one of my cousins was
[21:05] buying it and you know they go back and
[21:07] forth and squirm and like
[21:09] you know they just went in the bible but
[21:11] they outbid
[21:12] each other and everything at the end of
[21:13] it all when they said sold i went well
[21:15] hallelujah
[21:19] and my god laughs because you know but
[21:20] praise god it's the most valuable thing
[21:23] here you know
[21:24] oh my that was pretty good it probably
[21:26] went for more than anything else there
[21:27] but
[21:28] i thought that was good but anyway so
[21:32] but it was amazing you know to see
[21:35] like i said yours joey's my my half
[21:39] uncle and uh
[21:43] he pay he he was pretty wise about it
[21:45] and we we told him that but
[21:48] the amish schwarzenegger where i come
[21:49] from they can't go to our
[21:51] family reunion you know they can't go to
[21:53] something like that so
[21:55] he wanted to kind of have a family
[21:57] reunion slash auction so he just said
[21:59] we're having an auction
[22:00] for all the cousins you know all the
[22:02] cousins and so forth
[22:04] so he made it specific for that and it
[22:06] brought almost everybody there that was
[22:08] physically able to be there so
[22:10] i got to see even my my i think my
[22:12] sister anna and
[22:13] and david had moved out to uh missouri
[22:17] and we were trying to figure out last
[22:19] time we've seen each other
[22:21] and i guess it was like 16 years
[22:24] 16 years since we've seen each other in
[22:26] the same way with anna and jacob
[22:29] and uh the way we knew it is i had a
[22:32] picture of my mom's grave in my dad's
[22:35] grave
[22:36] and so he was kind of wondering how long
[22:38] it was and we knew it was at my dad's
[22:40] funeral so anyway we went back and i
[22:42] looked at the pictures and it was
[22:44] 16 years ago it meant not my dad but my
[22:47] mom because she was the last one to pass
[22:49] away so yeah it was my mom's funeral
[22:51] 16 years and you know after that long
[22:55] time especially if you're talking around
[22:58] from 45
[23:00] to 60 you know people are going to
[23:02] change in that time frame and you gotta
[23:05] squirm and look and twice you know
[23:08] because it's amazing how you know
[23:10] just seeing one person one way you
[23:11] remember them that way and the next time
[23:12] you see them you don't really hardly
[23:14] recognize them
[23:15] because you know you're just a lot older
[23:18] and so it was pretty crazy because jacob
[23:20] i should have known pretty good but
[23:22] there was a group of schwarzenegger
[23:24] amish boy when you get in the group's
[23:25] fortune trouba
[23:26] army system mary jane you know how it is
[23:28] a little bit funny feeling and stuff
[23:30] but anyway uh so i was right there in
[23:34] the midst and i said
[23:36] i know you i said i would mean i'm not
[23:38] shy i said ah
[23:40] jacob that's who you are and he kind of
[23:41] laughed you know
[23:43] and jacob picked him out you know but he
[23:45] was really he really had aged
[23:48] but anyway so and my brother david
[23:52] um he was actually i actually baptized
[23:56] david mose and emmanuel in the pond up
[23:59] there one time and
[24:00] moania and moses both got the baptism
[24:02] the holy ghost but david didn't get it
[24:05] and so he turned back he went back amish
[24:08] he was pretty staunch he's a staunch
[24:10] amishman
[24:11] but i got up to him in the crowd of
[24:13] amishment
[24:15] hey dave you know i haven't seen you for
[24:17] a long time
[24:18] and i went up there and i gave him a hug
[24:20] you know he wasn't really abrasive but i
[24:22] jugged him up there anyway i said you
[24:25] better hug me i'm bigger you know not
[24:27] really but
[24:28] anyway we gave him a hug whether he
[24:30] liked it or not you know and so but he
[24:32] like loosened up and they were pretty
[24:34] good
[24:35] but so it was just good to see my family
[24:37] and so
[24:39] but david he has two children that have
[24:42] left the amish
[24:43] i didn't even know it but they were
[24:46] there also
[24:47] and so i got to meet them and
[24:50] they're coming you know one of them
[24:52] starting to go to baptist church and all
[24:53] but
[24:54] i really would love to sit down they
[24:56] want us to come and visit with and sit
[24:57] down and talk to the lord about them
[24:59] talk to them about the lord and the word
[25:01] of god so i have several that really
[25:03] that really want to do that and
[25:06] there's just a lot there's just actually
[25:08] a work to be done
[25:09] and so i certainly want to try to be a
[25:11] witness here and we plan on going again
[25:13] in a couple weeks
[25:15] but uh go back up there and and try to
[25:17] be a witness
[25:19] but anyway so that was it we had
[25:22] most all the cousins and the amish
[25:24] different ones they were all there and
[25:26] we had a pretty good time and this lady
[25:28] she had
[25:29] just a bunch of households she had
[25:31] scrapbooks she loved scrapbooks and she
[25:33] liked to make
[25:34] cards like uh cards like birthday cards
[25:37] all kinds of stamps and stuff she had
[25:39] and then just a bunch just
[25:41] a bunch of household stuff you know you
[25:42] thought you might get twenty five
[25:43] thousand dollar fourth but
[25:45] it ended up all going for about ninety
[25:46] five thousand dollars
[25:48] i don't know how but it did but anyway
[25:51] so but it was just good to see everybody
[25:53] again it was very different
[25:54] and i do realize that having been away
[25:57] from the amish and so forth i've missed
[25:59] out
[26:00] on getting to really know and and be
[26:03] close to a lot of my family
[26:05] amen so amen if nothing else i realized
[26:09] the importance
[26:11] realized the importance of trying to be
[26:13] a witness to them
[26:14] amen and you know i was thinking
[26:17] i was thinking about it if i'd had a
[26:21] chance to maybe have a talk with
[26:22] everybody or whatever if i would
[26:24] go up and talk to all these amish folks
[26:26] all these
[26:27] my brother and all of them i thought
[26:29] well what would you say
[26:31] you know i would ask him this question i
[26:33] said so
[26:36] i finally figured out i'd say this way i
[26:39] i finally figured out why
[26:41] that you guys are amish
[26:44] you know why you stay amish why you do
[26:47] the way that you do
[26:49] yeah imagine get their attention don't
[26:51] you
[26:54] and my answer would be this you're
[26:56] trying to make it to heaven
[27:00] you know right that's what they're
[27:01] trying to do they're trying to make it
[27:04] to heaven
[27:05] and they truly think that you got to be
[27:06] amish to make it you know
[27:09] and so and that's respect that's that's
[27:11] something that we have mutual grounds on
[27:14] is the fact that that's what they truly
[27:15] want to do and a lot of them
[27:17] i have family members that i realize
[27:19] they're not as happy as they used to be
[27:22] you know right they used to be a lot
[27:24] more cheerful but now they're getting up
[27:26] in their 60s and so forth getting older
[27:28] and
[27:28] as you get down towards the end of your
[27:30] life you realize that
[27:33] you know you can meet your maker one of
[27:34] these days amen and you get a little
[27:37] more serious about life
[27:38] and as you get more serious about life
[27:40] you realize that hey you either chose
[27:42] the right path or you didn't
[27:44] now right either
[27:48] you got it right or you didn't and it's
[27:49] the same way and i thought that's the
[27:50] same way with any church really
[27:52] everybody's trying to make it to heaven
[27:57] you know and if we all just realize that
[28:01] that it's not going to be your church
[28:03] that gets you there it's only there's
[28:04] only one way and that's through jesus
[28:06] christ
[28:07] because if you think it's just your
[28:08] church that's gone you're just bitterly
[28:10] wrong
[28:11] amen because there's only one way really
[28:14] and that is through jesus christ the
[28:15] lord
[28:16] i am the way the truth in life no man
[28:18] comes to the father but by me
[28:20] and so i believe that people would
[28:22] actually
[28:23] and if you'd have more respect for each
[28:25] other if you just looked at it that way
[28:27] and realized that that's truly what
[28:28] people's trying to do
[28:30] but they're just taking choosing their
[28:32] avenue choosing the path
[28:34] that they think is going to get them
[28:35] there because the fact is
[28:38] that that death is in front of them that
[28:40] right
[28:41] that last breath is in front of them the
[28:43] other world's in front of them and you
[28:44] better be serious about it
[28:46] amen and in choosing it so
[28:50] anyway we just hope that
[28:53] amen we can be a witness somehow to
[28:55] folks there i have
[28:56] of course david as you know they were
[28:58] here and so forth they have family
[28:59] members and
[29:00] then there says other families you just
[29:02] never know
[29:04] uh you know you know who you really can
[29:07] help
[29:09] but you just have to do what you can and
[29:11] see what the lord does because i know
[29:13] whenever i went to witness to my
[29:14] brothers and family
[29:15] i thought that this brother that sister
[29:17] would probably accept the lord and
[29:18] receive the word of god but
[29:20] it was just the other way around so you
[29:22] can't judge by your own self it takes
[29:23] god
[29:24] knocking on somebody's heart's door to
[29:26] do it
[29:28] amen and so anyway
[29:32] just keep praying for my family amen i
[29:35] have a real burden for them
[29:37] and i just uh
[29:40] anyway i just have a real burden for him
[29:42] amen that the lord will just
[29:46] uh you know if if people leave the amish
[29:48] if people come
[29:49] out where are they gonna go you know
[29:53] and so if they don't have the path to
[29:56] take
[29:57] how are they going to know what path to
[29:58] take really so
[30:00] anyway just pray for us all right
[30:04] so let's get back on the subject here
[30:07] let's talk tonight
[30:08] i want to talk about something tonight
[30:10] amen and i want to title a little bit
[30:12] something different if that's okay
[30:15] in brother bannon preaching a message on
[30:17] presuming
[30:18] he preached up a message on presuming he
[30:21] says you know
[30:22] i'm going to teach on the subject of
[30:23] presuming
[30:25] he says the webster says to presume is
[30:27] to venture
[30:28] without actual authority
[30:31] or to take it or to take for granted
[30:35] all right that's what the word presume
[30:37] means go without authority or
[30:39] just taking it for granted he says now
[30:42] that's where so many people does that
[30:45] just take it for granted amen that's
[30:48] right
[30:49] amen and now as we think about
[30:52] that word taking it for granted
[30:57] the actual interpretation is pretty a
[30:59] little different than what i
[31:01] expected it amen in the webster's it
[31:04] says that what does taking something for
[31:06] granted mean
[31:07] he says if you take something for
[31:09] granted
[31:11] he says you believe that it is true or
[31:13] accepted as normal
[31:16] without thinking about it
[31:20] without thinking about it i think
[31:23] everybody here sitting
[31:24] tonight if i would ask everybody just
[31:28] what that means i think
[31:29] most of us would agree that it's
[31:32] something that we would
[31:34] uh that we would we'd take something for
[31:36] granted
[31:37] it would be more or something perhaps
[31:39] that we neglect
[31:42] right something that we really don't
[31:45] take seriously
[31:47] we just take something for granted
[31:51] not seriously here it says that you
[31:54] don't
[31:54] really think about it but it baptized it
[31:58] in with presuming
[31:59] venturing without authority not being
[32:01] sure about
[32:02] not taking it real serious venturing
[32:05] into a place that you don't really have
[32:06] the authority go
[32:08] or don't really know about amen so
[32:11] tonight i want to just title this
[32:13] mike and grace will take a and and call
[32:16] this
[32:17] things we take for granted
[32:22] amen now in hebrews here if you'll
[32:26] notice
[32:28] that it says that we are to give the
[32:30] more earnest heed to the things
[32:33] which we have heard at least at any time
[32:37] we should let them slip
[32:41] i think that's something else that
[32:43] happens in our lives as
[32:45] we are married perhaps or or different
[32:48] things you know
[32:49] as we let our spouse or
[32:53] become more common to us isn't that
[32:56] right
[32:57] and we become negligent
[33:00] and we let it slip we let our
[33:02] relationship slip
[33:04] we can uh in our spiritual walk we let
[33:07] our prayer life
[33:09] slip and we just take for granted
[33:12] everything will be all right till we
[33:14] presume
[33:15] that everything will be okay now as i
[33:19] begin to think about this i really begin
[33:21] to think how
[33:22] we as human beings we as human beings
[33:25] have a very
[33:26] strong tendency to go backwards
[33:30] instead of forward so many times for
[33:33] every step
[33:34] forward that we take let's just do that
[33:37] for a second
[33:38] we take one step forward we take two
[33:41] steps back
[33:43] we take one step forward we take two
[33:46] steps back
[33:47] we take one step forward we take two
[33:50] steps back
[33:52] i'm already way back here again right we
[33:55] started over there
[33:57] and that's how we as human beings
[34:01] how that we tend to be and you know why
[34:06] the reason why is because of this flesh
[34:11] it's because of the first birth that we
[34:14] tend to be that way
[34:16] now we know that israel when they came
[34:18] out of egypt isn't that right
[34:20] the prophet of god said that the
[34:21] destination that they had to go
[34:23] to if i'm not wrong he says was about
[34:25] what two weeks
[34:28] about two weeks that it would take to
[34:30] get where they were going
[34:32] and it took what 40 years
[34:37] now that's some serious one step forward
[34:40] two step
[34:41] back that's worse than that isn't it
[34:46] every time israel amen whenever god
[34:48] would deliver him out of egypt you know
[34:50] they should have known that was the
[34:52] mighty hand of god hallelujah they
[34:54] praise god
[34:56] they worship god they give him glory
[34:59] but the first time they come up against
[35:01] the red sea they went
[35:03] 20 steps back now right
[35:07] why because they took it for granted
[35:09] that they could complain
[35:11] and that there would be nothing no no
[35:13] punishment with it in their
[35:16] eye the whole world is taking
[35:20] so much for granted
[35:24] they take it for granted we take things
[35:27] for granted
[35:29] amen now i've got
[35:32] different things would that be all right
[35:33] tonight we're going to talk about
[35:34] different things
[35:36] all the different things that we take
[35:37] for granted
[35:39] amen and it's a lot of things that we
[35:41] take for granted
[35:43] that we really don't think about
[35:47] amen and when you don't think about it
[35:49] when you take something for granted
[35:52] you don't what appreciate it like you
[35:54] should
[35:56] you neglect it and many times
[36:00] you lose it amen
[36:04] all right now there's so many things so
[36:07] many things that we take for granted
[36:09] but man as a whole is always seems like
[36:14] they always go backwards we're always
[36:16] going back and even hebrews there paul
[36:18] was telling them
[36:20] be careful now he says give earnesty
[36:24] to the things you've heard least you
[36:27] let them slip and it becomes common to
[36:30] you
[36:31] you know right when it becomes common to
[36:34] you
[36:35] a minute doesn't mean anything and then
[36:37] he says for if the word spoken by angels
[36:40] was set fast
[36:41] and every transcription transgression
[36:43] and disobedience
[36:44] received a just recompense of reward
[36:48] how shall we escape if we neglect
[36:52] amen or let slip or take
[36:55] for granted so great a salvation
[37:00] amen how shall we escape i mean there is
[37:03] a reward
[37:04] people even in that part
[37:07] about judgment down the road talk about
[37:09] judgment how there is
[37:10] always a reward for everything you do
[37:14] now right uh
[37:18] i'm just going to speak it as it comes
[37:20] to mind we take for granted
[37:23] and we don't really think about how that
[37:25] this whole life
[37:27] this life what we're here for
[37:30] is to get ready for the other life
[37:34] how many believes that you know we just
[37:37] take it for granted that we're here
[37:38] we're going to live and so forth but no
[37:40] it's more than that
[37:42] we don't we should think more seriously
[37:44] about it
[37:45] not take for granted and realize that
[37:47] we're absolutely realized we're
[37:50] absolutely preparing and getting ready
[37:53] for the other life for eternal life
[37:56] amen for what is coming this is a place
[37:59] of preparation that's what this place is
[38:02] a place of choosing a place of
[38:05] preparation
[38:06] a place of training and certainly a
[38:10] place
[38:10] that you don't want to be negligent
[38:14] ultimately those who are negligent
[38:18] and take for granted the word of god
[38:22] are going to come to a judgment they
[38:25] don't think there's going to be a judge
[38:26] they don't want to believe that there's
[38:27] a judgment
[38:28] they just take it for granted that they
[38:30] won't but there will be
[38:32] the same way with the hell same way with
[38:34] destruction
[38:36] but those who don't take it for granted
[38:40] what do we expect a resurrection and a
[38:42] new heavens
[38:44] and a new earth amen oh we don't want to
[38:47] be in the side that
[38:49] neglects and that takes things for
[38:51] granted
[38:53] takes things lightly
[38:58] amen and paul's saying telling them here
[39:02] you know we're not going to escape
[39:04] either if we neglect this salvation
[39:07] which first was spoken of by the lord
[39:09] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[39:11] heard him
[39:13] and notice god also bearing them witness
[39:16] both signs and wonders with diverse
[39:18] miracles
[39:19] gifts of the holy ghost according to his
[39:21] own will
[39:22] so when this gospel came forth i mean
[39:24] those it came with power
[39:26] and demonstration of the holy ghost
[39:30] miracles were done just like in this end
[39:32] time
[39:34] amen the miraculous was done
[39:38] amen praise be to god
[39:43] so you better take heed peter first
[39:45] peter he also said
[39:47] in chapter the second second peter verse
[39:51] chapter 1 verse 12 he says wherefore i
[39:55] will not be negligent
[39:57] to be put you always in remembrance of
[40:00] these things
[40:01] though ye know them and are established
[40:04] in the present truth
[40:11] that's why i don't you know
[40:14] i've heard preachers
[40:18] perhaps i won't say they made it a
[40:20] doctrine or anything but they thought
[40:21] perhaps someday we won't have to have
[40:23] preachers anymore because
[40:25] the preaching is for the perfecting of
[40:27] the saints once the saints come to
[40:28] perfection
[40:29] you won't need the preachers anymore huh
[40:33] i like that idea pretty good but bible
[40:36] also teaches me that we're very
[40:37] forgetful
[40:38] and we need remaining so i think we'll
[40:41] always need preachers because we always
[40:43] need reminding
[40:44] because we're forgetful people is that
[40:47] right
[40:48] that's right we need our pure mind
[40:51] stir up your pure minds by way of
[40:55] remembrance
[40:56] amen why so do we don't become negligent
[40:59] and so we don't take
[41:01] things for granted all right
[41:04] so now let's just begin here
[41:08] amen i have a
[41:11] statement here that i would like to make
[41:14] just want to make a statement i thought
[41:15] of this statement
[41:24] and then i also read a quote on it that
[41:27] i really liked real well but
[41:29] that is live
[41:34] like you are going to die by the end of
[41:36] the day
[41:38] always live like you are going to die by
[41:41] the end of the day
[41:48] in other words be doing what you would
[41:49] want to be doing
[41:52] if you died at the end of the day then i
[41:55] thought about what the pride of god said
[41:59] how that you're not really fit to live
[42:02] in that right until you are ready to die
[42:07] and he believes that amen
[42:11] and it puts things in perspective amen
[42:14] it'll help you live right
[42:16] amen you love the lord
[42:26] first of all we take for granted
[42:34] where we live amen
[42:38] most of the time we don't really
[42:41] appreciate living in america
[42:44] you don't think about it you don't think
[42:47] about the freedoms that you have
[42:51] and that right just the place that you
[42:53] live just in this country
[42:56] we take for granted that we're living in
[42:58] the greatest country
[42:59] probably anywhere sure it's wicked sure
[43:02] it's that
[43:04] but look at the immigration crisis that
[43:06] we have
[43:07] that right they all want to get here
[43:10] brother glenn
[43:11] they want to get in here huh
[43:16] and guess what i if i was out there
[43:20] i would probably want to swim that canal
[43:22] myself
[43:23] i'd probably climb that wall myself i
[43:26] probably wouldn't care if i was illegal
[43:28] or whatever
[43:30] from what i hear that doesn't let you in
[43:32] if you get in so all you really gotta do
[43:34] is get in
[43:35] i'd be getting in
[43:38] huh why because they tell you about the
[43:42] opportunity
[43:43] and that right the privilege that you
[43:45] have
[43:46] people take for granted we take for
[43:48] granted the privilege
[43:50] that we have in the financial world
[43:54] isn't that right everybody wants to get
[43:57] in here
[43:58] sure they do amen
[44:02] no this country is certainly you know on
[44:05] its downward path but it's still
[44:07] the greatest place to live we still have
[44:10] more freedoms than anybody else
[44:13] we still got guns we still
[44:16] can meet in church huh most places no no
[44:21] amen and it's getting to where you know
[44:23] canada if i heard
[44:25] i heard about from canada how that they
[44:27] were searching for this church that is
[44:29] underground and they're meeting them
[44:30] from place to place
[44:31] and they're trying to catch them well
[44:34] folks that's back in the dark ages again
[44:37] huh my personal opinion is
[44:42] if people want to get together not wear
[44:44] a face mask and dive
[44:46] of it go make my day hey that's your
[44:49] privilege
[44:52] huh that's freedom you should know
[44:55] whether you want to go there or not make
[44:57] up your own mind
[44:58] but for them to dictate to you whether
[45:00] you can have a religious service and
[45:02] worship god or not and it has to be
[45:04] according to them
[45:05] that's dictatorship that's right out
[45:09] there
[45:10] that's dictatorship amen
[45:15] to me that's true freedom yeah we would
[45:18] advise you not to we don't want you to
[45:20] but if you're gonna you're gonna
[45:21] but not because we didn't warn you your
[45:24] blood's off of our their hands because
[45:25] they warned you is that right
[45:27] give us your warning thank you very much
[45:29] but now i want to do what i want to do
[45:31] spiritually
[45:31] if it kills me
[45:37] come on people when we chose to serve
[45:41] the lord
[45:42] amen we give up our own lives we take up
[45:45] our cross if and if
[45:46] we die like he did that's all fine amen
[45:50] all i know is if we go to jail today
[45:52] come we go to jail
[45:53] because we're having church praise be to
[45:57] god
[45:58] hallelujah we can suffer for christ
[46:01] glory
[46:02] hallelujah let's sing some songs these
[46:05] jail doors are about to shake like they
[46:07] did for paul
[46:13] we're under the power of god hey that
[46:15] wasn't in the script so
[46:17] you just take it from wherever you want
[46:18] to take that from
[46:21] but isn't it the truth we live in the
[46:23] world we still have freedom
[46:25] praise be to god isn't into something
[46:28] isn't it strange that the things that
[46:31] i'm saying here
[46:32] some of us might be ooh be careful
[46:34] brother about
[46:37] huh are we really living in a country
[46:39] where i got to be who be careful what i
[46:40] say
[46:42] huh shouldn't be
[46:46] because if i say something that's off
[46:47] the word i won't have a congregation
[46:49] am i right but for us to have to fear
[46:53] because the government
[46:54] don't like what she says well that's
[46:57] just a different story
[47:01] amen but freedom amen the country we
[47:03] live in the surroundings our area
[47:05] amen our country we appreciate it we're
[47:07] thankful for that freedom
[47:10] many many many many man has been shot in

[47:16] of their body blowed off their legs

[47:20] millions of them so that you and i could
[47:23] sit here

[47:27] yeah that's what they need to be telling
[47:29] our kids in school
[47:31] buddy i tell you what if i was the head
[47:33] of the teachers they would learn what
[47:35] their
[47:35] what our constitution is they would
[47:37] learn what people
[47:39] how they died and the way that they died
[47:41] and the 18 and 20 year old boys that
[47:43] sacrificed their lives were scared to
[47:45] death but fought anyway and died anyway
[47:47] so that they could have freedom amen
[47:51] maybe it would cause people to
[47:53] appreciate it more
[47:54] but they take it for granted

[51:06] it's simply their own fault
[51:11] amen because why look at what god has
[51:13] done now let me tell you something one
[51:15] of the greatest things
[51:16] that all of humanity is guilty for of
[51:19] absolutely taking for granted
[51:22] and that is god's goodness i was looking
[51:25] under a couple quotes about taking for
[51:27] granted and so forth and he
[51:28] brother bannon was talking about you
[51:30] know people take the salvation for
[51:31] granted he says you know as long as
[51:33] you're drawing breath
[51:34] he says your sins are under the blood
[51:36] and you can have pardon
[51:38] and you can be forgiven and you can get
[51:40] right with god but when you
[51:41] are take that last breath and go out
[51:43] yonder you're out from under that blood
[51:45] you're not privileged anymore
[51:46] whatever you are you are forever amen
[51:51] and people take and absolutely take for
[51:54] granted
[51:54] the goodness of god that's another thing
[51:58] that people take for granted
[52:00] is the goodness of god those who take
[52:04] god's goodness for granted
[52:06] will experience his wrath
[52:09] amen so i'm trusting tonight that's why
[52:12] we're here tonight is because we are not
[52:14] taking for granted
[52:15] what god did for us we will not take for
[52:18] granted what god has done for us
[52:20] what he has supplied for us what he has
[52:22] given us and that is his word
[52:24] that is his very own life that he gave
[52:27] for us
[52:28] so that you could be free so that you
[52:30] could be happy
[52:32] so that you could have the holy ghost
[52:36] amen another thing i found when we're in
[52:40] looking up these quotes but the bam
[52:41] talked about how that
[52:42] joseph and mary had it there they were
[52:45] on their way back home
[52:46] they were on their way back home and
[52:48] they took for granted that jesus was
[52:50] with him
[52:50] but found out he really wasn't because
[52:53] they took for granted that he was there
[52:55] and he wasn't he says that's exactly
[52:57] what our churches have done
[52:59] is they are taking for granted that
[53:01] jesus is with them
[53:02] and how many knows to actually put him
[53:04] outside and now they're taking for
[53:06] granted that he's still there
[53:08] and he's not there
[53:11] they just take for granted or presume
[53:14] that he's there and when the tribulation
[53:18] sets in
[53:19] they'll find out that he's not really
[53:21] there they just took for granted that he
[53:23] was
[53:24] they thought that they could live the
[53:26] way they want to live do the way they
[53:28] want to do
[53:29] is that right and that jesus would still
[53:31] be there
[53:33] but they're going to find out that
[53:35] they're presuming was wrong
[53:37] amen we take
[53:41] for granted our family
[53:45] many times our friends and they're right
[53:50] we take our church a lot of times for
[53:52] granted
[53:54] and so forth amen children
[53:57] take their parents for granted
[54:01] and even get disrespectful and
[54:04] disobedient
[54:06] amen when those kids if they'd really
[54:09] not
[54:10] take their parents for granted and
[54:12] realize
[54:13] the work the labor the struggle the love
[54:17] that the parents have put into that
[54:18] child from the day that it was born
[54:22] amen they would never
[54:25] disrespect their parents they would
[54:28] always let their parents
[54:29] have the last word because they brought
[54:32] them into the world if it wasn't for
[54:34] them they wouldn't even be here
[54:36] i mean how he believes that parents
[54:38] deserve
[54:39] respect absolutely they deserve respect
[54:44] and it is only when their parent kids
[54:45] take their parents for granted
[54:47] that they become disrespectful amen
[54:52] praise the lord we take our youth
[54:57] for granted never we don't think about
[55:00] it
[55:01] it's something we know that is true amen
[55:07] but when you get to be about 60
[55:11] you realize by 70.
[55:15] i don't know about that now
[55:18] i was going out to the barn and i had
[55:22] taken me a nap today so i
[55:23] could preach tonight i got up and i got
[55:26] out there and my knee hurt
[55:31] oh my god said my goodness what's wrong
[55:35] with me
[55:36] i had to loosen up a little you know but
[55:39] we take our youth for granted
[55:41] i mean as we think you're going to be
[55:43] always young
[55:44] you're not always going to be young it
[55:46] doesn't take very long
[55:49] hello and it's gone your strength is
[55:52] gone
[55:53] amen i was lifting some barbells just
[55:55] trying to keep
[55:56] strong is that right brother glenn you
[55:59] know at 59.60 we better do a little pump
[56:02] and if we're going to make it
[56:02] 70 and still have any kind of strength
[56:07] you don't even do that well see i
[56:09] thought about lightening the weights up
[56:11] i said i looked over there and i said if
[56:12] something's too heavy
[56:14] is that just too heavy for a six year
[56:15] old because i think i'm young yet
[56:19] then i heard in the elbows at night now
[56:21] something's going on here
[56:23] i'm just taking for granted that i'm
[56:25] still young and i need to wake up
[56:27] [Music]
[56:28] amen 75 pounds really shouldn't be too
[56:32] much for me
[56:36] anyway we take our youth for granted
[56:40] amen and don't realize one day
[56:44] amen will be old
[56:47] amen people won't even recognize the
[56:49] hardly anymore
[56:51] because it's changed so much think about
[56:54] it
[56:56] sometimes i wished i would have said
[56:58] more to my family my brothers and
[56:59] sisters
[57:01] say well god bless you my brother god
[57:03] bless you my sister
[57:04] if we don't meet another 16 years it'll
[57:06] be an eternity maybe
[57:08] in another 16 years this is the last lap
[57:10] so to speak
[57:12] you know i'm saying this could be the
[57:13] last time we see each other we made the
[57:14] only see each other now at funerals
[57:16] that's where we're at amen
[57:19] simon believes it's time not to take
[57:21] things for granted don't take life
[57:23] for granted amen
[57:27] and you know that's what i realized i
[57:28] think that's one the one thing that i
[57:31] kind of maybe perhaps brought me even to
[57:33] this was the fact that we
[57:35] take life itself for granted
[57:40] we take life itself more than anything
[57:43] else
[57:44] for granted we don't
[57:48] we don't we take for granted and we
[57:50] think we're going to live
[57:51] to get old nothing's going to happen to
[57:55] us
[57:55] but we hear where a bunch of young
[57:58] people whole car load gets killed here
[58:01] all right this other person just drops
[58:03] dead or whatever no
[58:04] and we don't realize we take for granted
[58:06] and don't realize that anything could
[58:07] happen to us
[58:10] anything we take our health
[58:14] for granted we eat all the whoppers we
[58:18] can
[58:21] isn't that right i mean it's two for
[58:22] five dollars come on folks
[58:28] i ate so many of them things to my heart
[58:32] what am i doing i can't keep doing this
[58:35] but i'm gonna have to get some uh some
[58:37] advice from brother
[58:39] glenn because i'll tell you what when
[58:41] you get older you don't eat right your
[58:43] body tells you stuff i think you better
[58:45] listen
[58:46] that's right go home and drink a
[58:49] two big old spoon full of olive oil one
[58:52] in the morning
[58:53] and at night doing me good and not so
[58:56] many whoppers
[58:58] but we take health for granted
[59:02] all right my sister-in-law kathy as you
[59:05] all know
[59:06] she came down with cancer right my
[59:09] sister susie
[59:10] and then rebecca my first cousin she
[59:12] came down with cancer breast cancer she
[59:14] had to have both breasts removed and
[59:15] everything else
[59:16] i talked to her up there and uh i talked
[59:19] to her about it and she said
[59:21] and i said so she changed your dodge he
[59:23] says yeah four four
[59:24] five years ago we went to all organic
[59:28] huh kathy the same way we're going
[59:31] organic
[59:32] folks we are going to think about our
[59:33] health we're going to think about what
[59:34] we eat
[59:36] right we get serious about our health
[59:39] when we find out
[59:40] that we're about to die
[59:43] we find out our health is pretty
[59:45] important but sometimes we take it for
[59:47] granted too long
[59:49] it's why we get the place where we do
[59:52] amen
[59:52] we think we can eat anything any way we
[59:54] want to amen
[59:56] and then we pay for it because we take
[59:58] for granted that we're always going to
[59:59] be healthy but no
[1:00:01] but you take people that treasure let me
[1:00:03] tell you something
[1:00:04] you will not take life for granted
[1:00:08] these young people
[1:00:11] folks it would you know these in these x
[1:00:13] games
[1:00:14] have you ever seen them guys flipping
[1:00:15] the motorcycle over twice
[1:00:18] you know and doing all kinds of crazy
[1:00:20] stuff
[1:00:21] they're taking life for granted
[1:00:24] they make this one little wrong turn
[1:00:26] they're done
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:31] and so we once you get a little bit
[1:00:33] older you get wise enough to know not to
[1:00:35] play with your life
[1:00:37] isn't that right you say well it may be
[1:00:40] very
[1:00:40] bold it is the bravest thing that you've
[1:00:42] ever died never seen nobody be so bold
[1:00:46] ultimately i ain't never seen somebody
[1:00:47] so stupid
[1:00:52] that's right sure it's brave sure it's
[1:00:54] that but to think that you might be
[1:00:56] paralyzed from the neck down
[1:00:57] i had a friend of mine that i worked
[1:00:59] with way back when i was 18
[1:01:01] and he dove into a pond without really
[1:01:03] checking it out first there was rocks
[1:01:04] under there
[1:01:05] he hit his head and for the rest of his
[1:01:07] life he was paralyzed from the neck down
[1:01:10] now that wasn't necessarily foolishness
[1:01:11] okay he was just taking a swim but but
[1:01:13] didn't check it
[1:01:14] but you take any of those things and
[1:01:16] when you put the price on it
[1:01:18] you realize it's not worth the price
[1:01:22] amen so and
[1:01:25] and how many knows that when i talk
[1:01:27] about life that we take for granted most
[1:01:29] of all
[1:01:30] isn't that what exactly what the prophet
[1:01:31] preached on talking about life
[1:01:33] thirsting for life how the whole world
[1:01:35] thirsts for life and that's what we
[1:01:37] really want what we really desire if
[1:01:39] that's why
[1:01:39] armies are amish that's why men and i
[1:01:41] are mennonite that's why all these
[1:01:43] people are what they are because
[1:01:45] they want to live
[1:01:48] amen we want what eternal life because
[1:01:51] this mortal
[1:01:52] life is just a very short span
[1:01:56] very we take that for granted that we're
[1:01:59] mortal we think we're immortal
[1:02:01] people doing all that stuff think
[1:02:02] they're immortal almost act immortal
[1:02:05] and they almost are getting away with it
[1:02:10] amen desperation
[1:02:13] signs of his coming should throw every
[1:02:15] member of christ
[1:02:17] into desperation now about
[1:02:21] our souls
[1:02:24] how many knows that's one thing that we
[1:02:26] take for granted
[1:02:28] is our souls our soul
[1:02:32] is our life people take it too much
[1:02:35] for granted jesus said whosoever will
[1:02:39] save his life shall lose it and
[1:02:41] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:02:43] shall find it for what shall it profit a
[1:02:47] man if he because gain the whole world
[1:02:49] and lose
[1:02:50] his own soul how many knows that's truly
[1:02:54] what we're interested in
[1:02:56] is our soul and people
[1:03:00] will neglect their soul
[1:03:08] moment of silence because that is so
[1:03:10] true
[1:03:12] we will not neglect our natural things
[1:03:15] hardly at
[1:03:16] all but when it comes to your soul is
[1:03:19] your soul ready to meet
[1:03:22] god before 12 o'clock tonight
[1:03:31] how do you take care of your soul do you
[1:03:34] feed your soul on the word of god is it
[1:03:37] more important than anything else in the
[1:03:38] world
[1:03:39] or do we neglect it
[1:03:43] do we
[1:03:47] take it for granted
[1:03:50] because i guarantee you not very many of
[1:03:53] us probably
[1:03:54] have been told by the doctor look you've
[1:03:56] got cancer
[1:03:57] can't be cured can't help you i've never
[1:04:00] been told hopefully i never will but i
[1:04:02] grant you
[1:04:02] for those who have it's a shock or even
[1:04:05] to think
[1:04:06] that you have cancer
[1:04:10] huh to say that hey you're going to die
[1:04:15] how many knows most people will get
[1:04:16] serious they'll spend their fortune
[1:04:20] huh they'll do whatever they can
[1:04:25] to stay alive they want to live amen
[1:04:28] and jesus even said what is it profit if
[1:04:31] you gain the whole world and lose your
[1:04:33] soul
[1:04:34] i heard brother brown preaching uh
[1:04:36] yesterday i think it was he talked about
[1:04:38] how that
[1:04:38] what if i don't know i don't know the
[1:04:40] exact things here but
[1:04:42] he says what if jesus if god would tell
[1:04:44] you look i'm going to let you for
[1:04:46] let you live for 20 million years
[1:04:49] it was a big number like that i'm gonna
[1:04:51] let you live and be
[1:04:52] live for 20 million years and i'm gonna
[1:04:55] make you the king of the whole world
[1:04:57] for that time
[1:05:03] all right he offers that
[1:05:06] or you can have a hard life of hardship
[1:05:10] and so forth but he says but no no this
[1:05:12] is what it was
[1:05:13] at the end of that but at the end of
[1:05:16] those years
[1:05:17] you'll be annihilated you'll become
[1:05:19] extinct you'll you'll be dead
[1:05:21] you'll you'll die
[1:05:25] you know he says i wouldn't want that
[1:05:28] i wouldn't want not even if i was
[1:05:30] offered that kind of a
[1:05:32] lifespan because eventually
[1:05:36] it would come around the years would be
[1:05:38] up
[1:05:40] and he would die how much better it is
[1:05:43] to have eternal life is what the point
[1:05:46] that he was trying to get is to see
[1:05:49] so folks how many knows we take time
[1:05:52] time itself we take for granted
[1:05:56] amen peter and caleb
[1:06:01] peter how old are you now forgot
[1:06:04] caleb's about 36 i think about 36.
[1:06:09] what can't we all remember when they
[1:06:10] were 15 16 17 here
[1:06:12] right another 15 years up there around
[1:06:16] 50
[1:06:17] huh we take time for granted like it's
[1:06:20] just going to go on
[1:06:22] and on and on but how many knows time's
[1:06:24] running out
[1:06:26] not only for the world but for every one
[1:06:28] of us time
[1:06:29] is running out and we don't think about
[1:06:33] it
[1:06:33] like it says taking for granted is not
[1:06:35] thinking about it
[1:06:36] we don't think about it amen
[1:06:40] but how many times did prophet god say
[1:06:43] look
[1:06:44] and let me ask you this one more
[1:06:46] question
[1:06:48] what's the worst thing that can happen
[1:06:50] to us in this world
[1:06:53] this is a message question what's the
[1:06:55] worst thing that can happen to you in
[1:06:57] this world
[1:06:57] getting up and i remember up at brother
[1:06:59] billy's years ago
[1:07:00] brother john might remember when that
[1:07:02] gas truck turned over right
[1:07:04] and caught fire didn't they say he burnt
[1:07:07] up
[1:07:09] i'm not sure if people heard him
[1:07:11] screaming yeah in the air
[1:07:14] that would be a horrible way to die to
[1:07:16] drive a gas truck to get him off into
[1:07:18] the off the side of the road
[1:07:19] flip over and have that thing burn you
[1:07:21] and hear people see you screaming and
[1:07:23] screaming
[1:07:25] burn it to death what a horrible way to
[1:07:28] go
[1:07:29] that would be one of the worst way to go
[1:07:32] trapped in the car
[1:07:33] if i remember right brother bam says
[1:07:35] he's seen people die a lot of ways
[1:07:36] what's the worst thing that can happen
[1:07:38] to you can somebody tell me
[1:07:42] that's right sister hannah but everyone
[1:07:45] says the worst thing that can happen to
[1:07:46] you in this world
[1:07:47] is for you to go out of this world and
[1:07:49] not know the lord jesus christ
[1:07:51] that's the most horrible thing it's
[1:07:53] worse than burning up
[1:07:55] worse than any any kind of thing you
[1:07:57] could experience is for you to
[1:07:59] not be ready when your time comes
[1:08:04] why because over there how many knows is
[1:08:05] nothing but a
[1:08:07] nightmare over there and then it'll be
[1:08:09] the judgment and then it'll be damnation
[1:08:11] it's a horrible thing
[1:08:13] to have to go out of this world without
[1:08:14] knowing the lord jesus christ
[1:08:20] one more thing that i thought about this
[1:08:22] week about whether
[1:08:24] a church
[1:08:27] well let me let me let me let me pick
[1:08:28] this up here
[1:08:30] desperation we should be desperate our
[1:08:33] souls
[1:08:34] our welfare for hereafter
[1:08:38] that we are going to amount to if we
[1:08:40] gain the whole world
[1:08:42] what are we living for what do you work
[1:08:45] for
[1:08:45] what are you eating for
[1:08:48] what are you struggling for to live
[1:08:54] amen isn't that what we wanted
[1:08:57] to live and jesus came that we might
[1:09:00] have life
[1:09:01] and have it more abundantly all the
[1:09:03] father has given me
[1:09:04] will come to me and i will raise it up
[1:09:07] at the last day i mean us jesus came
[1:09:09] to give us eternal life
[1:09:15] totally free just receive it how many
[1:09:17] knows the world
[1:09:19] is completely taking it for granted
[1:09:22] totally ignoring it not taking serious
[1:09:26] not taking
[1:09:27] thought about it that's why they won't
[1:09:28] receive it why
[1:09:30] let's go on on the let me let me just
[1:09:31] finish this struggling for to live
[1:09:34] what are you living for to die and
[1:09:36] you're not fit to live
[1:09:38] until you're fit to die that's true
[1:09:41] amen
[1:09:45] desperations how many beliefs we need to
[1:09:48] be in desperation
[1:09:50] and the reason he says that we're not in
[1:09:51] desperation is because of a lack
[1:09:54] of the love of god amen
[1:09:57] i think the love of god causes
[1:09:59] desperations if god is in you the token
[1:10:02] inside of you
[1:10:03] and you see the conditions of the times
[1:10:05] and people
[1:10:06] waiting in sin the way that they are
[1:10:09] it'll throw you into desperation
[1:10:12] i mean those love of god puts you in
[1:10:14] desperation for people
[1:10:16] that don't know god
[1:10:20] one thing i've thought about the amish
[1:10:21] man in the night or any church that
[1:10:23] includes this one
[1:10:24] i have a little bit of a
[1:10:28] missionary part to give sunday morning
[1:10:31] but
[1:10:32] one way to tell whether a church is
[1:10:33] right or not
[1:10:35] is if they are trying to fulfill the
[1:10:40] commission that jesus gave the church
[1:10:44] amen what was the commission
[1:10:49] that's right when he rose from the dead
[1:10:52] everything he said was this is what i
[1:10:54] want you to do
[1:10:55] go you into all the world and preach the
[1:10:57] gospel to every
[1:10:59] creature amen

[1:11:04] gospel a church
[1:11:05] that is not reaching out for lost souls

[1:11:09] their heart for people that don't know
[1:11:11] god hello
[1:11:12] they have no reaching out no burden for
[1:11:16] the people out there that don't know god
[1:11:18] is not the church of god amen
[1:11:22] because the church of god has a
[1:11:23] commission and they will go into all the
[1:11:25] world they will do what they can
[1:11:27] amen how many
[1:11:30] that's that should be our desire because
[1:11:33] listen when we come down to the door of
[1:11:34] death it isn't going to matter how much
[1:11:36] money you make
[1:11:38] that's going to have helped you live
[1:11:39] good here money helps you live good here
[1:11:42] but it's not what they're going to count
[1:11:44] for you on the day
[1:11:45] on that day on that day it's only what
[1:11:47] you have done for christ
[1:11:49] what did you do to try to help somebody
[1:11:51] else come into the kingdom of god amen
[1:11:57] and i don't know about you but i know
[1:11:58] that i need more of the love of god in
[1:12:00] my heart when i see people that
[1:12:02] amen that really need don't know really
[1:12:05] which way to go what to do amen
[1:12:08] and i haven't cared enough seems like
[1:12:12] to do more amen i just say lord help me
[1:12:15] amen
[1:12:16] use me where you can help me to feel for
[1:12:19] people
[1:12:20] that's ultimately the goal look we're
[1:12:22] all trying to make heaven
[1:12:24] amen and jesus jesus as brother braham
[1:12:26] said
[1:12:27] should be the what is it called
[1:12:30] it should be the tie of the thai post of
[1:12:33] every belief
[1:12:34] it's the thing that every person that
[1:12:37] names the name of christ
[1:12:39] should have in common and that is christ
[1:12:42] is the way
[1:12:43] jesus is the way it would put everything
[1:12:46] else aside
[1:12:47] and bring his right to christ amen
[1:12:50] people neglect their soul people neglect
[1:12:53] salvation and man they just take for
[1:12:55] granted
[1:12:56] they will always have the opportunity
[1:12:58] for something no it's not always going
[1:12:59] to have
[1:13:00] is it god's provide provision to
[1:13:03] absolutely take for granted
[1:13:05] that god has made a way
[1:13:12] how many believes he's made a way in
[1:13:13] this hour
[1:13:15] in the midst of a thousand different
[1:13:17] ways to go
[1:13:19] even if he didn't
[1:13:22] i would say in the midst of all of this
[1:13:25] confusion die
[1:13:26] god really needs to come down and he
[1:13:28] needs to come down and prove
[1:13:30] a way so that we can know without a
[1:13:32] doubt this is the way to go
[1:13:34] otherwise we're going to be in confusion
[1:13:38] and hasn't he done just that yes he has
[1:13:41] he has done just that so prove so
[1:13:44] vindicated
[1:13:46] amen that when you you can tell people
[1:13:50] look i can prove to you
[1:13:52] that jesus came in this hour and he
[1:13:53] proved that he was still alive
[1:13:55] he proved what was right amen through
[1:13:59] malachi 4. if i haven't told you the
[1:14:02] truth you can put a sign on my back
[1:14:04] if jesus christ doesn't come down here
[1:14:06] and prove and vindicate what i've just
[1:14:08] said
[1:14:08] you can call me a false prophet and run
[1:14:09] me out of the city
[1:14:11] did jesus show up every time
[1:14:16] people don't even accept proof anymore
[1:14:18] they don't accept
[1:14:19] evidence anymore amen
[1:14:23] that's why even paul was saying look
[1:14:25] many infallible signs and so forth he's
[1:14:28] done
[1:14:30] okay
[1:14:33] praise the lord your soul
[1:14:36] salvation all of these things we could
[1:14:39] go on couldn't we
[1:14:40] but mostly the goodness and the grace of
[1:14:42] god when the judgment
[1:14:44] day comes as the prophet of god said the
[1:14:46] question that god is going to be asking
[1:14:48] people is
[1:14:49] why did you neglect or

[1:15:30] creation

[1:15:36] that they won't have to come to judgment
[1:15:39] but how many knows
[1:15:41] it will there'll be a judgment day
