week so far amen certainly is a good time of the year amen can't think of any special announcements or anything other than just remember saturday amen for those of you want to come may eat some chili and so forth danny good to see you praise the lord let's bow our heads kind of heavenly father we come before you once again lord coming into your house lord jesus and to see father what you would have to say to us lord jesus asking god that you just be with both the speaker and the hear we just pray lord that you would have the preeminence in the service lord jesus that you would have your perfect way lord which that which you have known would be father we just ask god we fall right in line with it that we be in your perfect will lord and everything that is said and done bless the reading of your word the meditation of our heart now thus each one that has come out we ask god the special special blessing upon each one and lord those listening we ask god that you would just bless a special blessing on them also leaders guide us closer to you lord in these terrible times that we live father we ask these blessings in jesus name amen and amen this evening i want to take one of god's attributes or titles amen that he has and that is uh the redeemer amen so tonight we're going to talk about the redeemer for a while is that okay amen so that's amen it certainly is a subject the more i got to study in it the more i realized uh really it's just all everything that it ties into amen so we just want to go as far as the lord will have us to go tonight and go from there would that be okay let's turn to isaiah first if you will the book of isaiah okay thank you sorry all right i thought when i went back there it got a little quiet i was like well what's that amen so isaiah the 44th chapter amen there's some things that didn't cover sunday but i will just leave it for now maybe we'll pick it up after a little bit but in isaiah 44 verse 22 we want to read i have blotted out as a thick cloud by transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee sing o e heavens for the lord hath done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest and every tree therein for the lord hath redeemed jacob glor glorified himself in israel now let's turn over to the book of revelations if you would let's go to the book of revelations revelations the sixth chapter i believe it is or five i believe it is revelations 5. and we want to read verse 1 all the way through 10 and that's on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to take to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth nor under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the twenty four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden biles full of voters which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on earth may god add his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated now this is uh one of the greatest events perhaps since the time of christ actually dying on the cross amen because this gives it away of what book this is brother bannerman the breach talks about this he calls this the book of redemption how many remembers that many times he calls this book his seventh sealed book the book of redemption amen this whole this whole thing that the whole bible the whole thing is a book how many believes that this this this bible even is a book of redemption amen now let me see i'm going to read you a couple things about the meaning of uh redeem what it means to redeem because we know that as god he is our redeemer amen i like that because the the verse nine i really like because they said they sang a new song and saying thou art the reason that he was worthy to take that book was because he had redeemed no no no the first one was because for thou was slain right so the first point was that he had paid the price right he had actually paid the price amen to be able to touch that book no isaiah no david no solomon it doesn't matter elijah of the old testament john the baptist the new it didn't matter who it was it wasn't the prophet great enough there was not a man or a human being great enough to be able to look upon even right and then in verse 4 it says that john the revelator wept much because no man was found to open or to even read of the book neither to look there on so we realized john realized that if nobody was worthy to touch that book or to take that book all of creation all of humanity was lost isn't that right everything was lost if somebody can't take this book amen so we call this a book of redemption because that's really what it is that's what christ my redeemer died on the cross as the song says isn't that right amen paid all are due amen amen so we know that he was worthy amen over in uh in revelations 13th chapter and verse 8 it says and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world amen so we find a group of people that has their names in this book how many believe that you have to have your name in that book now we are taught know that there's a song that talks about there's another name that was written down last night because somebody came to the altar amen and they gave their heart to the lord so now there's a new name written in heaven and the prophet taught no that's not when the names are written it wasn't last night the night before if your name ever was written on there it was written there before the foundation of the world amen i'm here to tell you i'm telling you right now the people in the church world and the religious realm amen it doesn't matter you have to fit your mind to the word of god and the way that god thinks not the way that you want to make it fit amen and you've got to realize that god wrote the book of revelations 2 000 years ago he told us exactly how it would go what everything all the different things that would happen he talks about what it's going to be like in the millennium he talked about the new heavens and the new earth on the other side of the thousand years then the devil will be loosed yet foreseen it's because god knows everything people don't realize god knows everything he he's omniscient he al all knowing which we can't comprehend but he is and he wrote those names down amen in one of these days we're told that that last one is that last name is gonna come and be redeemed right and then in other words it's going to come to the saving grace of almighty god and when that last one comes in it's all over them there's not one more going to come in amen so we want to look at this you know and i just want to say this when you talk about redemption i wanted to talk to you about the meaning of redemption and i looked this up took me just a few minutes to to come in which i like to take what the prophet of god said about what redeemed means all right now notice the brother of god says now listen he says uh he says if you've got if you ever got eternal life you were part of god's attributes part of his thinking because you've got eternal life jesus came as a redeemer and to redeem means to bring it back to where it once was or to where it started at amen so when we think about anything that is brought back from a state perhaps to where it was at one time in that right many times we talk about it brings in it brings in restoration right it means we find restoration in it because amen it's fallen from what it once was amen and we all know that that's exactly what the sons and daughters of god amen god had an intent god had a thought for his sons and daughters of god but because of the fall right amen we were lost we become completely lost sons and daughters of god that were completely lost and he had to come and find us and bring us back to himself again amen so there's uh there's there's restoration he meant to restore something you take a car you see anything like that you know it was once beautiful and so forth and what will they do they will restore back to its original condition and that's what christ is in the business of restoration that's just one thing and we want to maybe touch on and and then also i'll just mention a few because i'm just going to follow the leading on which one of these takes them to go with because amen we could preach all night on just restoration amen how many knows we're going back to the garden of eden again god is restoring us taking us back to the garden of eden again to where we were one place one time we were there adam was there and man we were supposed to be on there and continue on but we lost our way so to speak because of what adam did amen and then uh we think about that savior being being saved is part of uh uh redemption i mean believes that the greatest song of all i believe it's amazing grace how sweet i once was lost but now i'm restored back again i've been redeemed i've been brought back again now god has redeemed me back again oh my y'all's held onto your seats now don't get too happy about that but isn't that the truth though when you think about amen one time you don't you didn't know what it was like to have peace and joy you didn't know what it was like to have forgiveness of your sins and to know that you don't have to go to judgment anymore you don't have to worry about the white throne judgment and have everything that you ever did to come up before you and having to answer for all of that and the fear the scare of it all amen now you've been already you're already justified now you've already amen that's all taken care of for you aren't you glad for that why oh when i think about this it encumbers so much it actually even encumbers resurrection even resurrection how in the world is redemption has to do with resurrection well the prophet taught us that you know resurrection is not to pick something else up resurrection is when you drop something all right it's to pick that very same thing right back up again what goes on that's the resurrect something that's a it means something that's fallen it comes and brings it back again right to the same place again amen so even our natural bodies if you go by the weight of grave man how many knows god will restore that he'll bring it back and redeem it back to itself the way it's supposed to be amen no there's just so much there's reconciliation there's deliverance right this is deliverance at one time you were a captive you were a slave you ended up on shop the devil had rights from you for you and so forth because at one time the devil didn't have no rights without him no rights he couldn't touch him but he not the devil but we know that adam sold us off into the pawnshop we couldn't we couldn't overcome we couldn't get off the shelf if we tried but now god paid the price he picks us back up and he restores us again redeems us back to himself again praise be to god all right now think about that oh my let me just tell you a little story of how the prophet put it now we wonder why the revival is not going on right now you know we we we we as folks we we have no idea we have no idea what revival really is how many knows back in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s when billy graham all robbers tommy hicks all of these you know if you could come out here and put a tent up and hold a thousand people a thousand people would come go up put it up there now it's just your church stragglers he's all you did you know but back then it was revival folks somebody else they had to review what's going on but even at the end of brother brennan's ministry we know it got soda where people were so starchy and he was starting to settle down and and he talked about fight revivals and so forth brother bam says you ain't gonna have no more i say it in the name of the lord you're never going to have those type of right those are over with now and here he's beginning to talk about this why don't we have these revivals and what's going on now and listen to what what he kind of has in his mind of how it works and i like it why there's not a revival going on why don't we see the enthusiasm with the people i don't know why but let's just think what if it's like this maybe there's a little boy in here tonight or a little girl was just born over in seattle amen we might say hopkinsville or this that the other or whatever you might say there's just somebody young yet right and and that book holds her name huh a little girl there's you know there's that name there and he come to redeem whose names was on that book how many know that's what he come for that's what christ went to calvary for was to redeem those names again he says me and uh redeemed means to bring back from where it fell from amen and in the human race she was fallen and she can't accept it right now she's too young so the church will just slug right along it'll just seem hum drum and kind of dry this out of the that last person is brought in then the book is closed in other words god's gonna keep things going until that last book i can't help but believe that's what we're doing we're just keeping on keeping on keeping on until that last one comes in and becomes redeemed folks help me know you you couldn't blow us up you couldn't kill that child you could have all the car wrecks she could be in car wrecks and the only one that lives she could be in a train wreck the only one to live but god is not going to lose one of his children you wonder why people got bubbles around them you wonder why people can get uh you know and get so close to that but they still live or they can walk away unscathed it's all in god's hands folks even when you were a sinner if you were god's child god was watching over you praise the lord i'd have died many times brother us we've died plenty times some of us out there that's right if it wouldn't have been for god watching over us amen oh my thank god for his grace amen aren't you glad for this great redeemer or the person that kind of he brings things back he restores he takes us out of captivity and restores again to freedom folks you can be all stiff and starch and lukewarm tonight god can restore you he can bring you back to enjoy the same joy that you had at the beginning like david said lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation because that's what god does say samson wasn't a samson that as his hair grew back he no not pray god i need a little redemption here huh i've gotten myself in a terrible place but i'd like to be back like i once was and god granted him his desire and redeemed his strength back to him and he did one more mighty thing before he passed away amen a mighty redeemer these people were glad they were happy they sang a new song said you're worthy huh there ain't nobody no they know muhammad ain't nobody worthy amen only one person is worthy and that is the lord jesus christ why do you think whatever you do in wording do you do all in the name of the lord jesus christ oh my you know what's pathetic some churches if you don't baptize in the titles of the name they get upset with you they'll get mad because because you baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ what kind of pathetic is that he's the one that died for you there's no other name given under heaven more by you must be saved the highest name that there is why wouldn't you want to go ahead and baptize in the highest name there is amen i'll let me tell you why because people have a false doctrine spirit on them that's the only reason why they get mad because you're right and they want to be right i don't care whether uh you know i i don't you know i don't care if i'm wrong you know as far as fighting for it i want to be right right why don't they say well i don't care you know whether i'm right or wrong all i want is really be right but they got this spirit on them well i'm wrong and that's what i want to be you know no it's terrible it's a bad spirit all right now i know this so how many is glad for this now let's just look at this for a few minutes over in over in leviticus first of all now we read here that if if this if this jesus that was slain did a work of redemption it has to be according to god's law not just anybody can redeem you right in leviticus 25 i'll tell you what kind of a person it has to be in order to redeem you and if they so verse 47 leviticus 40 25 verse 47 if a sojourner now he talks about how that you know how they could become and sell themselves to their brothers and their sisters and it says you know that they are not to rule over each other verse 46 with vigor but if a sojourner or perhaps a stranger comes around or stranger it says wax rich by thee and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and your brother sells himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee or to the stock of the stranger's family now i think what i see in this picture is adam selling us out to the devil don't you a stranger right not even family all right after that he is sold he may redeem be redeemed again one of his brothers he says may redeem him either his uncle or his son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him or if he be not or if he be able he can redeem himself amen let me know can you imagine that that's hardly going to happen though isn't it when you're broke you're so broke that you had to sell yourself in the first place you probably won't be able to redeem yourself that's kind of condition that we were in amen there ain't no way for us to redeem ourselves we could not redeem ourselves no man could redeem us why because god demanded amen first of all that that redemption is perfect amen amen and it has to be a person that is of the night nearest kin and we know that god had to become kin to you and i that's why he had to become humanity he couldn't do it as an angel he had to walk like you walk talk like you up have the same temptations like you do but how many knows if this land that was slim it had to be without blemish it couldn't be sinful ain't no man that could redeem your soul we couldn't buy ourselves back and get right with god again because of our sinful condition and jesus christ comes along amen and he was the only one that was absolutely without spot without wrinkle and the only one that was able and that's why john he first of all wept right he wept because no man was worthy amen to take the book nobody was had the ability to do it but jesus christ did when i began to think about this message i began to think about how that really when you talk about redemption you talk about one of the main aspects of the whole plan of god amen it wasn't until i come into the message that i was told that god actually created eve in such a way huh that she would fall that she would fall that's pretty hip you know but you know you might say well that's a little hard for me to swallow but do you realize that he put eve on free moral agency didn't he just like he did the angels that were in heaven that he created that's something else i didn't know that they would put on free moral agency they could choose because how many knows if you wasn't if you wasn't put on free moral agency you would do exactly whatever god put in there for you to do you wouldn't mess up you wouldn't mess up but he puts it on you and a third of the angels of heaven made the wrong choice decided with the devil isn't that right the bible says a third of them and god kicked them out of heaven the first battle that there ever was was in heaven isn't that right that's right amen and he kicked them out they come down on the earth and all those angels now are influencing people they influence eve eve would put on free moral agency god knew what she would do before he ever took her out of the ring and she made the choice she was deceived she listened too much how many knows you can listen to the wrong thing too much until you become convinced because adam it talks about adam was not deceived he willfully walked out to save his wife he knew what he was doing he knew he wasn't supposed to but he wasn't didn't want to let eve go so he willfully walked out and sold us out because of her love his love for her amen but anyway so think about it and of course we realized and i said that to say this that god knew it and there was never going to be no fall unless he makes a channel for it and he knew exactly what it would be and that humanity would go in the direction that it would go that you and i would be here that man would go and i'll tell you what sons and daughters of god would be scattered through all the earth and oh my everything that would happen he knew it all but you know god wanted to express himself because in him was to be a dad in him was to have a son to have children sons and daughters that's when the prophet comes along and he says you know you are also a part of the attributes of god if you are not part of an attribute of god you never will be a part of him ain't no way you'll ever be in heaven if you're not an attribute or part of god and his plan and his thinking amen oh my that's why the believer should have so much joy amen that's why the unbeliever should be so scared amen the sinner should be so scared god you know am i part of him most of the time when there's an unbeliever i ain't going to hear that i ain't going to listen to that i'm out of here that's what they do they don't give a hug but a child of god is lord i want to be yours lord i want to be yours that's why when you make a make a mistake and fall sword and everything else it hurts you down here because you don't want to you want to be right you care about whether you plea are pleasing to your father amen and you want to be a christian and you have a desire to do what's right and and to be in heaven and so forth that desires there amen and we look because god of course we know that he is a father and so forth but he cannot never he'll he never he never you'd never know what it was like you'd never experience him as a redeemer unless you fell huh you'd never know what it's like to get away from god and to get a little cold and sniff on him and oh become miserable right amen and then get down on your knees and say god i'm miserable i'm not like i ought to be restoring me again and god restores you brings you back you say thank god thank you for your grace lord amen he's our redeemer he's your savior he's your deliverer amen let's turn if you will to the book of luke look for do you all remember one place uh i meant to look it up and didn't hell i mean jesus christ makes a statement somewhere and he says because the pharisees kept says we were never in bondage remember that you know they didn't really need jesus how many knows that the pharisees they didn't really need jesus they didn't think they needed him jesus makes a statement something to the order that they which are whole need not a physician right that's what's a lot of people's attitude they think that they're whole they don't need a physician but i mean knows that we all need a position we need the great physician amen we needed him more than what we realized so luke chapter 4 now notice i want you to see how you can see deliverance restoration and redemption in this verse 17 and there was delivered on him to him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted amen once you didn't have a broken heart but if you've got a broken heart god is here to restore that broken heart to bring you back right to preach deliverance at one time you was not needing deliverance adam didn't need deliverance but after we to fall we needed deliverance in other words we were free at one time and now you're captive you need deliverance that's what he come for to preach deliverance to the captives the recovering of the sight of the blind amen and to set at liberty them that are bruised amen it's all restoration it's always bringing back from a uh from the fallen condition that we find ourselves praise be to god aren't you glad for that and just think just think as long as he is on that mercy seat that's what he's doing every day i mean he believes he's still in the business of delivering he's still in the business of restoring god loves to restore god loves to deliver god loves to heal how many knows you get sick you need deliverance you need redemption you need god to come and restore are you back from where you were back to your original state folks i could be at home right now laying in bed with a fever and throwing up in my my garbage can and just feeling horrible huh and laying there and wishing boy i sure wish i feel good and we'll get to feeling good in a few days and feel all good and god did all of that and then we don't even give him praise none and glory thank you lord for healing me thank you for restoring my health thank you for redeeming me from the jaws of death amen oh he's such a great redeemer to bring us back from a fallen place amen that's why those all those men sang a new song thou art worthy because that has redeemed us you have brought us back to god we were away from god and now we're not away from god paul called it the message of reconciliation to reconcile you get in a fight with somebody get in the fuss with somebody get the fuss with your wife what you need reconciliation that's the way it does with with other with us and god we needed reconciliation amen let's read the scripture on ii corinthians 5 and 18 says it this way now notice and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ amen i'm very glad to be brought back into fellowship with god how many knows that our fellowship was severed from almighty god we couldn't have fellowship you couldn't sit in a church pew like you are now and have the sweetness of the holy spirit to be able to raise your hands and say thank you lord you couldn't have him in your heart in the old testament not until you get the baptism of the holy ghost not until you are reconciled brought back into fellowship redeemed why that's why we sing redeemed how i love to proclaim it redeemed by the blood of the lamb amen regime how many is glad to be redeemed to be reconciled amen who has reconciled us unto himself by jesus christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation to it that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself not in imputing them their trespasses unto them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation oh hallelujah how many is glad for that to be reconciled praise be to god to be brought back to back to it's the condition that it's supposed to be there's only one way there is only one thing that we are not reconciled the way that adam was to god you ain't heard that before i got your attention now don't you you used to say that we are completely reconciled to god the way that adam was before the fall but if i don't if i remember right even the prophet made this statement that's why i make it and that is except for this flesh huh let me know this flesh has to be changed amen it has to be changed what it was before the fall then it'll be complete that's why in romans 8 i believe it says we who have the first fruits of the spirit do grown within ourselves waiting to wit the redemption of this body there's one thing left the spirit is the soul is the mind is the heart is but the flesh is not yet amen oh my and we're waiting for that paul said oh my let's look at the another message of restoration to bring back how many believes that we are living in a restored hour joe in job 2 and 23. and the prophet of god is the one that picks this up and he applies it to it and another scripture that the prophet picked up and said there'll be a day that will be neither light nor dark it says but it'll be a dismal day and then the next thing that the scripture says but in the evening time it shall be light amen he applied that to our day through luther through wesley through the dark ages to catholicism it wasn't really bright it wasn't dark it was a dismal day right but here at the evening time all of a sudden the sun is going to come out quiet now how many of the sun came out the sun came out and shined beautifully and bright the bible says in revelations 18 uh and you know there's a angel that went forth and the whole earth was lightened with his glory malachi 4 for the power of god and the powers and the things that he did amen it lightened the earth you don't think them seeks to change and all of those buddhists were i popping open when he says you know if your god can open his lines mane's eyes now let's quit talking let's quit passing tracks coming open this blind man's eyes i'll serve your god but if my god opens this blind man's eye how about serving them how many will that's how it was quit playing around with church complaining amen same way with the sovereignty preachers that want to dispute him with the by god and the baptism and so forth amen and he told them exactly what it would be and what it would not be the man came up and he said you know you might not agree with him but he told me everything would happen brother ram couldn't see further than you and i could see without god coming down and giving him his vision of what would happen that's what visions and dreams just says beginning to tap into the the eyesight the eyeballs of god you kidding his eyeballs and you see the future you see the past you see people what they're thinking what they're saying and so forth amen he applied this be glad then the children of zion this is in joel 2 verse 23 and rejoice in the lord your god for he has given you the former reign moderately and he will cause the rain to come down uh for you the rain the former ant the rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil you ain't never heard the bunch of screaming and hollering the revival that was brought to people that got fed both spiritually and physically and and the healing that took place boy how many knows who you talk about in revival you talk about rejoicing you talk about the stimulation of revelation the oil and the wine and so forth and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cake of worm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied oh folks i don't know about you but i'm satisfied how many satisfied tonight why because god has brought back he has redeemed us back he has brought back the word again in our day all that the catholics and everybody else did of whether it was a godhead they've got the three different gods and their worship i mean baptizing in titles instead of using the name the way they were supposed to kissing mary's feet off and kissing peter toes off and amen they got to trinity god three different gods and all kinds of messed up stuff they got the kosher bread that if you eat that little bread and communion that's the literal body of jesus christ that ain't the literal body of jesus christ that's the symbol of his body is that right i mean just all kinds of things lose to come along west they come along and where and where as they come along a little more came and a little more come right but that was reformation getting a little more but it just i will restore all that that has eaten i will come back and i will show you and i'll have you preaching exactly what paul preached we'll get the holy ghost like paul god we ain't going to put your name on no church book evening like tabernacle don't have no name for you to put on the only way you become a member of this body is by the baptism of the holy ghost by one spirit paul said are we all baptized into one body and become members in particular of particular in him it's the only way to come into the body we got it straight folks how many believes it you could come we could have a name we can put your name on the book we can have a hundred extra names on there that probably never make it but get your name on that his book and then get filled with the holy ghost and get into the body of christ and you're sealed until the day of your redemption how many glad amen that god has brought us back he's redeemed the word again so to speak and honey restored it brought it back to its fullness again all the years the caterpillar and everybody has eaten don't you realize during brother bram's time they were having bible schools and they were pushing them preachers out one after the other and they were going home to mama that had gotten healed amen and they were saying you know mama what are you so happy about his mama says because i went down to the corner on a little old you know a little old church somewhere and they prayed for me now i got healed praise be to god the boy says you know we read in the bible where mark 16 from that verse raised until their hands on the sickness because that part's not even inspired huh how many know these bible schools were teaching there's no such thing as a holy ghost in our day there's no miracles and all though right in the midst of it god comes and proves it all wrong back to the story you want me to finish the story about the mom yeah the moment he said you know and then he said to her son her son said you know that wasn't even inspiring you mean you haven't been down there with them holy rollers and then backwash a little bit have you huh he says well i'll tell you what son if that's not the inspired word she said this she said you know if god can heal me with the uninspired word what can we do with that which is really inspired blurry she got happy isn't that right how many we've had a restoration we have been uh we have something that's been bringing us back he redeemed back back to the way that de paul taught it whether it's a way of salvation whether it's the way to come to god you must be born again you can't just join church no it's got to be a real birth the whole thing praise the lord god is good isn't he oh my when i think about it that's right there's redemption there's restoration redemption amen somebody will do something really bad i haven't regida the uh series version wherever she gets hers from right of what uh to redeem means it says one place to atone or make amends for error or evil huh can you see the lord in that yeah he made an atonement for the air and for the evil huh another one to repay a stock ponderings instrument at the maturity date well anyway i don't understand that one he says to pay the necessary money to clear a net i thought that's good to pay the necessary money to clear that amen that's redemption that's christ our redeemer how many fed for a redeemer how many worships him as redeemer and this great redeemer his name is the lord jesus christ there's no other redeemer amen another one all right it says to buy the freedom of or for to buy your freedom how i'm elise that's what he did he bought our freedom amen you love him tonight when i think about how in every head listen he's our redeemer in almost every aspect of our life i don't believe that your healing he redeems you if you get sick you know uh just so many things you you have uh like i said earlier you know you have a friendship and that friendship falls out wouldn't it be something pedophile says you know the devil brought them back together the devil's no redeemer he doesn't restore stuff he makes things worse but christ he brings it back together if you'll both get under the blood you'll be restored there'll be redemption there again amen think about it so many different aspects of our life aren't you glad for redemption amen we need redemption every day things that happen amen turn with me in closing i want to do one more scripture in ephesians. ephesians 1 and verse 13 in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation amen in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise amen i mean please the holy spirit is that seal and also this holy spirit it says which is the earnest of our inheritance amen so god gives us the baptism of the holy ghost because it's the earnest of our inheritance that's what we possess remember the quarter or the down payment on something that's right a down payment of heaven how many believes you've got you've got the baptism in the holy ghost you've got a down payment of heaven until you have the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession i like that now how many knows what that is that right there is referred to many times to the resurrection right until the time of the redemption of the purchase procession in other words there comes a time when he's going to gather together all that is in christ he's going to cash in everything that he's bought everything that he's purchased everything that he has redeemed now he's going to redeem everything he has redeemed in other words where he's going to take it on the heaven because how many knows paul can't see christ irenaeus the group can't see christ martin's every all of those saints of all the ages there are in their zones so to speak under the altar waiting for the resurrection when brother bannon went beyond the curtain of time and saw millions of people men and women one woman come up there one young looking beautiful woman come up there past him and and the angel said to him don't you remember her he said i don't remember her no and the angel said she was past 90 when you let her the christ and then he was wondering if they're all brandons what is know they said that are your converse those are the ones you led to christ brother branham i have a group that right and he says well i want to see my man i want to see my lord i want to see jesus he said you can't see him yet right no because when we see him we're all going to get the same aren't you glad for that when that redemption when the time comes and he gonna actually catch but he has bought he's gonna bring it back and then we're gonna be with him oh my just think of it now we know that abraham and isaac and jacob and all the old testament they went up into another realm also how many know it believes they're waiting even abel all of them is waiting somewhere because christ is doing the mediator work right now when that is over with i mean believes that's when we're going to crown him king of kings and lord of lords and he's not going to be in the dispensation of the son anymore he's not going to be in the dispensation of the holy ghost anymore because that's what he's now the pillar of fire in each one of our hearts but that's when he goes into son of man son of god which is the holy ghost dispensation and the third one is the son of david he's going to be king of kings and lord of lords amen why did god allow this why did we have to be redeemed back god had us in his mind as sons and daughters before the foundation of the world but when we get over there and this is just a thought of mine are you ready what if we'd never fail fallen what if we'd have never fallen and become sons and daughters of god we'd never learn all the things we've learned we'd have never known god as a redeemer as a savior as a deliverer and every as a father as a leader as a led being led by the spirit isn't that right we'd have never known him as a comforter how many knows when we get over there amen we amazing grace house sweet the sound that saved the reds like me the all the angels will have to be quiet circling around the earth they'll all be quiet and hang their heads they don't know amazing grace they don't know oh what a savior oh let's say we can say that from the bottom of our oh why the savior is mine wonderful glorious amen i mean they're like wow amen and both have character how many knows that that's what god allowed it for so when we get over there we're ready to rule we're ready to be kings and priests unto god amen that's why he allowed it because he wants us to be just like him when evil comes brother brad when evil comes in front of you huh are we going to do like the angels did and side with the devil no we're gonna chew him get thee behind me satan and that's this is the training ground for that over there that was the purpose of it all amen and it was a great purpose it was an awesome purpose great plan huh how many believe god had a great plan it doesn't matter if i get blown up i don't care it doesn't matter if i like paul get my head chopped off paul said that this little suffering that we have in this little time it's not even to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed no matter how much you would suffer here amen to pay off of what you're getting it doesn't even compare i hope everybody out there hears that you'll quit singing the blues so much complaining the whining you'll thank god amen you'll say like paul said i've learned that whatever condition i am in to be content to praise be to god amen you love him how many is glad for the redeemer let's say thank you lord jesus for being redeemer stand with me if you will musicians if you'll come and i want us all to just sing this song with me yet don mike if you'll pull up redeemed how i love to proclaim it we haven't sang that in a while not like to sing it
