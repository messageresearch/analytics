[40:10] people we are tonight, Lord, to be able
[40:13] to be called, the elected, chosen, Lord,
[40:16] positionally placed in that body to
[40:19] worship and serve you to be your
[40:21] matchpiece. Lord, you was looking for
[40:23] character, Father, and you found it
[40:25] right here, Lord, in Elton, Kentucky, a
[40:28] people called out, separated for your
[40:30] name's sake. And Lord, we're so thankful
[40:32] tonight that you've called us. You put a
[40:35] desire in our hearts to worship you, to
[40:37] serve you, Lord, to love you, Father, to
[40:40] to let all the things of this world,
[40:43] Lord, go and be set aside. And God, we
[40:46] just come tonight on a a midweek
[40:48] service, Father, just to draw strength
[40:50] from you. And we pray that you will,
[40:52] Lord, not only anoint the lips of the
[40:54] speaker, but anoint the ears of the
[40:56] hearer, Lord, that we both can be in
[40:59] sync with what the spirit would want to
[41:01] be want to say and what would want to be
[41:03] heard, Father. So we just commit this
[41:05] service to you now, Father. And every
[41:08] life, every need, every situation. May
[41:10] you supply it. Speak to the hearts and
[41:12] lives, Lord, and just anchor the word to
[41:14] us tonight, Lord. May we get grounded
[41:16] and tie our souls, Lord. If it would, as
[41:19] we would say, Lord, to that tpost of the
[41:21] absolute, Lord, by the baptism of the
[41:23] Holy Ghost, we pray you'd just grant it
[41:25] now. Bless this time in Jesus name.
[41:28] Amen. If you have your Bibles, we're
[41:30] going to turn to Jeremiah 29. We're

[42:06] here. Enjoyed the fellowship with
[42:08] different ones. Uh, brother Thomas and I
[42:11] got to spend a little bit of time this
[42:12] morning together. And, you know, he's a
[42:15] fisherman. I'm not. And it proved today
[42:18] I caught every log and every branch up
[42:20] and down that creek. But, we had a great
[42:23] time. Uh, he can tell you stories later.
[42:25] He probably like, "Man, this guy's going
[42:27] to have to have some practice. But uh we
[42:29] had a good time. I was glad to be able
[42:31] to spend some time with him. Brother
[42:32] Thomas, you become a dear friend and I
[42:34] appreciate your friendship.
[42:36] But now we want to turn to the word and
[42:38] I'm not going to hold you very long. I
[42:39] know we have the group that's going to
[42:41] Ohio in the morning and those that are
[42:44] uh being the chaperones and driving. I
[42:46] want to say thank you from the bottom of
[42:48] my heart uh for the rental of the buses
[42:51] and allowing our church family to come
[42:52] up here and tag along and be a part of
[42:54] that. Thank you for the burden for the
[42:56] young people. this message and I pray
[42:59] that the young people you come back
[43:00] changed.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Don't just go to go, but go with an
[43:04] intent to get something from God.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; If you know there's something something
[43:09] lacking in your life, go and pray and
[43:12] trust God to complete what's lacking and
[43:15] he'll do it. Uh and us parents are going
[43:17] to be fasting. We're going to be
[43:19] praying. We're going to support you
[43:20] while you're away. And we're going to
[43:22] believe in that God's going to do exceed
[43:24] and abundantly above all that we can
[43:26] even ask or think. So we go here tonight
[43:28] Jeremiah 29:11. For I know the thoughts
[43:30] that I think toward you, sayeth the
[43:32] Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil
[43:34] to give you an expected end. Then you
[43:36] shall call upon me, and you shall go and
[43:38] pray unto me, and I will hearken unto
[43:40] you, and you shall seek me and find me,
[43:43] when you shall search for me with all
[43:45] your heart, and I will be found of you,
[43:47] sayaeth the Lord, and I will turn away
[43:48] your captivity, and I will gather you
[43:50] from all the nations and from all the
[43:52] places, whether I've driven you, sayaeth
[43:54] the Lord, and I will bring you again
[43:56] into the place whence I've caused you to
[43:58] be carried away captive. God bless you.
[44:00] You can have your seats tonight.
[44:06] I got nobody on the front row.
[44:10] What in the world happened to my hobgger
[44:12] family?
[44:14] I scared you. I apologize, guys.
[44:17] Look at them. All of them. H. Even
[44:18] Gideon's hiding back. Gideon, you were
[44:21] my buddy. We still buddies. All right.
[44:24] Good. So,
[44:26] my my my I ran them all off the front
[44:29] row. So, we're going to take this
[44:31] thought again tonight. As like I said, I
[44:33] have plenty of material here. I'm not
[44:34] sure how much we're going to go through
[44:35] tonight because I want to be very
[44:36] mindful. Some of you are getting up very
[44:38] early in the morning to drive to Ohio.
[44:40] But we want to look at this thought here
[44:42] and we find therefore I know the
[44:44] thoughts that I think toward you. And
[44:45] that word thought again is purpose and
[44:48] plan. So God knows the purpose for our
[44:50] lives. He knows the plans for our lives.
[44:52] And we dig in here a little bit into the
[44:55] church age book and we look into Samrna
[44:56] church age. Brother man will tell us
[44:58] before there was a speck of stardust
[45:01] before God was even God. God as an
[45:03] object of adoration and no one was there
[45:05] to worship him. So it was just it was
[45:08] just time only. He was potentially God.
[45:10] He said he was only known as the eternal
[45:12] spirit. But he said the bride was
[45:15] already in his mind.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; So I know I preached very fast the other
[45:20] day and may maybe more evangelistic. I
[45:22] may slow that down because I want this
[45:24] to anchor in your your soul tonight that
[45:26] you recognize where you come from.
[45:29] Because when you recognize that you're a
[45:31] bride and you come from the very mind
[45:32] and the very thoughts of God, then
[45:34] there's nothing that can uh uh destroy
[45:37] you. There's nothing that can get you
[45:39] off your walk. Young people, there's
[45:41] nothing that can sideline you. You're
[45:43] going to be straight on this word.
[45:44] You're going to continue to serve God.
[45:46] So, it's vital that we understand where
[45:48] we come from. We didn't just happen to
[45:50] be. You just didn't wasn't just born in
[45:53] Kentucky or just ended up at Elton at uh
[45:56] Eveningite Tabernacle here. You just
[45:58] didn't God didn't just place you here.
[46:00] Your family didn't just place you here.
[46:02] And God didn't just place you in that
[46:03] family. God has a purpose and a plan for
[46:06] everything and every one of our lives
[46:08] this morning. But he said he was only
[46:11] eternal spirit. But even as eternal
[46:13] spirit, the bride was already in his
[46:16] mind.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, bride. That you recognize who
[46:21] you are tonight. You were already in his
[46:23] mind. He said, "Yes, she was. She was
[46:26] existing in his thoughts. And what are
[46:28] those thoughts of God? They are eternal.
[46:31] Are they not?
[46:34] &gt;&gt; So this is in the church age. Then we go
[46:36] beyond the opening of the seven seals in
[46:39] Christ a mystery. And I want you to
[46:41] realize after the opening of the seals,
[46:43] the Bible became a new book.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Church, when God used a prophet, God, he
[46:49] was a prophet from 47 to 65. But
[46:52] something happened. He didn't even
[46:54] recognize himself as the uh Elijah
[46:57] minister or the Elijah of Malachi 4
[46:59] until 1960. Realize he evolved in his
[47:02] understanding. He evolved in his
[47:04] revelation as well as we evolve in our
[47:06] revelation. But we find here that in no
[47:10] other time, no other age that God ever
[47:12] sent a prophet that that actually went
[47:15] into the back part of God's mind
[47:18] &gt;&gt; until this age,
[47:19] &gt;&gt; until the seals were open to hear. God
[47:22] sent a prophet down after the opening of
[47:25] the seals. Now become a new book. Now a
[47:28] prophet goes into the back part of God's
[47:30] mind. And he says he said God had a
[47:33] secret mystery. He had it before the
[47:35] world began back in the back part of
[47:38] God's mind. There was something that he
[47:40] was trying and going to achieve and he
[47:43] had a motive in doing it in order to let
[47:45] himself be expressed. God was gonna have
[47:49] a bride all the way from the very back
[47:52] part of his mind. God had you in his
[47:54] thinking.
[47:57] God had you there and it's gone down
[47:59] through six church ages. But in the
[48:02] final church age with the final voice to
[48:04] the final age. God came down through a
[48:07] vindicated prophet to tell you where you
[48:09] came from.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; You just just happen to be you come from
[48:13] the very back part of God's mind.
[48:16] And God had a mystery. God had a
[48:18] purpose. God had a motive for doing that
[48:22] &gt;&gt; cuz God desired a bride.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to just dwell alone.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Won, you didn't just want to dwell
[48:31] alone.
[48:33] That's a good answer, son.
[48:37] No, we don't want to just dwell alone
[48:39] with our empty thoughts and empty house.
[48:42] Think about his house. All of eternity.
[48:45] Yeah,
[48:46] &gt;&gt; God by himself.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, and then we find, listen what the
[48:51] prophet would say in Christ the mystery.
[48:54] He says, "Now in the back part of God's
[48:56] mind, there was something he was trying
[48:58] and he was going to achieve and he had a
[49:01] motive in doing it in order to let
[49:03] himself be expressed. There wasn't even
[49:06] a moon, a star, an atom, a molecule, or
[49:08] anything. He was God. But he said he
[49:12] wasn't exactly or he exactly wasn't God
[49:14] at that time because God is an object of
[49:16] worship and there was nothing to worship
[49:18] him. So in his great mind he wanted
[49:21] these attributes to be expressed.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; In him was love.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; In him was to be a father. In him was to
[49:28] be a son. In him was to be a savior. In
[49:30] him was to be a healer. All these great
[49:33] attributes that we see already
[49:35] expressed, they were in God. But notice
[49:39] the the Baptist didn't have this
[49:41] understanding. And some of us, we may
[49:43] have not come out of the Baptist, maybe
[49:44] it's Pentecostal. Even the Pentecostals
[49:47] in the, you know, early beginnings, the
[49:49] 1900s, even to, you know, in the the era
[49:52] that brother Brandon was here in the
[49:53] 40s, 50s, and 60s, it wasn't to that
[49:56] group.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; It went over their head. They didn't
[50:01] realize. They just thought, well, you
[50:03] know, he was a great healer. you know,
[50:05] as long as he was healing the sick, as
[50:07] long as he was, you know, had the sign
[50:10] in the hand. But when the ministry
[50:12] turned from the first pool and the
[50:13] second pool and it moved into the third
[50:15] pool, which is the opening of the word,
[50:18] they begin to deject the prophet. They
[50:21] begin to reject his ministry because it
[50:23] wasn't for them. It was for you and I
[50:26] tonight. It was for that elect of God.
[50:29] And only the elect of God will receive
[50:32] the vindication of this message.
[50:37] It's not for everybody.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; So look around at your neighbor. Say,
[50:41] "I'm not just anybody. I'm somebody
[50:44] tonight. I'm the bride of Jesus Christ."
[50:48] &gt;&gt; That devil may have been beating you
[50:49] around the st on your feelings. Well, I
[50:51] don't feel like I'm saved. I don't feel
[50:53] like I'm this. I don't feel like I'm
[50:54] that. It ain't based on your feelings.
[50:56] It's based on what the word declares you
[50:58] are.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And it shows you in the back part of
[51:01] God's mind, you were there.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; What did he tell Job? Job, where were
[51:07] you?
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Where were you before all the calamity?
[51:11] Where were you before you lost your
[51:12] children? Where were you before you lost
[51:14] your wealth? Where were you before your
[51:15] wife turned against you?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Where were you, Job, before the sons of
[51:19] God shouted?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Job, you were in my thinking.
[51:25] Job, you were in my thoughts.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; So God knew that Job was going to come
[51:30] through. Why else would God tell the the
[51:33] devil, "Have you considered my servant
[51:36] Job?" He already knew where Job came
[51:38] from. He already saw Job overcoming. He
[51:42] already saw Job in victory. And if he
[51:44] saw Job in that position, what about his
[51:47] bride tonight in the same position as an
[51:50] overcomer as a devil defeater? church.
[51:53] That's you tonight.
[51:55] God sees you victorious.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; But notice, let's keep going. I said I
[52:01] was going to try to slow down. The word
[52:03] is too rich, brother Tommy.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. So the first thing
[52:09] he made was angels.
[52:12] And then they worshiped him and that
[52:13] made him God. And when angels began to
[52:15] worship him, that was before there was a
[52:18] molecule in the earth. Before he ever
[52:21] blew the solar systems off his hand, he
[52:23] created angels.
[52:25] But listen how a prophet begins to try
[52:28] to tie all this together. There was
[52:30] nothing. It was darkness. There wasn't
[52:32] no sun, no moon, no stars, no nothing.
[52:35] Then he was God. See, God had a purpose
[52:40] and a hidden mystery.
[52:43] Notice again on this hidden mystery. It
[52:47] was hidden down through church ages.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; God had hid it
[52:54] down through six church ages. But in the
[52:57] seventh, in the final church age, not
[53:00] through reformers Martin Luther, John
[53:03] Wesley, but through a vindicated prophet
[53:06] would he be to unveil
[53:09] the mind of God. unveil God to a people
[53:14] but also unveil to the people who they
[53:17] are and where they came from.
[53:20] So, brother B says, he goes, "So, you
[53:22] can see here basically in the beginning,
[53:25] the very thought that God had in his
[53:27] mind, he hid it from those scholars."
[53:31] The very thought that he had, well, you
[53:33] you know, you talk to a Baptist
[53:35] theologian or a Methodist theologian or
[53:37] a Pentecostal theologian, and if you're
[53:39] not careful, they'll tie you up on
[53:40] theology. But we're not talking about
[53:42] theology this evening. We're talking
[53:45] about the word. And God hid the very
[53:48] secret from the the from the scholars,
[53:51] from the theologians. And he says just a
[53:54] number, a selected predestinated number,
[53:58] a predestinated people was the only ones
[54:01] that heard it.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody should say amen to that. If
[54:05] you heard that eagle scream, if you
[54:07] heard from your theophony, it shows you
[54:10] this evening that you are that selected
[54:13] predestinated person. cuz not
[54:15] everybody's hearing this call. Not
[54:17] everybody's hearing this message, but
[54:19] only the selected elected of God are
[54:22] hearing it.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; So otherwise, we can say that it was it
[54:27] wasn't sent to all Christianom. It was
[54:30] only sent for a special class.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Not the poor.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody say hallelujah.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Not the rich.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; I know we ain't got very many rich here,
[54:42] but that's all right. We can say
[54:44] hallelujah. Anyway,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; it's not based on that kind of class
[54:48] system, but a special class of people.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; See, it was only and it is only for the
[54:58] elected predestinated people. The bride
[55:01] are the only ones, church, that are
[55:03] going in the rapture.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Now, that sounds kind of harsh, doesn't
[55:08] it?
[55:10] You mean all the Christians out there
[55:12] and all the denominational systems, all
[55:15] God's going to call people out of that.
[55:17] But I want you to understand the bride
[55:19] is a selected people, an elected people.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; They're the ones that's going to be
[55:25] dwelling with him in his kingdom.
[55:28] They're not going to be on the outside
[55:30] of the city. They're not going to be
[55:31] servants. There's going to be those
[55:33] that'll be there. But listen what the
[55:34] prophet says in the rapture message. He
[55:35] said, "This rapture that we're talking
[55:37] about is only for the bride."
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I figure y'all get a little bit
[55:43] more excited than that.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Only for the bride. Remember the Bible
[55:47] said the rest of the dead live not for a
[55:49] thousand years. This great rapture, if
[55:52] there's not a rapture, friends, and
[55:53] where are we at? What are we going to
[55:55] do? He says, "What age are we living in?
[55:57] What promise do we have?" There is going
[55:59] to be a rapture. The Bible says there
[56:01] will be. And it will only be for the
[56:04] elected. the elected lady, the bride in
[56:06] this day that's pulled out of the
[56:08] church.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; See, the very word church means called
[56:12] out and Moses called a nation out of a
[56:14] nation. And the Holy Spirit is calling a
[56:16] bride out of a church.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't be yolked up in the
[56:21] nominal systems because he's calling a
[56:23] bride, a bride coming out of call, the
[56:25] bride tree. He says rather, he said, "Is
[56:28] the ones that's going to be in the
[56:29] rapture alone, nothing but the bride,
[56:31] the elected ones, fornown by God from
[56:34] the beginning, the father's spiritual
[56:37] genes."
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my, that's rich.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; See, what was once in God's great
[56:44] secret, great mystery, secret in his
[56:46] mind is now put in the hearts of the
[56:49] believer.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is church. This is wonderful.
[56:55] what was once in the very back part of
[56:58] God's mind.
[57:01] Notice it wasn't revealed in to Paul in
[57:03] Paul's era in his age in Ephesian age.
[57:06] It wasn't revealed in Martin and Luther
[57:08] and Columba and Iranius and Wesley. But
[57:11] no, he waited till the final age. He
[57:15] waited down to the final age to be a
[57:17] final people at the end of the gentile
[57:19] dispensation. Will he begin? Now notice,
[57:22] he called a bride out of all those ages.
[57:25] But it's in this age when we look back
[57:27] and we've seen that there's been
[57:28] previous ages, but there's not coming an
[57:31] eighth age. We're not going for another
[57:33] age and there's not another messenger.
[57:35] But in this age, God's in a vindicated
[57:38] voice to share to you, to express to you
[57:41] the eternal thoughts of God. God done it
[57:45] for you in this age and no other age.
[57:50] No other age tapped into the very
[57:52] secrets of God's mind.
[57:55] Hallelujah. What a people we are.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; What a privilege we have young people to
[58:02] serve God.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; But God's great mystery.
[58:10] What that eternal God had as a mystery
[58:12] has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ.
[58:16] Then given right down to his church.
[58:19] See here it was he put it in the heart
[58:22] of the believer that is the body of
[58:24] Christ. What was once in God's great
[58:26] secret in his mind before the foundation
[58:28] of the world is now made manifest.
[58:32] Remember my my title is the eternal
[58:35] thoughts of God materialized
[58:38] or manifested in a word bride.
[58:42] You are that word bride.
[58:45] You are the manifestation of the eternal
[58:48] thoughts of God.
[58:50] So God's great mystery, what the eternal
[58:53] God had as a mystery has now been
[58:55] unfolded in Jesus then given right down
[58:58] to his church. What was once in God's
[59:01] mind is now in the body of Christ. Jesus
[59:03] making love to his church's bride,
[59:05] whispering secrets to her. So, he's
[59:09] telling her things that he's not going
[59:10] to share with anybody else. Because
[59:12] there's things that I tell my wife, I
[59:14] don't tell anybody else because of our
[59:17] relationship, because of our union
[59:19] together, because of our marriage vows.
[59:22] And I'm telling you, it's the same thing
[59:24] with God. He's not just sharing this
[59:26] with anybody else.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; It's only to those that he has espoused
[59:31] himself to, that he's made a vow to, the
[59:34] one that was in the back part of his
[59:36] mind. Now he says, "Now you know how you
[59:38] tell your wife things, John."
[59:42] Yeah, I got him.
[59:45] You know, this is your prophet. So, let
[59:47] me just quote what the prophet said. You
[59:49] know how you tell your wife things, you
[59:51] know, the little girl you're you're
[59:52] going to marry, you love her so much,
[59:55] you just tell her the secrets and get
[59:56] her up next to you and you love her and
[59:58] you you tell everything. You know how
[1:00:00] that is, Troy.
[1:00:02] how it was when you and Robin my wasn't
[1:00:06] it nice you would just tell her things
[1:00:07] you wouldn't share it with nobody else
[1:00:10] that's what we do we and God does the
[1:00:12] same thing with us he pulls us up close
[1:00:14] in a service maybe or maybe you've had a
[1:00:17] bad day you're going through a trial
[1:00:18] situation seems to be tough and he just
[1:00:20] pulls you up a little closer and he
[1:00:22] begins to whisper secrets to you where
[1:00:24] you come from where you're going that
[1:00:27] this trial is not too big I've always
[1:00:29] been there and I'll always be there and
[1:00:31] no devil no cancer. Nothing can destroy
[1:00:33] you because why? Because you were a part
[1:00:35] of me from the very beginning. God
[1:00:37] begins to share these things. He said
[1:00:39] that's what God Christ is doing to the
[1:00:42] church. He's letting her know the
[1:00:44] secrets, just the secrets, not the
[1:00:46] flirters out there. I mean his wives.
[1:00:49] See, having the revelation of his secret
[1:00:52] made known to them by his grace. So he's
[1:00:56] not sharing these great revelations or
[1:00:59] these mystery secrets to just anybody.
[1:01:03] Young person, recognize that you're
[1:01:05] privileged
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; to have been born in a family that
[1:01:08] believes the message. You're privileged
[1:01:11] to be a part of a church that believes
[1:01:13] the message of the hour.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Now, I appreciate the denominations.
[1:01:18] They have their place. Maybe they make
[1:01:19] good moral people, and that's fine. I'd
[1:01:21] rather good moral people be out there
[1:01:23] that I'm rubbing shoulders with versus
[1:01:25] renegades and and lunatics and things
[1:01:27] like that. You know, I talked about
[1:01:28] Hillbilly Hell one of the times I was
[1:01:30] here. I'd rather have good moral people
[1:01:32] than hillbilly hells all over the world.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; But we're talking about something that
[1:01:39] far exceeds just moral character.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a revelation, an
[1:01:45] understanding of who we are and where
[1:01:47] we're headed back to.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Bam says here in the
[1:01:53] church age in the resume of the church
[1:01:55] ages. And yet it is the harvest time.
[1:02:00] There then must come upon the scene in
[1:02:02] this age those who will bring the wheat
[1:02:04] and tears to maturity. Now how many of
[1:02:07] us are tears?
[1:02:10] That's good. Well taught. Good job.
[1:02:14] That's right.
[1:02:16] Not me. I'm not a tear. The tears are
[1:02:19] already maturing. Brother Bam says very
[1:02:21] fast under corrupt teachers who turn to
[1:02:24] people from the word. But the wheat also
[1:02:27] must mature. And to her, God is sending
[1:02:30] a prophet messenger with the vindicated
[1:02:33] ministry that he might be accepted by
[1:02:36] the elect.
[1:02:38] See, he's not accepted by the masses.
[1:02:40] He's not accepted by the nenominations,
[1:02:42] but he is accepted by the elect.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; See, they will hear him as the first
[1:02:48] church heard Paul. And she will mature
[1:02:50] in the word until becoming the word
[1:02:53] bride. and the mighty works will be
[1:02:55] found in her that was always attended
[1:02:57] upon their pure word and faith.
[1:03:01] Now, brother Bramblewood goes into the
[1:03:03] Smyrna church age and if you hadn't read
[1:03:04] the church age, I know brother Brad is
[1:03:06] going through the church ages with you
[1:03:07] and I would say look be attentive to
[1:03:09] that study because it's a very vital
[1:03:10] study because it grounds you in every
[1:03:13] doctrine that we believe as message
[1:03:14] believers. The church age book is a
[1:03:17] vital book. It's a vital study. Dig in,
[1:03:20] be a part of it. If you here, if it's on
[1:03:22] a Wednesday night, don't miss Wednesday
[1:03:23] night. Be a part and and glean and
[1:03:26] understand because it wasn't Leave
[1:03:28] Bell's book. Let me just go ahead and
[1:03:29] put that out there on the shelf. It was
[1:03:30] God's God's voice to a people. God was
[1:03:34] establishing a foundation in which you,
[1:03:36] if you have a question about any
[1:03:37] doctrine that we believe, you can go
[1:03:40] back to the church age book and then you
[1:03:42] can go back where he preached to church
[1:03:44] ages prior to the book and find every
[1:03:46] doctrine that we believe.
[1:03:49] But he says now in the Smyrna church,
[1:03:51] the elect were not only the eternal
[1:03:53] thoughts of God which were to be
[1:03:54] expressed in flesh in their due season.
[1:03:57] But these same elect are called by
[1:03:59] another name. Then he goes into Romans 4
[1:04:02] and verse 16. We find that God is has
[1:04:04] given a sure promise to all of Abraham's
[1:04:07] seed. So he starts using the word seed
[1:04:12] and seed gene. Where does seeds
[1:04:15] originate? is from the male and in the
[1:04:18] seed line of the male is life. So he's
[1:04:22] saying in this seed line comes life and
[1:04:25] he goes and he says now to Abraham seeds
[1:04:27] and Paul put himself and all believers
[1:04:30] under that designation because he says
[1:04:32] Abraham who is a father of us all and he
[1:04:35] goes on not only to narrow down his
[1:04:37] definition but rather to finalize it in
[1:04:40] Galatians 3. He identified deceit
[1:04:43] singular with Jesus and counted the seed
[1:04:46] children as children of the promise and
[1:04:49] promise having to do with election or
[1:04:51] the choosing of God. Those who are the
[1:04:53] royal seed are the elect of God
[1:04:57] are the predestinated fornown of God and
[1:05:00] were in the mind of God in his thoughts.
[1:05:02] Then he goes on to say this in very
[1:05:05] plain English,
[1:05:07] in very plain language, excuse me, the
[1:05:10] true bride of Christ was in the mind of
[1:05:12] God eternally.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Though not expressed until each came
[1:05:17] forth in their designated decreed
[1:05:19] season, each member came forth and
[1:05:21] became expressed and it took it to it.
[1:05:23] It it took its place in the body. Thus,
[1:05:26] the bride is the literal spoken word
[1:05:28] seed bride. And though she is feminine
[1:05:30] in designation, she is also called the
[1:05:32] body of Christ. It is very apparent that
[1:05:34] she ought to be called that. For she was
[1:05:36] predestinated in him, came from the same
[1:05:40] source,
[1:05:42] was eternal with him, and is now
[1:05:45] manifesting God in a many membered body.
[1:05:48] Whereas once God manifested in one
[1:05:51] member, even our Lord Jesus Christ. So,
[1:05:53] as I said on Sunday, God was more. He
[1:05:57] wanted more than just Jesus Christ.
[1:06:00] He wanted more than just prophets. He
[1:06:03] wants more than just preachers.
[1:06:06] His predominant thought has always been
[1:06:09] about a bride. He wants a bride. And let
[1:06:14] me tell you, he's going to get what he
[1:06:15] wants.
[1:06:17] And to think about this, before there
[1:06:20] was ever a world, you existed.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Before God was even God, you existed.
[1:06:29] Before he ever created the first angel
[1:06:31] that worshiped him, you existed. Before
[1:06:35] he blew the solar systems and the worlds
[1:06:37] off of his hands, you existed in the
[1:06:40] mind of God. before uh Adam was created
[1:06:44] and all of creation in the book of
[1:06:46] Genesis the chapter one there before any
[1:06:48] of that ever took place. You existed
[1:06:52] and you existed before you took your
[1:06:54] first breath. You existed before you
[1:06:56] made your first mistake.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; You existed before you made that sin or
[1:07:01] did something wrong before you committed
[1:07:03] that first act. You existed in the
[1:07:05] thoughts of God.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; So let me keep going on this. Can I keep
[1:07:11] going this evening? All right, good.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "Here, we're coming to a
[1:07:14] consolation. As the eternal logos, God
[1:07:17] was manifested in the sun and in Jesus
[1:07:20] all the fullness of the godhead bi, the
[1:07:22] eternal one was the father manifest in
[1:07:23] the flesh and thereby gain heed the
[1:07:26] title of son." Let me slow that down and
[1:07:28] let you get that because it's it's
[1:07:29] imperative here. Here we are coming to a
[1:07:32] conclusion. as the eternal logos God was
[1:07:36] manifested in the son Jesus Christ and
[1:07:39] in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:07:41] godhead bodily and that eternal one was
[1:07:44] the father manifested in the flesh so
[1:07:47] it's God now manifested in the flesh of
[1:07:50] his son Jesus which Jesus is God not two
[1:07:54] different gods it's one God but Jesus is
[1:07:57] the physical manifestation of the
[1:07:59] invisible God
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; so we find here in the fullness of the
[1:08:02] godhead The eternal one was the father
[1:08:05] now manifest in the flesh and thereby
[1:08:07] gain he the title of the son. Even so we
[1:08:12] come on ELT even so we eternal in the
[1:08:15] thoughts of God in our term became the
[1:08:18] many members spoken word see manifested
[1:08:22] in flesh and those eternal thoughts are
[1:08:24] now manifest in flesh are the sons of
[1:08:28] God even as we are socalled
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; now we did not become seed by the
[1:08:34] rebirth
[1:08:36] we were seed and therefore we could be
[1:08:39] reborn. For only the elect can be reborn
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; because see we are seed and that's the
[1:08:46] reason we could be quickened because in
[1:08:48] nonseed there's nothing to quicken.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Oh man, you should just thank God that
[1:08:53] you've been quickened.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; You just receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:56] Ghost. You should just I'm not telling
[1:08:58] you just to relax and just sit on your
[1:09:00] lungs, but thank God that he you have
[1:09:02] you've been quickened by this word to
[1:09:05] where now you realize and brother Bam
[1:09:07] will go on to tell us it's not the
[1:09:09] person that comes predestinated but it's
[1:09:11] the seed that comes predestinated.
[1:09:14] So that seed was always in God's
[1:09:16] thinking.
[1:09:18] Now
[1:09:20] as I mentioned this on Sunday, if you
[1:09:22] can see this, you'll see many things. I
[1:09:25] think I think as a believer, this is one
[1:09:27] of the most important things we can see.
[1:09:31] Everybody sees a prophet.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; I mean, we've got message believers that
[1:09:36] are gung-ho on a prophet.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; We got cults out there hung up on a
[1:09:40] prophet.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, they hung up on a prophet, a
[1:09:43] prophet, a prophet, a prophet. I mean,
[1:09:44] you go to Africa and they got Christ
[1:09:47] Brandham.
[1:09:49] Christ Brandham. They think he is
[1:09:51] Christ. That's how far gone they have
[1:09:54] gone on a prophet. and on the ministry.
[1:09:55] But let me tell you, it was never about
[1:09:57] William Brandham.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; It's always been about the bride. He's
[1:10:02] coming for a body. He's coming for a
[1:10:03] multimember family. He's coming for you,
[1:10:06] church.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; So, it's imperative that you realize the
[1:10:10] whole purpose behind William Brandom's
[1:10:12] existence. The whole purpose behind
[1:10:14] Elizer coming was to find a bride for
[1:10:17] Isaac. And you are that bride. And now
[1:10:20] what we must do is water the power
[1:10:23] that's going to take us back to our
[1:10:25] bridegroom. Water this word. Water the
[1:10:28] ministry with your praise and your
[1:10:30] worship cuz it's going to be this
[1:10:32] ministry that takes you back into his
[1:10:34] presence.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; But listen, he says, "Thus the thoughts
[1:10:38] of God are eternal. They are real." So I
[1:10:42] want to look into this word eternal for
[1:10:43] a minute. And I know I'm not going to
[1:10:44] have enough time tonight to get through
[1:10:46] all this, but maybe your pastor will be
[1:10:48] gracious enough to invite me back at
[1:10:49] another time. We can dig in a little bit
[1:10:51] more. Now, that's not me trying to
[1:10:52] invite myself back, but
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; but no, I'm kidding.
[1:10:57] But look at this word eternal. Now, I
[1:10:59] brought this out on Sunday, but it means
[1:11:01] without end or beginning. Never had a
[1:11:04] beginning, never had an ending.
[1:11:07] So, we're thinking about the eternal
[1:11:08] thoughts of God.
[1:11:11] And you look at yourself, man, I'm 50
[1:11:14] years old. No, you're eternal.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Some of us, we got a new ache, a new
[1:11:20] pain. You next morning, but you're
[1:11:23] eternal.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Some of you are young. You don't know
[1:11:26] what it means to go through heartache
[1:11:28] and pain and your body begin to uh
[1:11:30] debilitate. You don't understand. But
[1:11:32] yet, you're still eternal. And we find
[1:11:35] this word eternal means no beginning and
[1:11:37] no ending.
[1:11:40] Now, I'm a Mississippi boy. That's where
[1:11:42] I'm originally from. And my Mississippi
[1:11:44] brain sometimes can't comprehend
[1:11:46] eternal.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz all we know is here and now.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; All we know is pain. All we know is
[1:11:55] suffering. All we know is, you know,
[1:11:56] there's mountain top experience, but
[1:11:58] there's a lot of valleys.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; And for some of us, there's more valleys
[1:12:02] than anything else.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; But before any of that, it was eternal.
[1:12:06] We are eternal. And we go here in 1 John
[1:12:10] 5:11. And I want to dig into this just
[1:12:11] for a little bit this evening.
[1:12:14] 1 John 5:11 says, "And this is the
[1:12:16] record." All right. This is the record
[1:12:20] that God had given to us eternal life.
[1:12:24] And this life is in his son. That word
[1:12:27] life there is Zoey.
[1:12:30] It's the logos. It's God's own life.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Notice how John will put it. And this is
[1:12:37] the record. It's not up for debate.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; The life that we have been given is the
[1:12:44] logos, God himself.
[1:12:48] Now, not not in the full manifestation,
[1:12:52] but in a partiality.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; We have a portion of God through the
[1:12:57] Holy Ghost. Notice then he goes on, he
[1:12:59] that hath the son hath life. He that
[1:13:02] hath not the son hath not life. Yeah.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; So, you might wonder, this is where when
[1:13:07] we think about eternal life, a lot of
[1:13:09] times if we're, let's just be honest, we
[1:13:11] think about eternal life, we think
[1:13:12] heaven, and we think hell, don't we?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:13:20] We think heaven. Eternal life is heaven.
[1:13:24] Yeah, but no. Listen what your prophet
[1:13:27] says about it. You might wonder now when
[1:13:29] can we use the word eternal
[1:13:33] and not use it in a way that we have
[1:13:35] been taught. So he's correcting the
[1:13:37] error of ages
[1:13:39] on the word eternal. See that is easy.
[1:13:43] Let me just break off this. When I first
[1:13:45] came to the message actually when I
[1:13:46] first gave my heart to the Lord I
[1:13:48] thought that going to hell meant you
[1:13:49] were going to it's eternal. You going to
[1:13:52] burn forever and ever and ever and ever
[1:13:53] and ever and ever and ever and ever and
[1:13:54] ever and keep on burning. And my mom,
[1:13:56] who wasn't a Christian at the time, she
[1:13:59] and I went round and round and round and
[1:14:01] round because she grew up in the
[1:14:02] message. And when I was born about two
[1:14:04] years old, she left the message, but she
[1:14:06] had enough in her still to realize that
[1:14:09] hell wasn't eternal. And we fought like
[1:14:11] cats and dogs. I said, "How in the world
[1:14:13] you going to tell me about heaven and
[1:14:15] hell when you ain't even living right?"
[1:14:17] But she was right.
[1:14:21] But I didn't know that at the time,
[1:14:22] Brother Thomas, and I dug in because I
[1:14:24] was obstinate.
[1:14:26] But listen what your prophet says about
[1:14:27] it. Now you might wonder when can we use
[1:14:30] that word eternal and not using the way
[1:14:32] that we've been taught. That is easy
[1:14:33] when it applies to God. It means without
[1:14:35] beginning or end or ever enduring and
[1:14:38] never ceasing.
[1:14:40] Women is talking about God.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; All right? And when you talk of eternal
[1:14:46] life, he goes, you have that in mind
[1:14:48] which is the life of God. This is the
[1:14:50] record that God has given to us life and
[1:14:53] the life is in his son. He that hath the
[1:14:55] son hath life. Now then, only sons of
[1:14:58] God have life eternal.
[1:15:02] Only
[1:15:04] sons of God have life eternal without
[1:15:08] beginning without ending. The kind that
[1:15:11] never had a beginning but always was.
[1:15:13] That is right. You have something in you
[1:15:16] right now that is eternal without
[1:15:18] beginning or end. It is the spirit of
[1:15:20] God. It is the part of God himself. It
[1:15:22] is the life of God.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; He goes, I can see eternity break come
[1:15:28] down in time since Eden. And when it did
[1:15:30] there, there came a line of blood all
[1:15:32] the way down upon Calvary. And from
[1:15:34] Calvary tied with this line and goes to
[1:15:37] tie the post, it goes to the top post,
[1:15:39] Jesus. And someday when he comes to
[1:15:41] claim his own, everyone that's tied to
[1:15:44] the ultimate will be raised up in
[1:15:47] eternity. Lord,
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; you say, "Why, brother John? why we're
[1:15:50] going to be raised up in eternity. Your
[1:15:52] prophet says cuz they have been in
[1:15:54] eternity all the time. That's where you
[1:15:56] were in the very beginning. And when he
[1:15:59] comes to claim his own church, you've
[1:16:01] been tied to the ultimate, the Lord
[1:16:03] Jesus Christ. And then when he gives up
[1:16:05] begin to pull on that bloodline, he's
[1:16:07] going to pull you right back up into
[1:16:09] eternity again.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; He says they were predestinated in
[1:16:14] eternity. They are part of God. They
[1:16:16] were in his thing at the beginning. And
[1:16:18] when that big rope is pulled or the line
[1:16:21] of blood, that token I was speaking of,
[1:16:23] when it comes up from the earth,
[1:16:24] everyone that was included in that blood
[1:16:27] will be dropped right back into eternity
[1:16:29] again.
[1:16:32] We come from God, we're going back to
[1:16:34] God. We came from eternity. We're going
[1:16:37] back to eternity. Only thing is, we
[1:16:39] bypassed our theophony and we come down
[1:16:42] to be tested. But let me tell you, we're
[1:16:44] going back to a word body. The same way
[1:16:46] Melazdc came in a word body, the same
[1:16:49] way Jesus Christ came in a word body,
[1:16:51] we're going back to a word body
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; to be the materialized thoughts of God.
[1:16:58] Listen now, if a sinner is going to hell
[1:17:03] and then suffer the same as you and I
[1:17:06] are going to going to heaven and enjoy
[1:17:08] heaven, then he has the same kind of
[1:17:10] life that we have already. So if we say
[1:17:12] that a sinner is going to h going to
[1:17:14] hell he's going to he's going to suffer
[1:17:16] as long as we're enjoying the benefits
[1:17:18] of heaven. He said then we saying he has
[1:17:20] the same life as us. Brother Bam goes on
[1:17:23] he says now then right he goes then
[1:17:26] there might be those who say eternal
[1:17:28] life signifies the welfare of the
[1:17:29] children of God. It is their welfare and
[1:17:32] their enjoyment that is at stake. On the
[1:17:34] other hand, the sinner goes to his
[1:17:36] punishment so that he can reduce the
[1:17:38] second death to a matter of punishment
[1:17:39] in place. Eternal life means heaven and
[1:17:42] eternal punishment means hell. How many
[1:17:44] of you been taught that
[1:17:48] that eternal life is heaven, heaven,
[1:17:51] heaven, heaven. And eternal punishment
[1:17:53] is hell, hell, hell. He goes, you would
[1:17:55] be surprised at the men who have been
[1:17:57] exalted as theologians that believe
[1:18:00] that. But do you know what that does? It
[1:18:02] makes eternal life a matter of geography
[1:18:04] instead of a person.
[1:18:08] Eternal life is God,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; not a location, not a geography, not
[1:18:16] heaven, not hell. It's a person. And
[1:18:19] that person is Jesus Christ. And you
[1:18:22] were in his thoughts.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; That's where you were.
[1:18:30] We say we're going to heaven. No, we're
[1:18:31] going back to the mind of God, back to
[1:18:35] eternity again. And it just so happens
[1:18:38] that our heavenly father dwells in
[1:18:40] heaven.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; But eternal life is not heaven or hell.
[1:18:44] It's God, the Lord Jesus Christ. How
[1:18:47] anyone could believe such a thing that
[1:18:49] eternal life is a matter of place is
[1:18:51] more than I know. It makes me stagger,
[1:18:53] he says, to think of it.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; So, I want to bring correction. Not that
[1:18:57] we're not taught correctly here, but
[1:18:59] because when I saw this and I read this
[1:19:01] quote, it just jumped off the page that,
[1:19:04] you know, because we think I'm going to
[1:19:05] heaven. You know, we just focus on
[1:19:06] heaven. That's eternal life. But that's
[1:19:08] not it. We're going to heaven. Yes. But
[1:19:12] eternal life is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; And we
[1:19:16] we
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; come from him.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; So we come from eternity. We're going
[1:19:22] back to eternity. Yeah.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; He said there's only one kind of eternal
[1:19:26] life. God has it. If we have God, we
[1:19:28] have eternal life and through him. So
[1:19:30] you see the word eternal or everlasting
[1:19:32] can be applied in various ways. But when
[1:19:34] it applies to God, he's being what he
[1:19:37] is, it is has it has one meaning. It's a
[1:19:40] dur it is the duration of God.
[1:19:44] You can't apply it like that to any
[1:19:45] other thing. God alone is eternal. And
[1:19:48] because he lives, we live also. Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And the Bible goes on to tell us in
[1:19:52] Revelations 21:7, "He that overcometh
[1:19:55] shall inherit all things, and I will be
[1:19:56] his God, and he shall be my son. But the
[1:19:59] fearful, unbelieving, and abominable,
[1:20:01] and the murderers, and the whoreongers,
[1:20:02] and the sorcerers, and idolattors, and
[1:20:04] the liars, they shall have their part in
[1:20:07] the lake, which burneth with fire and
[1:20:09] brimstone, which is the second death."
[1:20:10] That word part there means destiny.
[1:20:13] Brother Bram goes on to say, it means
[1:20:15] time. They're going to have their time
[1:20:18] because he's going to take he's going to
[1:20:20] take hell and he's going to throw it
[1:20:23] into the lake of fire and it's going to
[1:20:25] obliterate
[1:20:27] and those people are never going to be
[1:20:29] again.
[1:20:30] But for you and I who are the eternal
[1:20:33] thoughts of God will always be. Satan,
[1:20:36] his angels are all going to be cast into
[1:20:39] the lake of fire.
[1:20:44] Oh my
[1:20:46] So, we think about what does it mean
[1:20:48] then, brother Joe, to be redeemed
[1:20:51] and I'm going to I'm going to start
[1:20:54] wrapping this up. I'm I'm not closing,
[1:20:57] you know, because I'm at 30,000 ft. I
[1:20:59] got to lower the plane a little bit,
[1:21:01] pull back. But think about what it means
[1:21:04] to be redeemed. And brother goes in, he
[1:21:06] says, redeemed means to be brought back
[1:21:09] and put in its right position.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Its right position.
[1:21:16] to redeem anything or something that's
[1:21:18] went out or it's out of its natural
[1:21:21] place, its real place. And to redeem it
[1:21:23] is to bring it back to its place.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; So that's exactly what this message does
[1:21:30] for you and I. It brings us back to our
[1:21:34] original position.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; It places us back in sunship, fellowship
[1:21:42] with God again. it. This message gives
[1:21:45] us the reality or the revelation, let me
[1:21:47] say it that way, the revelation of where
[1:21:50] we were.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And it places us though we're not
[1:21:54] physically there, but the Bible says
[1:21:57] that we're already seated in heavenly
[1:21:59] places, which is the believer's position
[1:22:03] in Christ. And so through the message of
[1:22:06] Malachi 4th, through the vindication of
[1:22:08] a prophet ministry, what has it done? It
[1:22:11] takes us out of denominations, out of
[1:22:13] the systems of bride, out of a church
[1:22:16] and places her back in the word to where
[1:22:20] you can see I come from God. I'm going
[1:22:22] back to God.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; So I say it again, and I don't mean to
[1:22:27] harp on this, but the message is not
[1:22:29] about William Brandham.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; And this message isn't William Brandham.
[1:22:34] This message is Christ. It's the
[1:22:36] revelation of Christ to his bride.
[1:22:41] He just happened to use a seventh grade
[1:22:45] Kuckian and all of Kentucky. Hallelujah.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, Kentucky.
[1:22:53] If he was from Mississippi, I promise
[1:22:54] you I'd be kicking my heels right now.
[1:22:58] But God used the seventh grade showing
[1:23:00] you it ain't about the intellect of a
[1:23:02] man.
[1:23:04] When you think about this message, you
[1:23:06] think about the books that he read.
[1:23:10] I mean, some books that will blow your
[1:23:13] mind theological. And yet, God inspired
[1:23:16] him and gave him understanding to glean
[1:23:19] what we have need of out of those books.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; But not only that, an angel would visit
[1:23:27] him
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; and begin to reveal to him the things of
[1:23:32] God.
[1:23:33] Think about the the seven seals and what
[1:23:36] brother Brandham was going to do.
[1:23:37] Brother Brandham was going to come and
[1:23:38] preach something he had already preached
[1:23:40] what he thought the right horse rider
[1:23:42] was. And he was about to come. He was
[1:23:43] going to go out and pull his notes out
[1:23:45] from when he preached it years ago when
[1:23:46] he was there at the tabernacle. But yet
[1:23:48] before he went out, God almighty because
[1:23:51] God was mindful of you. He wasn't just
[1:23:54] mindful of a prophet. He was mindful of
[1:23:57] the people that was about to receive
[1:23:59] that word. And God could not let his
[1:24:02] prophet go out there and tell you
[1:24:04] something that wasn't right. And so Phy
[1:24:06] stopped his prophet and came down and
[1:24:09] met with him and gave him the
[1:24:12] understanding and the revelation of the
[1:24:14] first message or the first seal, the
[1:24:17] second seal, the third seal, all the way
[1:24:19] down to the seventh seal. And he opened
[1:24:21] it up and it become a new book to you
[1:24:23] and I.
[1:24:26] Oh, church. So redemption. Now, I don't
[1:24:29] know how I got off on all that, but
[1:24:31] let's go back to redemption. Means the
[1:24:32] devil put you in a pawn shop, but Jesus
[1:24:35] Christ come and taken you out.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:42] Amen. I was in a pawn shop, locked up
[1:24:44] till I was 20ome years old, but God came
[1:24:47] by,
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; let me out of that pawn shop. And listen
[1:24:50] what your prophet says about it. He
[1:24:52] said, "There's always a ransom to be
[1:24:54] paid with anything that is redeemed.
[1:24:56] Jesus was our ransom. God sent him, made
[1:24:58] him in the likeness of sinful flesh. Yet
[1:25:01] he was Emmanuel, God with us, and
[1:25:04] created a blood that dwelt within him.
[1:25:05] And he gave his blood for the redemption
[1:25:07] price to redeem us back into
[1:25:09] reconciliation to God that mui may walk
[1:25:12] with him as in the beginning.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, a prophet is placing
[1:25:18] you exactly where you need to be.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. And in the beginning when
[1:25:23] he didn't have to ship, talking about
[1:25:24] man, when man in the beginning when he
[1:25:26] didn't have to ship for himself, God
[1:25:27] provided everything he had need of. But
[1:25:29] after he got reckless and shiftless and
[1:25:31] done wrong and sin separated him from
[1:25:33] God, then he had to ship for himself.
[1:25:36] And now Jesus came to redeem this man
[1:25:39] back into the care of his hands of a
[1:25:40] loving father. Redemption brought back,
[1:25:43] replaced, put in position.
[1:25:49] If you had been in a pawn shop and you
[1:25:51] went and you redeemed it. How many's
[1:25:53] ever been to a pawn shop? How many's
[1:25:55] ever bought something from a pawn shop?
[1:25:57] There you go, Adrienne. Raise that hand
[1:25:59] up, girl. Yeah, I'm a pawn shop bookie.
[1:26:03] You go get something. You got a receipt.
[1:26:06] Listen what your prophet says. If you've
[1:26:08] been redeemed something in a pawn shop,
[1:26:10] you redeemed it. You got a receipt. How
[1:26:12] can you redeem it again? And we got
[1:26:14] people coming to service after service
[1:26:16] after service. They fall, they come back
[1:26:18] and and want to get redeemed all over
[1:26:20] again. Brother said, "It ain't redeeming
[1:26:22] and redeeming and redeeming." He said,
[1:26:24] "It's eternal redemption. You've already
[1:26:27] been redeemed. You got a ticket in your
[1:26:29] hand. You can't be redeemed again.
[1:26:32] You've already been redeemed." Young
[1:26:35] person, know that tonight when you go to
[1:26:37] camp, you've already been redeemed.
[1:26:42] Oh, I love how he says it. You're
[1:26:44] redeemed once forever.
[1:26:47] That's right. No more redeemed, redeem,
[1:26:49] redeem, eternal redemption. He that
[1:26:51] hearth my words and believeth on him
[1:26:52] that sent me has eternal life and shall
[1:26:54] never come into judgment, but has passed
[1:26:56] from death into unto life because he has
[1:26:58] believed on the only begotten son that
[1:27:01] has now has eternal life and redemption.
[1:27:03] And in Romans 8, the Bible says there is
[1:27:05] therefore now.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say now?
[1:27:10] present time, present tense. At this
[1:27:13] time, there is therefore now no
[1:27:15] condemnation, no punishment, no
[1:27:18] damnatory sentence to them which are in
[1:27:20] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:27:22] flesh but after the spirit. And that
[1:27:25] word in Jesus Christ or that phrase
[1:27:27] there means you're united in Christ. It
[1:27:30] denotes a close intimate relationship.
[1:27:34] the one he's whispering his secrets to.
[1:27:38] Not some harlot on the street, not some
[1:27:40] prostitute, not these flurers. But see,
[1:27:43] the union between Christ and his people
[1:27:45] is compared to a branch and a vine. And
[1:27:50] the branch receives strength and
[1:27:53] nourishment from the vine.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; And that's where we receive our strength
[1:27:59] and our nourishment. And the Bible tells
[1:28:01] us in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if
[1:28:04] any man is in Christ, he's a new
[1:28:05] creation.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away, and all
[1:28:10] things become new. And all things are of
[1:28:11] God, who hath reconciled us to himself
[1:28:13] by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the
[1:28:16] ministry of reconciliation.
[1:28:23] Let me try to find a place here. I can
[1:28:24] start kind of I only gone through about
[1:28:27] three pages.
[1:28:29] Romans 8:31.
[1:28:32] Romans 8:31. Let's go there.
[1:28:35] 8:31.
[1:28:42] Somebody needs to hear this tonight.
[1:28:47] Why will the overcomer go into the rims
[1:28:49] of eternal life and bliss? We start
[1:28:52] wrapping this up. I'm not going to be
[1:28:53] just a few more minutes. Why will this
[1:28:56] overcomer and we think about here and we
[1:28:58] go back to Romans 8:2. It says the law
[1:29:00] of the spirit of life is Christ Jesus
[1:29:03] had made me free from the law of sin and
[1:29:05] death. For what the law could not do in
[1:29:07] that it was weak through the flesh, God
[1:29:09] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:29:11] sinful flesh. For sin he condemned sin
[1:29:13] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[1:29:15] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[1:29:18] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:29:19] spirit. For they that are after the
[1:29:22] flesh do mind the things of the flesh,
[1:29:24] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:29:26] things of the spirit. For to be carnally
[1:29:28] minded is death, but to be spiritually
[1:29:31] minded is life and peace. Because the
[1:29:33] carnal mind is immity against God, for
[1:29:36] it is not subject to the law of God,
[1:29:38] neither indeed can be. So then they that
[1:29:40] are of the flesh cannot please God.
[1:29:44] You young people hear that? They that
[1:29:46] are of the flesh. When you start
[1:29:48] gratifying flesh, when you start
[1:29:51] catering to the flesh and to its
[1:29:53] desires, you're not pleasing God.
[1:29:57] But ye are not of the flesh, but in the
[1:29:59] spirit. If so be that the spirit of God
[1:30:02] dwell in you. If any man have not the
[1:30:04] spirit of Christ, and he is none of his.
[1:30:06] And if Christ be in you, then the body
[1:30:08] is dead because of sin, but the spirit
[1:30:10] is life because of righteousness. But if
[1:30:12] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:30:14] from the dead dwell in you, he that
[1:30:16] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:30:18] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:30:21] spirit that dwelleth in you.
[1:30:24] And brother Bam says, "Now why will this
[1:30:26] overcomer, this believer escape and go
[1:30:28] into the realms of eternal bliss?
[1:30:29] Because Jesus paid the price to ransom
[1:30:31] for all of his sin.
[1:30:33] He filled the gap of separation.
[1:30:36] We who were far off are now made nigh by
[1:30:38] the blood." And he says, "And there they
[1:30:41] will never come into condemnation. They
[1:30:42] will never be in the lake of fire. They
[1:30:44] can never be lost. For he will lose
[1:30:46] none." He says, "Not one of the redeemed
[1:30:49] will be anywhere except where Jesus is."
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:54] Now, when I was out in the Baptist
[1:30:56] church, there was a they they they they
[1:30:58] had this illustration and they use
[1:31:00] Romans, the book of Romans, and they
[1:31:02] talk about a bridge illustration because
[1:31:04] there's a gap, a big void, or we're
[1:31:06] going to call it a chasm between an
[1:31:08] eternal God and a fallen man.
[1:31:12] In the Bible, we realize that when man
[1:31:14] fell, there was no way for man to get
[1:31:16] back unless God provided or accepted a
[1:31:19] substitute. And we understand that he
[1:31:21] accepted the blood of bulls and goats.
[1:31:23] But the blood of bulls and goats could
[1:31:25] only just cover it would not annihilate,
[1:31:27] it would not completely eradicate that.
[1:31:30] And but we find but when God God was
[1:31:32] foreshadowing what he was going to do
[1:31:34] through the blood of bulls and goats, he
[1:31:36] was going to send the ransom. He was
[1:31:38] going to send a lamb that was going to
[1:31:39] be slain before the foundation of the
[1:31:41] world. And we find here that we find
[1:31:43] when this man sinned, he separated
[1:31:45] himself from God. He crossed a great big
[1:31:48] chasm, put himself on death on the other
[1:31:50] side, and he was there, and there was no
[1:31:52] way for him to get back. But he said
[1:31:54] when Jesus when he sent Jesus to pay the
[1:31:56] ransom, what did Jesus do? He didn't
[1:31:59] just bridge the chasm. He completely
[1:32:02] removed the chasm. And now man stands in
[1:32:06] perfect harmony with his maker again.
[1:32:09] Why? Because he's put him back on the
[1:32:11] other side of time, back into the mind
[1:32:14] of God.
[1:32:16] He goes, "What happens to a son? He
[1:32:18] becomes in perfect fellowship with the
[1:32:20] father again, standing on the other side
[1:32:22] of the chasm with no remembrance of sin
[1:32:24] against him." Then he goes on, "Once
[1:32:26] confessed, once confessed in the blood
[1:32:29] of Jesus Christ, it's forgotten. There's
[1:32:31] no more sin. You're free from sin.
[1:32:32] There's no sin about it. It's not
[1:32:34] because of you that you deserve it, but
[1:32:36] because of grace of God that you are."
[1:32:38] And there there's not even a chasm
[1:32:39] there. Man and God become father and
[1:32:42] son. There's no sin at all. He puts them
[1:32:44] in the sea of the bleach of forgiveness
[1:32:46] and cannot even remember them anymore.
[1:32:49] The sin once confessed is he goes in the
[1:32:52] right way. You don't even bridge the
[1:32:54] chasm. You take the chasm completely
[1:32:56] away. And God don't even never know that
[1:33:00] you sin. Why? Because he justified you.
[1:33:04] Just as if you never done it in the
[1:33:06] first place. What did he do? He took you
[1:33:09] from this side of the chasm, this side
[1:33:11] of the fall, and put you right back into
[1:33:13] the mind of God where you never sin in
[1:33:16] the first place.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Musicians, come. I'm going to end on
[1:33:21] this note right here.
[1:33:32] Let me find it.
[1:33:37] indivisible union. Listen where your
[1:33:40] prophet places you.
[1:33:43] You are standing completely justified
[1:33:50] as though you never did it at the
[1:33:52] beginning. This is my message to the
[1:33:55] church. Now,
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; as we go off the air, notice this is in
[1:34:00] November of 65. He's not going to be
[1:34:02] around but another month.
[1:34:06] He goes, "You are standing." If you're
[1:34:08] standing on God's word with God's word,
[1:34:11] every amen, every jot, every tit, he
[1:34:14] says, "Where you're standing, I'm trying
[1:34:16] to tell you, pull away from the shucks.
[1:34:18] Get out here in the wheat where you can
[1:34:20] ripe before the sun. I hear the comes
[1:34:22] coming. You're standing complete,
[1:34:24] justified, like you never did it in the
[1:34:27] first place. Hallelujah. You are the
[1:34:29] pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son
[1:34:32] of the living God. Every man and woman
[1:34:35] that's born of the spirit of God and
[1:34:37] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:34:39] believes every word of God says as
[1:34:41] though you never sinned in the first
[1:34:43] place. You are the sinless virtuous
[1:34:46] bride of Jesus Christ going back to the
[1:34:49] mind of God. You never sinned to begin
[1:34:52] with. You never worked. You were accused
[1:34:54] of by the accuser. But from the
[1:34:56] beginning, church, you're perfect,
[1:34:58] sinless, virtuous bride of the Lord
[1:35:00] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Tonight,
[1:35:05] you can't fall. You can't fail. God's
[1:35:08] already seen you overcoming tonight.
[1:35:12] You're standing completely. You never
[1:35:15] sin in the first place. God don't even
[1:35:18] know about it. Woo!
[1:35:22] Oh, what a glorious thing. You're the
[1:35:24] virtuous bride of Christ, washed in the
[1:35:26] blood of Christ. precious, virtuous,
[1:35:30] sinless son of God standing with a pure,
[1:35:33] unadulterated bride.
[1:35:36] The eternal thoughts of God
[1:35:41] materialized
[1:35:43] in a word bride.
[1:35:45] Oh, but I got imperfections. But that's
[1:35:47] fine
[1:35:48] cuz he ain't looking at this. He's
[1:35:51] looking for that seed.
[1:35:55] And because that seed is there, remember
[1:35:57] it's the seed that comes predestinated.
[1:35:59] And because that seed is there, you
[1:36:02] can't help but to hear from the papa.
[1:36:04] You can't help but hear that eagle
[1:36:05] scream. And brother Bam says, he said,
[1:36:08] "When that eagle, mama, eagle screamed
[1:36:09] out, that eagle down that chicken yard,
[1:36:11] he didn't know.
[1:36:13] He just heard something."
[1:36:16] Ah, it was a familiar voice.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Something spoke. I'm like, "Woo,
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; where'd that come from?" Never heard
[1:36:24] that before. All he was used to hear was
[1:36:26] cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck,
[1:36:27] cluck, cluck.
[1:36:30] Oh, but mama eagle screamed out a second
[1:36:32] time. A a second pull.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Flap them wings. Oh, but mama, I'm
[1:36:37] scared. All I've ever known was this
[1:36:38] chicken yard. But she screamed out one
[1:36:41] more time a third ministry through the
[1:36:44] opening of the word. And he grabbed
[1:36:45] those big wings and he begin to fly. and
[1:36:48] they begin to fly. Church, I'm here to
[1:36:50] tell you tonight in the name of the Lord
[1:36:52] Jesus Christ, flap those eagle's wings
[1:36:54] through the third pool, the opening of
[1:36:56] the word, and so into the heavenlies.
[1:36:58] We're going back to the mind of God.
[1:37:00] Take it, brother.
[1:37:02] That's where we're going, church.
[1:37:17] I enjoyed that tonight.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; That was good.
[1:37:27] Who am I
[1:37:29] that a king would lead and I fold?
[1:37:38] Who am I that he would pray? Not my will
[1:37:46] thine, Lord.
[1:37:50] Well, the answer I
[1:37:53] may never know.
[1:37:57] Why ever love me so?
[1:38:02] But to an old rugged cross he'd go for
[1:38:08] who am I?
[1:38:14] And I think of how he came so far from
[1:38:21] glory.
[1:38:26] Mary may dwell among the lonely
[1:38:31] such as I
[1:38:36] to suffer shame and such disgrace
[1:38:43] on Mount Calvary.
[1:38:45] Take my place.
[1:38:48] Then I ask myself this question.
[1:38:54] Who am I?
[1:38:59] Who am I that a king would plead and die
[1:39:07] for?
[1:39:11] Who am I that he would pray? Not my will
[1:39:18] thine for.
[1:39:22] Well, the answer I may never know
[1:39:29] why he ever loved me so.
[1:39:35] But to an old rugged cross, he'd go for
[1:39:40] who I am. Now, let's sing. Who I am.
[1:39:46] Who I am, Lord.
[1:39:52] Who I am.
[1:39:57] I can see now
[1:40:02] who I am.
[1:40:07] A part of my savior,
[1:40:12] a part of his word.
[1:40:17] It's a revelation.
[1:40:22] It's pre who I am.
[1:40:28] Oh, glorious victory.
[1:40:33] The day he set me free. me and made my
[1:40:40] heart
[1:40:43] his very throne.
[1:40:48] My life is no longer mine.
[1:40:53] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[1:40:59] Now I live
[1:41:03] to praise his name. I'm just glad to
[1:41:06] know we are who I am, Lord.
[1:41:13] Who I am.
[1:41:18] I can see now.
[1:41:23] Who I am.
[1:41:28] A part of my savior.
[1:41:32] a part of his word.
[1:41:37] It's a revelation.
[1:41:42] It's pretty vi
[1:41:47] on Calary.
[1:41:50] He died
[1:41:52] to redeem his lost bride.
[1:41:56] The king of kings
[1:42:01] became my savior.
[1:42:06] This is God's great mystery.
[1:42:11] Love expressed to me
[1:42:16] that Christ died I
[1:42:20] might be made.
[1:42:25] Who I am, Lord.
[1:42:30] Who I am.
[1:42:35] I can see now
[1:42:39] who I am.
[1:42:43] A part of my savior.
[1:42:48] A part of his word.
[1:42:53] It's a revelation.
[1:42:57] It's pre.
[1:43:01] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I
[1:43:05] know that other another part of that
[1:43:07] verse goes it's a it's a revelation.
[1:43:12] It's predestination
[1:43:17] of who I am.
[1:43:22] Amen. Maybe someday we will get the full
[1:43:26] concept of that and when we get over to
[1:43:28] glory and that just goes to something
[1:43:31] more than our finite mind, we're
[1:43:34] probably going to have us a good running
[1:43:35] fit over there. Don't you reckon? Amen.
[1:43:38] God bless each and every one of you. I
[1:43:40] certainly envy our young people. Amen.
[1:43:42] Because you get to go into having a
[1:43:44] bunch of meetings like this where the
[1:43:46] sweetness of the Holy Spirit is. I
[1:43:48] believe you're going to have a good
[1:43:49] time. How many of you young folks
[1:43:50] believe you're going to have a good
[1:43:51] time? Amen. A wonderful time in the
[1:43:54] Lord. Amen. And boy, I just pray God
[1:43:57] will do miracles. Amen. So, we're
[1:43:59] praying for you. Safe travels to you
[1:44:02] tomorrow morning early. Amen. And God
[1:44:04] bless you. Remember, Brother Brad, he's
[1:44:06] traveling back tonight. He went to
[1:44:07] brother Joseph's to minister this
[1:44:09] evening. And he also won't be
[1:44:11] ministering this Sunday because brother
[1:44:13] Joseph asked him if he would help him
[1:44:14] out this coming Sunday also. So, Lord
[1:44:17] willing, if you'll pray for me, we'll
[1:44:18] try to minister this weekend and and
[1:44:20] next next Wednesday. in and brother Brad
[1:44:22] will take the following Sunday. Okay.
[1:44:24] Amen. Everybody happy?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, as we
[1:44:28] come to the close of this service, we
[1:44:30] want to say it has been good to be in
[1:44:32] the house of the Lord, Lord, and to hear
[1:44:34] your precious word, Father, that you
[1:44:36] once again by your spirit told us your
[1:44:38] very secrets, love secrets, Father, that
[1:44:41] was hid from from the world and from
[1:44:44] peoples for generations, from times,
[1:44:46] Lord. And only in this generation, Lord,
[1:44:48] did you truly pour it out out pour it
[1:44:50] all out to let us know what you had in
[1:44:53] your mind, Lord, before there was a
[1:44:55] stardust, before there was anything,
[1:44:57] Lord. And how beautiful, our brother Job
[1:44:59] brought that out, how that when Job was
[1:45:01] going through his sufferings, through
[1:45:03] the hardest part of his trials, that God
[1:45:06] would come down and say, "Gop your loins
[1:45:08] like a man," and he would tell him,
[1:45:10] "Where was you when the sons of God
[1:45:12] shouted for joy? Where was you?" Amen.
[1:45:14] And so in the midst of all of his
[1:45:16] trials, God was telling him, I know
[1:45:18] exactly what you was going through. You
[1:45:20] was on my mind before the foundation of
[1:45:22] the world. And Lord, we're so grateful,
[1:45:24] Lord Jesus, to know that each one in
[1:45:25] here believes that same thing, that we
[1:45:28] are a part of you before the first star,
[1:45:31] before the first molecule was ever
[1:45:33] created. Lord, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:45:35] And we ask, God, that you'll just be
[1:45:37] with us and go with each one, Father,
[1:45:40] both here and those that are streaming.
[1:45:42] Lord, may you walk close to us tomorrow,
[1:45:44] Father. Lord, tomorrow, if there is a
[1:45:46] tomorrow, we ask, God, that you'd help
[1:45:48] us to walk the way that Enoch walked,
[1:45:51] Lord, because we realize one of these
[1:45:52] mornings, Father, we're not going to be
[1:45:55] because you will have taken us, Lord.
[1:45:58] And that's the hour that we're waiting
[1:45:59] for and longing for. Bless now in Jesus
[1:46:02] name. Amen. And amen.
[1:46:05] Who I am, Lord.
[1:46:10] who I am. You're dismissed in the name
[1:46:13] of the Lord.
[1:46:15] I can see now
[1:46:20] who I am.
[1:46:24] a part of my
