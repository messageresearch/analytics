that wherever they are they can have their need met lord and we just believe god just now as we lay it upon your altar god that you'll meet every need lord we commit this service to you now in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen turn your bibles if you will to the book of acts i'm gonna bring this down a little bit acts 17 and i think we'll also go to hebrews the sixth chapter hebrews six so if you want to grab that if you've got acts 17 also go over to hebrews the sixth chapter amen and then we'll go back and read acts first which will be in the 31st verse wait a minute i know y'all somebody else is looking for hebrews amen hebrews 6 and acts 17 acts 17 verse 31 because he hath appointed a day into which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he had raised from the dead amen over in hebrews 6 we'll begin with verse 17. wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of the promised immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope said which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made in high priest forever after the order of melchizedek may god it is blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen this evening for a little bit i just want to talk about assurance assurance amen that word just came to my heart and and i began to pray about what the lord wanted me to speak on and of course i thought and just let the holy spirit kind of speak to me and but it fell back again to that same word and he began to just kind of pour a few things out amen on assurance and i just take that as from the lord amen to go in this direction but assurance and on the way to church i talked to siri and asked siri what her version of assurance was i mean of course you know each and every one of us probably if you're not for sure about a word you interpret it yourself you know and you think about what you think it means you know i says well before i get in the pulpit and just tell them what i think it means i better look it up and see what the dictionary of it was amen and so it had a couple different versions it had three different interpretations but i like the last one the best and last interpretation that it gave of what assurance means is insurance specifically life insurance wow what an interpretation of assurance amen so it kind of to me it's something that's sure it's something that makes something sure kind of like a down payment somebody's dead sure they're serious about what's going to happen kind of like brother branham called earnest money perhaps you know we get the earnest of our inheritance amen something that's sure amen it's an assurance i mean they call it insurance so you know where brother branham you remember brother bam when that man came up to him i guess he was his wife's brother or somebody maybe family or friend he came up to him he asked him and he was trying to get him life insurance you know and uh you know he says well i already got insurance you know and you know you would think hey that's a little bit sneaky right there right that's just a little sneaky there and he said oh i didn't know you had insurance yeah i already got insurance you know and you know how brother man did and you know you might have thought well he didn't wasn't honest but actually according to this interpretation of assurance he was exactly right am i right assurance means insurance so yeah i got insurance you know but uh anyway so i like that because you know i think sunday people some of the people i'm not sure which one which story i was telling but i know i never finished a story sunday on one of them so i'm surprised somebody in the head you never finished that story so let's finish this one anyway but anyway so he says you know well brother brian that's awful night you know he talks about assurance he says you know yeah what kind of company what company are you with and he says well i'm with eternal life insurance well i don't believe i've ever heard of that that company you know amen blessed assurance jesus is mine no mother for taste of glory divine oh he says well that's awful nice brother random but guess what that won't put you up there in the graveyard you know and he says well i know that but it'll get me out how many likes that you're more worried about getting out then y'all are getting in else stick you in the ground somehow right but i'm worried about getting out amen but i got to thinking about the day in the hour we're living in and basically and this is something else that happened to me that i thought was really of the lord it kind of was a confirmation to me that the lord wanted me to speak on this because i wrote something down here uh about 30 seconds before david uh sang that first song amen because i thought this would be kind of my theme song tonight and i wrote down here count your blessings name them one by one 30 seconds later brother david started singing that song so i was like we must be on the right wavelength amen because i got to thinking of how how great how great it is to be a christian amen how many really enjoys being a christian i believe one place but abam says what would we do if we was it couldn't be a christian it's the greatest honor amen it's the greatest privilege upon the face of the earth to be a christian amen to be a real genuine christian when you think about everything that comes with it he meant just everything that's involved and i got to thinking about all the blessings i thought about the goodness of god i thought about speaking about the goodness of god how good he is but we know that brother bam says you know a lot of people do preach on how good god is the bible says oh taste that the lord is good how good he is and god really is good god is awesome good he's also a god of justice isn't that right sure he is amen you do wrong and so forth and they'll judge the world for all the wrong that it but he is truly for a real genuine believer that follows him with their whole heart he is an awesome god amen because there are just so many blessings that come along with being a christians and one of those blessings is that we have an assurance amen amen let me see how he talked about paul talked about it in hebrews he talked that we have fled amen for refuge in a world we know that the on the the opposite of something that's sure is something that's unsure or uncertain am i right and we're living in a world of unsure things things are not sure nothing sure the fact is that none of us even have a promise of making it out those double doors there's absolutely nothing that gives you a promise that you're going to be able to walk home tonight huh isn't that right or be in heaven one more day so life there's no assurance of being alive or staying in life here outside of god protecting you how many knows that when your card is called whatever it might be you know different ones that fell over and brother man me died right there you never know you know and so there's so many so many things that's not sure in the world and you and i live in i think one of the great blessings is and and i you know one thing that brother bam said is is that jesus christ for one thing in the way that he came and showed himself alive in our generation and the things that he did it should give us rapturing faith it gives and it gives us an assurance in other words it i i like that don't anybody any human being that doesn't like something that's sure there's just something wrong with them something that's solid amen and so i got it looking up this this this thought a little bit about uncertainty i knew the prophet had preached on it and he preached on a message called the uncertain sound and of course he went through everything but it went through everything almost even further it was nations or especially with war and and the war the things that's going on and i guess back then everybody no doubt they were pretty scared i think in 1962 was it 62 that we had such a close brush with uh with russia you know and cuba the cuba crisis you remember that called the cuba crisis man they were on the verge of a nuclear you know uh holocaust and so forth and and everybody was uh you know brother bam says you know that they were advising everybody to go in their backyard and and making you know bomb shelters and so forth and he says man you could have a a bomb go off way down in louisiana and he says you'd still die from the fallout up here so he says there's nothing sure there's you know you you don't count on that he says that's all foolishness yeah you know and he said talk about how that even war is unsure you you know you talk about how that you'll have a war if you have a war you know it won't last long he says one this long lasts about one minute because he said it it only take one person to push one button in that right and they're all watching their screens he says and when one comes over you know right rush almost another time if you go on youtube or wherever and you look at all the times that we came almost and how close we came to a complete wipeout amen it was amazing how many times maybe we would send up a rocket or whatever we were doing the test and we didn't let them know and it was coming their way you know they were like a red alert get ready get ready if that thing comes too far we're standing and come to find out hey sorry we didn't let you guys know oh thanks you know how many knows that if god chose to end it all he wouldn't take a whole lot that's a little misunderstanding he you know it's him that holds me back i mean knows that but he says they're watching those screens and he says one of these days you know you know just one person amen doing that and that whole thing will be going up in smoke because there's not you know the kind of war they have nowadays won't last won't last very long amen but i like this he says but the church don't have to worry you ain't going to be here then anyhow that's one thing sure amen that's right you're not concerned because of the certainty of god's promise to us how many knows that he's not going to destroy the righteous with the wicked amen he talked about now listen what he says we're living in a day of great uncertainty we all know that the day of uncertainty and the time of uncertainty and i guarantee you i mean you and i are probably seeing more of that than what even he did amen and we'll in the next years ahead of us we'll probably see things that we never heard of or thought of it's very uncertain i watched the news just a little bit today and they said they have more military in washington because of this vote that's taken place i think it was today uh more military in washington dc than all of afghanistan and a couple of those countries in our own capital just to keep order because they're afraid of what might happen uncertainty we've never had that before we never had to do that before what's going to happen next total uncertainty in the world but i get to thinking about how that a believer and where you stand how many knows that jesus talked about a rock and and somebody building their house upon a rock and another one building it on sand and that right and if you build it upon a rock you're building it upon certainty and paul here talking about how that we have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that's set fast and this hope that we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast i mean please say something that's sure i like that and steadfast and that which entereth within the veil amen that assurance is something in here people that live by the outside boy they get pulled here and pulled there and everywhere you got to have the anchor down in here you got to have that assurance down here amen praise the lord so notice what he says again so he says we all know that the day of uncertainty time of uncertainty i don't believe that there ever was a time since the time of the garden of eden i do not believe there's ever time or a space of time with so much uncertainty as today because there's not even one hope left of the natural world today amen praise the lord so uncertainty all around us he talked about uh you know about national life now there's no certainty there he talked about home life in that right he talked about marriages and how uncertain marriages is people that you never thought would get a divorce get divorced amen and a lot of times you find that it's as much women a lot of times as it is men amen but what you just ain't no certainty you know that and so church life he talked about church life and how uncertain church life is amen people just put their name on the book but yet the bible talks about they're coming that day and they'll say you know have one on this that or the other amen and they'll be disappointed it's an age of deception amen oh my praise the lord so we're blessed how many we believe that we're very blessed people people have all kinds of things people have a lot people have this people have that there's rich people and so forth but listen the problem of god he says you know when he was in that little trailer and all roberts billy graham and all of them had all of these multi-million programs and here he had a little typewriter in the back of his trailer and he says boy what do i have i don't have my heart i don't have nothing and the voice spoke back he what did the voice say to brother madam the same thing that you'll read in the genesis there where god told abraham he says you know i am your portion i was looking at brother bam somewhere where he talked about how that you know he says don't you can't trust riches and so forth he says really the only person that's really rich is somebody that has christ that's the only person that's rich is somebody that has the lord jesus christ everything else is uncertain so he told him look i am your portion that's why i say i believe that if you have him oh my you ought to be the happiest person in the world to know that you are his that you belong to god let the world have what it wants as long as you have god you have that assurance for one thing how many knows jesus says you know that uh the gentiles they seek after the clothes that they wear the food that they eat he says but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you how many knows he's our caretaker he knows oh i like that i like when when god does those little things that he shows you that hey i'm right there i'm with you because i don't know you let you can see whatever you want to see but i want to see jesus because jesus said the world ain't going to see me no more but you will see me i want this don't you want to have the assurance that i know that god is working in my life i can see him in myself i can see him in others i can see him in other people i see jesus working it's amazing just coming out to preach a sermon like this and and i think boy i don't want to ask brother david maybe to sing that song amen count your blessings you know and there you come the first song the county blessing i'm saying thank you lord how many knows he knows all about he cares about every detail about us amen praise the lord god is good full of assurance we have assurance i like that amen the psalm says it this way he said blessed blessed assurance jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine oh my if i'm not wrong my memory serves me right he talked he brotherham told us that heaven is consist gonna consistent of a church service with the atmosphere of the holy ghost only many more times isn't that right so our church service in the atmosphere of the holy ghost that's foretaste of glory divine amen i remember in one of my dreams i've had of course i dream every night but i've had i've had several dreams of actually going in the rapture and i was just preaching away and i was saying you know this is what the prophet said it's like a service just magnified many more times and i was going and i was leaving and i was going up and i was flying through the air and i was just rejoicing and praising god leaving the world just rejoicing and preaching and saying that's exactly the truth that's just how it is hallelujah huh because that's truly what heaven is jesus is mine blessed assurance jesus is mine because the holy ghost jesus in you is a foretaste of glory divine let me believe that that sweetness of the holy spirit amen that peace that passes understanding it is a foretaste of glory to mine what a blessed thing no wonder they could write a song about it about this blessed assurance knowing that jesus is mine amen that i don't have to be on the shifting's hands let me just go one mother one other thing that just comes to mind it means something else that i know and that is that the greatest miracle that jesus can do for a person is to forgive them of their sins to change their nature to make a man that's a drunk and a brawler and a beater of his wife and not mistreating his children everything else to change in that man to be a nice and sweet and loving and kind to forgive him of his sin to change his name that's the greatest miracle the change in nature to save us all amen so oh my we could sit here tonight we could think about how blessed we are amen because of all the blessings that he bestowed upon us how good god is and what kind of an assurance that we have in the midst of a rocking world i mean it's like it would be like the earth just rumbling below us and we just having our faith in god amen when i thought about this sermon i thought about daniel i thought about the three hebrew children amen when daniel no doubt when you i can just imagine this is just an imagination but i can imagine daniel being escorted over to the lions then amen and as he was amen going towards that thou lions then he could have been singing exxon on christ the solid rock i stand of other ground is sinking sand why because he had the assurance that he was in god's care where he was on a solid rock that ain't no line gonna scare it out of him though he goes right to the door of death and perhaps into death it's not going to me move him because he's got that blessed assurance jesus was his he was prayed up he had that assurance that unmovable assurance you know age when everything is moving the believer should not be moving but closer to the lord amen amen only moving closer to the lord i thought about the three hebrew children amen once again my imagination takes me to three hebrew children and as they was going along huh amen as they was being escorted up to the great fire perhaps they had turned over to the soldiers and said hey soldiers i hope you have fire insurance huh because we got blessed assurance jesus he'll take care of us i hope you got assurance huh we could say that to this whole world i hope you got assurance because there's a great fall right up ahead and if you don't have that assurance huh praise the lord there is a there is a there is a cable let's just say that there's a cable stretched across the niagara falls and you can't reach it all right nobody can reach it from the water but everybody's fixing the head towers that niagara falls but the christian has a special harness on all right and they have a little uh a cable that sticks straight up about six foot and on that six foot there's a hook on it and that's just about exactly the height that that cable is and just before we go into that tribulation period we're promised to get picked up amen we've got a special look we've got the assurance that we don't have to worry about the bombs we don't have to worry about amen the judgment why because we've got assurance blessed assurance amen paul said our assurance is that jesus rose from the dead he said to god listen where if he hath given assurance unto all men in that he has raised him from the dead praise be to god hallelujah all right now let's look at something else as we think about of course the believer is not supposed to go through the tribulation period isn't that right amen but in the future home brother bam said that this fire that's coming this fire that he describes as both supernatural and natural fire it's going to destroy everything malachi 4 talk about how did everything finally get burned is that right the whole world is going to get burnt all that wickedly shall be ashes under the soles of your feet but abandonment future home says every sinner all sin all devils all evil everything that's evil everything that's wicked is going to be burnt that right and listen and if that evil is in you guess what's going to happen you're going to get burned if there's evil in you because all the wicked shall be burned how many know that all the wicked shall be burned all the wicked all the unbelievers all them that do iniquity amen they'll all be burned there's a promise of that amen but you know for the believer how many know that the fire is here tonight the holy ghost is here tonight he's in services he's in wherever you are whenever you're driving down the road and the holy speaker spirit speaks to your heart and says look you know you're not doing what you ought to do you're not doing this right or you do whatever it is huh that's the holy spirit trying to burn the evil out of our hearts because how many believe that we don't want any evil in our heart we don't want no wickedness in our heart because it's all going to burn praise be to god amen i love that story of back in the western days of how this big wagon train was going out west and there was in this open prairie of this beautiful field of grass all this dead grass i believe is what i'm i'm believing that it is it was all a bunch of dead grass and it was going through this grass and all of a sudden the prairie fire came up and that fire was coming that way and can you imagine the flames just a billowing everywhere as far as you could see you couldn't go back and go back to the river you you couldn't go nowhere huh and somebody was wise you know right and they begin to light a little bit of that prairie fire right here no doubt a lot of the men with their shovels and everything controlled that fire right and just made it spread out spread out and as it spread out they didn't let it burn this way just let it burn that way let it burn that way and they got all of their wagons in there huh it was already burnt and that little girl i believe it was was just going up oh we're gonna die we're gonna burn we're gonna die and the little boy says what fear not little sister fear not don't worry because we're standing where the fire has already been now he knows the feeling the feeling when the fire was coming was like oh oh my it's horrible it's terrible isn't that right but the feeling that they had after they were in it they were like don't worry don't have no fear you have the assurance that you're not gonna burn it can't burn here anymore because the fire's already been here amen that's the way it is with the center a sinner or a backslider that still has sin in his heart he knows he's not right we've got yeah you got something to be afraid of you got something to worry about because you're you know something in there and still's gonna have to get burned out of there you're still in danger but after the fire the holy ghost comes in there and cleans that out he quick cleans out malice he cleans out bitterness he cleans out hatred and variants and amen and lust and whatever it might be burns all of that out it's all gone then you can have that comfort hey i ain't got to worry about anything because i'm standing where that fire has already been there's no wickedness in vineyard to burn amen how many wants to be there lord let that be me let there be where there is no wickedness in me to burn i have the assurance that i don't have to be in the fire because i'm where the fire has already been praise be to god amen hallelujah i love the lord thank you all for praying for me amen because i just i just want to be a blessing to y'all amen and say what god wants me to say preach what god wants me to preach and i hope it does you good amen because i'll tell you what when this lord shows me that stuff amen well amen god is good and i just love the lord and i know you do too i'm glad to be a christian i'm glad that i'm not a muslim i'm glad i'm not a buddha or any other religion think about this going on streaming any other religion let me get a little more detailed i'm glad i'm not a baptist or a methodist or amish or mennonite or pentecostal or catholic or any of those religions i'm glad i'm not because they don't have an assurance a prophet of god vindicated by god after he would say and declare them just to be lodges huh just a place to meet just the lodge declared them dead declare them to have put christ outside isn't that right and then after he said no things jesus himself would come down and to begin to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart just like he did with the woman at the well did the very sign of the messiah never stop vindicating the prophet of huh said they're a bunch of harlots and prostitutes claiming to be married to christ but they still want their man-made creeds and dogmas huh so i'm glad i'm not because i want to tell you something that's not really sure is it after a prophet of god comes and declares that there's not a lot of assurance in that not a lot of assurance at all we never think about this how about the when he was in india i believe it was and and and he challenged the sikhs the chains and all of those religions is that right said any of your gods and can come up here and open this blind man's eyes then your religion's right and i'll follow your religion what a challenge come on folks listen what would we have done if we'd have been the days of elijah when he challenged those 400 prophets of baal remember that and said let the god who is god come down and consume the sacrifice isn't that right and they cut themselves to 400 prophets they did this and they cut themselves they cried and they screamed and everything else and the prophet says you know maybe he went on vacation i'm sorry but it sounds just a little sarcastic almost a little smart but that's okay god gets that way sometime maybe he's on vacation y'all maybe you need to scream a little louder huh maybe you don't know this oh they cut themselves and screamed and hollered and still no fire came down huh the same way we got pretty excited listen evening like tabernacle but when i tell you the story of the same thing happening today i mean it believes you ought to excite us a little bit it ought to make us like that's right praise be to god i'm glad that i'm following the religion that was proven right i have an assurance to know that it is sponsored by jesus himself how many beliefs of religion that we follow is sponsored by jesus himself it was thus saith the lord it is thus saith the lord and we have an assurance that we're going to meet the lord in the air now all those sikhs all those chains all of those buddha all of those religions amen they couldn't come up there they wouldn't come up there and try to open that blind man's eyes because they knew they couldn't do it and the prophet of god couldn't do it but he had seen a vision from the lord jesus christ that jesus would do it now the lord jesus christ who i represent will open his blind man's eyes because the scripture said the works that i do shall they do also isn't that right and greater works than these tell you do amen what did he say if he don't open this blind man's eyes i'm a false prophet you need to put it on my back and run me out of the country huh i'll say this tonight maybe brother banham should have said and if you're wrong then you need to stop your religion huh you need to quit what you're doing and start following this jesus if i'm willing to follow yours you need to be willing and how many knows 30 000 raw heathens gave their lives to the lord in one meeting 30 000 converts 10 times the size of acts 2 pentecost 10 times greater greater than d shall you do thirty thousand not three thousand amen how many glad for the blessed assurance jesus is mine i know what a fortress of glory divine that's why brother branham says you know with the signs the wonders of indication the proof that jesus is alive and we're following the right path you ought to be the happiest people upon the face of the earth happy means blessed see so you are how many believes you are the most blessed people upon the face of the earth you sitting here tonight you streaming i believe the message in the hour you are the most blessed people upon the face of the earth the most blessed and we got to take it a whole lot more serious than what we do amen praise be to god what a blessed assurance that jesus is alive as i was studying this message the thought comes to my mind well now what if brother branham would have just got up here like oral roberts billy graham uh and preached the gospel at altar calls really nobody get healed or anything perhaps just sinners give their heart to the lord no signs no wonders no discernment it had been a little different wouldn't it yeah while it would have been good while it would have been right as long as it's according to the word because that's the gospel preach the gospel to every all nations in it right but jesus did a little bit more than that not that he had to but he did just to get the people to believe he would then come down and vindicate and prove it with signs and wonders because if you look at acts i believe it was in acts or matthew 28 and it says they went out preaching with signs following those signs followed then jesus himself would come down and improve it and show that it was absolutely the truth not just because it was according to the word amen that's good it has to be but then god would come and vindicate it that make the difference between all roberts billy graham and brother brennan hello i would come down and vindicate his prophet amen praise the lord that's brothers and sisters i'm so thankful for that assurance you know let me say this to all believers all believers all message followers and i didn't have the time but if you know the message i'm not sure which one it is even in but remember how that brother banh said you know the earnest that actually healing is our earnest of the resurrection in other words if you have healing happening and so forth it shows you that there's a resurrection because if you cannot just heal the body he could also raise the whole body up that right so it was a sign of of that and then he also he makes a statement he says that because of the fact that you and i are longing for perfection and because of the fact that we are coming your body is coming more subject to the word of god he says that's also a sign to you right that there is a resurrection for you huh because our bodies are coming subject to the word of god i could find that i know he said it it is a earnest of your resurrection is that hey i want to follow that word i want to have the word living in me amen and you become more and more and more like that because we're ultimately going to be just like jesus to medium that's also a way that you can tell and that you can have an assurance that you're heading for the rapture because we know that anybody that's going the other way hello falling away getting cold or getting cold that you can't expect a rapture for that but somebody just getting closer and closer and closer and closer that's a really good sign that you're hitting the right way you got done this year and say you're going to be in that rapture amen let me talk to you one more group tonight we'll we'll close early tonight but listen one more group i want to talk about and that is when brandon bam went beyond the curtain of time he would be on the curtain of time and he was lifted up out of his bed about 20 feet up amen he said that's about where they are they see other dimensions not all that far away it's just about 20 feet up and he's seen millions of people and we found out that that was all these converts all those who fought follow this message all those he brought to the lord amen all of his converts millions of them is that right and they talked about how the angel says you know before you can go meet him and so forth you're going to have to be judged for what you preached as a leader you're going to have to be judged about what you have preached now i don't know about you but that would be kind of scary you'd be like wow really i'm going to have to be judged about what i have preached but brother branham for brother brandon maybe it's not scary because what did he reply back to the angel he says well is paul going to have to be judged and the angel says yep he's going to have to be judged too for what he preached and brother branham was like hallelujah well glory to god he didn't have any fear he didn't he wasn't scared he had assurance he he knew he says well then if paul goes in there because i just preached with outrage hey amen and what happened somebody tell me what happened what did the multitude out there say we're resting on that that's right they all said we're resting on that we have the assurance that what you preached was exactly according to the scripture hallelujah acts 2 38 where paul baptized them in the name of jesus christ we baptize them in the name of jesus christ amen what paul said you got to put your name on the book to make it to heaven we preach that you got to put your name on the book to make it to heaven but he didn't preach that did he no paul said by one spirit are we all baptized into one body not some name on the book amen you must be born again he had the confidence that he just preached what the prophet god what paul preached because the bible says if anybody come and preach anything else if he's an angel from heaven let him be a curse amen he preached just what paul preached predestination he preached for knowledge he preached all those things and you and i tonight when we go witness to people or talk to anybody where do we take them huh right straight to the scriptures take them to revelations where there were seven angels of god isn't that right and there's seven angels of god seven church ages we've taken the malachi for it they'll come to burn us in heaven but yet i will come and restore the faith of the children back to the fathers isn't that right everything just like the bible taught everything because amen there's no other salvation listen man people's got a salvation in their churches they got salvation you got to be honest you got to be men or not you got to be baptised you got to be this no you ain't got me none of that you got to be messaged no you've got to be in christ you got to be in christ he says that's the only salvation there's only places safety is in christ jesus amen and you and i have the assurance we're resting on that how when i if i was to live long enough to take my dying breath i'd be resting on that amen that was according to what paul taught amen how many is glad for an assurance that we already know where you go beyond that last breath you know other people they still wonder what in the world is going to happen with them anybody that don't believe this message you will probably not believe the story probably not believe that beyond this line just about 20 feet up or all the saints that have gone on before waiting and so forth they're very much alive shaking hands with one another and just waiting for the coming of the lord so you might be a spook spirit out there wandering soul i don't know what you might think that you are where you go but with this message you know where you go because god transfer transported the prophet of god over there and let him see him he came back and he looked at his body he says do i have to go back into that pest house don't make me go back there huh as a believer as a christian that's what we have the assurance that if we go by out of this body there's another body waiting for us we have that assurance we know where we're going the rest of the world doesn't know where would we be brothers and sisters if it wasn't be for the message god has sent us in this generation where we be at darkness well which church do i go to what should i believe what really is right we'd be asking those questions to your dying day you wouldn't really know but you ain't got to wonder that because we have the assurance that jesus came and he proved himself alive after two thousand years he opened he opened the deaf ears he opened he had blinded eyes i love the story of where this girl i don't know if she even had hardly had any eyeballs but and when he uh he prayed for her eyes he prayed that he she would be able to see and then he asked oh what color eyes is it that you want it even to the color of the eye hey folks that's not a man that's jesus amen that's what jesus did he came and did the very same things to prove to you and to me that he is alive amen how many believes he is alive he's real and like paul says listen whereof he has given us an assurance unto all men because that he has raised him from the dead and after 2 000 years i'll say this that he has once again proven that he's alive and he's above every religion he was he's he is above every religion and he faced every religion now a muslim if you come against the muslim faith or disadd or the other perhaps leave them but they want to kill you but brother branham openly challenge them you muslim you buddha you seek eugene all of you priests all of y'all i challenge y'all isn't that right come open if you're right come open this blind man's eyes but if the lord that i like that it wasn't making brethren god but the lord jesus christ who i represent to you that died 2000 years ago and who i show and say that he is alive and well if he'll come open that blind man's eyes how many will accept them and all hands went up in there right and what happened the right thing happened they grabbed his clothes almost stripped him almost just they wanted to touch him because those indians they they make everybody a god so the second he did that the most of them probably made him a god i just want to touch you know they go too far with it but yet he was just like peter amen wasn't so far off people are people just go in the shadow of peter and believe hey he they knew he was the man of god and believe me but get up and walk amen so i tell you this we should be happy people if you're walking with the lord if everything evil in you has been burnt out it's not there anymore let me just say this if there's any evil in your heart here and in this dreaming world if there's any evil in your heart you better get it burned out better get burnt out because listen he's not coming to get take wickedness into the kingdom amen you can't have that assurance that you're going with wickedness in your heart amen but when it's all cleaned out then you know that you have that blessed assurance jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine god bless you let's stand tonight musicians if you'll come amen appreciate everybody amen comes out on a wednesday night amen supports all those that can't stream we appreciate y'all amen but i'll tell you what we believe that we're living in a late hour and things are certainly becoming more uncertain all the time but while that's happening i believe that people are planting their foundation and their feet upon the solid rock i'm glad to be one of them aren't you that want to make sure be very sure be very sure your anchor holds and grips that's solid rock because these are shaking times and it's only going to get worse as far as this world is concerned amen let's bow our heads father god we come before you we thank you lord for the sweetness of your spirit that we have and sense in our hearts and in the congregation and father tonight we just ask god that you'll look down in every heart right now lord and father if there's one person in here that really couldn't say with all of their heart i

light shine in lord and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and to make us right before your father and the day that we're living in to give us a blessed assurance god the lord if we see the streaks in the sky if the atomic bombs go we could still say oh on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground is stinking sand knowing your prophet has said before that thing cracks will be gone
