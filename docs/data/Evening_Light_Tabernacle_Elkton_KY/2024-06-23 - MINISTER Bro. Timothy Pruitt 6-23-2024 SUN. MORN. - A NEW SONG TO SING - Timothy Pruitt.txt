[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen I've been been just thinking a little bit amen and I thought about how good it is to have friends amen you know I was sitting back there and I thought about brother brandom and how when he got up he'd always say good morning friends amen you know we just weren't made to be Hermits is that right we were made to be socialable people and to have brothers and sisters and to be around other people amen and I was just thinking how uh I'm not sure I was back there thinking of who said it I don't know we've had a minister here not so long ago and I know I had said it just before that but amen and what we have here is very special amen how many believe that having brothers and sisters having friends amen that love one another amen and cherish one another amen because there's so much so much things that can come between people ain't that right amen and so when you have things clear between people and you've got friends and amen and everything it's just very special so amen and I pray that today how many believes this is a special service this morning amen amen we come to church all the time go to church all

get everybody to pull into the right gear amen the gear of pulling on Jesus amen and and welcoming him amen and so that the holy spirit will have Liberty this morning Amen to do what he always does ain't that right set the captives free forgive sins deliver sicknesses whatever it might be because God does so many things because he's such a wonderful God so we're looking for a good time in God today and the Lord Jesus amen and we certainly don't want to be in a hurry amen and we don't want to get weary no matter how long brother Tim would go amen we want to just pull harder and I don't know maybe 3:00 we'll be here yet I don't know we just expect God to come in a special way don't we amen and so we just want under anticipation of what Jesus Christ will do through our brother Tim as we know him to be a surrendered man to God and have heard many times amen many great sermons Amen on the internet amen amen that God has used him to bring and so we just pray God will speak to every heart this morning in a special way want to thank everybody yesterday for coming thank you for bringing food thank you for your fellowship it was certainly was a good time amen a good time of

since since then I it's first time I've been able to come and uh feel like I'm at home because I didn't realize I was coming to evening light Tabernacle that's where I go to church amen so wonderful I I'm thankful to be gathered together with God's people it's always good to be with his people amen and and be assembled together with uh Believers of like Precious Faith uh never had the privilege really of meeting brother Tom and and uh but we sure appreciate the opportunity to meet him I've heard about him a lot because of our connection down in Florida where he came from and heard heard a lot of his love for the Lord and his uh love for hunting and fishing and things and and we we sure found him to be a wonderful brother and we appreciate our time together and maybe Lord teres will have more time if not we have plenty of time on the other side so amen but it's also good to be here with my wife sister Ruth and and happens to be our anniversary this weekend so it's wonderful to spend your anniversary with a lot of people amen and we just trust that we can come and be a help to you today L though and an encouragement it's our heart's desire you know I actually had that on my heart today asking the Lord I heard brother Tom speak about it at the very beginning about Lord do something special and I I believe he wants to do that this morning and and to to touch our hearts and and to encourage you today Psalms chapter 40 and verse one I waited patiently for the Lord and He inclined unto me and heard my cry and he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the myy clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings he had put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it in fear and shall trust in the Lord also Isaiah 61 and verse one says the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord ha anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the open of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord which we know that's the Year of Jubilee and the day of Vengeance of our God that com and to comfort all that mourn and to point unto them that mourn and Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heav that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified amen let's just bow our hearts and pray father we want to say how much we love you and thank you for this opportunity Lord to be with your people and we ask Lord that you just come this morning and speak to our hearts Lord you see how the enemy tried to come many times cause us to move aside or cause us to get off the path but Lord we just commit our hearts to you Lord and we ask father that you'll just come and speak and touch and move Lord and help us Lord to take another step forward Lord we pray we we give all the glory to and honor to you we thank you Lord for your love and mercy in our lives but truly where would we be if it wasn't for your grace and mercy Lord and we want to thank you for that we praise you now and thank you for all these things in Jesus name amen amen we let you be seated before I forget I like to bring you greetings uh from our church and Pastor my dad brother Tim prit said to be sure and tell you brother Tom hello and different ones amen amen God bless you today we're we're just glad to be in the same battle together on the same side amen fighting the same enemy I I think it's a it's a great Revelation when we realize our enemy is not our brother our enemy is the devil amen and even you can take it even further than that brother brandham said our greatest enemy is ourself amen and so he realiz realize that sometimes it'll help us along the way when we realize what is going on in our lives I I just had this thought on my heart and I couldn't get away from it uh preest that's here some time ago at home and a couple other places but it's something that's very dear to my heart because it's actually something the Lord would speak to me as I would sit there on the second row of the pew at my mother's um when she passed away at my mother's funeral her memorial service and he would speak these words to my heart because you know it was a time of grieving a time of of going through those say of losing your mom was not an easy thing to do and we thank you for every prayer that you prayed for that but you know uh as I was sitting there the Lord began to deal with my heart and he said you spoke these words to me that you won't always sing this song but I'm going to give you a new song to sing and I I got to thinking about actually wrote it down there as I as I was sitting there on the Pew because I just thought wow you know what does this mean and begin to study on a new song to sing and that's like that's what I'd like to preach preach to you today because you know we go through a lot of things in our lives and we go through a lot of difficulties and this life is full of difficulties someone said it like this he said if you're not in a trial you're either just come out of a trial or you're in a trial or you're about to go into another trial you know we that's just the world that we live in the things that we go through and we're all we're not any of us exempt from that every one of us has trials in our lives now I may go through things different than what you go through and you may go through and I may look at what you go through is not something very hard that would bother me but to you it's a great thing and vice versa but we all go through great things and you know it's in those moments of life that when testing where we really show who we really are that you know and I thought it was something as I was reading the scripture on Isaiah as he would begin to talk about give poting the them that mourn and Zion to giv them Beauty for Ashes and the oil of joy for mourning and the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heav I I thought that was something that he tied praise and a garment together that he would he would describe praise as a garment and I think about a garment now today when you came to church you chose to put on a certain garment you chose to put on a certain dress or a certain suit certain shirt it was a garment that you had to put on you didn't matter how much you would have begged or pleaded for it or whatever to come out of the closet you had to take it and take it and apply it to your life and I I and I think that's something that Praises also that way because it's in The Valleys of of hardships that you have to choose to praise God you don't always feel like she praising him we don't always feel like lifting our hands and lifting our voices and and praising God but amen we have to choose to put that Garment of Praise now it's easy when we're on top of the mountain you know to shout out the Praises of God and and glory to God hallelujah but it's down in those valleys that we get into many times that's when True Praise comes out that's when we can look beyond all of our hurts and all of the things that's went wrong and all the situations around us and lift up our hands and still praise the Lord you know I I I think that's something that we can learn from in the scriptures we would look to SEC or to Samuel 30 and verse one it talks about D when he came to zigg and you know and the malachit had invaded and zigg was smitten and burned with fire and they had taken the women capes and and they were you know there were not any left great or small the scripture says and David and his men came to the city and it was they found it in this condition they found their wives taken they found their sons taken they found their daughters taken and David and the people that were with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no more power to weep amen how many's ever been to that place You' I don't have any tears cry I I've been through a lot in my life and and things are so bad and things are so down and you know David's wives were taken and the scripture says David was greatly distressed for people spake of stoning him his own people his own ones that supposed to be around him encourage him they begin to turn on him and begin to talk about stoning him and and and and and to try to kill him it wasn't it wasn't something of a you know Stone and wasn't a massage it was somebody trying to kill you amen and so they were trying to kill them every because the soul of all the people was grieved and so David had a choice and David's the scripture said David encouraged himself in the Lord his God Amen he encouraged himself in the Lord is God he said bring forth the ephod and he brought it forth and David inquired the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them and he answered pursue for Thou shalt surely over take them and without fail recover all Amen brother Bram talks about he said many are becoming discouraged he said you know when we become discouraged it takes our strength from us we we want to give up we Satan likes to pull us away and we begin to think nobody else cares and nobody else understands and you know and somebody breaks our trust and we feel like we can't trust anyone anymore but we need each other amen we need each one each one around us you need the one that's next to you we need our brothers and sisters he said but we need what we need brother is not be discouraged but take courage we need to be encouraged trials may come we were never promised to be immune from them but he will give us the grace to go through them he said if the mountain is too high or too valleys too deep or too wide he'll give you enough Grace to go through it amen just don't worry but keep your eyes on Christ for he's the only one that can take you through he's the only one but if you notice it's when you're discouraged that's when the devil tries to pour it on you amen that's when he tries to pour it on you when he gets you if you can come to church and say well I don't know I I don't know if I'll ever get better or not I I've been prayed for I don't know if I've got any friends I I don't know if anyone cares see the devil is trying to pour it on you but see he said God doesn't want you frowning he wants you to be happy thank you amen God doesn't want you frowning he wants you to be happy amen turn to your neighbor and say I'm happy all right amen he wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer is quotes worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't ever be upset Mercy Jesus amen don't ever be upset said just walk in his love knowing that while you're walking with him nothing can harm you nothing can harm you everything is working for your good it doesn't look like it it doesn't feel like it it feels all hell is against me but everything is working for my good that's what the scripture says you know I I I'll say this I've told this story a lot and it's a good illustration because it it brings this point home I saw this cartoon one time of this dorky looking lamb you know walking on his back back legs and and he's he's uh you know holding holding Jesus's hand you know it's just a cartoon and over in the ditch is this old roaring line and he's he's coming out trying to act like he's going to do something the Sheep just looking at him with a kind of bewildered face like what are you doing dummy I'm with him amen amen it's time you let the devil know who you're with amen you're not in this battle alone you're not by yourself but if God be for you who can be against you God is on your side amen nothing can harm you there's neither Powers thing present things future that can separate you from him we are in him we never came by our own will but God chose you and he brought you to the place you are and if he brought you here it's his business to take care of you God Have Mercy In other words God has made you his business what he thinks about what he cares about what his his thoughts are upon and the scripture said his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his ways are greater than our ways amen when we think we got a away we're just messing up but if we can just get in God's way God's Will and God's thoughts and what he wants out of our lives and then God can come down and move Upon Our Lives so it's his business to take care of what he took to himself he said no man can pluck from me from my father's hand because he's the greatest of them all the father who takes care of you in other words who's got more power than God what kind of power have you got that's over you to take care of you amen the whole power that created the univers ierse it created the solar system it created the Earth it created everything it just blew and every Star went into his place he's watching over you that's the kind of father we have now God loves to test his people every child that comes to God must be tested trained no exceptions everyone maybe tonight you're sick just have a little child child training that's all that's going on but don't be discouraged God is on the throne God is on the throne if you're truly born of the spirit of God everything is working together for your good he's going to make everything right he promised he would he swore he would and he's got to keep his word he said why would you be any exception we are no exception I love that he the same God that kept Abraham will keep you the same one that kept Moses the same one that watched over Shem the same one that kept David the same one that watched over Daniel and the Lion's dead the same one that was with the three Hebrew children in the fire is the same one watching you over this morning his eyes on the sparrow I know he watches [Applause] me he kept Peter and Paul and all the martyrs down through the Dark Ages the same God's going to keep you he kept this test he'll keep you you so don't be discouraged we're living in a terrible hour well how am I supposed to not be discouraged and we're living in a terrible hour well let me finish the quote a terrible hour for the unbeliever but a wonderful hour for the believer we're nearing the end time when we're coming to the coming of the Blessed Lord Jesus Hallelujah amen you know God shows us in times of need what we're going through and he's there for us in those moments I'm going just going to stop here for a moment because I I I I got to tell you a little testimony of mine I was actually at brother Ron Spencer ministering sometime ago and and U I actually was before my mother's passing right just month about a month before she passed and I I was looking for answers because you know I I preach I preach Faith until the day she died and I preached it since she's died cuz Faith took her to where her faith took her to where she's at amen God knows amen as brother Bram said he said if I prayed for a thousand today and a thousand of them died I'll pray for a thousand of them tomorrow cuz I know God's word still the same that does not change anything but you know I was looking for answers and wondering God how how are you going to work this out and I'm watching her go down and down and and I'm I'm I'm just looking for a Miracles what I was looking for and I was actually at brother Ron Spencer and I was preaching on a god a God who answers and brother Brown talks about that he says go God always answers he said many times it's in an unexpected way in unexpected place at an unexpected time but he always answered he said but the thing of it is you got to recognize it's God when he does cuz sometimes it don't come like we think God's going to answer you know we think it's going to go Bloom and Thunders are going to take for and all kind of voice Timothy my servant that ain't always God does he don't always work like that but sometimes he can use a donkey got Bible for it he can use all kinds of things but you got to recognize this is God and here I'm preaching on this and I I coming down to the end of it and I actually walk around in front of brother Ron's uh pull pit and my iPad I was using went black and and cuz it shut off because I'd been away from it for a while and and and I didn't have that time a watch that would operate it or anything like that and so here I am preaching and I began to talk about the three Hebrew children how they was coming to this fire and they was getting ready to be burned and they said go ahead King do whatever you want to do but we're not going to bend or we're not going to bow to your image and and he heated it up seven times hotter and I and I begin to talk about that and I said and I began to talk about brother brandom Illustrated about how God was in heaven and the angel said hey have you been watching what's going on on Earth he said yeah I've been watching and the wormwood said well let me go and I'll send a flood and this one said let me go and I'll take a sword I I'll destroy the kingdom he said no this ain't a job for you Angels but I'm going to go [Applause] [Music] myself and I said I said brother brand talked about how he grabbed a lightning and a zigzag of light and a roll and he went right down into the fire and he came down to where they was now this is the hon gospel truth brother Ron sitting behind he saw my iPad flash on he saw it go through the apps he saw it choose a tape and he saw it push play how it did it had to be had to be God's all I can tell you amen cuz I'm sure the devil didn't put the prophet's voice on all of a sudden I heard the prophet's voice and he began to speak about and he says that's the favorite of the hymns he said he said because it describes the extreme de to the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ especially in the day we live in he said everybody else wants to make him just a man but he was more than a man he's God and he got talking about booth cber and how he wrote and how was his favorite I didn't catch it in the moment it wasn't until I got to back to the office what had happened but you know what that song was it was down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name and right as I am talking about he has come down into the fire the voice of the Prophet begins to describe it exactly come on somebody now here's how I thought I thought when my mom was healed I thought it's over with I mean my God how can he do anything more Supernatural than that she's it's over with and I watched her go right down right down right down till we put her in a grave and I'm sitting there on that second pew and he says I'm going to give you a new song to sing and I said Lord well what about her you said you was going to be in the fire he said I didn't come down for her I come down for you he said she's okay he said but I come to show you that I'm in the fire with you let me tell you how real this was I would leave there and I would go home and she would go into the hospital and she wouldn't come out she would go next time next time she would come out we would put her in the grave but you know I would went to that hospital room she hadn't talked in about 17 18 hours brother Tom she hadn't said a word wouldn't talk to nobody and because she' had those brain aneurysms and things and it messed her her cognitive skills up and she couldn't she couldn't put words in her mouth she couldn't do anything seemed like she just sat there and me and my dad walked into the ICU room began to talk to her and we have about an hour drive to that hospital so he slipped after we talked to the doctor the doctor went out and dad said I need to slip into the restroom and I couldn't wait because at this time I'm thinking God's going to heal her and I I I really believe that but he didn't brother Timothy well I don't change nothing God's still a Healer I'm not telling you this because it caused me to disbelieve him anymore I believe him more today than I ever believed him but I I be I looked at her I said Mom I got to come I want to tell you something he's come down to be in the fire with us brother Tom this is the gospel truth she turned to me and she goes down from his glory ever she ain't said nothing in 17 hours ever living story my God and savior came and sheing the whole verse and go she goes oh how I love him amen oh how I adore him she begin to lift her hands and there and I thought oh it's over with but God was showing me he's in the fire with me why you telling all this cuz I want you to know that same God that Watching Over Me Is Watching Over You he knows your discouragement he knows where you've been away and out and pulled out he knows all about that and he's in the fire with you and he's here to comfort you and to pull you to himself David returned to zigg and he find it all burnt discouraged is not enough not a good enough word to describe how he really felt Bible says as we said he wept bitter tear tears until they simply had no more power to weep for David you know it was worse he was the leader everybody looked at him and and they were consumed by grief and and there they begin to talk of stoning him and he was in distress it might have destroyed him completely except for this David encouraged himself in the Lord his God you won't ever encourage yourself in yourself you have to turn to something that's un unmovable cuz our feelings will always will always cause us more difficulties in our lives if we depend on our feelings because you don't always feel up here you don't always feel excited you don't always feel amen happy you don't always feel that we all have moments of discouragement some greater than others some longer than others some go through those valleys seem like for a long time but I'm telling you there is an end to that Valley but the end is is you turn away from what you see and you turn back to your God Amen he had a decision to make will he go deeper into the distress and deeper into the depression will he worry and allow it to make him more helpless or would he make a conscious decision I'm going to turn my eyes to the heels which cometh my help cuz my help does not come from me my Help Cometh From The Lord my help doesn't even come necessarily from those that are around me yes we need each other I'm not telling we need each other we need preachers we need people in the pews we need musicians we need everybody but our real Help Cometh From The Lord so David chose encouragement not only be encouraged but there was no one around who could or who would do that for him but he encouraged himself and I just tell you nobody cares what Jesus cares that's the first thing I want to ask people when they walk away from a church well this one hurt me that one hurt me this one did wrong well what did Jesus do we find out that our motives and objectives was really wrong for even coming to church it wasn't about Jesus anyhow was about our feelings about how we felt about if everything was perfect and right you know it help us Jesus how we get here but anyway we get in those places but the most important thing to notice is David did not encourage himself in himself but scripture said he encouraged himself in the Lord his God you see it was not about David for David had a covenant of God With God so this what David was going through that covant made it God's business and David's not the only one under a covenant but there's also another people in this day that are under a covenant with God so what you're going through is not just your problem it's also God's problem and God's looking on your behalf and willing to move for you if you'll turn back to where he is so David after after encourage himself David was able to move to the solution that God had provided you'll never get to the Sol solution of your problem unless you get your focus off your problem and get your focus on your God see discouragement does not come from the Lord it comes from our adversary the devil that's why David could encourage himself from the Lord because the Lord was the source of his solution not the source of his problem see anxiety and worry and fretting and discouragement it indicates we're walking by sight and not by faith [Music] amen I you can go do a study on this is quite amazing but if you'll just punch in in the message search deep thinker or crossing Bridges Lord have mercy you want some hide burning go go do that for a minute especially if you're one of them let us he said let us say praise be to God it's a it's in discernment he said this is what we need this is it this is the time is this the patient how do it do sister you're an awful deep thinker aren't you sister got a weary Spirit too you're always worried about things you got no business to be worried about you're nervous and upset which caused you to have acid in your blood which give you arthritis plus Lord now that's going to a doctor right there let's don't just give you something to cover up a symptom but let's go right down to the root of the issue I I hope it catch something right there it's going going to church is not about just covering up the symptom it's getting down to the issues in our lives and saying God come down and root out that root of bitterness or root out that hurt or root out that issue that I've allowed to lay there amen why cuz it's causing you to get acid in the blood and you get arthritis bring it over to the spiritual side you got arthritis and you can't hardly lift that hand no more can't hardly stomp that foot no more why cuz your hurts and your pain and your bitterness why because we've allowed to to stay up here so long come on somebody we allow it to stay right here and you know how it is I I know how it is you get something uh with a brother in the church or whoever and you got well I'm going to tell you what I'm going to go talk to that brother and you know what I'm going to tell him I'm going to tell him what I feel I'm going to say this and he going to say that he better not say that cuz if he says that I'm going to say this and we begin to think about this whole thing in our mind and we got it all planned out how it's going to be and we get over there and we begin to talk to the brother he don't even know what we're talking about most of the time it's our issues I told you the prophet of God said our worst enemy is ourself amen amen another one tons of these and ain't just women it's men too said but come lady you're a deep thinker you're sincere with all your heart but it's caused you to be a nervous person you're very nervous you're always taking other people's things thinking about that Crossing Bridges before you get to it building things that never happen and that's developed a stomach trouble for you yes that's kind how all that hits don't it just but Paul said we walk by faith and not by sight that's only two I just read you but there's tons of them go look at them about about deep thinkers or crossing Bridges it but it what was it that we walk Paul said we walk by faith not by sight and that was the source of his stability and strength when we walk by faith we're put in our confidence in God and in his word when we walk by sight we're putting our confidence in our senses amen our feelings and our understanding and then we fall prey to the devil's will that's right but when we find ourselves in discouragement we find where we've been placing our trust the answer is to put your trust back in the Lord Paul said faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God so when discouragement comes you find whether you've been walking by sight or by faith if you walk by faith you'll move right back to the scripture and let the promises of God build up the faith build up the strength listen God wants you to be encouraged therefore he gives you means to be encouraged by amen you must recognize that you don't have to stay discouraged you don't have to stay in your issues you don't have to stay in your problems it's like you brother man I'm talking about you you can't sometimes let help a bird flying over your head but you don't have to make him let him make a nest in your hair amen you you you you you can be encouraged in fact you can encourage yourself in the Lord amen you know uh I I've used this illustration before and I think I'm in a pretty safe place to use this but you know we had these barn swallows and they're I understand protected and stuff but listen they make a mess they get on the side of your house and they make all kinds of messes mud and their manure and everything dropping down and poor little bird no they're making a mess on my house you know what I do you take them out they can't come no more that's the way I look at it and I clean the mess off my house too many people allow the devil to just come in not but build [Applause] nest and next thing you know they got a hair to do about this tall I ain't talking about physically I'm talking about spiritually because they've allowed Nest to be built in their minds and all the mud and the manure and things they got to go through the devil's thinking and his wishes and what he wants and the destruction and all that stuff they're carrying it all with them but if they just grab a hold of the promises of [Applause] God I understand we got Old and New Testament here I understand it's a double barrel shotgun you heard this before ain't you brother Tommy he just that thing and knocked that devil out of the sky and say devil I'm not listening to you no more you don't belong here I never belong to you I belong to God my mind belongs to God my body belongs to God my thoughts are his I give myself to him [Applause] that's good amen you got to remember Jesus Christ has committed himself to take care of you in every situation than when the circumstances of Life pressed in on David David pressed into his benefits he gave an outline of them in Psalms 103 bless the Lord oh my soul who forget and forget not all his benefit he forgives all all our diseases he heals all our our iniquities he heals all our diseases he redeems your life from destruction he crowns you with loving kindness and Tender Mercies he satisfies your mouth with good things so that your youth is renewed like eagles I love that I I I've I've worked on that word a long time but I love it I can't get off of it when I see it who heals forgives all heals all three letters all and you put every devil in that you can put every sin you can put every sickness in three letters all I love how simple God makes it I heal all th diseases he don't give us no fine print said but this one this this one this one this one I can't do no all thy diseases all thy sins though you be though you be red carlet I can make you white as snow it doesn't matter what you been what you've been through God is all so the key is to stop giving voice to your discouragement and start giving voice to your encouragement amen stop repeating the lies of the devil and start speaking the word of God stop speaking out of fear and start speaking in faith stop talking about the problems and start talking about your God Heen brother Brandon we talk about this I think it look into the Unseen he said there's a talking to that guy that was selling TVs and come to find out the guy was talking about I don't know about all that stuff up there you know that William here you just talking to William brandom you know and he said he but he begin to tell him he said you know just like that TV he said there's we also have a sending station and a receiving station and he said well there's a throne of God that sends out a signal and he said down here hearts that can be tuned just right to receive something from that throne and that's why we come to the house of God because you know as it were back years ago some of you young people don't even know nothing about this but they used to have a radio that had a dial on it and you had to tune that baby just right to get the signal because if you didn't you got another station or you got kinds of stuff but you had to just sit there and just fiddle with it ain't like that no more you know it's push a button or whatever but then it was a little hard chip to listen to something but here this is what he's saying he said if you'll let God come into your heart and just tune it sometimes it just needs a little bit and all of a sudden the static of the world's tuned out not hearing the voices of Satan no more and his lies and he's been telling you that you ain't going to make it and the B messaging for you and it's a bunch of nonsense and brother Brand's a liar just let the voice of God the hand of God come into your your heart and just tune it just a little bit come on somebody I mean I wonder why he said if we can just tune our hearts to where everyone begins to think God is God go read that quote God is God he said every person in this building would be healed hello I don't believe that was just 50 or 60 years ago you got the wrong preacher if you believe if you think I believe that everything was 50 or 60 years ago I believe he's still the same yesterday today and forever he still heals he still delivers he still saves he still moves he still fills with the Holy Ghost he still restores families he'll put Joy back in your heart like you never had before this ain't just a hope so or maybe so or somehow maybe someday down the Road either it is today we are Sons and Daughters of God today we are his children today we are his people today we are his bride woo Hallelujah today I belong to Jesus today I am his today he is mine and he is watching over me today but we give voice too many times to our doubts and our frustrations and our fear feelings and have mercy Jesus may not be that way here at this evening light but it is at the other evening life well you know I I tell you what if I was the pastor I'd do well if God wanted you to be the pastor you'd be the pastor you know just the way it is I I'm sorry well if I was the piano player if I was this listen if God wants you to be you'll be don't worry about it I get amazed you know people have told my my father that he kept them from having a Ministry I thought my how is man greater than God really they understand what they're saying that a man can keep something from happening that's ordained of God beloney if that's so God ain't God but if God be God now brother Tom didn't even ask me to do this and he didn't ask he didn't pay me extra you know I got to say this I'm at home I at even like Tabernacle okay my dad you know gets he gets funny sometimes he said you know a lot of people want to Discount because the word is still the discerner the word still the discern thoughts and intense of the heart yes the gift that was in brother Brian gift of a prophet is not here in that capacity no more but that word is still here and spirit that angel is still here it still discerns it still moves but many said we like well he G brother Tom told him that while he was out fishing with him I guarantee you my dad said well if you want to believe that you can believe I paid him $500 extra to say it but it becomes car Things become so carnal who's the greatest who's this who's that who's got this position who's listen it ain't about carnality and human thoughts and human I don't even know why I'm going here but this is where we at it ain't about our caral carnality it's about [Applause] Christ but this is a write up that somebody sent me that's been put out I don't really know about exactly who but they say being a pastor is listed amongst the four most difficult positions in the United States because a pastor must be a preacher an example a father a husband a counselor a conference caller planner Miss Minister Visionary director Mentor friend reconciliatory etc etc etc anybody want that job Keeper of the temple every Pastor constantly confronts many things such as the pastor doesn't visit me sermons are too long my music's too loud the building's too cold one of the most difficult things in the life of a pastor is to know at some point people they love will abandon and even betray them the pastor is often the loneliest person in the congregation you may see a pastor be surrounded by people but very rarely people that are interested that that very rarely are the people only interested in the pastor's problems but they're interested in their problems and their needs and their lives he said if we have a if you have a pastor as a friend take care of them pray for them connect with the vision that God gave them support them but above all love them remember they are human and in the same way they go through the same things as you do even if you don't believe it many of them have sacrificed Comforts rest personal plans and so many things including some of their own family's needs to ATT turn attend to God's Calla value the time a pastor puts into the work and prayers he makes for everyone the burden he voluntary carries for Ministry you don't no matter how much he he'd appreciate knowing that you do Jeremiah 3:15 I will give you Shepherds according to my own heart who shall lead them in knowledge and understanding for all pastors thank you for all that you [Applause] do hey well I tell you what you could have read that on pastor's appreciation week what I'm going to tell you brother brand said Mother's Day ought to be every day Father's Day ought to be I believe we ought to appreciate our pastor every day I appreciate I think we ought to appreciate each other every day listen Co showed a lot of people real quick what it was like not to be able to get together not to be have friends not to come over for get togethers and all kinds of things it showed what you don't have very quick yeah that's right but when you do have it appreciate it what you do see it's not about us it's about him let your meditation be about the Lord and about his love and his word and his promises his goodness his works his grace his Mercy his love as you do you'll better cast your cares on the Lord with a strong confidence that he cares about everything going on in your life you know there was a time in Israel when the ark was away and it was it was captured and it was taken into captivity and and and and and and the Philistines had it for some time lot of lot you can get into that but there was a time when it was being brought back and David was dancing before the Lord why why was he dancing because the word was being restored here it was coming back to his rightful place and he knew if the word was brought back to his rightful position then God's people could be blessed again and and and so he he he began to dance he got so over and here he is just praising God and and worshiping God and you know here here it was Michael's the this Michelle the S Saul's daughter she looked through a window and and she began to make fun and despise him in their heart and here they brought the Ark of the Lord and they set it in his place in the midst of the Tabernacle and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord and and as soon as David made a end of his offering burnt offering peace offering he blessed the people and he dealt to all the people among the multitude as well as the women and the men to everyone a cake of bread good peace of Flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people departed everyone to his house but then he returned to to bless his household and Michelle the daughter of Saul came out to meet him he said how glorious was the king of Israel today who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the hands made of his servant as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself and David said unto Michelle it was before the Lord it was before the Lord which chose me before thy father before all his house to appoint me ruler of the people of the Lord of Israel therefore I pray before the Lord and I yet will yet be more V then thus and it'll be based in my own sight of that maid servants which I was spoken of of whom that I had honored therefore Michelle the daughter of Saul had no child under the day of her death now you can read on in the Bible and she actually somebody asked this question she actually had children but they was not the children of the king she was taken out of the lineage of the king and because of her her her her scorn and what d Avid was doing and he's like look look if you don't like that watch this I got a right to worship my God I I got a right to praise him I you know I got to thinking about that brother Tom we Face a lot of criticisms and things because people see our worship and see things that goes on in our churches a lot of times and they begin to wonder why does how could that be God how could that listen it ain't about you it's about me and Jesus I'm worshiping my God and I say to those people if you don't like that watch this there's going to be more healings more deliverances more prodical return more Holy Ghost more power more of the anointing more worship it's going to be more of Jesus there going to be more of God moving in our hearts why why are we like this word has returned to his position Hallelujah the word has been brought forth out of the Dark Ages of denominational system and been brought back into the hearts of men and women therefore we have a right to praise a God who set me free praise The God Who lifts me up praise The God Who broke depression off my life praise The God Who Health me I have a [Applause] right you have a right even like Tabernacle to praise the one has God been good to you has he healed you has he delivered you has he set you free has he moved your heart has he come down and saved your children then you have a right to worship him cuz the word has been brought back into his position and into his place Lord got to be careful when you get get in times like that that you don't get critical cuz you don't know you may not be criticizing brother for so and so or sister so and so you very well could be criticizing the Holy Ghost and I think we ought to take the prophet's attitude towards some of these things he said it he tells about it in in a sermon Christ tells about this several times but he talks about those sisters that got up begin to sing remember that song that story man now listen to what he says here I think there's something because you know a lot of us excuse me in my Folly for just a moment but a lot of us love the church order book and we want to but we only love certain parts of that we want right well he said 30 to 45 minutes preacher well let's just see what he done okay he said I was teaching on the second coming of Christ and I was drawing it out as best as I knew how would descend and may Ascend into glory and I was given a little intermission and they be to sing some songs while I was resting for I had about 4 and a half hours of teaching straight well anyway Hallelujah you don't ever hear anybody bringing up that quote and they were seeing I ain't going to keep Lord willing ain't going to keep you that long but they were singing a special and there was some people from Louisville some Full Gospel people and they had this special some young ladies wanted to beat some little tin cans and things and had a washboard and some Thimbles and some fingers and I played on this washboard and I guess you seen the hookup or heard it one of was going to play the piano and started playing that song there is going to be a meeting in the air the sweet sweet by and by and I said oh my little lady's turned real white around the mouth and begin to beat that piano he said I believe should have had three or four decks of keys should have played every one of them I've never seen such play in my life and the lady on the washboard hitting them Thimbles and this little blond-headed sister about so high jumped out on the floor and started dancing and I said oh my here it is why did they have to go and do that so I waited around at the people and they looked at me and I looked at them and I thought well I'm a fundamentalist you got to show me that in the Bible I thought my there's a whole lot of things us fundamentalist don't know that's in there that's all that's what he said so I looked around I thought well where did Dancing ever come from and I was sitting there in the seat of the scornful of course you know I'm quoting the prophet not saying nothing listen to this not saying nothing I was afraid to say anything cuz I was afraid they might be right and me wrong that'd be a good one to go by sometimes wouldn't it well I tell you I just ain't got no filter we'll get one [Applause] it's called a thinking man filter amen well he said I wouldn't say nothing cuz they might be right and I might be wrong what a revelation I so now isn't that terrible though right here in my Tabernacle now there's other times you can look he said they turn in the barroom a Tavern all kinds of things and he said this little lady out there just with her eyes closed just dancing first thing you know one got up to other another got up and start oh my so I begin to rehearse in my mind that in the Bible did they dance I thought when they dance what was it and dancing was spoke of pharaoh was pursuing Israel and all the enemy was drowned and Mar and picked up a tambourine and be to beat it began to dance and all the daughters of Israel followed her dancing I thought well there they had Victory and then I read where David and the Ark had been away so long and he saw it returning back and he got so happy he started dancing why he had Victory his sweetheart made fun of him laughed at him but well if you don't like that watch this and down around he went again I thought well he she sat up there and laughed him and God put a curse on her and said David thou art a man after my own heart and I thought the only thing is a matter with me I ain't got enough Victory maybe I know a lot of people say well that just ain't me well them same people get out to ball ball game and act a fool and you can read in the church age book brother brand said he said if you can do that at a ball game he said you ought to be able to do it at the house of God Amen if you can shout the Victory and and and push that's what we're doing that's what I've been hearing push amen you know what your amens are doing your praise the Lords are doing it's causing the minister to push further go a little harder amen preaching a little more until that devil is driven out of our lives and we got enough Victory to praise God for [Applause] it you say well I don't know why does brother Tommy act like he does well you just go where brother Tommy's been and see what God has done for him you'll know why he does what he does listen if my God had healed me from heart trouble like that I'd be waving a flag of Victory this morning cuz he's still God he's still the same yesterday today and [Music] forever Hallelujah [Applause] well we're just we're past that brother are we really past it what I understand is when we get on the other side you ain't heard nothing [Applause] yet I can tell you one thing when this old boy steps over and he gets a taste of that new body listen they they they tght me into getting some ice Plunge I'll be honest with you brother Troy it felt pretty good when he got out like wow man I don't feel that pain no more that feels pretty good but only last couple hours and I got up this morning it's hurting again but that new body ain't going to be like that one day I'm going to take my final step and I'm going to step into a new body you think you've heard shouting here you wait till you get over there you think you've heard teen dancing here you wait till you get over there and you see Tim PR healed of his feet problems there'll be a lot of dancing going on cuz let me tell you that man will dance he's had five surges on one foot six on another and he'll still dance all over the devil well you let him get in a heal body one time and see what's going to happen Hallelujah he said the only thing matter with me I just ain't got enough victory maybe in a few minutes something happened now this might shock you that's what he said this might shock you one place he said he said I felt my Methodist foot start tapping he said when I came to myself I was out there with that little girl dancing on the floor well I don't know just the just the thing I thought I wouldn't do I did I was never on a dance floor in my life but I guess I did it all right I sure felt awful good I had a lot of Victory after that so that would be all right then I guess see God is in music God is in music he's in art he's in his Universe he's in creatures he's in church he's he's everywhere he's present right now God is what I just wonder sometimes if you just take the shades off off our eyes till our sight can be fast enough to catch his presence in the building right now you know there's all kind of things going through this building there's telephone signals there's radio messages there's television pictures going through but if our eyes can't pick it up but if we could be a magnet post for the Holy Ghost right now then God sends a message out of glory and we pick it up that's wonderful I want to be that kind of person [Applause] just for an illustration there's a dear friend of ours we called him Grandpa he wasn't our grandpa but brother Dan Dyer from Johnson City uh we call him Grandpa Grandpa and Grandma D and there was like that to us me and my sisters and our children and things my wife and brother brother Dan had quite a sense of humor he loved sweets grandma was always on him about sweets you know and so he'd sneak around and get sweets so one night she stayed home from church and he went to church and he said he said you know it's just just just for illustration he said I was sitting over there minding my own business listening to the word of God and he said you know from way over and over that corner came one of them blizzard Spirits he said would you know it landed right on top of me he said I got before I got home I had to get me one of them blizzards and he said I ate that thing said next thing I know I had it running all over me he said why cuz I picked the thing up God if a man can get a blizzard spirit in church come on I we we can tend to pick up all kinds of things out there in the world and attitudes and situations but listen I want to come to church and pick up on what the spirit is doing and how he's moving and if he's moving in a certain way I want to move in that way however he wants to move I want to move I understand it ain't always shouting and dancing and all that it's sometimes in those Quiet Moments and those but however God chooses to move I want to be flexible enough to say yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord however it is I want to move where he moves you know in south southern us probably here which I I consider y'all the South we have a saying that goes something like this I bet he's singing a different tune now right the context of this is someone has a radical event happened in his life and because of this he acts differently because of this life altering event he no longer sings the same song because the old song doesn't apply no more because this new song is a way of saying I have a lifechanging experience with the creator of the entire universe so therefore I cannot remain the same I now sing a new song because my desires have changed personally I love the new song brother Tommy singing I didn't even really get to hear the previous song but I love the song he's singing today listen you can I Hallelujah anyhow I love it when the man just all out of the blue just text you something and of encouragement and things because he's been feeding on the right things he just sends them out and such Joy UNH uninhibited Joy why because I'm not here to lift a man up I'm just telling you what God did sometimes it's hard to see when it's right in front of your face but when you're down in Louisiana you can see it really good that God has done something I didn't even know the man he was but I love the man he is you know Moses took the people out of Egypt and he brought them scripture said he brought them out with a high hand and he brings them out and they're just shouting a victory and oh won't it be a time and all you know can you say can you imagine how they just singing as they get and all of a sudden what's that glistening up there there oh won't it be a time when we get to heaven Moses is that is that a c yeah how we going to get around it I don't know all I know is God told me to come this way well Moses you know it's real quick how somebody can turn on somebody all you got to do is read scripture I mean just like that they can flip a switch and they're ready to kill you Moses was there not any Graves out there in Egypt that we could have been buried in you brought us out here to die and they begin to murmur and complain and all see they hear the songs started switching they was singing songs of Victory and there now they're saying Moses come out here to kill us Moes come you know how it is I got to use this right here because it's too good not to use we we sing the song I am blessed I am blessed every every song Every Day I'm but qu quickly and go I'm depressed I'm depressed every day that I live I'm depressed when I wake up in the morning when I lay my head to rest I'm depressed I'm depressed I Bound for the nursing home oh who will come and go with me I'm Bound for the nursing see all kinds of things your song can change very quickly if you ain't careful he can say oh brother Tom's the best brother Tom's the best brother Tom's the best brother Tom's the worst he's the the worst it can change very quickly why does it change it depends on what you're looking at if you want to see mistakes you'll see mistakes if you want to see problems you'll see problems yeah yeah yeah it's like it's you know if you want something out of this service depend on what you're going to put into it it ain't all on a preacher you know we put it all on a preacher well he better be praying he better be studying better be applying them what about all of [Applause] us he won't the preacher wants to preach a prepared sermon for a prepared people because Jesus is to prepare place but it's going to be for a prepared people a people that's prepared to live there here they are right here right here at this and here going to see one of the greatest things ever witnessed the opening of this Red Sea and they don't even know in the next few minutes how God is going to work and they're complaining and they're fussing and they're upset and they're mad and they're thinking I'm just here to die and you know what you know what God Said first he moves and he goes between them and the Egyptians I love how he does that whole sermon and that stand our stand between all that but here he is and he tells Moses why don't you just lift rod and he begins speak and he said You shall hold your peace read the scriptures what it said You shall hold your peace now I I read that in good old southern langu Lang you need to shut your mouth because all you're doing is spewing doubt and unbelief and everything just shut your mouth if you're not going to speak and faith and speak the word of God just keep your mouth closed I'm talking about me too I ain't just talking about you matter of fact I'm talking about the egyp the Israelites I'm not talking about you keep your mouth shut unless there's something of the word that can come out and let God's word be spoke out of your lips and let it be a Word of Faith cuz he was about to take them and change their song and we can read about it they go through the they go through this and they go all the way through this Red Sea and I ain't got time but they go through on dry ground and just incredible things that took place and they get to the other side and they look back and the Egyptians said well we can do it too and here they come and the waters Clos now what I love about this is God said the Egyptians that you see today you'll see no more forever I love that because I read in my Bible that it says in the Bible that later they saw them floating in the sea well I thought they wern't going to see him no more forever as he said so it was the Egyptians that you see today they got life in their body they can still pick up a whip they can still make you a slave but today their power is ended when the next time you see them they will be dead they will be under your feet they will not have power over you but you shall have power over [Applause] them and he changed their song and we can read about it in Exodus 15:1 then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and said I'll singing to the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider has he thrown in the sea the Lord is my strength and song he has become my salvation he is my God and I will prepare oh prepared people I will prepare him a habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots and his host as he cast into the sea his chosen Champions are drowned in the Red Sea The Depths have covered them they sank as the bottom of stone and their right hand oh Lord has become glorious and thy power thy right hand oh Lord is dashed in pieces the enemy in the greatness of thine Excellency thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sendest forth thy wrath and consumed them as stubble with the blast of our nostrils the waters were gathered and the flood stood up as a heath and the depths were congealed in the heart of the Sea and the enemy said I will pursue and the enemy said I will prot overtake and the enemy said I will Defi and th spoil and my lust shall be satisfied over them and I will draw my sword and my hand shall destroy them but thou did blow with thy wind and the Sea covered them and they sank as lead in The Mighty Waters Hallelujah who is like unto the oh Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious and Holiness fearful and Praises doing wonders thou stretches out thy right hand and the Earth swallows him thou in thy mercy has led forth the people which thou has redeemed thou has guided them in thy strength into thy holy habitation the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall hold onto the inhabitants of palestinia and the Dukes of Adam shall be amazed the Mighty Men of Moab trembling shall take hold upon them fear and dread shall fall upon them all by the greatness of thine arm they shall be still as a stone till thy people pass over till thy people Passover which thou Hast purchased Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place oh Lord which I have made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary oh Lord which thy hands have established the Lord shall reign forever and ever for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and the Lord brought the the Waters of the sea upon them but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea and about that time Mariam couldn't handle no more she grabbed a TR amberine and she be to dance begin to sing the Praises of the Lord for her God had triumphed over her enemy the Lord could you imagine brother Tom when she looked down in that sea and she saw that same one that had whed her that same one that had misused her that same one that had power over her didn't have power no more that'll cause you to a different song when you realize that enemy he don't have power over you no more he don't have the abilities no more but his back was broke at Calvary Hallelujah he'll give you a new song to sing he'll give you a new song to sing some of y'all need a new song to sing you s your your life singing out doubts and singing out unbelief and singing out all kinds of worries and fretting and all kinds of you need a new song to sing well you don't know who you don't know what all I've been through you're right I don't but God does God knows everything that we've ever been through he knows every he knows the Gat that bats its eye so if he knows ever Sparrow he said he said my eyes are on the sparrow he said not one of them can fall to the ground without the heavenly father knowing about it well if he knows about a little bitty bird how much more does he know about those that were created in his very image he knows the hurts you've been through he knows the problems you faced he knows the struggles but he's here to give you a new song but you got to be willing to sing it I mean I know this church has been it's all kind of church who's been through a lot of hurts a lot of pains a lot of difficulties a lot of people saying things doing I understand we all go through them but you got to be willing to sing a new song Psalms 28:7 says the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusts to him and I am help therefore my heart greatly rejoices and with my song will I praise him with my song the Lord is their strength and he's the saving strength of his anointing save thy people and bless thy inheritance feed them up also and lift them up forever you know in Revelations 5 and verse one it talks about the angel that came down with a loud voice and it begins to talk about the elders that were around the throne worthy to take a book and how John be to weep because no one was worthy but all of a sudden the lamb stepped out and there was one wory to take a book in verse n it says and they sang a new song they sang a song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof th was slain as redeemed us to God by our blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and has made us Kings and Priests a new song so quit singing the song of unworthiness and start singing the song of the Lamb's worthy quit singing what you've done or how you failed or your mistakes or what's somebody done for you and start singing about what God has done for you God's got this church here for a reason it ain't just for you to come and have just a comfortable Pew to sit on and fulfill your Sunday duties or your Christian duties no it has been put here for a lighthouse to a Dy world [Applause] come on even and light it's time for the light to shine in our lives and the song of joy to come out of our lives and praise our God for we are still here serving him we are still here living for him no matter what Satan has done to try to destroy the work of God we are still here amen hallelujah Psalms 98 8 vers1 oh sing unto the Lord a new song for he has done marvelous things Psalms 98:4 says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all the Earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise huh kind of goes against that message Church of Christ teaching but anyway sing a make a loud noise hey don't be get mad at me pi up Stone throw me at me it's in the Bible right Psalms 149 and verse one says praise the Lord singing the Lord a new song and is praised in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name in the dance oh whoops let them sing praises to Him with a timbering heart for the Lord had taken pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon the their beds let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand to execute vengeance upon the Heathen and Punishment upon the people and to bind their kings with chains yeah now David dealt with a physical enemy we're not here fighting a physical enemy we're fighting a spiritual enemy but the same word that applies to the physical applies to the spiritual so let us sing to our god with a sword in our hand and let us bind the enemy that would come against the Church of the Living God and say devil you're not welcome here no more but I am here to praise God I'm here to lift him up I'm here to glorify his I don't care if you don't praise him I'm going to praise him if you what you do won't hinder me I am going to praise God cuz God has done wondrous things in my life I praise the Lord Psalms 150 and verse one says praise ye the Lord I mean we can almost quote this one but do you live it praise God in the sanctuary Praise Him in the firment of his power praise him for his mighty acts let back up a little bit in the sanctuary

trumpet praise him with the Suter in the heart praise him with the timberl in the dance there it goes again praise him with a string instrument and organs praise him with its loud symbols praise him against the high sounding symbols people read their Bible they wouldn't have no problem with drums either would they anyway let us let everything that hath breath praise the Lord how many's got breath then you have a direct commandment from the bible let everything that ha breath praise ye the Lord give him glory all you Saints for he has done great and marvelous things in our generation and when I say that I'm not even just talking about 60 years ago I'm talking about today [Music] [Applause] I'm talking about in this service I'm right now God is moving in our midst I I know it's probably been told but I'll tell it again sister Landa butts in our church with that cancer sitting in the backseat back there in isolation because you couldn't be around people because of her immune system being so tore down by the medicine she was having the the stuff that they put on chemo and she is back there and my dad begins to preach on Bible days or here again and he actually brings out about how different one of brother bram's contemporaries and begin to read different ones Jack Moore and different ones statements about the ministry of William brandham and I think it was Jack Moore that said it he don't he come down to the end of didn't believe it but he said the Bible days are here again and here here he's preaching along this line and this little 90s something pound woman back there so frail the doctors thought of the the Kemo was going to end up killing her but they was trying to do everything they could to save her life she's sitting in the back but under the inspiration she begins to move into a realm of praise and my dad begins to sing a song what have I to dread what have I to fear leaning on the Everlasting Arms it so overwhelmed that little 90s something PB woman she jumped out of her seat and she ran around that building giving praise to God about the second time it's on tell about the second time she come around my voice The Voice spoke out of my Dad's mouth and said maram your enemy's dead she would go to the doctor the next day on Monday morning to get more pet scans and they look she's now about almost halfway through treatments and they looked and all the cancer was gone it confused the doctors they didn't know what to do they said we never seen this before she said it's my God my God moved on my behalf he touched my life she sang a new song what have I to dread what out I'm lean the arms of my beloved he's got me he won't let me fall he won't let me be ashamed and stumble and fall and crumble to Pieces but he has me in his hands I think about the scripture this is whole another the sermon but I just want to bring it in right here for a moment I'm trying to move through this but in the Bible David said my people will never be ashamed in other words you look into that you'll find that he means he won't leave you broken he won't leave you in a crumbled up place to where you're so pulled inward that you think nobody cares nobody but he's going to come and he's going to move on your behalf and he's going to touch you and he's going to minister to you and he's going to pick you up Hallelujah he's going to come on the scene and he's going to take what looks so broken and make it into something so beautiful I actually got the studying on this want to bring this part into it there's a process in Japan is called kugi kugi I think is how they pronounce it but it's where like if you was had your grandma's or great-grandmother's dish that had been passed down through generations favorite and You' picked it out for a certain celebration and you had brought it over to put it on the table and you ate gravy out of it or whatever you put in it went to take it and you went to put it back in the sink to wash it and on your way you stumbled and fell and it just shattered into pieces they actually take that they don't sweep it up and throw it all away but they got a process that they take that Potter and they gather all the pieces up and they put it all back together and you know I found where they take that you know what they put it together with brother Tom gold and they take and they say actually the value of the vessel is worth more after it's broken than before it's broken because of what they can do to it and and the gold that they place inside their life and I got to thinking about that that's exactly what God does with us he allows us to get in places where we feel so broken and we feel I'm worthless ain't no help I can be to anybody ain't nobody wants me but God does and he just patiently pick up all the pieces and starts putting it back together but in those places those cracks and those voids he's filling it with deity and I looked at I looked at some of these vessels and and I was just amazed and I I just got them here I'll just share them with you but I'm amazed at what they can look like after they take them and they're broken and they've been destroyed and look like ought to be throw in the garbage look like they ought to be worthless and worthless to anybody or everybody but a master can gather them and he can put them all back together using gold amen using gold to put it all back and the the the latter part of the vessel is worth more than the former Hallelujah when I think about my whole life and how I and how I was broken but thank God He Didn't Throw the Clay Away but he picked me up and he molded it back into his image and in those cracks and those crevices he just fills it with gold deity to where I'm in a unique vessel and there's one not one vessel the same cuz when we fall we don't all break in the same places we don't all break the same lines in the same way in the same manner but God wants is in an individual way to be made into his Beauty this is where he's at but it's all determined on where if you can put your hands in him if you can lay your life in him and rest say Lord I've tried on my own but I can't put myself back together I've tried but I can't make it I've tried to make this match up and that match up and I'm just making a jump humbled mess put yourself in his hands he knows why you're where you're at he knows what you're going through and he's not going to leave you ashamed because he said my people will never be ashamed but I think about as we begin to bring this down think about it one of my favorite stories in the Bible is Paul and Silas they had been in a church service and there was this damsel that was possessed with a Spirit of divination brought to her brought by her Masters to gain to for much gain by susay and and they followed Paul and she cried and you know Paul being grieved he turned and rebuked that spirit and commanded it to leave and they saw her delivered you know you think that they would love to see somebody delivered but they were making money off of this and so they they get angry and mad and they beat Paul and the scripture says they brought him before the magistrates and and the multitude rose up again against them and they laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison and charged the Jailer to keep them safely who having such received such a charge put them in the inner prison other words maximum security in the inner prison charging and made the and made their feet fast in stalks now been real easy to stop a minute and say you know what Paul I didn't ask for this I mean I but I I I wanted to PR go see it and ended up like this I mean it's ridiculous I mean look at us we're real winners ain't we look here we really doing something ain't we that wasn't their idea that wasn't the way it happened I'm boy my Bible reads cursings in that prison and people screaming out I ain't done nothing wrong I ain't got no reason to be here but in the inner part of this prison Bible says at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them they're in the innermost part of this prison and here they begin to sing and I I just want to put it in my own my own thoughts right now but I I just look as they're sitting there picture sitting there beat blood running down big old mushed up lip hair T up and P patches out they've been whipped and beat and blood everywhere and their feets in stalks and they're in bonds and they're and old Paul looks over Silas said you know what Silas what's that Paul I feel like praise and praise praising him well I feel like praising praising him well I praise him in the morning I'll praise him in the jail house I feel like praising praising him well let's all praise the Lord while we have this chance you don't know when it's going to be the last one let's all praise the Lord while we have this chance we praise him in the morning Praise Him in this church service let's all praise the Lord while we have this [Music] chance atmospheres begin to change things begin to take place now I actually begin to study on this and I I realized sing praises meant they actually begin to sing the Passover Psalms well what's the Passover Psalms well it's seven Psalms in the Bible seven chapters seven that's amazing to me because seven in church ages there's one for every Church age you know that's amazing to me I I just learned the other day as brother Matt Watkins had been over in Israel and he found he found in Israel that where there was two two instances of Jesus feeding 5,000 or one of feeding 5,000 one feeding 4,000 you remember the story one tells about 12 baskets left over and five fish and two loaves of bread one talks about seven loaves one talks about seven baskets LIF if you actually study where those two places to one was he fed the Gentiles and one he fed the Jews and to the Gentiles it was seven Loaves and seven baskets left over my God he's perfect to the Jews there was 12 12 tribes 12 Apostles 12 Elders come on somebody so it said Passover Psalms it's Psalms 113 114 115 116 117 and 118 and 136 if you want to read them later I ain't going to read all of them because I ain't got time but I'm going to read the first one could you imagine this coming out of their mouth they got all these things upon them praise ye the Lord wait a minute Paul you lost your mind praise ye Servants of the Lord praise the name of the Lord Lord blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forever more from the rising of the sun until the going down of the Saint the lord's name is to be praised hallelujah amen do you hear the word of God it he didn't tell you what's going to go on during that day what's going to transpire during that day whether you're going to end up in jail during that day whether you're going to be sick at the end of the day it does not matter when the rising of the till the going down of the same his name is to be praised for the Lord is high above all nations his glory above the heavens who is liken the Lord Our God who dwelleth on high who humble himself to behold the things are in heaven and the Earth he raises the poor Out of the Dust and lifts the needy out of the dong Hill that he may set him with princes even the princes of his people he maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children pray praise ye the Lord hallelujah now you can go on down you can go home and read those it's a good reading good study but you go and start reading down through those chapters you'll begin to be see that they begin to speak their Deliverance they begin to sing the song and now their song you can read it it's in the scripture in these Psalms thou has loosed my bonds amen thank you Lord in the next place it says tremble oh oh thou Earth they begin to worship God and to praise him and out of their praise begin to their Deliverance come on somebody that's why the devil wants to keep your praise bound up he wants to keep you down in the dirt and down in the frustration down in depression down and down and down and down but if you'll just throw up those hands and begin to worship God and begin to praise him with your mouth and begin to thank him for all that he's done you will begin to speak your deliverance Hallelujah I said you will begin to speak your in Deliverance Hallelujah and they begin to worship God and the atmosphere begin to change it didn't just affect where they said it didn't just affect their or their cell or where they was at but it affected the whole place Hallelujah that's why brother brandom said if I can give one or two people on fire for God it'll do more for a church than for the revivals woo brother Tom if we can get one or two people to start praising God to look beyond their doubts look beyond their fears look beyond their frustration and just lift up their hand anyhow say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Lord you brought me out of bondage you brought me into this truth you brought me into Victory I am not a child of the devil I belong to [Applause] Jesus and they begin to sing and you can read it it's all down through the scriptures and all the way down to our generation our church age is 136 and if you'll notice what's in EMP ized in 136 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever every verse his mercy endureth forever his mercy endureth forever his mer go read his mercy endureth forever his mercy endureth forever his mercy endureth forever his mercy endureth forever his Mercy end I mean all the way down all the way down and I'll just get down to the last part of this who redeemed us in our lowest state for his mercy endureth forever who redeemed us from our enemies for his mercy endureth forever who giveth food to All Flesh for his mercy endureth forever oh give thanks unto the god of Heaven for his mercy endureth forever and suddenly there was a great earthquake so the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all there we go again all the doors were open and everyone's bands were [Applause] [Music] loosed come on somebody all because two people begin to praise God not in a church service not in a good condition not in an air condition not in their best health not in their Prime but be and down and discouragement was all over them but they refused to look at it and

about a little girl about 16 years old at our church went on a Wednesday night and we had a prayer line just a random out of the blue prayer line form it went to midnight that night of God begin to deliver listen I saw so many miracles that night it was incredible I saw warts hundreds of warts over a body of a little boy they pray for and they're all gone I saw my mother who had just went through her first brain breed and she had been so down and so weak she couldn't even stand on her feet for very long and she wanted to come to that service and dad said sure you're coming said they brought people to the house of God when brother Brandon was in was here that you can sit in the office and he said when the time gets right I'm going to bring you out and God's going to show himself Among Us that was his attitude and about that time as it be to move and things begin to build he brought her out and God fell upon her so strongly she stood for two and 1 half hours with her hands up in the air praising God listen I know prayer I know praise works I know it works I seen it work I witness it to work I've seen it working my mother who was so weak she's sitting on the side of the bed depressed because she didn't thought her life was over and she thought it was finished she thought there ain't no way I can be a mother no more I can't be a grandmother no more I can't be a wife no more I'm here in a condition I can't hardly see out of my eyes Lord what am I going to do but all of a sudden her hands went up in the the air and she began to praise God and about that time my sister brought a little boy that was living with him at the time and brought him sit him in the middle of the room 18 months old brother Tom never walked and never crawled doctor said his hip wasn't developed he would never walk without a surgery or therapy and here he's sitting in the middle of the wall of the floor but right Vision he had been seen walk God still does that amen here she's sitting over there depressed and she's sitting all there worried and she lifts up her hands and she begins to praise God and the spirit of God com to that room gave her sight back went across that little boy he jumped out of the middle of the floor and ran all over that house I'm not telling you about a god 60 years ago I'm talking about what right now if you praise him he'll fight your battles
