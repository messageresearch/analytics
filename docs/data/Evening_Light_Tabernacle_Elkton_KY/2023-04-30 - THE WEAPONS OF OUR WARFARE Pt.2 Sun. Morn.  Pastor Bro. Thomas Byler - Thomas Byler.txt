I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice and my suffocations foreign trouble in sorrow gracious is the Lord and righteous yea our God is merciful return unto thy rest O my soul for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living I said in my haste all men are liars I will take the cup of Salvation and call upon the name of the Lord obviously crashes in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints and we'll call upon the name of the Lord this one together in the courts of the Lord's House in the midst of the Jerusalem praise ye the Lord amen everyone could be seated brother Daniel good morning everyone amen if uh turn with me if you will to First Samuel 16 and verse 7. foreign said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stats because I have refused him for for the Lord seeth not as man see it for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart amen what what I want to speak on this morning is character that there the Lord looks on the heart rather than looking on on the outward apparent see um God chose David not because he he not because he was the the greatest of them and you would think if you were picking one of them you would pick the strongest and which one and would be the most suitable for a king a warrior someone that looks strong and and we would look on the outside as as human beings that's how we are we look at people uh as in in like how they look how strong they are if I was in picking the the one and to become king and like Samuel was picking picking who who was it that was going to be even next King it was a very important thing that he he couldn't rely on on his own own abilities to find someone here to um hear what what God would want and what him the one who got would uh choose instead of what he would think would be the best now uh brother Brandon says it like this um he says now Christian friends we're all in eternity being bound people every one of us here has got to meet God and face God someday and we're going to give an account for the Deeds that's done in our lives now if I told you I was a gangster and had the the spirit of John Dillinger or was upon me well you'd you'd expect me to have guns and be that kind of a character because his Spirit what was on me if I told you I had the spirit of an artist some great famous artist you'd expect me to be able to catch the scene of the Waves when I was tipping of the of the sunset when it was as Tiffany of the sunset and almost bring it out out in life's color if I had the spirit of an artist in me I would do the work of an artist and if we had the spirit of Christ when we do the works of Christ in the spirit that was upon him he said a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age amen Romans 5 and verse 3 3 is a to three to five it says and not only any so but but we glory and tribulation is also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us amen character cannot be developed in ease in in quiet only through experience of trial and suffering can this will be strength and vision cleared ambition inspired and success achieved this is a quote by um someone named uh Helen Keller I'm not sure who that is but but it's it it's it's true it's it's true that's why God puts us through new trials and tribulations when we don't feel like we understand what and what's going on like why we're going through this and then later on as you age you realize that was to build your character and who you are as a person because that's way more important than than it's it's way more important than than how um great great of a a uh person and people see see you to be but if you're if behind the scenes you're you're truly a dark person and and even if if you're outward um person that people see on the outside your reputation is good but then and what when nobody's looking that's who you really are when when nobody's ACS what you're doing and nobody sees what kind of a person you are behind the scenes that's who who you really are because you can put on on a different person you can put on a different personality while you're away from people I've seen this so many times when when all of a sudden you become someone else when you're talking to someone that it really matters how how you look to them and you really change it seem to change as a person and and all of a sudden you're like yeah you're you're such a great person all of a sudden everybody thinks highly of you but then when you go back to actually your home it's it's like you you know no longer that person anymore and and so it says here that this is another quote watch your thoughts for they become words watch your words for they become actions watch your actions for they become habits watch your habits before they become character watch your character for it becomes your destiny amen a character is the foundation of a person's life and it is built on the choices we make the Bible tells us that our character is shaped by our actions and our attitudes we are called to be people of Integrity honesty and compassion we are to love our neighbors as ourselves to be kind and patient to seek Justice and mercy our character is not just about what we do but who we are it is a reflection of our heart and our relationship with God as proverbs 4 23 says it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life our character is something that we must intentionally cultivate through prayer reading the word of God and putting into practice what we after we become more like Christ and we are able a life that is pleasing to God and beneficial to others amen it is it is so important who we are as as Believers not just who we we appear to others not just as what what other people see on us because that's our reputation there's a difference between simply your reputation and your character because people can think highly of you and think you're such a great person yeah and but but behind the scenes you could have a dark heart and and be far from God be far from from who you appear to be to others so so it's very important and that the most important thing is to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that'll bring about your character that'll bring about uh God and that'll bring God on the scene in your heart to change your life to make you a better person not just not not just this you decided I'm gonna be this great person and you can and try to do that what by works but you'll only go so far but with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll be able to become I'm the person that God has called you to be a to the fullness uh the fullness of a statue of a man that's the only way you'll get get to that place is with the baptism the Holy Ghost and so so even with the baptism of the Holy Ghost once you receive the weapons of the Holy Ghost citizen finish there got it and it's just beginning to work God is just us beginning in the work and and so so he has come to to build build you up as a person build you up as a Christian and so new Believers that have just been born again they're they're not not uh to the to they can they will end up making tons of mistakes even after the baptism Holy Ghost because of our own flesh and and you know it's it's still an onward battle that we we go through each and every day and so so God oh build us up and bring us through those trials and tribulations and bring about our character and build our character and and so so that we might be able to be in his perfect will because that that is God's desire for each and every one of us this morning is for for us to be in in his perfect will tell to have the character of Christ that's why are we we are to follow Christ in everything we do and follow this word and stay with it Amen brother brother David ignore that this morning amen God bless you man hey man it's just so good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and man pray your hearts are expecting amen if you come expecting you will be filled this morning amen let's sing a little course I will enter into his

privilege to be able to stand in his presence this morning and just to be thankful for what he's done for us and amen just pray that God will come speak to our hearts pray for our pastor this morning he's a little tired in his body but we just pray the Lord to just give him strength this morning to deliver what's upon his heart and I sing that song his way with thee on page 395 if we could amen is that your desire that the Lord will have his way with you this morning amen we've got a lot gone several are gone to the meetings and just pray the Lord will bless them and those that are sick this morning pray that he'll just go to where they're at and touch them this morning well would you live for Jesus and be always here and good what would you walk with him [Music] his way [Music] [Music]

[Music] amen aren't you thankful for him doing that for you this morning and amen we're not we're not what we ought to be but thank God we're not what we're used to being by his grace we'll be what he wants us to be amen let's sing that old song I love this song that come on my heart this morning God's abiding pieces in my soul today it is my time this morning [Music] amen are you thankful for his peace this morning and in a world that's totally falling apart when we wake up in the morning brother John we don't really have any worries say well we got lots of issues lots of problems we just cast

was praying the other morning I got to thinking and then the song and I thought about it again and I thought you know Lord if you've never really been sick you don't really know how you'll react to things and and I I begin to Marvel I begin to think about sister Sherry and every time I ask her how you doing she said I'm doing really good and she said I know that it's all in God's hands this morning and I thought you know Lord help help me this morning because I'll tell you sometimes when I don't feel very good I kind of get wimpy and I just and sometimes I just don't have the faith that I need but I thought Lord give me that faith and then I think what our Prophet said he said when he would eat that food and it would come back up and he'd eat it again and I thought boy that must have been really rough but he kept on confessing that God had healed him and somebody said well brother Bill you're not he said yes I am healed by his stripes I'm Healed this morning you know I I begin to think of all that and I thought Lord help us all to have that faith because brother Branham come as an example to us to put our trust in God that he had seen work and he knew he was able to do it and you know what he always taught us what was his theme song only believe some things are possible no he said all things are possible we serve an on-time God this morning and and we believe that he's a Healer this morning but the Daniel and brother Michael Jonathan Carson and this morning and we have several prayer requests but the Brad's not here uh brother Weston had some car problems he's gone remember him as he's traveled on the road and remember all those that are gone to the meetings that'll be coming home and just pray that God will give them traveling mercy and also uh for the Micah buyers running a fever this morning I want to remember the Micah in prayer this morning that God would just touch his body and our shut-in sister Peggy and sister parish and sister Angie the different ones and also my brother-in-law we've been praying for Tim and uh he they've got him out of his induced coma and he went to him yesterday he's got some issues still from his stroke and uh pray for us in the morning me and Jan and Mom are going to go uh up there by St Louis and see him in the hospital and just pray that we can be a blessing to them and you know they just they're just down you know how the enemy likes to beat us up but you know we just pray that God will just help him this morning and you know I I say I say this and you know because I've been I've I once had to recognize what God had done for me just pray that the Lord will speak to his heart spiritually more than his health because if he if he doesn't if he doesn't save him it's not going to do it's heal him but he needs the Lord in all his heart so remember the Tim his family and he just needs a touch from the Lord this morning and I know God Babel if he can last raise you know have Lazarus raised from the grave after being dead four days I'm sure a stroke is no big deal to him this morning amen so if you hadn't eat on your heart you might let it be known by the uplifting hand and rashford the Josh if he'd stand and pray over the offering yes ma'am afraid of um [Music] [Music] all right this is Josh we know you're still a great position to this day thinking about little Georgia Carter who's on the bed

get out of the way Lord Jesus for we asking in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen enjoy Sunday school this morning amen music and everything and so amen now uh it just doesn't seem like I could get away from what we spoke on I think it was Wednesday I believe it was amen and talking about the weapons of our Warfare so we're going to talk about the weapons of our Warfare part two amen part two in will Kyle or title this builds to withstand built to withstand is that all right hey man and so I do have some statements I think that I don't remember that I don't remember hearing or perhaps even making making myself this morning but amen I feel like the Lord's given me something good this morning I trust it'll be good for you amen amen praise the Lord let's turn our Bibles into the book of Ephesians if you will book of Ephesians chapter 6. there is a lot of things that we are a type of Amen like the Bride of Jesus Christ the Church of the Living God where children of God you know but in this instance it puts us in the category of soldiers isn't that right soldiers amen finally Brethren verse 10 chapter 6 of Ephesians finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against amen isn't that right how many believes there's some things we have to stand against there's a lot of things that you're going to have to stand against The Wiles of the devil one place I believe the Bible says that when Satan comes in like a flood isn't that right God will set up a standard against it so it's not just some Wilds but it's a flood and you and I are certainly seeing that flood for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand or can we say to withstand withstand therefore amen amen having your loins go to Bow is truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and having your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith where would you work with he shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there with all perseverance and supplications to make known The Mystery of the gospel for which I am a Ambassador in bonds that there and I may speak boldly as I ought to speak may God add His blessings to the reading and the words you can be seated this morning praise the Lord amen amen so one first thing I want to say is that we are of course in a contest how many believe that I believe Alabama says the contest he preached a message called the contest between God and Satan and of course you and I are in that contest or could we say in this battle or in this fight amen everybody that's born in in this world is is forced I'm going to say Force into a contest you're forced to fight you don't have a choice amen you really don't because and I'll say this that you either kill him or he'll kill you that's how it is you're either going to have to get a better hymn or he will get the better of you amen and so that's where we're at praise the Lord he either destroy him or he'll destroy you man they're you're in the battle how many believes were in the battle the greatest battle that ever was fought amen a lot of my quotes of course this morning will come from a message called the greatest battle that was ever fought and so we meant we're gonna uh we touched a lot on that and I and I looked and seen the quote where brother Brandon was really talking about that how that and he he said if the devil can get into any one of those channels he can get in there he'll have you amen and we have to guard and keep him out of there amen and keep the guarded by the holy spirit amen because if you keep keep it guarded by this Holy Spirit and you keep those in check if it's amazing and I'll make my first comment about some of the things that I've heard and and so forth because uh you know some of the brothers are the things that's been said I mean he started out with the very very same thing brother brother Dwayne Lawson did and I don't know if you all stream that or not but I really wanted to just play that this morning but but we live by faith we look at the Unseen not the scene and how did this here the five senses and all of that of course he went into area that I had never even thought about going and we just had a really really good time amen but you know I think it was Caleb and my and Tommy also they they uh have been talking just talking to me and of course each other and they've been streaming a lot of preachers I have not streamed very many preachers at all here lately I have a little bit more than I used to but amen I I usually it is very good but you know one thing they said and I've seen when I was over there and that is that you know it's the same Holy Spirit same Holy Spirit and even they said it's amazing how the thieving the things that I've been preaching and now that think they've been talking about things they've heard others and how did it's the same holy spirit amen and it shows that God is doing is doing something something's going on Amen how many know that you and I want to be a part of that what just going on
