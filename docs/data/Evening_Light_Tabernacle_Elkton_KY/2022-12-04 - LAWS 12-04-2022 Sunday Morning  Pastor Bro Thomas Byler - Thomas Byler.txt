uh Sunday school will next few weeks just give everybody a heads up of what's going on uh some of the sisters have gotten together and they'll be putting on a Christmas program again this year uh first time in a while the kids are really excited so I encourage the kids and so over the next few weeks they'll be using their Sunday school time to kind of rehearse and practice and go over things so as we dismiss the children for Sunday school they'll go to the back uh one of the Sunday School teachers or one of the sisters will lead you in which direction to go so let's be praying for them and encourage them I think they're excited about getting this together and I'm excited to see it how about you amen so we'll dismiss for Sunday school at this time as they dismissing brother Joe would you open the service and prayer for us foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign worn out in the world our loved ones our brothers our models today Lord Jesus [Music] come back if you would Psalm 63 we'll read a portion of scripture there good to have Carter Glover with us and as you're turning there just to welcome him he's visiting with Western he's from Hopkinsville so you may have heard of his family the Glovers they used to travel and sing and Carter was playing drums I think when he was five years old traveling all over the country in a in a bus and so he's been around and his family has sung in many many states across the United States there so thank you thankful for Carter to be here with us Psalm 63 oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longest for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee my soul shall be satisfied as with Morrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips education because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go up and into the lower parts of the Earth all together but the king shall rejoice in God everyone that sweareth by him shall Glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped brother Brian brothers and sisters you know that first verse there's pretty profound for the age that we live in I'll just reread it again oh God Thou Art my God early will I see thirst is for thee my flesh long is for thee in a drawing of thirsty lamb where no water is and outside of the Gospel of Jesus Christ out there in the world it's a dry desert you know there's no life out there I know it looks sometimes it can look like it's wonderful and it's beautiful but it's really not it's just death in the desert out there the only thing that really matters is what you have as a relationship this morning with Jesus Christ if you would turn with me to you know uh to the 16th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew you know it's what first Sunday in December and 2023 is just excuse me 2022 has just gone gone by the 12 months I don't know it must be as the older you get time goes faster or but uh it just seems like it was yesterday it was January 2022. but let me read a few of these scriptures this morning here and uh Jesus there's several things that go on in the 16th chapter you know any of the gospels you know three years three and a half years of Jesus life is condensed in anywhere from 20 to 28 chapters in different and different gospels but so there's a lot of stuff that's going on here I'll just start at the first verse and the Pharisees Pharisees also with the Sadducees came tempting him Desiring him that he would show them a sign from heaven you know we all have friends like that we've all had people like that and he goes on the answer and said unto them when it is even you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather for today for the skies red and lowering oh you Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times and that we're in the same place this morning you know that the world is just full of intelligent people there's nothing wrong with being intelligent there's nothing wrong with education but if you're using your education and your intelligence to for anything other than the kingdom of God then there's no purpose in it and he goes on to say here a wicked in adulterous generation seeketh after a sign there's no sign be given unto you but the sign of the Prophet Jonas and he left them and departed and when his disciples were they had forgotten to take bread and Jesus said unto them take heed and Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the side the season we're no different this morning you and I there's no difference this morning you got to be aware of of what you link yourself to or what you're getting around because you know just a little leaven will make you unprofitable on that day it goes on he reasoned among and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have taken no bread so that's just the human aspect of the disciples you know we're no better than they are you know sometimes we get worried about or think about things that God isn't really wanting us to worry about at that time and again they and he goes on to say which one Jesus received he said unto them oh you have little faith why reason you among yourselves because you have brought no bread do you not understand neither remember the Five Loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up so Christ is showing them the Miracles that have just had and they're still worrying about things that they've seen that he's more than able to provide and we're no different in the age that we live in we have numerous examples of what God will do for us as individuals if we just believe them but yet we find ourselves worrying about things we have no control over and he says do you remember understand neither remember the five gloves in the five thousands and how many baskets you took up neither the seven lows or the four thousand on how many baskets you took up how does it you do not understand and I expect it not to you concerning bread but you should be aware of the loving of the Pharisees and the Sadducees then understood how they he begged them not to Beware of the leaven of of the bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and we're no different this morning and I I was reading in this uh book here this morning and it it kind of kind of speaks that it's uh this message here uh day of Cavalry but I'll just read some of these what brother Branham had to say you know Paul said it brother Brandon said as thou follow Christ you follow me the same with brother Thomas or your father or your mother as they follow Christ you follow them and so God gives you the revelation of the truth of the Gospel of the hour then you you have examples that you that you don't you're not going to fall or rise or fall by them but God gives you examples to show you the right way from the wrong way and you just got to know the right way and he goes on I'll read it's the 110th if the church can now um are probably lost my place here let me see no I'm in the right place if the church can ever come to those fundamentals those facts that it's not something you tried to do you work yourself up to do it's something that it's born in you and you all know this morning you can't manufacture Christianity you can't manufacture it it's something that you've got to believe and God's got to change your heart and your life you can't manufacture that and he goes on forgive me my Pentecost for friends that I'm Pentecostal but my Pentecostal friends has got the spot where it has to be a a lot of fast music beating of some bands or clapping emotion they play in the bands before they go to battle they get people in the emotional battle they believe in music and I believe in clapping hands but I also believe in these things that exactly true we ought to have it but yet you have left the great things on done it is the self-sacrifice life that God gives you automatically doing that which is right because it's right and that's what he was saying here Christ is saying you can't manufacture it it's just it comes from the inside out it's who you are this morning and then he goes on to say here but you left the great thing undone it's the self-sacrifice of life that God gives you automatically doing that which is right because it's right just going on don't even think nothing about it just living it then watch and see what's going on you'll just you don't you're on the highway that's what Calvary did to you on the highway opened up in that day uh I'm not that it's amusing but it's really true what he's about to say here it's what the Bible says and your experiences you know you you're either a goat or you're a sheep you're either a pig or you're a horse there's no in between there's no hybrids in it it's just you're either a goat or you're a sheep you're either a horse or a pig that's what you are I'm not making fun of it you either a Christian you're you're a non-believer but there's no in between there's no grayers it's just black and white and he goes on to say here uh you just you don't you're on the highway that's coward did you or the highway opened up that day for you now you remember you cannot be a half goat or a half sheep they don't mix it goes on to say here there's a lot of people who say yes you know but we got an organization in our group we we help the poor we do this that's all right but you're tooting your horn about it you don't do that you know brother brannerman Jesus said you don't let the right hand know what the left hand is doing you do your arms and secrets Jesus said just automatically something to you no more than going getting a drink of water you're thirsty if the next man is thirsty you think about him too the next man's need you think about him same as you would your own need you don't pay no attention you just live it live on and you just you can't be half sheep or half goat and I was gonna jump down here but I was wanting to read something else this morning I really I'm sure you all get that feeling sometimes where God speaks to you and tells you when to say something and when not to say something you know we all are we're all candles we're all lies that God has given us for us salvation experience and God will teach you and show you the path that you need to walk in your daily life and not everyone's path is going to be the same path not everyone's way is going to be the same way but there's one thing that's consistent and everyone has to have it that way is led by Jesus Christ through his experience in him but what you might God might have you be and what he might have maybe are two different things this morning enough this is I'll read this and and sit down and this is a come down to the I'm getting ahead of my myself it comes out of the Epistle of John the first Epistle of John the third chapter of the eighth and Ninth verse and we all know this is the truth uh he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil senteth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested so what the gospel is saying here Jesus Christ came to manifest the fact that who one thing he did most of all he showed the people of his day who the devil was and his works and he showed what God was and what God's works are and he goes um and for this purpose the Son of God was manifested he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God does not commit sin now this is God's word this ain't my word here so this is what the scriptures say about you as a Christian and goes on to say here for his seed remaineth in him and he can not sin because he's born of God these are God's word this isn't my interpretation this is what John said through the gospel and this is what his take is on it and it goes on you this story everyone knows do you ever take your camera and set it on infinite well it just means you're thereafter all right there's no focus in it anymore well that's what God is he's infinite the experience of Jesus Christ is infinite they're they're there's no boxing he's infant there could be no Beetle not a fly not a flea not a mouse not a and some of these things are very uncomfortable but they're here and but this is me this is what he's saying or nothing that ever was on Earth or ever will be but was God noted before the before the world was formed there's no some conception of infinite so basically everything that we see everything that we feel God knows about it and he goes on to say here well then the infinite God who saves you here knowing he's gonna he's gonna lose you next week or next month or next year I say this a lot myself the gospel gospel Hope Christian home is a done deal if God saved you he's not going to lose you There's Hope in that there's trust in that that's Christian hope now the Hope out there in the world that your brother is going to do the right thing or your boss has got that's that's filio typo but God's type of Hope Christian hope it's a settled the score is settle God if God said he's going to save you God's going to save you there's no doubt in it and he goes before the Earth was ever formed there's no conception well the infinite God who saves you here no he's going to lose you next week and next month or next year while he's defeating the very purpose he can't lose you he inherit my words and believeth on me that him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into the Judgment but has done passed from Death on to life that's a settled score there that's God's word right there he it goes back to what I was just saying here I won't repeat myself he can't do it he that is born of God does not commit sin and I a lot of our brothers and sisters have problem with this what this is about to say here for the seed of God remains in him he cannot sin how can he sin when there's a sin offering for him and that's all that's everything that we lean on right now that sin offering that God adds for us and how can you sin when there's a sin offering for him how can he be sick when I'm perfectly healthy how can I be blind when I can see you oh my how can I be in the building and out of the building at the same time how can I be drunk and sober at the same same time it goes back to what I was saying earlier you're there's no half gold half sheep you're either a sheep or a goat I'm a building out there same time how can I be drunk or sober at the same time you can't do it and when you're saved and you're under the atonement your sins are not wrecking on to you now this is what God said and he goes on to say here did not Dave say blessed is the man who God will not reckon sin and put sin to it God don't hold sin against this creature that's strong it isn't and this is really true right here this will divide whole families believing a simple truth like this it isn't skim milk but that's the Bible God will not reconcine to the righteous God by his grace through predestination there's whole churches out there when you mention predestination and we'll just their minds will go they'll lose it not willing that any should perish but all might come to repentance but the infinity knowing who would come and who would not come he could predestinate everything to the work to his will if he didn't do it why would he permit sin in the first place has there ever been a sinner that would never have been a savior attributes within him could not be pulled out and I'll just finish with this simple thought or you know it's a comforting thought if we come to the end of the year I know I say this a lot I don't mean to say but it's the truth and if God ever saved you he's put a spirit in you and his life in your heart then you have a hope and that hope is an eternal hope that God wouldn't have started that journey in you if he wasn't going to finish with you this morning brother David amen amen he's good isn't he managed full course if we could let's stand this morning and sing that oh yes oh yes I'm a child of the king

of Jesus Christ amen and amen didn't want to do something just before I am going to the word of God wanted to give a report on uh on where we're at financially you know Brian usually does it but I thought with this occasion maybe I just say something amen and me and brother Brian both signed that paper last Monday I believe it was having sold six point something Acres of that field and then so it's not ours anymore amen you know sometimes I sell a vehicle and actually not so long ago but sometimes you sell stuff and you're like oh man I wish I wouldn't have sold that you know but in this case I'm glad we did I mean I feel good about it amen feels good amen and so uh we was at I guess around 69 000 earlier this year I believe it was that we owed on this place yet you know and it's been quite a few years coming amen and so I think I made a big mistake uh us and the board maybe not a little mistake anyway and partially my fault but holding brother Brian back on paying the extra over the years but amen that wasn't smart how many knows it's always good to pay extra amen but in the last year so we've we've kind of opened that up and it's helped us so we went from uh 59 000 amen I mean not 59 but 69 and so now we owe the paper says and brother Brian hasn't made that December payment yet I guess after that it'll be around 19 000 somewhere in uh plus change but right now it's 20 600 or something I believe it is so that's a fifty thousand dollars I mean that we've gotten taking care of this year let's give the Lord a hand see thank you Lord Jesus praise the Lord amen and I got faith before next Christmas comes up that we'll be done with it amen I'm going to believe with me before next Christmas comes up we'll have a special services celebration service worship service praise God services and we'll get some uh some preacher in here and then we'll have some good Services amen amen to celebrate so God is good amen I certainly uh I guess the years passed so fast you know I never thought it would be you know I thought I might be 65 70 before we get it paid but I'm glad that it's going to be a lot earlier than that amen so praise the Lord God is good amen we love you all God is good amen and we're just looking for a good day in the Lord amen and so this is something we've heard before but you know I had to think about this when I thought thought about preaching things I've preached before and the thing about the word of God is it doesn't matter how many times you preach it it's still just as good as it ever was it's as true and it's it's up to date it's uh God stands behind his word and so never heard here hurts us to hear it again does it amen and so you just never know what God might do but I certainly uh I'm thankful to be a preacher amen amen I tell you what I don't believe that uh there's a greater calling amen it's certainly a whole lot better than being the president of the United States or uh the Prime Minister of England or some prime minister or or of some country or something because amen this is so so much greater I mean it's Eternal it's it it oh mine and you know the other day I was just looking up and for some reason sometimes in the fall you know those cow the clouds will all look like milky and just kind of flowing and up and down and Ripley almost looks like the ocean's up there right and I thought mine I looked at all of it and I said you know the Bible says you know I has not seen in neither has ear heard and can we even conceive what the the greatness of what heaven's going to be like amen it's going to be beautiful amen amen and I believe the power of God says there's no words to describe how beautiful it is over there and there's no words to describe how horrible hell is so how many's got an objective this morning that is I want to make Heaven I don't want to make hell I want to make Heaven amen and that's what we come to church for is to get our souls ready amen because uh you know Naturally Speaking we're all dead we're all dead it's just a matter of time you know right just a matter of time man we all have to go by the way of the grave but I'm so glad aren't you that that's not all there is [Laughter] Glory don't get me going there's so much more folks and the real Riches of this world is not the Natural Things the real riches is what Christ did on Calvary when he opened up his side you know and and the blood and the water came out true riches came out because he was pain amen for our way back to fellowship with almighty God Amen so praise be to God this morning amen let's not hold you up let's keep you standing too long we'll let you take it easy while I work ah turn your bibles if you will with me to Romans Romans we want to talk a little bit with the help of the Lord and we're going to be focusing little towards the black dog and the white dog is that okay Wednesday night we talked about how that you know uh God is the enable he makes it uh makes us makes it possible amen he enables us Amen to do whatever we need done even to move mountains and cast them in to the Sea amen he enabled Joshua to stop the Sun and the Moon and all of that amen so he could get the job done amen I don't know about you but I really don't like inability huh you can't do it no it can't be done I like when you tell me I can be done amen praise God and this morning we want to look at that and this is going to be a little bit more towards how that we can do it amen praise the Lord Romans 8 and 1 chapter I want a verse I want to read amen and I actually have a lot of reading I'd like to do but I don't know just how much I'm how much I'll do because Paul really really defines and really goes into detail and speaking of what we want to talk about in chapter 8 of Romans and we'll read verse 2. for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death amen for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen praise the Lord amen I want to talk about laws for a little bit now brother Bannon and every present water from The Rock Says at this rate now these things are controlled by laws amen by loss all of God's system is put up by laws amen now I was just back there studying and thinking you know uh you know because a lot of times we don't think the Bible and Grace uh and mercy as being a law we don't think of it that way so this is kind of a different way to look at it amen but yet even grace and mercy there's a lot to it isn't that right because we're because because one day God is going to judge the world isn't that right and he's going to judge it what does God what does a judge use to judge anybody with he uses the law he broke the law the law said this and you broke that law now you have to be judged so if there's a judgment day and God's going to be the judge and he's going to judge the World by Jesus Christ or by the Bible by the word and this whole thing is a law huh kind of new for you isn't it the whole thing's the law can I start with Mark 16 going into all the world and preach the gospel that every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned that's his law and on that day I mean even John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not be damned or condemned at the judgment amen but he that believeth not shall be damned amen shall be condemned so there's mercy and there's Grace there's Judgment of Grace there's eternal life for damnation right there and he'll say look did I send my son into the world so you wouldn't have to be to him but you have to believe and you refuse to believe therefore you get the last part of it so everything's controlled by the law even better than I'm talking about a couple quotes So if you want healing you have to work according to God's love no matter what you want we're all familiar with what brother random said about uh Michigan so forth but let me just bring a couple of these in here okay so I like that he says all of God's system is put here by laws no he says let's stop here for a minute let's take the world as it turns every 24 hours it makes a complete Revolution and he goes to talking about it to make a timepiece and to make a watch and that watch amen it may be ever so good but eventually it'll lose a second or two and after a while maybe a minute or two or it's so imperfect that it might begin to gain too many seconds ahead is that right it'll never be perfect but he does you talk about the Sun and the Moon and he talks about the galaxies the moon and the Haley's Comet and everything that comes around he says the tides coming in and out they know exactly when the moon's going up when the moon's going down when the Tide's coming in when the child's going out and they can give you a schedule over now because it's right on time guys whoa let me tell you something if you ever get caught up in the line of God and notice here what I just read did I say what the spirit is for free this is that even the spirit has a law to it for the law of the spirit has made me free from the law of sin and death [Music] that's right so it all has laws amen amen the moon going out amen it controls the tides and if that ever got messed up and the whole thing would come and so forth it never misses a tick hallelujah it's just perfect because it's running according to the law of God amen how many knows whenever God said let there be let there be let there be that was God creating a law let the moon be in this place let there be light and let it do its job oh my if we can ever get that way and get our lives and that's how many's with me do you know where no one you know what I'm saying if our lives would be so channeled into God's laws until he would just do whatever that holy spirit says whatever God says that's it just kicks perfectly I believe in the prophet of God comes to mind he says you know he'll pray but if God says you know quit this service and go over there he'll kill he'll tell the preach he'll says look I'm gone and I'm going over there because he just followed the Holy Spirit that's what you and I got to be amen oh my so many different things here oh my praise be to God now notice then he said he was standing there by Lake Michigan he was talking about the law of gravitation and he's seen all these Great Lakes all over the great lakes and he goes to describe in Arizona and the vast huge deserts just out there and he says you know you know if they would ever work according if they're ever going to water that they'd have to work according to the law of gravitation he said you could scream you can shout you can holler you can do whatever you want to but it's never going to get it there you gotta work according to the law of gravitation I mean there's a law of gravitation is a powerful thing you know they didn't just build things like the dams the Hoover dams allow water to just the flowing of water hello just the flowing of water to cause turbines and so forth to turn until the Hoover Dam I was meeting back there he talks about any supplies you know I don't know how old it is but it supplies the electricity for No Doubt factories and plants and everything else and for eight million people huh think about it talk about clean energy right amenities got powerful let me tell you something how many knows that the water of the word there's nothing to be emphasized greater than the washing of the Water by the way nothing like the word flowing through a church to keep it clean and to give it power oh my unlimited power how many knows every one of us is accessible to unlimited power even better man he's talking about power he says now the Holy Spirit here how many knows there's a law to this fourth dimension there's a law to radio waves and television waves and all of that so forth and I certainly don't know all the all the things there is to know about it I'm not sure if I may be rude yeah I've got one word perhaps that I could use as big and make me sound like I know something about it be a transmitter right and a different thing that are transmitted into different things that it's made out of so much copper and so forth everything has to be either just like the antenna you know what it's made out of and a certain kind of material I mean it's just all going to be a certain kind of material and the thing God where man came from huh where we come from that gas this is according to me which is not very reliable but I guess one of the first electronic things that we ever discovered was probably the telegraph huh I don't know about two but I'm thankful I can hear your voice you don't have to go tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap no that so many times means yes and someone accept me Noah and all that but Telegraph boy I'm excited to do how great he was and can't get the telegraph remember how great he was just to be believed that the just shall live by faith it's just a defeat place how much greater it was perhaps whenever the penny comes was coming along amen that the gift of speaking in tongues he had a greater portion of almighty God how many knows did you and I message Believers we're supposed to have a whole lot more than what the Pentecostals had we're supposed to be further down the road than what they were amen oh my Lord help us just open up I mean believe you just gotta have to we're going to have to just open up more amen let me just say this while it comes to mind if you're not where you are with God can I tell you what you do then you are going to have to do something different if you're not the kind of Christian you have to do something different I used to get up in the morning and I have my cup of coffee you know and I do this that and the other like to have my prayer before I go do things and so forth but this morning I got up you know what I'm saying and then I said listen I'm going to turn on Pandora put my old good old gospel music on there and and irritated my wife just a little bit because she don't like all of my music especially that everybody I met a superhero the world anyway but you know that just speaking that says you know I just want my atmosphere I got to thinking you know what the prophet of God says you know the birds when they get up in the morning when he said they begin to sing at the top of their voice and I thought you know if you got up and we got up every morning maybe that's where you need to stop where I need to start amen give God some Glory give him some praise get out there in the living room I thought maybe I need to get up here and dance around a little bit get mad just you know I'd have a lot less problem I feel a lot better today but if you're gonna get up every morning and you're going to be grumpy that's what your whole day's gonna be your gun will be nothing but a grump according to the laws of the flesh it's adopters it's mischievous it's lasciviousness it's malicious it's hateful it's variance it's emulation it's right it's right everything about you flash it ain't no good that black dog ain't no good and if you're under your flesh I want you to know that's what you're gonna be thank you and let me be a mean hungry contrary husband amen you won't be the kind of wife that you ought to be a husband I'm gonna be the kind of pass you out of me I ain't gonna be the kind of song of my dad and I'm gonna have that I need to be [Music] the law of the flesh there's the laws of the flesh according to Galatians amen [Music] it's just gonna be that way I certainly do certain things it's just gonna be that way you don't eat right you're not going to be healthy if you don't drink like the problem God says it's all love gravitational love you know of negligence if you're negligent you don't eat you don't turn the corner you're gonna wreck you don't eat pray spiritually you're gonna die what you think on it's what you eat it's a law amen many different laws praise the Lord no matter how he's talking about that desert no matter how dry it is they've proven that it's very fertile if it'll never get ground if it ever get water it'd be so fertile you could grow all the potatoes and he says you could actually feed the whole world if you'd ever get that right you'd feed the whole world have Surplus he said to throw into the sea well I don't know about you but I ain't much worried about the desert I'm worried about the deserts that tries to come into my heart that tries to come in here you're so dry you can't even scream you can't even say amen hallelujah Glory there's no joy there's no vegetation it's just a dry desert sometimes it's the way we feel Amen brother bottle preaching but it ain't got to be that way you ain't gonna be that way I ain't got to be that way there's water to swim man that I just wanted to dive into their story unspeakable and full of Glory you and I were made to come alive and be in Christ in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but most people live in hellish places in the devil huh oh my the law of radio you got to have the right receiver huh praise be to God how about spiritually people have no fellowship with almighty God because they haven't gotten a receiver yet didn't even put a man talking about the astronaut age and how that man there's got to be a link between that shovel amen and down here and that's the way it is it's you and I before we ever get anywhere we got to be linked to the to the heavens of Heavens you need a transmitter you need to know what channel with almighty God amen but there's certain laws and they found the laws foreign you know think get old to us but even brother bam talked about the laws of electricity isn't that right Benjamin Franklin and John Thomas Edison and how they were Benjamin Franklin he knew there was something there but Thomas Edison found what it was all about he went in his basement and he studied he's like this and he tried that tried this tried that had something in his mind I know I can do it huh how many here this morning oh I know I can be a better Christian I know I could have mother Holy Ghost I know I can have the power of God but how do I do it why don't you get down there and begin to study and say God I'm gonna figure this thing out amen and that's what we're doing a lot of times in our life huh are you just happy with your mediocre depressed life no I don't want no depressed life depression all these things oh my praise be to God radio law of atmosphere huh and probably God told us you know it doesn't matter it's supposed to be that you have a chicken that chicken's supposed to lay some eggs and it's supposed to sit on the mags and tell them little peeps hatch huh is that right and she's sitting there and sits there and sits there and fluffs out her feathers and fluffs out of feathers and make sure those ants are warm but we find out that the law of humidity in the law of temperature is actually what hatches him I don't care if you got it in an incubator me and my wife has a max the maniac out of the incubator why because that ain't get better and set to the right temperature it's gonna happen ain't about the right temperature that's the way it is we met in any church no wonder kids want to go out there in the world anymore there ain't no entertainment finding the holy spirit anymore no enthusiasm anymore if we're all just grabbed old man of crap you like that lost everything you'll get an entertainment like that everywhere mess up big time right

all frowny amen because you just got to overcome it one way or the other anyway who might as well not even let it bother you amen the law of atmosphere not like something else there's a law that said in the beginning let every seed rainfalls in its kind I like mother Brown brother Brian Sunday school lesson talking about you know you don't want to just be a hypocrite you can't just manufacture it it's got to be something good it's in you I want you to understand if you're a Son of God you can't help but be Son of God English gosh well I just can't help it [Music] it's just what I am but God

the earth you expect them to do what they do but I'm telling you what you expect Sons and Daughters to do different from them amen it's it's a law let every seed bring forth of its kind oh my if you were God's mind and if you got your name on the book do you reckon you're going to miss it [Music] no you're gonna be there if your name is not on the book are you gonna be there no you're not gonna

get it come on come on come on come and get it I'm not willing to that energy to perish he said do like your father and Alex try these best he does it to the whole world he did it to the Pharisees they don't want it no they don't want it man I'm here to tell you this ought to do something when you think that you want it there's something not in here that makes you want it more than anything else in the world this price couldn't hardly it should not be able to hold you your seat couldn't barely keep you down and that's God's grace that's God's mercy that you put something in you to believe with blessed are they that have to them shall be given but to them that have not dead will be taken even what they do have I didn't mean to get quite this excited I want to be more dignified I'll show you dignity when we get over to the other side it's going to sound like thunder you think it's noisy here you ain't seen nothing God wants his children happy he doesn't want you sad amen he wants you glad let us be blind and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come folks don't wait till get over there till you get glad you die I said huh depressed because of sin you probably won't be over there anyway yeah oh praise the Lord the law of the seed let it bring forth if it's kind Hallelujah there's another law that says you know that that hand that chicken can sit on those eggs and sit on them eggs and sit on them eggs what if they never hatch what if they never hatch can somebody tell me what the problem is thank you honey that's right brother says if she hadn't been with the male and with bait the man carries the germ of life isn't that right amen and with that German life ain't there it's just dead and rotten it is right you can crack it up it'll stink huh you can tell them all about God and His grace and his mercy and you can't get a squeak out of some folks huh just sit there dead what happens when that happens what do you do with all them eggs try again no but a man says well sometimes we have to clean out the nest let's get somebody that's been with the mail let me tell you something all these Hypocrites around people that have a profession but a confession but not a possession huh get rid of it you need something down on here folks that's the greatest thing you can have is something down in here praise the Lord let's talk about two things now we're gonna fix the go into the law of the of the Supreme buddy not right but first we want to talk about the law of sin the law of your flesh Paul describes it if you want to go with me in Romans and of course brother Bannon preached a message on what was it invisible Union of Christ in the bride out of Romans 7 1 through round four talking about how that a woman is bound to the law of her husband as long as he liveth but if that husband be dead she is freed from that law associate she can be married to another but if I'm goes to say it he says you know that there ain't no bride of Jesus Christ can be married to a man-made denomination to be the bride of Christ at the same time she has to be dick that the husband has to be dead to her is that right but we're going to pick it up a little bit further down if that'd be all right uh verse four wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should not be married that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead and that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which all were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law amen that being dead wherein ye were held we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter what shall we say is the law sin God forbid no if I had not known sin but I had not known sin but by the law for I had not known lust except the Lord said Thou shalt not covet but sin taking an occasion by the Commandment wrought in me all manner of conceptions now notice for without the law sin was dead let me ask you something it's the law holy it's the law righteous for I was the law I was alive verse nine I was alive without the law once why because if there's no law there's no sin isn't that right but when the Commandment came sin revived and I died and the Commandment which was to be unto death for sin taking the occasion by the Commandment deceived me and by its looming now just remember this that when Jesus Christ came he says I did not come to take away the law but I come to what magnify the law and many places in Matthew we won't have time to go into it this morning but he talks about you have heard that it's been said he has heard that he says I shall not commit a dog to you but I say unto you that whosoever look at the upon a woman Allah has already committed adultery in his heart and many other things he changed or whatever he magnified it and it made it stronger than what the Old Testament had it amen I want you to just try to understand something before we go on so that you'll understand it even better perhaps when we read it the law was to show you how sinful you are the law is Holy the law is righteous amen but we were Unholy and we were unrighteous and if you'll notice quickly for what the law could not do because it made wanted to make you whole and righteous didn't it the law wanted to make you whole and righteous don't commit adultery don't succeed don't go kill nobody huh all of these things that tried to make you do but he says it was weak through the flesh why because the king of Flesh couldn't do it it was asking of the flesh something it couldn't do that's why it killed you that's why it damned you all right let's go on all right deceive me and by it salute me wherefore the law is Holy and the Commandment holy and just and good sure and that good one that everything was good I shall love thy neighbor as thyself and so well that's all good but what do we do in this flesh we hate we love the neighborhood as it's good but let the neighbor do his bad and boy I'll tell you what that flesh really Rises up isn't that right sure was then that which is good made death unto me God forbid but sin that it might appear sin in other words he wanted to lie showed us how bad we were working death in Me by that which is good that sin by the Commandment might be exceedingly sinful for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin amen that's flesh remember that we're talking about the black lungs what about that flesh is so other sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do not but what I hate that I do the flesh is always working against your spirit always for then I do that which for then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good and I'm so what do you do what you're not supposed to do you're saying that the law is good but I'm bad amen for then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me in other words it's the flesh that does it for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good things for it to will is present with me but how to perform that which is I good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do I want you to understand something Paul is talking about when you're living in your flesh okay that's when you're that's when you're feeding the back black dog more for the good that I would I do not believe which I would not that I do for if I would do that which I would not it is no more I that do it but it's the flesh it's sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me y'all know the story of the Indian isn't that right how you doing or there's a black dog in me and a black dog amen which one wins if on your feet the most even Paul talking about being dead to sin and everything he says I have to die daily for a delight in the law of God after the enward man but I see a law in my members worrying against the law in my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death Hallelujah now notice the very next word Jesus began to thank God I thank God that through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin in other words if you go by your flesh you're going to law serve the law of sin but it's chapter eight it clears it all up Paul says there is there for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit how many glad for that for the law of the spirit of life of Jesus Christ has made me free from that other law Glory let me know that if you're under the law of the flesh you are going to be depressed you're going to be sad you're going to be defeated you're going to be deflated but the holy ghost sets you from that law amen oh are you ready this morning let's let's need a drive to New Orleans that's clinch it now notice made me free from the law of sin and death for what the lock could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and forcing condemned sin in the flesh so we see that how many knows it is only through Christ only by the baptism of the Holy Ghost only by the power will you overcome amen now notice that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in US huh that's right I mean is to the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in you you don't hate your brother anymore you don't call him a fool because the Bible says you're worthy of Hell Fire when you call your brother a fool Jesus said you know you have heard that it has been said I shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy something like that but he says I say until you love those that despitefully use you and so forth love your enemies do good hey man you couldn't do that before I mean you know you can't do that outside of the Holy Ghost your flesh automatically resents it hates amen but there's a law when you get the Holy Ghost s there's a lot it says and it makes you do something it makes you do it makes me love everybody makes me love everybody makes me love everybody it's good enough for me that's why I like that good old religion give me an old time Legend give me the old-time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it let's read some more all right for the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in US walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Hallelujah for they that are of the flesh after the flesh do mine the things of the flesh now come on Church how many knows but so that's probably where our problem is we still mind things too much of the flash it's why we're not having the victory that we should have in the spirit Realm [Applause] all right well not after the flesh but after the spirit for they don't have to deflect your mind the things of the flesh beginning after the spirit the things of the spirit for it to be carnally minded is death in other words if you got that kind of mind death lays there but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is imminently against God it is not subject to the law of God neither in the can be your hate for people and your love for me people can't dwell in the same place huh you're either hating them or you're loving them no white black bird well let me let me you know intermingle the spirit with the thoughts of the flesh they won't one has to be deader you're either think one or the other either had the mind of Christ or you're thinking fleshly thoughts so now notice because the carnal mind is enmity against God it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so than they that are in the flesh cannot please God I mean your flesh will never please God only that spirit amen not like this so the interface cannot be but with ye are not in the flesh boy you know if you take logic with that I'm still in the flesh I'm still here I'm still in the flesh no not really you're living in this body but if you're living according to this flesh and what it wants to do that's what Paul's saying then you're in a whole lot of trouble if you let your flesh get its way and do what he wants to do what will it bring forth it'll bring forth death every time that's because it's sin and the Paul said I'm free from the law of sin and death because if you sin Thou shalt surely die thank you law of sin is death amen but you are not either flesh but in the spirit you know I've been praying about in a series for this winter I thought about going back into Revelation back into Revelation series we've heard a lot of preachers talking about how uh you know how important Revelation is for us how many knows it's very very important Revelations you know how do you get Revelation from God amen by getting mad by cussing somebody out by being carnal by getting this gobble with your wife or your husband that don't help not does it no the only way that you get Revelation is by the spirit of God and then we won't go there another subjects now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his amen and if Christ be in you you the body is dead amen because of sin but the spirit is uh life because of righteousness let me go on down verse 12. therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh go die but if ye through the spirit mortify from what I understand that's clean cleanse mortified the Deeds of the body ye shall live amen for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Paul's glitter to the Galatians since chapter 5 verse 13 says for Brethren you have been called unto Liberty only use not your Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but look to but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you buy it and devour one another take heed that ye be not consume one of another this I say then walk in the spirit and he he shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh one amen amen huh isn't that the truth your black dog is never going to get the better if you're in the spirit like you ought to be amen praise be to God I'm supposed to be quitting but can I go further let's just go a little long this morning is that all right be sure to get up and jump a little bit and go like that it ain't gonna bother me I do it too all right you love him all right now notice all right I say this then walk in the spirit and he shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusts us against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to another isn't that right isn't that always a fight Black Dog white dog always fighting each other that you cannot do the things that you would huh but but if you are let by the spirit you Lord not under that law Ry I mean there's a flesh will ball get down the holy spirit will set you free I mean like some free here's the son has set free is free indeed hmm couldn't we stay on that for a while free from sin free from condemnation free from the blues free from free fearing of death free from being all of this so what is the law of the spirit the law of the spirit brings love into your heart it makes you love it brings faith and the law of faith in it is Invincible it conquers Giants it caught goliaths it kills all the Philistines the champion that Faith does there's a law in it amen that Spirit has a law to it makes you free amen but if you be led by the spirit ye are not under that law one more thought before we go to the comedian let's talk about a bird all right or let's go back a little bit human beings and how the Wright brothers they got that in their mind right they watch too many birds they thought they could fly huh how many people jumped off roofs and buildings and you know I remember being a young and dumb now that I'm not that I'm much smarter I'd like to take a medal and grab on a windy day and jump up huh dump up now can you imagine Mom and Daddy seeing your big old shock piece of metal jumping up in the air you know it's going to come right down the cross there and probably slit yourself but now the thoughts of jumping off of a roof or something or whatever huh we have it in our mind we want to fly and guess what we've realized that we could copy after the bird and said a couple wings and hey boy them funny first airplanes looked weird huh they were some boxy looking funny looking things but they had the right idea and look at where they are today up there in a big some jump boat air buses you know three three stories high hundreds and hundreds of people and taking up off the air and going from one country to the other and you know what what a great thing it was you know but guess what those airplane how many knows those airplanes have to be designed just the right way it's got to be the right aluminum it's got to be the right metal that they use a lightweight metal so it's not so heavy all these other everything about it now tell uh the undertale runner and the flaps on the back and the slaps on the side everything has to be right it's got to be made one is made right it can fly can I say something in the morning when you're made right you can fly when I think about helpless what are you made of is my question what are we made of [Music] yeah when God made a bird he made him a certain way didn't he their bodies are kind of slim isn't that right in their feathers from what I understand the prophet of God says try to pull a feather out of a big old Eagle one time you can't do it with a pair of pliers hardly you can't hardly pull their feathers out they're stuck in their wings so hard God puts a certain thing around that Wing to make sure that it don't it don't break then it don't come loose either not not come loose easy amen and I'll tell you what day them they're made for it they made a certain way to set their wings and men out there like you can Swatch them up there a minute their wings will be going like that a little bit and their tail a little bit like that and they're never fought them they just sailing they set their wings and go higher how many knows that you and I are supposed to be equals higher they go above the sound of the noise of the car the sound of the coming drama of all these other stuff say well you ain't no son of God you ain't never gonna make it get up higher hey man like brother bam says when he seen that one Eagle down because he had gotten down too low and he got in there storming that storm took him down into the Timbers right he got his feathers all wet but he was using the law for warmth the law of the Sun and he was drawing them feathers aren't you glad that when you do get down by a big old storm of some kind there's a place that you can go amen there's an atmosphere that you can go into on your knees and say God I need an alarm set I need a little Lefty up like David when they were watching the song and Batman begin to lift him up he wasn't scared of nothing all right you got to be scared to have even death and then we let our little trials upset us so bad how many believe eagles need to be setting their wings we have two we've been given Wings of Faith and that law is to bring you up take you up over all of that I want to jump on top of this Pulpit so bad when I think about you you church and God the things that he has taught you I hope everybody in here has got this that you learned how to handle the problems that come your way how did you have learned to set your wings right like that I'm setting my wings Lord I'm committing it to you lord it's your problem I can't handle it so God I'm putting it to you each and every one of us has to learn to commit it to God oh I'm just going to say it because it comes to mind because I've seen people try to handle things carnally make things running into church the way they think carnaling it ain't nothing but a massive catastrophe complete and total failure it has to be God doing it amen oh my uh to me a church that Scott that learned has learned how to set their wings in a faith in God and rise above the trials and go up on high go into the laws of God laws of the spirit on your knees amen and go climb higher than all these things astronauts come way up there amen praise be to God but sometimes we're still down here with the chickens pecking around with little issues nobody loves me you didn't shake my hand quit pecking and with the chickens go over there and give that brother a big dead sister a big old hug and say God bless you how are you doing amen Lord help me don't blame anybody else for anything that happens to you huh somebody does something that you don't like guess what God gave you ten toes and two Good Feet you can just walk away it's you Glory aren't you glad I'm really can't take the we can't put the blame on everybody also no you create your own world and live on it hey man you're gonna you're gonna create your own world folks make your decisions do the right thing I learned that when I was 18 20 years ago 28 30 18 20 to 20 years old can't even talk anymore hardly Lord help me not to look or rely on anybody else God I'm relying on you I'm committing my life to you and what you do with me is what you want to do and here he has me for the last 30 years folks I'd want to do what God wants me to do and if you don't like it then get out of my way [Laughter] cause I'm gonna do what God wants me to do don't you feel that way I'ma serve God no matter how many you don't want to go no my brother don't want to go that stone into me says you

spirit I mean he's with me God bless you stand with me we'll stop right there thank you all for your prayers because I believe it's your prayers that I feel when I go and sit by my desk and I bow my

prayers God's heard he knows what you have need of when I get down there and say Lord Jesus these are your sheep you've ordained me to be here and be the shepherd God now I ask you to come and feed the sheep amen has the Lord fed you this morning do you believe that's the truth I believe that's the truth amen let's bow our heads how many needs to do something different raise your hands I need to do something different God bless you Maybe it's praying more when you get up maybe it's playing more gospel music to bring an atmosphere about yourself maybe it's I don't know but you figured it out what you got to do what you got to change to make you a better Christian than what you are quite get you to climb higher above the cares of the world above caring more about your physical and financial needs that you don't need that as much as you do the spirit that that becomes secondary Lord Jesus you see the hands all over the building my hand is up I need to do things different and I raise my hands from this point on God I promise you with the with your help I will climb into your spirit more and I will think about you more Lord I'll do all the things that the spirit once done instead of what this flesh does I want to starve the black dog I want this flesh to be dead not alive but dead I want the spirit to have Liberty and life and bring joy and faith and Power God that's the harsh desire of everyone that has raised their hands and I thank you for a group of people like this Lord my brothers and my sisters whom I love dearly Lord and such a joy when I was coming to church this morning to think oh we get the fellowship together again Lord we get to come into worship you what a great honor who in the world wouldn't want to do this lord it's such an honor to come
