[17:10] Brother Ed Wardrobe, would you come up
[17:12] and open up service in prayer for us?
[17:14] Amen. We'd appreciate it. I know you
[17:16] holding that grandbaby. That's precious
[17:18] stuff right there. But Amen. God bless
[17:21] you. Let's stand tonight and Amen. And
[17:23] we'll just go before the Lord in prayer.
[17:25] And Amen. We just appreciate everybody
[17:28] that could stay over. Amen. So, God
[17:30] bless you. How many's looking forward to
[17:31] good time in the Lord?
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Edward.
[17:36] Amen. You, too. Amen. Let's pray.
[17:41] Our heavenly father, Lord God, how
[17:43] wonderful
[17:44] it is for the brother to abide. Is that
[17:48] like anointing oil that run by Aaron's
[17:50] spear, Lord Jesus.
[17:53] Thank you, Father. and above all your
[17:54] presence Lord Jesus because your prophet
[17:57] has taught us Lord Jesus that the spirit
[17:59] of the Lord is on the house of God in
[18:02] the church Lord Jesus and you are here
[18:05] heavenly father after that wonderful
[18:07] sermon this morning Lord Jesus
[18:10] and then that good eating Lord Jesus
[18:12] we're thirsty and hungry again Lord God
[18:15] for your word more than anything else
[18:17] Lord Jesus because men shall not live by
[18:21] bread alone but by the word of the for
[18:24] every word that comes out of the mouth
[18:26] of God, Lord Jesus. So that's what we
[18:28] expect in here, Lord God, to be fed
[18:30] again, Lord Jesus, by your word, Lord
[18:32] God. Let it every song, every
[18:35] note that we play, Lord God, be for your
[18:38] glory. May you hear and may you receive
[18:40] it, Lord Jesus. May you receive our
[18:43] worship, Lord God. As I was thinking the
[18:45] other day, Father, that we were created
[18:48] to worship you, Lord Jesus, and even thy
[18:51] prophet. It has declared Lord God that
[18:53] the angels will circle the air Lord
[18:55] Jesus and they will bow down their
[18:57] hearts because they don't understand to
[19:00] be lost Lord God but we understand what
[19:03] is to be lost Lord Jesus and what is to
[19:05] be found Lord God. So even before that
[19:07] happens Lord God when we come to your
[19:10] precious like the brother had seen in
[19:11] the morning Lord Jesus that he wanted a
[19:14] mansion right next to you father you
[19:17] went to prepare a place Lord Jesus while
[19:19] you come Lord God receive our our praise
[19:22] and adoration Lord God may everything to
[19:25] be done and say this afternoon Lord God
[19:27] before your glory Lord God and I pray
[19:30] that you come amongst your people in the
[19:33] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Appreciate it. Amen.
[19:47] [Music]

[19:56] talk about Jesus.

[33:25] They that wait upon the Lord, they shall
[33:30] renew
[33:32] their strength.
[33:35] They shall mount up with wings
[33:40] as eagles.

[33:50] They shall walk and not faint. And teach

[34:24] Keep my faith
[34:27] renewed
[34:29] and keep my eyes on thee.
[34:34] Let me be
[34:37] on this earth what you want me to be.
[34:44] Oh, they that wait upon the Lord, they
[34:49] shall renew
[34:51] their strength.
[34:54] They shall mount up with wings
[34:59] as eagles.
[35:03] And they shall run and not be weery.
[35:09] They shall walk and not faint.
[35:14] Teach me Lord.
[35:16] Teach me Lord
[35:18] to wait.
[35:21] [Music]
[35:34] So, I just wanted to tell a little bit
[35:36] of my testimony. Um, as you know, me and
[35:39] Caleb were just blessed with um, our
[35:43] miracle and we are very excited and we
[35:46] just thank you all for all your prayers.
[35:49] Um, a little bit I just wanted to say a
[35:52] little bit about the testimony. I can't
[35:54] say everything because there's just too
[35:56] much God has done for us honestly during
[35:58] this time. Um, but I did find a quote
[36:01] from brother Brandham and in one of her
[36:04] his sermons he said, "Faith is substance
[36:06] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[36:08] things I do not see." See what I mean?
[36:11] Here in my pocket, I think there's an
[36:13] old barlo knife I've carried for years
[36:15] now. I do not see that knife. I do not
[36:17] feel that knife. I do not taste that
[36:19] knife. I do not smell that knife, but I
[36:21] know that knife is in there. How do you
[36:23] know? Because I believe it's in there.
[36:25] Now, if it is not in there, faith will
[36:28] put it in there. if it's not there. And
[36:30] that's exactly what God did for Caleb
[36:33] and I. We may have not been able to see
[36:35] things, but we had faith and believe God
[36:38] would do it and he did. And we've been
[36:42] um it's been about a year now and we had
[36:45] kept believing and I had some problems
[36:48] and um just in my body that needed to be
[36:51] healed and they would cause
[36:53] complications, but I wasn't going to let
[36:56] that get in the way of my promise. And
[36:58] during the time of waiting, we had been
[37:00] given so many confirmations just from
[37:03] all kinds of just different things.
[37:05] People have talked to us and um sent
[37:08] scriptures to me and didn't even know we
[37:10] were praying for a child at the time.
[37:11] And they uh they were just wonderful.
[37:14] And we also had meetings in May and um
[37:17] we all had been up at the altar when um
[37:20] brother Timothy Puit, he just comes out
[37:23] and says, "I believe we're in an
[37:24] atmosphere that a mama can ask for a
[37:26] daughter, ask for a son." and it'll
[37:28] happen. And that can mean anything to
[37:30] anybody, but I just know that God was
[37:32] telling me and he was just telling me to
[37:35] keep leaving and it would happen. I had
[37:38] felt led to go ahead and start building
[37:40] a nursery over time and little by
[37:43] little, we just bought little things
[37:45] here and there and I just kept claiming
[37:47] our miracle. And in those same meetings,
[37:49] Brother Andrew Spencer prayed for us as
[37:51] well through the prayer line. And later
[37:54] on, I I believe it was brother Tommy
[37:56] that sent Caleb a message and said, um,
[37:59] "Send me the test once you get the
[38:00] positive report and mention Andrew
[38:03] Spencer's wife said that the the Lord
[38:05] moved on her while Caleb and I were
[38:07] being prayed for and said that he had
[38:09] expectation of powerhouse testimony."
[38:12] Well, I'm here today saying that God did
[38:15] it and and he is the same yesterday,
[38:18] today, and forever because he did give
[38:20] us this miracle. And um after the
[38:23] meetings and just throughout the year,
[38:25] my faith was constantly being tested.
[38:28] There had been times the devil would try
[38:29] to come in and just with lies and
[38:32] spirits of doubt and fear. But even
[38:36] then, I knew that with God all things
[38:38] were possible when we believe.
[38:40] And so we we continued to believe. And
[38:44] um another thing just randomly out of it
[38:48] came to me around like 11:30 one night
[38:50] and I kept hearing a scripture over and
[38:52] over and I had been trying to just fall
[38:54] asleep and it just was not happening and
[38:57] I was like well what is this and it was
[38:59] out of Thessalonians 3:10 and it it said
[39:02] night and day praying exceedingly that
[39:04] we might see your face and might perfect
[39:06] that which is lacking in your faith. And
[39:09] of course during this time I was, you
[39:11] know, dealing with the the spirit of
[39:14] fear and just just different things the
[39:16] devil wanted to torment me with. And I
[39:18] just I knew I wanted to be the best
[39:20] Christian I could be before I became a
[39:23] mother. And I just heard it heard the
[39:26] scripture and I was like, "Oh, I think
[39:27] that's God reminding me to just stay in
[39:29] his word." And he wants to fellowship
[39:32] with us day and night. And I just needed
[39:35] to keep reading his word, keep praying.
[39:37] And I know that as long as I kept
[39:40] believing that it would happen and I
[39:42] didn't want to be lacking in anything to
[39:44] receive the promise and I just wanted
[39:47] all the faith that I could just as a
[39:49] mother but not just as a mother but as a
[39:51] believer as well. And then about four
[39:55] weeks ago or so, Sister Donna texted me
[39:58] and she sent me a message. she got uh
[40:01] she was up there in the Virginia
[40:02] meetings and she had just texted me
[40:05] saying that she she believed that the
[40:07] Lord was going to bless us with little
[40:09] ones and um she stood up for us in
[40:12] prayer and I guess Austin uh Westerman
[40:15] as well did that too and um and then of
[40:19] course just a little bit after that it
[40:21] was um like two I think it was two weeks
[40:24] after that we took a test that I had I
[40:28] had been taking over and over. Nothing
[40:30] came back positive. It was just all
[40:32] negative and it was making me worry
[40:34] about different things I had going on.
[40:37] And um and then all of a sudden the
[40:40] first one came back positive. And
[40:42] exactly a week from then um that's when
[40:46] h that the test came back positive and
[40:49] that's when we knew that our miracle had
[40:51] come and that that's what God we seen
[40:54] that God did it and he had healed me
[40:57] from everything that that I had asked of
[41:00] him.
[41:04] [Applause]
[41:10] So, I just wanted to say that our
[41:11] testimony shows that you can ask
[41:14] absolutely anything. And as long as you
[41:16] stay with the word, have faith and
[41:17] believe and fight through all the
[41:19] devil's lies, God will make it happen.
[41:22] If he can do it for me and Caleb, then
[41:24] he can do it all the more for anyone who
[41:26] needs any healing or an answered prayer.
[41:30] [Applause]
[41:38] I just wanted to sing this song just
[41:39] saying how awesome God is.
[41:43] [Music]
[42:13] You call the sun to rise.
[42:20] You lay it down to rest.
[42:27] You hold this heart of mine.
[42:34] You hold my every breath. Such an
[42:39] awesome God. So mighty,
[42:45] so holy,
[42:48] so wonderful,
[42:52] such an awesome God, so selfless,
[42:58] so generous,
[43:02] so faithful. You are
[43:06] [Music]
[43:08] seated in majesty,
[43:14] reigning in holyness.
[43:20] The table is set for me.
[43:27] For you are the living
[43:31] breast. Such an awesome
[43:34] God so mighty,
[43:38] so holy,
[43:41] so wonderful,
[43:44] such an awesome God. So selfless,
[43:51] so generous,
[43:54] so faithful you are.
[43:59] And nothing comes close to the Lord
[44:04] Almighty.
[44:06] Nothing as sweet as his love and mercy.

[55:33] We're going up. We are the church.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Not this building's going up. You and me
[55:38] are going up.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you, he said, "This earthly
[55:42] tabernacle dissolved. We have one
[55:44] awaiting." I was preaching my
[55:46] father-in-law's sermon or his last I
[55:49] guess sermon. It's he passed away a few
[55:51] weeks ago and
[55:53] I preached his last uh victory sermon
[55:56] and you know he asked me to preach
[55:58] almost 20 years ago at his at his church
[56:00] my father-in-law and when I came into
[56:03] the message and I never thought I would
[56:05] preach his last victory message and um I
[56:09] just thought about how we all as we get
[56:12] older we're all going to cross that
[56:14] line. You know, there's a time and a
[56:15] place that we're po pointed to to to
[56:18] pass away or move forward. But aren't
[56:21] you glad that we have a promise
[56:23] &gt;&gt; that he said that this old tabernacle
[56:25] those we have one awaiting. That's the
[56:27] that's the one I'm searching for. That
[56:29] should be the one you're searching for.
[56:31] No more aches and pains,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; no more taxes.
[56:36] It's going to be a glorious day. I tell
[56:38] you, brother Brand went behind the
[56:40] curtain of time. Aren't you thankful for
[56:41] a prophet that could go behind the
[56:42] curtain of time and and tell you not to
[56:44] miss it for anything.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Not to miss this for anything. I,
[56:48] brother Ber, I don't want to miss it. I
[56:50] I I want to make heaven my home. I
[56:53] really do. May God bless you tonight.
[56:55] God bless you, Rachel. That song I'm
[56:59] only in this message.

[58:27] Anyway,
[58:30] I am holy
[58:33] in this message.
[58:35] Oh, sing it tonight.
[58:38] Oh, if you're thankful tonight, let's
[58:40] worship him. I'm only
[58:44] this message
[58:47] by grace.
[58:52] It's only
[58:54] by grace
[58:57] that I'm in this place.
[59:02] I don't know why
[59:05] my God chose me, but I'm thankful
[59:11] anyway.
[59:14] I am only
[59:16] in this message
[59:19] by grace.
[59:22] Oh father, we love you tonight,
[59:25] God. We didn't choose you. Father, you
[59:27] chose us from the foundation of the
[59:29] world,
[59:31] God, that grace came through our door.
[59:34] Father, we're thankful tonight to know
[59:37] you, Lord, to know the truth, to know
[59:40] the word, but God, to be living epistles
[59:43] read of all men tonight.
[59:46] God, I ask you would just energize the
[59:48] word. May it come across and may it just
[59:52] become not just letters on a page, but
[59:55] may it become reality in our life. May
[59:57] it may it give us gaze to serve you
[1:00:00] through the week, God. May it just not
[1:00:02] be another just church service, but God,
[1:00:04] may we may we get something from it,
[1:00:07] Lord.
[1:00:08] Speak to us in your way tonight. This
[1:00:11] grace, Father, we love you. We give you
[1:00:13] all the praise, the glory. We're not
[1:00:15] here to please men. Father, we're here
[1:00:16] to please you, Lord. May you speak,
[1:00:19] Father, in a mighty way tonight. We love
[1:00:22] you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God
[1:00:26] bless you tonight. God bless you
[1:00:28] musicians. And God bless you, brother
[1:00:30] Ber. We're just so honored to be here. I
[1:00:33] I was telling the boys, I was like,
[1:00:34] "Man, y'all were knee high to a
[1:00:35] grasshopper last time we came. Now
[1:00:37] you're really tall." So, but I'm I'm so
[1:00:41] thankful. I I I'm just thankful that
[1:00:44] over 20some years ago, I I surrendered
[1:00:46] my life to Jesus Christ. And most of
[1:00:49] all, I I came in contact with the word
[1:00:51] of message of the hour. And my life
[1:00:54] hadn't been the same. The book hadn't
[1:00:56] been the same. It's opened up. You know,
[1:00:58] you wouldn't know what happened in the
[1:00:59] garden. You wouldn't know about the
[1:01:01] water, you know, through the water
[1:01:02] baptism. I know brother Bram says in one
[1:01:04] place that you don't need revelation for
[1:01:06] water baptism. But I'm thankful that we
[1:01:08] know it's in his name. And I'm thankful
[1:01:10] that we don't have to baptize in, you
[1:01:12] know, all these names and father, son,
[1:01:15] hol, you know, all these father, son,
[1:01:16] holy ghost. And I'm thankful that we
[1:01:18] have the truth.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; We live in a day that it's it's a
[1:01:22] confused world. But I'm here to tell
[1:01:24] you, I we got the truth. It should set
[1:01:26] you free tonight.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; You should be the happiest people
[1:01:29] tonight that you got the truth. Let's
[1:01:31] just turn to him. Uh turn to First Kings
[1:01:33] 21. A little different thought tonight.
[1:01:36] First Kings 21. I give you a minute to
[1:01:38] get there. First Kings 21. May God bless
[1:01:41] you. I just pray God will just open our
[1:01:44] eyes and and give us Brother Bram says,
[1:01:46] "Play for revelation more than
[1:01:47] anything." And that's what I pray for
[1:01:49] every day. So first kings 21 verse one
[1:01:54] this is talking about na nabal's
[1:01:56] vineyard and it says it came to pass
[1:01:58] after these things that Nabal the
[1:02:00] Jezraelite and the vineyard which was in
[1:02:04] Jezrael
[1:02:05] hard by the palace of Ahab king of
[1:02:08] Samaria and Ahab spake unto Naob saying
[1:02:11] give me thy vineyard that I may have it
[1:02:13] for a garden of herbs because it is near
[1:02:16] unto my house. And he goes on to say he
[1:02:20] says u verse verse uh right here for
[1:02:23] near unto my house we're still in verse
[1:02:24] two and it says and I will give thee for
[1:02:27] a better vineyard than it or if it seem
[1:02:30] good to thee I will give thee the worth
[1:02:32] of it in money and so and naob nab said
[1:02:36] unto Ahab the Lord forbid it to me that
[1:02:39] I should give my inheritance of my
[1:02:40] fathers unto thee. And Ahab came into
[1:02:43] his house heavy and dis displeased
[1:02:46] because of the word which Nahab and
[1:02:48] Jezerite Jezerite had spoken of for him
[1:02:51] to him. For he had said, I will not give
[1:02:54] thee thy inheritance of my fathers. And
[1:02:57] he had laid down upon his bed and turned
[1:03:00] his face and would not eat bread. And
[1:03:02] but Jezebel his wife came to him and
[1:03:05] said unto him, why is that spirit so sad
[1:03:08] and thou eatest no bread? And he said
[1:03:10] unto her, because I have spoken to Dhab
[1:03:13] the Jezraelite, and said unto him, give
[1:03:15] me thy vineyard for money, or else or if
[1:03:18] it pleased thee, I will give thee
[1:03:19] another vineyard. And he answered, I
[1:03:21] will not give thee thy my vineyard. May
[1:03:24] God bless, may God add his blessings to
[1:03:26] his word. I just want to speak a few
[1:03:28] minutes. I just wrote this down. Uh just
[1:03:31] this might sound like an odd topic, but
[1:03:34] I just thought about Nahhab and his and
[1:03:36] his vineyard. And you know, I just want
[1:03:38] to speak on a topic that your vineyard
[1:03:39] is not for sale.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; That we live in a day and hour that that
[1:03:44] we live in a day and hour that here we
[1:03:46] are in this late hour. No one thought we
[1:03:49] would be this far along. No one thought
[1:03:51] we would we would even get here. But
[1:03:53] there's still someone out there. He's
[1:03:55] waiting to come in. It could be in this
[1:03:57] church. It could be wherever. But I
[1:03:59] thought about Nahhab. What he said in
[1:04:01] this I I thought it was outstanding. But
[1:04:03] the prophet of God, he would go to say,
[1:04:05] he said, "Now, so Jezebel, when she when
[1:04:08] she comes over here, little husband, one
[1:04:11] day, she's got kind of upset because
[1:04:13] that man wouldn't break the tradition of
[1:04:16] God."
[1:04:17] He said, "And the laws of God," he said,
[1:04:20] he says that the laws of God to to let
[1:04:22] him have this place because the law
[1:04:25] said, he said, "Because the law said
[1:04:27] that he should keep his heritage and it
[1:04:30] be handed down to Nabal." The prophet of
[1:04:32] God says, "But then when he when we find
[1:04:34] out that he wouldn't do it, Ahab began
[1:04:37] to pine and running and fell across the
[1:04:40] bed and that little little Jezebel the
[1:04:43] little butterfly came and got him up and
[1:04:46] laid up up up in his upper in her lap
[1:04:48] and he said, "Now dear, what's wrong
[1:04:51] with you?" And the prophet of God said,
[1:04:52] "Oh, Nabal wouldn't let me have his
[1:04:55] vineyard." She said, "Oh, don't worry.
[1:04:56] I'll get it for you. Who's the ruler of
[1:04:59] this kingdom anyhow?"
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. And I believe that's the
[1:05:03] way we're living today. That that that
[1:05:05] we had the message of the hour. He had
[1:05:07] the word open before us. You have a
[1:05:09] great vineyard today. You had the word
[1:05:12] of God revealed in your hour that the
[1:05:14] world wants to tell you, "Come on over
[1:05:16] here. There's better pleasure." Uh the
[1:05:19] the the devil wants to tell you, "Hey,
[1:05:20] leave the message of the hour. Go over
[1:05:22] here." But there's nothing better than
[1:05:24] this vineyard. There's nothing better
[1:05:26] than the vineyard that God has laid
[1:05:28] before us, me and you, today. He's gave
[1:05:31] you the best vineyard. He's gave you the
[1:05:33] best of the word of the hour. He's He
[1:05:36] might You might not say, "My bank
[1:05:37] account shows it tonight." But I'm here
[1:05:39] to tell you, your heavenly account shows
[1:05:41] it tonight. You have a better vineyard.
[1:05:44] You have the best vineyard you could
[1:05:46] have. And I It's just It's just kind of
[1:05:48] funny, brother, the way brother brings
[1:05:50] it out. He says, "See that she puts me
[1:05:52] like in the mind of denominational
[1:05:54] barriers. See, I'll get it for you." He
[1:05:57] said, "You just let me have it that my
[1:05:59] way and I'll get it." and she stomped
[1:06:01] her little foot and ran out there and
[1:06:03] she got some more guys and what kind of
[1:06:06] backsliders went over there to set up a
[1:06:08] a false uh accuse against Nabal and he
[1:06:12] had he had him stoned. And you see how
[1:06:14] the devil, he knows the truth. He knows
[1:06:17] what you were believing. Young people,
[1:06:19] he knows that this is the absolute
[1:06:21] truth. He knows that the message of the
[1:06:23] hour is has exposed him from Genesis to
[1:06:26] Revelation. It tells the beginning and
[1:06:29] it tells the end and it tells the devil
[1:06:31] where he's going.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; And the devil is after every family.
[1:06:35] He's after your vineyard. He's after
[1:06:37] your home. He's after everything he can
[1:06:40] get out. He is it's he's he's at work.
[1:06:43] He says he's at he's the accuser of thy
[1:06:45] brother. He said day and night. If you
[1:06:48] read the scripture, it says the devil is
[1:06:50] after us day and night. He's working
[1:06:53] every single day going to God back and
[1:06:55] forth. Hey, did you know Isaac did this?
[1:06:57] Did you know they did this? And God
[1:06:59] says, "Hey, I paid the price. My blood
[1:07:01] shed on Calvary. I paid the price." The
[1:07:03] devil says, "Hey, do you know they made
[1:07:04] a mistake?" Well, guess what? They asked
[1:07:06] for forgiveness. I paid the price. It is
[1:07:08] a paid work at Calvary for every sin
[1:07:11] that you'll commit tomorrow and then you
[1:07:13] committed in your past. It's a The cross
[1:07:16] is a three-dimensional cross. It's for
[1:07:18] your past. It's for your tomorrow. And
[1:07:20] it's for your present. It's a cross that
[1:07:23] presses all sin, everything that you've
[1:07:26] committed. Young people, if you made a
[1:07:28] sin, make it right and move on.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Don't live in that. The devil wants to
[1:07:34] make you live in a state of fear and
[1:07:37] anxiety. I've never seen so much anxiety
[1:07:40] between the young people and the the uh
[1:07:43] I want to I want to cut myself. I don't
[1:07:45] know why I'm saying it. I want to do
[1:07:46] this. I want there. I want because
[1:07:48] anxiety is in the land. They want to
[1:07:51] keep you the devil wants to keep you
[1:07:53] busy. say, "Hey, there's a better. Hey,
[1:07:55] this is church is better. This boy I
[1:07:57] date is better. But I'm here to tell
[1:07:59] you, you've got the best vineyard." You
[1:08:01] have the revelation of the hour.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; You have the revelation of the hour
[1:08:07] today. He said, "But remember, when such
[1:08:10] sin is that goes on among the people,
[1:08:13] God's always got somebody that'll stand
[1:08:16] out and tell them about it."
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen." Yes, sir. He had a a a
[1:08:22] Tishbite named by the name of Elijah.
[1:08:25] Aren't you glad that we had a prophet of
[1:08:26] our day and he would stand and preach
[1:08:29] the word. He would bring the word. He
[1:08:31] didn't have a whole lot of money, but he
[1:08:33] didn't care about the money. He cared
[1:08:34] about souls. And that's where you should
[1:08:37] be. Every one of us should be going, I
[1:08:39] want to get another soul into the
[1:08:41] kingdom of God.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; We should all, no matter who you are,
[1:08:45] preacher or not, we should all be
[1:08:47] striving in the same direction.
[1:08:50] But it seems like a lot of us will have
[1:08:52] our vineyard set up and we'll plow all
[1:08:55] day and we'll believe the message of the
[1:08:57] hour and then someone come up to you in
[1:08:59] the message. Well, didn't they say this
[1:09:02] and didn't he say that or take the
[1:09:04] prophet's word out of contents or hey,
[1:09:06] well, we don't really need to go to
[1:09:07] church. No. When brother Rabbit says
[1:09:09] when them doors are open, you Christian
[1:09:11] cannot miss a church service.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; I tell you why. I I believe people are
[1:09:17] hearing some other different things and
[1:09:19] this and that and I'm here to tell you
[1:09:21] the Bible says as the days are
[1:09:23] approaching
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; more so we should be coming to the house
[1:09:27] of God.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; I tell you why we should be protecting
[1:09:30] our vineyard. I'm here to tell you to
[1:09:32] tell you saints that we should protect
[1:09:34] our vineyard, our home. What God has
[1:09:37] gave you what God your business
[1:09:39] everything you got give it back to God.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Protect your home front. Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; But too many times we don't have
[1:09:47] backbones that stand up and stand up for
[1:09:50] our families and say, "Hey, I that's my
[1:09:52] family.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; For me in my house, we're going to serve
[1:09:55] God. If everybody leaves this message of
[1:09:57] the hour, we're going to stand strong,
[1:09:59] boys. And we're the only ones standing,
[1:10:02] brother Ber. We're me and you are going
[1:10:04] to be the only ones standing."
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; That's what we got to do. We got to
[1:10:08] believe it with everything that's within
[1:10:10] us. It can't be a head knowledge
[1:10:11] anymore. It's got to be revelation. It's
[1:10:14] got to go from the head down to the
[1:10:16] heart. And it's got to be something you
[1:10:19] live.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; It's got to be a daily walk. Not just,
[1:10:22] "Well, Brother Chris, the young people,
[1:10:25] well, I I kind of understand it." No.
[1:10:27] Let God say, "God, I pray you open up my
[1:10:30] eyes.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Open up my eyes." It's like all the when
[1:10:35] they saw all the all the chariots and he
[1:10:37] said, "Hey, open up his eyes." I tell
[1:10:40] you maybe maybe one of you say tonight
[1:10:42] say Lord I want to see the truth. I want
[1:10:45] to have more revelation than I had ever
[1:10:47] in any day. I want to oh you open my
[1:10:49] eyes more every day. I ask God every day
[1:10:52] Lord as I read your word be let it
[1:10:54] become real to me.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Let it become real to me. It's like my
[1:10:59] wife she can write me a letter or write
[1:11:00] me a card. I can read in between it and
[1:11:02] understand what she's trying to say. She
[1:11:04] write a paragraph and you can read in
[1:11:06] between the lines. That's what God has
[1:11:08] wrote this word of God for us that we
[1:11:10] can read in between. It's a love letter
[1:11:12] to the bride tonight to say, "Hey, wake
[1:11:15] up. It's time to keep marching on. It's
[1:11:18] time to press on. It's not a time to
[1:11:20] sleep. It's not a time to just sit back
[1:11:22] and relax. It's a time to go all the
[1:11:25] way.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Give it your all."
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; I like what Jezel, he said there, right
[1:11:31] here. I thought this was interesting. It
[1:11:34] says in verse one of 2 First Kings 21,
[1:11:37] it said, "It came to pass after these
[1:11:39] things that Nabal and the Jezerite had a
[1:11:41] vineyard." I thought this is very
[1:11:43] interesting. It might be simple, but I
[1:11:44] thought it was good. Which was in
[1:11:46] Jezarel. And I looked that word Jezarel
[1:11:48] up. And I thought if I could find it
[1:11:51] here, it says that Jezel, the meaning of
[1:11:54] Jezrael, it says God sws or God will
[1:11:58] sow. It's a from the Hebrew word the
[1:12:00] root zera meaning zora meaning the to
[1:12:04] sew or plant the meaning of of God. It's
[1:12:07] it's it's talking about sewing uh it's a
[1:12:10] place it's a place of sewing. And I'm
[1:12:12] here to tell you young people old people
[1:12:14] alike middle age we got to do something.
[1:12:18] You got to work to do. We got to sew for
[1:12:20] the kingdom of God. It ain't just sit
[1:12:22] back and oh read one scripture or do
[1:12:24] this. But you are God's hands. You are
[1:12:27] God's mouth. You're God's feet tonight
[1:12:30] and you got to do something. And that if
[1:12:32] that's giving your tithes, just helping
[1:12:34] the church, whatever it is, send in a
[1:12:36] letter to somebody. Say, "Hey, I haven't
[1:12:38] seen you in a while at church. I just
[1:12:40] want to encourage you.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Sending some flowers." I tell you,
[1:12:44] brother said, "When they're in the
[1:12:45] ditch, pick them up. Don't talk about
[1:12:47] them."
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's a lot of people in
[1:12:50] this message will come against this
[1:12:51] person. Come. I'm like, "You don't
[1:12:52] listen to your tapes.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; You don't read your Bible.
[1:12:58] I mean, it just it's outstanding. And it
[1:13:00] shows some of the ignorance in some of
[1:13:02] the people because they really don't
[1:13:04] listen. They they push play, but they
[1:13:06] don't obey.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm just it's not in my notes.
[1:13:10] That was free. But they don't they just
[1:13:12] they push play and they don't obey. But
[1:13:14] I'm here to tell you, God wants you to
[1:13:16] push play and obey. Read your every day.
[1:13:19] Get get before God and know him in an
[1:13:22] intimate way. Yeah,
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; he restored what happened in the garden.
[1:13:27] He wants you to walk with him alone.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Our God is a jealous God and he wants
[1:13:33] everything you've got. He wants you to
[1:13:35] give. He gave his whole entire life for
[1:13:38] me and you tonight.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; So why can't we give our life back to
[1:13:43] him and say, "Lord, what I got, I bring
[1:13:45] to you." It's kind of like Cain and Abel
[1:13:48] in the Bible. He here and Abel is and
[1:13:50] I'm going to dramatize a little bit for
[1:13:52] you. But here Cain and Abel, he had Cain
[1:13:55] and Here's Abel. Abel had a better
[1:13:58] sacrifice.
[1:14:00] Abel brought, you know, sorry, Abel had
[1:14:02] a better sacrifice than Cain. He worked
[1:14:04] all brother says he worked all year
[1:14:07] tilling the land. And he said he brought
[1:14:09] his sacrifice. He he said, "God, here it
[1:14:12] is." But you know why? Abel brought the
[1:14:14] first the first of his of this. He was a
[1:14:16] sheep herder. He was here he is. He
[1:14:18] brings the first of it. He brings it to
[1:14:20] God. And here brings this little lamb.
[1:14:22] And he says, "God, this is all I got."
[1:14:25] You know, God, don't you don't need to
[1:14:26] get c you don't need to clean up. You
[1:14:29] just need to bring everything to God
[1:14:30] before God and say, "God, here I am.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Here I am. Here's my first offerings.
[1:14:37] Here's everything of me. I made up. I I
[1:14:40] I need God. I come in this world
[1:14:42] speaking lies." And you can just say,
[1:14:43] "God, here I am tonight.
[1:14:46] Here I am tonight." He even said in one
[1:14:48] place he said he said I like what he
[1:14:50] said. He said he brought the first
[1:14:52] offerings of this little lamb and he
[1:14:54] goes to brother talks about it and I'm
[1:14:56] paraphrasing for time but he says he
[1:14:58] brings them and he said I could see him
[1:15:00] take this this vine and uh he takes this
[1:15:03] vine and he's dragging this little lamb
[1:15:04] and he said it's fallen and here it is
[1:15:07] trying to make the sacrifice and he says
[1:15:08] he gets it up to a rock and he said he
[1:15:11] gets it up to the rock and he says he
[1:15:13] finds a sharp rock and he starts to beat
[1:15:16] his neck and he said it started to beat
[1:15:18] his neck and blood started coming out
[1:15:20] and he said that that white that that
[1:15:22] wool started filling with blood and he
[1:15:25] said that's the same thing with Jesus
[1:15:27] Christ done for us. He he he took an
[1:15:30] innocent lamb that was not guilty a
[1:15:32] perfect lamb went in our place for me
[1:15:35] and you. He gave every one of us
[1:15:37] inheritance.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; We didn't deserve it. We didn't we were
[1:15:41] just born into it. Aren't you thankful
[1:15:43] today that when God called you, you
[1:15:46] recognize who you were? Yeah,
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; there's still people in the message that
[1:15:50] does it. They walk around and they're
[1:15:52] all down and out and they don't
[1:15:53] recognize who they are because they
[1:15:54] don't realize what God has done for
[1:15:56] them.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; What God has really done for you. He's
[1:16:01] gave you a wonderful vineyard to live
[1:16:03] in. He didn't give you a life that you
[1:16:05] could be miserable, down and out,
[1:16:07] anxiety. I'm here that ain't nothing but
[1:16:09] the devil.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; That's the devil trying to get you in
[1:16:13] his vineyard. But I'm here to tell you,
[1:16:15] God's vineyard is nothing but pure joy.
[1:16:17] Oh, oh, it gives you it gives you all
[1:16:20] the fruits of the spirit.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful of that today?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; So, I'm here to tell you today, protect
[1:16:26] your vineyard. If we leave here today
[1:16:28] and I'll ever see you again, I'm here to
[1:16:30] tell you to protect it with all you got.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Believe this message with all you got.
[1:16:35] Protect your homeront.
[1:16:38] Yeah,
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; as I like what this said. Verse uh verse
[1:16:42] two. I thought it was interesting. If
[1:16:44] you pull that up, it says, "And Ahab
[1:16:46] spoke unto Nahab. Naab saying, give me
[1:16:49] thy vineyard." I thought this was really
[1:16:51] interesting, brother Ber. He said, "That
[1:16:53] I may have it for a garden of herbs
[1:16:55] because it is near unto my house." I
[1:16:58] thought, "Wow, it's convenient.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Give me your vineyard. It's right next
[1:17:03] door. We need to stop settling for
[1:17:05] conveniency.
[1:17:06] We live in a convenient society where,
[1:17:09] hey, we got to have it right now. It's
[1:17:11] my way or the highway. Amazon, please
[1:17:14] order it now, boys. I mean, they'll be
[1:17:16] like, "Order like, I needed I needed it
[1:17:18] last night."
[1:17:20] I'm telling you, I work in the
[1:17:21] construction industry and you'll you'll
[1:17:23] you they'll buy something from you and
[1:17:25] they'll say, "Well, Chris, are you going
[1:17:26] to do it tomorrow?" "No, we just ordered
[1:17:28] your job. We just paid the deposit." But
[1:17:31] everybody wants it right now, right
[1:17:33] then. And that's how they want it.
[1:17:35] That's how it's become. Our our
[1:17:37] societyy's become that way. But I like
[1:17:39] how he said, "Give me thy vineyard
[1:17:41] because it's close to my house." And you
[1:17:44] know what's so funny how the devil will
[1:17:45] work? Young kids, he'll work. He'll even
[1:17:47] say this. He say, "Well, you know what?"
[1:17:49] He said, "I'll give you something
[1:17:51] better. I'll give you a better
[1:17:52] vineyard." It says in verse two, then
[1:17:54] that if he had a better vineyard to give
[1:17:57] you, I want you to understand this
[1:17:58] tonight. If he had a better message of
[1:18:00] the hour, if he had a better vineyard to
[1:18:02] give you, he would give it to you. Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't it like the devil to work up at
[1:18:08] somebody and go, "Hey, by the way, if
[1:18:11] you'll give me your vineyard, I'll give
[1:18:12] you a better vineyard." He didn't have a
[1:18:14] better vineyard to give them.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; There's not a better vineyard. There's
[1:18:18] not a better message of the hour.
[1:18:20] There's one message that Jesus Christ
[1:18:22] took a picture with and is hanging up
[1:18:25] there. I went and saw it. I'm telling
[1:18:27] you, he took a picture with Jesus
[1:18:29] Christ. There's not a better vineyard.
[1:18:31] You're living in the best vineyard you
[1:18:33] can live in.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Don't go looking for other vineyards to
[1:18:36] live in.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because it's near to my house,
[1:18:39] I'll give you a better vineyard." And it
[1:18:41] seemed good to thee, I will give thee,
[1:18:42] and it's so funny. Isn't it funny that
[1:18:44] he'll want you to sell out to the world?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, I'll give you the worth
[1:18:49] of it in money, kids. The devil will
[1:18:51] come to you in so many forms and say,
[1:18:54] "Sell out to this. Sell out to this
[1:18:56] music. Sell out to this nonsense." But
[1:18:59] I'm here to tell you, sell out to Jesus
[1:19:02] Christ.
[1:19:04] Sell out with all you got to Jesus
[1:19:06] Christ.
[1:19:10] Verse uh ch uh verse two, I thought it
[1:19:12] was good. He says that we're at the same
[1:19:14] thing as I'll give that better vineyard
[1:19:16] and the worth of money. So he wanted to
[1:19:18] give them a reimbursement. He wanted to
[1:19:20] give him something better. He said,
[1:19:21] "Hey, I got something better, but
[1:19:22] there's nothing better outside the
[1:19:24] message of the hour.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; I'm just that way. You can call me
[1:19:28] crazy. This message of the hour is my
[1:19:30] life. This message in the Bible is my
[1:19:34] life. I have found nothing better. I
[1:19:36] found the best vineyard and then God
[1:19:38] blessed me with a wonderful family, a
[1:19:40] wife that loves the Lord. And the boys,
[1:19:42] I tell you, I'm living in my best
[1:19:44] vineyard.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; And I want to protect it with all I got.
[1:19:48] And I'm here to encourage you. Fathers,
[1:19:50] dads, grandfathers, grandmothers, if you
[1:19:52] have to raise your children, your
[1:19:53] grandchildren, protect them with all you
[1:19:56] got. Yeah.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; The devil's coming after every home in
[1:19:59] this hour.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; I like Mark Mark 8:6. It says, "For what
[1:20:05] shall it profit a man if he should gain
[1:20:07] this whole world and lose his own soul?"
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Man, that's so true that you know what
[1:20:13] you could you could do this. I was
[1:20:14] telling you you can go to this church
[1:20:16] and go to that. Why why move away if you
[1:20:18] don't have a church? I don't care how
[1:20:19] much money it is.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; You find a good home church like brother
[1:20:23] Bam says and you stay in it. find a home
[1:20:26] church and he says even support it.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; I'm paraphrasing tonight. That was free.
[1:20:31] But I'm just here to tell you, brother
[1:20:33] Ber didn't tell me to tell you that. I'm
[1:20:35] just here to tell you that's where we
[1:20:36] should be. We should be a lot further
[1:20:38] along than we are.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; We should be a lot further along in this
[1:20:42] message in the Bible than we are. But I
[1:20:45] tell you what, we live prophet God talks
[1:20:47] about how we live below our privileges.
[1:20:49] He's called you sons and daughters of
[1:20:51] the king. And I like what he said. Daddy
[1:20:53] said when Rebecca would ask him to sit
[1:20:54] up in his lap, he would go, "Daddy, show
[1:20:57] me your muscles
[1:21:00] and he said, I felt like the smallest,
[1:21:02] oldest man, whatever he said, however he
[1:21:04] said it." He said, "But I sure loved it
[1:21:06] when he asked you asked me that." And
[1:21:08] that's Imagine what our father does. I
[1:21:11] was thinking about this tonight. Imagine
[1:21:13] what we get in God's lap and say, "Lord,
[1:21:16] I want you to hear me." And he goes,
[1:21:18] "I'm here. I've been waiting for you to
[1:21:19] talk to me all day. I've been waiting on
[1:21:22] you.
[1:21:24] That's our God today. He cares. He's
[1:21:26] your daddy today. We got the best daddy.
[1:21:29] We got the King of Kings, the Lord of
[1:21:30] Lords. That's your daddy today.
[1:21:35] You just got to knock on the door.
[1:21:39] You just got to knock on the door and
[1:21:40] say, "Lord, I haven't talked to you in a
[1:21:43] while. I just want to go in the cool of
[1:21:46] my home, walk around the the backyard or
[1:21:48] wherever it is, get in a secret place
[1:21:49] and just say, "Lord, I just want to talk
[1:21:51] to you."
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants. He wants your
[1:21:56] fellowship.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; But I like his response. His response
[1:22:01] Ahab said in verse three, it said, "Ahab
[1:22:03] said to Ahab, I hope this is okay." He
[1:22:05] said, "The Lord forbid it to me I should
[1:22:07] give thy inheritance to fathers unto
[1:22:09] thee." And that's how we should be in
[1:22:11] this hour that you're not I don't care
[1:22:13] if my dad comes against me. I don't care
[1:22:15] who comes against me. We are going to
[1:22:17] press on with the message of the hour.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; I got the best vineyard I can ever look
[1:22:21] for. I'm done looking. I don't need to
[1:22:24] look anymore, brother Ber.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; This is the best. I'm living in heavenly
[1:22:28] places. You You should be living in
[1:22:30] heavenly places. But I tell you, it's
[1:22:32] time to put a smile on your face and
[1:22:34] realize what God has handed you in this
[1:22:36] day.
[1:22:38] He's gave you the best vineyard you
[1:22:40] could live in.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it. Not Not only the
[1:22:45] bride will just be on the outside of the
[1:22:47] city. We will be on the inside of the
[1:22:49] city.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's what I'm That's where I
[1:22:52] want to be. I want to be on the inside
[1:22:54] of the city and I could just one day get
[1:22:57] down and kneel at my father and say,
[1:22:58] "Lord, you know, when he when we're at
[1:23:00] the marriage supper, think about it."
[1:23:02] And he comes by. The he'll come by and
[1:23:05] wipe our eyes. And he says he'll he'll
[1:23:07] just he'll wipe your tears and he'll
[1:23:09] say, "Hey, it's over. It's finished. I
[1:23:12] believe that's where we're at, young
[1:23:14] people. I believe we're here. I'm not
[1:23:15] here to scare you, but I'm here to tell
[1:23:17] you we are here. We have arrived.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; If you haven't got in the vineyard, I
[1:23:23] encourage you tonight. I provoke you
[1:23:25] tonight to get in the vineyard."
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; To let God be, let the Holy Ghost be the
[1:23:31] controller of your life. Let him to be
[1:23:33] your control tower.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:36] That's like you're getting in the plane
[1:23:37] and you you you think about you walk in
[1:23:39] a plane sometime we fly we've flown so
[1:23:41] much in the last 12 15 years preaching.
[1:23:45] I always thought it's so funny. I'll get
[1:23:46] in the plane and I'll get in the back
[1:23:48] and we'll sit down and Rachel's like
[1:23:50] what are you looking at? I'm like I'm
[1:23:51] looking through the door and I hate when
[1:23:52] the stewardist you're going to laugh but
[1:23:54] I hate when the stewardist is just like
[1:23:56] hey how you doing? I'm like can you
[1:23:57] move? I want to see who's driving this
[1:23:59] plane.
[1:24:02] I want to see who it is. is I want to
[1:24:04] see if they got I want to see if they
[1:24:05] got experience. I want to see if it's a
[1:24:07] 2-year-old about to fly somewhere. I
[1:24:09] want to know. But aren't you glad your
[1:24:11] father is controlling? He's the control
[1:24:13] tower tonight and he has all your
[1:24:15] solutions. He has your healing. He has
[1:24:18] everything you need tonight. Just get to
[1:24:21] the father.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; But you get in this plane and we look up
[1:24:25] there and she go, "What are you looking
[1:24:26] at?" I just want to see who's flying the
[1:24:28] plane. Is it a robot? Who is it? Is it
[1:24:30] Is it AI? whatever we got today.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, you got more
[1:24:35] than AI today. You got a discerner of
[1:24:38] the heart of the spirit. You got a I
[1:24:40] tell you, you got a father that's worth
[1:24:42] uh worth a million million trillion
[1:24:44] worlds.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Like he says, one world one one soul is
[1:24:48] worth a million worlds. I'm thankful for
[1:24:51] that. And he said, Nab, I like what his
[1:24:55] response was. He protected his vineyard.
[1:24:57] He said that I should give thy
[1:24:58] inheritance of thy fathers to thee. So
[1:25:00] he said, "Hey, I'm not giving you my
[1:25:02] vineyard. I know what I got. You need to
[1:25:04] realize what you got, young people, and
[1:25:07] protect it with all you got. Not for
[1:25:09] some boy, not for some alcoholic, not
[1:25:12] for somebody social media friend."
[1:25:14] Because we get on social media and they
[1:25:16] become your best friend.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; They become your virtual friend because
[1:25:21] they can't have the nerve to talk to you
[1:25:23] in public. They'll just be like, "Hey,
[1:25:25] how you doing? I saw you at the meeting.
[1:25:27] Why didn't you talk to me at the
[1:25:28] meeting?"
[1:25:29] because it becomes a virtue. It's easier
[1:25:31] to do. That's how the devil does. He's
[1:25:34] very sly. He wants to take everything
[1:25:36] you got.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying it, but
[1:25:39] that's just that's just just there.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, he said, he
[1:25:44] said, "What are you scared about?" He
[1:25:47] said, "No wonder." He said, "Fear not. I
[1:25:49] am he that was dead and alive and again,
[1:25:51] and I'm alive forever more, and I have
[1:25:54] the keys of death, hell. Don't worry
[1:25:56] about
[1:25:58] nothing. That's what the prophet of God
[1:26:00] says. He said, "Don't worry about
[1:26:02] nothing." I think it would be doing some
[1:26:04] good to just write that down. Don't
[1:26:05] worry about nothing. That's hard to do.
[1:26:08] I promise I do it. I'm like, "Wow, don't
[1:26:11] worry about nothing. Even death can't
[1:26:13] even hurt you." Notice it's beautiful.
[1:26:17] Probably God says, he goes on to say, he
[1:26:19] said, "Let's go." Right. Right. But
[1:26:21] right quick now the abstract title
[1:26:23] abstract title the debt is settled.
[1:26:26] Everything against you against it has
[1:26:28] been struck off. Glory. He said I may
[1:26:31] act silly but I feel good. I say amen to
[1:26:35] that. He said no. See oh an abstract
[1:26:38] deed. Did you realize what that means?
[1:26:40] Did you realize what that means,
[1:26:42] brother? He said there's nothing that
[1:26:45] can take it away from you. Amen. I'm the
[1:26:47] holder. Amen. You're the holder. Aren't
[1:26:50] you glad that that by his grace that
[1:26:52] you're the holder of the abstract title
[1:26:54] deed?
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "What deed?" He said, "I have
[1:26:58] now uh cast it on on my beneficiary of
[1:27:01] his death, burial, and resurrection."
[1:27:04] He said, "He became me that I might
[1:27:06] become him."
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "He became a sinner that I
[1:27:10] might become a son." Amen. I hold the
[1:27:13] abstract title deed. He said, "For these
[1:27:15] signs shall follow them that believe.
[1:27:18] Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, that's the the abstract
[1:27:21] deed." The prophet of God goes on to
[1:27:23] say, he said, "One day this buyer,"
[1:27:27] he said he noticed a fine young man with
[1:27:29] his chest down, his head up. You didn't
[1:27:32] have to whip him. He he was on alert. He
[1:27:35] said every time he he was he was done,
[1:27:38] he he said, "You don't have to hit him."
[1:27:39] He said, "And that save buyer said, I
[1:27:42] want to buy him." And the owner said,
[1:27:43] "He's not for sale."
[1:27:46] He said, "What makes him so up uh up and
[1:27:49] add it?" He said, "Is he a boss over the
[1:27:51] rest of them?" He said, "No, sir." He
[1:27:53] said, "No, he's just a slave."
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you feed them better than
[1:27:58] you do the rest of them?" "No." He said,
[1:28:00] "He eats out of the gallery." He eats
[1:28:03] out of the galley with the rest of them.
[1:28:06] He said, "Then what makes him so much
[1:28:08] different?" So up his moral seems to be
[1:28:11] high. his moral. Well, he see she, the
[1:28:14] prophet of God says, "What makes him so
[1:28:16] different from others?" They're asking
[1:28:18] the question. He said, "I don't know
[1:28:20] myself." He said, "Till I find out
[1:28:22] recently that his father is a king of
[1:28:25] the tribe."
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "And though he's an alien in
[1:28:29] another land, he knows his daddy's a
[1:28:32] king."
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; He said he acts like it. He conducts
[1:28:40] himself like a king's son. He said,
[1:28:42] "What ought a Christian to do then?
[1:28:45] We're pilgrims and strangers, but our
[1:28:47] father is the king."
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Not a king, but the king.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, what we ought we act like
[1:28:56] when we live in this present world, not
[1:28:58] like this world, not not to be drove
[1:29:00] around and sign a ticket. Well, come to
[1:29:02] church and we'll try our best to do this
[1:29:05] and we'll go to the next prayer meeting.
[1:29:09] Brother, sister, we should conduct
[1:29:10] ourselves like sons and daughters of
[1:29:12] God.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh," he said, "you're a
[1:29:17] family. What are you? You raise your
[1:29:19] child in a certain environment." Listen
[1:29:21] to this. It's got 98% better chance to
[1:29:24] go the right way than it has to bring
[1:29:26] them up in the wrong way.
[1:29:30] I tell you, I love that quote. I've
[1:29:31] always loved that quote. It says, "If
[1:29:33] you bring them up in the right way, you
[1:29:34] have 98% better chance." I'll take my
[1:29:38] chances tonight.
[1:29:40] I'll take my chances tonight. I'm
[1:29:42] thankful for that. He said, "Bring up a
[1:29:43] child as the scripture says, and the way
[1:29:45] it should go and they when they get old,
[1:29:47] don't depart." And I'm here to tell you,
[1:29:48] you might have a weward son. You might
[1:29:50] have a weward daughter. Great. I'm here
[1:29:52] to tell you, claim your house.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance tonight. The
[1:29:57] Bible, God says, "Hey, Rahab hung, look,
[1:30:00] she had the scarlet cord out and she
[1:30:02] claimed her whole entire house."
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's time to hang the
[1:30:06] scarlet cord out of there and start
[1:30:07] telling the devil who you are, who your
[1:30:09] father is. I don't care how far your
[1:30:11] son's got, how far your grandchildren's
[1:30:14] got. You claim them tonight.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; They're your inheritance. I'll tell you
[1:30:18] another place that that you might be the
[1:30:20] only reason they get in tonight.
[1:30:23] So, I'm here to tell you to claim your
[1:30:25] vineyard to protect it with all you got
[1:30:28] because you might be the only mother,
[1:30:30] the only father that a son gets in
[1:30:32] tonight because you've claimed your
[1:30:34] vineyard. You stayed the you you fought
[1:30:37] a good fight. We got to keep fighting
[1:30:40] this fight of faith. It's not an easy
[1:30:42] walk. I'm here to tell you when you put
[1:30:44] the brother pastor, when you put the
[1:30:46] uniform on, it's just like the military.
[1:30:47] I was telling you the GI bill. I didn't
[1:30:49] sign it. I tell my brother right here
[1:30:51] that served in the military, I I'll be
[1:30:53] honest. I'm just being very vulnerable.
[1:30:55] I didn't sign up for a war. I signed up
[1:30:58] for education because I needed to pay
[1:31:00] for it. But when I when the time came, I
[1:31:03] said, "Well, here we go. We got to go
[1:31:05] train for it. We got to get ready." And
[1:31:07] there was some preparation that we had
[1:31:09] to go do. We had to go somewhere. We
[1:31:11] were watching. We had to go here, go to
[1:31:13] Fort Bliss, Texas. And they had the
[1:31:15] preparation to get us ready. You know,
[1:31:17] we're making oursel ready right now. You
[1:31:20] come in this house of God. You're making
[1:31:22] you're clothing yourself every single
[1:31:25] day. Every time you read the word, every
[1:31:27] time you pray, you are clothing
[1:31:30] yourself.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; You're making yourself ready. The bride
[1:31:34] is making herself ready for this coming.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; You're not just sitting here wasting up
[1:31:40] air. It's a time to get off your seat
[1:31:41] and say, you know what? I'm going to do
[1:31:43] something for God.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do something. And I'm not
[1:31:47] just going to sit here and say, "Well,
[1:31:48] I'll ask people all the time, how long
[1:31:50] you been in the message?" Well, I've
[1:31:51] been in brother Chris, I've been in the
[1:31:52] message 50 years.
[1:31:54] And they ain't happy at all. I'm like,
[1:31:57] brother, you I'm tell you what, you
[1:31:58] hadn't found Jesus.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; You haven't seen the revelation and what
[1:32:03] God's done for me. And they'll say,
[1:32:05] "Well, I just grown up in the message
[1:32:06] and I've been around." The problem is
[1:32:08] you don't need to grow up in the
[1:32:09] message. You don't need to be around the
[1:32:11] message. Brother said, "The message
[1:32:13] needs to be inside of you.
[1:32:16] The message has to be you and you and
[1:32:18] the God alone where you walk in the
[1:32:21] truth and say, "God, this is my
[1:32:23] vineyard. I don't I won't sell it. I
[1:32:25] don't care if he says there's more
[1:32:27] money." I had my parents come at a young
[1:32:29] age and say, "Hey, if you'll leave that
[1:32:31] message, I'll give you everything I
[1:32:32] got." She'll tell you
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; if you leave what not the craziness you
[1:32:37] believe. I said, "Dad, you can leave me
[1:32:39] alone." I said, "I don't want your
[1:32:41] money. I don't want anything you got." I
[1:32:43] said, "Because I found the best thing
[1:32:45] that's ever changed my life." There
[1:32:47] ain't no other message in the world. And
[1:32:49] I'm here to tell you young kids, you
[1:32:50] protect your vineyard tonight.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; You protect it like Nabal.
[1:32:59] That's Romans 12. They turn if they'll
[1:33:01] turn to Romans 12 1-2.
[1:33:04] Romans 12 1-2. It says, "I beseech you
[1:33:07] be therefore, brethren, by the mercies
[1:33:09] of God that you present your bodies a
[1:33:11] living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
[1:33:13] God,
[1:33:15] which is your which is your reasonable
[1:33:17] service. And be not conformed, listen
[1:33:20] young people, be not conformed to this
[1:33:21] world, but ye transformed by the
[1:33:24] renewing of your mind, that ye may
[1:33:26] reprove what is good and acceptable and
[1:33:29] perfect will of God."
[1:33:31] The prophet of God says and he goes on
[1:33:34] to say he says a true predestinated
[1:33:36] believers will stay with the word
[1:33:38] because they are part of the word.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Let me read it one more time. He said a
[1:33:44] true predestinated believers will stay
[1:33:46] with the word because they're part of
[1:33:49] the word.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; I tell you if you're still here today
[1:33:52] and you're still standing is because
[1:33:54] you're part of the word.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; The word people leave they leave left
[1:33:58] and right. They leave a vineyard. I
[1:34:00] can't believe it, brother Berler. People
[1:34:02] leave these vineyards and I'm like, how
[1:34:04] do you leave? Because they never was in
[1:34:06] the vineyard.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; They they never was in the word. The
[1:34:10] word never became flesh.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And revelation to them.
[1:34:15] As Martin Luther, he I was looking at
[1:34:17] what Martha Luton said. Martin Luther,
[1:34:19] he says that uh he says he taught
[1:34:21] Christians to have a responsibility to
[1:34:23] protect their homes and property. He
[1:34:25] said he's seeing it as part of their
[1:34:26] duty to God in society. This protection
[1:34:29] should be balanced. He said with a
[1:34:31] commitment to serve others and resist un
[1:34:34] unjust authority and necessary always
[1:34:36] striving to act in accordance with God's
[1:34:39] will.
[1:34:41] John Wesley, I like what he said. He
[1:34:43] said, "Do you believe?" He said, "Do you
[1:34:44] believe that God's commands you not to
[1:34:46] be conformed to the world? Do you
[1:34:48] believe it and dare you to obey it?" He
[1:34:50] said, "Dare you now separate yourselves
[1:34:52] from this world? Never again be
[1:34:54] controlled by it and never again be
[1:34:58] waffled by it here and there and by its
[1:35:00] fashions.
[1:35:02] I tell you I turn to John 15 tonight. I
[1:35:05] was thinking about John how we are the
[1:35:07] I'll turn it real quick. John 15 how we
[1:35:09] are the true vine. God has called you to
[1:35:11] be the true vine.
[1:35:14] Hey verse 15 verse one. John 15 verse1
[1:35:17] he says I am the true vine and my father
[1:35:19] is the husband. Every branch in me that
[1:35:22] beareth not the fruit, we're talking
[1:35:23] about a vineyard. He says, every every
[1:35:25] branch that not beareth beareth not
[1:35:28] fruit, he taketh it away, and every
[1:35:30] branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth
[1:35:32] beareth fruit, he purgeth purgth it, and
[1:35:35] that may bring forth more fruit. And now
[1:35:38] that the clean through the word which
[1:35:39] has spoken to you abide in me and in you
[1:35:42] and as a branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:35:44] itself except abide abide in the vine.
[1:35:48] No more ye except to be abiding abide in
[1:35:50] me. I am the vine you are what? The
[1:35:53] branches. He that abideth in me and I in
[1:35:57] him the same bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:36:01] For without me you can do nothing. So
[1:36:04] I'm here to tell you you are the
[1:36:05] branches. God needs somebody, a living,
[1:36:08] walking uh being tonight to be connected
[1:36:11] to the trunk.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; He needs me and he needs our hands. He
[1:36:14] needs your feet. He needs your mouth.
[1:36:16] And I'm here to tell you, he's called
[1:36:18] you out today for a reason.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say verse seven, it says
[1:36:25] that if you abide in me and my words
[1:36:27] abide in you, you shall ask what you
[1:36:29] will and it shall be done unto you. He
[1:36:32] said, 'Herein my father glorified that
[1:36:34] you bear much fruit shall be my
[1:36:37] disciples. As the father had loved me,
[1:36:39] so he I loved him continue in thy love.
[1:36:42] For if you keep me keep my commandments,
[1:36:44] you shall abide in love in my love. Even
[1:36:47] if I have accepted my father's
[1:36:49] commandments and abide in his love.
[1:36:52] Verse 11, it says, "These things that I
[1:36:54] have spoken to you that your joy might
[1:36:56] remain in you, that my joy might remain
[1:36:59] in you and that your joy might be full."
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; I tell you, be doing some good tonight
[1:37:04] and say, "Lord, fill me with some joy.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; I might my tank is low. I'm tired of
[1:37:09] just walking around, Brother Chris. I
[1:37:10] want what you I want the fire of God to
[1:37:13] fill my vessel tonight. I want him to
[1:37:15] fill everything that's within me. I want
[1:37:17] to Maybe it's a mother that's wore out
[1:37:19] tonight that says, "Hey, I'm just tired.
[1:37:21] I'm just barely getting through. I'm
[1:37:22] tired of doing this. I'm tired of
[1:37:24] washing dishes. I'm tired of do cleaning
[1:37:26] the clothes. But I'm here to God is
[1:37:28] telling you tonight, hey, keep pressing
[1:37:30] forward. Keep striving with all you got.
[1:37:33] God is here to refill you tonight,
[1:37:36] Lord.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, we're doing some good. I
[1:37:39] want another refilling.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; We can't exhaust God's refillings.
[1:37:44] Aren't you thankful tonight?
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; It's like going to I got tell you going
[1:37:48] to the gas station. You got to keep
[1:37:49] filling up. Rachel get on to me all the
[1:37:51] time. Honey, it says two miles to empty.
[1:37:54] Baby, I wouldn't wait. I wouldn't wait.
[1:37:57] I'm just being honest. She'll shake her
[1:37:59] head. I'm just being truthful. She'll
[1:38:01] say, "Brother Ber, I there's a gas
[1:38:03] station up the road." And finally, I
[1:38:04] pass it. I'm like, "I thought there
[1:38:06] was." And then you get to praying. You
[1:38:08] know, we can't live like that with God's
[1:38:10] grace.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; We got to be filled up and say, "God,
[1:38:14] refill me every time I come in these
[1:38:16] doors. Every time I come on a Wednesday
[1:38:18] night, it might feel like it might be
[1:38:20] the only might be five people in here,
[1:38:22] but God, I come to get refilled.
[1:38:26] I come to get a touch from God.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Stop worrying about the people to your
[1:38:31] left and the people to your right or oh,
[1:38:34] is Susan going to show up? Don't worry
[1:38:36] about Susan. Just worry about you and
[1:38:37] your house. Worry about your vineyard.
[1:38:40] Make sure they get in the car, boys. We
[1:38:42] going to church.
[1:38:45] As long as you live in this house, we
[1:38:47] going to church.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; As my brother said earlier, they said, I
[1:38:51] always said that saying, my brother Wade
[1:38:53] said it. He said, they said, I told one
[1:38:55] someone one time, one pastor, I said,
[1:38:57] man, my kids got a drug problem. They
[1:38:58] said, what? I said, yeah, they've been
[1:39:01] drugged church to church to church.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Their whole life. They've been drugged
[1:39:06] to church.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; That's all they know is church. But I'm
[1:39:09] here to tell you you, it's more than
[1:39:10] just knowing church. It's knowing the
[1:39:12] maker. It's knowing the author tonight.
[1:39:15] It's knowing who you where you stand
[1:39:17] tonight.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I'm thankful tonight. I'm so
[1:39:24] thankful.
[1:39:26] But verse uh 13, it said, "Greater love,
[1:39:29] no greater love than no man than this,
[1:39:31] that he'd lay down his life for his
[1:39:33] friends. Ye are my friends if you do
[1:39:35] whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I
[1:39:38] call you not servants. For the servantth
[1:39:41] knoweth not what the what his lord
[1:39:43] doeth, but I called you friends. For all
[1:39:46] things that I have heard of my father, I
[1:39:48] have made known unto you.
[1:39:51] Verse 16, it says, "You have not chosen
[1:39:54] me." Aren't you thankful?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; But I have chosen you. I have ordained
[1:39:58] you that you should go and bring for uh
[1:40:01] forth fruit that your fruit should be
[1:40:04] remained. What whatsoever you shall ask
[1:40:05] in your father's name, he may give it to
[1:40:08] you. Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; These things I commanded to you that you
[1:40:12] love one another
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; not hate one another.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Love one another. You know, another
[1:40:17] thing I see in a lot of churches, oh
[1:40:19] well, they're they need prayer. Pray for
[1:40:21] them. They did this. They did that. You
[1:40:23] know what? I quit worrying about the
[1:40:25] person to your right, to your left.
[1:40:28] You know what? Quit worrying about where
[1:40:30] they're living. Just, hey, if they're in
[1:40:31] the pew, let God do the let let God give
[1:40:34] the increase.
[1:40:37] Don't matter how they look, whatever
[1:40:38] they if they come in the house of God,
[1:40:40] let them come in. But you know what? We
[1:40:41] going God's going to come down and let
[1:40:43] the God do the changing.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; The word goes forth. It'll do the
[1:40:47] changing.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; And you know what? That's what hold
[1:40:50] them.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; That's what'll change a life.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; That's what holds my marriage together.
[1:40:55] That's what holds my kids together is
[1:40:57] this word of God. The word of the the
[1:40:59] the God that's held me 21 years in this
[1:41:03] message is all Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "These things I command you
[1:41:09] that you love one for another. If you
[1:41:12] hate, if the world hate you, listen to
[1:41:15] this. The world world have hate you, ye
[1:41:17] that hated me before it hated you."
[1:41:20] Young people, the world will come
[1:41:21] against you, the world will say you
[1:41:23] this. They'll tell you that. They'll
[1:41:24] like Nahhab's land. They'll tell you
[1:41:26] this is better. This is better over
[1:41:28] here. But I'm here to tell you, get
[1:41:30] anchored in Jesus Christ.
[1:41:33] And I tell you what, if I could go back,
[1:41:35] like brother Brandham says, if I could
[1:41:37] go back and give my life 20 years before
[1:41:40] or 20 years old, I would have gave it to
[1:41:42] him.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; You're at a great age, say, Lord, I
[1:41:45] surrender everything to him.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Verse 19, he says, "If you were of the
[1:41:50] world, the world would love his own. But
[1:41:53] because you are not of the world, this
[1:41:55] is you. But I have chosen you out of the
[1:41:58] world, therefore the world hateth you."
[1:42:01] Young people, the world hates you.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; The devil hates you. He wants to come
[1:42:05] after you. But I'm here to tell you to
[1:42:06] protect your vineyard tonight. I thought
[1:42:09] about the three Hebrew children. I
[1:42:12] thought about how they wanted to uh
[1:42:14] kneel down at this golden image and and
[1:42:16] and worship Baal. And here's the three
[1:42:18] ch the three Hebrew children. And I like
[1:42:21] how brother Brandon paraphrases. He gets
[1:42:22] up to the fiery furnace. They had it
[1:42:24] seven times harder. And he says, it says
[1:42:26] in the Bible that the guards were p
[1:42:28] dying as they were throwing them in.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; It was so hot that when he got him to
[1:42:33] the furnace, this is another one that
[1:42:35] that didn't matter. He wasn't going to
[1:42:36] give up. He matter if he stoned him like
[1:42:38] like uh like Jezebel. Jezebel took his
[1:42:41] Nab's life to get his vineyard. He will
[1:42:44] take everything you got. He will come
[1:42:46] after your home. He will come after
[1:42:48] everything. So, I'm here to tell you to
[1:42:50] get in the word of God. Let it cover
[1:42:52] your home. Let it cover your life.
[1:42:55] But them three Hebrew children, they
[1:42:56] wouldn't bow down. You know the story.
[1:42:58] And they would wouldn't bow down and
[1:43:00] they get in the fiery furnace and there
[1:43:01] was a fourth man in the furnace.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; And I like what brother Ram says. He
[1:43:06] said the angels would come up to God and
[1:43:08] say, "You know what?" He would say,
[1:43:10] "Woodworm." And and he said they would
[1:43:11] come up. He said, "Hey, I could I can I
[1:43:13] can blow it out with water. I can blow
[1:43:15] that out with water." He said, "You know
[1:43:17] what? This job's for me."
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "He came down. and he said he
[1:43:22] grabbed that thunderbolt of lightning
[1:43:24] and come through and here he comes and
[1:43:26] he he's always on time.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; We serve a God that's always on time,
[1:43:31] young people that you might go through
[1:43:32] the darkest time in your life. You might
[1:43:35] go through the hardest trial in your
[1:43:36] life. You might come from a split up
[1:43:38] home like I did. But I'm here to tell
[1:43:40] you, don't let the devil tell you you
[1:43:41] can't have a home that's not put
[1:43:43] together.
[1:43:45] Right.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; 19 years later, we're married and I'm
[1:43:49] here to tell you almost 19 years and we
[1:43:51] still have a home that loves God, that
[1:43:53] praises God, that come from a broke up
[1:43:55] home. And I made a commitment to God. I
[1:43:57] said, "If you give me a one woman filled
[1:43:59] with the Holy Ghost, Lord, I will serve
[1:44:02] you the rest of my life."
[1:44:05] And he did. He gave me a wonderful home
[1:44:08] that loves the Lord. But I'm here to
[1:44:10] tell you, protect your homeront. Protect
[1:44:13] your church. protect what God has given
[1:44:15] you in this house.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, he said, "What
[1:44:20] did Christ redeem us for?" He said,
[1:44:23] "What he did redeem us for?" He said,
[1:44:25] "Did you ever think what he redeemed us
[1:44:27] for?" He said, "Why didn't he just make
[1:44:29] the atonement and say now here there's
[1:44:32] here?" He said, "There's no need to
[1:44:33] giving them these powers." He said,
[1:44:35] "There's no need to making them sons
[1:44:38] this man a son of God. There's no need
[1:44:40] in doing that." The prophet of God says,
[1:44:42] "I'll just ask him to believe this and
[1:44:44] write in his name in the book of heaven
[1:44:47] and that will settle it." But he gave us
[1:44:50] this redeemed blessings that we might
[1:44:52] operate the work of God by the energy of
[1:44:55] the Holy Spirit.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; I never forget we were in Israel a
[1:45:00] couple years with the boys. I think it
[1:45:01] was a couple years ago and we were
[1:45:02] walking around Israel and and we went to
[1:45:05] uh we went there and we saw the uh what
[1:45:08] all the books and where they got killed
[1:45:10] and what was that called? I forgot the
[1:45:12] name of it but the Holocaust Museum.
[1:45:15] That's right. And we were there and I
[1:45:17] walked we were walking through there and
[1:45:19] I got to the last room and there was a
[1:45:21] books everywhere and and it was all the
[1:45:23] names that got killed in the Holocaust
[1:45:25] for and you see all these books and
[1:45:27] names and I started to weep and I
[1:45:29] started to think. I said, "You know
[1:45:30] what? But from the foundation of the
[1:45:32] world, my name was written in one of the
[1:45:34] books." I said, "From the foundation of
[1:45:37] the world, my name was written down. I
[1:45:39] just had to accept it." And I'm thankful
[1:45:42] tonight. We got to redeem. God has given
[1:45:44] you such great vineyard tonight. You
[1:45:47] might think, "Hey, I can have a better
[1:45:49] vineyard. I can have a better job." You
[1:45:51] know, the devil wants to say you can
[1:45:52] always have something better.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, there's
[1:45:56] nothing better than the message of the
[1:45:57] hour.
[1:45:59] There's nothing better than the book
[1:46:01] that's been revealed to us from Genesis
[1:46:03] to Revelation.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; I love it. I love it with all my heart.
[1:46:09] Another another place he says the
[1:46:10] prophet of God says he says he says
[1:46:13] someone will want want you to go here
[1:46:15] and and lead you at prayer meeting and
[1:46:17] then he's got a different idea from what
[1:46:19] really the Bible says, but he believes
[1:46:22] it this way anyhow. and he he'll start
[1:46:25] an influence and draw others away from
[1:46:27] it. He said the thing to do is is to
[1:46:30] protect this message. That's what the
[1:46:33] prophet of God said. He said the thing
[1:46:35] to do is to protect this message the way
[1:46:37] it's going straight right with it and
[1:46:40] knock everything away from it if we're
[1:46:42] ever going to cross the goal line.
[1:46:45] I love that. I underlined it. The thing
[1:46:48] to do is to protect this message. I'm
[1:46:50] here to tell you, I'm here to protect it
[1:46:52] with everything that's within me. Aren't
[1:46:54] you thankful tonight?
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; I thought about Joshua 24 verse 14
[1:47:01] through 15. It says, "Now therefore,
[1:47:05] fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity
[1:47:07] and truth. Put away the gods which your
[1:47:10] fathers have served on the other side of
[1:47:12] the flood in Egypt and serve ye the
[1:47:15] Lord." Verse 15, this is it should be
[1:47:18] you. It says, "If it seem evil unto the
[1:47:21] unto you to serve the Lord, choose you
[1:47:23] this day whom you will serve, whether
[1:47:27] the gods which your fathers serve that
[1:47:29] were on the other side of the flood or
[1:47:31] the gods of the Amorites and those and
[1:47:34] whose land you dwell. But as for me in
[1:47:37] my house,
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; but for me in my house we will serve the
[1:47:42] Lord."
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Another place brother Ram goes on
[1:47:46] to say he said we may go through a lot
[1:47:48] of troubles and trials. I say amen. He
[1:47:51] said just remember there's someone who
[1:47:53] knows the lights the way and makes it
[1:47:55] real.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; He said I don't know what bring what
[1:48:00] what's behind the curtain but I know one
[1:48:03] thing. I'm pressing towards the mark of
[1:48:05] the high calling every day trying to
[1:48:08] live for the great event.
[1:48:12] every day trying to live for the great
[1:48:14] event that will take place, young
[1:48:16] people, that'll take place someday when
[1:48:19] I shall see him face to face and tell
[1:48:22] the story saved by his grace. That's the
[1:48:25] day I live for. That's the day you want
[1:48:27] to live for.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; It says leaving those things behind
[1:48:32] which are I want to press on, keep going
[1:48:35] on. That's like brother Bram talks about
[1:48:36] when he gets behind the curtain of time.
[1:48:38] He gets back and has to go back in that
[1:48:40] his body and he didn't want to and he
[1:48:42] didn't want to go back in that past
[1:48:44] house and they said keep pressing.
[1:48:45] Millions said keep pressing on.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on. I preached the same
[1:48:51] thing Paul preached. We're preaching the
[1:48:53] same thing the the Paul preached
[1:48:55] tonight. We are we are believing when
[1:48:57] we're all resting on that tonight.
[1:49:01] I would rather rest on that tonight,
[1:49:03] young people, than anything any
[1:49:04] denomination brings, any man-made ideas.
[1:49:08] I would rather rest on the word of God.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; If it says you can have the Holy Ghost,
[1:49:13] you can have the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Too many kids in this day are well, I
[1:49:18] will go through prayer lines and and BYC
[1:49:20] and they'll come up and say, "Brother, I
[1:49:21] want the Holy Ghost." I said, "Well, God
[1:49:23] wants to give it to you more than the
[1:49:24] oceans through a pipe." The prophet of
[1:49:26] God talks about how how you how a fish
[1:49:29] does a fish have to ask sparingly for
[1:49:31] water. Just keep drinking. I'm here to
[1:49:35] tell you tonight, just keep drinking
[1:49:36] God's blessings and say, God, don't let
[1:49:38] the devil tell you you got the Holy
[1:49:40] Ghost one time and then you don't have
[1:49:41] it.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; You get the Holy Ghost and it you're se
[1:49:46] it says you're sealed until the day of
[1:49:48] redemption.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say he's an Indian giver. Our
[1:49:51] God, when he gives you the Holy Ghost,
[1:49:53] you are sealed. That doesn't mean you're
[1:49:55] going to fall. It doesn't mean you're
[1:49:57] going to fall and slip up. But I'm here
[1:49:58] to tell you, it'll make you get on your
[1:50:00] knees and say, "God, I'm forgive me." Or
[1:50:02] it'll make you go make it right to
[1:50:03] somebody.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; That's our holy that's the Holy Ghost
[1:50:07] that guides you in everything. He guides
[1:50:09] you. So young people, I'm here to tell
[1:50:11] you tonight to find get into Jesus
[1:50:14] Christ.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Find your vineyard.
[1:50:19] The influence of another. He said, "When
[1:50:21] you're playing a ball game,
[1:50:23] when you're playing a ball game, as the
[1:50:25] magicians come," he says, "And when
[1:50:27] you're playing a ball game, as it's
[1:50:29] football season," I thought, "Wow." He
[1:50:32] said, "The thing you want to do is not
[1:50:34] everybody trying to take the ball away
[1:50:36] from the man that's got it."
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Brother Ber," I thought,
[1:50:42] "Ain't that the truth? Isn't that the
[1:50:43] day we live in that we we got the ball
[1:50:46] or the pastor's got the ball and we're
[1:50:47] trying to rip it from his hands? We
[1:50:49] should be praying for him.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest. We should be
[1:50:53] praying for the man of God that's
[1:50:54] protected this house, that's trying to
[1:50:56] build something here,
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; not trying to rip the ball from each
[1:51:00] other. But I'm here to tell you, Prophet
[1:51:01] God said the thing we want to do is not
[1:51:04] everybody try to rip the ball away from
[1:51:05] the man that's got it. It It's trying to
[1:51:08] guard that man, protect him, let him get
[1:51:11] through. We're trying to make a goal.
[1:51:14] You see,
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; I thought that was pretty good. He said,
[1:51:18] Robert God says, "But could you imagine
[1:51:20] a team so untrained so to find one man,
[1:51:24] their own man with the ball running down
[1:51:26] to the goal field, the field goal, and
[1:51:28] instead of trying to knock the enemy
[1:51:31] away from him, the opposing team to let
[1:51:34] one with their own man that's got to
[1:51:36] take the ball off with that with it,
[1:51:39] every man trying to take the ball out of
[1:51:41] his hand, why? You're bound to lose."
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; I love it. Because that's how we live.
[1:51:48] We we live in a time that I want the
[1:51:50] ball. I want this. I want No. Just say,
[1:51:53] "God, fill me with the Holy Ghost."
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, you be my guard to guide
[1:51:58] tower. Pray for the man behind behind
[1:52:00] the scenes."
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "But could you
[1:52:06] imagine a team so untrained today? We
[1:52:10] had the same thing. When you see God
[1:52:12] come on the scene, he's going to bless a
[1:52:14] certain thing. Let's keep all the
[1:52:16] enemies away from it.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Let us let us uh let let us use our
[1:52:23] influence as tackles, not runners.
[1:52:26] Tackles that protects the runner. Let us
[1:52:29] pack the ball through because there is
[1:52:31] no opposition. He said all you have to
[1:52:34] do is just to keep running
[1:52:37] and we should be the tackles. I tell you
[1:52:39] tonight, I want to be a tackle tonight.
[1:52:42] Everybody can't have a quarterback.
[1:52:43] That's what I'm here to tell you. You
[1:52:44] got the lineman. I guess you probably
[1:52:46] know football here, but I'm here to tell
[1:52:48] you, you got a quarterback and you got
[1:52:50] to protect them. And because if you
[1:52:52] don't protect them, they are going to
[1:52:53] get tackled. And I'm here to tell you to
[1:52:55] protect your vineyard tonight. If you
[1:52:57] believe the message of the hour and you
[1:52:59] everything that's within you, you
[1:53:01] protect it with all you got.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; May they play something softly tonight.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; May we just May we just think on that
[1:53:11] tonight? I hope that was okay. But
[1:53:14] May we protect this message with like he
[1:53:16] said may we protect it with all we got.
[1:53:21] If I could find that one more time what
[1:53:22] he said. He said this thing to do is to
[1:53:24] protect this message.
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:28] I believe we're living in an hour that
[1:53:29] you should be protecting this message.
[1:53:32] They're trying to tear it out of this
[1:53:33] saying this way saying that way. I'm
[1:53:35] here to tell you if it doesn't line back
[1:53:37] up the Bible as Galatians 1:8 says,
[1:53:42] "If even an angel preaches another
[1:53:44] message, let him be accursed." You make
[1:53:47] sure everything lines back up through
[1:53:48] God's filter. Make sure everything lines
[1:53:51] up through his word.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Make sure you protect your home. Make
[1:53:55] sure you protect your house.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Apply the token to your family tonight.
[1:54:00] Apply it to your family, your
[1:54:02] grandchildren, your lost one tonight.
[1:54:04] Stop letting the devil beat you around
[1:54:06] and say, "Well, I can't have them." No,
[1:54:08] you can have your inheritance tonight.
[1:54:10] It was given to you. You It was freely
[1:54:13] given to you tonight. May that encourage
[1:54:16] you tonight.
[1:54:18] All heads bowed.
[1:54:22] Maybe look, just say, "Brother Chris,
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:26] all these two services, they went by so
[1:54:28] quick."
[1:54:32] But maybe there's one person here
[1:54:33] tonight say, "Lord, fill me with the
[1:54:36] Holy Ghost.
[1:54:38] I've been away from my vineyard.
[1:54:40] I want to come back to you, Lord.
[1:54:45] I really want a real real experience."
[1:54:49] Oh, God bless you. God bless you.
[1:54:54] God bless you.
[1:54:57] Oh, just be real, God. No one looking
[1:54:59] around.
[1:55:01] Say, God, I want a real real deep
[1:55:03] experience with you.
[1:55:06] Oh, you see these hands.
[1:55:09] Oh God, if it's just for one soul in
[1:55:11] this church, it was worth it all.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:18] God, refill us, Lord. Maybe someone say,
[1:55:20] "I'm tired. I've been weary. I'm worn
[1:55:23] out. God, will you stop by my house
[1:55:26] tonight and say, "Lord, would you refill
[1:55:28] me?
[1:55:30] Would you refill me? Lord, I'm burned
[1:55:33] out. I'm tired. I'm weary.
[1:55:36] May he just come right now in your
[1:55:37] juniper tree and fill you."
[1:55:40] So, God, I I really need my joy. I need
[1:55:43] everything back tonight. God bless you
[1:55:45] tonight.
[1:55:47] God bless you.
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:52] However the Lord leads tonight,
[1:55:55] come forward. We can pray with you.
[1:55:58] If you have a need, whatever you have
[1:56:00] tonight, just as he sing a song, we
[1:56:03] invite you tonight. However the Lord
[1:56:05] leads
[1:56:08] as he sings tonight
[1:56:12] your presence
[1:56:17] fill us with your power.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Oh let Lord let God do a leading
[1:56:22] tonight.
