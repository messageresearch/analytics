========================================

morning brothers and sisters beautiful day to be in the house of god ask us all to stand please brother joe would you open us in service please amen children can be dismissed for sunday school ask us open our bibles to romans 2. we'll read verses 1 through 14. last one together that's romans 2. therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judges for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judges doeth the same things and thinketh thou this o man that judges them which do such things and doeth the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god but after the hardness and impenet heart treasureth up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god through them who by patient containence will do seek for glory and honor immortality eternal life tribulation and anguish upon every soul man that doeth evil of the jew first and also the gentile for there is no respect of persons with god we're not the hearers of the law or just before god but the but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature things contained into law these having the law are a law unto themselves brother troy god bless you this morning good to be in the house of lord just got uh sprung on real uh not so long ago here so you got the a little spare tire this morning for sunday school so but that's all right maybe we can gather something out of it uh i was just it was really fast and i i couldn't seem to put much together but um just thinking about the different things that we have to go through in life sometimes and how a lot of times we wouldn't choose to go through the things that we have to go through real hard times or real difficult times but it's uh what god usually does with us is he shapes us and molds us and basically breaks us down to uh to uh filter out all that dross like brother bran said how the the beater of the gold be and i was just thinking about everybody probably can reflect in their own lives different times where we didn't really know which way to turn or what to do and how it happened in brother branham's life uh you know when he lost his wife and he lost his little baby and uh and he was very down and he was um did not know which way to go or which way to turn but but as the one guy asked him as you stop there on the side of the road and ask him did you did your religion hold you brother branham brother adam said that that the lord held he didn't hold his religion but that lord held him basically and there's something inside of us the lord places into us when we have a new birth that holds us no matter if we know which way to turn or what to do or which way to go and i was thinking of the different stories brother tommy shared a message with me the other day and it was about how we go through highs and lows and we'll have hill tops and valleys and we'll have hill tops and we'll have valleys and if you look through the scriptures for all of god's people david had very highs in his life and then he'd have highs and he had very low places in his life and uh uh dave is one example uh elijah's another example where he had the mount carmel experience where he had challenged the the bail profits there he had great victories and then a couple uh chapters later he was found in in the cave and it says that he was thinking and contemplating about taking his own life and how god found him there and he said to him what does thou hear elijah he said to him and elijah was down and uh and elijah said well basically he's the only one he tried you know to do his best and he's the only one in all israel that's still for for the true god and and it was just a very low point in his life but uh but it was just to me it's just uh we can look back and see those people how they got through those things but obviously if you're anywhere and being a christian walked in the way a little while you know that you have to go through some hard times and our brother brandon said we weren't called to a picnic so we were called to a battlefield and uh yeah so as i said it was just a really short notice but let's uh if you want to turn with me to romans here romans 8. romans 8 and 35 and paul was another one of those he had a pretty good probably decent thing going there because he was he was uh very smart he was very educated he was persecuting the christians but uh he got put on his face there in there on the road to damascus and and when he met the pillar of fire and uh said paul paul why thou persecuted me and basically it changed paul's whole life and uh and he went there to uh and he went there to i think it was ananias there and he said there he wanted him to pray for him basically and it said that that he'll have to suffer great things for my namesake and paul did suffer great great things for for the namesake of christ but uh in romans 8 here 35 paul says this is that thing that holds you when you don't know exactly what to do it's a little like the little voice that it was not in when elijah was in the cave he wasn't answered by fire it wasn't answered by a whirlwind but a still small voice that said to him that that he knew and that's that little thing inside you that says when you don't know what to do and you don't know what to say when you don't know which way to turn there's something that holds you as like brother branson uh he went to say because because the devil was talking to him and saying uh you do all this stuff for the lord you gave your you gave your life you preach you do all these things for the lord but he took your baby and he took your wife and as brother brandon said he the devil was you know pestering him and wanted him to say why don't you just give it all up and don't serve them but there was that little thing that said though just like job when job had the same way the lord you know he just said basically that no matter what there's something inside me that keeps pressing on and keeps knowing and so romans 8 35 here paul says it who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress our persecution our famine our nakedness our peril our sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter they and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord and that's that small thing inside of every one of us that no matter where we are no matter what happens to us that we know that there's something that's changed in our lives that we're going to be moving to a new body and a new place somewhere that doesn't have all this struggle and tribulation and trials and it's the breaking point that we're in now is the breaking and breaking down of us to to make us into what we need to be to cross over so god bless you brother steve you good to be in the house and lord we do have a number out this morning brother brian got called out just right before service brother david's got a real bad nose bleed that uh seemed to have trouble getting it stopped so let's just remember him sister adriana's sick james williamson we had prayed for him earlier but he's still on the vent with colvid and uh but joe said remember sister hannah sister joyce and brother brad um moana luanna carr it's uh she was y'all worked with her at the nursing home uh she uh so just remember her family and friends and then sister sarah posted uh or she give me this says please pray for trevor hessen he is back in vanderbilt and has a hole in his esophagus that's setting up infection in it i've seen that on facebook so we definitely remember trevor this is he's been through a lot been and still going through a lot but just pray the lord have his will and way in his life and you know we never know what life is going to bring us uh but like brother troy was saying it's those ups and downs that is making us pliable for him to be able to work with us amen let's stand if we could scene number 83 lily of the valley i have found a friend in jesus he's everything to me he's the

it's all it'll take a minute it'll go pretty fast and we'll try to get that spread before the next rain comes amen and try to help so don't hillside don't wash out too much amen so praise the lord amen and that's all i can think of let's stand let's bow our heads lord jesus we just come before you once again lord thankful to you father for who you are lord to be able to come lord and stand behind this pulpit and to proclaim your greatness lord jesus and how awesome a god that you are thinking of that song that says we are what an awesome god our god is an awesome god when we think about you about glorifying you and that's what these services are for lord to bring honor and praise and glory to who you are and what you are father and we just can't brag about you enough we can't glorify you enough lord but lord as i feel god that i've got something i've kind of wanted to speak on right from the beginning on this series tonight i mean this morning we just pray lord that you'd help us lord jesus father just to say lord the things that each and every one of us has need of hearing and father that it would be a blessing to us and that we go from here are better people than what we've come lord lord we find ourselves way down the end of the road lord jesus from where he prophet was and from where he thought we would be and how long it would last lord but we just know that father you're with us even in us you've begun to work and you'll perform it until the day that you take us out of here lord we ask your blessing upon all those that are not feeling well this morning we ask god your blessing be upon them lord and raise him back up lord we rebuke that sickness in the name of jesus christ and believe that by your stripes we are healed lord those that are on vacation those are traveling and so forth we ask lord you to bring them back home safely and help them lord jesus have traveling mercies lord jesus be with us here and all those streaming lord jesus we ask god that you would bless each one listening in this morning in jesus name amen and amen god bless you amen we do want to greet the people streaming i know brother perish and sister perish then they're continuing to stream and perhaps once we're feel like this variant is gone and maybe we won't have so much of it amen people can come back again but amen we do want to be careful but amen and also suture peggy you mean god bless her this morning amen she's doing better a little bit better each all the time i guess and so we're glad to hear that but you know it takes a lot it takes a long time when you get up in age a little bit for to get healed so we just pray i'll touch her and continue to raise her up and her children and grandchildren amen god bless all of them amen so we just amen pray that god will just be with us now this morning uh i want to once to continue on our series amen so praise the lord we want to speak on something that i was going to at first i wanted to kind of speak on uh towards the beginning but i i mean i didn't get sidetracked but the lord just let me kind of in a different way with a few different ones i may enjoy that here this last time about the uh he's the all and you know that's what we talked about last time amen and how did you can see god he's everything and he's in everything amen he's all in all amen and he's our all in all he's our everything he has our all amen both great and small so but this morning we want to talk about uh a doorway jesus being the doorway amen and so if you will turn your bibles to saint john and then also i do want to this is the first of the month and i'm going to try to keep this going amen and that is to have communion every sunday every first month okay so we want to have the lord's communion this morning all those that want to partake of it amen to remember the lord he says this do in remembrance of mate amen and we want to obey him and certainly want to remember what he did for us for if it wouldn't have been for what he did we would not be here this morning so in saint john 10 we want to read the first [Music] verse and then jump down to verse seven okay verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber verse 7 then said jesus unto them verily verily i say unto you i am the store of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door amen tell me at least that's what god is he is the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pastor amen how many beliefs without christ you can do nothing amen you're not going to feed you're not going to eat right it's just not it's not going to work unless you are in christ amen the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly may god add his blessings to the reading the word you can be seated i want to touch on something that i don't really want to go too far down this road but i do want to mention this because i i felt like like when i was reading this that just it just kind of come to me and that is that when he talks about a thief cometh not but to kill him to kill and destroy you jump back up to verse verse one he says you know uh he that climbeth up some other way to see same as a thief and a robber right so when a person comes to christ perhaps wants to be a part of a church all right wants to come into christ be part of the assembly if you don't get into christ right if you don't get the baptism of the holy ghost for know this all you're going to do is cause destruction this is where you say amen amen how many knows that because you can't help it if you're not born again you will lean to your carnal nature notice i says if you come up some other way you're nothing but a thief and a robber you're just here to kill and to steal and to destroy that's the only reason you're there pretty strong isn't it amen but you have to be that now uh when we think about a door in a doorway amen and i you know how he knows jesus is the way right and many times we'll call that this area here this you know what can we you can call it a door right or what else is it that we call it thank you it's my title right yeah my door it's a doorway it's a doorway all right it's a way and it's a door why and that's for a purpose it's to go in and out it's either to go in or to come out and as i got to thinking about this and i got to think about everything that the bible talks about the door i almost in my own my own philosophy is that a door is almost as irrelevant as the the wheel amen because everything when you think about everything that encumbers the door and what in doorways it's about as about as much as what a wheel is you know because you can't get anywhere i mean it knows that when they invented the wheel they invented quite something i don't care if it's on a box wagon or what it was at least they didn't have to have a sleigh and drag it they could roll it it's pretty important so is doorways doorways are very very important amen and so we want to talk about that and then through the prophet's message we realized that he explained how that in the orient over there how that there is right there is an opening uh into this they have sheep and they call all the sheep through this this opening into a shelter perhaps right into a shelter and there is no door there's no door it's only a doorway right and brother branham describes he said that at night the shepherd will lay down in that opening right what does that mean that means that he becomes the door nothing can come in or nothing can go out but through him right and that's why jesus said you know there's an opening but listen i am the door i'm not i'm not the frame i'm not just the same but i am the actual door to the sheepfold something else that tells us that is there's no other way into this sheepfold but through the new birth but through christ right just becoming a church member putting your name on the book or whatever it is amen that's why you know we don't have any membership as far as a book with member number no no you become part of the body of christ through the new birth by one spirit are we all baptized into one body amen so if we're going to cover several different areas and you know being communion usually i like to quit about 12 or 12 15 but anyway we'll just go as far as the holy spirit leads this morning all right because there's so much that we could talk about in that area now if you want to uh uh brother bannon he preached a message i think it was in 62 called the key to the door key to the door amen it's very good amen and also there's something else we want to bring in with the help of the lord that is the key amen how many knows most doors have a key there's always a key going into a door so there's a door and then there's a key to the door right nami knows who had the key to the door huh say it out loud so i can really so you can really fail or be right peter right i give thee the keys to the kingdom of heaven you know jesus gave peter the keys to the kingdom he had the keys he knew how to get in because it's one thing to have a door that ought to be there but you've got to have a key to get in amen now let me ask you this what is the key faith are you sure well you're right that's right faith is the key to the lord amen because by faith isn't that right everything everything is by faith according to hebrews 11 by faith we understand by faith able by faith all of these great people did great things by faith without faith it's impossible to please god we are through by grace through faith right and that not of yourselves it's a gift of god so that's how we're saved is by grace through faith i mean you gotta have that faith amen my when we think about that it opens up an avenue it opens up a channel we know that there is a key to science now there's many different keys let's just talk about science for a little bit but i want to get into the spiritual part in revelations the fourth chapter and in the third chapter we're going to talk about a couple doors over there but the the key of science amen i mean another time there was a time we didn't have this right here hello hello you can hear me good now right they had to discover everything that had there had to be and thomas edison amen he was one of those who you know they probably might have thought that he was crazy to think that you take lightning huh like thomas like are like who was it uh benjamin franklin thought somehow that harness can be power he harnessed that thing somehow you know well we created our own uh lightning so to speak right our own electricity and so forth you know and and thomas he he thomas said he's man he just knew somehow that he can convert this power into making light huh now how many knows your brain your mind is a great door too your mind is a door that's right it's the womb to this it's a channel brethren calls even every one of your feelings and i want to go that towards the end i want to talk about but but every one of your emotions they're also they're all doors called channels just like that he's a channel amen you have to open that channel up just like you got to open that mind up in that right to receive whatever you're going to receive and that's why how many knows that's why the world is in the condition that is in because when rock and roll came out it opened up the channel of rebellion and it let all those swirling demons that come out of hell it lets them enter into their minds and in their hearts now we are where we are because they open up the channel they opened up the door of their mind and their heart amen praise the lord so that that's even the channel even though a channel of our mind and thomas edison he went and he worked and he worked and he worked now i don't know about you can i can just about hear thomas edison whenever he begin to get something that started to light up a little bit isn't that right i'd imagine he got a little happy when he realized hey this thing blew you know and this stayed on for 10 minutes before it blew if it stayed on one minute before it blew he probably got real happy because he knew he says if i can get it and keep it going 60 seconds i'm gonna keep it going forever huh well i don't know about you but hey i appreciate those who invented things don't you we're enjoying how many times do we look at the light and say thank you thomas i'm glad you had faith you lit up the whole world huh because one man opened up his mind in science and believed something that it could be done and on and on and on in the realm of military can you imagine brother if if if i was to go and join the military this morning and they would give me a muzzle loader huh how would you like it if you was handed a muzzle loader right i don't know about you i quit i quit why because i ain't got time i got a whole minute to reload your thing when they're spraying them at me literally spray how many knows that just spray they don't just shoot they spray him at you why because somebody believed that this thing can you know wasn't it a great thing when they come up with the revolver yeah the revolver was great when they come up with the revolver fish or hey guess what i can shoot six people with this thing now what have we got we got these little magazine that's got 30 in them they don't like for us to have 30. all right we're getting political right and y'all getting quiet but anyway that's right think about think about how that people believed something and knew that there was more whether it's four whether it was the engine whether it was the car how many knows hey one at one time no doubt that some of these fast sources could outrun that little mechanism you got rolling down the street there what is that funky looking thing you know i can go faster with my hearts you might have made fun of it but would they make fun of it today they hushed up a little bit when it comes to roaring roared past them left them sitting there huh i'm sorry i'm gonna be just a little bit honest whenever i get to push the gas pedal to get up there just pass the buggy a little bit and go i'm like poor guys poor guys they think they still gotta do that yeah you got to do that i hope you enjoy it i like a good old-fashioned buggy ride but it's just going to be a pleasure ride for me all right but that's the truth right think about the science world look at what opened up because of the door of science even the prophet talked about that it opened up the science of war how many know nowadays brother brown he said makes a statement that you really can't even have war anymore that's right and you know you know what wars for war is for for countries that don't have nuclear capability pretty much why because we don't mess with russia we don't mess with cuba we don't mess with china we don't mess with people ultimately we know what's going to happen if you push too hard right you can't have war you can't do it why because you don't want to go there amen it's only for afghanistan these all these countries that don't have that yet well you can go push them around a little bit and so forth but anyway so even there look at where that's gotten look at where that has went to the complete you know i can't really imagine but we know that especially during ronald reagan's time we know that they were in a disarmament and getting rid of them because we they just had too much there was just there was enough there to destroy this earth too many times not once but too many times i mean you could have burned it over six seven i don't know how many times but the man says if they let go of that there wouldn't be what what did he say brother man something about there wouldn't be a green blade of grass anywhere it didn't fry at all amen so that's where it is in science because they worked at it they believed it could be done and it was and because even we believe that it could be none if y'all ever did the uh uh study on how they got to build this nuclear bomb and the city they built and everything that they went through and the scientists until they got it and saved a lot of american lives isn't that right because we made them jobs give up after a couple of bombs dropped hey man i'm not sure but i think that's probably the only two bombs ever dropped right isn't that quite something you know there's a lot of tests but i don't know that anybody ever use them again because they know how danger it is you know your your mind in my mind can't imagine but brother i am talking about how to like whenever uh you know if they would let some of those gold the hole would be about 100 feet deep and hundreds of miles wide or whatever it put a almost cracked the earth open to he talked and of course of course perhaps bring the lava out maybe that's what it'll take to make the earth new again because we gotta get this all covered up somehow don't we we gotta get this mess covered up someday we ain't gonna live in this in the millennium but the power what i was trying to say was is the sheer power of hiroshima and nagasaki it's a hundred times from what i understand 100 times more powerful and if that would take the whole city out a hundred times take a whole state out think about that and then how many of those they have all hanging in the hangars brother john waiting for some guy to just get upset had enough brother branham called pulling the lever i don't know if it's a lever or button but whatever it is when one goes isn't that right china huh china and and if somebody just lets it go and because you know we the bride won't be here for that amen but anyway that's in the world and that's the door of science and that's how far they have went everything from radio to television to everything that you can imagine that we didn't know existed even the band said existed back then but she just now discovered it cars driving by themselves amen how many i think brother david was telling me about his and brother jeff probably about you can hit the auto and it just drives you down the road you know good luck with that i like to drive myself but i'm gonna hurt myself i want it to be my own doing no i don't say i wouldn't you know if there wasn't too much traffic around maybe something but i'm telling you but look at it you know i think brother uh tommy sent me something of that little thing that they fly like a hovercraft what did they call that the jet okay the jet ski or something jet son yeah you know the jetson little flyer thing while they come up with that now you know people come you know just all all kinds of signs that people thought maybe never would happen huh but yet becoming what would we discover now i believe if i'm not wrong brother branham talked about science tapping into uh that they're trying to find the source of life is that right and brother bam says if we aren't careful they'll find it before us preachers do right what really brings life and what makes life because we're supposed to have that life already we know what makes life we know that it's god right i believe it was einstein isn't that right he was looking for it and he was trying to figure it out all and he come up with a conclusion is god by faith you know we understand that worlds were framed by the word of god that was pretty much his conclusion from what i understand he found it he found out hey there's only one that's got there's got to be god i think it's a pretty smart scientist whenever they figure out that it takes god to do it all i don't have too much to say for the guy that thinks it evolved okay i don't think they're very intelligent to say the least you should know better than that you know it didn't amen all right let's go to revelations with me will you revelations and we'll go to the third chapter revelations 3 verse 7. all right remember revelation 3 verse 7 it says and to the fellow and then to the angels of the philip philadelphia right he thinks saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shut up and shutteth and no man openeth how many believes that when god opens the door it's going to be open ain't nobody gonna shout it and when he shuts the door it's gonna be shut ain't nobody gonna open it i know thy works behold i have set before thee and open door and no man can shut it for thou has a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name amen now this was just before the laodicea age he was talking about the door that was going to be open in front of him before the head of the there's an open door you can go back to church agents due to search and study of what brother graham all explained about what that was but it was about christ opening the door and bringing us back to himself amen in other words how many of those martin luther and during that right during that time era oh they wanted to kill martin luther for standing up against them how many knows back in the dark ages folks if you we was sitting here back in the dark ages we didn't know when the cops were going to come and drag us out of here you're not allowed to worship like this you come and you bow and you kiss the crucifix or we'll kill you we'll feed you to lions we'll burn you at the stake folks i don't even want to go into the description how horrible it is with pregnant women and everything else they did folks he was a nightmare it was a complete horror down through a thousand years the catholicism had a thousand years where it seemed like the door to religious freedom was shut but how many know that was the opening god says i'm going to open the door amen you're going to get out of this and i don't care how much the pope brings to martin luther in front of him and how many others that get killed during that time because a lot of them did is that right that's a headache but god was opening the door and there ain't no pope there ain't no devil in hell want to shut it amen and if you no matter how much the devil tried no matter how much they tried to shut it down they could not shut it down and the revival spurred and here it comes isn't that right because it was time for rev restoration amen and openly you talk about opening a door are you talking about opening our eyes and everything that come along with it i'm rejoicing because of that scripture right there this morning you're rejoicing because god opened the door that no man can shut oh how many knows that in our age whenever brother brandon preached the seals and he preached a breach and talking about there's no mercy once those seals are broke that he stands up but he takes it it sounds like hey folks if you want to go to seed on something get some false doctrine that's a good place to start well he said you know when those shields are broke there's no more mercy and so forth and then different ones were saying look we don't need preachers anymore do we you know there's nobody going to be saved anymore should we work anymore brother ben says don't you ever quit working you keep on going you the door is open god will close the door amen not you amen so here we are still working but when god closes the door it's going to be shut when that last one comes in it's going to be all over with i'm going to believe that i'm glad that door's still open some of us need it isn't that right our loved ones need it any of our loved ones that aren't in yet they need that door to stay open amen i was calling come on come on come in for the door still well let's see why you still can praise be to god amen anything now i'm going to say this when anything that god does anything that he does the devil can't stop you think about well back in pharaoh's time perhaps how many knows in the days of pharaoh they were killing all the male children because they had heard that there was a deliverer born right they went and killed all the babies they were trying to shut this door they don't want no delivery airborne huh they wanted to try to get him could they do it no one of you all should tell me the story but i guess i will since i'm the preacher well what did god do he took the deliverer and made pharaoh raise him how are you talking about a good one brother jim that was a good one i mean it wasn't a pharaoh's daughter right she was out there bathing or something out there in the river and saw a little baby come around there and had the servants grab that baby now go find me a wet mother and found the very mother oh my god the raised moses right there right under pharaoh's nose oh my that's god for you and then what happened poor guy later on there moses grew up did they get him no they didn't get it he went out there for a while had to be out there on the backside of the desert and get his good lesson teaching from god right and when god decided here this is the time for your deliverance go down in egypt get in front of pharaoh and tell him to tell by tell the pharaoh to let my people go folks when god says something it's best just to fall in line because if you don't but you're going to be fighting god folks i'm here to tell you something right now to make a long story show there's a lot of people that fight god they fight what's right don't even know it how about the church world how many knows the church world wouldn't even let people come to brother bannon's meeting and where christ himself was coming down in the congregation discerning thoughts and tense of the heart amen and excommunicate they were fighting on didn't even realize it anybody that fights god's program remember this they are fighting god trying to shut down what god is doing the devil loves to try to shut down what god is doing the devil does [Music] oh my but it's god's not going to have it is he it's not going to happen you're only going to find yourself in chaos fighting god over in the book of acts it happened remember remember there was a big uproar in the book of acts and there was a lot of them saying this and a lot of them saying that and they wanted to get peter and all of them you know but and get rid of them but there stood one up in the council a pharisee named gamalia a doctor a real scholar a real wise guy and he was actually smart here right because he went to talking about acts 5 and verse 20 34 he goes to talking about all the different people that had come and proclaimed themselves to be a somebody amen and holiday took and let 300 people or 3 000 people out and most of them got killed or died or and then another one came and they fell apart right they came to naught in verse 37 after this man rose up judas of galilea galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away many much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this council or this work be of men it'll come a night it'll come to nothing but if it be of god you cannot overthrow it hallelujah least happily you be fine to fight even against god oh my how many can say this morning you fight against the message of the hour you're fighting against god's open door you're fighting against god lord help us right was it herald i believe it was that killed all the little babies thinking he could get rid of the king of the jews because he had heard that there is a king born among the jews he took your caring tried to get rid of him he never got rid of him can't do it he can't prevail against god when he opens the door it's open how many knows a lot of times things will happen in our lives we don't know why well i'll tell you sometimes we do know why because we did it ourselves right but sometimes we don't know why but let me tell you something how many knows when it seems like completely shut down in one place but if god is with you know this he will open up another door how many believes he does that he supplies for us you might get fired but guess commit yourself to god god will give you another job god will open up a door he's very intricate about dealing with each and every one of us about the how many beliefs i don't know about you but he's opened many a doors for me he's closed doors he's open doors folks i'm not going to try to make my own door i know people that try to make their own doors and make their own way and it's a clam of day yeah that's what it is it's a calamity but if you'll follow god when he opens the door and what he does oh it's awesome praise be to god this morning aren't you glad for that that when he opens the door nobody can shut it how many knows for 2 000 years everything's ever since christ came even the apostle paul was trying to shut down the church he was trying to shut it up ain't nobody a new bunch of heretics i'm gonna come i'm gonna arrest you it's like trying to go out there in a wheat field that's burning and taking a a a a blanket and swashing it out and then the sparks fly over the other wheat and every time you go like god it spreads out ten feet and woof oh my god i can't do that again right the more they try to put the fire out the higher it shoots that's the way with the gospel amen paul he would bring a bunch of prisoners in and he found out hey as you hear there's a hundred of them got curved converted over a glacial over in ephesus they're rising up a bunch over there huh paul was fixing to be a real busy man but thank god god got a hold of him amen said isn't it hard for you to kick against the pricks huh i don't know about you but kicking against the prick i don't know the exact interpretation but a prick for my understanding is something a sticker or something and you kick against that ouch it's going to hurt it doesn't avail that's what he was doing you know jesus said why are you persecuting me and paul said who art now lord huh it was paul's first revelation who food a man jesus really was wasn't it he never really had the revelation how it how paul managed to make it through all of the time that jesus walked the shores of galilee lazarus being raised from the dead opening up the blind and all of that and all of that and yet none of them at no time was he converted at no time did he become jesus as followers not until after he was gone risen again amen come back in the pillar fire was in his church and then paul began to persecute the christians began to try to put the fire out fighting against the program of god and let me tell you something christians were scared of him they were scared of the man when somebody said he got saved he's one of us let me tell you it was a real sticky feeling when you come around to walking into the church there and father why where is he so high i don't believe it i'm doubt thomas for sure right a lot of people didn't believe it some of the different ones had to acknowledge yes god has done a work for him he had become one of them amen and after that we find somebody else working against him who was it saul's or paul's peers some of those votes that were helping him perhaps and cheering him on is that right say what but he's one of them now what he's a heretic we'll kill him right 12 men or so quite a 15 men i believe it was the bible talks about had sworn an oath that they would not eat until paul was not breathing anymore you talk about somebody be hammering about stopping the fire can we smile this morning and say they got pretty hungry probably you're gonna get hungry if you start fighting against god and say you ain't gonna eat until a certain man did amen no it's not gonna work didn't work did it they laid in waiting everything else but it didn't work amen doors how many he is the door when daniel was thrown into lions then what was his way out the fire was there it was the avenue by which he escaped how many knows jesus said i am the way he's the way he's the door he's the way he's the direction he's the way out he's the way of escape he himself is the three hebrew children when they were cast into the fiery furnace amen who was it that saved him the fourth man god himself he was their channel he was their doorway he was their way out their doorway he was the way he's their way out amen many times in the bible you think about the way out the bible even says he says you know how to talk about he says you know if you're tempted he doesn't tempt anybody or put anything on anybody but makes what a way of escape he is our shelter he's our escape he is our escape route another scripture let's go to the next one chapter four after this revelations chapter four after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and a voice which i heard was in that word a trumpet talking with me which said come hither and i will show you things which must be hereafter how many times the proper guy told us that the church goes up in revelations the third chapter she's taken up there he's raptured but look at what happens here there was an open door and verse two and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and three sat on the throne the folks out there can't hear you no it doesn't say three right it says one sat on the throne and what happened after this read the whole chapter read the next few chapters what is it it's the opening up of the seals a door was open god began to pull out his revelation and show us the mystery of the whole thing how many knows when those seals broke there was an opening even brother man talked about his ministry was being those seals and the revelation of those because it was in the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen he says as it was today hold on since happened since i can't remember it i'll just go to it i should remember it getting older 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophets his ministry was to open up those mysteries that god had amen remember the angel said go back to jeffersonville and the seventh hills will be open god began to open up and show us where we come from what the whole plan was it was a door to open up and even to show you your name think about it john how many knows john the rebel and he says he saw his name and begin to rejoice how do you see your name how do you see your name this morning did somebody want to ask me that question brother tell me how do you see your name there you can see your name when your life identifies with this word i don't believe that we are identified with this word i'm just glad for that now if your life doesn't compare if it's a hypocrite or if it's not what according to the word you can't really identify yourself but when you know that christ has come down and you have went through the door that you're supposed to go through amen and god has honored you god has had respect upon your sacrifice upon what your repentance amen you begin to become identified that you are a believer that your name is you are a part of the bible you are a part of god your name is there because of who you identify with what you identify with remember peter was given what the keys plural keys to the kingdom he's maybe there's more in one way but i'm talking about how that in a key there's different little locks different things it has to all line up for it to open the door right certain way when peter on the day of pentecost when he had the keys to the kingdom and those men began to ask they were pricked in their hearts right after he peter preached to him and told him that they had uh killed the only he had to kill killed him the messiah and so forth then their preakness now what shall we do in other words which way are we gonna go what are we supposed to do kind of like when you're in a house ever been in somebody's house and you say well which way do i go out or which way is the bathroom or which door which which door is the exit here right which door do i take that's what they were asking which door do i take what do i got to do to be saved what did peter say number one repent right that's turn around and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the holy oath repentance and remissions of sins and the baptism of the holy ghost that is the true entrance to the sheepfold how many believes that you can't come any other way that's the only way to come anybody tells you come as you are stay as you are is a liar you're a liar you're demon devil inspired how many of you don't stay like you are you come as you are that's exactly right but you don't stay as you are you're not willing to repent the fire will never consume your sacrifice you'll never get the holy ghost you'll never get born again in your soul no you won't you've got to come the right way you come by him how many know if the devil would come the right way huh if he'd come the right way and get saved like you are then he'd be your brother you say shake hands say boy god really is generous isn't he he really is mercy fellaini huh that's right but we know he's not gonna he don't do that huh praise be to god one more scripture let's go and talk about the uh the way for a minute he is the door and he is the way let's take a few minutes on this in saint john 14 let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house or many mansions if it were not so i would have told you isn't that something how did jesus begin to tell his disciples that you know in his father's house there's big big mansions i don't want your heart to be troubled i don't want you to be afraid let me tell you that this morning evening like tabernacle don't let your heart be troubled and don't let it be afraid don't don't let it you're in the door you're a part of the sheepfold lord willing maybe if the lord leads me this way wednesday night we'll talk about the good shepherd the good shepherd but listen he's telling them that i've got there's a house there's mansions in there and i go in other words this is the first time that the disciples begin to get a little worried this is where they begin to not like so much about what he was talking about because if you'll find out later he says you keep talking about going away we don't like the idea of you going away how many people didn't like the idea of him going away he thought they were going to overthrow those those romans you know and set up a kingdom and all of that that wasn't the avenue that wasn't the channel can we say something this morning and that is they had a preconceived idea of how things were supposed to go and it didn't go that way at all boy don't we have that a lot of times we have a preconceived idea of hide out of being and when it's not that way we get flustered don't get flustered say god adjust to my mind to what it's supposed to be but he begin to tell him that he's going to leave him you know i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and i prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there be you may be also the disciples ought to have a jumping jubilee running around the pulpits in their platform and everything they should have fit because if the man christ jesus would have looked at me and he said thomas i'm gonna go away in the father's house there's many many actions i'm gonna go away but if i go away i'm gonna come again and i'm gonna receive you under myself that's good enough for me [Applause] i'm happy i'm good will you make it that's right just to have and tell you that i'm going away but i'm gonna come again and receive you unto myself praise be to god huh and then he stops and he goes in different directions with the whole message he says [Music] so that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know and the way you know thomas sayeth unto him lord we know not whether our goal is and how can we know the way thomas's mind is off somewhere he's going to go to where in the world he going to go and how do i get there jesus said just got finished telling them you know the way you know where i'm going and you know the way chris this morning for you how is it that they knew the way somebody tell me how they knew the way hand up you feel like you have it this morning i got the answer brother how did they know the way and the way you know this is pretty easy who's the way there you go i am the way in other words you know the way you know me right you all know me so you know the way right he says the way you know because i am the way and you know me but they in their minds weren't thinking quite right were they thomas i mean not thomas but peter already said the heart to christ the son of the living god we believe you're the messiah how many day believed he was the messiah [Applause] thomas after he touched his hands and his side knew without a doubt that that was his lord all right how can we know jesus saith unto him i am the way if you know me you know the way the truth and the life amen let me know that people just don't know what truth is anymore people don't know what's true anymore there's only one truth that's this right here this is the truth you want to know the truth world you want to know the truth right here it is you can acknowledge it now or you can acknowledge it later but you will acknowledge it unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess amen heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away he is the truth and the life how many knows that's truly what every church wants is eternal life right anybody who wants to be a christian has a thirst in their heart to live eternally there's only one way that's going to happen and that is to have the life of christ in your heart and no man cometh unto the father except by muhammad buddha or any other way no but by amen praise be to god i like that don't you so jesus is the door way he is the way he is the door brother brahm says there's only one door to healing and jesus is that door i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases i don't care how much penicillin i don't care how much medicine you take it is still jesus that heals you so when you get better don't you never get better without saying thank you jesus for healing me jesus healed me amen how many has been healed by jesus every hand in here has been healed by jesus if you've lived very long because even as children we got sick amen and we've been healed aren't you be glad for that no man cometh unto the father but by me you can't go in any other way you can't come any other way other than by the door of jesus christ you got to come through what is that the baptism of the holy ghost that's who jesus christ is he that hath the son hath life he that had not the son hath not life paul said now they that have not the spirit of god they are none of his he is our healing as he says i am the lord thy god that heals all thy diseases he is the door to heaven and there's no other door no other way but through jesus christ he is the door to heaven he says and now jesus is the door to all of these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door listen to this because i'm sure that we've already been unlocked the door to salvation but listen to this if jesus is the door to all these promises of god faith in his finished work then faith unlocks every door to every treasure that is inside the kingdom of god if any man i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture i mean how many knows it's important to have your cattle or sheep even that they have grass that they have plenty of food they don't have food they starve to death if you don't aren't coming to christ you can't find pasture every good thing is opened up to you whenever you have faith and you come into christ you love the lord this morning amen then the next verse talks about i am the good shepherd perhaps we'll get into that next lord willing amen and i like this because listen the thief doesn't come the devil don't come to bless you he don't come to make you better and may give you a better life he just comes to kill to steal your joy to kill you give you a sorrow heartache he's he's got a troll of treasure himself but his treasure is depression it's sorrow it's emptiness it's death amen oh not much of a treasure is it amen praise the lord all right let's stand if you will this morning the last door in closing that i want to talk about for just a minute found in revelations 3 where jesus said behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open up i will come into him and will set with him and he with me how many knows that you have many doors in your life but god comes i believe to every heart [Music] and he now at your heart store it might be when you're driving down the road just meditating on something and all of a sudden the door will knock the lord will say something to you that's you know it's only the lord saying something to you but he'll be knocking he comes on knocking on your door and it's up to you whether you open up to him and let him into your house open up that avenue open up the door of your heart the door of your mind say lord jesus come in ask yourself this morning this question have you opened every door of your heart and open it up and say lord jesus come in for i know that you stand at the doorknock you want to gain entrance to ours as the artists paint that paint that picture of a door with only a handle on the ins side no doorknob and the critic says you know it's a great picture of jesus knocking on the door but what in the world happened here we ain't got no doorknob he says no it's meant to be that way he don't just push his way in or kick the door down he knocks and you're the only one that can turn that handle that can say yes lord i know that's you speaking to my heart and open it up and say come on in lord get rid of everything that's unlike you make your abode in my life come into my heart come into my heart come into my heart lord jesus come in today come in to stay come into my heart or jesus how many would say lord just come into my heart this morning come into every door every area of my life every door of my life lord i want you to have free reign in my house living room kitchen bedroom it doesn't matter where it is lord you have the free reign make yourself right at home here use my heart use my mind use my thoughts keep my my eyes on the right thing keep my mind thinking the right thing use me lord jesus use this house to live in father we have our hands raised saying we open up our hearts door this morning for you to come in and to stop with us and us with you how sweet it is to be able to suck with our lord and to also partake of his communion this morning god what an honor it is to be able to remember what you did for us on calvary lord we would have been out there in the world we'd have been out in sin and drugs and everything else lord there had never been a way for us to get free of that if it would have been for the door that you yourself come and opened made available to us father we thank you lord jesus for your mercy and grace we ask god come into our hearts leaving us and have your way now and as we change the order to service this morning we ask god that you'll bless the communion that we're about to take in the name of jesus christ is remember you amen and amen open your bibles if you will we'll just get into the communion part over into first corinthians first corinthians 11. verse 23 paul says for i have received the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this dude in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had subbed saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink of this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink of damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest i said in order when i come let's have a more a moment of silence as you judge yourselves confess all your sins and make sure you're right before the lord before coming and taking of the communion amen amen all those that want to partake of the communion come over to our right like we usually do the remain can be seated if you want to
