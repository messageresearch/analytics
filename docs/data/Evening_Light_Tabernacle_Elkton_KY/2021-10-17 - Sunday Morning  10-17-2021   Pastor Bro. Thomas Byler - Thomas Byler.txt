TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my good morning brothers and sisters if we'll go ahead and stand dismiss for the other sunday school classes at this time if i didn't do it right now i'd probably forget if brother powell would open in a word of prayer before we get started is amen if you return with me to for the bible reading the 12th chapter of ecclesiastes please there's only 12 verses here i know i get in a hurry so i'm taking that extra second to give you all a chance to get to that chapter all right i'll start with the first verb remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years drawer nigh when thou shall say i have no pleasure in them and in that day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows be dark also when thou shalt be afraid afraid of that which is high and fear shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and the desire shall fall because men goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught to people knowledge yay he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many proverbs and the words of the wise are as goats and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies which are given from one shepherd [Music] and let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man for god shall bring every work into judgment with every seeking thing which is to be good or whether it be evil amen you can be seated you know you uh you just you can't get away from god's wisdom in the word of god the truths that are in it and then if you return with me to uh this morning to timothy ii timothy the third chapter it's a chapter everyone knows pretty good but i was sitting there this morning i was listening on my old eyes style ipod the you don't even see them i don't know i still use that in my office i still use that that old one the white one you know i just continually scroll through messages i just turned my ipod player on and just let us listen to what brother brown was talking about and one of these messages i can't tell you the date or the hour but he was talking about how how the world is gonna one day our country and the countries of the world are gonna be consumed and taken over by whether you call it whatever you call it one world government or something and i was listening to them talk about how it would happen and then you come 50 years later and that's it was 1960 1961 where were almost 60 years later depending on when you were born from that point and when you look at the world out there you can see the the roots of it and everything you turn now you can see the roots being manifested in the in the thing and you the way that our governments are falling the way people are falling it's like brother brad and brother thomas have been saying it's not going to get any better it's only going to get worse and the worst thing that the your enemy is doing to you and to the normal person outside is destroying your confidence and once you destroy a man or woman's confidence in his government in his town in his schools or in the natural sense you destroy that man or that woman if you destroy his confidence in the church you destroy him spiritually so when you destroy both of those organizations you actually destroy their ability to trust what they hear and to respond to it when they have no trust in any of that they're in a bad position they don't know which way to go and that's a horrible place to be and i was just reading this and listening to what he had to say and you can see it in our own government in our own country and and i wrote these notes down this morning and i was thinking what we have a difference in this message of the hour i hadn't even started reading yet that you you have to have confidence that you know the that you have the vision for the message of the hour that you live in what god has to reveal that to you if you have that confidence then you have that spark in your soul and that spark in your life no matter what happens you have a vision to see what yourself on the other side and if you don't have that then you're going to be just like everyone out in the world you're not going to have any confidence or any foundation so let me just read a few of these scriptures and uh i'm not going to i'll try not to read this whole chapter i know i say that and i do it anyway but uh starting at the third chapter of second timothy and i'll just read a few this know also that in the last days curious time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous posters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents and unthankful and unholy and when you think of that don't think of your neighbor just think of your your environment what you live in we all have different types of jobs we all intermingle every day with different type of people put yourself in in the scriptures and i don't mean put yourself in a bad way that you're doing this but you're around people that are doing this every day of your life it goes on for men should be lovers of their own selves covetous posters plowed vast themes disobedient to parents and unthankful and unknowing without natural affections true spirituals false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good and that goes back to what i was originally saying that if outside of their your relationship with jesus christ and outside of your knowledge of the word everything out there in the world the foundations are breaking every day it gets worse every day you can't have any confidence in what's out there and that's what's what paul is saying here and he goes on the side they're despisers of those good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away so he's he's not just talking about the natural man out there but he's also talking about the church itself too and he goes on to say for for this order they would creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins laid away with divers lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of truth you know i used to think about that when i was younger that scripture i just read a lot and if you look at any ministry you can see the difference i i've listened to uh you know sometimes i spend a lot of time on the road so i've just turned the christian radio station on in the last 30 years 40 years i listened to these same ministers and what they said 30 years ago and what they say today is not the same thing but you have the same message there's no change in the message every hour that you have it's steady and it's a rock it doesn't change you just believe what was said but that the church out there they're ever changing they're never coming to a true knowledge of the truth he goes on to say now it's janice and james with stood moses so that these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds represent reprobates concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be made manifest on to all men as there also was that goes back to what i was saying if if you weren't in the message of the hour which doesn't make you better than anyone else you wouldn't have no vision to see what's going on on the face of the earth you wouldn't see the corruption you wouldn't see the lying and the misrepresentation of the gospel the way it is out there in the world you you'd just be like them it's just by grace that god chose you that's and it doesn't make you better than anyone else and it goes on to say for that was fully known my doctrine and manners of life purpose faith longsuffering charity and patience so paul's he's not lifting he's paul's not really lifting himself but he's using himself as an example for the believers to see what you know the good looks like and what the bad looks like and persecutions and afflictions that came on to me and antioch forgive my pronunciation and like them and listeria and lester with persecutions i don't endure but of all of them the lord delivered me yay and all and he goes on to say here i know this is hard sometimes to the flesh but it's truth yay all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution you know people might not like you when you make a testimony for truth when you tell that man you're working with you're not going to lie for him because you're a christian you're not going to fudge on his hours you're not going to overpay him for work that he didn't do in the world we live in right now you'll make an enemy real quick just having a simple honesty and simple christian principles about the way you work or the way you deal with people will make you enemies in the day it goes on the say here even men seducers shall lack worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou and things with foul has learned and thou has been assured of knowing that of whom thou has learned them and he goes on to talk to timothy here and say that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures but you're able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus you know i was just thinking about what i said the hardest thing for some of you young men and young women when you're working around people that say they're christians that have a bad example when you know that they're not doing the work they should be doing not doing the things you're not supposed to let stuff like that be a stumbling block that shouldn't change your perspective shouldn't make you work any harder study any harder should make you just be straight as a rock and walk down the straight path i'm using their work sense but in a christian sense when you're doing in your prayer life don't let other people's looseness affect you you just stay on the straight path and just walk whether they're going to follow you or not you can't make them follow you you just got to choose to just take one step at a time no matter what people tell you he goes on to say here from a child out known the holy scriptures were able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus and all scripture and this is what you have to hold on to in the age of 11. brother adam said this in many different ways all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that jesus is like you said you got to see yourself in the scripture that that the man of god may be perfect for finished onto all good works and i just wrote a few notes here this morning as i was listening to that message he was talking to canadians about america how it was going to be taken over and i was listening to it you know being overseas and going all the places i have when you when you see the things they did in third world countries they're starting to do in your own country you can see that you're at the end but i was just writing some things but you have some rules on the road that god gave you for the prophet of the hour and i everyone knows this i say this a lot you know in a lot of messages brother branham said your abcs always believe christ and that might some of your people you deal with out there the world might call you a simpleton because you you're always going to believe what the word of god says no matter what they tell you but that's the truth y'all always going to believe christ you're always going to believe the word of god you know brother branham said also read your bible and pray every day that's another rule of the road you have to do that if you don't do that every day you're not going to be successful and uh the last thing i'll finish with a lot of people preachers have been dealing with you know that token has to be applied in your life if you don't have that token in your life like i said just when i started you're going to be all over the plate you know i mean you're not gonna be able to hit the ball it's not gonna happen you have to have the token in your heart and in your life and then from there you'll be successful are you gonna have rough spots on the road i can't say whether you are or not but if you have the token if god has taken over your heart and life you have all the tools you need to be successful brother one be back in the house of the lord we'll just sing 585 what a money god we serve [Music] what a mighty god we serve what a

house of lord good to see everybody out this morning amen in the house of the lord amen i know there's different ones have a little touch perhaps of coba or perhaps have uh maybe just even question whether it is colbert and we certainly want everybody to be cautious amen at this time for sure amen because i know this stuff's just certainly going around and we're thankful that we're not experiencing more than what we are we certainly did the last go around didn't we amen well i'm just hoping that once you had it you don't get it no more right but we don't need that again right no we don't want that again you know so i know martha had it bad i guess for us so i'll tell you what amen so we're just hopefully hopefully that does it you know hopefully we don't get another one amen but anyway so see i mean perilous times we're living in isn't it amen certainly are but we're so happy amen because we serve a god that amen makes things non-perilous when it's perilous right amen god bless you all this morning let's just bow our heads go before the lord in prayer gracious and kind heavenly father we do thank you lord for another opportunity lord to be able to come lord we think of brother biscuits up there in the different places in canada and so forth that you know from what i understand it's pretty much shut down lord jesus we just thankful to have a house that we can come lord and worship you in spirit and truth lord and father to be able to lord read your word lord and to get closer to your lord to search our hearts to see if we're where we ought to be lord and how can we approve and how can get closer to you lord father to be able to approach your throne of grace lord desiring forgiveness of any failures or shortcomings lord jesus when we fall we can get back up lord jesus we just ask god this morning that you'll bless the meditation of a heart lord and something that's been kind of uh lord you've been kind of brewing up so to speak in my heart for the last several weeks lord and i just want to take that course with your help lord this morning and see what you will have father in the next few services lord with this and we just ask god for your guidance for your leadership both with the speakers and the years of the hearer lord and may we feed from your manna this morning lord jesus may we go from here lord being satisfied spiritually because of you feeding us lord we ask god these blessings and favors in jesus name amen and amen and bless all those that are not feeling well amen so i last little while i've been kind of thinking on a on an avenues that i think years ago i ministered on that i'd like to do again i don't know how many services it'll be but maybe a little mini series again i haven't done no mini series for a while amen but this will kind of be a continuance also of i mean he that is in you amen we're gonna talk about the lord and what i want to try to do for the next few services uh is speak on god's attributes amen god's attributes amen and so uh i asked brother william to sing that song because that's the song that came to me and he says well i already got it wrote down so we'll just move it to the end i just like that you know at first i thought well maybe i should just leave it you know but i said no i think it'd be all right so anyway it all worked out for the good you know and so it goes let's talk about jesus the king of kings is he the lord of lord supreme through all eternity he's the great i am the way the truth the life the door amen i mean at least we have an awesome god amen so that's what we want to talk about we're talking about jesus he that is in you we want to talk about him for the next few services would that be okay let's talk about jesus more and more amen let all the world proclaim the power and majesty of such a precious name the babe of bethlehem the bright and morning star let's sing his praises near and far let's talk about jesus the bread of life you see the savior of the world the man of galilee the prophet the priest the king the mighty god is he the well of living water free amen praise the lord amen let's talk about it the prince of peace is he the great physician too down through all history they're literally pure and white the rose of sharon fair the shepherd of such tender care amen let's talk about jesus the rock of ages he the lamb for sinner slain the man of calvary the great emmanuel the word of god sublime he is a bridegroom so divine amen i believe somebody else had a revelation amen of what our lord really is amen so if you will turn your bibles this morning to the book of ephesians amen and with the help of the lord i debated on on on a couple little different thoughts i wanted to talk about the eagle aminos he is jehovah eagle he types himself as the eagle amen also we know that even a lot of different nature things in nature represent the lord jesus christ represent god like the lion the eagle a lamb uh a dove right there's a lot of different things that he created that display his attributes amen but in ephesians um chapter 1 and we'll begin with reading 17 and this morning we want to talk about him as a warrior all right or a mighty conqueror how many believes he's the conqueror he's a warrior he's a soldier amen and we want to look at him as that amen so maybe wednesday we'll look at him as the eagle amen and in the eagle we want to talk about how that that eagle is a special built bird amen and we want to talk about some of the materials that it's made out of amen and so uh but anyway this morning we want to focus pretty much on uh him as a warrior a man or a soldier amen the mighty conqueror the savior the messiah amen so that's kind of the area that we want to go in ephesians chapter 1 and verse 17 that the god of our father the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his heart of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places now notice he's far above all principalities and powers and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also that is what which is to come and hath put all things under his feet in other words he conquered everything amen oh my and he gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of all that filleth all in all in revelations 2 i mean you know it's revelations one i wrote down two but it's chapter one revelations chapter one verse 16 says and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last amen there's another attribute right that's something else that he is he's the first he's the last i'm he that liveth and was dead wow what a statement for god to make i am alive but i was dead i'm the first and the last amen and i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death may god that is blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning i guess there is a something that i can't testify that i know and that is what it's like to be a soldier right naturally speaking anyway now i could tell you some stories have already and maybe told you too many times you know what way i know i'm getting old it's when i keep repeating myself [Laughter] oh yeah well have you ever noticed that about old folks a lot of times they'll tell you a story over and over you know you're like hey you told me that five times already i know the story so i watched myself i'm like like don't tell that story just too many times if you think you're getting senile stuff but anyway uh so anyway so yeah but anyway so think about that i think about a soldier brother brian here i guess was a real soldier for many years right amen and so he knows what it's like to be to be a soldier but there's supposed to be you know supposed to be something attractive i guess about a soldier to a girl or whatever girl likes older because they're supposed to be big bad brave and all of that right but there's a certain pride no doubt that goes with being a soldier and that right if you ever see any soldiers pictures you don't have the head tongue down and they're they're back as far as they can they're soldiers right you know they're soldiers they're proud they're they're military they're they're bad so to speak you know and supposed to be smart and all of that and so but there's something about it there's something about a war there's something about fighting there's something about victory right and that is in that it's em embedded into human beings right well as us as human beings because we certainly have had our share of wars we've had our share of battles we've had our share of people who actually wanted to conquer the world right who wanted to be mighty conquerors who who had great military mics and so forth amen and so they would go out and they would conquer and and so forth we know that's what the devil is out to do the devil is a conqueror he's a fighter he knows what battle is all about right and what war is all about how many knows that truly we are in a war how many of those years of war come on folks don't just say you know sometimes we like to make it well you know no but it's actually you are in about you are in a war my friend we are in a whoa a all-out full-out war and it seems the left seems to be doing better than the right right now in this world the bad side's winning huh for the most part in this world they're winning they're getting the upper hand hey those who make things worse they're winning they're making it worse yet every day they go about making it worse amen and they they thrive on how many knows and and i think i've seen in the news the other day is somebody in the in canada that was that was arrested he says you know you don't you you can't under uh what is it could take for granted your freedoms you don't realize what that people and then the devil wants to take your freedoms you know once you end up in jail you're like waking up hey boy i didn't think you could be that you know but how many knows that there's some somebody arrested because they didn't have a cover shot or something like that just go crazy stuff going on but no so listen what i'm trying to say is listen they were in a battle we're in a real battle real warrior and that's why they even uh the the songwriter was inspired to write that song about onward christian soldiers marching as who are right how many knows we are soldiers even brother brahmin the greatest battle ever fought talked about how that god is equipping god is training help me out this morning soldiers he's getting soldiers ready to fight this final battle how many has to fight really hard against a great big old mean ugly guy goliath that's called lukewarmness that's right if he can't get to no other way he'll get you to just relax they'll get you right there just put your armor down a little bit don't pray like you should don't read your bible like you should don't be sincere like you should just let down a little bit and ain't long and you ain't even in the pew anymore yeah i need to be the church if i don't they don't take much folks you're in a battle whether you know it or not the devil wants you to be he don't want you to be hot or cold he wants you to be lukewarm just somewhere in between sure we all battle it because we're living in that age amen so we are in a battle for sure we are so now let's look at this because as we think about looking at the lord looking at god i mean that's a really good way real good direction to look the bible says one place look unto me ye ends of the earth and be saved if you're ever going to get saved you're going to have to look to him because he's the savior all right let's talk a little bit about this maybe wednesday i'll take some scriptures a lot of scriptures of the different things that god said he is because we want to lay out first of all perhaps a layout of all the things that god is and then take go through the scriptures and look at how that god manifested himself in those things that he said that he was brother bannon makes it this says it this way christ the mystery of god revealed amen because let me see here uh if i can find it here this would be in ephesians paul talking paul talking about i believe it was about the great mystery of god galatians i think it may be in galatians give me a second would you we're going to take our time talking about the mystery of god how many knows that god has had a mystery it's been a mystery ever since the beginning of time amen but in chapter one of ephesians he says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ jesus according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by christ jesus himself according to the good pleasure of his own will to the praise of his glory of his grace where he never made us accepted in him beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace and have a bound that towered us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will amen folks in this hour we know that we understand what it's really all about better than anybody ever better than anybody ever has we understand what was in god's mind now brother baum says now god's secret mystery that he had before the world began back in the back part of god's mind amen well oh that the world would hear this this morning we're going to talk about what god had it is the back part in the deepest part of his mind before he made the first stardust actually before he even formed angels to worship him i remember my mom's mom his preacher never preached this to me brother john he never told me that god at one time wasn't god he was the self-existing one right he's just self-existing god means an object of worship and if something makes worship and yeah you ain't no god oh wow whoa that's deep for somebody right they thought what do you mean he wasn't god i knew anybody that would have never heard that before would have been critical to that statement what do you mean he would not only because god means an object of worship he was self-existing one don't mean that god didn't exist he existed but he didn't have anything to worship him amen and so oh i like it you know oh my when you think about god it's just it's just so awesome it just makes makes me smile just to think about him to think that there's absolutely no imperfections in god one of the things i wrote down here and is that god you know in this in this with god god has never ever been defeated right he's too perfect for that all it would take is for god to be defeated one time right just one time and he wouldn't really be god he'd be imperfect imperfect imperfect now with us human beings we're far from perfect something else i thought about in studying this as we begin to look at god it brought me to the thought that our prophet taught us he says that you do not look at yourself when you fail and how terrible you are we as human beings are pathetic we're the biggest bunch of failures you ever saw how many knows you was born a failure i say that because the bible says you were born in sin shaped into thick but he come into this world speaking lies the first chance you got you lied the first chance you got you stole that cookie huh yeah it was in your nature born of failure and folks i've been a christian for for for i don't know can't even remember about 30 40 years maybe and when i think about even my christian life and the failures in my christian life it's depressing [Music] of how many times i've failed oh i know there's people just think they're perfect and never fail but you ain't got the holy ghost like you should because the holy ghost will show you where you're not perfect if you ain't got the holy ghost you're perfect and everybody else is terrible ah look at that one look at this one you're always looking at everybody else's bad places but if you got the holy ghost she'll make you look at your own places hello that's why the prophet said even as a christian if you fail if you would just continuously harbor that failure think of how depressed you would be [Music] but you don't look at that what do we look to calvary we look to him why because he is perfect he never made the first mistake he never lost one battle the disciples lost the battle his children loses battles people that he uses loses battles huh sure they lose battles samson lost the battle david lost the battle peter had the very faith of god now the prophet teaches us that the faith is never defeated it cannot be defeated isn't that right faith can't but they ain't talking about you peter had faith oh he had that faith but guess what he got away from faith when he began to look at circumstances faith began to leave him and he began to sink huh wouldn't it be something since the chinese if the story was jesus walked on the water and he ended up having to swim because he lost faith he swam the rest away to the boat i don't want to hear no i mean he was imperfect that he lost faith lose a drop of faith that water was just as hard at the beginning of the shore as it was when he got to the boat that water was hard well whatever it was but he walked on it right maybe he was floating i don't know but i'll tell you what his faith aren't you glad for a savior oh what a savior oh what a savior is mine praise be to god us human beings we're grateful for why because when we do some but when we do fall that there is a there is a mediator somebody we can look to and say god pick me back up don't don't everybody go running around right now but aren't you glad that he let you get back up aren't you glad that when he forgives you because of your laxation on us and everything else and all the failures that you are he allows you to be forgiven again and clean in your heart have joy like i said just hold your peace don't get too happy but i'm happy for the grace of almighty god a lot of us probably wouldn't have come to church this morning if you looked at your failure well i failed today i don't deserve forgiveness i don't i don't we don't we don't the devil wanna the devil wants to tell you you don't deserve it that's why a lot of them a lot of them take a gun to their head yeah you deserve it amen so we think about that that's right way back way way way back before there was before he created any kind of uh voice for us to speak with before he made my hand before he made the earth before there was any stars there was god there was a self-existing one first thing he made from what we understand and he said he created angels right created angels the bible says that they don't rest day and night but they're going holy holy holy holy holy they don't get tired [Music] how many is looking forward to maybe being able to hear these angels getting in the presence of these angels amen here holy holy holy unto the lord then he was a god huh he created a lot of angels amen put them a foot to put them on three moral agency put them on freeman agency and of course you know one of them got jealous because he wanted to be a god too lucifer the devil right he got jealous he wanted to be like the most high he wanted to sit on the mound of the congregation be like the most high be above the sires of the arms that's right oh my but anyway let's go back so there he was there god was before anything was made before he was even god and what we're going to talk about is god's attributes or we could put it into a little planer words perhaps is we want to talk about what god is it's what he is amen who he is what he is amen no not notice here now it was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed huh praise the lord to express himself because first there wasn't even a moon a star at a molecule or anything he was god but he wasn't exactly god at the time because he was god is an object of worship there was nothing to worship so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed amen now while we've got god way before there was ever a stardust before there was a star a moon or angel or any thing remember this that everything that god was he is right now amen how many remembers the prophet of god making a statement that god likes to take and show his children his muscles y'all remember him making that statement it's like a dad and he'll show him his muscles say here look at this son huh you know i've i thought about that and i thought i thought where's the scripture for such a thing where's the scripture for god showing off his muscles all right now found one would you like it for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might show my power in thee amen in other words he raised him up he says i raised you up i made you a great kingdom but i knew what kind of a heart you have i know what kind of a guy you are so i know you're as stubborn as a mule so since you're that way already and i've done everything under the book that that is to be done and you've enslaved my people for all this time whatever i do to you i'm justified so i'm gonna harden your heart and even though you might want to let him go i'm not going to let you because i'm going to change your mind about it i don't hear one amen but that's the gospel truth the bible says that he hardens pharaoh's heart is that right so that he would not let him go and then i'm gonna whoop you for don't think there's injustice with god if you do that you better go back to your prayer bones he had already done enough to be destroyed completely just like he did on the red sea because of what he done there's no injustice of god amen but notice that i thought about that that's that's one place and another in the old testament i seen it this morning oh wow right there it is for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan be from before you until you were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were all on over that all the people of the earth might know that the hand of god the lord that it is mighty how many believes this morning god has a mighty heart other places he says strong is the lord that delivereth thee the hand of the lord that delivereth thee praise be to god you know because i don't believe in just talking about a god of history but a god of today amen what we could get into this morning of what god did to brother branham's ministry the battles that he fought the warrior that he was the things that he did amen that got through did that god did in our generation and then hopefully every one of us has a testimony in our own heart of what god has done in your life because brother bran's fine that's all we believe all that but what is god doing in your life do you know him as some of these attributes that he is that's a good question amen so i thought about this that's right don't look at yourself you get depressed but look at him look at him how many knows that if you allow yourself to live you'll really be depressed but any good that is in you how many knows it's not you but it's him praise be to god it's him in you that's the only thing that we have to brag about we as human beings we have nothing nothing i want to want to say little because we sure like to brag about what we can do we would like to brag about what we did even preachers oh but we had a we had 2 000 people there last night huh we had a bigger crowd than them people over there did you selfish ornery little thing huh that's right even we can get to where our human side is in it's very easy it can happen real easy how many believes that we've got to have a lot of grace for us each other you're gonna have a lot of grace for me i gotta have a lot of grace for you otherwise the sparks are gonna fly upwards because we are far from perfect but we are working on the lord have his way with us so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was i like this first word love right in him was to be father amen like wednesday night alba father he wants that to be a daddy he wanted to have children amen another subject and him was to be his son and he was to be savior in him was to be healer and him was to be a deliverer and he was to be a mighty warrior oh my mighty in battle undefeated and disputed champion of the world how many is with me how many will root this champion on this morning say that's what i believe god is that's what i believe jesus is he is the undisputed undefeated champion of the world goliath wasn't the champion giant great big old goliath looked big but little david was bigger than the giant because somebody was in him a story i didn't tell you last sunday with the sermon that i was preaching and that is he that is in you i just thought about this story myself but it's like a little girl going down through the real bad part of town where it's a bunch of big old gangsters let's just say chicago because i would i don't know about you but i wouldn't even want to drive through that place would you not one weekend 64 wounded 10 dead folks you'd have to be on guard wouldn't you but going through the worst part of town some little girl goes down there and a whole bunch of gang members come out there with their machetes and their guns perhaps they say you can't go down this street this is our street she says get out of the way huh what do you think about that think she'd have a chance no but guess what if there was about 15 big old striping bodybuilders all right and they had strapped on them 50 cal machine guns that's you know just automatic she'd say i said for the last time get out about i'd imagine somebody would move don't you why because it's not who she is but who's with her how many believes that this morning it's not who you are but it's who's with you on the way to church i thought of one of the sweetest scriptures that i could think of and it's found in romans 8 amen the bible says therefore if god be with us who can be or for us who can be against us that is one wonderful scripture are you with me this morning just calm down now [Music] that all excites you question is he is he is he with you [Music] if he's not with you you can stay depressed you really ought to be depressed because it's depressing without him [Music] life is a plan my it is uh well i don't know how to describe it but it's a bland taste just to jerry taste something just terrible tasting that's what life is without christ no salt how many please we're the salt of the earth but the salt has to make contact oh my think about it so brother bam says so the first thing in my opinion is he made angels and so forth he went on down son there wasn't the sun the moon was this that or the other and as he asked job job where was you when i laid the foundations of the world when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy jesus heard that scream right there before the foundation of the world he knew that the sons of god were for god he's seen it in his mind he thought it in his mind before the first stylus was ever been where was you you was in the back part of my mind do you realize that whenever job was in the in the lowest part of his life in the pit of despair that that's what god said said job uh give up your loins like a man i got something to say to you where were you when i laid the foundation lord sons of god shouted for joy answer me today we've got the answer he was in his thinking before the foundation of the world you was a part of him why didn't they shout because that mighty warrior was going to come down and he was going to defeat every devil there is he was going to become our messiah he was going to be our savior our deliverer amen oh my that's why we're so happy you would never have experienced him as a savior unless you was lost never as a deliverer unless she was in the pit somewhere there in my despair i cried so loved but he didn't hit me his but yet his hand reached further down then i could reach up it means everything to you praise be to god that's right 18 19 years old amen i didn't know which way to go what to do but there was something in my heart there's got to be a god out there somewhere god help me and he reached out and picked me up he brought me out of the miry clay i know him as savior i know him as messiah he is my savior oh what a savior oh what a savior somebody said oh what a savior is mine wonderful glorious isn't he he's wonderful he's glorious what a savior is mine boy if we could all repent of one thing this morning it is that this isn't real enough to it this just isn't real enough to me my senses to the reality of the savior and what god really is isn't real enough to me the appreciation of what he has done in my life and how he has delivered me from the hands how did he set the captain free this mighty warrior come and he set the captive free amen aren't you glad brother bad knows but it's hard to get free up here you've got to just kind of let go and let god have his way say lord come and you know folks i was just going to have a good teaching lesson this morning here i am screaming hollering just getting happy i'm sorry about that if you don't like that but not really sorry about it sorry if you don't like it they don't i'm having a good time maybe like brother bam said to that girl man you don't drink you don't smoke what do you do for a good time i go to church to have a good time all you depressed people out there why don't you have a good time sometimes come on to church how many believe that that's right that's a place where we can come into heaven like there ain't no telling books ain't no telling what might happen we've got to deliver our heritage but he's still the same as he ever was do you can you imagine what churches is gonna be like when the holy spirit leaves well now we are gathered here this morning once again look on the chandeliers and there's icebergs hanging down it's cold stiff people took put too much starch in their shirt i mean lives and they've come all stiff you can't move the lips hardly it's so cold huh no amens no hallelujah no praise hallelujah that's what happened when the holy ghost goes you become cold and formal and indifferent i thank god that he's still here god is still here god is still god he's still in the saving business all right [Music] so we find out that that's where we was he knew every one of you that would make it to church this morning he knew where you would choose to sit huh now a lot of us have kind of our spots right amen but god knew all of this he knew why that he would lay this on my heart maybe somebody needs it right lay this on my heart to talk about him to pray on him to talk about who he not just was but is and is to come you know what he said he was i'm he which was and is and is to come he's everything and let me think about him the great mighty warrior moyer a warrior that comes and fights a battle to deliver you because you're a captive right that's what his purpose is to come and take you away from the clutches of the pawn shop of the devil to bring you to true freedom oh my what did what say about freedom he says americans think they're free he says steering more bondage into communists because what did he say he says freedom is not about having the freedom out here in the flesh real freedom is being free in here this is true freedom amen so let's look at christ for just a minute let's go on down now move into christ's life and talk about how perfect he is now that he was never defeated amen he is a warrior that's mighty in battle in the old testament we know that almighty god come down in moses right and he'd just take a stick and it wasn't moses or the stick it was god when he set out to deliver to israelites they got deliberate amen many times god was perfect when he challenged the devil in a duel with his servant job and that right god won superiorly there amen because why job held his integrity amen what about the apostle paul amen paul had shipwrecks he had beatings he had all kinds of obstacles he had all kinds of things but he was never defeated because even in death he said we are more than conquerors through him that love us like brother ben said we're not just survivors we're victorious bible says we're more than just conquerors through him that loved us amen praise be to god i've heard this by different ministers and i'm going to say it again i think it's good born a conqueror is it's like muhammad ali i want to use well i hate to use him because he went away from christianity to the buddha or one of those others muhammad or whatever i don't like anybody that leaves christianity and goes some other religion huh but he would go out there and fight that fight come on home and hand that check to his wife thank you honey huh she was more than a conqueror she didn't have to be in it she just received it enjoyed it how many knows that's what jesus did for you and me he fought the battle he cried and yosemite tear drops of blood amen and just i was a terrible paddle the greatest battle he fought was in the garden of gethsemane over his own will how many knows the great this battle your fight is in your own mind over your own will that's the hardest guy to conquer is yourself that's your greatest battle well this morning last brother bam said many times let go and let god out of his way [Music] how many bleeds was sitting in the infused every one of us could loosen up a little that's right we could all just kind of not be so comfortable because it's so easy to be comfortable huh i was told that some preachers in the past had his congregation sit on rocks didn't want him to be comfortable too much why we'd be up and friends be to god that prayer you know i can't sit there no more stand up worst of the lord not to be too comfortable amen but thank god for the comfortable seats but just enter in what i'm trying to say is how many believe we could enter in a little more yeah i know i could lord help us amen so how many knows in this life it's either lose or win there's not really any draws you either lose your battles or you win your battles you're either victorious or you're defeated amen and jesus was never defeated i guess one of the first place that we find that jesus fighting because we know that he uh came up the legion there's a whole legion of them right 2000 or something brother brad talked about him a couple weeks ago but it's a bunch of devils right and he defeated every one of them they went out into the swine can i put you a little question mark in your mind this morning i don't know that those devils wanted to go into the swine to die but the pigs probably got so miserable with on them they went ahead and killed themselves i would rather be dead in the ocean than to have this thing on me huh there were wicked devils and jesus cast them out no matter what jesus came up against he was always victorious how many knows he came up to the devil himself came up to the devil himself no doubt he had met him back because jesus was before i come from god and i go back to god before abraham was i am right so now that is jesus back there with job making that challenge and so forth so when the devil come to him on the mountain there begin to tell him and try to tempt him to make bread trump off the pinnacle of the building and so forth all these temptations that he attempted him with he was victorious in every one of them it don't matter if there was blindness he opened up the blind right the death could hear like i said peter and them didn't have the faith that they needed because in faith real genuine faith of god knows no defeat it's not defeated people have an intellectual and everything else the reason i say that is because i know that peter and them had faith to do a lot of miracles right but it came to the epileptic child remember they didn't couldn't cast him out and they said why couldn't we do it what did jesus say because of the lack of your faith because of your faith that's what he said because if you had a faith the greater must receive right if you'd had the right kind of faith it would have happened how many believes that applies to every one of us if you're going to be completely victorious you have to have the right kind of faith but jesus he went there and he wasn't defeated no he wasn't defeated he threw that devil out he healed that person and of course you know they foamed at the mouth to think and throw themselves the dead and they thought he was dead he had been so bad but after that he raised up and was normal amen how about death now before even jesus died and rose again jesus conquered death long before he died how many knows how he did it how did jesus conquer death before he died lazarus is the answer lazarus was dead right and jesus spoke and conquered death right there come forth and came forth that's conquering death amen that's right so even death could not stand in the way of christ why do you think over in revelations he told john fear not i am he which liveth and was dead and am alive forevermore why because he conquered he conquered himself at the at the garden of gethsemane and then he went to the cross you say well to the world it looked like a defeat didn't it the disciples let me tell you something the disciples every last one of the disciples were in the pit of despair they were in the bottom of of depression how many knows that people are so depressed i'm going get this i'm going fishing and when people try to tell them hey he's alive he wouldn't even believe him right mary he tried to tell him he's alive no i don't believe it thomas he was a real doubter i will say this about thomas thomas may have been a daughter but he knew who god was he had the godhead right he had the godhead right when he touched his hands he fell down what did he say my lord and my god a lot of people ain't got that right amen wouldn't even believe it peter and them oh my how depressed they were because of what looked like everything had fallen apart my my god has to bring us to those places a lot of us have been to those places to where boy it really couldn't get any worse oh yeah brother branham was there too couldn't get any worse when his wife died and he was begging for his little daughter sharon rose begging for her little baby forgot not to take her and that black sheep come in front of him god would not hear his prayer amen but you know what the glorious part about it was oh my when did when when that other doctor i'm not sure what his name was but the doctor the friend of his asked him he says you know he says did you hold your religion did you keep your religion during all this hard time is that a good question we gotta ask ourselves during that really really really low time what what happened and he says no but it kept me because how many knows if it had been brother branham he probably spoke against it but there was something in there that kept him from saying it there's something in there said well the lord gave the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord i believe every son of god brother baby talked about every child of god that comes to god so get ready folks if you're a child of god son of god sooner or later sometime in your life no doubt god is going to take you to the very bottom of the bottom and that's where we'll find what you're made out of we'll find out if it's you or if it's him in you amen the difference will be if he's in you you'll be all right you'll make it you'll come up out of there because he is the one that triumphs he's the mighty conqueror amen aren't you glad that you have we have a perfect one folks you can look at each other we can look at the prophet of god and you can say that's not perfect folks i don't know about you but after i lost my wife after i lost my baby because i disobeyed god how many knows he disobeyed again in africa and he went up when he got when god said don't go up he's stealing up to another area a guy had told none he went back home and he was sick for years he was sick for years because of it paid dearly second time around that's right but the good part about this prophetic god is if he was fallible he was full of failures but he would confess it and he would admit it so that we could learn from it and not do it whether it was a simple thing of of lying on the telephone right simple things like that he exposed he said yeah that's right so why we you know there's the christ in him we follow we follow that amen but we don't follow his failures we learn from his failures that's the way it is with any leader and when you follow the christ in him not the failures in him amen because that's the same way with our children what if our children looked on us seeing our failures and they follow our failures it wouldn't be good would it no let the children if you see faults in your parents be patient pray for them but follow the good amen all right i love that conquered legions of demons and so forth epilepsy blindness and so forth because you know what how many know that death is the biggest enemy what bigger devil what bigger enemy are you going to fight than death itself healing that's smaller hey you might have a cancer that might eat you up in six months but you know go to church get prayed for it goes away you're fine but it's not as big as being dead because i don't know about you but most of the time i kind of look at it long and still alive they're so but i shouldn't look at it like that there's hope after today if you can believe amen oh my i know what we're all thinking but that's kind of hard to believe but it's the truth anyway so what did we do we looked at what the prophet and how he said it how he went to calvary and how that they thought that he was a a defeat when he went to calgary and when he got killed how many knows that was the farthest thing from defeat it would have been complete defeat if he wouldn't have went are you with me because the devil wanted anything but for him to pay the price he wanted to give him the kingdom without him paying for it then he still had rights on it but if he pays the price for it he owns it i mean that's why abraham would not take that uh graveyard that he bought for free they wanted to just give it to him but he says i'm paying you for it i'm gonna own it i want to own it that's the way the lord is he paid for our price that way he can own you we are bought with the price you are not your own whoa how many sled for that you are not your own boss you can't do what you want you have a master that you serve we have a heavenly father we have a warrior that we follow we have a captain that we follow amen it was the greatest victory of all time the battle was don't you know that i could call so many legions of angels 10 legions i guess for so many legions of angels right now that could change the whole thing but i've got to overcome that i've got to overcome not my will but then be done if it be possible let this cup pass from me you talk about coming down to the door of death and then having been a struggle with the lord that's right you're gonna have to go through this he's gonna have to be beat unrecognizable he's going to have to suffer like nobody suffered he's going to have to be forsaken by everybody who stayed with him anybody stay with him no no no his church left him his entire church left him he was all by himself having to go face death by himself peter hiding back out there somewhere warming himself by a fire trying to get a little something to eat because he had done you know betrayed him amen said i don't know i don't know and lied three times he did know him there he was by himself but he went up there suffered oh my i like i like what jesus said the pilot i believe it was don't you realize i have the power to release you and jesus says you wouldn't have any power zero power if daddy wouldn't have given it to you the father hadn't given it to you you'd have no power and what did jesus say no man taketh my life i give it he gave it freely who did he give it for the ones that he knew would want it he says only to redeemed or even consid considered in redemption right only the predestination even considered those who before knew would want it the others would never want in the first place he didn't die for them he knew they wouldn't want it but he died because of the people he knew would want it that's why if you raise your hand you can say thank you lord jesus i want it i need a savior i need a warrior that will fight every devil fight himself fight his own will and then go to the cross and give his life a ransom for many the bible says oh that was a mighty war a mightiest warrior ever how many members the story of napoleon and jesus 33 years old died right he went down there let me finish this story we'll pick up the podium in a minute but think about that he went up there and he oh my the pain during all of the pain every stripe everything was put on there amen and i don't imagine that they had to grab jesus's hand and pull it out he probably laid it over there where do you want it right there right there laid it freely stretched out his hand as they put the nails in his hand and as they took and put that big old piece of steel put his one foot over top of the other one something like that and drove it through both of them right down and man took that sledgehammer and drove it down into that wood it wasn't coming off uh same way with the hands no doubt had a big uh big head on it put it on there stay drove it to him sister chinese he was thinking about you thinking about you thinking about each and every one of us amen as they nailed him there who was he thinking about you and me that would need victory that would need him to fight our battles for us in this age and this time martin luther john wesley all the brother brand of all of them that they're all gone now now the battle's with you and me now we need him as a warrior we need him as a deliverer as a messiah amen a savior the savior from this world a savior from this layout at cih a savior from this lukewarmness this depressing age amen can i have another 10 minutes i'm going to go 10 minutes because i want to tell you about this savior messiah because that's what a savior is a savior is somebody that is like a deliverer saves people amen we know that i had it in my and i had pulled it up just the meaning of it but it talks about like the jews were looking to be for him to be their savior to save him you know from so forth but you know in the christian world it says that they believed him to be the savior this messiah is the savior of mankind of all mankind to deliver us the mighty warrior amen so every pain he put it in there and then it got so bad it hurt so bad being rejected by all of mankind can you imagine the very god that made all of mankind there's only one perhaps one or so that stood with him that was mary going along and saying what has he done what has he done what has he done but good why are you doing this huh mama wasn't ashamed of him mama followed him along but just maybe her that's it and he says he died of a broken heart died of a broken heart and they were coming over there to break his legs they looked he was dead already he says well let's not do that because the bible says not one bone of him will be broken they could i'll tell you what they could have swung that thing as hard as they wanted to that angel's hand would have been there it'd never hit i mean believe that because i'm here to tell you we have angels watching over us but they said that he's already dead and so they just took a spear and put it up in his side right up under his rib cage somewhere in here probably liver area and somewhere in there water and blood gushed out how many believes that that when that water and that blood gushed out it went down on the earth in the dirt and he prayed the price to redeem this very planet this planet became his immediately bought it he bought in me he purchased our salvation on calvary straight the greatest warrior ever when he came up to the scribes and the pharisees these intellectual giants when he came up against them they try to catch him in his word like uh with the woman that was caught in the very act hey the law says do it well he's gonna have to be real smart now because the law says do it right but they were messing with the fountain of wisdom the very one that formed the alphabet he knew exactly what to write on the sand he knew exactly how to bend down and write what to say he knew exactly the words to say when he says he that is without sin cast the first stone i don't know about you but i know what it's like to have conviction come over you sometimes conviction will come over you in the congregation man you just want to run to the altar and say god that's right that's right that's me and all i know about that folks i believe there was such conviction on all of them they seen all the sins they had ever done is this boy i sure ain't worried i can no way i can i can throw a stone amen conquered everything went down gave up the ghost right the holy spirit left he left him and he died his spirit left and where did it go down the hill down to the regions of the lost the bible says that he preached to the souls that were in prison he come down there and preached to noah's group the andeluvian people right all those over there that didn't believe and he says i am he that was to come here i am can you imagine can you imagine how they feel down there right now knowing that yeah he did it was true it was true and he's going to come back there's going to be a judgment not going to be damned huh that has to make that region even worse right now for all of them but that's the prophet of god he says he come down there and down there was the devil the regions of hades he comes walking down through there [Music] blood still wet on calvary and as the prophet put it he says ah you finally here you finally got down here i finally got you i'm not here for the reason you think shoved him up against the wall threw him up against the wall he got a hold of his neck so to speak reach down beside his side and rip them keys off of his side says you ain't gonna have no more power you ain't gonna scare my people no more amen my people are gonna be like pauses i'm more glad to die oh that's where his ice thing oh great where is your victory you ain't going to be the spook anymore i have the keys of your house now i'll unlock what i want to unlock and i'll lock what i want to lock the bible says he took the keys of hell and of death amen homie knows what that is death means total separation from god he took the keys of being separated from god away from the devil now you and i don't have to be separated from god anymore i mean does he give peter to jesus unlike the unlock the kingdom of heaven amen the folks can come on in amen and hell the grave huh to go and to be separated from god to have death in hell amen he took the keys of both of them you ain't got to worry about going to hell anymore why because he said got the keys to him amen and on the third day tick tock tick tock tick tock in three days destroy the temple and in three days my father will raise it up again is that right destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up again hello all right i'm glad he did i'm just glad that he came at his picture taken with his prophet in this generation right here a pillar of fire he's alive he truly is resurrected oh my think about that rose up and then he went to paradise with the keys and he unlocked wherever they were i don't understand just where it was but it was a place where it was called paradise abraham and isaac and all that were saved they were kind of locked in a certain place can't go on higher and he took them up into a higher place let them all come out some of them were seen in the streets isn't that right and within that three days within three days one of those times the clock tick tock tick tock tick tock huh it was ticking he was talking as mary was walking towards the sepulcher to bring flowers and spices and to see the place where he had been laid to go visit the grave but by the time she got there time was up he come up back up got a glorified body his body become glorified is that right someday the bible says we're going to have a body like unto his own glorious body these body that's why i believe in resurrection i believe those bodies change i don't believe that the third has to fly anywhere i believe they could go right through the dirt huh because brother bam says not like you're going to be thinking that it is a bunch of graves being open huh don't need all that why because he walked through walls go right through stuff but it'll be glorified he was rose and mary came there and formulated where is he amen and jesus made himself known to her is that right and she ran said he has triumphant the bible says that he went up far above all power above all principalities amen above all authority what do you think about churches that have to close pretty much permanently in other countries under the name of covet kind of scary isn't it don't you know that's what they'd like just shut down until it's all over with how many years will that be who do we obey huh because it's coming fast to the place to where you either have to be a god or man huh but he rose and he was triumphant over death hell and the grave and as the song says oh behold the mighty conquer behold him in plain view for he is the mighty conqueror since he what he rent the veil in two amen brother bam tells us about great soldiers great warriors people like and he talked about hitler even that was supposed to be a messiah to the german people japan wants a messiah he says the church is one of messiah they want a superman somebody that can you know way out to everybody else napoleon he was a great warrior took all the known world by the time he was 33 when he was 17 he believed in prohibition no drinking and all of that by the time he was done conquering everything else he says he was a drunk and had 1600 harlots following his army not much of a man and he met his water low not defeated because he didn't do it right amen and died drunk what a terrible way to go at 33 but jesus christ at 33 conquered death hell and the grave for you and me come up a mighty conqueror i just have to take a little bit more times okay it's a beautiful day it's sunday amen and let's just take our time one time in arlington texas he says they come up there and i've got it in my noise in my little textbook events i'll just read it all the fbi was gonna was there to expose me this is a battle that jesus fought in our age like i said i'd love to have maybe take some time to read some more of it that it was a devil this ministry and i was a devil the ministers a bunch of them up there somewhere above uh houston there put out a big bunch of tracks and passed them all around like over the auditorium and said that i was simon the sorcerer casting out devils like simon and the archer witchcraft so that night there had been a couple girls that had been healed the night before there and they told of them crying and everything and said they said that they was going home they was afraid said the fbi picked up brother branham this girl was put in the right mind when you she saw that vision over her and he said that and she said i did it maybe i caused all this trouble i said oh you're scared i said you've seen god the healer and i said now watch him as a warrior aren't you glad that he fights your battles for you watch him in battle see how great he is see how great god is as a warrior in battle that night i walked out and i said everybody in this here uh that's in my campaign mr baxter my brother the two young ladies that was healed the minister said today that you was included in them i want you to go out of the building and they went out of the building and i said now i've got a piece of paper here which the custodian of the auditorium went out and got up all thousands of them off of the cars hired to mexican kids to get them in and i said and i've got a little bill here that says tonight that i'm the simon the sorcerer and going to be exposed by the fbi here tonight and i said all right fbi i am on the platform in the name of the lord jesus christ come to the platform now and expose me i says if i'm doing anything outside of god's almighty bible come here and expose me and i says where are you at thousands sitting there and everybody was crying and i said waiting i'm waiting for the fbi according to your paper here you was going to expose me tonight just then i waited a few minutes and i felt that spirit coming around and i said it wasn't the fbi i'm no criminal i said every time an fbi agent come in my meeting they got saved even their chief got saved in my meeting captain alvarez and that's oh i said no no fbi does anything like that and i said what it is it's two backslidden preachers i looked hanging out there and there was a great big black thing hanging over the audience nice to see music move right up like this to the secondary battle balcony and i said right there said uh one with a light suit on one with a gray suit on they get then they got down like that ducking down and i says don't get down i thought you was going to expose me look like everybody looked like somebody else and i says a couple of back you're a couple of backslidden preachers you got nothing to do with it and i says now if i am simon the sorcerer casting out devils from witchcraft as you say i am and you're you're holy and righteous in god come down to the platform and if i'm the simon the sorcerer i will fall dead and if you're if you're the one that's wrong you'll fall dead see the warrior folks don't play bring the sword you want to cut we'll cut you'll fall dead come on down now we'll see who's right how many knows that's exactly what would have happened because the aim of the lord remember the angel of the lord never left brother branham whether he was in his hotel or wherever the angel lord was like joshua the first chapter he says i will be with you and no man shall ever stand before thee i mean that's the way it was with the prophet it didn't matter if it's witchcraft over in germany where they had the tent blowing away and they were bringing all kinds of witchcraft he in the name of the lord stopped it all hundreds of times in places where the witches and the different ones would try to withstand god but he defeated him every time 70 ministers in chicago tried to withstand god in this generation and there was a trap blade for him isn't that right said they were going to question him on the godhead water baptism and serpent seed and brother ram says to the front of his he says you're not going to have the room that you have now you know i know what's going on and there's going to be a certain person a certain lady sitting over here with certain clothes on this side of the other and then that time it happened just exactly like that and that man came up and said now y'all can question brother random if you want to but he told me that person was going to be there he told me we wouldn't have another room this out of the other and they knew god was with him and then brother ben says come on up come stand by my side because the angel had told him to go down there i'll be by your side is what the angel told the law but told brother adam you know what would happen if you come into the angel spot it ain't gonna be a good thing amen that was another mighty battle isn't that right but anyway so to finish this story oh my let's see who's who that's right if i be falsely again god you'll show it falsely if i'm right god will always testify to the right amen now listen you are uh you know and then i said now listen come on down he said and we'll see who's right that's right put them to a challenge they kept their head down i said don't duck your head i like that don't be ducking your head back up there they were trying to hide all right like that and i said now people you see who's in the right and who's in the wrong they were scared and they went out over the top over there just as hard as they could and i said oh i see they're leaving perhaps they're coming on down here they went out of the building just as hard as they could down the steps i stood there and i waited i said now we'll just see let them come to the platform let god show who's who that's right and i said if i be falsely then gods will show it falsely that's right and god will always testify to the right i don't guess i tagged the next one but brother branham said something about uh how did well let me just read this i had a great victory a great wonderful service like it was in houston when the baptist preacher said that i was a demon and so forth remember the houston colosseum and and that's the only picture that came out and so forth you see what took place there when the angel of the lord come down now you know what happened we've never seen no more of them i guess he's still talking about them this is that night the lord throw the victory that there that's still talked about in arlington see i am the lord has planted it i'll water it day and night at least any man should come and pluck it from my hands heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away i'm really pleased god will never be defeated folks my my mind when we think about that lord help us how many jesus needs more of him lord i just need more of you i want the reality of every everything that you are i want you to be a real reality in our hearts let's stand musicians if you'll come morning will y'all pray for me as i continue on this and just see what the lord will give us and feed us and just to talk about jesus amen with our heads bowed this morning once again lord jesus we come before you this morning so grateful god that you went lord jesus and you paid the price you fought through every barricade you fought every devil every temptation every snare that the devil tried to put in front of you but lord you went all the way lord to death you conquered death hell in the grave lord so that we could have once again be in fellowship with you lord you've got the keys of hell and death and we don't have to be scared of death anymore we don't have to fear anything lord jesus fear not you told us we don't have to be scared of anything not even death itself so many of your children down through the ages it would have looked like defeat when they gave their lives when they were fed to lions but it was not a defeat it was victory because they went into the presence of god where it's a hundred million times better than this world ever is lord we come before you this morning lord needing some of that great warrior to come to deliver us lord from lukewarmness to deliver us from all of the temptations and the snares of the devil that he slays the traps for us we ask this morning lord jesus as we raise our hands say lord make i want you to be a greater reality in my life lord jesus i want to truly appreciate who you are and what you are in me lord that holy spirit father help me god lord to cherish it to nourish it lord never to grieve it away from my heart
