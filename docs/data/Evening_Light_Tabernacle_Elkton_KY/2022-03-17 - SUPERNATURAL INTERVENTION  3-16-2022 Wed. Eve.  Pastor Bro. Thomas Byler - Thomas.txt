and all we have to do is render our lives to him and we can bear in the reward that he took for that cross all the pain and suffering it's just been on my mind this week it's almost unfathomable that he could come down he could take all the blame all the punishment and all we get is the reward and all we all he asked us is that we lay our life down for him amen i'm gonna ask that brother byler

his first song leading right amen give him a hand thank you thank the lord amen praise the lord god is good isn't he amen i'm gonna take my coat off it's summertime amen praise the lord it's good to be now so lord amen god bless you i trust you're having a good week amen and everything's going good for you amen so praise the lord let's just bow our heads go before the lord in prayer kind heavenly father we come before you once again lord jesus assembling ourselves together according to your word lord jesus knowing father that lord it is what you have ordained and jesus has promised that wherever two or three are gathered there you would be in our midst lord we just thank you father for your many blessings to us lord we just ask god you just continue to bless those that are not here and can't be here lord jesus we just ask your blessing upon them and lord jesus thank you for all that you do for us we ask you blessing upon the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid upon our heart minister tonight we ask god that you would just help me to speak the things that you once said lord come down in a special way with your presence lord anoint lord jesus may we all go from here closer to you than what we was when we came we ask these blessings and favors in the name of jesus christ amen and amen let's turn our bibles to the book of joshua if you will once again out of the book of joshua amen it seems like we have been in joshua quite a bit but amen this is uh i mean just going to be a little bit different direction perhaps but it's certainly something i have enjoyed just meditating on i mean you know what as a preacher i'll tell you what we can get pretty happy just meditating on the lord you know meditation is a good thing how many knows that i think david said meditate on a day and night right and on his law does he meditate day and night and the things that you meditate is what creates the atmosphere around you amen it's just it's a wonderful thing so in joshua the first chapter and i want to read one verse there and then i think we'll go to hebrews 5 13 5 and 6. all right i want to read joshua 1 and verse 5. there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee amen i'm thinking that another one over just a few pages back deuteronomy 31 and 7. this was moses i believe if i'm not wrong one of his last speeches and so forth and speaking to aaron in verse 6 31 6 says be strong enough good courage fear not neither be afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee and he will not fail thee nor forsake thee and then in i believe it's hebrews new testament bringing it over into the new testament hebrews 13. five and six thirteen five and six let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper i will not fear what man shall do unto me be god at his blessings to reading the words you can be seated tonight i want to title this supernatural intervention supernatural intervention or divine intervention amen amen you know it's quite something how that um we as human beings we will spend millions and billions of dollars to try to go out into space we will build these great big satellite dishes in that right and send signals out there and we are very curious of whether we're alone in the universe or not isn't that right and we'll spend billions of dollars lots of money amen and and even look for other worlds to see whether they're inhabitable or not i don't know about you but i think of what we got is pretty good amen i know it's a little overpopulated maybe but as far as nature and as far as what god's made is simply awesome isn't it how many knows there's places uh you know some of those rural areas out there i don't care if it's alaska i don't care if it's uh you know every different place has its beauty it's all made by god and yet man wants to try to you know still he's not satisfied am i right um what was it that the prophet of god said he says they're going to spend all this money trying to get a man to the moon and then when they do they're not going to find out anyway then all they gotta do is come back home you know that's about as much as consists of right but you know i i just love this thought because you know you know uh i'm thankful that we're not alone aren't you glad you're not alone i believe it was david that said you know i will not though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me amen that means that he is not alone i'm so glad that we are not alone in the universe but you know you don't have to look out there for some companionship or some aliens or some new life you know they should focus a whole lot more wouldn't it be much better if they would really take a good look at who really is here with us huh let's be so much better off if they check out who is with us right here amen and you know they'll dig in dirt they'll dig up fossils to figure out how long that we've been here and how that it was made huh isn't that right why don't they just believe what god said and it'd all be taken care of and you know the bad part is that they you know they even as the prophet god said the more they dig they more they prove creation you know every time they try to disprove god they just prove him that much the more and you know to have these inner i guess these space stations and so forth like i said and they try to find to hear a voice out there somewhere how much better they would be off if they try to hear the voice that's trying to talk to them all the time believe that god's trying to talk to the world he's trying to communicate to the world but they just aren't listening they want to go about it some other way i believe it's like god said that man is always going way over the top of things looking for something when it's right down there under him they need to look down here closer amen praise be to god you know it's something about you know if we didn't have the supernatural if we didn't have help from somewhere right if we didn't have help or intervention from the supernatural we would be in bad shape everybody wants to talk about how bad putin is how bad putin is let me tell you something without regeneration you're all bad everybody's as bad as putin if you ain't born again huh the only thing that'll help us the only thing that'll help is if god truly intervenes and he has intervened intervened hasn't he god has energy he got always in the supernatural oh my let me just go way ahead of myself here and you know even down to your daily food and clothes god intervenes for you amen every little detail god is there oh my if we could just know that it's there and believe that it's there that even around here if we could just look in that dimension huh how many knows if you could just tap right now into another another into another dimension into let's say the radio and television dimension if we would uh tap into every voice that's going through here you couldn't hear me for all the noise can you imagine all those voices and all those things bombarding this place all you'd have to do is get a radio and turn it up and the television turn it up it pulls it in from wherever and that right he's all traveling through here you just have the right thing to pull it up amen so it is i'm so glad i'm so glad that you don't have to be by yourself and not only that but he said about the church he says i'll never leave you i will be with you how jesus said i will be with you even in you to the end of the world here we are at the end of the world but we don't have to fear we don't have to be scared we can take courage why because he is the one that goes ahead how many knows he's already taken care of tomorrow he's taken care of next week he's taken care of next month he's taking care of your next year as a matter of fact he's taking care of your eternity he goes ahead of you i was meditating on this today and i was out there and he come to me and says you know amen if you really want god to intervene and take care of you on a daily basis in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path in other words when you get up and you pray in the morning you see god i can't go through this day without you taking care of me and directing my footsteps i want to acknowledge you now direct my every step intervene on my every behalf make sure i get stopped the dumb stop sign make sure i don't get right over back up watch out for me lord son in other ways acknowledge him and he'll direct your path he'll watch out for you i'm glad for a friend like that somebody that watches out for you intervenes on your behalf oh my praise be to god aren't you glad for a god like that that we serve and i got to thinking about it you know and every if they're always looking for something else they're looking for another world if they just realize what the bible says that this world is going to become they focus more on being ready for the world that is to come huh yeah you're not going to find the eons of billions of miles no it's god's going to redo this very earth right here and this is where we're going to live i'm not really interested in going past the stars in the moon god didn't make me to go to the past and the stars of the moon my my my what did what say one class he's when he goes to god he'll pass the moon so fast so you won't even see it you'll go so far out folks that ain't nothing moon ain't nothing for people of god amen praise the lord over into another dimension praise be oh my if the world if the world would just realize that there has never been in the history of the church a universal world over intervention by god shown like it was in your age and in my age never so many miracles never so many infallible proofs that god is real god is alive huh how many knows he came and intervened when we were in the biggest mess you ever saw 900 different churches down 900 different beliefs jesus comes right down in the middle it says y'all all wrong there's only one right way that's the bible quit putting your own interpretation and your own ideas to it come back to what paul said come back to the bible amen oh my my the fbi some preachers wanted to break up the meeting and say the xbi fbi is going to expose the prophets being false and so forth this that or the other and and they put all these flyers out when they come time everybody says you watch him now as a warrior he says you know it wasn't the fbi they don't care about those things the fbi that really did come investigate got saved [Laughter] oh the fbi god said they were better off than these backslidden preachers huh that's right they were better off than the backslidden preachers then he pointed it out no it was these preachers sitting up there in the white suit and that one over there don't down don't bend your head down and try to hide behind the other right there you you're the one that did it now if i'm simon the source there's come on down here come on down here stand by my sides because god said i'll be all right by you by your side and no man will ever stand in front of you they might die in front of you but they won't stand in front of you huh and we'll see who is right they cowered and ran out of the building i wonder where they are today i would dare say dead you know not sure because of their blasphemy or whatever but simply because of age also because it was so long ago amen oh my praise the lord you love him when i look at this and i look at the world over i look at our generation i mean those that there was time that jesus talked about this generation when he said a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and it won't be given the sign but the sign of the prophet of jonah but he was in the wells belly for three days and so forth come forth talking about the resurrection they'll be actually given the sign of the resurrection that brings that evil generation will be that was our generation given the sign of the resurrection but it was a wicked and adulterous generation i wrote down here you know the world has missed its opportunity folks i don't know about you i don't want to miss no opportunity it is depressing when you miss an opportunity in other words something that you could have had something that would have been but it isn't neither will it ever be because you made the wrong choice this world had the opportunity to see god they had opportunity to know who where it really all come from and what it was really all about when blind eyes were opened the deaf could hear huh no wonder no wonder the prophet said this message will have rapturing faith it's got rapturing faith in it there's rapturing faith in this message how many knows that if we ever have a body change if i ever change from this old tinkling and aging body it will take divine intervention [Music] it will take supernatural power amen not just natural power but russia is doing is natural power what hitler did was natural power what catholicism does is natural power kill you if you don't bow 68 million all they had was natural power but it took a supernatural power to walk out into those lions ends in the bed to die for the sake of the lord huh a supernatural power if you just have natural power this morning or this evening then all you have is religion that you have in your brains just in your mind that's just natural power a carnal understanding huh and that's what the majority of the world has but a supernatural understanding a supernatural power is something that is beyond natural now you and i we were made supernatural okay how does how do you do that well our body our flesh is natural right it doesn't do a lot for you but that second one we're made out of body and then we're made out of go ahead spirit we have flesh then we have spirit now how many knows that spirit that's not natural it's in the ghost world huh it's in the spirit world it's in a different dimension and it can be good or it can be bad huh that spirit realm that supernatural realm something beyond the natural is what you or i are governed by tonight it's what controls this flesh that wakes up in the morning and it can't hardly function without its coffee huh and if you feel me bad and depressed you get away from god and back sleep you are so miserable hey unregenerate people are miserable if you don't believe me go to walmart and to chair out for a little while and look at all the miserable people huh the whole world miserable well how do you justify that brother byler the laodiceans says they were wretched miserable poor blind and naked they're miserable they're poor they're blind that's right they're walking around blind they don't know where they're gonna end up at they don't know where they're going they don't know where they come from they don't know if they come from the chimpanzee or they don't know where to come they don't they're blind why all because they missed god's they missed god's intervention amen let me take i want to not lose this anointing but let me just go back for a minute how many remembers over in revelations it talks about a four winds hold the far winds and don't let them hurt the trees and all these other things until we have sealed our servants in our foreheads brother bam says they was riding on the decline of the first world war nobody knows today whoever made the issue of peace kasir wilhelm said he didn't do it no general said that he didn't do it but notice how strange it was it was on november the 11th at 11 o'clock in the day the 11th day of the month 11 11 month of the year eleventh hour of the day and eleven minutes to meet till till eleven what was it hold stop mysteriously what this it was god's issue went forth to hold huh hold the four winds hold these stripes and so forth hold it until we have sealed our servants in their foreheads in other words he says don't completely annihilate the world until israel gets sealed now he believes that's going to happen i believe it'll be after those jews get their ceiling that you'll see a complete annihilation i say annihilation you know what i mean that i completely burnt over amen but what was it it was god intervening i mean these and wars and all these different things that happen god intervenes i could i didn't have time or go over the old testament and you've already probably heard me say it before and read it before where god says the nations are just as a drop but as a bucket he says he god sets up who he wants and he take down who he was he was uh i'm not sure if a caesar remember that one one of the hebrew caesar or one of them that went out there and made himself to be a god and he died right there in the writing where he was sitting the skin words began to eat him up killed him right there on the spot because he made himself look like a god god can do anything he wants how many is glad that that god is absolutely in our lives and not just in our lives but he also deals with the people out there and the governments and everything else same way with russia and ukraine right now huh there was another there was different things i talked about i think brother pete a little bit but you know uh i've done a lot of study of world war ii and and germany and and all of those fights and all the different fights that they had and even the prophet of god brother brad mentioned it and so forth about the sacred line and different things that the prophet prophesied of and and so forth and uh you know things that was going to happen and and when we came to the end of fighting the germans and defeat them and so forth and one of our generals said you know let's go on into russia now we got these nukes we can take over the world huh and we had men that was trained our army was man they were in such a rhythm of overtaking things and over they were on a roll they was in the zone and they might just let's go ahead and take russia huh i thought about that many times why didn't they we wouldn't have all these problems every country that says no country against nukes except us every country we could have been a whole world over but guess what there was an interceding intervening right there even before that if you'll notice germany going into russia amen and they fought the russians all the way till they could see their capital but hitler wasn't too smart and the bible went on and on and on until winter it got so cold that most of their froze didn't have any winter clothes and then half of them are a lot of them froze to death frostbite and they just couldn't do it how many knows they could have never take the kremlin why because what the scripture says about what they're going to do so no matter what somebody tries to do if god don't allow it it ain't going to happen because there ain't no doubt how many there ain't no doubt but the english here with america no doubt they have dead as outnumbered outgunned militarized by a long shot but we still won why because it was meant to be god intervened and he gave us some victories and here because it had to fulfill the scriptures now hang on to your seats how many knows if he's behind the good work in you and that god is going to finish it no matter how many devils come your way and what happens god's going to see you through doesn't matter how odd how overwhelming the eyes are you're gonna make it [Applause] how many knows david the little bitty shrimp fella just a little natural looking man and a great big god that have nothing to do with it the supernatural intervene it wasn't david's arm or his sling or his soul it was the god that was all in it it ain't you and you're natural it is what god is in your heart in life that's what makes the difference let me tell you something joy is supernatural peace is supernatural you've got to have intervention from almighty god if you get it in your heart or you won't have it you can ask god to forgive you you can repent you can do all things but if god don't come down and forgive you and feel you you ain't gonna get it there has to be divine intervention something supernatural has to take place amen praise be to god people can't see god right man i look everywhere and i see god aren't you can't you see god everywhere sure you can you can watch him in wars you can watch him nature you can do and especially in your own life you can see you can look at his creation as you security yard you see god everywhere you can just look it up at the sun you can look up at the moon and see god because when that sun's just moving a little bit that moon just a little bit huh you think about it you think you know that it makes a perfect rotation exactly the way it is it's supposed to and it's never lost a minute as i know us it don't lose time it's directly on and that's gone praise god you love me it came to my mind in the church age book brother brandon put it this way he says you know these things saith the faithful and true witness now i want to show you what i find in the thought of faithful you know when we often talk about an unchangeable god whose word does not change and when we speak of him after the manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it is as though god made the whole whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then he stood back and became a great impersonal god it is as though god made a way of salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross then and then when the death of christ has atoned for our sin and his resurrection gave us an open door to him god just folded his arms and stood back [Music] amen how many said that we're not serving to god that he's folding his arms and he's standing back no he's very personal in your life and in my life every day every word that's you comes out of your mouth huh and more importantly you might never do things you know right outright but let me ask you this you don't have to do bad outright all you got to do is think it because the bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he you ain't getting away with nothing it doesn't even need to be not thinking because that's what i thought if i thought these what is this crazy thought go in my mind get out of my mind that's why i'm wicked get out of here huh i would never do something like that but that thought just tries to come back and get you to entertain it a little bit and i thought well you might never do it but look what the scripture says scripture says if you just think it in your heart so easy amen also that's not me that's not with the devil amen i'm sure we have thoughts isn't that right oh my think back moves and and as if we had listen it is as if we majored in believing in a great creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation now i say that is how too many people are apt to think isn't that the truth way too many people in the world think that god is just sitting back and he's not doing anything huh that he's not a personal god anymore then the bible says he says you know where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were they think god is not oh my they just don't know god do they they're just not his child until they can't see him nowhere they can't feel him nowhere because you cannot even see the kingdom of god jesus said unless you're born again ma you know how much god intervenes god intervenes so much that you can't even come to jesus unless god intervenes no man can come to me except my father does and some intervening your father has if you have that in your heart if you got a desire in your heart if that passion is in your heart yet oh my that ought to make you the happiest person in the world because a lot of people ain't got a feeling for it whatsoever there's no feeling there whatsoever and if you've got that feeling in your heart for god that is placed by the divine intervention of god people just don't care i don't care it's what kind of ins a statement insane that's right about a joke the man says it's an insane statement because it's insanity for you not to care you are way out there if you don't care about your soul about yourself amen oh my that's wrong thinking for god is governing in the affairs of men right now he is both creator and sustainer amen how many knows he's the one that creates it he's the one sustains it he's the one that keeps it going amen for by him are all things created colossians 1 16-17 that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be thrones and dominions and principalities powers all things we gave were created by him and for him he is before all things and by him all things consists amen in other words he keeps running smoothly i like that aren't you glad for the scripture says that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose everything works together for good god makes things work together for good in other words he is right there in your life and in my life making things work right many times we don't see it many times we're so well off and so busy with our things that it takes a hardship it takes something drastic it takes something an impasse to come our way trouble to come our way for god to really show himself huh israel was so carnal they were so natural amen so carnal they were so carnal that they did not believe in the supernatural let me just say this is a minister of the gospel according to the word of god they were denied to enter the rest because of their unbelief jesus said they're everyone dead why because they could never get in their minds that there is a supernatural god intervening on their behalf quit worrying about your food worrying about your clothes start worrying about pleasing god can i tell you something else i thought about brother glenn some brother brad talking about it and you know our goals and the bible says the scripture says set your things things on things above not on things below i look at myself and look at what everybody wants to do everybody wants to get rich everybody wants more money everybody wants worldly stuff and more worldly stuff and it's all worldly stuff i think i am i think we all can say we're still too attached to the things of this world because it's all going to go by the ways it all ain't going to matter after a while anyway it's all going to blow up it's all going to burn up [Music] but yet the world that's why jesus said watch it the gentiles seek after the things of this world he said right but seek ye first the kingdom of god and all these things will be taken care of make sure you're seeking the kingdom of god i wonder just how much our affections are affect on things above and not below how many could come to the altar for that yeah we could all come to the altar say god i'm guilty of that i've got my affections too much on the things of this world because in this age that we have the way that we're living things getting harder it kind of gets in every one of our little bit hey i better get more because i ain't going to get much after a while i better get me a bundle of two two by fours before they go up twice the price they are now huh i want to build a deck that's that's all man i could he built that for a thousand that's gonna cost me three grand huh better get it done quick but anyway too much on the things of the world lord help us to realize this world's gonna fall apart i'm gonna get ready for the new world don't you anyway just a thought ahead lord help us amen to look more to the supernatural another story that i really liked it has to do do with intervention in a in a in world war ii world war ii as you know hitler wanted to take france he took france he took italy and his next objective was to take england right churchill and all them and the allies had taken and they had come together and especially the majority of england soldiers had went to france to fight but they had very underestimated hitler's power and they got driven all the way back to a city called dunkirk into a little trap area somewhere and there was about 400 000 men from what i understand there that's a lot of folks my friend and as they were coming in and they call it the miracle of dunkirk and how many notes miracles just don't happen unless god's involved and right there they were right up close to dunkirk they had him cornered they had him right there and all of a sudden hitler makes a decision huh let me see if i can read this however in one of the most widely debated and potentially pivotal decisions of the war adolf hitler ordered his generals to halt for three days huh they had him on the run they had him and they stopped who does that who does that no that somebody somebody's got to intervene here right praise god for intervention you know listen for three days giving the allies time to organize and evacuate in the end despite heavy fire from german fighters and bomber planes on the beaches how many knows it was it was bad folks and i i don't know about you but i'm here to tell you i believe all of us in school if you want me to tell you what people ought to teach these teenagers you don't have to do them too young but when they get a teenager years and before they get to be an adult they need to know all these people that gave their lives in the most ruthless way for their freedoms because the wonder bunch we got right now they don't appreciate them at all neither do our government and so forth but those people died by the millions for freedom amen and they ought to teach it teach every bit of it instead they're teaching them to be racist don't you just love it people that say oh you're racist turn around hey let's teach racism to our children that's what it is a bunch of hypocrisy huh ah didn't politics no that's just plain right even brother bam talk about the black folks and so forth hello you know that to be great they should get better teaching right there amongst themselves and and martin luther and what he did how he led him was wrong demons says he was devilish right okay let me back it back to the normandy well not normandy but done kirk amen you could probably tell us stories about that brother and you probably know more about united but anyway so listen so that's right they were bombarded hey i don't know about you but it'd be it'd be terrible you know in no full-scale german attack was launched now listen before i tell you how many they rescued the evacuation was by no means straight forward before long the harbor became potentially blocked by ships sunk during the constant raids from enemy aircraft in other words when it could usually load them up they couldn't because there was a bunch of ships sitting there so it became necessary to take the troops off by nearby beaches how many knows eventually they had to take their jeeps and their trucks and farm their own ramp to get onto boats and so forth huh all right an almost impossible task because of shallow water which prevented large ships from coming close coming in close to shore small ships were needed to ferry the troops from the beaches to the larger ships now back up to the story now notice in the end he says despite heavy fire and gunship and so forth the beaches no full scale was launched and over 300 and 30 000 allied troops were eventually rescued that is a lot of soldiers folks and it said that uh churchill ordered he ordered uh different navy vessels and different ones to go and they says we expect we expect to be able to rescue about thirty thousand and they end up with three hundred and thirty how many believe things like that is divine intervention who in the world put it in hitler's mind hey let's just stop here uh they said it was a pivotal point because why if you didn't have any soldiers if england didn't have any soldiers they could have made it so much easier and everything else but god stops things he intercedes he intervenes same with many times you can find out and even even in that area if you'll notice that those sold on the ground they got a lot of relief because there was a lot of clays with cloud cover and those nose dive bombers couldn't come down through that see so as long as they had a lot of cloud cover they had a little rest god will even give cloud with clover where they need it aren't you glad for god that is governing and that cares about every detail of your life how many wants and more in your every everyday life lord jesus help me to realize you're not way off somewhere you're right here giving me supernatural power oh i like what brother batman his message is we're talking about a supernatural god with supernatural signs with a supernatural word preaching and so forth bringing it to a supernatural people how many believe the joy of the lord is supernatural peace of god is supernatural the joy of the lord is my strength talk about supernatural and spiritual power legion how many knows he had so many devils on him evil spirits on him that he made his frail body i am sure he looked like a druggie i'm sure he wasn't fed with a big bunch of steaks and everything he stayed in the grave i don't know where in the world he got all his food but listen he got so strong he would they would climb and change he'd break chains and that is the power of evil a supernatural evil power that caused him to be that strong we know that anybody that gets devil possessed and so forth that they get many times their strength that they would just normally lifting weights and becoming strong that's not it it's the spirit that's in them amen like that one stadium says you know it's not the size of the dog in the fight but it's the size of the fight that's in the doll and listen i like that because he says you know if an evil spirit could make somebody that strong to pray change and everything what what the holy ghost supposed to do to believer how many dollars the holy ghost is strength god is my strength and my refuge he's our strength amen that old 80 of some year old preacher coming up there on his overcoat but i'm saying why did they get the old geezer up now y'all forgot to give me i call old folks old geezers i'd take satami the other day i said check out what i got i'm not bad for an old geezer is it i call myself that so i hope that don't offend nobody but well i know what he's taking that old man up there when there's so many young people up there preaching to preach he got up there he got to thinking no doubt he got the preach he got under the anointing he kicked up his heels and scooped knowledge but he was preaching about the oh my the rainbow and coming back of christ and everything else you got so happy you ain't got enough room for me to preach up here huh oh my you get down on your knees you got to talk to the lord i may believe there's power in prayer why because you tap into the supernatural man if we need an electrical outlet to pluck in our power stuff we need a little bit of a plug in for our spiritual life that's why we come to church that's why we pray that's why we read because we need a charge from the lord to give us some power supernatural power the preacher needs it to preach with the congregation needs it to receive with oh my i like when you get a drill and you plug it in amen and you pull that trigger i'm telling you what the preacher gets the patient hey man if you're really plugged in and i like when the congregation gets a hey praise the lord glory but on the other hand preacher can't preach he ain't where he ought to be huh he can't preach congregation they're confused they get so you quiet hear a mouse run around huh no amens cold everybody can't wait for that preacher to quit i want to get in my car oh i got stuff to do get out of here this is too cold around here for me huh but you get the warmth of the holy spirit sheep that love each other you can't hear like barely get in your car to go fill us up a little longer huh talk and so forth and converse and so forth how many believes that that's what we need the supernatural power how many knows the greatest intervention that god ever did was when he sent jesus christ the great intervener between god and man we couldn't go behind that curtain we couldn't come into that presence you couldn't go into that holiness of holies you'll go behind that curtain and you will drop dead because right behind that curtain it's the sweetest awesomest peaceful greatest place there is how do you know brother butler i'm in it how do i know how do you know because you're in it you know it's peaceful you know it's awesome but you go in there with sin in the presence of awesome god and there's no atonement made for you drop dead fit to be in that presence huh jesus came to tear that curtain huh oh reagan said garbage off tear this wall down you know what he did amen god said to jesus tear that curtain in half let man come back to me whosoever will let him come he intervened supernaturally there was no egg there was no part of a sensation from mary with the holy ghost whatsoever on your nose it was supernatural on both parts it was god created in the womb of mary and his name was jesus he became the sacrifice for all of humanity he made a way back he stood in the middle he stood in the breach for us now all of man oh that's what we need to spend the money money on spreading that word telling the whole world about that how many please that's what that man we're wasting our money wasting our money for nothing oh my god tell them you can talk to somebody in outer space it's way out there somewhere past all of your galaxies and everything else he's way up in the heavens of heaven somewhere but you can have contact with him through jesus christ our lord and through faith in jesus christ and jesus christ came in our generation to prove he was real to prove god is real they wanted evidence they dig up evidence but they don't believe their very eyes when the eyes of the blind come open huh i'll give a thousand i'm a backslid preacher i'll give a thousand dollars to anybody that proves there's been a real divine healing they brought the doctor's statement and everything else here's your proof from a doctor that this had to be supernaturally done he still wouldn't believe well let me bring a child in here and cut the arm and then you do it you wouldn't believe the evidence you come up with some kind of a gimmick about that you are unbeliever you're a sinner on your way to hell because you won't believe right in front of you the evidence that's this world that's this generation they're on their way to hell because they wouldn't believe the evidence that was right in front of them that we're not alone they should check it out shouldn't they they should investigate the fact that no we are not alone amen god is with us god is in this universe that's who you need to be looking for amen how many believes we as christians need to be looking for him more in our daily lives as he intervenes as he leads and he guides us as he directs us as we acknowledge him in all of our ways he will direct our path i feel like jumping on top of this pulpit i'll hold myself but i'm telling you when i think about the fact that he said he would never leave you nor forsake you just like he told joshua i will be with you i will not leave you you're going to have somebody with you oh my what are we we don't have to fear anything for he is with us he is in us directing us don't you realize when somebody does you wrong he said don't take vengeance on people vengeance is mine saith the lord huh you realize when you just commit that to god you say boy i'm scared for that person but i pray god will have mercy isn't that right because they're not dying and dealing with me i don't have to get mad i don't have to get upset [Music] i can just commit it to god let me just finish with this god tried his best to get israel to trust in him isn't that right he first delivered him out of egypt says you ain't got to be no rebels in their eyes up for nothing i'll do it with one man moses i'll do the supernatural and all these flags and everything you see that's all god that's all god intervening and let him out and then he took him to the red sea and they began to murmur and complained they were all carnal huh lord help us not to be that way let us realize that god is with you he'll take care of it i guarantee you you'll be the kind of woman that god meant for you to be you'll be the kind of man that god meant for you to be when you commit all of your problems and all of the things that come your way to almighty god keep you cool committed to god keep a smile on your face keep friendly be nice god takes care of it all how many believes that god bless you let's give the lord a hand i'm so thankful that he is he'll never leave us nor forsake us amen just like he was with joshua just like he was with moses he was with joshua he was with jesus he was with paul he's always out here at the end he ain't gone yet he's right here with us and he's gonna make a way for you to go in the rapture he can change your body supernaturally just by the joy that he like the joy that he gives in your heart like the peace that passes understanding oh let me tell you that we ought to be the happy you oughta yeah i'm telling you as a christian we just don't have a place for a long face we really don't we ought to be the happiest people to know that you serve a god like that paul he was so happy he says if god be for us who in the world can be against us what can be against us he's the one that turns the tide he's the one that brings the clouds he's the one that makes it free so they can't come on into uh uh rush and so forth because they've got a purpose to do they've got to fulfill that part and we got to become so miserable wretched miserable poor blind and naked in a bunch of homosexual countries let me tell you if i was a dictator country i wouldn't be afraid of a no homosexual country either what are you going to do send the army homosexuals actress huh no they got no respect they have to become we have to become as a christian that is so horrible that they won't hesitate to blow us up huh how many know they will someday they've got a they've got a nuclear bomb with our name on it they sure do but hold back hold back you can't pull that lever you can't do it until the ceiling's gone until the chooser gets sealed until you and i are out of here amen because he provides a way god bless you let's stand amen thank you lord jesus thank you lord thank you jesus for being with us even in us thank you lord we bless your name we bless your name amen brother josh come up and see a couple songs if you will we'll turn it over to brother josh god bless y'all
