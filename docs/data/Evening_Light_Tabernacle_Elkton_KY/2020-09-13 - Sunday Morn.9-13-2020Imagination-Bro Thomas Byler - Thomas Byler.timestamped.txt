[45:05] our hearts now and speak to
[45:06] to our hearts father say what you once
[45:09] said lord jesus through your word father
[45:11] we truly believe with all of our heart
[45:13] father that you still
[45:15] are ministering lord jesus just like you
[45:17] did while you was here on earth
[45:19] and you're doing it through your people
[45:21] lord jesus and through the vessels that
[45:23] you've chosen father
[45:24] lord you're still the same yesterday
[45:26] today forever your ministry is the same
[45:28] and we just asked god that
[45:30] once again you would speak to your
[45:31] people as you did father
[45:33] lord jesus when you said come unto me
[45:35] all ye who are weary and heavy laden and
[45:37] i will give you rest
[45:39] father i truly believe you still speak
[45:41] father and we ask lord that you'll speak
[45:42] to us this morning now
[45:44] by the way of your word and that which
[45:46] you i feel lord that you've laid upon my
[45:47] heart to speak lord
[45:49] get me out of the way that you might
[45:50] just have your way this morning father
[45:52] and we thank you lord jesus for every
[45:54] heart lord and every
[45:56] soul that is coming to your house lord
[45:58] that cares enough about you that
[46:00] loves you enough father to come into
[46:01] your house and and to present themselves
[46:04] before you lord
[46:05] and we just ask god that you'll bless
[46:07] the reading of the word now in jesus
[46:08] christ's name
[46:10] amen and amen amen
[46:14] i think i will go to the very very
[46:16] scriptures
[46:18] very scripture that i begin to
[46:21] i think amen brought me to this subject
[46:24] amen and we'll get to the thought with
[46:26] the help of the lord
[46:27] and this morning sermon uh is going to
[46:31] be and i'm going to title this
[46:33] i mean it's off of a song that somebody
[46:35] wrote that i really like
[46:37] amen and that song is i can only imagine
[46:42] i can only imagine amen
[46:45] and so when i read this scripture
[46:49] that song and that word came into my
[46:52] mind so we'll title that
[46:53] i can only imagine if that's okay
[46:58] revelations 1 it turned to revelations 1
[47:00] with me if you will
[47:13] i'm not going to detail on this until a
[47:15] little bit later and
[47:17] so as i begin to study i do have a lot
[47:20] of scriptures we could probably take
[47:22] about 30 minutes just reading the
[47:23] scriptures that i've got
[47:25] so amen just hang on to your seats i
[47:28] guess for a while amen
[47:30] so so we don't we'll just see how the
[47:32] lord will go and how it'll go
[47:34] because i amen may give an opportunity
[47:37] for an altar afterwards
[47:39] because it is it'll be one of the most
[47:42] serious well it is the most serious
[47:46] type of messages that your man could
[47:48] preach amen because it does have to do
[47:50] with judgment
[47:51] and mercy amen and the day of the lord
[47:53] coming and being ready for his coming
[47:55] amen
[47:56] so i believe it's very very vital but
[47:59] in verse chapter revelations chapter 1
[48:04] and verse 7
[48:08] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[48:11] eye shall see him and they also which
[48:13] pierced him
[48:14] and all kindreds of the earth shall well
[48:16] because of him
[48:18] even so amen i am the alpha
[48:21] and the omega the beginning in the end
[48:23] saith the lord
[48:24] which is and which was and which is to
[48:27] come
[48:28] the almighty now if you will turn over
[48:31] to the book of genesis
[48:33] amen we want to begin to talk about
[48:35] imagination
[48:37] amen imagination and that's what we're
[48:39] going to dwell with for just a little
[48:41] bit
[48:42] amen and then we're going to move on to
[48:43] a couple different
[48:45] directions in genesis the
[48:49] 6th chapter
[48:52] genesis 6.
[49:02] and not having preached on this
[49:05] and certainly not being a specialist in
[49:08] um explaining words
[49:13] i just trust the lord will be able to
[49:14] convey to you what
[49:16] really is in my mind chapter 6
[49:19] and verse 5.
[49:22] and god saw the wickedness of man was
[49:25] great
[49:26] in the earth and that every imagination
[49:31] of the thoughts of his heart was only
[49:34] evil
[49:35] continually amen now go to another one
[49:39] on talking about imagination and that is
[49:42] in revelation i mean in genesis 11 let's
[49:45] go and talk a little bit more about
[49:46] imagination for just a minute
[49:59] genesis 11 and we'll read one through
[50:01] nine
[50:03] it says and the whole earth was of one
[50:05] language and of one speech
[50:09] and it came to pass as they journeyed
[50:11] from the east
[50:12] that they found a plane in the land of
[50:15] shinar
[50:16] and they dwelt there and they said one
[50:18] to another
[50:20] let go to let us make brick
[50:25] and burn them thoroughly that they had
[50:29] and they have brick for stone and slime
[50:34] they had for mortar and they said go to
[50:37] let us build us a city and a tower
[50:41] whose top may reach unto heaven
[50:44] and let us make let us make us a name
[50:47] least we be scattered abroad upon the
[50:50] face of the whole earth
[50:52] and the lord came down to the city and
[50:54] to the tower which the
[50:56] children of men had built it and the
[50:58] lord said
[51:00] see behold the people is one and they
[51:03] are
[51:03] all one language and this they begin to
[51:06] do
[51:07] and now nothing will be restrained
[51:11] from them which they have imagined
[51:14] to do go to let us go down
[51:18] now and confound their language that
[51:20] they may not understand one another's
[51:21] speech
[51:22] so that the lord scattered them abroad
[51:25] from tents upon the face of the
[51:27] all the earth and they left off to build
[51:30] the city
[51:31] therefore is the name of it called babel
[51:35] how many knows that that's what's the
[51:37] first babylon
[51:39] that's where about the first bible amen
[51:42] because
[51:42] to everybody everybody was babbling you
[51:45] know just it was it's confusion
[51:48] babel means confusion amen
[51:51] so this was the first babylon and we've
[51:53] had several different babylons and
[51:55] there's a babylon right over at the end
[51:57] of the
[51:57] whole revelations which we won't get
[52:00] into but
[52:01] so he says it was called babel because
[52:03] the lord did confound the language of
[52:06] all the earth and from fence that the
[52:08] lord scattered them abroad
[52:10] upon the face of the earth all right may
[52:11] god had his blessings to the reading of
[52:13] the word
[52:13] you can be seated now how many knows
[52:15] that the children of men wanted to build
[52:17] a tower so that guess what
[52:19] pretty much so no matter how deep the
[52:20] water got they could actually go up and
[52:22] climb up above it
[52:24] and god says here that you know nothing
[52:27] and now
[52:28] nothing will be restrained from them
[52:31] which they have imagined to do
[52:36] amen we're going to dwell on that for
[52:38] just a little bit talking about
[52:40] imagination now first he talks about
[52:42] over in genesis there
[52:44] that the wickedness of man was great and
[52:46] he says
[52:47] it was the imagination of his thoughts
[52:51] amen so he ties our imagination to our
[52:53] thoughts because how many knows that's
[52:55] where your imagination
[52:56] comes from is from a thought from your
[53:00] thoughts amen and we know that even god
[53:03] even god before the foundation of the
[53:06] world we could say
[53:07] you know before there was anything made
[53:09] god what
[53:10] what did he do he thought all this isn't
[53:12] that right so
[53:14] in his mind he thought he imagined it he
[53:17] imagined
[53:18] everything that was going to happen only
[53:20] god's imaginations and god's thoughts
[53:22] they're not something
[53:23] you know because many times we think of
[53:25] imagination as being something that is
[53:27] mystical
[53:28] because then let me say this there's two
[53:31] kinds of
[53:32] imaginations one of them truly is
[53:34] mystical
[53:35] but the other one is real it just
[53:38] depends on what you're imagining
[53:39] and what you're thinking about what your
[53:41] thoughts are are they god's thoughts or
[53:43] are they your thoughts and we know that
[53:45] every movie that is made all come from
[53:48] the
[53:48] imagination amen and here
[53:52] even here the building of the city ups
[53:54] the first thing you gotta do is you got
[53:55] to imagine it
[53:56] it has to be in your mind you have to
[53:58] have it fixed in your mind amen
[54:01] and so here he says that even god said
[54:03] look there's almost
[54:04] going to be nothing impossible
[54:08] how does he put it again there will be
[54:11] nothing
[54:12] restraint from them
[54:15] amen and we know that even today
[54:18] amen is if because of their imagination
[54:23] amen there's almost nothing that people
[54:25] can't do
[54:27] amen or put it this way
[54:30] almost everything that they can imagine
[54:33] they can do
[54:35] is that right that's where humanity is i
[54:38] mean
[54:38] years ago we would have uh you know we'd
[54:41] you know
[54:41] we'd have never thought about talking to
[54:43] our phone and being able to
[54:45] pull up any information and that they
[54:48] would talk back and
[54:49] you know all of the automated systems
[54:51] that they have nowadays of
[54:53] amen when you get on the phone and it is
[54:54] most irritating to me i like to talk
[54:56] with somebody don't you
[54:58] amen and most of the time those
[55:00] automated things are better than
[55:02] better for giving you a run around than
[55:04] a person is
[55:06] the only kind of automated phone calls
[55:08] that i like
[55:09] is the one that they call me in that
[55:11] right and i say okay
[55:13] you know they're trying to sell you
[55:14] something the second
[55:16] that i see that it's a machine i don't
[55:19] mind
[55:20] hidden in do you it doesn't make me feel
[55:23] one bad at all now
[55:24] if it's a person it that bothers you a
[55:27] little bit you don't want to hang up on
[55:29] a person it's not polite
[55:32] but when that machine doesn't stop
[55:34] talking and they understand what i just
[55:36] said i realize
[55:37] it's a machine you know and if it isn't
[55:40] and if a person just keeps babbling hey
[55:42] i'll probably hang up on you because you
[55:44] are being real rude here not even listen
[55:46] to what i'm saying
[55:47] but anyway so you know we look at the
[55:49] world we're living in
[55:51] and it is absolutely you know phenomenal
[55:55] at what man can do we realize that
[55:58] because
[55:58] people imagined that we could actually
[56:01] go to the
[56:02] moon and you know how many knows it was
[56:04] one what was it one
[56:05] small step for man but one
[56:09] giant st for mankind when we stepped on
[56:11] the moon isn't that right
[56:13] because they imagined it amen and i
[56:17] can't imagine if you uh
[56:19] um you know if you told people you know
[56:23] back in the 1700s
[56:26] you know if you just said you know one
[56:28] day man is
[56:30] going to go up there to that moon well
[56:32] you would have been class in your city
[56:34] among your people as a crazy person
[56:38] isn't that right they'd say what are you
[56:41] going to do drive your horse up there
[56:44] you know how you're going to get up
[56:46] there you know even how many knows even
[56:48] flying at one time was out of people
[56:51] you're going to fly through the sky if
[56:52] you told people back then
[56:54] that we was going to fly through the
[56:55] skies you know
[56:57] with 600 people in one place they just
[57:00] thought it was crazy
[57:02] and so many things many many things that
[57:04] people thought could never happen you
[57:06] know
[57:07] and and brother madame talks about how
[57:09] that man is even
[57:10] actually trying to go in and figure out
[57:13] how life where life comes from
[57:17] amen he says they'll get really close
[57:19] and they're almost getting there before
[57:21] the preachers get there realizing where
[57:23] life really comes from
[57:24] we've already realized how that we can
[57:26] take now i guess uh
[57:28] you know cells and put them together and
[57:31] create this and create that and
[57:33] and they're you know doing different
[57:35] things with even the cells that they
[57:36] could have never done at one time
[57:39] but you know before before thomas edison
[57:41] and before
[57:42] uh benjamin franklin they had something
[57:44] in their mind they
[57:45] they imagine you know that kite and that
[57:48] string that
[57:49] power can be controlled and electricity
[57:52] can be controlled and
[57:53] perhaps it can be channeled and perhaps
[57:57] thomas edison had in his mind and in his
[57:59] imagination that
[58:00] you know we can make this ball we can
[58:02] make something and we can take this
[58:03] power
[58:04] and we can actually light this place up
[58:06] and look what we got
[58:08] amen we're doing all of it because man
[58:11] and his imagination it is it is very
[58:14] very powerful i mean the imagination is
[58:18] very
[58:18] very powerful amen your mind let me tell
[58:22] you something how many believes that
[58:23] your mind
[58:25] is very very powerful
[58:28] now y'all remember by the ban i'm saying
[58:30] one place he says that he knew of a man
[58:32] that could take just his mind
[58:34] and burst of glass y'all remember that
[58:37] he could actually do that with his mind
[58:39] to you and me molly he's
[58:43] got to have faith that's got his point i
[58:44] want to get to
[58:47] if man can almost do anything
[58:50] in his imagination hello what
[58:53] can children of god do by the
[58:57] unfallible word of god
[59:01] amen there's only one there's only one
[59:05] difference between imagination
[59:06] and fiction and one is something that
[59:09] people do
[59:10] and the other one is what god's word
[59:13] says
[59:14] one is real and one is not real amen one
[59:17] last
[59:18] one don't last in your mind let me tell
[59:20] you something your mind is
[59:22] a precious thing this morning
[59:25] amen because i want to tell you amen you
[59:28] know there's times that i can go down
[59:30] and
[59:30] the road and i'll be driving down the
[59:32] road and i can think of what perhaps
[59:34] would happen with me
[59:36] if i was in a wreck or you know i was in
[59:39] a ditch somewhere
[59:40] and what call i would be making if i was
[59:42] dying and what i would say
[59:44] or i think about my kids or somebody on
[59:47] a loved one perhaps perhaps if they got
[59:49] to that place and they gave me a call
[59:50] amen and i can cause myself to cry just
[59:53] because of my imagination
[59:57] and really go to boohoo and just because
[1:00:00] i imagined something
[1:00:02] doesn't happen didn't happen hope it
[1:00:04] never does but you can go
[1:00:05] places and make yourself cry
[1:00:09] it affects your emotion how many
[1:00:11] realizes that
[1:00:12] even the bible talks about how that we
[1:00:14] are to what
[1:00:15] meditate upon the lord upon our beds
[1:00:19] think about him because the things that
[1:00:21] you think about
[1:00:22] the things that you imagine the things
[1:00:24] that goes through your mind affects
[1:00:28] it's who you are it affects your
[1:00:30] emotions it affects your feelings
[1:00:35] it affects every you don't realize it
[1:00:37] creates your whole thing let me say this
[1:00:39] that
[1:00:39] our imagination or our mind and our
[1:00:43] thoughts brother venom says
[1:00:44] the mind was a what a womb
[1:00:48] and that right your mind is a womb a
[1:00:51] womb is a place where things are born
[1:00:54] is that right where things are formed
[1:00:57] where babies are formed
[1:00:58] in a mother's womb a baby is formed in
[1:01:00] that mother's womb
[1:01:01] amen and i believe that even even even
[1:01:04] mary had to take into her mind
[1:01:07] and she had to accept what that angel
[1:01:09] said
[1:01:10] before she could ever become pregnant
[1:01:12] with jesus christ
[1:01:13] and before you and i will ever get
[1:01:15] anywhere with almighty god you have got
[1:01:17] to take
[1:01:17] and think about the word of god and what
[1:01:20] he said
[1:01:21] before it will ever materialize to you
[1:01:24] because barbara said the word of god is
[1:01:26] a seed
[1:01:27] now right how many means it's a seed and
[1:01:30] as you think on these things
[1:01:32] what does the bible say whatever things
[1:01:34] are good whatever things are lovely
[1:01:37] whatever things are of good report
[1:01:41] amen how many likes a good report think
[1:01:43] on good things
[1:01:44] and then think on these things
[1:01:48] now we preachers we preachers use
[1:01:50] imagination i use my imagination a lot
[1:01:55] brother branham used his imagination a
[1:01:57] lot
[1:01:58] and i looked up on on on imagination and
[1:02:02] i can imagine i can imagine and i think
[1:02:05] it was 275 some odd times
[1:02:07] that brother banned him in telling
[1:02:08] stories all right amen when he was
[1:02:10] talking about sarah
[1:02:12] and abraham abraham and uh no
[1:02:15] moses and his wife remember moses and
[1:02:17] his wife on the back side of the desert
[1:02:20] he said that she was a hot tempered
[1:02:22] woman
[1:02:23] he says i imagine they had quite a few
[1:02:25] things going on back there and that
[1:02:27] right they had quite some time he would
[1:02:28] imagine this and he would
[1:02:30] and brother bannon would dramatize a lot
[1:02:32] of time preachers dramatized amen i love
[1:02:34] to dramatize i like to imagine
[1:02:37] bible stories i like to imagine amen
[1:02:40] david and goliath and how it was
[1:02:44] is that right and i can picture the he
[1:02:46] you know
[1:02:47] you know that he was on i could picture
[1:02:49] goliath and what he was saying
[1:02:50] amen i can picture david going down in
[1:02:53] between these two hills
[1:02:54] amen and but you know if if it was ever
[1:02:57] played back
[1:02:59] i guarantee you this that hill wouldn't
[1:03:01] be like i thought the creek wouldn't be
[1:03:02] like i thought
[1:03:04] the setting would be completely
[1:03:06] different because this is just my
[1:03:07] imagination
[1:03:09] all right but the bible does describe a
[1:03:11] hill it talks about a cr
[1:03:12] a creek of five smooth stones anybody
[1:03:15] talks about it and so forth
[1:03:16] you know but we imagine and we kind of
[1:03:18] dramatize
[1:03:20] amen and i love to dramatize i love
[1:03:23] to hear brother branham dramatize about
[1:03:26] many different things he used
[1:03:27] many different types many different
[1:03:29] dramas isn't that right that he would
[1:03:30] picture and he would get the people
[1:03:32] even in their mind and to get their
[1:03:34] picture in there
[1:03:35] because that's what imagination does it
[1:03:37] gives you a picture of something
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:44] and it is dwelling and i thought about
[1:03:47] this could also be
[1:03:48] kind of the second part two of looking
[1:03:50] to the unseen
[1:03:53] is that right looking to the unseen
[1:03:57] all right so let's look at it because
[1:03:59] that's what you and i
[1:04:00] look to we look at things that are not
[1:04:02] seen how many believes that
[1:04:04] and i think in second corinthians let me
[1:04:06] go to it real quick can i read you a
[1:04:07] couple scriptures here
[1:04:13] in second corinthians paul said we read
[1:04:16] it last week
[1:04:17] he says that while we look not at things
[1:04:20] which are seen but the things which
[1:04:22] are not seen for the things which are
[1:04:25] seen are temporal but the things which
[1:04:27] are not seen
[1:04:28] are eternal now we also realize that how
[1:04:32] many knows that faith
[1:04:33] prophet of god said that faith is a long
[1:04:36] range
[1:04:37] vision how many believe that faith has
[1:04:41] eyes faith can see things
[1:04:45] real genuine and that's the difference
[1:04:47] there's a big difference between you
[1:04:48] just imagining something
[1:04:50] really real and faith taking hold and
[1:04:52] beginning to give you a vision
[1:04:54] begin to let you see things huh
[1:04:58] that god's word says god's promises
[1:05:01] these things
[1:05:02] and by eyes of faith you see them now i
[1:05:05] want to say this this morning real
[1:05:07] clear amen that we get much more excited
[1:05:10] about things that we see with our
[1:05:12] natural eyes
[1:05:13] than what we do with the things that are
[1:05:15] really real that you can't see with your
[1:05:18] natural eyes
[1:05:21] lord help us this morning let's just
[1:05:23] move a little bit further away
[1:05:25] from the things that your natural eyes
[1:05:27] can see and to the spiritual things to
[1:05:29] the other things that you can't see
[1:05:31] but yet they are more real how many
[1:05:34] believes that the things that you cannot
[1:05:36] see are the only things that
[1:05:38] are real paul said that the things that
[1:05:40] you can see with your eyes right here
[1:05:44] they're all temporary they'll all perish
[1:05:48] but it's what you can't see that's
[1:05:50] eternal
[1:05:53] i'm looking at you and i see us each and
[1:05:56] every one of you
[1:05:58] but i can't see that holy ghost that's
[1:06:00] on the inside
[1:06:01] but that holy ghost on the inside that's
[1:06:03] the only thing that's real
[1:06:05] that soul that's on the inside of this
[1:06:07] body that's what's real
[1:06:10] that's what's eternal
[1:06:13] so we want to turn your eyes away from
[1:06:16] the things that you can see
[1:06:18] amen and to the things that you cannot
[1:06:21] see
[1:06:23] i want to turn to another to another one
[1:06:28] amen now
[1:06:31] another something that sees things
[1:06:37] but it isn't there it isn't there yet
[1:06:42] i should have brought my ink pen
[1:06:46] okay romans 8
[1:06:50] romans 8
[1:06:58] and the second thing i want to go to
[1:07:01] and talk to you about that is not seen
[1:07:06] but yet it's real
[1:07:10] and it is in our imagination
[1:07:13] in our thoughts and the things that we
[1:07:15] imagine
[1:07:19] and that is in romans 8 and then we
[1:07:21] begin with
[1:07:24] verse 24 for we are
[1:07:28] saved by hope
[1:07:31] all right we're saved by hope
[1:07:34] let's talk about hope for a little bit
[1:07:38] hope but hope
[1:07:41] that is seen is not hope
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:49] what does the bible talks about the hope
[1:07:51] that we have which is both sure
[1:07:53] and steadfast how many's got a hope
[1:07:57] that's right many many words i could
[1:07:59] take the whole sermon on just hope
[1:08:01] the hope that we have you know
[1:08:05] there's a scripture it says something
[1:08:06] about always be ready to give a reason
[1:08:10] of the hope that life in you amen
[1:08:13] in other words always be ready to
[1:08:14] testify of the hope that you have
[1:08:19] brother brandon one time brother brahm
[1:08:22] do you believe that you're a son of god
[1:08:24] you believe you're saved you know what
[1:08:26] he said
[1:08:27] i hope
[1:08:31] whoa not a really most of us message you
[1:08:34] yeah absolutely for sure i know it
[1:08:36] without it
[1:08:37] i hope so huh
[1:08:42] yeah i was shocked i was like yeah he
[1:08:44] just said i hope
[1:08:46] i i think if i'm not wrong after that i
[1:08:48] believe i am
[1:08:50] i believe it huh
[1:08:53] because why you believe you're saved
[1:08:56] but guess what
[1:09:01] when we get over there it won't be hope
[1:09:03] anymore
[1:09:05] it'll be seen we know now you know
[1:09:08] whether you've got the holy ghost how
[1:09:09] many believe that
[1:09:10] because paul says we're saved by hope
[1:09:13] you're saved by hope
[1:09:14] we don't hear that a lot either do we no
[1:09:17] you hope you're saved
[1:09:19] it's through faith it's through
[1:09:21] believing god that you're saved
[1:09:23] but hope that is seen
[1:09:27] is not hope now another place if
[1:09:30] in this world we only have hope in
[1:09:32] christ we're all
[1:09:34] of all men most miserable in other words
[1:09:36] i hope i have the holy ghost
[1:09:38] you better have a little more than that
[1:09:43] you don't want to have just hope that
[1:09:44] you have christ you have to have christ
[1:09:46] you have to be born again you have to be
[1:09:49] filled with the spirit
[1:09:50] amen amen for what man
[1:09:54] seeth why does he yet hope
[1:09:57] for it but if we hope for that we see
[1:10:01] not
[1:10:02] then do we with patience wait for it
[1:10:07] amen so a lot of times in the past
[1:10:09] everything in the past
[1:10:11] you kind of picture you imagine it
[1:10:14] we imagine what happened with david and
[1:10:16] goliath
[1:10:18] we imagine amen just how it went with
[1:10:21] the three hebrew children
[1:10:22] amen you look back but now when you
[1:10:25] wonder
[1:10:27] i wonder what laodicea will look like
[1:10:30] i wonder what sodom and gomorrah was
[1:10:32] like you don't have to
[1:10:33] hope yet you get to see what it's like
[1:10:36] amen all of those things you see
[1:10:37] them now you see them right there
[1:10:41] but in the future everything that's in
[1:10:43] the future
[1:10:44] you still have to look through the eyes
[1:10:47] of hope
[1:10:48] is that right because you don't see it
[1:10:50] yet how many believe that
[1:10:52] you know we get in our mind and we
[1:10:54] imagine in our mind
[1:10:56] what it's going to be like when we see
[1:10:58] our loved ones appear
[1:10:59] when the rapture takes place
[1:11:07] remember when you get it all figured out
[1:11:09] knowing
[1:11:10] you're going to be wrong it isn't going
[1:11:13] to be
[1:11:14] like you imagined amen how many knows
[1:11:17] that was the problem with the pharisees
[1:11:20] is that they did
[1:11:24] they have the eyes of their heart opened
[1:11:26] to see the lord
[1:11:29] they imagined that he would come to them
[1:11:31] he would come on a white carpet he would
[1:11:33] come in a certain way
[1:11:34] the messiah would come in a certain way
[1:11:36] they had it in their imagination of how
[1:11:38] it would come and when it didn't come
[1:11:39] according to their imagination
[1:11:41] they rejected it the eyes of their heart
[1:11:45] was not open
[1:11:46] god help us this morning i want you to
[1:11:48] know that if god don't open the eyes of
[1:11:50] your heart
[1:11:51] you'll never see christ you
[1:11:54] won't see him it takes god to open up
[1:11:57] the eyes of your heart
[1:11:59] to see him praise the lord
[1:12:03] we take the eyes the spiritual eyes that
[1:12:07] we have
[1:12:08] we take our imagination back to calgary
[1:12:11] how many believes that
[1:12:12] oh my even when you come to the altar
[1:12:15] you imagine
[1:12:16] that you're kneeling in front of the
[1:12:17] cross you're
[1:12:19] feeling in front of jesus christ and
[1:12:21] you're saying here i am lord
[1:12:24] now those kind of thoughts and that kind
[1:12:26] of imagine is not wrong that's correct
[1:12:29] you have to come down and you believe
[1:12:30] that he's there because you have to
[1:12:32] accept calvary
[1:12:33] and what he did for you on calvary amen
[1:12:37] even dramatizing the cross as brother
[1:12:41] bam did
[1:12:42] amen as he was going down the road and
[1:12:44] uh the the cobblestone street and we
[1:12:47] imagined
[1:12:47] we imagine how it was and but yet it
[1:12:49] probably a little different what we
[1:12:50] imagined
[1:12:51] but we know he went on cobblestone
[1:12:53] streets and the drug is crossed
[1:12:54] and then he was going boom boom boom and
[1:12:56] there he was and he was bloody
[1:12:58] he had spit hanging on his eyebrow he
[1:13:01] might spit all over his face and there
[1:13:03] he was just bloody
[1:13:04] look at his back if his rib showed amen
[1:13:07] when he beat him so hard he cuts his
[1:13:09] flesh open
[1:13:10] and there he was and he was so weak and
[1:13:12] shivering because he just didn't have
[1:13:14] any strength to go anymore
[1:13:16] and he went down on his knees and he
[1:13:18] couldn't go no more he met another
[1:13:19] person picked up the cross isn't that
[1:13:21] right
[1:13:22] amen impact before him because he was so
[1:13:25] weak
[1:13:26] hallelujah praise be to god i thank god
[1:13:30] for being able to imagine
[1:13:32] something like that you begin to imagine
[1:13:34] that amen and god brings this blessing
[1:13:36] down because i want you to know
[1:13:38] amen when you begin to think about him
[1:13:41] he always comes near how many believes
[1:13:45] our minds is
[1:13:45] important the thoughts that you think
[1:13:49] are important the things that you
[1:13:51] envision
[1:13:52] are important amen amen in the days of
[1:13:56] noah
[1:13:56] the thoughts and the imagination of
[1:13:59] man's heart
[1:14:00] was only evil continually amen what kind
[1:14:03] of saints
[1:14:04] and when would we be if our sought for
[1:14:07] completely
[1:14:08] holy and righteous always it would bring
[1:14:11] the presence of god into your heart
[1:14:13] like you've never seen before
[1:14:16] amen but we have our mind
[1:14:20] and our eyes so much on everything that
[1:14:23] we see
[1:14:25] the things of this world rather than
[1:14:28] things that are unseen
[1:14:31] amen praise the lord
[1:14:36] so we look here we see it's not the
[1:14:39] things
[1:14:40] that are seen that are eternal but it's
[1:14:44] the things that's
[1:14:44] unseen that are eternal
[1:14:48] praise be to god
[1:14:51] second corinthians two
[1:14:57] and verse 5 says it this way
[1:15:02] that's your faith hold on a minute
[1:15:05] second i'm on first corinthians
[1:15:18] ii corinthians 5 and
[1:15:22] verse 7.
[1:15:29] it says for we walk by faith
[1:15:33] and not by sight how many beliefs that's
[1:15:36] what we do
[1:15:38] every real genuine son of god walks
[1:15:41] by faith and not by sight
[1:15:50] what did that prophet teach is that if
[1:15:52] you're sick imagine yourself well
[1:15:55] can't move the arm imagine yourself
[1:15:57] moving that arm
[1:15:59] begin to think that you can move that
[1:16:02] arm
[1:16:03] why because you're walking and living by
[1:16:06] faith
[1:16:07] and not by sight you can't look at the
[1:16:10] symptoms isn't that right
[1:16:11] you can't look at the conditions you
[1:16:14] can't look at your human failure you've
[1:16:16] got to look at the cross
[1:16:18] it's all about what you're looking at
[1:16:19] this morning about what we're looking at
[1:16:22] moses amen when he looked through the
[1:16:24] eyes of faith it was a supernatural
[1:16:25] and he esteemed the reproaches of of god
[1:16:28] greater riches than all the treasures of
[1:16:30] egypt
[1:16:31] amen we walk not by sight
[1:16:35] but we walk by faith amen
[1:16:39] and so this scripture comes to me and
[1:16:42] humanity as a whole
[1:16:44] they pretty much walk by sight
[1:16:48] the pharisees they walked by sight just
[1:16:51] about
[1:16:52] what they could see naturally and i want
[1:16:55] you to know that before
[1:16:56] the word of god will ever be a
[1:16:58] revelation to you
[1:16:59] before it'll ever become a reality to
[1:17:02] you god has to open up your spiritual
[1:17:04] eyes
[1:17:05] to see amen
[1:17:10] this scripture came to me let me go in a
[1:17:12] different direction the kind of
[1:17:13] direction that kind of led to first this
[1:17:14] morning
[1:17:16] and over in revelations i can only
[1:17:20] imagine so this morning we realized
[1:17:24] there's
[1:17:24] all kinds of things there's a lot of
[1:17:27] things that we can only
[1:17:29] imagine and then all we can do now
[1:17:33] is to look by faith we can only imagine
[1:17:36] it
[1:17:37] but we know if it's the word of god it
[1:17:39] is going to come to pass
[1:17:41] it will happen if man could do almost
[1:17:44] anything
[1:17:45] by their imagination amen then much
[1:17:48] more can we do as sons and daughters of
[1:17:52] god
[1:17:53] believing in the word of god and seeing
[1:17:56] the word of god
[1:17:57] now notice here
[1:18:00] first of all i want to read from
[1:18:03] revelations one
[1:18:08] and three actually start with 4
[1:18:13] chapter 4 to verse 6. two categories of
[1:18:16] people
[1:18:18] john to the seven churches which are in
[1:18:20] asia grace be unto you at peace
[1:18:24] from him which is and which was
[1:18:27] and which is to come and from the seven
[1:18:30] spirits which are before the throne
[1:18:32] and from peace who is the faithful
[1:18:35] witness
[1:18:36] and the first begotten of the dead the
[1:18:40] prince of the kings of the earth
[1:18:43] unto him now notice this is talking to
[1:18:46] us
[1:18:47] unto him that loved us
[1:18:50] and washed us from our sins in
[1:18:54] his own blood
[1:18:57] amen and hath made us
[1:19:00] kings and priests unto god and his
[1:19:04] father
[1:19:04] to him be glory and dominion forever
[1:19:08] and ever
[1:19:11] and then it says behold he cometh with
[1:19:14] clouds
[1:19:15] and every eye shall
[1:19:19] see him
[1:19:24] every eye shall see him
[1:19:28] and they also which pierced him and
[1:19:31] all kindreds of the earth shall well
[1:19:33] because of him
[1:19:34] even so amen
[1:19:38] now if you'll notice isn't it peculiar
[1:19:41] that in the middle of that that he would
[1:19:44] add in there
[1:19:45] every eye shall see him and they also
[1:19:49] which pierced him
[1:19:53] amen so he puts in there that even those
[1:19:56] back then are going to see him one day
[1:20:02] now we see him through the eyes of faith
[1:20:04] we have seen him
[1:20:06] and we have heard jesus christ and do
[1:20:09] great miracles in this generation i mean
[1:20:12] we know that god is alive and god has
[1:20:15] come
[1:20:16] and he has washed us from our sins we
[1:20:18] have accepted the benefit of believing
[1:20:20] in him
[1:20:23] but we're living in a world folks and
[1:20:26] even these people remember
[1:20:28] remember these people that pierced him
[1:20:29] and said away with him away with him
[1:20:31] crucified
[1:20:32] and they were saying if thou be the
[1:20:34] christ come down off the cross we'll
[1:20:36] believe you
[1:20:37] god himself he said when every eye shall
[1:20:40] see me when i come with clouds i want
[1:20:43] you to understand
[1:20:45] that even the people that were at the
[1:20:47] cross
[1:20:48] even the people that pierced me they're
[1:20:51] gonna
[1:20:51] look at me
[1:20:57] huh and this is why i begin to think
[1:21:01] i can only imagine
[1:21:04] what that's going to be like brotherhood
[1:21:07] what's it going to be like
[1:21:09] i can only imagine when all the kindreds
[1:21:12] of the earth and all those that pierced
[1:21:15] him
[1:21:16] all those that served and what does he
[1:21:18] do they're going to see me they're going
[1:21:19] to look upon me
[1:21:20] i'm going to show them my hands i'm
[1:21:23] going to show my side
[1:21:26] and what is that going to do to those
[1:21:28] folks
[1:21:30] what's it going to do to those people
[1:21:32] that
[1:21:33] even deny there's a god
[1:21:36] because how many knows that on the day
[1:21:39] of judgment
[1:21:40] the thing that is going to be asked the
[1:21:42] question that's going to be asked
[1:21:44] to the people is when he shows himself
[1:21:49] they're going to know that they rejected
[1:21:51] something that was really the truth
[1:21:54] is that right
[1:21:58] ma it's going to be a quite the day
[1:22:00] isn't it
[1:22:02] it's going to be quite today i
[1:22:05] many times have imagined what judgment
[1:22:08] is going to be like
[1:22:15] you know the bible says that jesus when
[1:22:18] he died went to
[1:22:20] hell he went to the regions of the lost
[1:22:23] and preached to those souls that were in
[1:22:25] prison
[1:22:27] isn't that right he preached to those
[1:22:30] souls that were in prison
[1:22:33] and they rejected him in the days of
[1:22:35] noah everything that noah said
[1:22:38] when jesus went down and showed himself
[1:22:40] i am the son of god
[1:22:42] i am the one that you turn down here i
[1:22:44] am turn me down now
[1:22:48] you can't deny it their hearts will melt
[1:22:52] they'll be ashamed how many knows you
[1:22:55] people can
[1:22:55] deny there's a god they can reject god
[1:22:57] all they want to but this is what i
[1:22:59] imagined that if i could have a voice
[1:23:01] that i could tell to the whole world
[1:23:05] this morning brother jeff if i could
[1:23:06] tell the whole world this morning
[1:23:08] you can put him out of your schools you
[1:23:10] can imagine that we came from monkeys
[1:23:12] instead of god created
[1:23:14] we can do all of that you can you know
[1:23:17] say that there is no god
[1:23:19] but i just wanted one thing and that is
[1:23:22] that according to the bible all right
[1:23:25] according to the bible
[1:23:27] there will come a day when you're going
[1:23:29] to look at him
[1:23:31] you will look at him someday
[1:23:34] yeah you have your time now you reject
[1:23:36] all you want to now
[1:23:37] you turn your face now you say away with
[1:23:40] him away with him
[1:23:41] you say now if thou be the son of god
[1:23:44] when i see when you see me there
[1:23:46] those that pierce me you won't be able
[1:23:48] to say if thou be the son of god
[1:23:50] they'll know he was the son of god
[1:23:56] no i didn't come off the cross to prove
[1:23:58] to you that i was god because you should
[1:24:00] have believed that when lazarus
[1:24:02] rose from the dead you should have
[1:24:05] believed it when our eyes of the blind
[1:24:07] were healed and so forth
[1:24:08] that's when you should have believed but
[1:24:09] you didn't but here's your chance
[1:24:12] you get to see me again huh
[1:24:15] even those who pierced him shall look
[1:24:18] upon me
[1:24:20] all the kindreds of the world shall see
[1:24:23] me
[1:24:24] see if god isn't just going to have a
[1:24:26] little private judgment somewhere
[1:24:28] he's not just going to you know condemn
[1:24:30] them no they're all going to have to
[1:24:31] stand face to face how many knows
[1:24:33] they're going to stand
[1:24:34] before him they're all going to get the
[1:24:37] opportunity
[1:24:38] to see him how many beliefs this morning
[1:24:41] we come to the house of god and by faith
[1:24:44] we stand before him
[1:24:46] we stand before him this morning you sit
[1:24:48] before him this morning
[1:24:50] he is here now because how many know
[1:24:52] that judgment begins at the house of god
[1:24:56] this is where judgment starts this is
[1:24:59] where we come to judge ourselves
[1:25:00] and ask for his mercy amen
[1:25:05] and that's why the first part of this it
[1:25:08] talks about that is
[1:25:09] wash this from my blood and you made us
[1:25:11] kings and priests unto god because we
[1:25:13] accepted you
[1:25:14] but this class they rejected him
[1:25:18] let's look at about four five scriptures
[1:25:21] this morning can i take my time
[1:25:22] look at what happens with those who
[1:25:25] reject
[1:25:26] almighty god reject the cross
[1:25:29] those who have pierced him those who
[1:25:30] don't believe him they'll all believe
[1:25:32] can we say they'll all believe one day
[1:25:36] but see god is god is
[1:25:40] wanting humanity to have a little faith
[1:25:44] he wants us to believe even though we
[1:25:46] can't see
[1:25:48] even thomas had to see is that right
[1:25:53] amen i like that song uh how many has
[1:25:56] heard it
[1:25:58] uh thomas i am a man
[1:26:02] thomas i am a man look at my hands and
[1:26:05] look at my feet i am a man thomas i am a
[1:26:08] man well
[1:26:08] he wouldn't believe it until he saw it
[1:26:12] amen but listen so
[1:26:15] the second part of this it talks about
[1:26:17] all the kindreds of the earth shall
[1:26:19] wail because of him even so
[1:26:23] amen all the mockery
[1:26:28] is going to turn one day amen
[1:26:31] i want to go to isaiah let's go first to
[1:26:34] isaiah
[1:26:36] and i'll tie as isaiah back to the sixth
[1:26:40] seal which is in the sixth chapter of
[1:26:48] revelation
[1:26:53] okay isaiah 2 and verse 10
[1:26:57] enter into the rock and hide thee in the
[1:27:01] dust
[1:27:02] for fear of the lord
[1:27:07] amen go in rocks and caves and
[1:27:10] so forth for fear of the lord and for
[1:27:13] the glory of his majesty
[1:27:15] the lofty looks of man shall be humbled
[1:27:19] and the haughtiness of man shall be
[1:27:22] bowed down
[1:27:24] and the lord alone shall be exalted in
[1:27:27] that day
[1:27:29] for the day of the lord of hosts comes
[1:27:32] that
[1:27:33] shall be upon everyone that is proud and
[1:27:36] lofty
[1:27:39] and upon everyone that is lifted up he
[1:27:42] shall be brought low
[1:27:45] and upon all the cedars of lebanon and
[1:27:47] the high places lifted up
[1:27:49] upon the observation and upon all the
[1:27:51] high mountains and upon the hills that
[1:27:53] are lifted up
[1:27:54] and upon every high tower and upon every
[1:27:56] fence wall
[1:27:58] and upon the ships of tarshish and upon
[1:28:01] the place
[1:28:02] pleasant pictures verse 17
[1:28:05] the loftiness of man shall be bowed down
[1:28:07] and the hardiness of man shall be made
[1:28:09] low
[1:28:10] and the lord alone shall be exalted in
[1:28:12] that day
[1:28:14] and the idol shall idol shall he utterly
[1:28:18] abolish and they shall go into the holes
[1:28:22] of the rocks and into the caves
[1:28:25] of the earth for fear of the lord
[1:28:29] and for the glory of his majesty
[1:28:32] when he arises to shake terribly
[1:28:36] the earth
[1:28:40] reminds me of how brother bam said that
[1:28:42] he was over i believe he was in
[1:28:43] california one time when
[1:28:44] the pasture fell off the wall and it was
[1:28:46] such a horrible feeling
[1:28:49] each and every one of us can only
[1:28:50] imagine if this morning this
[1:28:52] building would begin to shake and rock
[1:28:55] if the plaster would begin to fall and
[1:28:57] crack open
[1:28:58] and the feeling perhaps you can only
[1:29:00] imagine of the feeling that it would be
[1:29:03] and how we would try to get out those
[1:29:05] doors
[1:29:07] as quickly as possible isn't that right
[1:29:09] and you can only imagine how you'd feel
[1:29:10] but if it happened you could really feel
[1:29:12] it but the brandon was feeling that he
[1:29:13] said it was a terrible feeling
[1:29:15] and yet one man had the audacity to go
[1:29:18] out into the streets
[1:29:20] and say something i figured just what it
[1:29:21] was he said can somebody remember what
[1:29:23] that man said
[1:29:25] some of i think it was he put his hand
[1:29:29] in the fist
[1:29:33] and look here it talks about here that
[1:29:35] people will go into the holes in the
[1:29:37] dens of the rocks
[1:29:38] and so forth for fear of him when he
[1:29:42] rises and the earth
[1:29:43] begins to shake i can just imagine that
[1:29:46] can you when
[1:29:47] california goes down brother brown said
[1:29:49] it'll shake the whole world when that
[1:29:52] goes down and when it hits the bottom
[1:29:54] amen i'm here to tell you
[1:29:59] right now according to the scriptures
[1:30:01] people will get religious
[1:30:04] people will begin to believe in god
[1:30:07] why because if they even go in there to
[1:30:09] hide us from his faith they know they
[1:30:11] got it coming
[1:30:13] i really don't think man is as dumb as
[1:30:15] they act
[1:30:17] they're not as ignorant of god as the
[1:30:19] act because when these things come even
[1:30:21] the bible says
[1:30:22] that they will hide they will try to
[1:30:24] hide from the face of them
[1:30:27] god amen
[1:30:31] okay chapter 13 again
[1:30:34] verse 6 isaiah 13 6
[1:30:38] how ye for the day of the lord is at
[1:30:41] hand
[1:30:41] now how many knows that the day of the
[1:30:43] lord is the tribulation period
[1:30:48] amen i'll show you this is man's day
[1:30:50] brother bram says but when the lord
[1:30:52] raises he's going to have his day
[1:30:54] and it's going to be his time all right
[1:30:56] y'all had your time he's going to say
[1:30:58] all right
[1:30:59] humanity you had your time now is my
[1:31:02] time
[1:31:03] this is the day of the lord the day of
[1:31:06] the lord is going to be
[1:31:07] very fierce full of wrath and judgment
[1:31:12] the day of the lord is at hand and it
[1:31:14] shall come as
[1:31:15] a destruction from the almighty
[1:31:18] therefore shall all hands
[1:31:20] be faint and every man's heart
[1:31:23] shall melt
[1:31:28] pray calling on god
[1:31:31] but it'd be too late then how many
[1:31:33] beliefs
[1:31:35] well we're in prosperity well
[1:31:37] everybody's got plenty of money
[1:31:38] well everybody's driving a nice cadillac
[1:31:40] or a nice car nice this
[1:31:42] have a nice house while we have our
[1:31:45] needs met
[1:31:47] eating our vanilla ice cream eating our
[1:31:50] oreo cookies
[1:31:52] having it all pretty nice hello how many
[1:31:54] knows we all got it nice
[1:31:56] this is the time when you've got to look
[1:31:59] somewhere else
[1:32:00] this is where you better look at a
[1:32:02] higher place and not get sucked in from
[1:32:04] all these delicacies
[1:32:05] that the devil has to offer that he's
[1:32:08] offering the world and the people are
[1:32:09] getting so caught up in it
[1:32:11] until they are spiritually in poverty
[1:32:14] amen this is the time amen when the
[1:32:17] devil offers everything that is to be
[1:32:19] offered for us to praise god
[1:32:21] and serve him like never before and to
[1:32:23] open up our hearts to god and say god
[1:32:25] here i am
[1:32:26] search my heart
[1:32:30] because i'll get to it after a while
[1:32:32] last thing i want you to imagine
[1:32:34] is when he comes when you see jesus
[1:32:38] face to face amen
[1:32:42] okay so he says every man's heart shall
[1:32:46] melt
[1:32:47] and they shall be afraid pangs
[1:32:51] of sorrow shall take hold on them
[1:32:57] they shall be in pain as a woman that
[1:33:00] travaileth
[1:33:01] they shall be amazed one at another
[1:33:04] and their faces shall be as flames
[1:33:10] i don't know just what that means but
[1:33:12] usually when you bluff or you're really
[1:33:14] ashamed of something
[1:33:16] amen your face turns red behold the day
[1:33:19] cometh
[1:33:20] the day of the lord cometh both
[1:33:24] cruel cruel both with wrath
[1:33:28] and fierce anger
[1:33:32] to lay the land desolate and he shall
[1:33:35] destroy
[1:33:36] the sinners thereof out of it
[1:33:40] for the stars of heaven and the
[1:33:41] consolations thereof shall not give
[1:33:43] their light
[1:33:44] the sun shall be darkened in his going
[1:33:46] forth and the moon shall not cause her
[1:33:48] light
[1:33:49] to shine but that will get people's
[1:33:52] attention won't it
[1:33:54] when it gets pitch black and stays like
[1:33:55] that for a while
[1:33:57] how many knows it happened what three
[1:33:58] days was it when jesus died
[1:34:01] for a good period of time it completely
[1:34:03] blacked out
[1:34:05] the sun refused to shine
[1:34:09] when the god of heaven made the
[1:34:10] sacrifice for all humanity
[1:34:13] amen
[1:34:16] man is so stubborn
[1:34:21] god show all the signs and the wonders
[1:34:23] and they steal
[1:34:24] won't adhere still won't bow
[1:34:29] still won't realize that they were
[1:34:30] created by a man by a god-man
[1:34:34] almighty god that he's there refused to
[1:34:38] acknowledge
[1:34:40] can we say something this morning people
[1:34:42] that go to hell are gonna deserve it
[1:34:46] they're gonna deserve it god wouldn't
[1:34:48] send the man to hell that didn't deserve
[1:34:50] it
[1:34:52] given every opportunity to get every
[1:34:54] chance
[1:34:55] to believe on god in this generation
[1:34:59] more than
[1:34:59] ever america more than ever because he
[1:35:02] had his last
[1:35:03] great prophet to come right out of
[1:35:07] kentucky isn't that right and then for
[1:35:10] us to turn him down with
[1:35:12] millions and millions of infallible
[1:35:14] proofs
[1:35:16] brother bam said the things that
[1:35:17] happened that he never even told about
[1:35:19] he says if he was to write
[1:35:21] books about it there wouldn't be enough
[1:35:22] parchment
[1:35:24] hardly to tell the stories of what god
[1:35:26] did in this generation
[1:35:29] and still man's heart is just so hard
[1:35:32] they actually
[1:35:33] went the wrong direction says we don't
[1:35:35] even come from god
[1:35:36] there is no god
[1:35:40] can you imagine the people how many
[1:35:41] knows everybody's going to give an
[1:35:43] account
[1:35:44] for every word to say people say there
[1:35:46] ain't no god god's going to look in the
[1:35:47] face saying i understand you said
[1:35:49] that i wasn't
[1:35:54] am i yes god you are
[1:35:58] the bible says every knee shall bow and
[1:36:01] every tongue
[1:36:02] shall confess
[1:36:07] what a day that's common folks what a
[1:36:10] day that's right ahead of us
[1:36:16] it's going to be cruel and wrath fierce
[1:36:19] anger
[1:36:20] to lay the land desolate stars will be
[1:36:23] dark and the moon shall not cause to
[1:36:25] give her a lot and i will punish the
[1:36:26] world for their evil
[1:36:28] and the wicked for their iniquity and i
[1:36:30] will cause the arrogancy
[1:36:32] huh arrogant yeah
[1:36:35] their arrogance they'll get a reward for
[1:36:39] their arrogance
[1:36:42] of the proud shall cease
[1:36:47] and i will lay low the haughtiness
[1:36:50] of the terrible i will make a man more
[1:36:53] precious than fine gold
[1:36:55] even man than the golden wedge of no far
[1:36:58] therefore i will shake the heavens
[1:37:00] and the earth shall re move out of her
[1:37:03] place
[1:37:04] in the wrath of the lord
[1:37:08] of hosts in the day of his fierce
[1:37:12] anger
[1:37:17] see how that compares with the sixth
[1:37:19] seal
[1:37:21] everybody's familiar with the sixth seal
[1:37:23] right
[1:37:24] after the fourth seal the bride is taken
[1:37:27] up after the fourth seal
[1:37:29] the fifth seal was souls under the altar
[1:37:32] and that right
[1:37:33] speaking of the jews the hitler and
[1:37:34] eichmann all those souls that were under
[1:37:36] the altar
[1:37:37] but when the sixth seal breaks loose
[1:37:39] hello
[1:37:40] upon the earth it says in chapter 6 of
[1:37:44] revelations verse 12 and i beheld
[1:37:46] when he opened the sixth seal and lo
[1:37:50] there was a great earthquake and the
[1:37:52] earth and the sun became
[1:37:54] black as sackcloth of hair and the moon
[1:37:58] became his blood and the stars of heaven
[1:38:01] fell onto the earth even as a fig tree
[1:38:03] cast as her untimely figs
[1:38:05] when she is shaken of a mighty wind and
[1:38:08] the heaven departed as
[1:38:10] a scroll when it is rolled together
[1:38:13] and every mountain and island were moved
[1:38:16] out of their places
[1:38:18] shake terribly the earth
[1:38:21] hawaii jamaica
[1:38:25] all the islands
[1:38:29] are out of their place think about it
[1:38:33] and the kings of the earth the great men
[1:38:36] the rich men
[1:38:37] the chief captains all the haughty
[1:38:41] huh the mighty men and every bond men
[1:38:46] every free man hid themselves in the
[1:38:48] dens
[1:38:50] and in the rocks of the mountains and
[1:38:52] said to the mountains city rocks
[1:38:55] fall on us and hide us from the face of
[1:38:58] him that seth on the throne
[1:39:00] and from the wrath of the lamb
[1:39:03] for the great day of his wrath is come
[1:39:06] and who
[1:39:07] shall be able to stand
[1:39:10] now can you imagine that
[1:39:14] the earth's shaking california going
[1:39:17] down
[1:39:17] mountains out of their place it's
[1:39:19] shaking it's rocking
[1:39:21] sun going down in the middle of the day
[1:39:23] stars falling
[1:39:26] it'll get their attention won't it this
[1:39:28] is just before they get to see him
[1:39:31] but every eye shall see him
[1:39:36] all the kindreds of the earth shall wail
[1:39:38] because of him
[1:39:39] how many knows the bible talks about he
[1:39:40] says you know that if you didn't make it
[1:39:42] to the wedding supper and if you were
[1:39:44] unprofitable servant casts him into
[1:39:46] outer darkness
[1:39:47] but everyone says that's into the
[1:39:49] tribulation spirit they'll be weeping
[1:39:51] and wailing weeping and wailing
[1:39:57] i can i don't know you can only describe
[1:40:00] i only noticed
[1:40:01] how to describe whaling maybe because
[1:40:05] one of the best illustrations would be
[1:40:07] at a funeral of somebody that's lost a
[1:40:09] loved one
[1:40:10] and is just overbearing
[1:40:14] the loss of their loved one
[1:40:19] even brother
[1:40:23] he said within so many years you know
[1:40:24] you lose your spouse
[1:40:26] it's it's something that only
[1:40:30] only you can understand he says but when
[1:40:32] he lost his wife he
[1:40:33] realized he didn't know nothing
[1:40:36] isn't that right brother david he really
[1:40:38] didn't realize how bad it was
[1:40:41] not only those who've lost the spouse
[1:40:42] can really understand the emptiness the
[1:40:45] loneliness
[1:40:46] the pain amen and it would be worse and
[1:40:50] it would be twice as bad if you knew
[1:40:52] didn't know for sure about where your
[1:40:53] loved one went knowing where your loved
[1:40:56] one then
[1:40:57] it doesn't make you have to sour like it
[1:40:59] does for a person that maybe
[1:41:00] thinks he'll never ever see him again
[1:41:03] but they're weak they're well they're
[1:41:05] just
[1:41:05] beyond it's just unbearable grief
[1:41:09] sometimes they have to watch people like
[1:41:11] that they don't kill themselves
[1:41:13] amen brother branham did he had such
[1:41:16] grief and pain until he put a gun that
[1:41:17] he said he couldn't take it no more it
[1:41:19] was so terrible
[1:41:20] well you compare that with wailing you
[1:41:22] talk about wailing you talk about that's
[1:41:24] what's going to be going on
[1:41:26] in the tribulation there's going to be
[1:41:27] weeping and wailing and jesus said
[1:41:29] all the kindreds of the earth they are
[1:41:31] going to wail
[1:41:33] because of him there's going to be some
[1:41:36] wailing going on when jesus comes
[1:41:39] when jesus leaves that mercy seat how
[1:41:41] many knows when he leaves that mercy
[1:41:42] seat
[1:41:43] when the last one is saved when the last
[1:41:45] one comes he leaves that mercy seat
[1:41:47] and there's no more mercy the blood is
[1:41:50] taken from the earth isn't that right
[1:41:52] and god looks down at the sin and he
[1:41:53] says this can't be in my presence
[1:41:58] i cannot dissin i don't live with sin
[1:42:02] in my universe the only thing that's
[1:42:04] covering the world
[1:42:05] and allowing them to go on right now is
[1:42:07] that circle of blood that is over the
[1:42:08] earth
[1:42:09] that brother branham saul amen
[1:42:13] that's what keeps the protection that's
[1:42:15] what keeps even the sinner protected
[1:42:17] is the blood that's what keeps you
[1:42:19] protected
[1:42:20] amen but how many of those they have to
[1:42:24] come to that place and they have to come
[1:42:25] to that judgment
[1:42:27] amen i can only imagine what jesus did
[1:42:31] brother branham illustrates it he taught
[1:42:33] times of when jesus went down to the
[1:42:34] regions of the law
[1:42:36] and preached to the souls that were in
[1:42:38] prison how many knows that when
[1:42:40] a synod dies they go to somewhere to a
[1:42:42] prison house
[1:42:46] i have a scripture on that i'm not sure
[1:42:48] just where it was but somewhere in
[1:42:49] isaiah it talks about
[1:42:50] it talks about that if the ungodly did
[1:42:52] go like into a prison house and jesus
[1:42:54] went down there
[1:42:55] and he said that he preached to those
[1:42:57] folks those p those people got to listen
[1:42:59] to a preacher whether they wanted to or
[1:43:01] not
[1:43:03] and that's how it's going to be with
[1:43:05] everybody
[1:43:07] you might want to deny you might not
[1:43:09] want to be preached to but jesus is
[1:43:10] going to preach to you sometime
[1:43:12] he's going to ask him why didn't you
[1:43:14] accept i what i did
[1:43:16] here it is you heard the preachers ah
[1:43:19] them low life preachers just out of the
[1:43:21] other go ahead say what you want
[1:43:23] but ain't nothing but telling you the
[1:43:24] truth
[1:43:27] think about god what you want and i'm
[1:43:28] telling you one of these days
[1:43:30] they're going to stand before him and i
[1:43:32] like that he says you know he said
[1:43:33] they're revelations from the beginning
[1:43:35] of the whole thing he says
[1:43:36] all the kindreds there are going to see
[1:43:38] me they're going to look upon me
[1:43:40] they're going to stand before me amen
[1:43:44] over in revelations let's look at the
[1:43:46] judgment for just a minute
[1:43:48] all right we ain't too late let's go a
[1:43:50] little bit further shall we
[1:43:55] but that's what i imagine that's what i
[1:43:57] thought when i
[1:43:58] had that scripture come to my mind i
[1:44:00] said you know it's something that he
[1:44:02] said you know
[1:44:03] and they which pierced me
[1:44:07] they're gonna see me too
[1:44:13] i can just imagine what that's gonna be
[1:44:14] like when those folks
[1:44:17] that pierced him he said come off that
[1:44:20] cross if thou art be
[1:44:20] cry when they stand before him they'll
[1:44:23] be speechless won't they
[1:44:28] can you imagine what it'll be like
[1:44:35] they said after he was resurrected they
[1:44:38] said you know
[1:44:39] let's say that he was stolen away the
[1:44:41] story is let's make a story here
[1:44:43] and agree with the roman general and the
[1:44:45] romans there that we're going to put out
[1:44:46] a story
[1:44:47] that they came and stole his body away
[1:44:50] that he didn't really raise
[1:44:52] all of these things will be brought
[1:44:54] before him how many knows he says you're
[1:44:55] not gonna
[1:44:56] you can't no no no no you can't lie now
[1:44:59] about whether i rose or again or not now
[1:45:02] can you
[1:45:03] no because here i am
[1:45:11] no people can imagine there's no god
[1:45:14] they can imagine there's no judgment how
[1:45:16] many knows they can imagine there ain't
[1:45:18] no
[1:45:19] reward for what they do but that
[1:45:21] imagination is wrong
[1:45:24] that's wrong imagination because the
[1:45:26] truth the truth is
[1:45:29] is that there is a god there is a
[1:45:31] judgment coming
[1:45:35] and i wish the whole world could hear me
[1:45:37] this morning you can deny them all you
[1:45:39] want to but according to the scripture
[1:45:41] if it is true you're going to get your
[1:45:43] chance to stand before it
[1:45:46] and you will give an account for every
[1:45:49] thought you ever had for every deed you
[1:45:51] did
[1:45:51] and not only will you give account but
[1:45:53] you will
[1:45:54] pay you will pay for every
[1:45:58] doubt for every sin that you ever
[1:45:59] committed in a burning blazing hell
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:04] and brother bam says you can't imagine
[1:46:06] it being that bad
[1:46:13] you can't imagine hell being that bad
[1:46:21] amen so go ahead do what you want but
[1:46:23] according to the scripture and if it's
[1:46:24] true
[1:46:25] you are going to stand before him
[1:46:28] and i know it's true because i know it
[1:46:31] works
[1:46:32] i know salvation works praise the lord
[1:46:38] all right so before i read this
[1:46:43] let me read you a quote brother bam says
[1:46:45] that jesus went to the souls that were
[1:46:47] in prison
[1:46:48] in which is hell locked up until the day
[1:46:50] of judgment
[1:46:51] because you see judgment isn't now
[1:46:53] there's no burning hell right now
[1:46:55] somebody tell you there's a burning hell
[1:46:57] no not now that's wrong
[1:46:58] a judge of this earth is good it's
[1:47:02] enough never to condemn a man until he's
[1:47:04] brought before
[1:47:05] a judgment isn't that right how many
[1:47:07] knows that now you're just in the
[1:47:08] regions of the lost locked up until the
[1:47:10] judgment date
[1:47:12] all right now next one then brother bam
[1:47:14] says souls in prison now
[1:47:16] and as i saw the vision of both places
[1:47:21] he says i have by the grace of god he
[1:47:24] says and i say not this to be
[1:47:25] sacrilegious and if it's wrong god for
[1:47:27] me
[1:47:27] i believe that i have seen both places
[1:47:31] in both places i've been i've seen the
[1:47:34] redeemed
[1:47:35] and the blessed i've seen the lost and
[1:47:37] where they're at
[1:47:39] hallelujah i mean that brother brandon
[1:47:41] painted us a picture
[1:47:43] the best that he could he tried to get
[1:47:46] us to imagine what it's like over there
[1:47:48] but he said there's no words in the
[1:47:50] english vocabulary
[1:47:51] to paint you a picture to get you to
[1:47:53] really see what it's like over there
[1:47:57] so every one of us when he tells the
[1:47:59] story we probably imagine a little bit
[1:48:01] different
[1:48:02] but one day we'll know just exactly how
[1:48:04] it is
[1:48:07] so he says i've seen both i've seen the
[1:48:09] loss and where they're at
[1:48:11] that's why i stand as your brother today
[1:48:13] to warn
[1:48:15] you to flee from that downward path
[1:48:18] don't you never go down that road
[1:48:23] you've got everything to live for how
[1:48:26] many believes we've got everything to
[1:48:28] serve god for
[1:48:30] that blessed upward way where they're
[1:48:33] redeemed
[1:48:34] are in joy and peace they can't sin
[1:48:37] they can't be sorrow sorry it's just
[1:48:41] nothing there but perfect
[1:48:43] that's as much as he can actually say
[1:48:45] how many knows
[1:48:47] it's just beyond our imagination
[1:48:51] how great it is i mean i don't know
[1:48:53] about you but can you imagine
[1:48:54] never getting sick never getting old
[1:48:57] never getting a gray hair
[1:48:59] never having a funeral procession never
[1:49:01] having the
[1:49:02] level you know as good as life is
[1:49:06] it's just constantly one of our friends
[1:49:08] is dying
[1:49:09] moms are dying brothers are dying uncles
[1:49:11] are dying or somebody's getting sick or
[1:49:13] somebody
[1:49:14] getting cancer this
[1:49:17] is a pest house
[1:49:21] over there we just can't imagine what
[1:49:23] it'll be like
[1:49:27] but i don't know about you but i like to
[1:49:29] try
[1:49:30] don't you like to try i like trying to
[1:49:33] imagine
[1:49:35] our loved ones appearing huh
[1:49:39] i like to try to imagine seeing one of
[1:49:42] our loved ones appear
[1:49:46] i don't know what it'd be like would you
[1:49:48] be able to touch them
[1:49:50] i don't know if you touched them could
[1:49:52] you feel them i don't know
[1:49:54] are they just like a ghost they vanish
[1:49:56] you walk through things
[1:49:58] if you shook their hands would it go
[1:49:59] through i don't know but i know your
[1:50:01] loved ones would appear
[1:50:04] and i do know this now it comes to mind
[1:50:06] that jesus
[1:50:08] says don't touch me i haven't ascended
[1:50:10] yet am i right
[1:50:12] but i do know we'll see him now i can
[1:50:15] only imagine
[1:50:17] one of these days soon after that
[1:50:19] between 20 and 30 days
[1:50:21] you're gonna have a sweep come over your
[1:50:23] body
[1:50:25] something won't happen
[1:50:29] like a tingling i don't know like a
[1:50:32] sharp pain i don't know
[1:50:34] but god is going to change this mortal
[1:50:36] body
[1:50:39] amen and we're going to see him
[1:50:42] face to face let me finish this before i
[1:50:45] get to that
[1:50:46] listen i've seen both places
[1:50:50] i know that's an awful statement for a
[1:50:53] person to make
[1:50:54] but god being my judge i solemnly
[1:50:57] believe that i've seen both places
[1:50:59] and oh far be it for any person ever
[1:51:03] entering into the regions
[1:51:05] of the lost if you were standing with
[1:51:08] hot wires
[1:51:09] bored right through tormented in every
[1:51:12] way your fingernails pulled off
[1:51:15] tormented in any way that you can
[1:51:17] possibly imagine he said
[1:51:20] it wouldn't be as bad he's at one place
[1:51:23] it would be a pleasure
[1:51:25] compared to what hell is
[1:51:29] he says tormented in every way it'd not
[1:51:32] be like that devil torment there is in
[1:51:35] that place
[1:51:36] there could be nothing the human mind
[1:51:39] the my human mind couldn't comprehend
[1:51:42] what the reasons of the lost is there's
[1:51:45] no way to explain it
[1:51:49] and there's no way to explain the
[1:51:51] regions of the blast this
[1:51:54] oh my the one is so horrible and the
[1:51:57] other one is so great
[1:51:59] so if anybody hears me i'm getting to be
[1:52:01] an old man
[1:52:03] and as i read this i can say this
[1:52:05] morning
[1:52:06] he's not an old man anymore he's over
[1:52:10] there
[1:52:10] right now in the reasons of the blast
[1:52:15] waiting for you and me
[1:52:18] yes he is
[1:52:22] see if i drop dead tonight
[1:52:25] or today man you could repeat things
[1:52:28] that i said but i trust you could
[1:52:30] say he's not here anymore he's over
[1:52:33] there
[1:52:34] where he talked about yesterday
[1:52:38] everybody's looking forward to seeing
[1:52:40] your loved ones
[1:52:42] and i want to i want to talk about
[1:52:44] getting ready for that
[1:52:46] in closing i don't know according to
[1:52:48] nature i may not have too many years
[1:52:51] wait a minute i missed something i'm
[1:52:54] getting to be an old man
[1:52:55] i don't know how much longer i've got
[1:52:58] i'll soon be 55 years old
[1:53:00] so if you want to know if you're an old
[1:53:01] man or not there you go
[1:53:04] according to nature i may not have too
[1:53:06] many years
[1:53:08] i don't know where this tape will go but
[1:53:11] let everyone
[1:53:12] hear hearing the tape
[1:53:16] or wherever it may go don't never go
[1:53:19] down that downward
[1:53:20] path of the regions of the lost you
[1:53:23] can't picture
[1:53:24] hell being that bad
[1:53:27] and whatever you do don't you never
[1:53:29] forget this
[1:53:31] that the regions of the blessed i would
[1:53:33] say this with saint paul
[1:53:35] eyes have not seen ears have not heard
[1:53:38] neither entered into the heart of man
[1:53:41] the things that god has prepared for
[1:53:43] those
[1:53:44] that love him amen
[1:53:51] how many believes that
[1:53:54] we imagine that one of these days the
[1:53:57] lord jesus will come
[1:54:00] and he's going to do that your
[1:54:01] imagination is going to come true
[1:54:04] and when he comes and when you meet him
[1:54:11] when you talk to him when you come
[1:54:13] before him
[1:54:16] remember jesus is getting a people ready
[1:54:19] to live with him let me just say this
[1:54:24] i'll read the two scriptures and then
[1:54:27] give you this final quote okay so just
[1:54:29] try to pay attention if you can
[1:54:31] for a few more minutes
[1:54:39] in the book of jude
[1:54:44] and in the book of peter
[1:54:49] how many believes that when we come to
[1:54:50] church on sunday morning
[1:54:52] and not just sunday morning and
[1:54:55] wednesday but
[1:54:56] every day the one thing that you and i
[1:54:58] are doing
[1:54:59] is preparing ourselves for that time you
[1:55:04] want to be ready to meet him
[1:55:05] you want to be ready to see him face to
[1:55:08] face
[1:55:09] that's why we come to church we say god
[1:55:12] if there's any way in me
[1:55:14] that is none like you lord take it out
[1:55:16] because when i meet him
[1:55:18] how many believes you want to stand
[1:55:20] there before him
[1:55:22] not thinking about having sinned the day
[1:55:24] before
[1:55:25] huh or not being right
[1:55:29] huh how many knows when you come before
[1:55:31] him there's nothing going to be any
[1:55:33] you know there's no going to be no
[1:55:35] secrets everything
[1:55:37] you are it's all going to open before
[1:55:39] either you
[1:55:40] love his appearing and you're waiting
[1:55:42] for him and you can say god i have been
[1:55:44] waiting for this time
[1:55:45] for so long or this morning you're not
[1:55:48] really ready
[1:55:50] if he came this morning visibly here
[1:55:53] saying this is the rapture come with me
[1:55:55] would you be ready so in jude
[1:56:05] in jude 1 and verse
[1:56:10] 24 says now unto him that is able to
[1:56:13] keep you
[1:56:14] from falling and to present you
[1:56:18] faultless before the presence of his
[1:56:20] glory
[1:56:21] with exceeding joy
[1:56:25] to the only wise god our savior be glory
[1:56:27] and majest dominion forever and ever
[1:56:29] both now and for ever
[1:56:34] peter says it this way chapter 3 ii
[1:56:37] peter but the day of the lord will come
[1:56:39] as a thief in the night into which the
[1:56:40] heavens shall pass away
[1:56:42] with a great noise the elements shall
[1:56:44] melt with fervent heat
[1:56:45] the earth also in the works thereof
[1:56:47] there therein shall be burnt up
[1:56:50] seeing that these things shall be
[1:56:51] dissolved what manner of persons are ye
[1:56:54] to be
[1:56:55] in all holy conversation and godliness
[1:57:00] looking for huh how many is looking for
[1:57:03] it
[1:57:05] i may have an imagination of what it's
[1:57:06] like and it may be different from my
[1:57:08] imaginations but i'm looking for
[1:57:10] him he's going to come we're going to
[1:57:12] see him
[1:57:13] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[1:57:15] of the day of god
[1:57:16] wherein the heavens shall be on fire
[1:57:19] shall be dissolved
[1:57:20] and the elements shall melt with fervor
[1:57:22] and he nevertheless we
[1:57:24] notice how this is not for us that's
[1:57:26] what's going to happen to the world
[1:57:28] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:57:31] look for a new heavens and a new earth
[1:57:34] while in foreign dwelleth righteousness
[1:57:36] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[1:57:38] for such
[1:57:39] things i mean he's looking for it be
[1:57:42] diligent
[1:57:43] be very diligent this morning that you
[1:57:46] may be found
[1:57:48] in him in peace
[1:57:51] without spot
[1:57:54] and blameless so my question this
[1:57:58] morning is
[1:57:59] are all your sins under the blood
[1:58:03] are you ready to meet him are you ready
[1:58:06] when we're going to see him
[1:58:07] when you're going to see those nails
[1:58:08] scarred hands
[1:58:11] hey live brother brown says in souls in
[1:58:15] prison
[1:58:15] talk about listen to me so stop if
[1:58:18] you're listening to this hate
[1:58:20] turn the machine off even repent if
[1:58:22] you're not saved
[1:58:24] get right with god
[1:58:27] i'm saying this by firsthand experience
[1:58:29] as i believe it in my heart
[1:58:31] if the visions has deceived me god be
[1:58:33] mercy for making such a statement as
[1:58:35] that
[1:58:36] but with the sincerity of my heart
[1:58:37] knowing that not one of the visions ever
[1:58:39] failed
[1:58:40] i believe i've seen both places he says
[1:58:42] far be it from any human being ever
[1:58:44] going
[1:58:45] down that downward road now jesus after
[1:58:49] he finished his
[1:58:50] ministry preached to the souls that were
[1:58:53] unsavable
[1:58:54] that could never be saved now the bible
[1:58:57] tells us that he went and preached the
[1:58:59] souls that were in prison that repented
[1:59:01] not when mercy was given to them
[1:59:04] they spurned mercy and now
[1:59:07] they're waiting for the judgment
[1:59:10] amen waiting for that time when god's
[1:59:13] going to show him his hands
[1:59:14] they're going to see him they're waiting
[1:59:16] for that time then he says oh what a
[1:59:18] time that must have been oh i wish
[1:59:20] there was some way that i could shake
[1:59:22] the world with that
[1:59:24] with that to let them know what the
[1:59:26] reality
[1:59:28] of it is amen
[1:59:36] the song goes i can only imagine
[1:59:39] what it will be like when i walk
[1:59:43] by your side i can only imagine what my
[1:59:46] eyes will see
[1:59:47] when your face is before me
[1:59:51] i can only imagine i can only imagine
[1:59:55] to be surrounded by your glory
[1:59:59] what will my heart feel will i dance for
[2:00:01] you jesus
[2:00:03] or in all of you be still
[2:00:08] will i stand in your presence or to my
[2:00:11] knees will i fall
[2:00:13] will i sing hallelujah or will i be able
[2:00:16] to speak at all
[2:00:18] i can only imagine i can only imagine
[2:00:21] i can only imagine when that day comes
[2:00:24] when i find myself
[2:00:26] standing in the sun i can only imagine
[2:00:30] when all i will ever do is forever
[2:00:34] forever worship you i like that
