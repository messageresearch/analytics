giving him good health and just pray that god will continue to watch over him and we have a couple of prayer requests tonight we'll take the lord in prayer and uh jan's not here we've been going through quite a struggle with her over her wound on her leg and they finally told her the other day that they tried to admit it in the hospital last thursday and we'd plan to go out of town for our anniversary and just told him she didn't want to do that so she has to go to the doctor tomorrow and they're going to run some tests and so i don't know what they're going to do with that she's retaining too much fluid so just remember her she's been in a lot of pain and just pray that god will just work out worker worker grace in her life and she she doesn't keep her leg up she's pretty miserable and it gets to hurting quite a bit so just remember heard in your prayers and just pray that god just just give her a miracle she needs one in her body tonight and i just pray that i i woke up this morning and she wasn't in bed she gets up and down and i was thinking as brother brad i i began to think the other day when brother brad preached the mother's day message and uh he began to talk about how mothers are always busy and i was always amazed whenever the kids were growing up because there's always you mothers know there's always a mountain of laundry and we would go to bed and she'd be doing laundry when we'd get up she'd be doing laundry and i said when did you come to bed she said i slept for a while i don't know how long that wild was but she was always busy and so just remember her in prayer gotta just touch her body and if you have any on your heart you might let me know with uplifted hand and man sister peggy in the different shut-ins tonight and hey man we're gonna ask for the brian if he'd open the service in the word of prayer tonight spoken amen let's sing that little course i was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the lord tonight well i was glad when they said unto me oh i was glad when they said unto me i was glad when they said unto me oh let us go to the house [Applause] in the house of the lord for they'll be singing in the house of the lord oh let us go to the house they'll be preaching tonight where they'll be preaching in the house of the lord [Music] they'll be preaching in the house of the lord or they'll be preaching in the house of the lord oh let us go to the house i was glad once again well i was glad to me oh i was glad when they said unto me oh i was glad when they said unto me oh let us go to the house this would be good for all of us tonight where they'll be shouting [Applause] [Music] shouting in i was glad once again tonight well i was glad when they said unto me i was glad when they said unto me oh i was glad when they said unto me [Music] amen tonight amen amen god bless you you may be seated tonight and amen i we sing that little of course that one verse they'll be shouting and i know some people don't think we should get really excited but you know i guess one of my favorite quotes by the brad of brother brandon's is when he talks about that man of course i'm kind of like yeah i like baseball so he got so beside himself he grabbed his straw hat and just yanked it down over his head because he was enthused and you know i don't i don't know what you like to do but there's nothing i like better more than to be in the presence of the lord jesus i've been to baseball games and went home sad because i paid a lot of money and my team lost and i went home happy because they did win but there's nothing like the joy and the thrill the feel the lord jesus christ and to be in his presence and it's not always shouting sometimes just to lift your hands and feel that sweet holy spirit just it just moves it it just feels like a i don't know how to describe it but you know what i'm talking about and i just pray as brother daniel williams used to say if you just need to stand in the corner and shake your head yes if that's what you do let the lord have his way in your heart and life tonight and this song was on my heart today and it's in the red book sister becky page 139 at calvary and amen we wouldn't be here tonight if it wasn't for calvary and i'm so thankful for what the lord's done for us and i have the privilege i want to give a little testimony before we sing and i get to work for myself and the lord's blessed us when we go out and buy cars and i was at a young he's probably about 30 years old a black man the other day and we were talking and i began to testify to him and began to tell him what the lord had done for me and all the things he had brought me through and and uh he looked at me and he said you know he said the last two days has been the worst two days that i can remember he got hurt on his job and he couldn't no longer do what he used to do he said i went from making 80 000 a year 70 to 80 000 a year to making 20 000 a year because i hurt my back and i said well i'm gonna tell you i said you trust in the lord and put your hope in him because that's the only hope that we have and i said i know by experience firsthand that god not only will he bless you spiritually he'll do he'll bless you financially and he'll he can touch your body he'll do whatever you had need of and he looked at me and he said i'm glad that you came by today and i said lord sometimes we go through trials and we go through tests and we don't understand it's all because of calvary and what you've done for us that we can help somebody you say will he ever come to lord i don't know but i know one thing god is able to save him tonight and to help him amen well years i spin in vanity and pride [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] there

this is certainly going to be i guess well i won't say that i preached it before but it'll be a different direction than we've preached before amen and most likely this evening it'll probably affect everybody amen amen shouldn't be anybody left out on this one so amen because i know i wasn't amen and i was like wow lord that is really something because even whenever i got whenever this message kind of come to me i was like wow that's really good so praise the lord so if you will open your bibles to the book of revelation and this evening we want to talk about dishonesty and honesty amen all right it's quite a subject isn't it we want to focus focus with the help of the lord on honesty but of course we'll bring in the opposite also in revelation 21 and there's two places here that he kind of sounds a lot alike so we're going to read read both of those scriptures let's go to revelations 22 12 through 15 first blessed did i say 12-15 let's go uh yeah let's go 12-15 that's what i got mark revelations 22 verse 12. and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are dated to his commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates of the city for without are dogs and sorcerers whoremongers and murderers idolaters and what's or whosoever loveth and maketh a lie isn't it something that god would put that in the very end whoever loveth or maketh a lie amen well let me know just something that comes to me before we read the other word uh a lie has to be made am i right you have to make a lie you know because you have to pervert truth in order to make a lie amen so you actually have to make a lie you have to take the truth and pervert it in order to make a lie amen in verse chapter 21 verse six through eight and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and the omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son amen him that overcometh but the fearful and the unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death may god had his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen we want to talk about uh talk about honesty dishonesty amen first of all we know that something that's dishonest is a lie it's not the truth isn't that right something that's honest something that's right is truth amen and honesty is a form of holiness right we know this because many times when somebody is needing to confess something or whatever you know we'll tell them look why don't you just tell me the truth we say it this way why don't you come clean why don't you come clean and tell the truth why because even the man even the reason that we have the story of the prospector uh that went and found gold and was on his way back and you know he was in his cabin and his dog kept barking in the kit barking and he finally shot his dog because he wouldn't quit barking and he shot his dog and afterwards man went in there and killed the man the reason that we know that is because that man came clean because he had that is on his conscience all of his life and brother bam said that at his death deathbed is when he confessed it in other words he wanted to get it off his chest so he actually confessed to the murder and that's how he found out what the story all was about because he confessed it amen because confession amen and this is another word for confession is very very important thing because confession is to the truth right if thou shalt confess with our mouth the lord jesus why why do you have to confess the lord jesus because jesus said i am the way i am the truth somebody knows that this is the truth the bible is the truth everything outside of that is dishonesty it's a lie let every man's word by and mind the truth is what god says amen and ultimately there's only two things that we can do there's only two things we have to either accept honesty or dishonesty we have to accept the truth or we accept a lie amen and we know the very beginning of the creation the very beginning of the fall was because that eve did what she believed a lie and she believed the lie she didn't stay with the truth amen and that's what caused the whole thing it brought death to the whole human race because she went with dishonesty right she believed something that was not honest that was not true she believed the lie believed something that was dishonest and it brought the whole thing in and in his end time the prophet of god said that it was actually the churches out there hello they also have accepted the devil's lie isn't that right they also accepted the devil's eye and brought all brought us to where we are now politically nationally the whole thing they brought it to death because they believed a lie over the vindicated word of god amen let me tell you something i want to talk a little bit about being honest with god being honest with yourself and being honest with others amen and it's all because this all derived from a little revelation as i was listening to the prophet of god and and thought about a certain story and so forth that he mentioned and he mentions a woman that comes back from heaven and when she comes back from heaven she confesses something all right and it is the smallest thing that you might think that would be so small so little so insignificant but yet to come back from heaven and to confess something amen and i thought it back and i thought about how that i thought about calling this honesty from heaven or heavenly honesty amen praise the lord because ultimately brothers sisters we have to be honest and we have to be honest with god now how many knows that the bible says over in let me just find it here if i can first of all in second corinthians fourth chapter one through two it says therefore seeing that we have this ministry as we have received mercy we thank not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty amen everything that's not true amen not walking and crafting us don't handling the word of god deceitfully amen i mean as you can tell when somebody's misleading you amen a salesman plenty can make it much better than it is misleading you can hear when it's but don't walk crafty and craftiness but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god amen all right romans also in romans the 14th chapter and this is found also back i'm going to read isaiah right quick isaiah 45 and 23 says it this way i have sworn by myself the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear paul repeats this and he says for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god now he knows that every tongue another place he talks about every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord amen that he is lord every time every knee all of our politicians everybody will bow the knee every tongue is going to have to confess yes you are lord and remember in isaiah and here he says my word has gone forth and shall not return void every knee will bow every tongue shall confess amen that this is the truth amen that his word is the truth so eventually people have to confess to the truth amen sooner or later now let me tell you something else excuses are just a lie there's just a way of trying to get around something but it's a lie not even the truth and people make all kinds of excuses people will say that they don't believe in god but yet the bible says that even the devils believe right even the devil believes and trembles in romans the first chapter in verse 20 it says for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seeing being understood by the things that are made even is he in godhead so that they are without excuse when i was studying this i began to think of how that you know god says that a man says there's no god is a fool but you know he is a fool but he didn't call him dumb he didn't call him stupid huh not dumb not ignorant you can look at the creation and you can know there's got to be a god all right if you choose to try to believe that there isn't one you're not dumb you're a fool you already know but you're just making the fool of yourself amen because here the bible clearly states that just by the things that are made people can know that there's a god let me bring this again to even serpentine even the devil and people that are absolutely of the devil they also believe in a god i mean those that everybody believes in some kind of god they believe there's a god out the indians did africa all of them they all believed that there's a god because the their daddy their great great great great great granddad he believed that there was a god and he had a temple and he worshipped and he brought fruits and he sacrificed to god and his name was cain am i right oh he was a very religious man amen but if you'll notice like i said you either have to accept the truth or you have to accept something that's not the truth something that sits on forever it's either all about honesty or it's about dishonesty amen and you have to be honest with god and believe people that are not honest with god well you better watch them they're not going to be honest with themselves they're not going to be honest with you they're not going to be honest they're not honest because if everybody was honest what would they do they would all believe what god said because the bible over say first or second john says if you do not believe the witness of god you have made him a liar in other words you say that ain't true you're making him a liar he says my word is true you say no it's not you're making him a liar hello you're trying to say it's not the truth but if everybody if everybody looked at it right and gave honor to god the way he's supposed to be honored is that right and if they all would do what they're supposed to do they would know that this is the truth if they were what honest with themselves people are not honest with their self and they're not honest with god the sad part what the sad part once they are confronted with the truth once the truth comes in front of you is that right it's presented to you the truth is then you either have to accept that truth or you have to accept a lie and let me tell you something isn't that what the world has done the world has done just that according to second thessalonians and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after satan after working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish all right because they receive not the love of the truth amen they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved because how many knows that if you received the truth of god it'll save you if you accept what god has said it'll actually save your soul amen because it's going to be filled with people who have accepted a lie and therefore it makes them liars amen and heaven is going to be full of people who were honest honest for this cost notice that they might be saved for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness folks there will be people that are deacons that are preachers that are evangelists take people like benny hen you take people that know about the prophet of god and even repeat him and say things about him and stuff don't tell me they don't know no they'll give the given account over there for that that's right everybody and really truthfully how many knows that god is responsible to bring the truth to front of everybody the truth has to be presented to people for them to be accountable you know right and then they have to make a choice of whether or not they accept the truth or a lie and on the day of judgment folks it'll be played back their very thoughts will be played back there's one thing sure folks that you can hide it you can you can look be connected you can do it all that but it'll all be brought out over there there isn't nothing that isn't going to be revealed over there that's why he says he comes his reward is with him to give to every man according to his work that right everybody's going to be you know given a given basically on whether they chose to accept the truth or whether they accepted a dishonest lie that's where it all lays right there wow that's something in it look at the pharisees isn't that right look at the pharisees now jesus brought him the truth didn't he but he they just wouldn't hear him they didn't want to hear him because of pride because of jealousy but when nicodemus came to jesus at night what did he say he said i know that you are a a are of god did he say it that way now what do you say sister begging that's right we secret word we pharisees know that you're a man of god but they were afraid to confess him they didn't want to confess him their pride in their prestige and all of that so what did that make him that made them to accept the devil's lie in their minds amen ah you were not born of fornication all that was just throw off because they knew in their heart nobody could do that without them being a god now you take that when jesus raised him from the dead lashes from the dead open the eyes of the blind all these things you bring that into our age hello and all the miracles that are done that have been done through the ministry of the prophet of god jesus christ would come down in the after by almost every sermon that right and show himself this generation this world is without excuse and buddy i'm gonna hear that i'll tell you right now you are lying to yourself if you don't believe that those tapes are gonna meet you on judgment day because brother man said this message will meet this generation on the judgment day don't give me no excuses you heard it you knew it and you accepted something that was a lie a dishonesty over the word of god and many penteco preachers and churches baptist methodists and all of them hello will be thrown out many will come to me in that day say lord lord open to us no he says haven't we spoke in tongues haven't we cast out there have we done many mighty works in your name and jesus will say depart from me i never knew you you workers of what iniquity is order to do something and not do it they chose to go the other way you choose dishonesty over honesty when the word and the truth is come before you and you seal your doom thereby or you get saved by there by thereby how many is glad to be a product of having faith and belief in it the unbelieving is the one that's going to go over there they don't choose to believe they don't want to believe cain had an opportunity to believe that he was right there in front of him and presented him he willfully walked the other way for that they will give an account amen the world will give an account people will the religious world will give an account amen because they chose to believe a lie amen they received not the love of the truth so god what does he do you take a simple thing like there was never nobody baptized in titles of father son the holy ghost oh my only in the name of jesus christ was anybody ever baptized you hear that and then what you do with that can determine your outcome because the proof of truth is right there in front of you you have to choose one or the other amen all the way down it doesn't matter what it is each one and every every part of it you have to choose whether you'll receive it or whether you would rather believe a lie but they had pleasure and unrighteousness people have pleasure in their unrighteousness how could they brother but i can't understand how pentecostal preachers and all them over in arizona amen told their people don't you go to brother madam's meetings or we'll excommunicate you i mean jesus is there discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart we've got the messiah signed there people are getting healed but don't you go there something terrible happened down in here folks they wouldn't want to confess to the truth but one day how many knows one day god's gonna say i told you behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord and he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the hearts of the father now why wasn't your heart turned back what is your excuse huh that's something praise the lord amen and sin comes in because of unbelief and unconfession and then sin comes it's sin to disbelief how many believes it's good to confess if we confess with our mouth the lord jesus christ we shall be saved if we accept the truth you'll be all right but the truth comes to us on a daily basis amen let me say talk about this for a minute first you have to be honest with god but people will absolutely on the second part people will absolutely deceive them bible talks about people who will deceive themselves they would rather be deceived but to be honest with god is to let the holy spirit bring a light into your life it'll bring conviction into your life it'll make you honest brother i'm talked about after getting the holy ghost you know you'll take that i tire iron or whatever tool you borrowed that's sitting there you'll want to take that back home you want everything right how many ghost makes you want to have everything right everything honest christian wants to be honest that's one of the major things is if you want happiness and joy folks you have to have a clear conscience you have to be honest with god let him come down and shine it but if you're not honest with god you don't you don't have that relationship of lord i want to be pleasing to you you know right then you go to the other side and you lie to yourself well it doesn't really matter that was the lie that eve believed from the devil was god don't really care it doesn't really matter you're not surely gonna die amen it deviates from the word of god amen so you have to be honest with god you have to be honest with yourself before you'll be honest with others amen okay let's talk about confession of our sins to be honest with ourself remember the story brother bam gave of a woman that came to him and she was i don't know just how extreme it was but she was very nervous and upset all the time always tore up just nervous wreck and brother brandon went into his life and says you know you had an affair with a man a long time ago i've made that right i've confessed that to god let me tell you something how many knows if you see that if that had been any good if that confession would have been good huh god would rather man would have never saw it but i'm here i'm telling you here when you're not honest with yourself you will bring a lot of torment upon yourself amen she wasn't honest he was honest with god but she didn't have the audacity to confess it because that's the only way to get rid of guilt is to confess to make it right amen and she wasn't really honest because she knows she'd have known that she needs to tell her husband they're right but after think about it afterwards then it could be released and let me tell you something from what i understand she had been paid for by a lot of different ministers yet she was a sunday school teaching all these other things but she was prayed for and tried to overcome that but as long as that sin that untruthfulness that dishonesty was in there the devil had a right to hold on to her to grab grabber not let go no matter how much oil was poured upon her no matter how great the evangelist was praying for her how much he prayed that devil had the right to be there how many believes as long as we are not honest in our heart we have dishonesty hid we know this isn't right in our life we know that isn't right in our life come on now the devil has a right to be there and any preacher praying for you isn't going to do any good not until you make that thing right you have to be honest amen praise be to god oh yeah the song says nothing between me me and my savior amen let nothing between praise the lord brother branham many times if the prophet of god remember whenever he uh was under the investigation of the irs and he was under immense amount of pressure and they called again and they were on the phone and she says what do you want me to tell him and he ran outside the back of the building tell him i'm not in here maybe by the time maybe by the time that he was outside he wasn't in there anymore my his wife was godly and she says you know it was that just exactly right i mean whenever you ask yourself that question you already know it isn't exactly right come on folks and so guess what he went to pray for our baby and man he was so condemned what did brother branham do he tells us that story don't he even in his life story when he tells his life story talks about not obeying god and the price that his wife paid the price that his child paid now i want to read you that story perhaps after a while here in a minute but you know even his wife told him he says you know where we made our mistake she said perhaps if you would have obeyed god things would have been different that's quite something from your lovely wife coming back to you telling you that that if you've done the right thing it would be different folks and i want to tell you something if we're honest with ourselves sometimes we have to ask ourselves just how many times we miss the holy spirit how many times we miss the speaking of the holy spirit in our lives and we barge on hello and it's never good is it lord help us sure he confessed he knew he had made a mistake even going to africa when the holy spirit don't go up into the next land stay right here and he listened to the preachers and he got home sick and he was sick for years years of sickness because of didn't listen he confessed this he made it right he wasn't afraid to do that and even the bible talks about confess your sins one to another and god will heal you but as long as you have unconfessed sin you aren't truthful you on the side not honest with yourself folks i'm here to tell you that when you get honest with yourself the holy spirit will come in and he'll show you things amen there's two times two times that people will get honest amen one of them is perhaps when sickness comes upon them they want to get something from god and they begin to clean out their closets so to speak isn't that right know what the prophet taught if you want to get here first of all go back in your life and find out if there's anything that you haven't made right if you have there's something there then go back and make it right confess that thing be honest with yourself and make it right and then folks i'm here to tell you if people aren't honest with themselves most of the time they do when they come down to their deathbed it's a little late then but it's better than never huh folks i've had people come to me and confess you know things that i'd have thought they'd never confess people never admit they're wrong never try to make it right no no all through life i'm right you're wrong i'm right and come say look i apologize all of a sudden there's no reason for the bread to be proud anymore because you're fixing to go meet the maker there's only one thing it doesn't matter how humble you have to be you'll humble yourself you'll confess you'll make it right because you don't want to go over there with unconfessed sin you don't want to go over there in dishonesty because you might be dishonest here but when you get over there you better be right amen you have to be right to be there and to go there you have because there's nothing there's no dishonesty entering heaven there's no filth there's no dirt there's no other all of that it's got to be clean how many believe we got to be clean we've got to have a clean heart without holiness no man shall see god amen all right let me see if i have my story let's talk about another there's several different ones that i want to talk about but let's talk about daniel curry brother man says here some time ago about 100 years ago there was a great christian lived in the southwest of the united states his name was daniel curry a wonderful man a godly man a sainted man a real christian a man that everybody thought so much of he was such a wonderful person and the story goes that he died you read another story you'll find out that he he went into a trance he he said that he and he went up to heaven of course when he died and when he got to the pearly gates now he didn't actually die he actually had a dream blurb said either a transfer or a dream over this this was what he had but he dreamt that he died the caretaker came to the door says who are you he says i am the evangelist daniel curry i want thousands of souls to christ i want to come home in this morning my life's journey here on earth is over and i have no place to go now but says that's the way it's coming to you so i'm warning my singer friend that's the way it's coming to you backslider that's the way it's coming to you let's grieve the holy spirit away from you them not to be gentle and tender anymore you haven't cried for years you haven't blushed for i don't know when all modest is calling from you sure but it's going to come to your door one of these mornings and as the gentle holy spirit comes and knocks why don't you just let him in so daniel curry come to the gate they went in and they said well we'll see if your name is here and they looked around they couldn't find his name said no there's no daniel courier here he says surely he said i'm an evangelist he's out for one souls of christ said i've tried to do the thing that's right the caretaker said sir i'm sorry to tell you but there's no daniel curry here said i tell you what you might do said you might have you have no rights here to take your case said but do you want to appeal your case you can appeal your case to the white throne judgment if you want to he said we we can't have mercy here for you at all because we don't have you on the book there's no mercy for you says do you want to peel your case he says sir what more can i do but to peel my case he said well then you can go to the white zone judgment appeal your case there daniel curry said that he felt himself going through space for about an hour said he come into a place he got lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter so it further went the lighter it got it was a hundred times thousand times brighter than the sun ever signs he said he was trembling and said when he got into that night he heard a voice say was you perfect on earth he said no i wasn't perfect got the trembling did you always play on us with everybody he said and he said in another place he says you know he thought that he was a pretty good man until you come into that light and he realized that he wasn't quite as honest as what he had maybe thought he was amen i mean i said that's how it is when the holy spirit comes into your heart you find out oh my i'm not as good as i thought i was that's what the holy spirit will tell you it'll show you your faults all right he said i a few things come to mind that i wasn't just exactly honest about no i guess i wasn't honest said did you tell the truth in every case in your life said no i remembered some things i told that was just a little shady i wasn't truthful just exactly said did you ever take anything that did not belong to you anything money or anything else that didn't belong to you it was giannis see said he thought on earth he was pretty good but he was condemned he says no i've took things that didn't belong to me he said then you wasn't perfect he said no i wasn't perfect so he was just looking for any time for the blast to come from that great light from where the dove rested condemned said just then he heard a voice behind him that was sweeter than any mother's voice he'd ever heard said he turned to look and the sweetest face he'd ever saw sweeter than his mother's face was standing there with him and he said now father daniel curry stood for me down on earth it's true he wasn't perfect but he stood for me he stood for me on earth now i'm going to stand for him in heaven take all of his sins and put him over on my account amen who's going to stand for you on that day brother branham says amen now i wrote this down i said i wonder what will happen with politicians when they get over there and ask you to ask a question did you ever lie i wrote down here they'll confess yes that's about all i ever did and every time my mouth was open it was a lie come on people amen it's okay you all know there's a there's hardly any more liars than that they lie lie lie i've come to the conclusion a lot of times if they tell you one thing you can know it's the exact opposite is that right but that's the truth i was going to ask him did you ever lie they'll have to be honest you're going to have to confess oh they're going to confess to their sin they're going to have to confess to all of it every bit of it amen that's why i said about church members preachers all of them was you honest was you you know did you believe my word when i sent my word to you they'll be all ask these questions they'll have to give a straight answer and it's not going to be good amen let me say this this is a story i wanted to get to and this sister that went to heaven came back and apologized it was sister hope brother branham's wife that was taken to heaven and little sharon rose because of brother branham's disobedience of not going can i read you the story i walked into the room by myself and she says i'll go with you the nurse said i said no i want to go alone i pulled the door in behind me like that i walked over there because they had called brother branham and after about six months of just really struggling and praying and trying to get sister hope to get better they finally called her and called him in and said that she was going they had a sheet over her face already this is what tells me what condition she was in i pulled that sheet back when i looked laying there there laid my darling i looked at her and she was drawn up like this i put my hand on her head and it was sticky i couldn't see any breath and i shook her and i said hope sweetheart please speak to me once to me once to me as i love you with all my heart i've always did i always will please one speak once more to me and i shook her like that and i screamed at her hope and her eyes came open those great eyes staring with death in them in another place he says those black beautiful eyes here he says with death in them just like an angel's eyes she looked at me and she started to smile she motioned me to get down and she said oh why did you call me back i said call you i said why honey have i done wrong she said no you haven't done wrong he was worried you did wrong by calling her back she said just then the nurse come running and she says river brennan you'll have to come out and she says here come here hilda he was a friend of hers and here's what made me feel she said i hope you get when you get married you have a husband like mine he's been so good to me so understanding you know how it'd make you feel and i said honey i hadn't been able to do for you like i wanted to we've had to figure out maybe to buy her a calico dress once every three or four months i said i've worked and helped me to make you've worked and helped me to make a living for the kitties and the girls started crying and she went back out of the room the nurse i said why did you tell me i'd done wrong by calling me back and she says oh bill you've preached about it honey you've talked about it but said you don't realize what it is let me just let that sink in a little bit we don't realize what the holy spirit in our hearts really is where it'll take us i heard him say yesterday he says if you you you cannot go out of this world without the holy ghost amen and expect to be over there said i was being taken home by a group of white angels said it was like an oriental thing with great big birds flying from tree to tree amen just a beautiful place brother brown described it a little more in another place i believe with all of my heart her eyes come open to see the vision she was going into paradise oh my i don't know whether you believe this or not but i've stood by the bedside and seen saints going here they've talked to their loved ones that's going on years ago you've done that i just wondered this friend how not this is not doctrine it's just a thought and i wonder if that if at that morning when death is hard anyhow he said i was standing he kind of goes on another story i was standing by the side of a man a few years ago he'd been a christian for a long time and he says he talked me said billy i said is everything all right it's mr blood blood cell he was about 80 years old said oh everything's okay really said i want to see my lord so bad my life is all worn and gone said i want to see him he's he's standing there talking to me his wife there all of a sudden he says mother why he says i haven't seen you for years billy do you see her i said no he says do you know mother mother this is oh miss blood so said honey you're said i'm not beside myself said sister she been gone for years and i just wonder if at that great hour when we're going down god knows that this soul is coming from the body like a tooth being extracted from your mouth i wonder if god don't say to mother go on down and stand by jordan your son's coming over this morning amen awesome praise the lord in our eyes when it's breaking from that natural world into the spiritual world then it becomes a visual there and we actually see them standing amen i thought she was entering paradise and i said what did it look like honey said oh it was so beautiful she said what is it honey she said i must hurry back she said i guess you know why i'm going oh that's what hurt me and i said yes she said you should have never listened to mother and i said i know it i says i know i shouldn't have listened to your mother i said honey someday i will make it up for it so help me she said bill if you have went ahead and done what god told you to do it might have been different today i said that's right but said sweetheart you couldn't help it she said you couldn't help but you were trying to be good-hearted and i said i know that honey she said that to him then so she said well you promised me something i said what is it i don't want to be a baby folks but oh when i think of what i've done to christ the wrong that i've done amen she said promise me something and i said what is it she said promise me that you will preach the same holy spirit gospel till death shall set you free see imagine that her telling him to preach that gospel because she knows that when everybody anybody that asks that holy ghost when they come to that place it's going to be a good thing how many of those christians don't die i said i promise and she said i want you to promise me something else that you'll not live single oh i said i can't thomas said honey i can't promise that she said i've got two children and said i don't want them drugged from pillar to post you find some good girl that's got the baptism of the holy ghost and you marry her so you can make a home for the kitties i said i can't promise that sweetheart i love you too well she says there will be somebody come along bill said promise me that will you and i said well i can't promise that she says don't let me go without promising she says another thing said you remember the time when you was in louisville and you wanted to buy that rifle to go hunting with i just love guns and fish and things and i was going and i was going away and she says you know that little rifle you wanted to buy and it cost three dollars to three dollars down and i said yes i think it costs about 17 dollars and says i wanted to get that rifle for you so bad she said the allowance that you give me amen she said i've never bought anything but i've been saving it that after i'm gone when you go home look under that old folding bed up there at the top of that paper and said you'll find it laying up there when i went home and found that about two dollars and eighty cents laying there where she saved to pay the pay that payment on the rifle i mean let me tell you something if we loved each other more like that there'd be less divorces amen husbands and wives loved each other like that amen you don't know how made that made me feel she was a real girl and she said another thing i want to apologize to you i said she said i did something wrong amen of all things her sister hoped to say of all the things to bring up she comes back and apologizes and i said what's that she said i kept something from you and i said what's that honey said remember that one time you bought them stockings and that says i don't know said we were at fort wayne and i said yes she said them was the wrong kind of stockings amen so i thought it was kind of funny when i got she got to fort wayne she had to get another pair of stockings but she told me she said there in her dying hour she said bill them was for older women i gave it to your mother she said that she kept she said that i kept that from you because i didn't want to hurt your feelings that you got oh my you don't know how that made me feel then i said bless your heart honey and she says now promise me that you will i said and she looked up she said bill i'm going bill that says are you honey she said yes i said sweetheart now listen he says we don't believe that you don't believe anything you can believe anything you want to but i don't believe that a christian dies there's no scripture for it he that hears my words and believeth on him that sent me has passed from death unto life i am the resurrection and life he said amen and i said honey i'll take your body out here and bury it and so forth now notice that she raised up them bony hands and embraced around me i kissed her goodbye and she closed her eyes and went to meet god that was my last date with my wife and by the grace of god i'm trying my best to make double time that's the reason that i try to preach so hard day and night in one campaign after another trying to make up for the time that i lost what brought me to this message was the thought that she would come back and she would be that honest that really all she had everything else was made right everything else was good but she just kept something from her husband that simple didn't want to hurt him in the first place right didn't want to hurt his feelings that he had done something wrong but she kept that from him just a little bit of perhaps dishonesty and she wanted to be honest with you on that little issue i wonder if we tonight search our hearts how many knows when you get over there it's going to be the little thing when you get to the door of death you want every little thing made right you want to be totally honest in your heart we don't want to get to daniel curry and get over there i mean that's not an excuse well i'll wait and let him cover it hello i believe is an example that here we want to make sure that everything we do is on us we're honest with each other husband and wife between each other you're honest open have everything right she came back and apologized come from heaven a beautiful place and says i want to apologize that i kept that from you she was an honest woman let's be honest people amen heaven's gonna be filled with absolutely completely totally honest people god bless you let's then musicians just hold on for a minute i'm going to do what brother our brother did let's bow our heads we're going to have just a little bit of a prayer yet before we get into a few songs perhaps i want to ask each and every one of you because i'll tell you one thing that the lord does with me is he'll bring things up in my mind i'm sure he probably does you there may be a lot of people sitting the holy spirit bring things up or out there in the radio land so to speak he'll bring things up behind and he'll show you things that you really ought to make right and a lot of times we'll make excuses in that right we'll justify ourselves but the holy spirit's sweet enough to keep bringing that up let me tell you something it's a whole lot better to live free you don't even really have to apologize maybe you don't really have to make it right but it bothers you it would be better to make it right and feel better it is to try to ignore it how many is in here tonight that have things like that in your life that you want to make right that you want to be honest about say god help me to be honest don't let me come to the door of death or have to come back but lord i want to be honest tonight i want you to take all my sins lord of all the past all the little things i want you to forgive me and if there's something that i need to make right with anybody god i'm not going to be ashamed to go to that person and make it right god bless those hands all over the building lord jesus we have people here father that because of what happened in this story a new word that tells us to be honest they want to have an honest heart they want to be honest in their heart and their life god they want nothing between them and you lord we want everything right god when we come to the river we want to be honest we want to know that we've made everything right that we possibly know anybody that we've got to go apologize to we want to go apologize we want to go say we're sorry we're not too proud to do that father because we want to be ready for the rapture when it comes we will already be ready to meet you in the air and so ever be with you in that place of paradise that the prophet his wife have already gone and are waiting for this
