========================================

certainly i believe why people mis miss god because they fail to think the way that god thinks and the way that god does amen amen brother we all know that if you're ever going to shoot a big boat you got to think like a big bump right you got to think like it you know you've got to go in that avenue and if you're ever going to amen if you're ever going to marry a wife if your wife your husband if you're ever going to marry let me tell you think like god thinks so the first way back before the foundation of the world we know that he had the fable that the devil had wrong thoughts he said he did not have the right thoughts amen and truly amen i believe that the body is becoming one with god in order to be united with him we got to think like he does if we're ever going to unite with him amen let me just say this while it comes to my mind i truly believe the rapture and the real christians are going to be so simple it's going to be so simple that people will miss it people will miss the rapture because it's the simplicity that it's going to be uh you know i'm humble it's going to be amen come on down come drop down into time and we know what happened of course with adam and eve and so forth and amen and and even the serpent and so forth come down to cain and abel and here cain and abel they both come to church they both worship god isn't i right they were very religious very serious but they brought the wrong offering cain brought the wrong offering he didn't worship the way that god wanted him to worship and did god accept it now tell me what all the churches and everybody that's worshipping the court i'm not according to the word of god do you think god is going to accept it no they're going to find themselves in the in outer darkness what is that outer darkness that outer darkness is the tribulation period outer darkness is when there's no light by the bright no light at all right because how many knows as long as the holy spirit is still on the earth dealing with us gentiles there's a little light but truly can we say that it will be completely blacked out in this generation when the holy spirit leaves amen but as long as there's a little bit of light there amen they're still amen there's still a little bit of light it isn't out of darkness but when that lifts its outer darkness or we would call it utter darkness tribulation period god's wrath to be poured down amen upon mankind and god we don't want to be here then you can't imagine it being that bad is that right and that we're right at the brink of it just think of it we're right at the brink of it so we find denominations and so forth they're still worshipping but they're worshiping in maine cain worshiped in maine he was serious he built a church he made an altar he brought the fruits of the ground and so forth and he brought all of that sacrifice to god but cain i mean abel he had a revelation god quickened to him that it's going to take blood to cover this thing it's going to take more than an apple to cover this it's going to take me more than oranges and flowers it's going to take blood something's going to have to die for what happened and what did he do he went out there and got a bloody lamb lamb and just hacked it the piece of the shred amen that cain was probably as the probably god put it saying what is wrong with you brother what are you doing you look like a horrible sight you are look like a sight to be look at that blood all over your face and your hands my you're just swallowing and you're all in that blood you know i squirted all over you huh cain was thinking his thinking wasn't right he didn't realize that even the prophet of god said that you know in the old testament people used to have to do that get it all over you because you had to be spring with the blood it had to be part of you just like the blood of jesus christ it's got to be all over you it's going to be very obvious that your blood you're covered by the blood amen and then they may not look good people man i'll tell you what it might cause people to scream and shout and cry hallelujah and everything else amen but the dead they still the canes they might say boy well look at that sight look at how they're acting how foolish that looks huh but that's what god's accepting god's what god's receiving somebody that's gotten hold of the blood that is identified with their sacrifice i mean believe you got to be identified with your sacrifice cain was not identified with the sacrifice abel was identified with the sacrifice amen and god accepted it and said that's my that i accept that worship he was accepted oh hallelujah i hope everybody at evening that time everybody to come out on this wednesday night and everybody on the air works i hope everybody's listening god either accepts your worship to him or he don't accept it you're accepted or you're not accepted if you're not accepted if it's not true and coming from the heart then it's like a stench in god's nose i don't want to bring worship that's a stench in god's nose how many believes and unless the blood of christ is on your heart tonight it's a sense it's a formality god doesn't look for just formalities amen when we get to heaven it's not going to be well maybe i need to say thank you lord maybe i need to say praise the lord well maybe i'd better try to sing amazing grace how sweet no it's not going to be formal it's going to come from the heart thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord that's what god is worth working for i mean looking for he's looking for that genuine amen better says man they came to church they worshipped they offered sacrifice but they did it and it become calm to him and god refused that when your worship to god becomes common god don't accept it anymore isn't that what the prophet said then it's the thoughts of god i mean it's glad to know the thoughts of god you can properly worship when you know the thoughts of god one god when you know what god is expecting from you but if you don't know what god is expecting you don't know how to do it can i just say what comes to mind let me tell you something we might call ourselves message believers we may have been this in 40 years that still don't make you right you can still be dead wrong and i've been in this message for i don't know how many years god is not looking at how much you know the message how many quotes you know or how many stories you can tell he is looking at your heart's condition and whether he dwells in there or he does not [Music] amen what age are we living in what age are we living what are we talking about tonight the thoughts of god in what age are we living in mind age you know when god restored the church he began to restore the man but just shall walk by faith luther's time come on up this is for sanctification of the heart wesley and them amen satanified got to be sanctified isn't that right all the way up here come all the way up to the mouth speaking your tongues in the interpretation of tongues and so forth all the way to the bow but what was it then we could come up to the prophets prophet even the prophet of god to be able to see see what color hair eve had all with his eyesight but the last part of the man is what his mind we're living in the mind age the prophet of god began to many times many messages towards the end there but he began to talk about the back part of god's mind can i just read you a little quote brother them says now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind amen hallelujah think about it one time god says my ways are as far as the heavens from yours but there come a time how many believes there come a time when that won't be that way anymore men before we go there let's just go down through the old testament a little bit shall we so we look at kate and abel they didn't think alike did they no they didn't think alike at all were their ways the same because i'll tell you you'll act the way that you think and cain he had a certain way of thinking brother branham even said that cain had the kind of religion that he says you know here it is lord this is the best i can do accept it or reject it what did the man say to god i'll do with it he will reject your attitude god doesn't accept what you offer him the best that you can do no you come on his terms you come the way he says and on his sermons or he he rejects it completely but cain had the idea this is the best i can do i forget brought it to you god don't want to accept it that's fine and he got the hate able because god accepted him and he let that hatred brew and he began to have such terrible ways until he killed his own brother become a murderer tried to get rid of his brother that genuinely was worshiping god that was king tried to get rid of him amen he certainly had not god's ways did he never has had god's ways he didn't think like he god was thinking amen but abel did think the way that god was thinking amen always my ways are above your waist how about pharaoh and moses talk about them for a minute how many know they thought completely different stop i want to go back let's pick up moses in a minute we go back to noah noah and the world is that right noah went up on top of the hill and i still ain't seen the noah's ark how many he knows are how many has been up there seen what they built what they called noah's ark not nobody here huh but a joke ben is a bus and we'll all go see noah's ark sometime we can use the exercise i understand it's a long walk am i right but however big that thing is it's huge from what i understand i think brother troy and them and some of them have went up talked about and so forth but they're noah went on top of that mountain is that right probably had four-wheel drives to get up there you know they had to have some serious pulling power to get it way up there and now i look like the most foolish person in the world but didn't even paul say that god chooses the foolish things of the world to confound the wise huh sure he did and noah seemed like a foolish person foolish person to go out there and build that great big boat you know and i think every one of us that respects god does this if john hershberger if any of you would come to me and you would say well god told me this was going to happen and he told me to do this or die to the other you and i would be careful about what we said or did not the only time you wouldn't really have to be careful is if you know that it's contrary to the word of god that's the one way we would gauge it but if you couldn't really judge it on that i'd zip my lip huh just like that video we showed of that preacher predicting that it would be chaos come this election well folks you don't have to read much of the news to know that they're organizing all kinds of rallies to bring disruption all over the place so they're already according to the news you know they're planning it but i can't say yey or nay but there's only one thing left to do and that is to wait find out if it was of the lord it'll come to pass if it wasn't then hey then truly was just a nightmare or a dream you know but it certainly would look like but what i'm trying to say is somebody says that hey the lord said this so forth that hey it's time to pay a little attention it catches your ear it's different if you just say well i think well that's what we did let me think too we all have an opinion but when you say the lord told me yeah that brings it up to a whole new level and that's the way it was with noah is that right noah told the world i'm telling you people i'm for 120 years i i'm coming out sunday morning again i want to preach the same message i did last sunday it's going to rain people all right somebody closing prayer i'll see you all next week huh open up again the next week year after year 120 years folks you better get right with god he told me to build this ark i'm a beaten away from week the week that sound that you hear that hammering that you're here and all of that that's because god told me to get ready he's going to flood the earth it's going to rain do you realize they probably didn't even know what the word rain meant what do you mean rain noah cause it ain't never done no raining all we ever have is a little mist that comes down from the heaven and wets everything we've never had a downpour isn't that what isn't that true the bible says they never did have a rain so they find out what rain means first yeah it's going to rain and it's going to keep raining and it's going to flood it until this mountain's going to pick up the boy i'll tell you what that's going to be some deep stuff yeah they found out it got real deep didn't it did you ever see pictures of people climbing on the rocks and half naked and everything else trying to find a place to live for just a few more minutes before drowning and certainly can you imagine even if it was a flood today all of the people out there with the tattoos and freaking looking people how to do their hair and everything you'd have all kinds of you'd say what is that crawling on that rock that's how it was back then it was terrible people are utterly vile anymore but there they were drowning they found out yeah it did but it won't be no flood this time folks if people will burn it's gonna be a fire amen we don't say it's gonna flood but we can come in here and we can preach every service guess what people it's gonna burn amen it's all gonna burn with fervent heat the elements shall melt with fervent heat i heard brother brown talking about them gas is up in the rap atmosphere here catching fire you know that stuff that they're trying to keep from gases up in the atmospheres those are catch fight the heavens will be on fire and the earth will catch fire it'll burn it'll be a fire unlike anybody has ever seen amen but we can preach it why because god said it i like that song david said standing on the promises of god amen but i'm talked about and i was listening today he says you know every word of god is god's promise amen when god promises something he don't have to promise nothing all he's got to do is say it and it's his promise because it isn't going to come back boy every word of god is his promise it won't return void and i'll tell you right now that's where we want to be in is part of his promise it's probably part of his word because heaven the nurse will pass away but his word shall never pass away amen so guess what he kept preaching and kept preaching he kept preaching until crash lightning huh everybody in their beds woke up that was a terrible illustration by the way everybody woke up what oh man it ain't never thundered before never enlightening before but here it is go read isaiah where it talks about when the destruction from the almighty comes people's hearts will melt just all their spirit will be gone they won't have any pride anymore they're going the dens in the caves of the rock they know god's coming when all that happens they'll know that god's coming folks he's rising and they're going to have to give an account for all they did run your jaws now you'll answer for it later yeah that's right take him out everything now but he'll come into your life later amen you won't get out of this scotch-free no you can even put a gun to your head that isn't going to end anything new you can't get out of it amen here it came how many knows did absolute either noah had what he had god's word which was god's thought amen it was his thought and it was his word and he preached it amen to the whole world and as stupid as it may have seemed to the world the smartest thing that anybody did was to get into that ark how many believes the smartest thing you'll ever do in this time in this world is to get into the ark of christ brother brown talked about the end coming and so forth and the band was living in jeffersonville moved over to tucson people were leaving there and they wanted to go to tucson and they were asking where should we be where should we be to make this rapture to escape where should we be should we go to tucson should we go to jeffersonville jesus said i got the word from the lord brother man says i got the word from the lord huh he said to tell you just gather in christ the king you ain't gotta not gather in jeffersonville or tucson but you better be in christ the only place of safety is in christ how many is glad for that amen amen moses oh man maybe i don't know how long their hair was back then the picture showed pretty long hair we definitely call him my hippie long hair long beard wasn't this beard according to picture way down here you know sticking his hand coming up requesting an audience with pharaoh huh and he got his audience with pharaoh pharaoh prestigious mighty i guess they were what the greatest nation on earth they're the greatest kingdom on earth come up there and he come up there and say what do you want moses what do you want but i want to just tell you what god has in mind god promised the children of israel those slaves that you got he rushed promised them back way back a few bibles not bibles but a few books back i'm not sure just which one it was but he says he's going to amend the children of israel be delivered into egypt so forth they'll go captive for 400 years and after so long a time i'm going to deliver them and bring them out huh moses perhaps began to preach the pharaoh and it's that this time that it's time to let him go amen pharaoh asked well who sent you i know you ain't here by yourself huh what what nation do you represent what army do you represent who sent you he said well i am that i am because didn't even moses say look when i get up there who am i going to say that sent me and he says just tell them i am that i am sent you i imagine pharaoh i don't know how much he was versed into hebrews and their god perhaps he didn't know what who the i am the iam was perhaps he didn't i don't know but i would just presume perhaps he says the i am that i am wow what a riddle who is that it's god oh like i said a while ago when you said god it's time for ears to perk up a little bit pharaoh's ear should have perked up a little bit but he said god has sent me huh the bible's deep because i have to wonder i'm just going to wonder this if pharaoh wouldn't have let him go after the water turn into blood and everybody was drinking blood instead of water said all right i can't think this no more just get them and go but the bible says that god actually hardened his heart am i right harden his heart and he wouldn't let him go and wouldn't let him go amen i mean the fleas and stuff got so bad until he was in his bed no doubt and it says he was in his bed chambers and everywhere else and man he was trying to lay down and he felt little cleaves crawling up the lake under the brake and under the sheets and i don't know about you but i could not stand something like that i live in florida and i did that happened to me one time i tried our little old trailer when we first got married it was so infested with please we had to bomb it the next day like yo but why wasn't this fleas up in here so i can understand how pharaoh must have felt oh boy i'll tell you we're willing to do anything to get rid of all that but he still wouldn't let him go oh now he still wouldn't let him go not until the first spawn ain't that right finally moses said since you are so hard and you are you since you're so stubborn anybody that hasn't caught the blood on the lentil and so forth of every cow wasn't it even the animals from what understand and all the firstborn of human beings he always going to die and brother baby menstruated at one time he says those hebrews no doubt saw this great big black angel and the great weak wings coming out of the skies and coming down over the city made it coming down and that black thing was just coming down and everybody would run into their houses getting under the safety of their amen blood covered doors they would hear screaming they were here crying all through the city of egypt why one man had the thoughts of god and the other one thought he was more powerful than god he felt wrong isn't that right he thought wrong he didn't have god's thinking he had his own thinking and it didn't matter he was so stubborn with his own thinking i want you to know something that if you're a carnal person you are a stubborn carnal person because our carnal minds is stubborn oh it is stubborn it takes oh my it takes to get knocked down like paul did on damascus road and that right for us to break from our stubbornness he could not just stop and guess what not until his army huh was drowned in the red sea isn't that right it's red drowned in the red sea and i don't know if you ever watched that movie moses but it comes back i forget exactly the words but pharaoh's wife said something about my my here you are you don't even have army left moses who you thought so little of because god was with him he may just had a stick come on people is that awesome to think that it doesn't matter you ain't gonna have much if you've got god you got everything you got all you need if you got god on your side i'm so glad for that amen that if you've got god you've got what you need you can be happy praise the lord amen we're going to come down into the new testament now we know that the prophet taught us that god fulfills his scriptures in such simplicity one thing about god and the way that god thinks is in simplicity and what is the other word humility we as human beings we like it complicated we make it technical huh we always overlook everything we overshoot everything we're always trying to make everything big it has to be big it has to be great and most christians when they become christians want to become great and you brother bram says you go straight down you go vice versa because in order to become a christian you had to go down you had to become nothing and nobody amen that's how you even have to become to become a christian in hubility amen and so brother brandon made reference to one scripture he's talking about what john the baptist and so forth comes how that the clap the leaves will clap their hands and the high places will be made low and the lower places will be made high and oh the the hills will skip like rams and the all the leaves will cut their hand but they had an interpretation in their mind it's gonna be a great thing and brother bam says here comes an old long bearded man with a sheepskin wrapped around him whiskers on his saying repent the vipers huh and so forth and getting the people to repent and that was all of this when all the high places were made low isn't that right then john about to say says you know what did you come out to see and so forth you know he says talks about you generation of snakes the axes lay to the root of the tree all the high pharisees were brave brought low ain't that right the low places were made high at that time it was simplicity and yet they pretty much much missed john the baptist you know right i forget the percentage i forget the percentage that brother brandon gave of how many people knew that jesus was actually here it was not a very big percentage was it it was very small percentage of the people of the earth that actually even knew that he was here and let me just ask you this about malachi 4. behold i send you elijah prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord do they come with that shall burn as an oven law that do wickedly shall be ashes and stubble under the soldier you feel all of these things malachi 4 god sends that malachi 4 and while he was here while he was here how many really knew he was how many open doors he put a batman 64 and 65 right there at the end pentecostals had all put him out out amen so few actually knew that maleficent was actually here today we have a great mormon number that recognized it mean that right africa and all of those places even they exploded after the prophet was gone it's still they're still having a revival and that right well we send our missionary work and so forth whether there's people coming to the message out of the denominations and so forth amen but even they didn't realize it amen so we take this mysterious god we the one that created the heavens and far beyond ours and john the baptist introduces emmanuel god with us i think saint john first chapter some of where it talks about that jesus he was the express image of this person how many knows when jesus came he was the expressed image of god he expressed god perfectly he showed us perfectly how god thinks and how that god is a merciful god full of grace full of love full of truth so much so that when that woman was to stone him to kill him to death and they bring it to him and say here here's a rock your law says if you're of god that she's to be stoned killed isn't that right and he began to draw things in the sand how many times how many times the pharisees would ask him about paying taxes to caesar you know for all the terrible things he does because you know they support abortion if you pay your taxes you're supporting abortion maybe you made it a good case you know is that right uh so should we do this that will you know and jesus every time or whether it's a brother marrying his brother's wife because he passed away in the bible says you know you're going to do whose wife is going to be over there and all kinds of complicated questions to ask him and it says that at the end of it all no man there's asking many more questions i like that why because he was a fountain of wisdom man and he was the one that created the alphabet brother you know you're not gonna out talk him you're not gonna catch him in his words not him you aren't amen because that's what they tried to do is find fault in his words and they couldn't do it he had the perfect thought he had the perfect thinking he had god's thinking amen amen i know it's a rainy dark but it's not too cold night amen one of them nights where you could sure stay home amen or go home early isn't that right y'all smile come on i ain't reading your mind but you know it's always an honor it's all it's good to honor the lord i'm glad for the services that we have amen i believe it's the way that we honor the lord amen so we won't go too long but i want to go to first corinthians let's look at what paul said about the way that god thinks the thoughts of god and the way that he thinks because i'll tell you this i thank god in this generation that he truly told us how that god thinks because if you can't pick up on that and that become you you're gonna fail you're gonna miss it amen i think we'll go all the way down to um verse 25 of the first chapter of first corinthians let's go first corinthians 1 and 25. let's say it forwards instead of backwards getting older you say things backwards let's go to the 25th verse of the first chapter the first corinthians see that's backwards anyway i do that a lot because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than oh praise the lord how many knows weak little david was stronger than big monster goliath brother moses no matter how old he was and how feeble he looked he was stronger than pharaoh and all of his army david was stronger for you not many mighty not many noble are called muhammad knows that truly moses was a noble man he was a great man when he was in egypt but god had to take him on the backside of the desert paul also was a well-known scholar he was also a great man in that right so not always it says not very many are called doesn't mean that god doesn't call some of them is that right not many uh noble are called but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty amen when i thought about this scripture it reminded me of how that perhaps in today's world how did the world looks like come to church on wednesday and worship the lord and they think it's just kind of foolish sisters in their dress they dress kind of old-fashioned perhaps what the world calls foolish god calls great they might call you old-fashioned because you wear a dress or a skirt and you don't wear makeup you have long hair people can certainly identify you and they might call you old-fashioned but i call you holy amen and brother bam says you know old-fashioned really jesse bell that was long ago and she wore makeup so maybe that's old-fashioned huh she dressed herself up that's old-fashioned perhaps amen but we know the dogs ate her amen all you can say is well look i'm not of this world i'm not here trying to look like everybody else i'm trying to please my lord because one of these days what you call foolishness is gonna be gone and one day let me tell you something one day god will show the whole world that what the world call foolishness he chose that's his amen [Music] here's something to console here's something to encourage us out of weakness and humility god chooses the people to build his kingdom out of if you ever get to heaven or we if we ever stand in the presence of god with his church will stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world how many is glad not to fit in with the world cast out by the world they cast you out amen but brother brown says man a preacher came and says you know if i preach that they'll kick me out he says well which one do you want you want to be kicked out here or do you want to be kicked out over there you're going to get kicked out somewhere you're going to be despised somewhere you're going to be rejected somewhere i would rather be rejected by the world and the people of this world and to be accepted by god because we have a much longer revision than the next president or the next beyond that or the next beyond that we're looking prone to the end of it all and looking to the other worlds that's what we're looking to and we're getting ready for that world why do you dress like that sister because i'm getting ready for another world it's coming god promised it do you believe god's promises because if you do you better be getting ready are you with me we can rejected and cast out by the world and know this and know it nothings how many knows that most people think they know it all we're not know it alls but a band calls us know it nothings amen comes to mind you know what comes to mind right here paul i've read and came to you not with excellency of speech or wisdom declaring to you unto you the testimony of god for i am determined not to know anything among you except jesus christ and then crucified that's what you're going to know asked paul what he knew are you smart are you a scholar of the scholar sure i was but i had to forget all of that and to become nothing you know what nothing except that jesus christ died for my sins that's what i do know amen how many believes that god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the wise i wish i knew what that word confound means and to confound the things which are mighty perhaps confused perhaps dumbfuzzle like how could that ever happen i'm sure pharaoh said that after he sat after he thought he would win he was confounded wow how did that ever happen confound the things that are mighty the base things of the world amen how many knows jesus was the chief base person huh isn't it something that jesus made sure that he was the one that washed the disciples feet first he gave him an example peter was like all the world isn't us as human humans are for the most part the disciples he it says uh i've got the scripture there but you'll know what i'm referring to i'll just make reference he says you know they there was a dispute among them who's going to be the greatest and that right that was their thought pattern that's what man thought who's going to be the greatest and jesus had to begin to tell him you know if you want to be the greatest you're going to have to be servant of all because here in the world that i'm speaking about the way that i think the last they're going to be first and the first here are going to be last there and that right you want to be top dog you want to be the first well guess what you'll be last over there but if you'll be the last that's why peter said humble yourself under the mighty hand of god we as human beings and especially if you're a christian you humble yourself humble yourself because if you lift yourself up god will bring you down that's right that i that's how he believes that's the way god thinks that's what that's that's god's thoughts it used to be a mystery to us but that's what jesus taught that's what paul taught amen the things that are despised has god chosen the aid of things which are not to bring to not the things that are so that what no flesh should glory in his presence amen how many knows it's not about you it's not about me it's about him amen praise the lord brother ben makes a quote when jubilee here jubilee here jubilee year wait one another do service for one another don't be bigger than somebody else try to see how little you can be amen fox says have holes birds have nests but the son of man had nowhere to lay his head i'll i'm here to tell you that most of the time the children of god in the early age especially they were considered bums and you know we just don't have in our society not us here people don't have very much highest theme or much thought of a bomb but these were not just normal bums these were people that sold everything and had nothing but they loved the lord and they served god and god always supplied for them jesus he didn't have much he couldn't even pay his taxes until a fish spit out all the money for it and that right he became poor so that you could become rich he was despised and rejected so that you can be accepted how many believe that god became man so that man could become like god so that we could be like jesus he became us he became sin and he became a curse preaching on a curse remember he says cursed it is everyone that hangeth on the tree and jesus hung on a tree became a curse so that we could become blessed i've often heard say don't never be big in your own side amen if you're big let it be in the sight of god but belittle in your own sight and every man that humbles himself god will exalt but those who exalts himself god will bring a base see be little be little amen listen friends the more simpler that you can be the more god can deal with you amen you've got to forget all you ever knowed in your own knowledge to know christ you just become childlike and accept him that's all that's the way you accept god and the more simple you can be the more humble the more you can get away from yourself and your own ideas just take god's word for it amen and believe it for it's by faith that you believe amen jesus talked with simple language with the simple people and was written likewise and they're trying and they're trying to but those great big swelling outstanding hold on for dear life as i would call it words in it and they miss it so it was wrote simple correct so simple as it was to bring the gospel to the poor and the needy amen that's what makes him great to me but a guy that sticks his chest out and thinks he's somebody that shows how little he is to me that's right the more simple you can get the higher god can raise you so just be simple brother bam says that's why when africa and india and so forth god did so much more because here in america people are so educated until they're educated away from god they think they know more about it than god does god bless you let's stand tonight musicians if you'll come i think the second chapter of first corinthians paul talks about how that no man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man that is in him and neither knoweth man the things of god except the whole by the holy spirit that's in him and then he goes to talking about who has been god's instructor who's known the mind of christ instruct him and he sums it up with this he says you know here's this but we have the mind of christ another place it says let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus amen how many believes where they have the mind of god not only the mind of god but we're honored and privileged to be able to like jesus said in saint john 14 the works that i do shall you do also and greater works than these shall you do because i go unto the father now it isn't that god is so far away anymore but god has become down and come become part of us so that we could have his mind have his works amen and be pleasing to the lord god bless you let's bow our heads search your heart tonight ask yourself if truly you can say yes i try to live every day thinking only what christ would think try to have his thoughts try to do his works i wonder how many tonight would say i need more of that brother but i need more of the thoughts of god in my life every day just to be thinking like him whatever situation arises then we can truly say like that little phrase goes what would jesus do what would jesus think how would jesus react amen what would jesus work because that's what i want the works that i do share you also god bless those hands a hungry heart to be more like jesus lord our hands are up saying father help us to have your thoughts to think your thoughts take our old thoughts away lord jesus don't never let us think from our carnal mind because paul has taught us that the carnal mind is enmity against god it's not subject to god neither indeed can be we have to take on your mind lord and that's what we desire tonight lord so that tomorrow we go to jobs when we go do whatever we're going to do we do it in the name of jesus christ under the power of the holy spirit living his life i ask god tonight that you draw each one father both those those that are here and those that couldn't be here lord father that you would draw them all closer to you lord and help each one of us to realize that you're coming for a wife to live with you in your palace for a thousand years and we need to have the same kind of thinking that you thought lord to believe your word and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god shall man live by lord help us to live that way help us to live your life and lord take the throne of our heart lead and guide us now in jesus name amen and amen
