[Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning if we all would stand and the children can be dismiss for Sunday School brother Glenn would you open us up in a word of Prayer amen if we would turn to Romans 6 we'll read verses uh 1 through 14 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound know ye not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ we baptized into his death for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection for he that is dead is freed from sin knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord neither yield ye your members as in instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God this one together for sin Shall Have No Dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace brother Brian you can seated you know that last verse in that chapter is one of those ones you hear in those Bible tracks where it says for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord I was reading one of those quotes up there I was just thinking what do we have to to worry about you know the life wants to make you worry about everything this age wants to make you to worry about everything but if you're really committed and God has put you on the path there isn't anything to worry about anymore in the life that we live you know as I get older just myself as a man I don't like starting your are voice that probably didn't when I was just he was coming to the prayer line and as he was coming to the end where he wasn't revealing what is in the hearts of the people the people's Faith was starting to wave because they weren't seeing that revealed and he was admonishing them that they shouldn't be that way no matter what he's saying to those people their faith alone should be enough to heal them of their afflictions and their desire what they need in their life you don't need to see it in a physical form if you have the faith of Jesus Christ abiding in your heart as good Gentiles you just reach out in faith believ in God's word and he'll bring it about in your hearts and lives this morning morning but if you would turn with me to um Hebrews the 12th chapter I'll try not to scream in the mic this morning I was um I was reading a a different devotional this morning and um this is what someone had to say uh if I don't if I didn't lose it this morning yeah but um I'll just read these couple of these verses this morning but the the one thing about where we're at this morning is that we all need to be patient in the age that we live in don't let the things of life or the things going on out in the world don't let them Shake Your Foundation this morning so I'll just read what Paul had to say here and I and you know you have confidence in the message of yah that you can say Paul wrote the book of Hebrews everyone else will want to argue with you about there out there in the world you know and I think they want to argue with with you because if Paul wrote it then it's just as inspired as any other part of the Bible is and it goes to say here wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with such great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin that which do so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us and and like any good uh Christian you you believe the word of God you're going to apply that by faith and life looking on to Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith for who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising despising the shame sat down at the right hand of God and the Throne of God and for considered him that endureth such contradictions of Sinners against himself least he be wary and faint in your minds and I was let me turn here if you want to turn you can turn back to uh Psalms the uh 39th and 40th chapter I'm not read those right now there's some scriptures in there I was going to read this morning but this is what this man he was using that scripture there this morning but this is really striking for the day you know this is 80 years old what when he wrote This Was 80 years ago but uh the scripture he uses the one I just read let us not run with patience the race that set before us looking on to Jesus the author and finish of our faith but this is what this man had to say here we are not willing to admit many of our spiritual weaknesses I got to raise most of us are that way you really don't want to look at yourself really too hard sometimes or what your weaknesses are but he most of us will admit that we are impatient with our friends the government even God himself I know none of us would admit to this but sometimes we get impatient when we don't see God doing for us what we think he should be doing for us in the time that we think it is makes us impatient sometimes and the worst thing to be is impatient makes you make maybe make a decision or walk out in something without the will of the Lord and find yourself being wrong but he goes on we would like to he goes on to say we' like to possess our souls in patience but how in Heaven's name can we is there a secret of patience the writer of the Epistles to the Hebrews replies the secret is to concentrate upon the one who is patience incarnate so to be patient that means everything in your life has to be focused on Jesus Christ this morning and I can't pronounce this this Bible scholar from a thousand years ago but I'll just I miss name once he said the Pharisees should have recognized who Christ was by his patience but I was you know just being a Bible reader like I am I'm reading that sentence but if you go to Matthews the I'm not going to read five chapters but if you go from like Matthew the 22th chapter to like the 26th chapter Jesus got to a point in his life I don't know if I just turn this off but he got to a point where he couldn't where he couldn't keep quiet anymore with the Pharisees and all of a sudden he just let them know what they were in God's eyes but I'll just read in his Temptations he refused to shortcut the fame and Power in his dealings with his Apostles he had constant disappointments and never lost Faith and Hope upon the cross he was patient even with those who crucified and prayed for them he was an active excuse me he had active patience patient does not mean passivity though also you can be patient with people but you still got to tell tell them the truth sometime and lead him the way they need to be I lost my place what what I was doing reading here you have to forgive me I have a habit of doing that it means doing our best in the confidence that God will use our best and the right results will follow you are not to sit with patience but to run with patience it doesn't mean you don't stop doing things waiting on God to give you an answer you just keep doing what a Christian's supposed to be doing anyone who has learned a new language or how to play a music knows that active patient is much much as work is to be done in faith in order the results May follow Jesus could run with patience a course that was set before him with all its hardship because his faith that God would use his life that of the apparent defeat would come Victory and I was just something in my mind reading that excuse me he was able to do that because he knew who he was in the scriptures just like this morning we have to know who we are this morning in the scriptures and if once you know that and you have that Revelation this morning you'll have the faith that you need to be successful in the age that we live and I'll just read a few more scriptures here with not having a lot to say but if you would turn I'm reading from the 40th Psalm this morning I'm going to read like three or four or five verses and it says uh this is what David had I waited patiently for the Lord and He inclined onto me and heard my cry so David knew these principles also he waited on the Lord patiently to get his answer he brought me up also out of the horrible pit and out of the myy clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings so it wasn't David doing it was God doing it for him he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it and shall fear and trust in the Lord and blessed is that man that make the Lord his trust and respect not the proud nor such as to turn aside to lies so basically you're no matter what's going on in life you don't put others before or after others everything you do in life is consistent David is saying here many oh Lord my God are thy wonderful Works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are usw that cannot be reckoned up in order onto thee if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered and what strikes me about that scripture right there is we forget that God thinks about us God cares about us he has thoughts about you he has desires for you you're just not a a statue or something out there just moving to and fro without no concern God has concern for us all this morning he has a desire for you and your life this morning and sometimes times we just don't fathom how much God loves and cares for us this morning and then he I'll finish the I I lost my place but I'll finish with the sixth verse this morning sacrifice and offerings that did not desire mine ears has thou opened birth offerings sin offerings H has thou not reced and I I'll I know I'll just keep reading if I don't stop this morning you know the most comforting thought in the day that we live this morning I would say it's just like that quote said this morning what are you worried about what do you what I mean there are things that you have to be concerned about but when it comes to your soul and your relationship with Jesus Christ just there shouldn't be any worry if God has started that walk in your life this morning he's going to finish it this morning I it goes back to I can only as a Bible reader go back to the Bible and it goes back to uh first Corin thians the 13th chapter you know love Hope and Faith if those three things abide in you this morning there's nothing in your life that's going to stand between you and him this morning as long as you put your whole hope and trust in him this morning brother Josh man welcome everybody this morning come we sing Victory in Jesus number 22 I heard an old old Story how a savior

help and everything you know that we can amen certainly manage and and have that and we'll see how that turns out would that be okay so and I've prayed about it just how to do it and that's what I kind of feel L to go the direction I'd like to go amen with y'all's support amen so praise the Lord and that'll be of course in September amen then August I think we've got what's his name brother coming in August Nick is it Nick or the other brother Nick Wright yeah he'll be coming for our August for an August so amen we've got ministers lined up amen amen so praise the Lord we've I don't know about you but so far this year I've enjoyed the ministers we've had to come through haven't you amen and so Pastor is always particular about who comes amen what's said and what kind of food that you eat amen amen I care about that amen because I believe we uh and I tell you we just had just a real good wholesome food all right through so amen we appreciate the Lord and what he's doing amen and his goodness to us this morning amen I just have a little thought Amen on that's what God is for it's basically the thought that came to my mind so that's not my title we have a title called we have an altar amen but amen I remember a song that said went something to the extent that's what the altar is for amen amen you don't have to carry your burdens anymore that's what that's for amen and so we want to see just what God is for amen amen and so it's kind of different but amen it won't be amen anything just too out there but if you will stand with me we'll just pray and ask God to come in a special way and amen and have his way this morning once again amen really enjoyed that last song Amen because it certainly goes along with what we want to speak on Amen even as it did Wednesday amen Lord Jesus we bow our heads Lord Jesus father to the dust even as your Prophet said many times from where we were made Lord for in this flesh and in this body that's all we are is a little bit of dirt but father we realize that inside of that dirt Lord there's something worth 10,000 worlds Lord father it's so valuable it's worth father 10,000 worlds and that is our soul that's our being that's the life that we have father and Lord we come before you this morning Lord Jesus and we ask God that once again you would just have your Divine Way in the service father bless those be with those God the elderly especially that are streaming those that can't be here for whatever reason Lord that they would just bless them as they stream and may it be clear and father may we may may they receive the word father that as it goes forth Lord we believe God that as we can just receive it and accept your word as it comes father miracles can happen father so many times we've heard father of people streaming Lord and you going and doing something special Lord if there's somebody out there that needs a Special Touch father may you touch them in a special way this morning we think of sister margorie Lord Jesus in a special way this morning she's requested prayer father the doctor says the blood is not where it her blood is not where it should be yet he wants her to go to the hospital and get an IV and get more iron put in Lord and she's just requested prayer and father we do ask God that you will get the iron and everything else that's supposed to be right in her blood Lord and get it to where it should be and so she can have strength and health Lord she's requested it you said ask what you will and you'll do it father and we believe it Lord father for you know every heart every need that's here in the congregation this morning Lord and we just pray father you'll come and Minister Lord Jesus to those needs for that's what you are for and that's what you do that's who you are and father we ask God that you just bless the meditation of a heart and that which you if you let on laid on my heart to speak this morning Father may it benefit and edify the body of Christ Lord in Jesus Christ name amen and amen all right let's turn our bibles if you will let's go to Hebrews 13 just a couple scriptures and a few quotes amen amen I guess I'll just share my thought amen I thought about just a small T title and you know brother brandham had a lot of small titles but he did he said you know it's not the amount of words that it is isn't that right but what's what those words mean and the power behind it amen that's what it's it's all about amen just like that little stamp amen that little boy sold is that right it was worth so much because of what was on it and that's the way the Bible is because of what's on it amen and uh that's just the way it is with the the Bible amen just couple of words like if thou can't believe all things are possible amen it's few words but it's lot of power behind it amen amen so that's the word of God okay Hebrews amen Hebrews 13 and 10 we have an altar amen we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle and then over in St Luke if you would let's go to St Luke 4 St Luke 4 14 and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit unto Galilee and there went out a Fame of him through all the regions round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it is written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the broken heart it to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight of the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen praise the lord well let me just kind of follow my notes Here for a minute we talk about God Amen being not even God at one time he was just a self-existing one a that right all by himself amen and I got to thinking you know God was sufficient in himself amen he was perfectly at peace with himself by himself nobody could ever even think our finite Minds can't even imagine how long it was that God was by himself Ain that right it's incomprehensible is it yeah that's right but we know that he is amen and he had what I say Amen uh perhaps what we would might call a treasure box in heaven all right he had a treasure box amen because how many knows that God himself is a treasure box yeah I think Jesus said something that the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure right that a man found in a field amen he found this treasure in the field and hid it I guess and went and sold all that he had and went and bought that field amen he went and bought that field a't that right and that's the way God is he's got he's this treasure he he could have stayed by himself he could have stayed alone y was quiet this morning got to say something I guess before you get all excited don't I but my thought was aren't you glad aren't you glad he didn't W yeah I'm glad he didn't stay by himself I'm glad he didn't keep his treasure to himself but what did he do he opened up the treasures all of The Treasure of Heaven he opened it up and he said whosoever will let him come come and get some of this treasure here's a question for you I like asking y'all questions what is the greatest treasure that you have I believe brother Braham said it was life preached on life the greatest thing that there is is life well if you didn't have life you just wouldn't have much would you no so all the other things that pertain to life those may be valuable and good but the fact that you have life that's most important that's what's real valuable amen and not just your natural life that your mom and dad gave you or that come from Mom and Dad is that right not just that life because that life we know will end up in misery it'll end up in death it comes the wrong way it's got the wrong desire it's got the wrong nature to begin with amen so there's not a whole lot to that life but now when you've got another kind of Life John 3:16 life he gave his only begotten son so that who whever amen how many believes Jesus Christ died on the altar so to speak shed his blood on the altar so that you could become a possessor of the great Treasures of Heaven W now get this we're going to talk about what God does and has done and then we want to talk talk about the response a little bit huh I don't know about you but when I do something and a uh uh build something I like to see the the fruit of it amen when I'm nice to you and say how do you do brother I don't expect ah get away from me you don't shake my hand huh how mean you expect a response most of the time you get a response but I want to talk about that response and God expects a response and can I say God's going to get a response there's going to be a response to what God does are y'all okay this morning is there some hooky spooky any anything anybody got any kind of Spooks in your mind right now because we seem to be just a little bit you know let's break it all out now and you just get away from yourself forget about the cares or whatever you're thinking about we're in church here amen the word of God by hope I hope I'm preaching word ain't that right amen you see folks I think I thought about this and how that you know we're taught and we're told you know uh it's not about who you are but it's about who he is it's not about what you done that's what proph of God don't don't the devil will try to tell you what you done you done this and you done that and you done this you done that well the only way you'll ever get Victory is to tell him yeah but he did this and he did that he went to Calvary he shed his blood amen so that he could undo what you did amen you might think you can never undo what you did some people might say you'll never undo what you did I am here to bring you some news that at this altar amen this blood of Jesus Christ that day on Calvary amen that blood is enough Amen to undo what you did it's there to justify bring you the Treasure of justification amen we know that that means what what does justification means as though I want you to get that in your hard drive it means as though you never done it in the first place his blood undos everything you done it's not about what you did it's about what he done amen praise the Lord I'm glad for that aren't you he can undo your whole past as long as he's on that Mercy Seat as long as that blood is still good and it is amen you can start a new day if you're down if you're depressed if you're backslid if you're away it don't matter you could stop again amen boy oh boy I'm here to tell you at this altar there is just so much that's what that altar is for how many beli that that's what Jesus died for my first focus and what I want to get in your mind with the help of the Lord is that Jesus said he didn't come amen for those who don't need a physician ain't that right for people who have it on and if you don't need God he didn't come for you no he come for those that are sick he come to heal the brokenhearted he come to preach to the poor he come to preach a captive and set the captive free Amen brother Tommy you can tell them I may not be able to get you out of prison but I can get you out of prison amen you might be a captive here but I've come out Jesus Christ that comes to set the captives free you can be behind the deepest inner prison amen and still be as free as a bird free from sins free from sorrow see free from death and sadness amen free from yourself free from condemnation amen oh my cuz that's what he does Amen brother Joshua I don't know if you can but I'd like to sing that song afterwards way maker way maker amen that's who you are I like that cuz that's who he is that's who God is somebody that comes oh my how many knows and I've preached on this before I like this this this thought and that is that we are a very needy people this world is very needy and God allowed us to get into a needy Place why because he's The Specialist of meeting your needs that's what he does is meet people's needs Paul said I believe he says my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in Christ Jesus oh your name no wonder we act crazy no no wonder we get a little happy sometime to think that all of your needs that you'll ever have are met they're already supplied God has already given that to you he's already he's all I need listen he's all I need he's all I need how many knows the Holy Ghost is all your need he's all you need brother Bram said when you've got the Holy Ghost you've got every every every I like saying every every everything that you'll ever have need of in this life in death and in the world to come I'm convinced that we need to grasp that a little bit deeper believe that a little bit stronger amen praise Lord God is good so that's what he is now I think brother Brandon had I realized this after this thought came to me but brother Brandon preached something similar and I got some quotes from it that I'd like to just read a couple would that be okay don't like my preaching maybe you'll like his listen I was talking on the power of prayer and this is a message called what was the Holy Ghost given for amen what was it given for what's it for the power of prayer the power of speech the power of a holy life that's what the Holy Ghost is to do some of you people walking around saying well I just can't quit drinking I can't quit this amen the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make all of the Cs get away from you how many believe that that's what God is for it oh I can't yes you can he'll take a cat and he'll turn it around and make it it yes I can oh I got some good ones are you ready amen I wrote down here what do you think amen make all the camps get away from you he'll turn your impossibilities into possibilities he'll turn your probabilities into realities well maybe it's probably it's not just probably but bring it into a reality gu that's what we need listen to another one I wrote down probabilities turns your Invisibles into vises turns the things that you can't see into things that you can't see just like Abraham did with his son he was given a promise it wasn't there but eventually guess what Sarah's Billy begin to get big that's right oh I see yeah oh you have had to throw up you don't feel the best well after that belly gets to getting a little bit bigger hey there's got up in there that's right that baby begin to show that's right in impossibility into a possibility that's what God does God is a specialist this altar that we go to amen we go to a god that is a specialist and he's special I es in things impossible we go to work every day we make money we get our check we go home we supply for our family Bible says he that don't supply for his family is worse than the Infidel and mean there's all the things that you can do and God allows you to have health to do those but there's other things that you can't do that's where he comes in how many believe that oh hallelujah praise the Lord listen brother bam says we are given to know that Lord that if there's any rivers that we cannot cross if there's any mountains we can't go through God Specializes in doing things that others cannot do you are a specialist on the job amen if your doctor can't help you then you have the right to go to a specialist amen if the specialist can't help you you you've got to go to The Specialist of Specialists woo how many believe God is a specialist of Specialists oh my I thank God today that I'm living on the other side of calvary or should I'd say this side of Calvary not the other side this side of Calvary when brother Bram he listened to that message that day on Calvary you talk about a powerful message amen because he said on that side they all looked they all looked to Calvary to that one that was supposed to come this is one time that brother B says and every Christian down through all of time since then has always look back to Calvary amen years I spent my uh days in vanity and pride knowing not that my Lord was crucified amen not knowing that it was for me that he died where on Calvary it was Calvary that did it it's your faith in Calvary it's your faith in the cross it's your faith in the blood and the power of the blood that's that's where your faith lies what he did the price being paid for amen amen so he specializes preaching the gospel to the poor healing the Brokenhearted preaching Deliverance to the captives recovering of the sight of the blind saving the Lost what I meant to say by saying all that this side of Calvary that side of Calvary on that side of Calvary no matter how much they wanted to they couldn't they'd say I can't and they couldn't that right they would go and offer the Bloods of bulls and goats they'd offer it every year every year it would never change their nature it would never change their desires it had never change their thirsts folks just think of it even Paul said you know if they'd have been made perfect through that we we wouldn't have needed Jesus a that right no they would never be made perfect but when Christ's blood came it takes the very desire for shin outen it changes you that altar we have to go to they don't have no right that serve the the flesh amen but you've got a right to come to this altar amen and when you come to the altar folks I don't care if you're a young person old person amen the gospel is for young people the old people it's the same for everybody that when you come to this altar if you want to get saved if you want to get clean you've got to repent you've got to turn around from your sins you've got to accept Jesus just like your mama did like your daddy did amen and come down to the altar of your heart and saying God I give you my life I give you my all I accept what you did I Repent of my sin and the Holy Ghost will come down and you'll be able to sing that new song well that's the way I got it I got it I got it that way and you can get it you can get it that way it's still good amen praise the Lord I like that you can go to the specialist of Specialists amen I like this story reminds me of a fellow in Florida not long ago he was talking said he had a Chevrolet car that he went out went out on him in Florida said he took it to the garage and his mechanic was going along and he got everything set together couldn't get it to start it was nervous he was nervous running all over the building picking up this and that and the man was standing there waiting on my car and and sir I'm late can you get it he said I'm doing all that I can nervous and carrying on he walked along directly A well-dressed gentleman walked up there and looked at him a few moments and he said to the mechanic after he let him butt his head around a little while he says why why don't you just touch this and you're not getting any current so he says I thought I never thought of that so he just turned that other little thing over here what it was there and he says and the current in the car started he turned around and he said who are you and you know who he was the chief engineer of General Motors he made the thing amen when you're bumping your head you're Buton your head here and Buton you don't know which way to turn just go to the chief engineer he built you he built the whole thing just call on the specialist all he has to do is make some adjustments get you to repent and turn around he can transform your amen dead vehicle dead power no life amen it give you new life amen not just have mechanics but have the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost oh my if you're just a phenomenal Christian yeah I'm a Christian amen you need to have more than that you need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost amen we our power went out about 6:30 this morning and there for a minute I couldn't text out or nothing but if I go out on my front porch I'll have one bar I think I texted brother Carson trying to find out whether they had power up the hill there text Caleb is there any power at church is there any power at church well I can't really to let everybody knows the powers out and so forth and I says I'm going to church amen and I've got this I don't know why I thought it would be dark we wouldn't even need the lights but I was going to bring the little Lantern if I had to my little Lantern have somebody who'd come up here and hey we going to have church at least we got running water you can use the bathrooms amen but I thought you know is there any power of church and I thought well there might not be any in the electrical system but there'll be power of church if we'll show up amen cuz the church is you the church chur is made and you've got power how many believe when you got the Holy Ghost you got power if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you're powerless God hates a powerless church God wants a church with power amen and God is a specialist so listen he's in the power of the holy ghost seeing I can't do the holy comes Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make all these CS get away from you amen make women stop cutting their hair make them quit wearing shorts and slacks no excuses make them quit paddling yes sir that's what it's for to make you live a holy life it'll follow the instructions of the Bible every time if you'll notice he said no excuses how many the Holy Ghost the power of almighty God comes to take our excuses away I don't want no excuse well I'm this way I don't this don't give be no excuse the Holy Ghost will come take away all excuses amen not only will he take the cancer away but he'll take excuses away would it be safe to say that if you make excuses you're still living below your privileges you're living where the devil wants you to live well I just can't or I'm not good enough or you know so and so I just can't do it because to that person or excuses excuses you hear them every day amen take away them excuses amen praise the Lord oh it's to make you quit you're smoking you're drinking and want to be a big shot it'll take all of that out of you it'll humble you when you do that that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life that's right make you quit gossiping make you quit playing cards and shooting craps and all these other things that you do around the corner it'll make you quit carrying on that the way that you do living untrue to your wife that's what it'll do that's right it'll make you quit want to marry somebody else's wife that's exactly right he says and everybody said amen that's what it is it to make you live a holy life that's what the holy ghost power is for it's to set your affections on things above and not on the things of the world Amen can we say it makes you love the word of God it makes you love the stream if you can't come to church elderly amen but if you can't come to church you'll come to church it makes you do that it makes me get up in the morning and say oh Hallelujah this is Sunday

who he is he's the way maker he's the way maker he's the soul saer he's the sin forgiver my just think about it that's what this altar of Christ is for we have an altar we have a blood that we can go

the Lord see folks he'll take a soul that's down in a hole like a dog in a well barely being able to swim anymore hello and here comes a rescuer on his repelling gear ain't that right and he'll come down with that rope and he'll pick up that dog and he'll pick him up out the there when he was just about to perish that was you that was me just about to perish amen once my soul was astray from the Heavenly I was wretched and vile as could be but my savior above gave me peace joy and love when he reached down his hand for me aren't you glad there's somebody that'll show up if you'll call on him there's somebody that can show up this morning it don't matter what your problem is well I ain't got no problems well praise be to God I hope he came and fixed all your problems amen because we don't want problems but when we do get them we got somebody that we can call on amen that's right I was nearing despair when he came to me there amen and he showed me that I could be free then he lifted my feet he gave me Glory complete when he reached way down for me every one of us was in that hole how many knows that whenever there's a hero best heroic thing ain't that right the house is a blaze and a fireman comes and he breaks through the window goes in and saves a child and they bring him back down there and get it say here Mom here's your baby everybody goes yay to the hero and we sit and well I guess being saved is all right how many knows God is a hero and he is worthy of praise he is worthy of Glory he's worthy of honor why because he saved you he saved me he delivered me he delivered you he gave you peace joy and love when you had nothing but sorrow and despair when you're down and out he picks you up why because that's who he is that's what he does he allowed us to get to be a needy people so he could meet our need amen let me say here another one of my last notes amen everything that you have it's been given to you of him you ain't got nothing but what he's gave you nothing but what God has given you so why in the world you listen to brother Ron you listen to about any Minister out there and you're going to hear that they're preaching about worship you'll hear them talking of using this scripture of let everything that has breath why cuz even but bam said but in 1977 he said that he believed that by then he would have ushered in the millennium how many believes that we're getting close to it now we're getting close to the Rapture we're getting close to the time when all of Heaven amen there was a loud voice of worship saying glory and honor and power to him am me I feel like we're getting closer it's ushering in of the Rapture it's ushering in of a body change people time to claim every promise it's time to have no excuses amen I believe there's an ushering in coming close amen coming close I do believe we are getting so much closer that's what he came for didn't the Bible say ask ask knock seek all representing need is that right you don't ask for something unless you need something you don't seek something unless you need it you don't knock unless you want to get in ask abundantly how many BL we ought to ask abundantly we have a great big God Joshua didn't go with just a little bitt he ask he said Son stand still son I want to watch the replay time me I want to see I want to see if you just said Son stand still or if you said Son stand still moood keep your plate I don't know if there a lot of what either one works God hurt it and God heard a man God specialize it is stopping the universe if that's what need be you'll stop whatever I say stop the world stop the sun stop I don't know just what he stopped but it stopped isn't that right hard to Scientific explain just what happened but it happened god'll do it how many believes we need to have more faith in God I don't just want to say something I'm going to say it without permission amen if we had more faith for things a lot of these other things in our lives drop off all be dropping off even brother Brandon been preaching and it's what the Holy Ghost given for and he preached on makeup he preached on women and he preached on preachers that won't preach the gospel preachers that won't say what needs to be said and so forth doubting that he's called to be preached I mean to be called to preach to be preached that's what happens amen he says I wonder what kind of spirit's leading you that right Lord help us so I got wrote down here that's right everything that you have he give your ears so hear the Bible say let him that have ears let him hear that's what we come to God for he gave his ears no here hear what God says they gave you understanding how about trying to comprehend amen he gave you eyes to see so that you could see him oh I want to see him look upon his face amen look and live look to Jesus Christ and live he gave hands so that you could hold his word or so you could clap for him ain't that right he gave you feet so that you could follow in his steps or you could praise him with the dance he gave you legs and knees so you could give him let amen Praise Him in the dance he said Praise Him in this praise him up the loud symol but let me tell you most of all let's praise him with the way that we live let's Praise Him in the way that we dress the way that we act and most of all the character like we have the way that you talk don't be sloppy and slothful but in the way that you talk bring honor bring glory to him amen how many belever there this is is part of the response that I was telling you about when he does all this for you what do you do in return Ma I don't know about you but I go back to the one that saved me the one that resc me and he's got to great a great big hug I thank you ain't that right and that's what we do we come back and we give God worship we give him praise because he's worthy the Bible says give him the praise that is due to his name Christians ought to pay their dues amen pay their dues what is your due your due is to praise him for what he's done for you worship him for what he's done for you glorify him for what he's done for you amen I was Sinking Deep in sin far from the peaceful Shore amen oh my but aren't you glad that he Love Lifted Me Love Lifted Me Love Lifted Me when nothing else could help Love Lifted Me let me tell you something when he created the blood by his spoken word how many believe that the blood of God was spoken into existence when he spoke that because that's what's on that's what's at the altar folks if that blood wasn't there you could pray all you want to here or wherever your altar is it would never do any good but as long as that blood is on that altar the blood of almighty God let me tell you something there is power how many believe there's still Power in the Blood would you be free from sin your burden of sin your passion and pride there's power in the blood BL Power in the Blood there's Wonder working Power in the Blood folks I'm here to tell you if you're going to praise him you're going to have something to praise him about amen now I've got something to praise him about I've got something to worship him about I'm getting ready to be done with the trials done done with the tests done with Deliverance done with forgiveness hello done with mistakes hello all we're going to do through eternity is praise him for what he is and what he's done amen that's exactly right praise the Lord aren't you glad that he changes things that are invisible to visible by your faith my faith we're believing for a body change aren't we we're believing that we're going to see Jesus one of these days face to face we don't see Jesus now but we will how many believe one day we will physically see Jesus in the air amen our Invisibles will become visible that's why when you have a problem what do you do it doesn't matter how long it persists or what happen you know how many years brother Brandon suffered with this stomach trouble before he was healed I don't even know but it was many years many years imagine Paul great Apostle nobody closer to God than Paul at the time huh just like nobody closer than brother Brandon was in this hour ah brother berer watch yourself okay I'll watch myself when Miriam and Moses talked about not Miriam and Moses Miriam and Aaron talked about Moses and made in F of this he says you know if there's a prophet in the land I'm I'll dream I'll talk to people in dreams and this other I'll talk to other people but this guy here is different I talk to him lip to ear watch your mouth that's the way it is with the prophet of God Amen people better watch their mouth amen Lord help us what was I trying to say what I was trying to say was this great Apostle Paul sought for his eyesight and asked for healing woo God says you know my grace is sufficient for you amen my grace is sufficient for you because my strength is made perfect in your weakness and you wonder why God has to Humble us down you wonder why God has to break us down sometimes so that you'll actually be able to work through us so that his power can be seen through us it's not oh I did this and I did that you watch out you're going to get knocked down really good if you got a hearty and proud Spirit your story was God did this for me God did that for me I'm telling you it's about God not me God not you amen that's what he's for no matter what your problem is no matter what your problem is that's what God is for that's what he came for I didn't come to do for those who don't have need of a Healer I came for those who are sick brokenhearted the poor amen all right couple more quotes that all right now which one was we on that's right it's to make you live a holy life how many believes that's what God is for that's what the altar is for is to cause you to live holy every day not up and down in and out remember I preached I think Wednesday or time or two before talking about where are we we have to ask ourselves where we are in Christ we talked about going into the promised land some are still going around the mountains there's people Liv in a Justified state a Sanctified state but he says let's go into behind the CH Glory ain't that right go into the holies of holies and if you want to live if you want to know how where you're at Living listen to two sermons one is the inner Veil the other one is why are the people so tossed about brother brand clearly talks about a Sanctified person or a Justified person you know how they'll come to church y w that's right preacher and tomorrow they'll be all depressed and sad and everything else and all defeated by the time Monday comes around or Tuesday Amen brother Dar Ward Donnie Reagan or maybe brother somebody that you know Come Oh Glory we had a wonderful time I'm telling you but they don't even last till the next Revival butam says when there's somebody in the Holly of holies you don't have to go to church to get built up Lord help us how many would say Lord help me Brother John amen when I come in those double double doors help me to be built up already amen if you aren't that's okay we'll try to build you up here we'll try to fix you but it's better when you come in those double do built up already prayed up amen and if you aren't come on 30 minutes early that's what the 30 minutes early is for do you to get down on your knees and say God I Repent of any wrong God get me ready for this service don't let me sit there with an attitude or not get what the preacher's saying amen I'm preaching till my back's hurt brother Glenn I'm gonna I'm gonna take that I'm I'm gonna I found that where he talked about ministers being angels I found that he kept calling me an angel and I don't like to being call an angel but he says brother I don't care what you say you're an angel I am I'm an angel huh well all right amen I was going to read it Wednesday but I didn't want to go that long so I didn't but brother bam talked about he makes his ministers or his angels ministering Spirits amen ministering to the people the word of God Amen all right so when you come to church remember if it's under the anointing how many beli that be careful that's God speaking amen because I'm just a vessel I'm just a micro hello hello that's all I am is something that God talks through a microphone amen and you pray for me that I would be that amen because you know if I get in my flesh you will probably know it you can say amen I won't get too offended yeah that's right brother Joe just go to say amen that's right we know when you say something a little bit and usually when I get two little lacks of days eagle or something like that or get not serious enough it's it's very easy to do then amen so you have to keep keep your level of sincerity up amen otherwise you do stupid stuff amen Lord bless you God bless you amen all right holy life that's what the Holy Ghost is for sets your affections on things above let this mind be in you remember I said your God made your mind how many let it be programmed according to his mind amen he made your heart let him make his Abode there is that right everything about you your breath he gave you your breath he he gave me my lips not going to stick my tongue out but he gave me my tongue Amen to speak lips to praise the fruit of our lips giving praise how much do we do it amen most of all he gave you salvation he saved you well maybe that's kind of juvenile and and ABC is and Foundation is but I like it I'm glad he saved me because why that he also gave you that he gave you a reason to praise him he gave you a reason to worship him he even give you that give him a hand say thank you Lord Glory woo thank you Jesus amen I'm going to make it a little short today but I want to just a couple more I better not say that let me just read you a couple more would that be all right the Holy Ghost came to take all the starch out of you you know there's something about it I don't care it wasn't too long ago but I believe that when a preacher if we as ministers when we come up here we're not on the job or one thing we have to learn to do is just forget about your own abilities is that right and give yourself to God 100% mind Spirit soul and body did you ever notice it wasn't so long ago just about two weeks ago I seen brother Ron Spencer making some kind of an illustration

their crowns their Crown of Life how many believe you've been given a Crown of Life and you'll say God I wouldn't have no life it wasn't you fall down before him that's right that liveth forever and ever saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory honor power for thou H has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created amen another one and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels run about the throne and beasts and the elders and the number of them was 10 thousands times 10 thousands of thousands singing with a very quiet voice not with a loud voice Worthy is is a lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and glory and blessing and every creature John said type of the church and every creature the fish hurt me the whales hurt me

be unto him that Seth upon their Throne amen what's going to happen there's going to be a multitude of people amen saying with a loud voice glory honor power to the one that the lamb that was slain he's worthy cuz everything I have he has given me every breath every moment every everything even give the praise that I have he gave me because of what he has done for me amen well that's a different group some might say maybe it's so let's go to Revelations 19 brother Bram says that's the bride coming isin't that right amen listen to this and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah everybody say said Hallelujah get used to saying it is it melu seluja rujah hey folks when you get over there you're going to have it straight cuz we practiced over

for that's what God's for I believe that's what he's saying to anybody that's not where you ought to be in tune with God he's telling you you don't have to say that way that's why I died that's why I went to Calvary that's why I shed my blood so that you could have your need amen amen hallelujah for the Lord Our God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready amen Lord Jesus have us ready stand to your feet brother Joshua amen if you could come if you've got that song I'd like to sing that song I love that song Amen because H believes he is the way maker I don't know if we can pull any of that up yet or not but I think brother Josh might have do you have that brother Josh you got that okay how many thinks maybe just before we worship we should bow our heads and talk to the Lord Lord Jesus as we bow our heads Lord and father I've spoken Lord of how that even our thoughts can cause us to be disturbed it can bring spirits can make us upset but Lord when we're meditating on you as I have been this week Lord you lay little things like this on My Heart Lord it may be simple but Lord I realize and believe that it's really good it's really great to think of who you are what you are what you've done not what we are and what we have done when we think of why you have made a provision Lord for everything that we have need of Lord and for how great that you are Lord it makes me feel just as I have acted this morning under your anointing it makes us rejoice it makes us to have joy unspeakable and full of Glory makes us to have peace that passes understanding when we think on the right things when we keep our minds on you stayed on you changes us and I pray father for this congregation father this evening light Tabernacle my precious brothers and sisters who I've journeyed on a long way now father with we all know each other Lord and father I believe God that we're unifying like never before Lord so we have each other's backs Lord when one's down we all go to praying we pray right now Lord Jesus n father I pray father for each one and myself that you would cause us to be able to walk the way that you want us to walk to thank think the way that you want us to think to worship and to cause a worship in our hearts for what you have done in our lives and that you are doing every day and having this confidence that no matter what the future holds we know that you're going to lead us to yourself to a Rapture to a heaven to a millennium to be with you forever and ever and ever and we realize it's going to be beyond anything that what we can imagine but we pray pray father this morning that you would hear that you would bless each one that hears this this morning Father we walk with you and a preparation in their hearts to be ready father when you come Lord when we think of our politics the world that we're living in and how it's going and when the world is anticipating perhaps for Trump to win and things to get better Lord maybe it will but I thought Lord that would be a perfect time when everybody thinks it'll be a little longer and then there you are you come when people aren't expecting it but Lord I pray that everybody here no matter what happens what comes or goes but that they would be expecting you to come before tonight is over with before tomorrow morning every day looking for your coming for our eyes want to behold you we want to be with you Lord Jesus we want to see you face to face and all the saints of all the ages and the dream that we have a father of seeing that Rapture and that great parade as your Prophet described it Paul's group coming up Aria's group all those Saints of all the ages coming and taking to the skies whoa what a time it will be Lord what a time that will be and that's what our vision is that which we don't see yet we're expecting it to become materialized we ask God that you would continue Lord Jesus with me with Brother Brad any Minister that comes and preaches across this Pulpit father that they would be anointed by your spirit to bring your people to a Readiness so father that they wouldn't fulfill the part of the servant that said my Lord delays is coming and they were slack they knew they weren't what they were supposed to be but they never changed God don't let anybody be here like that father we ask God that you would change us daily hourly as we allow your word to take preeminence in our lives forgive us as I rais my hands we raise our hands Lord forgive us of any failures Lord and where we're not what we ought to be God and still need a closer walk with you you see us you see our hearts we ask God that you make us white in the blood of the Lamb for you are worthy Lord Jesus and we give you praise in the name of Jesus Christ we ask these things amen and amen God bless you amen you love the Lord do you love one another amen God bless you Church brother
