she'll once again come to the house of God and Lord be able to put her ear beds buds on and listen to the preaching of the Gospel Lord as she has been faithful in your house Lord we ask God that you'll be faithful to her and touch her this morning Lord raise her back up Lord Jesus and bring her back amongst us Lord father we ask these blessings in your name for this service also this morning we ask God that you'd help me just to get out of the way Lord that you would use my lips father to speak to the needs of the people this morning Lord Jesus you know what each and every one of us has need of and we ask God that you would just look at that need and minister to that need and may you grant faith in every heart Lord this morning to be able to receive what they have need of Lord that they might go from here Lord having their needs filled this morning Lord we thank you Lord for this day and ask your blessing upon it now help us now as we open your word we ask God that you would open the understanding of the scriptures to us Lord in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen and amen and everybody said praise the Lord amen God bless you let's give the Lord a hand say thank you Lord Jesus Praise Your Name Lord amen amen God bless you this morning it's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord and amen to see amen as many here as we have on this amen Christmas Eve amen knowing there's a lot of them different ones that travel to go see their families but amen I'm so glad that I'm a part of the family of God God amen amen join HS with Jesus amen so God bless you good to see everybody kind of TI the middle I like the middle a little more fool than the sides amen and so I like that amen praise the Lord so it's just good to see everybody this morning and good to be in the house of the Lord and feel good amen and so the Lord's just dropped a little very simple thought once again in my heart kind of like he did Wednesday amen Amen on Reliance speak speaking on Reliance and amen I kind of felt bad talking about us being stupid and and dumb and so forth and and uh then I was listening to brother brandom and he says you know and he says something about who' have thought a bunch of nitwits like us I'm like well he called us nitwit so I guess I'm not too far off amen but amen I she just glad to have God with you amen as long as you know I I I'll tell you what I want to I want to be whatever they want us to be knit with or whatever but I don't want to be well like what they are ain't that right cuz they're certainly crazy as far as I'm concerned amen amen and so we just thank God for his grace amen amen praise the Lord so this morning amen I I didn't pull a quote up but brother bam was fixing the preach and he says you know not just be calm he says and don't get excited he says faith doesn't get excited Jesus never got excited I heard him saying about just you know don't get all excited and I'm like wow I like to get excited but maybe some sometimes we need just just take it calmly and let the Holy Spirit just move in a calm amen realm amen now don't let me say that too much and everybody be all quiet and sleeping on me this morning but amen God bless you amen praise the Lord amen so I want to read a few scriptures before I actually tell you my title amen it is certainly a simple one but we've prayed so let me get my Bible here and we will amen um turn if you will with me and we'll go to the Book of Revelations amen I I wanted to kind of get away from this thought am mean this thought kind of come to me and I begin to think about it I said no I've preached on that before where am I going to go with that you know and and you know my flesh perhaps but the Lord just brought it back amen and so how many knows whatever the Lord wants that's what we want amen whatever the Holy Spirit wants to bring to us amen and so amen I and and certainly don't feel I'm a deep preacher but amen if I can just preach the simple things God lays on my heart amen I think it'll be a blessing to us amen Revelations 3 amen I just want to say that our heart really goes out to Sister Mildred I think everybody understands you know uh you know they didn't want to suppose some things but I will say that um what did H say her pelvis I think was broken you know and a couple she needs surgery on some vertebraes in the back of her neck amen but they haven't take haven't done it because uh of her age amen and so they they're just kind of looking at things and watching things right now amen and then of course they bleeding on the brain and so we know that it's I mean it's serious so we just pray that amen uh the great God the great physician would come on the scene amen and touch our sister amen it's quite something I thought you know how Wednesday I talked about how unrel ible life is that we have no promise of even making it home and you know you know she could have been taken amen and and and it's just so true isn't it and it could have been her or any one of us if uh if God call you home amen we're going to go home amen but you know I trust that you know I think as far as I know most of her body and her heart and blood pressure and everything is in good shape amen her eyesight may not be the best amen amen she was pulled out in front of a few people here the last couple of weeks amen but just pray if it's not her time that God will spare her and give her good life amen amen they did say that she was moving her hands and her feet amen so it doesn't look from what my point of view from what I understand she's not paralyzed like from the neck down or anything so but they're keeping her sedated you know because they're watching the bleeding on the brain and see where it goes and see if they'll have to release pressure or kind of watching it amen but our heart goes out to her amen and we know that God is with her amen Revelations 3 a very familiar scripture this morning amen and uh we'll begin with verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I consel Thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint and eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see you can be seated may God add His blessings to the reading of the word amen amen in Philippians the last chapter I think it's verse chapter five I think maybe chapter only has four chapters four and verse 9 19 Paul says it this way he says but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Jesus Christ amen and the word that came to me amen was that simple little word of need amen need amen so I going to talk about being needy and I titled it amen my God shall supply all all your needs amen how many believe that God has promised to do that amen and we are certainly a needy people amen amen and so um a needy people says it this way he says you know you said before you're going away whatever that two or three Whenever two or three are gathered in my name there you'd be in their midst and if they shall agree on any single thing as touching one thing ask and you shall receive Lord to bring your promise to this the purchase of thy blood man woman or child that rais their hands tonight that you know their heart may they receive what they're asking for granted Lord amen I wonder how many tonight or this morning our needy people how many has a has a need this morning amen need think about that need amen so he said as granted Lord we are a needy people we are a needy people we know that from the very creation amen from the very start God allowed us to become that way to be needy amen but brah says we're are very needy people we're walking in a dark world with a great enemy of ours of yours that we cannot combat with him at all if it wasn't for your Holy Spirit therefore we are one trusting we are two believing and number three we're acting in faith that he'll go before us and make the way clearer amen amen I like what Paul said my God shall supply how many's glad this morning to have a God that supplies we have the greatest Supply lying God upon the face of the Earth amen for everyone we are and I want to mention some of them because we've got a lot of need Humanity a human being amen has a lot of needs and you will always have a lot of needs you will always be needy amen now notice I like this let me just finish this quote and he'll go before us make a way clear so many pitfalls along the the road set for our weary feet but we are trying to follow the bloody Footprints of him who ha overcome death hell and the grave guide us amen tonight by thy holy spirit amen I wanted to recap a little bit on Wednesday we talked about how that God had made man and in in man they found in I guess in scientists found that in the human heart there's a compartment amen that the animals don't have Amen brother brandom said that's the place of the Soul the place amen of the control tower amen how many know that as long as there's a void there man and if it's a control tower it's what guides you it's the place of guiding man like I said Wednesday we're we're we're we're dependant amen upon God Amen to lead us we're Reliant upon God to lead us and guide us human beings were never made to guide themselves never made to lead themselves we weren't made that way you were made to be guided and oh I hope this goes down deep but I'm here to tell you outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost In Your Heart you'll never really even be able to think the right [Applause] thoughts so that's how misguided you're going to be if you don't have the Holy Ghost amen reminded me of a message butam C talked about why the Holy Spirit why is there such a he says there's such a great need why the Holy Spirit there's such a must for the Holy Ghost amen but amen so just recapping that a little bit talking about guiding us and leading us but tonight amen amen or today is it after no it's not after 12 so it's not tonight yet but today we want to talk a little bit about how that we were made to be Reliant made to be led we're made needy we were created with a lot of needs with a lot of needs amen guide us tonight by thy Holy Spirit Lord to the words that should be said then guide the words to the heart that is needy of them amen then Lord May at the end of the meeting and I'm praying how many believe it's the same yesterday today and forever may that be this morning Lord help me to say something that would Minister to a need of the heart that is needy amen May at the end of the service or the meeting uh and we start our to our different homes may we be able to say again like those coming from EMAs did not our hearts burn within us as he's talked to us along the way aren't you glad that Jesus walk to you along the way just like he did what are they called the three disciples on the road to EMAs that's right as he talked to them he can talk to us this morning amen we're such a blessed people amen we're so blessed remember the this is going down a little rubber Trail but remember in the Old Testament the the prophets would be so blessed that if they died and was buried they could put a man on it on it the anointing would be there so much until people raised from the just by putting them on their graves why because everything they touched is blessed and how many believe that's for the Christian that's for you that's for me Everything You Touch everything you do is bless your children are blessed to have parents that are Godly amen your neighbors are blessed to have you in the community amen we're blessed this morning to have you here how many is glad to be blessed by God go to our different homes all right amen now notice also here he says brother brah says I wonder before we pray if there's anyone here that has special requests for prayer if you just let it be known by an uplifted hand God's ease now you see whether we're needy in a needy world or not Brethren I guess 95 or 98% of the audience lifted their hands confess they were needy they had needs amen and will also will always be needy now I like and I've preached a me several messages on us and I'm going to preach a little bit on it this morning but God is here to fill that need he's here to supply that need amen but will always be needy be never a time never a time in this life but that you can say I ain't got nothing no need huh no not as long because why how many knows you may have you may be perfectly in fellowship with the father Spirit ain't that right amen this flesh is still here we have need of being delivered from this house until we get delivered from this you're always going to have needs you'll always be needy until you get over the other side what I read reason that I read that over in Revelations the third chapter is because he that group remember they said they said they had need [Applause] of nothing that's right they had need of nothing and I want to say I want to say this that I believe the day will come when you and I will be able to see say I ain't got no needing nothing thank you hard to understand ain't it sah where in the world now let me ask one question and you'll be able to answer it where will that be on the other side you won't be need the over you won't need healing you won't need salvation you w't woo come on people think about it when we get over there we'll be able to say I don't need nothing I've got everything out but not until over there so they had a I believe I didn't go back and search it but the BR I believe one of the church agees somewhere he says you know when they said they had need of nothing in other words they're saying that we have arrived we've got what we need we don't need anymore they have arrived well uh that's not the way God saw it was it that's certainly not the way God saw it and tonight we come again Lord as a needy people for we are ever in need of thee as long as we're here on Earth we know that'll be the cry for we are in a battle that battle is Raging as long as we are in Earth there'll be the cry Lord I have need cuz tomorrow you'll have another battle come tomorrow you'll have more sickness come tomorrow you'll have more mind battles tomorrow you'll have something else am man oh my think about it you'll have need of Victory all the way to the end so needs amen it's okay to be needy amen why God made us that way why he could Supply our need why would a why would a Shepherd go and break the Little Lamb's leg why in the world would you be so cruel as to break the Little Lamb's leg well maybe it kept straying maybe it kept straying and it just wouldn't stay home and so he broke its leg so that he could give it some special attention more time there and it would clean closer to the master he has a purpose in it all don't he amen and god let's getting great needs he let Israel get into a need when he put him down there on the Red Sea amen trap couldn't go nowhere we got a need they had a bad need but how many know if God wanted to make way how many believe that we have got the greatest way maker that ever was I don't care what it is he is our way maker he is our supplier he is our provider and he didn't come and he didn't he's not going to leave you amen with 95% of your needs supplied no Paul said I he will all your needs we have untapped resources but let me tell you something we are tapped into the uh The Fountain the inexhaustible Fountain of Life that's what you and I are tapped into Lord help us to comprehended he promised anything that you need anything and boy have we got some need man where would we start right amen sure be nice to be able to say I don't need nothing but we can't say that until we get over there but these lay out of sins they thought they didn't need anything now how can you help a person that doesn't need anything can you help a person that don't need nothing no huh well you give me let me give you some advice shut up I don't want your advice I don't need you your advice can you give a person advice like that no you can't give them advice you can't give them anything when they feel like they've already got it they've already arrived but God thought a little bit different the Bible says that they were wretched no it's not you were lukewarm the Bible said they were lukewarm can we tie something together does lukewarmness come with you thinking you're okay I'm not lukewarm I'm just fine the way I am that's a good lukewarm attitude a but a real genuine Holy Ghost person realize that I got God but I still need more of God there's a deep calling and if that's a deep calling there's a deep to respond if you have a walk desire for a deeper walk with God there's a deeper walk with God to be had if you want to be more like Christ there's a closer walk to be had but if you're fine you stay like you are and I don't know about you but I don't want to stay like I am why because I'm still not in the stature of the perfect image of Christ are you how many know we still have need of patience we still have need of temperance we still have need of these things amen we can't say well I'm live no we're going to be growing until the day that we leave this earth we're going to need more more what did Brother B say about that older couple head says you know what is their desire more like him more of him that's right lukewarm they were thought they were okay amen no and what were they wretched I didn't bring my phone out here but it was pitiful poor in a bad State that's what the interpretation is in a real bad place wretched miserable is that what we're living in we're living in a world that's miserable poor not rich yeah they were Rich huh and you got a what rich is when you got riches and you got everything you need then you get LAX you think well I got everything I want everything I need huh better be careful huh make you lazy those Saints and and so forth that didn't have no didn't know where the next meal was coming from amen they were more relying on God we get downi and we get LAX of days ago we get lukewarm and amen amen praise the Lord they hadn't arrived we haven't arrived we still have great needs amen think about it we still have need of a Perfection how many knows brother Bram says he says a real Christian hungers and thirsts for perfection you hate every little flaw about yourself how many hands do we have up I hate every little flaw about myself how many doesn't have any flaws brother GL he [Applause] went I like that brother woo Glory that's a trick question but that's the truth a it that's right because we still flawed going to be FL but says that Perfection is not on this side this what he he says we thirst for it we long for it and you might be strong Christian but even brother R right up to the end he would make mistakes even said we backslide every day he said why CU as long as you're in this flesh this flesh trips you up this flesh says things it shouldn't say it thinks it's things it shouldn't think amen it says things that hurt other people's feelings that's right y'all some of y'all know I've said things right up here that hurt your little feelings didn't it oh yeah I do sometimes but what do you got to do let's vote in a new one well you could do that but or you could forgive me realize you're not quite perfect yourself amen one thing's for sure Thomas B is never going to stand up here and sit up here and be oh I better watch what I say oh I better not hurt nobody's feelings I'd be a fasty case folks no I like to just try to yield myself to the Holy Spirit as much as possible and try to say Les huh while we're preaching on me let's preach on me amen you know because I still say things that I think about later I wish I kind of wouldn't have said that huh I still I'm still up there I still make mistakes but my heart's desires Lord help me to speak things that only the Holy Spirit would speak and help Thomas berer and his mouth to stay shut a little more up here ain't that right right that's me that's right Lord help me say only things that the Holy Spirit once said amen and that sometimes because sometimes we get a little bit jokey a little so oh be careful amen I was thinking you know you want to get closer to God you're going to have to be more sincere amen so praise the Lord all right enough preaching on me amen but I need it I'll take it if the Lord shows me H you know how many believes I got to take correction the Holy Spirit corrects me amen and and I'm hoping that you will really pray Paul pray for Thomas that he'll listen you know he'll catch it when the holy spirit's correcting him amen cuz he Thomas B don't need to be correcting Paul if he won't take correction that's right we all have to take correction amen it work working towards that Perfection amen when we get over to the other side huh no more mistakes no more oops no more I'm sorry I said that no more repentance you'll never have to repent huh why because you won't do anything wrong think about that amen praise the Lord listen overy we won't have any sugar problems no high blood pressure we won't have no car accidents huh going be none of that no getting old glory to God you said well I don't have a whole lot of need just get a little older let's get a little older now you'll realize said hey I need energy how many of how many of needs

believe to be a Son of God you got to walk in the spirit walk in the spirit and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen that's the truth the Holy Spirit burning it out thank God for providing us with peace of mind because we needed peace because that world ain't got no peace of mind aren't you glad that you don't have to have the trans debate you don't have to have all of that debate

heard brother I was listening to him yesterday says what do we care about atomic bombs what we care about what all these things are he says we ain't got to worry about that he says before the first one is we'll be gone the believer ain't got to worry about it oh my isn't it weird how China and America Russia I guess China and America now talking about they want to kind of see who has some more Superior Fighters I had to think God says man if you're relying on the strength of a horse to deliver you you're not too smart don't rely on the SE strength they're relying on their own strength Bel Jer and them remember they were the strongest of the Nations they thought they couldn't be conquered that doesn't mean nothing don't rely on the strength of your own self I'm not relying on my own ability today I'm just relying on God to lead you to guide you amen thank you Lord Jesus the Lord amen but I just want to say this again amen I really like this what he said he said many times talking about when you have the Holy Ghost when you've got the spirit of God on the ins everything that you have need of is in you then oh wow well but remember he didn't say it was just in you but it was like a tree that's planted you have to water it you have to push out healing you have to push out Deliverance you have to push it out by by what by watering it I mean those our spiritual walk with God
