[41:23] his eagle
[41:32] ezekiel
[41:44] i'm sorry
[41:46] it's not ezekiel
[41:50] it's zachariah amen zachariah
[41:57] that is one of my scriptures that i have
[42:05] and zechariah
[42:07] wasn't even marked in my tabs so i had a
[42:10] real hard time finding it
[42:13] there's zechariah okay yeah just before
[42:15] malachi
[42:17] amen
[42:19] zechariah
[42:20] the 12th chapter
[42:28] just one scripture there
[42:32] one verse
[42:34] it says
[42:35] the burden of the word of
[42:37] israel saith the lord which stretches
[42:40] forth the heavens
[42:41] and layeth the foundations of the earth
[42:43] that formeth the spirit of man within
[42:45] him
[42:46] and then we want to go over to
[42:49] luke
[42:50] the book of luke the 12th chapter
[42:54] luke 12.
[43:03] and we'll begin with
[43:13] verse 41 then peter says unto him lord
[43:16] speakest thou this parable unto us
[43:18] or even to all and the lord said who
[43:20] then is that faithful and wise servant
[43:24] steward
[43:25] whom his lord hath
[43:26] shall make ruler over his household
[43:30] to give them their portion of meat in
[43:32] due season blessed is that servant whose
[43:36] whom his lord when he cometh shall find
[43:38] so doing
[43:39] of a truth i say unto you that he will
[43:41] make him ruler over all that he hath
[43:44] but and if that servant say in his heart
[43:46] my lord delayeth his coming and shall
[43:48] begin to beat them to men servants
[43:50] maidservants
[43:51] and to eat and to drink
[43:53] and to be drunken the lord of that
[43:56] servant will come in a day when he
[43:58] looketh not for him
[43:59] and at an hour when he is not aware and
[44:02] will cut him asunder and will appoint
[44:04] him his portion with the unbelievers and
[44:08] that servant which knew his lord's will
[44:10] and prepared not himself neither did
[44:12] according to his will
[44:14] shall be beaten with many stripes
[44:18] but he that knew not and did commit
[44:20] things worthy of stripes shall be beaten
[44:22] with few stripes
[44:24] now here's my point
[44:26] for unto whomsoever
[44:29] much is given
[44:31] of him shall be much required
[44:34] and to whom men shall have committed
[44:36] much
[44:37] of him they will ask the more amen
[44:41] may god add his blessings to the reading
[44:42] of the word
[44:44] amen my title is the burden of the word
[44:46] of the lord amen the burden of the word
[44:49] of the lord
[44:51] amen
[44:52] and i was just thinking and how that
[44:55] uh you know
[44:57] we love to enjoy the peace of god that
[45:00] passes understanding
[45:03] amen the joy that is unspeakable and
[45:05] full of glory amen
[45:08] uh we love that jesus came and he says
[45:10] and you know that come unto me all ye
[45:12] who are weary and heavy laden and i will
[45:15] give you rest
[45:16] amen for my burden is easy and my uh my
[45:20] yoke is easy i believe he said and my
[45:22] burden is light amen
[45:25] so tonight we want to talk about burden
[45:27] with the help of the lord for just a
[45:28] little talk about burden amen of course
[45:32] uh burden is a weight amen something
[45:35] that perhaps weighs you down or uh
[45:38] i i think of it as a responsibility amen
[45:41] that has been given
[45:42] amen and man of course
[45:45] you know on the on many many different
[45:47] ways we can look at burden and in the
[45:49] aspect of life itself amen
[45:52] you know you're born in sin shaped with
[45:55] iniquity come into this world speaking
[45:57] lies and we know that life itself from
[46:00] the beginning to the end is a burden
[46:04] amen
[46:05] it's hard never was geared just to be
[46:08] easy and it's a burden it's a
[46:10] responsibility
[46:11] amen
[46:12] and it's never easy but you know there's
[46:14] so many different things and amen and
[46:17] it's and then there's the burden of sin
[46:20] amen the burden of condemnation
[46:23] amen the burden of guilt
[46:26] all these things weigh you down and it
[46:28] reminds me a little of pilgrim's
[46:29] progress remember the big backpack
[46:32] and this heavy weight that he had and he
[46:33] carried it everywhere and
[46:35] man his purpose was to get rid of that
[46:37] weight
[46:38] get rid of that burden you know
[46:41] and it wasn't until he met christ that
[46:43] he could take that load off
[46:45] and he made him be free
[46:47] praise god how many knows that's the way
[46:49] it is with every person that comes into
[46:51] this world
[46:53] amen you've got to wait on you you know
[46:55] and that's why people go crazy
[46:58] that's why there's just it's just so
[47:00] much weight
[47:01] amen just to wait many times just a
[47:03] weight of having to try to keep up with
[47:06] things and
[47:07] paying your rent if you know
[47:09] uh paying your car payment but the
[47:11] insurance all of this weight
[47:13] on top of
[47:15] amen having something in here that
[47:17] people are trying to satisfy with
[47:19] everything that they do
[47:20] they try to lift that weight a little
[47:22] bit we know that drinking and all of
[47:24] that drugs that people do they're just
[47:26] trying to get rid of the weight
[47:28] they're trying to get rid of the burden
[47:29] that's on them
[47:32] because it's a heavy weight it's a heavy
[47:34] burden
[47:35] people put their gun to their head and
[47:38] pull the trigger because they want they
[47:39] want to get rid of the weight they
[47:40] taught it can't do it anymore
[47:42] it's a heavy burden
[47:45] just comes that song you know we were
[47:48] shackled with a heavy burden
[47:50] neath the load of guilt and shame and so
[47:53] forth but then the hand of jesus touched
[47:56] me now i am no longer the same
[48:00] praise god how many knows that when you
[48:02] got a load when you're carrying a lot
[48:04] it's hard to be happy
[48:07] it's hard to have joy
[48:09] it's hard to be free
[48:11] that's why you find so many people amen
[48:14] that they do not have the joy they do
[48:16] not have peace they have a frown and not
[48:18] a smile because they don't know the
[48:21] peace that passes under they don't know
[48:22] this
[48:25] amen
[48:26] but we find also that a christian
[48:28] christians after you get the holy ghost
[48:31] after you have the joy after that burden
[48:33] is gone then there's another burden that
[48:36] we have
[48:37] huh
[48:39] you're not done with burden
[48:43] you're not done with being heavy you're
[48:45] not done with all of that
[48:46] now it goes into a different aspect
[48:49] because i want you to know that just
[48:50] because you're completely free just
[48:53] because you completely have the joy of
[48:55] god and the peace of god in your heart
[48:58] you're still not free from
[48:59] responsibility
[49:02] amen
[49:03] amen because one just one little thing
[49:06] that you know jesus said you the first
[49:08] bible says that he is the light of all
[49:10] jesus is the light of the world but then
[49:12] jesus says you
[49:14] now you're going to be the light of the
[49:16] world
[49:19] you're going to be a christian he called
[49:21] you to be the light of the world
[49:24] praise be to god that's the
[49:26] responsibility
[49:28] amen
[49:30] you become a steward you become a
[49:32] servant
[49:34] to the lord how many knows i don't care
[49:36] who you are who you serve if you are a
[49:38] servant you're you're a slave to
[49:40] somebody
[49:41] you're somebody's slave
[49:44] and we know that you and i have been
[49:46] bought
[49:48] huh
[49:49] we went up to that auction block so to
[49:51] speak
[49:52] isn't that right and we got sold
[49:56] you got to get sold you're going to get
[49:58] sold you're going to you're going to be
[50:00] somebody's slave you're going to be
[50:01] somebody's servant
[50:05] let me know jesus said you can't you
[50:06] know you're going to serve one master or
[50:08] the other
[50:09] you have a master that you're going to
[50:11] serve and that becomes a weight
[50:14] amen
[50:16] it becomes a burden
[50:18] or a weight that we feel
[50:20] i was looking at this weight i was
[50:22] looking at this burden and looking at
[50:24] these things and brother baby says you
[50:26] should be in the meetings and feel
[50:28] people wait
[50:29] and and see how what a burden is for a
[50:31] minister amen because he's responsible
[50:34] whether that is a successful meeting or
[50:36] whether it's not a successful meeting
[50:40] and he talked about those that were
[50:41] giving out prayer cards and even his
[50:43] lois his sister-in-law i guess he called
[50:46] it was and he talked about how that she
[50:48] was doing things and trying to keep up
[50:49] and she had to take two days off he said
[50:52] just lay in the bed
[50:54] because the weight of it because the
[50:56] burden of it he said billy paul giving
[50:57] out prayer cards and this one once said
[51:00] maybe he'll try to pay your money for it
[51:01] he'll try anyway and he's got to keep it
[51:03] all straight no this ain't right he you
[51:06] know and yeah you get the prayer card
[51:08] but you don't well that one may be in a
[51:09] wheelchair and this one doesn't have
[51:11] anything available all of the
[51:12] responsibility all that weighs on them
[51:14] and they brother man says man it's it's
[51:16] something else
[51:18] gotta have a break from it
[51:20] amen
[51:22] but the burden so we see here and we
[51:24] think about it we think about the burden
[51:27] of the word of the lord how many knows
[51:29] how the bible says that to whom much is
[51:31] forgiven
[51:34] there's our weight already there's our
[51:36] burden to them much will be required
[51:43] how many believes message believers are
[51:46] going to be required a lot of
[51:48] you and i
[51:49] required a lot of of what we do
[51:53] with what has been given us
[51:58] and according to the scripture that we
[52:00] have read it's very
[52:02] important
[52:04] because even jesus says you know he gave
[52:06] one a certain talent give another
[52:07] certain talent give another certain
[52:09] talent
[52:10] what did you do with it
[52:13] any one of us knows that you've been a
[52:14] christian in a while
[52:16] amen you look back at your christian
[52:18] life and you look at what you did with
[52:19] your christian life
[52:21] what did you do what did you accomplish
[52:26] one place brother bam says how many
[52:28] souls have you brought to christ
[52:30] i mean he says if you haven't brought an
[52:32] event he says then you're guilty
[52:35] you're guilty
[52:37] of being unprofitable
[52:40] because the purpose is lost souls
[52:43] amen
[52:44] amen all right let's look at this for a
[52:47] little bit
[52:49] but says you know
[52:51] would you like to know what i think the
[52:53] greatest need of the church is today
[52:55] where i think the lacking is
[52:58] he says is there's no travail
[53:01] the people are not broke up enough
[53:03] he says there's no burden
[53:08] no burden
[53:12] seemingly he says you give me someone
[53:15] that's just so tore up about lost souls
[53:18] that they cry and they're wanting a
[53:19] revival so bad till they can't hardly
[53:21] eat and so forth
[53:23] amen
[53:25] if you'll read the history of the world
[53:27] religious history you'll find out it's
[53:28] always taking that kind of a spirit to
[53:30] bring a revival
[53:33] you know i just thought about travail
[53:34] how many knows that the travail of soul
[53:37] when zion is in travail she brought
[53:40] forth
[53:42] i don't care if you're working it takes
[53:45] travel of working to get something done
[53:48] amen and if you want something from god
[53:50] it takes travail it takes travail
[53:53] travailing
[53:55] a burden
[53:56] a desire to have you won't get nowhere
[53:58] if you ain't got no desire to get
[54:00] somewhere
[54:02] that's what he says that's the problem
[54:04] people have no burden anymore
[54:07] they're just
[54:08] laxatical
[54:10] oh brother brandon best describes it let
[54:12] me go on
[54:13] now look he says if this church
[54:16] if i'd say this morning in this little
[54:18] group of people here god would say now
[54:20] look william brown i'm going to make you
[54:21] answer for that group of people
[54:23] what you tell them
[54:25] now do you want them all to shout i say
[54:27] sure i want them all to shout
[54:30] amen do you want them all to speak in
[54:32] tongues yeah i want every one of them
[54:34] to do you want to them to answer the
[54:36] spirit yes i want every one of you to
[54:38] dance in the spirit
[54:41] all right well that's very good but what
[54:43] would you rather have them do
[54:45] but i says i'd rather have a church that
[54:47] had such a burden
[54:54] such a burden on their hearts for prayer
[54:56] that they just stayed at the altar and
[54:58] would be there day and night
[55:03] wouldn't it be something if we just
[55:05] have to tell the deacons look there's
[55:07] people praying here and
[55:09] and we're already at 9 30 and they're
[55:11] gonna keep on praying
[55:14] huh we're just gonna leave the doors
[55:16] open and everybody goes home that wants
[55:17] to and let them lock it up
[55:21] maybe they'd stay all night
[55:24] can you imagine
[55:26] we've never seen something like that
[55:27] have we
[55:29] but they used to do it
[55:31] they used to could pray all night
[55:34] amen a burden on their heart for prayer
[55:38] day and night and everything else and in
[55:39] their house was constantly in prayer and
[55:42] humble and trying to get people to come
[55:44] to god
[55:46] amen how many of you that's a it's like
[55:49] a fire that's in there in your soul
[55:52] once you once the once the word comes
[55:55] into here it becomes the burden
[55:59] how do you know you don't lose your joy
[56:01] you don't lose your peace but there's
[56:03] something different there's another
[56:04] party that's a burden
[56:07] that's heavy
[56:08] [Applause]
[56:11] what is that
[56:14] this kind of come to me as i was sitting
[56:15] there
[56:17] listening to brother luke
[56:19] and i was thinking you know
[56:21] we should feel
[56:23] like jesus felt
[56:26] because how many knows god give us these
[56:27] feelings
[56:29] and there to be in the right place
[56:32] how did jesus feel
[56:35] amen
[56:38] how many knows that jesus was god
[56:40] himself there's nobody had peace like he
[56:41] did
[56:42] he says my peace i give unto you so he
[56:44] had peace to give
[56:46] he had the very peace of god
[56:48] he had the very joy of god
[56:51] but yet he had the burden of the whole
[56:53] world upon him
[56:55] [Applause]
[56:56] and it was a heavy burden a burden that
[56:59] you and i don't have to bear
[57:00] [Music]
[57:01] he had done he knew he had to go to that
[57:03] cross and every man's sin every
[57:06] everybody was on him he wasn't just
[57:08] pastoring a church he was pastoring the
[57:11] whole world he was responsible for
[57:13] everybody
[57:15] and it wasn't easy
[57:19] no
[57:21] even though he had
[57:23] peace in his heart and so forth
[57:26] yet the bible says that
[57:28] he is despised and rejected of men
[57:31] he was a man of sorrows
[57:33] and acquainted with grief
[57:38] how many knows that's a christian
[57:40] now remember
[57:42] if the life of god is in you that's the
[57:44] things you'll experience
[57:50] amen
[57:52] acquainted with grace it reminds me of
[57:55] wherever bam says you know he says man i
[57:57] tell you what i have been cut deep many
[58:02] times
[58:04] deep many times
[58:08] sure
[58:09] keeping cut knee brother man says man
[58:11] sometimes you have no idea what goes
[58:13] with this type of ministry why in the
[58:14] world would somebody desire to be a
[58:16] prophet
[58:17] you have any idea the weight that he
[58:19] carried
[58:22] responsibility that he had
[58:25] now it just comes to me now
[58:28] but
[58:28] acquainted with grief and sorrows
[58:31] brother bannon he loved people he tried
[58:33] to get everybody he with the ministry
[58:36] that he had
[58:37] he says i've won two thousand so two
[58:39] million souls he says and i should have
[58:41] won many more with the
[58:44] ministry that god gave
[58:47] see ministry is mean to minister to to
[58:49] give out
[58:50] with what he had given him he should
[58:52] have won a lot more
[58:54] because why that discernment and christ
[58:56] coming down and man he should add more
[59:00] and he's one at one point in his life as
[59:02] you know he came to where he was
[59:03] disappointed in people
[59:06] he loved people so much he cared so much
[59:10] because that's what a christian does
[59:11] they care
[59:12] how many knows it hurts to care
[59:15] because that care will be trampled on
[59:18] it'll be thrown back in your face
[59:21] and everything else that care will
[59:25] amen
[59:26] and he cared and he got discouraged well
[59:28] if that's how they're going to be i'm
[59:29] just going to the mountain and so forth
[59:31] and he had to regain that love
[59:34] and he had to come to a realization the
[59:36] one thing that he came to a realization
[59:37] is that not everybody's predestinated to
[59:40] receive it
[59:42] he came to place look i can't i can't go
[59:44] crazy
[59:46] because people won't come
[59:49] i can't i can't do that i have to just
[59:51] realize that all of that is in god's
[59:53] hand my responsibility is just to preach
[59:55] the gospel
[59:57] and at the end when he didn't have but a
[59:59] couple of open doors to go to it didn't
[1:00:01] make any difference he stayed with the
[1:00:02] word of god
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:07] my
[1:00:08] so he knew he knew what the pain was he
[1:00:10] knew what a burden was
[1:00:12] the burden of a christian life
[1:00:14] the burden of the word of the lord
[1:00:17] responsibility that comes with it
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:23] so christ it says that he was acquainted
[1:00:26] with grief we hid our faces as it were
[1:00:28] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[1:00:31] them not surely he had borne our griefs
[1:00:34] and carried our sorrows
[1:00:36] yet we did assume him stricken smitten
[1:00:38] of god and afflicted he was wounded for
[1:00:42] our transgression he was bruised for our
[1:00:44] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:00:46] was upon him and with his stripes
[1:00:48] we are healed
[1:00:51] praise the lord it says verse seven he
[1:00:53] was oppressed he was afflicted yet
[1:00:56] opened need out his mouth
[1:00:58] how many knows he came to his own and
[1:01:00] his own received him not no matter how
[1:01:02] many times he rejected him he kept
[1:01:04] loving him so much he was trying his
[1:01:06] best
[1:01:08] to get him saved he was trying to try
[1:01:10] his best
[1:01:11] until he was outside of jerusalem and
[1:01:13] the bible says he wept didn't he
[1:01:16] he wept your jerusalem jerusalem
[1:01:21] how i would have hovered you at the end
[1:01:23] of the brew but you would not
[1:01:28] huh
[1:01:30] paul had such a burden he had that same
[1:01:32] life of christ until he says i wish
[1:01:34] myself a curse for my brother's
[1:01:36] sake huh he had so much of a love for
[1:01:39] him
[1:01:40] how many times he would stand out there
[1:01:42] on the temple
[1:01:44] doors and on the entryways of places
[1:01:46] wherever he could and he would back it
[1:01:48] with his hands he'd tell them israelites
[1:01:50] and so forth that he preached and we
[1:01:52] tried to get him convinced
[1:01:55] of who jesus was
[1:01:57] huh
[1:01:59] he had the burden of
[1:02:01] bringing the gospel to the gentiles
[1:02:03] didn't he
[1:02:04] amen
[1:02:06] through much pain through much suffering
[1:02:13] paul said it this way
[1:02:20] in first second corinthians four and
[1:02:22] seven
[1:02:23] he says we
[1:02:24] are in earth and vessels that the
[1:02:26] excellency of the power
[1:02:28] made of god and not of us
[1:02:30] i like that
[1:02:32] how many knows that the excellency of
[1:02:34] power it's not what you can do but it's
[1:02:37] what god can do to you
[1:02:41] that's what's so excellent that's what's
[1:02:43] so great
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:45] oh paul said we are troubled on every
[1:02:47] side yet not distressed we are perplexed
[1:02:50] but not in despair
[1:02:52] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[1:02:55] but not destroyed
[1:02:57] now notice this as christians we're
[1:03:00] always bearing about the dying of the
[1:03:02] lord jesus
[1:03:06] people will spit you in your face
[1:03:07] basically so to speak
[1:03:09] they'll persecute you they'll do
[1:03:10] everything that they did to jesus
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:15] see here we in laodicea here in the age
[1:03:17] we're living we got it real nice
[1:03:20] because how many of those there in those
[1:03:22] dark ages they knew what it was like to
[1:03:23] bear their cross they knew what it's
[1:03:25] like to get killed like christ died
[1:03:28] huh
[1:03:29] they knew what it was like to be
[1:03:30] persecuted to be hunted down to to be
[1:03:32] forsaken to be cast down they
[1:03:34] experienced all of those things
[1:03:37] we experienced it on a minor scale so to
[1:03:39] speak
[1:03:43] it amen comes to mind but sometimes we
[1:03:45] get discouraged i believe sometimes we
[1:03:47] get discouraged when it comes to
[1:03:49] witnessing
[1:03:51] amen remember brother baby says you know
[1:03:53] in desperation he says after what christ
[1:03:56] has done now he manifested himself it
[1:03:59] should throw every believer into
[1:04:01] desperation
[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:06] that the coming of the lord is at hand
[1:04:11] praise the lord
[1:04:14] let's go to another scripture
[1:04:28] hmm
[1:04:30] another scripture in
[1:04:33] well
[1:04:36] i don't believe i wrote it down
[1:04:39] here it is no
[1:04:49] it was it would have been ezekiel
[1:04:51] yeah ezekiel 9.
[1:04:54] ezekiel 9.
[1:05:01] now remember what brother ben talked
[1:05:02] about
[1:05:03] he says he would love for his church to
[1:05:06] shout speaking tongues dance in the
[1:05:07] spirit but what was the greatest thing
[1:05:09] that he wanted
[1:05:10] the people to have a burden
[1:05:14] a burden from the lord for the loss
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:22] let's start with
[1:05:24] verse three and the glory of god of
[1:05:26] israel was gone up from the cherub
[1:05:28] whereupon he was to the threshold of the
[1:05:31] house
[1:05:32] and he called to the man clothed with
[1:05:33] the with linen
[1:05:35] which had the writer's ink horn by his
[1:05:38] side
[1:05:39] and the lord said unto him go through
[1:05:41] the midst of the city
[1:05:43] through the midst of jerusalem and set a
[1:05:45] mark upon the foreheads of the men that
[1:05:48] sigh and that cry for all the
[1:05:50] abominations have done in the midst
[1:05:52] thereof
[1:05:54] and to the others he said in mine
[1:05:56] hearing go ye after him through the city
[1:05:59] and smite let not your eyes spare
[1:06:02] neither have ye petty
[1:06:05] slay utterly old and young both maids
[1:06:08] and little children women
[1:06:10] come not near unto any but come not on
[1:06:13] nine to any man upon whom is the mark
[1:06:17] and begin
[1:06:19] in church
[1:06:21] and begin in at my sanctuary
[1:06:25] woo
[1:06:27] how many knows
[1:06:29] if there's anybody that's heard it it's
[1:06:30] the churches
[1:06:32] huh
[1:06:34] the people that call themselves
[1:06:35] christians
[1:06:37] when the wrath of god is poured out
[1:06:40] amen that's who he's coming first
[1:06:44] amen then they began at the ancient men
[1:06:47] which were up before the house
[1:06:49] now notice going back again
[1:06:51] put a mark now y'all remember what
[1:06:53] brother brandon preached on the evidence
[1:06:55] of the holy ghost he says if there any
[1:06:57] evidence that i know if that would be a
[1:06:59] evidence of the holy ghost according to
[1:07:01] the scripture it's those that have the
[1:07:03] holy ghost they get mark it's those that
[1:07:06] sigh and cry for the abominations that's
[1:07:08] done in the city
[1:07:09] now let me ask you why do you think that
[1:07:11] it i don't know about you but it hurts
[1:07:14] me every time they do something immoral
[1:07:16] like legalizing uh a gays
[1:07:20] marriage
[1:07:21] i mean that was a disappointment
[1:07:25] like oh it hurts you
[1:07:28] why because it's an abomination that's
[1:07:30] done
[1:07:32] it's like oh my goodness where are we
[1:07:34] going then from there to now it's you
[1:07:37] know
[1:07:37] telling them and having this
[1:07:39] um
[1:07:41] what what did they even call it
[1:07:43] something about your the way that you
[1:07:45] talk and and a woman's be so
[1:07:47] supposed to be called the one that is
[1:07:49] child bearing person or something
[1:07:52] right
[1:07:52] instead of a woman or a wife and it's
[1:07:55] just one thing after the other and
[1:07:56] you're like my god help us
[1:08:00] so in other words tonight how many knows
[1:08:02] and that we should ask ourselves how
[1:08:04] much how much does that affect us even
[1:08:07] the sins and everything that's done
[1:08:09] everything is done wrong should affect
[1:08:11] you
[1:08:12] say god don't let this be don't let that
[1:08:15] bad every time somebody's backslidder
[1:08:17] gets away from god oh god don't let it
[1:08:19] backslide
[1:08:24] the burden of the word of the lord
[1:08:27] the burden of that holy spirit in there
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:34] it's a burden that we need to have amen
[1:08:45] now i mean this brother bam says i say
[1:08:47] this now reverently
[1:08:48] walking on brittle threads i believe
[1:08:50] that that day is about finished
[1:08:53] them that's in is in the doors are
[1:08:56] closing together
[1:08:58] you don't have that burden no more
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:04] billy graham's meetings across
[1:09:06] the country all roberts and all the rest
[1:09:08] of us we've cried we've prayed
[1:09:10] everything else but you see the doors
[1:09:12] are closing
[1:09:14] let him that's filthy be
[1:09:18] i'm quoting now
[1:09:20] let him that's righteous be righteous
[1:09:22] still holy that's holy still and i
[1:09:24] believe the doors of the gentiles is
[1:09:25] closing together the day the time to
[1:09:28] season is just about over if it was back
[1:09:31] then can you imagine how close it is now
[1:09:34] you see wouldn't it be nice if we had
[1:09:37] 20 people come and we could get 20
[1:09:39] people coming to church
[1:09:42] huh maybe have half of those get
[1:09:45] baptized
[1:09:47] my gracious if you had 10 baptism of the
[1:09:48] weekend that'd be a record wouldn't it
[1:09:51] one day used to do hundreds and hundreds
[1:09:53] of people
[1:09:55] when the revival was on
[1:09:57] amen
[1:09:59] somebody said brother tommy invited a
[1:10:01] whole bunch of people
[1:10:03] and he got one person to come
[1:10:05] one person okay
[1:10:07] huh isn't that about how it is
[1:10:11] people you know it it it's hard it's
[1:10:13] hard when when you try and want to but
[1:10:16] the problem is people don't want it
[1:10:17] anymore
[1:10:19] brother bram says one place a pawn has
[1:10:21] just about been sane dry
[1:10:24] you really don't find a lot of people
[1:10:25] that really care
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:28] they don't care about their souls they
[1:10:30] don't care about when you bring them to
[1:10:31] truth
[1:10:33] they just want to go their way to
[1:10:34] tarshish so to speak their own way
[1:10:38] my
[1:10:40] that's the hour that we're living in
[1:10:43] and we as christians we have to really
[1:10:45] be careful that even though it's in that
[1:10:47] shape and you know maybe some people
[1:10:49] don't want it but we should still be
[1:10:51] trying to get people in
[1:10:53] still be a witness i mean you shall be
[1:10:55] witness of me
[1:10:57] amen
[1:10:58] cried and prayed you see the doors are
[1:11:00] closing on down
[1:11:02] of the gentiles about the day the seas
[1:11:04] is just about over just few more to come
[1:11:06] in the reason that you can't have that
[1:11:08] kind of meeting like that he said
[1:11:09] there's no travail is so
[1:11:12] people they just don't have their burden
[1:11:15] you don't find it no more what's the
[1:11:16] matter the spirit of god is withdrawn
[1:11:24] now how many of those you can't you
[1:11:26] can't work something up
[1:11:28] no it has to be god that comes down it
[1:11:31] has to be god that does it
[1:11:33] a revival and a sweeping revival
[1:11:37] it is something that god does
[1:11:39] i remember when
[1:11:41] pinecraft had their revival brother john
[1:11:44] he was down there with us when we seen a
[1:11:46] lot of people are we seeing the brother
[1:11:48] john steam when we seen that church grow
[1:11:50] we've seen uh you know all kinds of
[1:11:52] different ones coming in and so forth
[1:11:55] just a little revival and people coming
[1:11:57] to god and so forth
[1:11:58] it's hard to find even that anymore
[1:12:01] but listen to what he says the spirit is
[1:12:03] almost withdrawn jesus predicted this
[1:12:06] he said uh because the love of many
[1:12:09] their love would fail because iniquity
[1:12:11] would abound the love of many shall fail
[1:12:15] amen
[1:12:18] see
[1:12:19] they grow cold
[1:12:22] love is dying away
[1:12:24] people don't care anymore
[1:12:27] folks people don't care they don't care
[1:12:29] about god they don't care about church
[1:12:30] they don't care about their neighbor
[1:12:34] there's not enough care in the world
[1:12:36] there's not enough love in the world
[1:12:40] it's dying away
[1:12:41] the number one thing is that that love
[1:12:43] for god
[1:12:44] that's the first thing because i
[1:12:46] guarantee you if you have the love of
[1:12:48] god in your heart you will not want to
[1:12:50] be a hermit
[1:12:52] no
[1:12:53] if you have the love of god in your
[1:12:55] heart you want to try
[1:12:57] you want to try to give what you have to
[1:12:59] other people
[1:13:01] it should hurt us when we go to walmart
[1:13:03] we see everybody all tattooed up the way
[1:13:05] that they're dressed they don't have to
[1:13:06] be that way they can have what you have
[1:13:09] if they'll just receive it
[1:13:11] how many believes that
[1:13:13] if they'll just accept it
[1:13:16] amen
[1:13:17] it's because love is dying away it's
[1:13:19] just the form listen
[1:13:22] they got into just the form beat the
[1:13:25] piano up and down real hard and
[1:13:27] hallelujah glory to god hallelujah
[1:13:29] praise the lord see like that and he
[1:13:31] says yet it's just the form
[1:13:35] huh
[1:13:35] don't fool yourself just don't fool
[1:13:37] yourself see
[1:13:39] oh my
[1:13:40] now he said i'm not just talking about
[1:13:42] the tabernacle i'm talking about what i
[1:13:44] find around the united states it's just
[1:13:46] become a form just kind of acting like
[1:13:48] what we used to have

[1:14:09] put us here on earth for a reason and
[1:14:12] that reason that he put us here for

[1:16:45] going to get nowhere well heavy he is
[1:16:49] why because you're all gonna get him
[1:16:51] better man how many brothers had a lot
[1:16:53] of that problems impersonating
[1:16:56] trying to be a prophet don't try to be
[1:16:58] that don't try to be something you're
[1:17:00] not

[1:17:04] it doesn't matter
[1:17:06] what it is
[1:17:09] oh he goes on down
[1:17:11] be the best i mean no it's just a
[1:17:12] housewife
[1:17:14] she's got one of the gravest
[1:17:16] responsibilities there is she's got the
[1:17:18] burden of raising them children of
[1:17:20] teaching them children
[1:17:23] the way of the lord that's her job by
[1:17:25] the time she says he says she's only
[1:17:27] really got about a 20-25 window your
[1:17:30] window there
[1:17:32] and when them kids are grown and get
[1:17:34] what they're gone your job's done
[1:17:38] so do the best job that you can
[1:17:41] fathers how many knows as a father it's
[1:17:43] a burden
[1:17:45] amen
[1:17:46] marriage brother he talks about here you
[1:17:48] know how did it's a great responsibility
[1:17:51] amen let me read a couple more quotes
[1:17:53] that all right
[1:17:54] now because that we have a
[1:17:56] responsibility then we've got to answer
[1:17:58] to god for some day
[1:18:00] whoa
[1:18:02] huh
[1:18:03] how many believes that
[1:18:05] we'll answer for what we did with that
[1:18:07] talent
[1:18:10] every man that come on the face of the
[1:18:12] earth has to answer to god for that
[1:18:14] responsibility
[1:18:16] and too many of us stewardship a
[1:18:19] stewardship we have to answer for
[1:18:21] this responsibility is a stewardship
[1:18:23] that's been committed to us by god i
[1:18:25] don't care what it is
[1:18:27] like i said a few minutes ago a
[1:18:29] housewife be a genuine housewife if it's
[1:18:32] to be a farmer be a genuine farmer
[1:18:36] whatever it is that god has put you here
[1:18:38] for you've got a stewardship to that and
[1:18:40] you've got the answer to god for it
[1:18:42] because it takes all these things to do
[1:18:44] it
[1:18:45] jonah he says
[1:18:47] he was called and here we find an
[1:18:48] example of all of us every one of us
[1:18:51] we're always respon we're always re
[1:18:54] running from responsibility because i
[1:18:56] mean a responsibility is a way it's
[1:18:59] it's a weight it's a burden
[1:19:03] people don't even like to hear that
[1:19:05] you've got to decide whether you want to
[1:19:06] go to heaven or hell they don't want to
[1:19:08] do that they don't want to hear that
[1:19:10] because now they're responsible for it
[1:19:14] because the bible says once you know it
[1:19:17] hey if you don't know it
[1:19:19] there'll only be a few stripes giving
[1:19:21] you for doing it wrong
[1:19:22] but if you know it don't do it you'll
[1:19:24] get a lot of stripes
[1:19:28] my
[1:19:29] think about the people that walk away
[1:19:31] from the message of the hour
[1:19:33] they know that it was right everybody
[1:19:35] that heard it all of those preachers and
[1:19:37] everybody brother of them it clearly
[1:19:38] talks about all of the ministers that
[1:19:40] know that it's the truth christ comes
[1:19:42] down and vindicates it
[1:19:45] but they shirk their responsibility to
[1:19:47] go another way
[1:19:49] folks i'm here to tell you
[1:19:51] whether you're a father and you don't
[1:19:53] want to beat that child you don't want
[1:19:54] to whoop that child that
[1:19:56] child might be like billy paul was and
[1:19:59] and sister branham said give him a
[1:20:00] weapon he was bad
[1:20:02] he was like well can't we forgive him
[1:20:04] this time or something
[1:20:06] huh y'all remember that
[1:20:08] he was upset because he wouldn't or
[1:20:09] whatever but we got to have the
[1:20:11] responsibility of correcting and so
[1:20:13] forth
[1:20:14] i know i've come up here many times
[1:20:16] folks i didn't want to be up here
[1:20:20] i knew what needed to be said
[1:20:23] huh
[1:20:24] i knew what needed to happen
[1:20:28] man i tried every way possibly but
[1:20:30] sometimes you just gotta come out and
[1:20:31] say it
[1:20:32] because it's your responsibility
[1:20:35] amen
[1:20:38] and i know what it's like to go back
[1:20:39] there
[1:20:43] it's on my chest now
[1:20:45] i've said what i was supposed to say
[1:20:48] i preached what i was supposed to preach
[1:20:50] let the chips fall where they may
[1:20:52] huh
[1:20:54] i can rest easy but i'll be tore up all
[1:20:57] night
[1:20:58] amen
[1:21:01] until
[1:21:02] i do what i'm supposed to do
[1:21:05] amen
[1:21:06] you talk about pain
[1:21:09] huh pastor
[1:21:11] let me tell you a little bit about
[1:21:12] something i don't know but i'm sure
[1:21:14] every one of you has had friends
[1:21:16] that were good friends
[1:21:18] perhaps they turned their back on you
[1:21:20] and stabbed you in the back hurt real
[1:21:22] bad
[1:21:22] huh
[1:21:24] this that or the other and you know the
[1:21:25] pain of that you cared about a person
[1:21:27] and they just don't care back
[1:21:29] huh and being a pastor i don't care who
[1:21:32] it is if they come to the lord come to
[1:21:33] church here i'm responsible for every
[1:21:35] one of them huh
[1:21:37] you care for people you love people
[1:21:40] and people come and go all the time
[1:21:43] i don't know if this is out here but i
[1:21:45] hope everybody here that comes to this
[1:21:47] church
[1:21:48] hears this tonight
[1:21:50] i love it when i can grow old with you
[1:21:54] that's my kind of friendship that's come
[1:21:55] my kind of sheep
[1:21:57] a minute
[1:21:59] because it's rough it's it's not easy
[1:22:01] you know
[1:22:03] especially if people leave with an
[1:22:04] attitude or not the right reason hello
[1:22:07] that is even harder
[1:22:10] all right
[1:22:12] but the thing of it is
[1:22:17] jesus says come unto me oh you were
[1:22:19] weary and heavy my yoke is easy and my
[1:22:21] burden light
[1:22:22] his yoke is easy remember
[1:22:24] it's light
[1:22:26] if you if you
[1:22:28] if you would not have the right spirit
[1:22:30] it would not be easy
[1:22:32] to forgive people
[1:22:34] but what makes it easy is when you have
[1:22:36] the holy ghost
[1:22:38] to love people it doesn't matter what
[1:22:39] they do to you
[1:22:41] amen our mind is with you
[1:22:43] with me but if you don't have it's hard
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:47] now notice
[1:22:49] here we find an example people run from
[1:22:51] they don't want that responsibility
[1:22:54] he says we're we're prone to run from it
[1:22:58] can we say this generation ran from it
[1:23:01] the preachers ran from it the church
[1:23:03] just ran from it we're prone to run from
[1:23:06] responsibility in the burden
[1:23:09] of being a christian and be in the light
[1:23:10] of the world
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:13] but you got to face it he says sometimes
[1:23:15] he takes the very height off of you
[1:23:20] huh it's very high sometimes off of you
[1:23:23] but you got to do it anyway
[1:23:25] we've got so many things that we have to
[1:23:27] do so much responsibility that we have
[1:23:29] to face and everybody has got a certain
[1:23:32] responsibility everything is a
[1:23:34] responsibility but a man says and it's
[1:23:36] so easy when responsibilities face us
[1:23:38] the shirt from them
[1:23:41] amen
[1:23:42] a responsibility listen
[1:23:45] and we find that marriage is a
[1:23:46] responsibility in all manners
[1:23:50] amen how many knows that not very many
[1:23:52] marriages make it
[1:23:54] today's world it is pathetic it's
[1:23:56] terrible how many marriages don't make
[1:23:59] it that's right
[1:24:01] why because
[1:24:03] living together
[1:24:06] being together
[1:24:09] and
[1:24:10] and getting upset with each other
[1:24:13] getting to the place where maybe you
[1:24:14] dislike each other
[1:24:16] you know brother bam says that natural
[1:24:18] filial love will turn to hate
[1:24:21] uh people that once love each other
[1:24:23] because of hardship because of the load
[1:24:26] sometimes
[1:24:27] they even kill each other
[1:24:29] turns to hate
[1:24:31] how many knows that's why you need
[1:24:32] christ in your marriage
[1:24:34] without christ in your marriage you
[1:24:36] stand a very slim chance
[1:24:39] because people are so spoiled and
[1:24:41] everybody wants to have their way
[1:24:44] i'll tell you what it don't never work
[1:24:46] if it's just one-sided you have to give
[1:24:48] both sides have to give
[1:24:50] amen
[1:24:51] it's a great responsibility
[1:24:55] it's a it it's a big burden they taking
[1:24:58] on
[1:24:59] that they don't think about whenever you
[1:25:00] know but sometimes when they get married
[1:25:02] a preacher has to perhaps be thorough
[1:25:04] about their obligations and so forth the
[1:25:06] obligations that they're taking on
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:10] but let me finish with this
[1:25:13] and being brought into the presence of
[1:25:15] god and see god made a promise and god
[1:25:19] is obligated to that promise and when he
[1:25:21] brings that promise to pass then people
[1:25:24] are afraid to face up the responsibility
[1:25:27] of coping with the message of the hour
[1:25:29] we find that everywhere
[1:25:33] how many believes that
[1:25:34] never before many places but it says man
[1:25:37] when we see christ and what he did it
[1:25:39] ought to set our souls on fire
[1:25:43] and keep it on fire how many please and
[1:25:44] keep it on fire don't let it dwindle
[1:25:46] down
[1:25:47] don't let that little light that you've
[1:25:48] got shining in your life don't let it
[1:25:50] dwindle down keep pruning get all that
[1:25:52] old smut and all of that black stuff out
[1:25:54] of your life and let your light shine
[1:25:57] amen but
[1:25:59] people
[1:26:00] oh and this is what hurt brother brown
[1:26:02] so much to see the people could see what
[1:26:04] it is christ to know that it's the truth
[1:26:07] and then they will come up
[1:26:09] and be responsible he says many
[1:26:10] preachers many people come to say well
[1:26:12] we believe it's the truth he says but if
[1:26:14] we believe that and teach that they'll
[1:26:16] kick us out
[1:26:19] he says well he says you're if you if
[1:26:22] you don't come in he said you'll be
[1:26:23] kicked out up there
[1:26:25] so you got to choose you got to choose
[1:26:27] which side or where you want to be
[1:26:29] kicked out of
[1:26:31] because you're going to be kicked out
[1:26:32] somewhere
[1:26:34] people are afraid to say no i believe
[1:26:36] the prophet of god i believe what god
[1:26:38] i'm not ashamed how many is more i am
[1:26:40] not ashamed of what god has done in this
[1:26:41] generation i'm not afraid to testify
[1:26:44] that it's more than just brother of adam
[1:26:46] it's jesus christ
[1:26:48] amen oh shouted from the housetops
[1:26:52] amen it's the truth a responsibility to
[1:26:55] uh to confess the truth
[1:26:59] oh my
[1:27:00] remember jesus said i come not to
[1:27:03] bring peace but a sword
[1:27:05] huh to bring a bird and the father will
[1:27:07] be against uh father-in-law
[1:27:09] daughter-in-law against so forth
[1:27:11] a lot of times it's within the family
[1:27:13] it's a burden
[1:27:14] it ain't easy
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:17] how many knows he didn't come to make it
[1:27:19] easy
[1:27:21] he come to
[1:27:23] bring you into a battle for the truth
[1:27:25] and for what's right
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:30] but he says so many people are taking
[1:27:31] their denomination denominational
[1:27:34] ships
[1:27:35] the tarshish
[1:27:36] going the easy way
[1:27:39] you know not the way like jonah jonah
[1:27:45] he wasn't the same man
[1:27:47] maybe maybe he had a life of luxury
[1:27:51] but then one god one day god called him
[1:27:54] says jonah i want you to go
[1:27:59] same as brother branham
[1:28:00] remember
[1:28:02] he heard the voice and so forth but one
[1:28:03] day god said for him to go
[1:28:06] and then because of his mother-in-law
[1:28:08] and all of that the pressure he was
[1:28:10] getting from his family he didn't go
[1:28:12] and boy it cost him didn't it
[1:28:15] and boy you talk about pain and
[1:28:17] suffering that he went through
[1:28:19] because he didn't go lost his wife lost
[1:28:21] his child
[1:28:22] he prayed for many people they were all
[1:28:24] healed but when it comes to healing his
[1:28:25] wife healing his baby
[1:28:27] no god took him home
[1:28:31] but what a comfort what a comfort it
[1:28:33] must have been for brother brennaman
[1:28:35] as
[1:28:36] hope came back
[1:28:38] remember that
[1:28:39] she says oh everything you preached
[1:28:41] about is so beautiful it's so beautiful
[1:28:43] i don't know about you but not just him
[1:28:45] but that comforts me
[1:28:47] because i know there's a land waiting
[1:28:48] for us
[1:28:50] amen when this debauchery of our land is
[1:28:52] this is all over with
[1:28:54] we're done praying and and
[1:28:57] and hurting because of the evil that's
[1:28:59] done everywhere
[1:29:01] we've got a place that we got to go
[1:29:03] that we can go that's a beautiful place
[1:29:06] oh it was so nice
[1:29:09] different times he saw his wife you know
[1:29:10] different places and sharon rose and so
[1:29:12] forth
[1:29:13] amen
[1:29:15] but back to jonah no jonah he had it
[1:29:17] maybe nice but then they'd come away on
[1:29:19] him
[1:29:20] i bet he was kind of stressful don't you
[1:29:22] reckon when he was in that boat and they
[1:29:24] were all throwing everything overboard
[1:29:27] all the extra food all the extra
[1:29:29] everything the light and the load
[1:29:31] and it still wouldn't quit still wasn't
[1:29:34] the ned they said there's somebody in
[1:29:35] here that's wicked
[1:29:37] somebody's bad and the lot fell on jonah
[1:29:40] huh
[1:29:42] imagine it was kind of a stressful time
[1:29:44] it was a burden the burden of the word
[1:29:46] of the lord to jonah
[1:29:48] to have to go down there as prophet god
[1:29:50] said he was a hebrew and those gentiles
[1:29:53] and theirs are going to say what are you
[1:29:54] doing down here
[1:29:56] he was very negative thought he never
[1:29:58] thought they'd never repent
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:00] finally after the fish he was in the
[1:30:02] fish's belly it was no easy thing
[1:30:05] just like our lives a lot of times are
[1:30:07] not easy how many knows a christian walk
[1:30:09] isn't meant to be easy blessed are those
[1:30:11] that weep now for they shall laugh
[1:30:14] blessed are those that are hungry now
[1:30:15] because they shall be filled
[1:30:17] jesus even said the christian life isn't
[1:30:19] a flowery bed of ease it's not all you
[1:30:22] know
[1:30:22] peace and joy so to speak
[1:30:25] in the outside but thank god there's
[1:30:27] peace and joy on the inside right
[1:30:30] amen it's okay that the outside is not
[1:30:32] peace and joy but i want to make sure
[1:30:33] the inside is so that you can be like
[1:30:35] paul
[1:30:37] who was what to be the next k ephesus he
[1:30:40] said man i was the pharisee of the
[1:30:42] pharisees he was respected regarded
[1:30:44] looked up to when he came they all stood
[1:30:46] to the side and here comes paul this is
[1:30:48] paul coming until he was the off
[1:30:51] scouring of the earth paul said you know
[1:30:52] we're the odds kind we're like sheep to
[1:30:54] the slaughter and oh my look at the life
[1:30:57] that jesus allowed him and put him
[1:30:59] through he says you're going to suffer
[1:31:00] many things and the life that he had
[1:31:03] but he yet he is the one that encouraged
[1:31:05] us
[1:31:06] we may be cast down but we're never
[1:31:07] forsaken amen
[1:31:09] all these things
[1:31:12] so my thought is lord help
[1:31:14] us having the holy ghost
[1:31:17] living the life of christ
[1:31:19] to feel about things the way that jesus
[1:31:22] would feel about it
[1:31:23] to think about things the way that jesus
[1:31:25] would think about him
[1:31:27] amen
[1:31:29] and even though we have the peace and
[1:31:31] the joy there's still a burden
[1:31:33] for our neighbors
[1:31:35] huh we could it'd be easy just never not
[1:31:37] say nothing
[1:31:39] huh but like brother brown says you know
[1:31:41] you warn a man hey you're going to go
[1:31:43] over a cliff he's your boat is not going
[1:31:45] to be able to make it
[1:31:47] in the tribulation it's not going to go
[1:31:49] in the rapture what you believe is not
[1:31:50] going to go in the rapture you're
[1:31:51] heading for a fall
[1:31:53] they say why shut up i'm be fine i've
[1:31:56] mind your own business but ibm says you
[1:31:59] might say well now just forget him he
[1:32:01] says but no we're going to run down the
[1:32:03] bank you say listen you've got to listen
[1:32:04] to me
[1:32:05] huh that's what's billy braham's
[1:32:07] attitude that's what he's trying to tell
[1:32:08] us you know have how many bc compassion
[1:32:11] the only reason the only reason that
[1:32:13] this world is keeping on going you know
[1:32:15] why
[1:32:20] because we're still here but the long
[1:32:22] suffering of christ
[1:32:24] not willing to perish he's just keeping
[1:32:27] on give him a little more chance come
[1:32:29] give me a little more chance give him
[1:32:30] another chance
[1:32:32] amen
[1:32:34] because that's the way god feels about
[1:32:36] it
[1:32:37] he doesn't want to see the day that
[1:32:38] every man woman and child is going to be
[1:32:41] destroyed huh
[1:32:43] you know because he says you know if you
[1:32:45] don't have that mark on you
[1:32:47] it doesn't matter whether you're a child
[1:32:49] whether you're a priest
[1:32:51] i don't care if you're a preacher up
[1:32:53] here you got that mark how many knows
[1:32:55] you're going in the tribulation period
[1:32:57] the rapture is coming for those whom the
[1:33:00] holy spirit has marked
[1:33:02] amen and the holy spirit marks those
[1:33:05] as i might say tonight that feel about
[1:33:07] it the way that jesus felt about it
[1:33:09] god bless you let's stand
[1:33:12] musicians if you'll come
[1:33:19] with our head spout tonight how many
[1:33:21] would say
[1:33:22] you know i believe that i should have
[1:33:23] more of a burden for the lost in what i
[1:33:25] do
[1:33:28] i shouldn't be so careful about the
[1:33:30] things of the world but i should care
[1:33:31] more about these souls that are out
[1:33:33] there that if they don't come into
[1:33:35] christ they're going to be lost
[1:33:37] god bless those hands my hand is up lord
[1:33:39] jesus i ask god that you would help me
[1:33:41] to have a greater care
[1:33:43] even as you did with jerusalem even
[1:33:45] though they rejected you every time
[1:33:46] called you up yells you up and
[1:33:48] everything else but yet you love them
[1:33:50] even as paul after they persecuted him
[1:33:53] and rejected him he still would give
[1:33:55] their life would trade his eternal life
[1:33:58] if they could just be saved
[1:34:00] lord jesus we want to have that kind of
[1:34:01] compassion we want to have that kind of
[1:34:03] love in our hearts lord jesus tonight
[1:34:04] father we ask god that you'd help to be
[1:34:07] just what you want us to be lord to feel
[1:34:09] the way that you would feel about it to
[1:34:10] live and to think the way that you would
[1:34:12] do lord live your life out through us
[1:34:15] lord let your holy spirit continue to
[1:34:16] rule and reign in our lives lord jesus
[1:34:19] we ask it in jesus name
[1:34:21] amen and amen god bless you
[1:34:31] [Music]
