[2:29] my
[3:52] good morning brothers and sisters if
[3:54] we'll go ahead and stand
[4:00] dismiss
[4:01] for the other sunday school classes at
[4:04] this time
[4:06] if i didn't do it right now i'd probably
[4:08] forget
[4:13] if brother
[4:15] powell would open in a word of prayer
[4:16] before we get started
[4:29] is
[4:50] amen if you return with me to
[4:53] for the bible reading the 12th chapter
[4:56] of ecclesiastes please
[5:04] there's only 12 verses here
[5:09] i know i get in a hurry so i'm taking
[5:11] that extra second to give you
[5:13] all a chance to get to that chapter
[5:20] all right i'll start with the first verb
[5:25] remember now thy creator in the days of
[5:28] thy youth while the evil days come not
[5:31] nor the years drawer nigh when thou
[5:33] shall say i have no pleasure in them
[5:44] and in that day when the keepers of the
[5:46] house shall tremble and the strong men
[5:48] shall bow themselves
[5:50] and the grinders cease because they are
[5:53] few and those that look out of the
[5:56] windows be dark
[6:10] also when thou shalt be afraid afraid of
[6:13] that which is high and fear shall be in
[6:16] the way and the almond tree shall
[6:18] flourish and the grasshopper shall be a
[6:20] burden
[6:21] and the desire shall fall because men
[6:24] goeth to his long home and the mourners
[6:27] go about the streets
[6:39] then shall the dust return
[6:41] to the earth as it was
[6:43] and the spirit shall return unto god who
[6:45] gave it
[6:51] and moreover because the preacher was
[6:53] wise he still taught to people knowledge
[6:56] yay
[6:57] he gave good heed and sought out and set
[7:00] in order many proverbs
[7:10] and the words of the wise are as goats
[7:13] and as nails fastened by the masters of
[7:15] assemblies which are given from one
[7:18] shepherd
[7:20] [Music]
[7:29] and let us hear the conclusion of the
[7:31] whole matter
[7:32] fear god
[7:34] keep his commandments for this is the
[7:36] whole duty of man
[7:38] for god shall bring every work into
[7:40] judgment with every seeking thing
[7:43] which is to be good or whether it be
[7:46] evil amen you can be seated
[7:49] you know you uh
[7:51] you just you can't get away from god's
[7:53] wisdom in the word of god the truths
[7:55] that are in it
[7:56] and then if you return with me
[7:58] to uh this
[8:00] morning to
[8:03] timothy ii timothy
[8:08] the third chapter it's a chapter
[8:10] everyone knows
[8:12] pretty good
[8:15] but i was sitting there this morning i
[8:17] was listening
[8:18] on my old eyes style ipod the you don't
[8:22] even see them i don't know
[8:24] i still use that in my office i still
[8:26] use that that old one the white one you
[8:29] know i just
[8:30] continually scroll through messages i
[8:33] just turned my ipod player on and just
[8:35] let us listen to what brother brown was
[8:37] talking about and one of these messages
[8:39] i can't
[8:42] tell you the date or the hour but he was
[8:44] talking about
[8:46] how how the world is gonna
[8:48] one day
[8:50] our country and the countries of the
[8:51] world are gonna be
[8:54] consumed and taken over by whether you
[8:57] call it whatever you call it one world
[8:59] government or something and i was
[9:01] listening to them talk about how it
[9:03] would happen
[9:04] and then you come 50 years later and
[9:06] that's it was 1960 1961 where
[9:10] were almost 60 years later depending on
[9:12] when you were born from that point and
[9:14] when you look at the world out there you
[9:16] can see the the roots of it and
[9:18] everything you turn now you can see the
[9:20] roots being manifested in the in the
[9:23] thing and you the
[9:25] way that our governments are falling the
[9:27] way people are falling it's like brother
[9:30] brad and brother thomas have been saying
[9:32] it's not going to get any better it's
[9:35] only going to get worse
[9:36] and the worst thing that the your enemy
[9:39] is doing to you and to the normal person
[9:42] outside is destroying your confidence
[9:46] and once you destroy a man or woman's
[9:48] confidence in his government in his town
[9:51] in his schools or
[9:53] in the natural sense you destroy that
[9:55] man or that woman if you destroy his
[9:58] confidence in the church you destroy him
[10:00] spiritually so when you destroy both of
[10:03] those organizations you actually destroy
[10:06] their ability to trust
[10:08] what they hear and to respond to it when
[10:10] they have no trust in any of that
[10:12] they're in a bad position they don't
[10:14] know which way to go and that's a
[10:15] horrible
[10:16] place to be and i was just reading this
[10:18] and listening to what he had to say
[10:21] and you can see it in our own government
[10:23] in our own country
[10:25] and
[10:26] and i wrote these notes down
[10:29] this morning and i was thinking
[10:31] what
[10:32] we have a difference in this message of
[10:34] the hour i hadn't even started reading
[10:37] yet that you
[10:39] you have to have confidence that you
[10:41] know the that you have the vision for
[10:43] the message of the hour that you live in
[10:46] what god has to reveal that to you if
[10:49] you have that confidence then you have
[10:51] that spark in your soul and that spark
[10:53] in your life no matter what happens you
[10:55] have a vision to see what yourself on
[10:58] the other side and if you don't have
[11:00] that then you're going to be just like
[11:01] everyone out in the world you're not
[11:03] going to have any confidence or any
[11:05] foundation
[11:06] so let me just read a few of these
[11:08] scriptures
[11:09] and uh i'm not going to i'll try not to
[11:11] read this whole chapter i know i say
[11:13] that and i do it anyway
[11:15] but uh starting at the third chapter of
[11:17] second timothy
[11:19] and i'll just read a few
[11:21] this know also
[11:23] that in the last days curious time shall
[11:26] come
[11:26] for men shall be lovers of their own
[11:28] selves covetous posters proud
[11:31] blasphemers disobedient to parents and
[11:33] unthankful and unholy
[11:35] and when you think of that don't think
[11:38] of your neighbor just think of your
[11:41] your environment what you live in we all
[11:43] have different types of jobs we all
[11:46] intermingle every day with different
[11:47] type of people put yourself in in the
[11:49] scriptures and i don't mean put yourself
[11:51] in a bad way that you're doing this but
[11:54] you're around people that are doing this
[11:56] every day of your life it goes on for
[11:58] men should be lovers of their own selves
[12:00] covetous posters plowed vast themes
[12:02] disobedient to parents and unthankful
[12:04] and unknowing
[12:06] without natural affections true
[12:08] spirituals false accusers incontinent
[12:11] fierce despisers of those that are good
[12:13] and that goes back to what
[12:15] i was originally saying that
[12:18] if outside of their your relationship
[12:21] with jesus christ and outside of your
[12:25] knowledge of the word everything out
[12:26] there in the world the foundations are
[12:28] breaking every day it gets worse every
[12:30] day you can't have any confidence in
[12:33] what's out there and that's what's what
[12:36] paul is saying here and he goes on the
[12:38] side they're despisers of those good
[12:41] traitors
[12:43] heady high-minded lovers of pleasures
[12:46] more than lovers of god
[12:48] having a form of godliness but denying
[12:50] the power thereof from such turn away so
[12:52] he's he's not just talking about the
[12:54] natural man out there but he's also
[12:57] talking about the church itself too and
[13:00] he goes on to say for
[13:02] for this order they would creep into
[13:04] houses and lead captive silly women
[13:06] laden with sins laid away with divers
[13:09] lust
[13:10] ever learning and never able to come to
[13:12] the knowledge of truth you know i used
[13:14] to think about that when i was younger
[13:16] that scripture i just read a lot
[13:19] and if you look at any ministry
[13:22] you can see the difference i i've
[13:23] listened to
[13:25] uh you know sometimes i spend a lot of
[13:27] time on the road so i've just turned the
[13:28] christian radio station on in the last
[13:31] 30 years 40 years i listened to these
[13:34] same ministers and what they said 30
[13:36] years ago and what they say today is not
[13:38] the same thing
[13:40] but you have the same message there's no
[13:42] change in the message every hour that
[13:44] you have it's steady and it's a rock it
[13:46] doesn't change you just believe what was
[13:48] said but that the church out there
[13:50] they're ever changing they're never
[13:52] coming to a true knowledge of the truth
[13:55] he goes on to say
[13:57] now it's janice and james with stood
[13:59] moses so that these also resist the
[14:01] truth men of corrupt minds represent
[14:04] reprobates concerning the faith but they
[14:06] shall proceed no further for their folly
[14:09] shall be made manifest on
[14:12] to all
[14:13] men as there also was that goes back to
[14:16] what i was saying if
[14:17] if you weren't in the message of the
[14:19] hour which doesn't make you better than
[14:21] anyone else you wouldn't have no vision
[14:23] to see what's going on on the face of
[14:25] the earth you wouldn't see the
[14:26] corruption you wouldn't see the lying
[14:29] and the misrepresentation
[14:31] of the gospel the way it is out there in
[14:32] the world you you'd just be like them
[14:35] it's just by grace that god chose you
[14:37] that's and it doesn't make you better
[14:39] than anyone else and it goes on to say
[14:42] for that was fully known my doctrine and
[14:44] manners of life
[14:46] purpose faith longsuffering charity and
[14:48] patience so paul's
[14:51] he's not lifting he's paul's not really
[14:53] lifting himself
[14:54] but he's using himself as an example for
[14:57] the believers to see
[14:59] what
[15:00] you know the good looks like and what
[15:02] the bad looks like
[15:04] and persecutions and afflictions that
[15:06] came on to me and antioch forgive my
[15:08] pronunciation and like them and listeria
[15:11] and lester
[15:13] with persecutions i don't endure but of
[15:16] all of them the lord delivered me yay
[15:18] and all and he goes on to say here i
[15:20] know this is
[15:22] hard sometimes to the flesh but it's
[15:24] truth yay
[15:25] all that will live godly in christ jesus
[15:28] shall suffer persecution
[15:30] you know people might not like you when
[15:31] you make a testimony for truth when you
[15:34] tell that man you're working with you're
[15:35] not going to lie for him because you're
[15:37] a christian you're not going to fudge on
[15:39] his hours you're not going to overpay
[15:41] him for work that he didn't do
[15:43] in the world we live in right now you'll
[15:45] make an enemy real quick just having a
[15:47] simple
[15:48] honesty and simple christian principles
[15:51] about the way you work or the way you
[15:53] deal with people will make you enemies
[15:55] in the day it goes on the say here
[15:57] even men seducers
[15:59] shall lack worse and worse deceiving and
[16:02] being deceived but continue thou and
[16:04] things with foul has learned and thou
[16:06] has been assured of knowing that of whom
[16:09] thou has learned them
[16:11] and he goes on to talk to timothy here
[16:13] and say that from a child thou has known
[16:15] the holy scriptures but you're able to
[16:17] make thee wise unto salvation through
[16:19] faith which is in christ jesus
[16:22] you know i was just thinking about what
[16:24] i said
[16:26] the hardest thing for some of you young
[16:28] men and young women when you're working
[16:30] around people that say they're
[16:31] christians
[16:32] that have a bad example when you know
[16:34] that they're not doing the work they
[16:36] should be doing not doing the things
[16:38] you're not supposed to let stuff like
[16:40] that be a stumbling block that shouldn't
[16:42] change your perspective shouldn't make
[16:44] you work any harder study any harder
[16:47] should make you just be straight as a
[16:49] rock and walk down the straight path i'm
[16:51] using their work sense but in a
[16:53] christian sense when you're doing in
[16:54] your prayer life don't let other
[16:57] people's looseness affect you you just
[16:59] stay on the straight path and just walk
[17:01] whether they're going to follow you or
[17:03] not you can't make them follow you you
[17:05] just got to choose to just take one step
[17:08] at a time no matter what people tell you
[17:10] he goes on to say here
[17:14] from a child out known the holy
[17:15] scriptures were able to make thee wise
[17:17] unto salvation through faith which is in
[17:20] christ jesus
[17:22] and all scripture and this is what you
[17:23] have to hold on to
[17:25] in the age of 11. brother adam said this
[17:27] in many different ways
[17:29] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[17:31] god
[17:32] and is profitable for doctrine for
[17:34] reproof
[17:35] for correction for instruction and
[17:37] righteousness
[17:39] that jesus is like you said you got to
[17:41] see yourself in the scripture
[17:43] that that the man of god may be perfect
[17:45] for finished onto all good works
[17:48] and i just wrote a few notes here this
[17:50] morning
[17:52] as i was listening to that message he
[17:53] was talking to canadians about america
[17:55] how it was going to be taken over and i
[17:58] was listening to it you know
[18:00] being overseas and going all the places
[18:02] i have
[18:03] when you when you see
[18:05] the things they did in third world
[18:06] countries they're starting to do in your
[18:08] own country you can see that you're at
[18:09] the end but i was just writing some
[18:12] things but you have some rules on the
[18:13] road that god gave you for the prophet
[18:15] of the hour and i everyone knows this i
[18:18] say this a lot
[18:19] you know in a lot of messages brother
[18:21] branham said your abcs always believe
[18:23] christ and that might some of your
[18:26] people you deal with out there the world
[18:29] might call you a simpleton because you
[18:31] you're always going to believe what the
[18:32] word of god says no matter what they
[18:34] tell you
[18:35] but that's the truth y'all
[18:38] always going to believe christ you're
[18:40] always going to believe the word of god
[18:42] you know brother branham said also
[18:45] read your bible and pray every day
[18:46] that's another rule of the road you have
[18:48] to do that if you don't
[18:51] do that every day you're not going to be
[18:54] successful and uh the last thing i'll
[18:57] finish with a lot of people preachers
[18:59] have been dealing with you know that
[19:00] token has to be applied in your life
[19:03] if you don't have that token in your
[19:04] life like i said just when i started
[19:07] you're going to be all over the plate
[19:08] you know i mean you're not gonna be able
[19:09] to hit the ball it's not gonna happen
[19:11] you have to have the token in your heart
[19:13] and in your life and then from there
[19:15] you'll be successful are you gonna have
[19:17] rough spots on the road i can't say
[19:19] whether you are or not but if you have
[19:22] the token if god has taken over your
[19:24] heart and life you have all the tools
[19:26] you need to be successful brother one

[48:34] it'll be but maybe a little mini series

[49:05] wrote down so we'll just move it to the
[49:07] end i just like that you know at first i
[49:09] thought well maybe i should just leave
[49:10] it you know but i said no i think it'd

[49:46] power and majesty of such a precious
[49:48] name
[49:49] the babe of bethlehem the bright and
[49:51] morning star
[49:52] let's sing his praises near and far
[49:55] let's talk about jesus the bread of life
[49:58] you see the savior of the world the man
[50:01] of galilee the prophet the priest the
[50:03] king the mighty god is he the well of

[50:24] he the lamb for sinner slain the man of
[50:27] calvary the great emmanuel the word of
[50:30] god sublime
[50:32] he is a bridegroom so divine
[50:35] amen i believe somebody else had a
[50:36] revelation amen of what our lord really
[50:39] is
[50:40] amen so if you will turn your bibles
[50:42] this morning to the book of ephesians
[50:45] amen and with the help of the lord i
[50:47] debated on
[50:48] on on a couple little different thoughts
[50:50] i wanted to talk about the eagle aminos
[50:53] he is jehovah eagle
[50:55] he types himself as the eagle
[50:57] amen also we know that even a lot of
[50:59] different nature things in nature
[51:01] represent the lord jesus christ
[51:03] represent god like the lion the eagle
[51:07] a lamb uh
[51:08] a dove right there's a lot of different
[51:11] things that he created that display his
[51:14] attributes amen but in ephesians
[51:18] um
[51:21] chapter 1 and we'll begin with reading
[51:24] 17 and this morning we want to talk
[51:26] about him as a warrior all right or a
[51:29] mighty conqueror how many believes he's
[51:31] the conqueror he's a warrior he's a
[51:33] soldier amen
[51:34] and we want to look at him as that amen
[51:36] so maybe wednesday we'll look at him as
[51:38] the eagle amen and in the eagle we want
[51:41] to talk about how that that eagle is a
[51:43] special built bird amen and we want to
[51:45] talk about some of the materials that
[51:47] it's made out of amen and so uh but
[51:50] anyway this morning we want to focus
[51:52] pretty much on
[51:54] uh him as a warrior a man or a soldier
[51:58] amen the mighty conqueror the savior the
[52:01] messiah amen so that's kind of the area
[52:04] that we want to go
[52:05] in ephesians chapter 1 and verse 17 that
[52:08] the god of our father the god of our
[52:11] lord jesus christ the father of glory
[52:13] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[52:16] and revelation
[52:17] in the knowledge of him the eyes of your
[52:19] understanding being enlightened that you
[52:22] may know what is the hope of his calling
[52:24] and what the riches of the glory
[52:26] of his heart of his inheritance in the
[52:29] saints and what is the exceeding
[52:32] greatness of his power
[52:34] to us word who believe
[52:36] according to the working of his mighty
[52:39] power which he wrought in christ when he
[52:42] raised him from the dead
[52:44] and set him at his own right hand in
[52:46] heavenly places
[52:47] now notice he's far above
[52:50] all principalities
[52:52] and powers
[52:54] and might and dominion
[52:57] and every name that is named not only in
[52:59] this world but also that is what which
[53:01] is to come
[53:02] and hath put
[53:03] all things under his feet in other words
[53:06] he conquered
[53:08] everything amen
[53:11] oh my and he gave him to be the head
[53:14] over all things to the church which is
[53:16] his body the fullness of all that
[53:19] filleth all in all in revelations 2
[53:23] i mean
[53:24] you know it's
[53:26] revelations one i wrote down two but
[53:29] it's chapter one
[53:30] revelations chapter one
[53:39] verse 16 says and he had in his right
[53:41] hand seven stars and out of his mouth
[53:44] went a sharp two-edged sword and his
[53:47] countenance was as the sun shineth
[53:50] in his strength and when i saw him i
[53:52] fell at his feet as dead and he laid his
[53:55] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[53:58] not i am the first
[54:01] and the last amen there's another
[54:03] attribute right that's something else
[54:05] that he is he's the first he's the last
[54:08] i'm he that liveth
[54:10] and was
[54:12] dead
[54:13] wow
[54:14] what a statement for god to make
[54:18] i am alive but i was dead i'm the first
[54:21] and the last amen
[54:23] and i am alive forevermore amen and have
[54:27] the keys of hell
[54:29] and of death may god that is blessings
[54:31] to the reading of the word you can be
[54:33] seated this morning
[54:47] i guess there is a
[54:49] something that i can't testify that i
[54:52] know
[54:54] and that is what it's like to be a
[54:56] soldier
[54:59] right
[55:00] naturally speaking anyway now i could
[55:03] tell you some stories have already and
[55:05] maybe told you too many times
[55:09] you know what way i know i'm getting old
[55:11] it's when i keep repeating myself
[55:13] [Laughter]
[55:15] oh yeah well
[55:17] have you ever noticed that about old
[55:18] folks a lot of times they'll tell you a
[55:20] story over and over
[55:21] you know you're like hey you told me
[55:23] that five times already i know the story
[55:26] so i watched myself i'm like like don't
[55:28] tell that story just too many times if
[55:30] you think you're getting senile stuff
[55:32] but anyway uh so anyway so
[55:36] yeah but anyway so think about that i
[55:39] think about a soldier brother brian here
[55:41] i guess was a real soldier for many
[55:42] years right
[55:44] amen and so he knows what it's like to
[55:46] be to be a soldier but there's supposed
[55:48] to be you know supposed to be something
[55:51] attractive i guess about a soldier to a
[55:53] girl or whatever girl likes older
[55:55] because they're supposed to be big bad
[55:57] brave and all of that right
[56:00] but there's a certain pride no doubt
[56:02] that goes with being a soldier
[56:04] and that right if you ever see any
[56:06] soldiers pictures you don't have the
[56:08] head tongue down and
[56:10] they're
[56:12] they're back as far as they can they're
[56:14] soldiers right
[56:15] you know they're soldiers they're proud
[56:17] they're they're military they're
[56:20] they're bad so to speak you know and
[56:22] supposed to be smart and all of that
[56:24] and so but there's something about it
[56:26] there's something about a war there's
[56:28] something about fighting there's
[56:29] something about victory right
[56:32] and that is in that it's em embedded
[56:34] into human beings
[56:36] right well as us as human beings because
[56:39] we certainly have had our share of
[56:42] wars we've had our share of battles
[56:45] we've had our share of people
[56:48] who actually wanted to conquer the world
[56:51] right
[56:52] who wanted to be mighty conquerors who
[56:55] who had great military mics and so forth
[56:58] amen and so they would go out and they
[57:00] would conquer and and so forth we know
[57:02] that's what the devil is out to do the
[57:04] devil is a conqueror he's a fighter
[57:07] he knows what battle is all about
[57:11] right
[57:12] and what war is all about
[57:15] how many knows that truly we are in a
[57:18] war
[57:19] how many of those years of war
[57:21] come on folks don't just say you know
[57:23] sometimes we like to make it well you
[57:25] know no but it's actually you are in
[57:27] about you are in a war my friend
[57:30] we are in a whoa a all-out full-out war
[57:38] and it seems the left seems to be doing
[57:39] better than the right
[57:41] right now in this world
[57:43] the bad side's winning
[57:46] huh
[57:47] for the most part in this world they're
[57:49] winning they're getting the upper hand
[57:52] hey those who make things worse they're
[57:53] winning they're making it worse yet
[57:55] every day they go about making it worse
[58:00] amen and they they thrive on
[58:04] how many knows and and i think i've seen
[58:06] in the news the other day is somebody in
[58:07] the
[58:08] in canada that was that was arrested he
[58:11] says you know you don't you you can't
[58:14] under uh what is it could take for
[58:16] granted your freedoms
[58:18] you don't realize what that people and
[58:20] then the devil wants to take your
[58:21] freedoms
[58:23] you know once you end up in jail you're
[58:24] like waking up hey boy i didn't think
[58:26] you could be that you know but how many
[58:28] knows that there's some somebody
[58:29] arrested because they didn't have a
[58:31] cover shot
[58:32] or something like that just go crazy
[58:34] stuff going on but no so listen what i'm
[58:37] trying to say is listen they were in a
[58:38] battle we're in a real battle real
[58:41] warrior and that's why they even uh the
[58:44] the songwriter was inspired to write
[58:46] that song about onward christian
[58:49] soldiers marching as who are
[58:52] right how many knows we are soldiers
[58:54] even brother brahmin the greatest battle
[58:56] ever fought talked about how that god is
[58:58] equipping god is training
[59:02] help me out this morning soldiers
[59:06] he's getting soldiers ready
[59:09] to fight this final battle
[59:15] how many has to fight really hard
[59:17] against a great big old mean ugly guy
[59:21] goliath that's called lukewarmness
[59:26] that's right if he can't get to no other
[59:28] way he'll get you to just
[59:30] relax they'll get you right there just
[59:33] put your armor down a little bit don't
[59:36] pray like you should don't read your
[59:37] bible like you should don't be sincere
[59:39] like you should just let down a little
[59:41] bit
[59:42] and ain't long and you ain't even in the
[59:44] pew anymore
[59:46] yeah i need to be the church
[59:50] if i don't they don't take much folks
[59:51] you're in a battle whether you know it
[59:53] or not
[59:55] the devil wants you to be he don't want
[59:57] you to be hot or cold he wants you to be
[59:59] lukewarm
[1:00:00] just somewhere in between sure we all
[1:00:02] battle it because we're living in that
[1:00:04] age
[1:00:06] amen so we are in a battle for sure we
[1:00:09] are
[1:00:11] so now let's look at this because as we
[1:00:13] think about looking at the lord looking
[1:00:15] at god i mean that's a really good way
[1:00:18] real good direction to look
[1:00:21] the bible says one place look unto me ye
[1:00:24] ends of the earth and be saved
[1:00:27] if you're ever going to get saved you're
[1:00:29] going to have to look to him because
[1:00:30] he's the savior
[1:00:32] all right let's talk a little bit about
[1:00:33] this maybe wednesday i'll take some
[1:00:35] scriptures a lot of scriptures of the
[1:00:37] different things that god said he is
[1:00:39] because we want to lay out first of all
[1:00:41] perhaps a layout of all the things that
[1:00:43] god is and then take go through the
[1:00:46] scriptures and look at how that god
[1:00:48] manifested himself in those things that
[1:00:51] he said that he was
[1:00:54] brother bannon makes it this says it
[1:00:56] this way christ the mystery of god
[1:00:57] revealed
[1:00:58] amen because let me see here uh if i can
[1:01:02] find it here
[1:01:04] this would be in ephesians paul talking
[1:01:08] paul talking about i believe it was
[1:01:20] about the great mystery of god galatians
[1:01:22] i think it may be in galatians
[1:01:24] give me a second would you
[1:01:27] we're going to take our time
[1:01:35] talking about the mystery of god how
[1:01:37] many knows that god has had a mystery
[1:01:39] it's been a mystery ever since the
[1:01:41] beginning of time
[1:01:43] amen
[1:01:45] but in chapter one of ephesians he says
[1:01:48] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:01:49] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[1:01:51] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:01:54] places in christ jesus according as he
[1:01:56] has chosen us in him before the
[1:01:59] foundation of the world that we should
[1:02:01] be holy and without blame
[1:02:03] before him in love
[1:02:05] having predestinated us unto the
[1:02:07] adoption of children by christ jesus
[1:02:09] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:02:11] of his own will
[1:02:13] to the praise of his glory of his grace
[1:02:16] where he never made us accepted in him
[1:02:18] beloved in whom we have redemption
[1:02:20] through his blood the forgiveness of
[1:02:22] sins according to the riches of his
[1:02:23] grace
[1:02:24] and have a bound that towered us in all
[1:02:27] wisdom and prudence
[1:02:30] having made known unto us the mystery
[1:02:34] of his will
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:39] folks in this hour we know that we
[1:02:41] understand
[1:02:43] what it's really all about better than
[1:02:45] anybody ever
[1:02:48] better than anybody ever has we
[1:02:50] understand
[1:02:51] what was in god's mind
[1:02:55] now brother baum says now god's secret
[1:02:57] mystery that he had before the world
[1:02:58] began
[1:02:59] back in the back part of god's mind
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:07] well oh that the world would hear this
[1:03:10] this morning
[1:03:11] we're going to talk about what god had
[1:03:13] it is the back part in the deepest part
[1:03:16] of his mind
[1:03:18] before he made the first stardust
[1:03:20] actually before he even formed angels to
[1:03:23] worship him
[1:03:27] i remember my mom's mom his preacher
[1:03:30] never preached this to me brother john
[1:03:33] he never told me that god at one time
[1:03:36] wasn't god
[1:03:42] he was
[1:03:43] the self-existing one
[1:03:46] right he's just self-existing god means
[1:03:51] an object of worship
[1:03:53] and if something makes worship and yeah
[1:03:56] you ain't no god
[1:03:59] oh wow whoa that's deep for somebody
[1:04:02] right they thought what do you mean he
[1:04:03] wasn't god i knew anybody that would
[1:04:05] have never heard that before would have
[1:04:06] been critical to that statement what do
[1:04:07] you mean he would not
[1:04:10] only because god means an object of
[1:04:12] worship he was self-existing one don't
[1:04:15] mean that god didn't exist
[1:04:17] he existed but he didn't have anything
[1:04:19] to worship him
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:26] and so
[1:04:29] oh i like it
[1:04:32] you know
[1:04:34] oh my when you think about god it's just
[1:04:36] it's just so awesome it just makes
[1:04:39] makes me smile just to think about him
[1:04:42] to think that there's absolutely no
[1:04:44] imperfections in god
[1:04:47] one of the things i wrote down here and
[1:04:48] is that god you know in this in this
[1:04:51] with god god has never ever
[1:04:55] been defeated
[1:04:58] right
[1:04:59] he's too perfect for that all it would
[1:05:01] take is for god to be defeated one time
[1:05:05] right just one time
[1:05:08] and he wouldn't really be god he'd be
[1:05:10] imperfect imperfect imperfect now with
[1:05:13] us human beings we're
[1:05:15] far from perfect
[1:05:19] something else i thought about in
[1:05:20] studying this as we begin to look at god
[1:05:23] it brought me to the
[1:05:25] thought that our prophet taught us he
[1:05:27] says that you do not look at yourself
[1:05:31] when you fail and how terrible you are
[1:05:38] we as human beings are pathetic
[1:05:41] we're the biggest bunch of failures you
[1:05:43] ever saw
[1:05:48] how many knows you was born a failure
[1:05:52] i say that because the bible says you
[1:05:54] were born in sin shaped into thick but
[1:05:56] he come into this world speaking lies
[1:06:00] the first chance you got you lied
[1:06:08] the first chance you got you stole that
[1:06:11] cookie
[1:06:14] huh
[1:06:16] yeah it was in your nature
[1:06:19] born of failure
[1:06:22] and folks i've been a christian for for
[1:06:25] for i don't know can't even remember
[1:06:27] about 30 40 years maybe
[1:06:30] and when i think about even my christian
[1:06:33] life and the failures in my christian
[1:06:36] life it's depressing
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:40] of how many times i've failed
[1:06:43] oh i know there's people just think
[1:06:45] they're perfect and never fail but you
[1:06:47] ain't got the holy ghost like you should
[1:06:48] because the holy ghost will show you
[1:06:50] where you're not perfect
[1:06:54] if you ain't got the holy ghost you're
[1:06:56] perfect and everybody else is terrible
[1:07:00] ah look at that one look at this one
[1:07:02] you're always looking at everybody
[1:07:04] else's bad places
[1:07:06] but if you got the holy ghost she'll
[1:07:08] make you look at your own places
[1:07:11] hello
[1:07:13] that's why the prophet said even as a
[1:07:14] christian if you fail if you would just
[1:07:17] continuously harbor that failure
[1:07:20] think of how depressed you would be
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:24] but you don't look at that what do we
[1:07:26] look to
[1:07:28] calvary
[1:07:30] we look to him
[1:07:32] why because
[1:07:34] he is perfect
[1:07:37] he never made the first mistake
[1:07:40] he never lost one
[1:07:42] battle
[1:07:48] the disciples lost the battle
[1:07:50] his children loses battles
[1:07:52] people that he uses loses battles
[1:07:55] huh
[1:07:56] sure they lose battles samson lost the
[1:07:59] battle david lost the battle
[1:08:03] peter
[1:08:04] had the very faith of god now the
[1:08:06] prophet teaches us that the faith is
[1:08:09] never defeated it cannot be defeated
[1:08:12] isn't that right
[1:08:14] faith can't
[1:08:15] but they ain't talking about you
[1:08:17] peter had faith oh he had that faith but
[1:08:20] guess what he got away from faith when
[1:08:22] he began to look at circumstances
[1:08:25] faith began to leave him and he began to
[1:08:28] sink
[1:08:29] huh
[1:08:32] wouldn't it be something since the
[1:08:34] chinese if the story was jesus walked on
[1:08:36] the water and he ended up having to swim
[1:08:40] because he lost faith
[1:08:41] he swam the rest away to the boat
[1:08:45] i don't want to hear
[1:08:48] no i mean he was imperfect that he lost
[1:08:51] faith
[1:08:52] lose a drop of faith that water was just
[1:08:54] as hard at the beginning of the shore as
[1:08:56] it was when he got to the boat that
[1:08:58] water was hard
[1:09:01] well whatever it was
[1:09:03] but he walked on it right
[1:09:06] maybe he was floating i don't know but
[1:09:08] i'll tell you what his faith aren't you
[1:09:10] glad for a savior
[1:09:11] oh what a savior oh what a savior is
[1:09:15] mine
[1:09:17] praise be to god
[1:09:19] us human beings we're grateful for why
[1:09:22] because when we do some but when we
[1:09:24] do fall that there is a
[1:09:27] there is a mediator somebody we can look
[1:09:29] to and say god pick me back
[1:09:32] up don't don't everybody go running
[1:09:35] around right now but aren't you glad
[1:09:36] that he let you get back up
[1:09:39] aren't you glad that when he forgives
[1:09:41] you because of your laxation on us and
[1:09:43] everything else and all the failures
[1:09:45] that you are he allows you to be
[1:09:46] forgiven again and clean in your heart
[1:09:49] have joy
[1:09:52] like i said just hold your peace
[1:09:55] don't get too happy
[1:09:57] but i'm happy for the grace of almighty
[1:09:59] god
[1:10:02] a lot of us probably wouldn't have come
[1:10:04] to church this morning if you looked at
[1:10:06] your failure
[1:10:07] well i failed today i don't deserve
[1:10:09] forgiveness i don't
[1:10:11] i don't we don't we don't the devil
[1:10:13] wanna the devil wants to tell you you
[1:10:14] don't deserve it
[1:10:16] that's why a lot of them a lot of them
[1:10:17] take a gun to their head
[1:10:20] yeah you deserve it
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:25] so we think about that
[1:10:28] that's right way back
[1:10:30] way
[1:10:31] way
[1:10:32] way
[1:10:34] back
[1:10:36] before there was before he created any
[1:10:39] kind of
[1:10:40] uh
[1:10:41] voice
[1:10:42] for us to speak with before he made my
[1:10:45] hand before he made the earth
[1:10:47] before there was any stars
[1:10:51] there was god
[1:10:54] there was a self-existing one
[1:10:56] first thing he made from what we
[1:10:58] understand and he said he created
[1:11:00] angels
[1:11:03] right created angels the bible says that
[1:11:06] they don't rest day and night but
[1:11:09] they're going holy holy holy
[1:11:12] holy holy
[1:11:15] they don't get tired
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:18] how many is looking forward to maybe
[1:11:20] being able to hear these angels
[1:11:22] getting in the presence of these angels
[1:11:25] amen here holy holy holy unto the lord
[1:11:32] then he was a god
[1:11:34] huh
[1:11:35] he created a lot of angels
[1:11:39] amen put them a foot to put them on
[1:11:40] three moral agency
[1:11:43] put them on freeman agency
[1:11:46] and of course you know one of them got
[1:11:48] jealous because he wanted to be a god
[1:11:50] too
[1:11:51] lucifer the devil
[1:11:53] right
[1:11:54] he got jealous
[1:11:55] he wanted to be like the most high
[1:11:58] he wanted to sit on the mound of the
[1:11:59] congregation be like the most high
[1:12:02] be above the sires of the arms
[1:12:05] that's
[1:12:06] right oh my but anyway let's go back
[1:12:12] so there he was there god was before
[1:12:15] anything was made before he was even god
[1:12:21] and what we're going to talk about
[1:12:23] is
[1:12:25] god's attributes or we could
[1:12:28] put it into a little
[1:12:30] planer
[1:12:31] words perhaps
[1:12:33] is we want to talk about what god
[1:12:37] is
[1:12:38] it's what he is
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:44] who he is
[1:12:45] what he is
[1:12:48] amen no not notice here now
[1:12:52] it was something that he was trying
[1:12:54] and was going to achieve
[1:12:57] and he had a motive in doing it
[1:13:00] in order to let himself be expressed
[1:13:03] huh
[1:13:05] praise the lord
[1:13:10] to express himself
[1:13:12] because first there wasn't even a moon a
[1:13:14] star at a molecule or anything he was
[1:13:17] god but he wasn't exactly god at the
[1:13:20] time because he was
[1:13:21] god is an object of worship
[1:13:23] there was nothing to worship so in his
[1:13:25] great mind he wanted these attributes to
[1:13:28] be
[1:13:29] expressed
[1:13:33] amen now while we've got god way before
[1:13:36] there was ever a stardust before there
[1:13:39] was a star a moon or angel or
[1:13:42] any
[1:13:44] thing remember this
[1:13:46] that everything that god was
[1:13:49] he is right now
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:55] how many remembers the prophet of god
[1:13:56] making a statement that god likes to
[1:13:58] take and show his children his muscles
[1:14:02] y'all remember him making that statement
[1:14:04] it's like a dad and he'll
[1:14:06] show him his muscles say here look at
[1:14:08] this son
[1:14:10] huh
[1:14:14] you know i've i thought about that and i
[1:14:16] thought
[1:14:17] i thought where's the scripture for such
[1:14:19] a thing where's the scripture for god
[1:14:21] showing off his muscles
[1:14:23] all right now found one would you like
[1:14:25] it
[1:14:28] for the scripture
[1:14:30] saith unto pharaoh
[1:14:33] even for this same purpose have i raised
[1:14:36] thee up that i
[1:14:37] might show
[1:14:39] my
[1:14:40] power
[1:14:43] in thee
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:46] in other words he raised him up he says
[1:14:48] i raised you up i made you a great
[1:14:51] kingdom but i knew what kind of a heart
[1:14:53] you have i know what kind of a guy you
[1:14:55] are so i know you're as stubborn as a
[1:14:57] mule so since you're that way already
[1:15:00] and i've done everything under the book
[1:15:01] that that is to be done and you've
[1:15:03] enslaved my people for all this time
[1:15:05] whatever i do to you i'm justified so
[1:15:07] i'm gonna harden your heart
[1:15:10] and even though you might want to let
[1:15:11] him go i'm not going to let you because
[1:15:13] i'm going to change your mind about it
[1:15:19] i don't hear one amen but that's the
[1:15:21] gospel truth the bible says that he
[1:15:23] hardens
[1:15:24] pharaoh's heart
[1:15:27] is that right so that he would not let
[1:15:29] him go and then i'm gonna whoop you for
[1:15:33] don't think there's injustice with god
[1:15:34] if you do that you better go back to
[1:15:36] your prayer bones
[1:15:38] he had already done enough to
[1:15:41] be destroyed completely
[1:15:43] just like he did on the red sea because
[1:15:46] of what he done
[1:15:47] there's no injustice of god
[1:15:50] amen but notice that i thought about
[1:15:52] that that's that's one place and another
[1:15:54] in the old testament i seen it this
[1:15:56] morning
[1:15:59] oh wow right there it is
[1:16:01] for the lord your god dried up the
[1:16:03] waters of jordan be from before you
[1:16:05] until you were passed over as the lord
[1:16:08] your god did to the red sea which he
[1:16:10] dried up from before us until we were
[1:16:13] all on over that all the people of the
[1:16:16] earth
[1:16:17] might know that the hand of
[1:16:20] god the lord that it is
[1:16:24] mighty
[1:16:27] how many believes this morning god has a
[1:16:31] mighty heart
[1:16:36] other places he says strong is the lord
[1:16:39] that delivereth thee the hand of the
[1:16:41] lord that delivereth thee
[1:16:43] praise be to god
[1:16:46] you know because i don't believe in just
[1:16:48] talking about a god of history but a god
[1:16:50] of today
[1:16:52] amen what we could get into this morning
[1:16:54] of
[1:16:55] what god did to brother branham's
[1:16:57] ministry
[1:16:58] the battles that he fought the warrior
[1:17:00] that he was the things that he did
[1:17:03] amen
[1:17:06] that got through did that god did in our
[1:17:07] generation
[1:17:09] and then hopefully every one of us has a
[1:17:12] testimony in our own
[1:17:14] heart of what god has done in your life
[1:17:19] because brother bran's fine that's all
[1:17:21] we believe all that but what is god
[1:17:22] doing in your life
[1:17:24] do you know him as some of these
[1:17:27] attributes that he
[1:17:28] is that's a good question
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:36] so i thought about this that's right
[1:17:38] don't look at yourself you get depressed
[1:17:42] but look at him
[1:17:45] look at him
[1:17:47] how many knows that if you
[1:17:50] allow
[1:17:52] yourself to live
[1:17:54] you'll really be depressed
[1:17:56] but any good that is in you
[1:18:00] how many knows it's not you but it's him
[1:18:05] praise be to god
[1:18:07] it's him in you
[1:18:09] that's the only thing that we have to
[1:18:11] brag about we as human beings we have
[1:18:14] nothing nothing i want to want to say
[1:18:16] little because we sure like to brag
[1:18:18] about what we can do
[1:18:20] we would like to brag about what we did
[1:18:22] even preachers
[1:18:25] oh but we had a we had 2 000 people
[1:18:28] there last night
[1:18:30] huh
[1:18:31] we had a bigger crowd than them people
[1:18:33] over there did
[1:18:35] you selfish ornery little thing
[1:18:37] huh
[1:18:40] that's right even we can get
[1:18:43] to where our human side is in it's very
[1:18:45] easy it can happen real easy
[1:18:48] how many believes that we've got to have
[1:18:49] a lot of grace for us each other
[1:18:51] you're gonna have a lot of grace for me
[1:18:52] i gotta have a lot of grace for you
[1:18:54] otherwise the sparks are gonna fly
[1:18:56] upwards
[1:19:00] because we are far from perfect
[1:19:03] but we are working
[1:19:04] on
[1:19:05] the lord have his way with us
[1:19:07] so
[1:19:08] in his great mind he wanted these
[1:19:10] attributes to be expressed
[1:19:12] in him
[1:19:13] was i like this first word
[1:19:17] love
[1:19:19] right
[1:19:23] in him was to be father
[1:19:27] amen like wednesday night
[1:19:29] alba
[1:19:30] father he wants that to be a daddy
[1:19:33] he wanted to have children
[1:19:37] amen
[1:19:38] another subject
[1:19:40] and him was to be his son
[1:19:42] and he was to be savior in him was to be
[1:19:45] healer and him was to be a deliverer and
[1:19:48] he was to be a mighty
[1:19:51] warrior
[1:19:54] oh my mighty in battle
[1:19:57] undefeated and disputed champion of the
[1:20:01] world
[1:20:04] how many is with me how many will root
[1:20:06] this champion on this morning say that's
[1:20:08] what i believe god is that's what i
[1:20:10] believe jesus is he is the undisputed
[1:20:13] undefeated champion of the world goliath
[1:20:18] wasn't the champion
[1:20:22] giant great big old goliath looked big
[1:20:25] but little david was bigger than the
[1:20:27] giant because somebody was in him
[1:20:33] a story i didn't tell you last sunday
[1:20:35] with the sermon that i was preaching and
[1:20:37] that is
[1:20:39] he that is in you
[1:20:41] i just thought about this story myself
[1:20:44] but
[1:20:45] it's like a little girl going down
[1:20:47] through the real bad part of town where
[1:20:50] it's a bunch of big old gangsters let's
[1:20:53] just say chicago because i would i don't
[1:20:55] know about you but i wouldn't even want
[1:20:57] to drive through that place would you
[1:21:00] not one weekend 64 wounded 10 dead
[1:21:05] folks you'd have to be on guard wouldn't
[1:21:08] you
[1:21:09] but going through the worst part of town
[1:21:12] some little girl goes down there
[1:21:14] and a whole bunch of gang members come
[1:21:16] out there with their machetes and their
[1:21:18] guns perhaps
[1:21:22] they say you can't go down this street
[1:21:24] this is our street she says get out of
[1:21:26] the way
[1:21:29] huh
[1:21:30] what do you think about that
[1:21:31] think she'd have a chance
[1:21:34] no but
[1:21:36] guess what if there was about 15 big old
[1:21:40] striping bodybuilders
[1:21:43] all right and they had strapped on them
[1:21:45] 50 cal machine guns that's you know just
[1:21:48] automatic
[1:21:52] she'd say i said
[1:21:54] for the last time get out about i'd
[1:21:57] imagine somebody would move
[1:22:00] don't you
[1:22:01] why because it's not who she is
[1:22:04] but who's with her
[1:22:06] how many believes that this morning it's
[1:22:08] not who you are
[1:22:11] but it's who's with you
[1:22:16] on the way to church i thought of one of
[1:22:17] the sweetest scriptures that i could
[1:22:19] think of and it's found in romans 8 amen
[1:22:23] the bible says therefore if god be
[1:22:26] with us who can be or for us who can be
[1:22:29] against us
[1:22:31] that is one wonderful scripture are you
[1:22:34] with me this morning
[1:22:45] just calm down now
[1:22:48] [Music]
[1:22:50] that all excites you
[1:22:54] question
[1:22:55] is he
[1:22:59] is he
[1:23:01] is he with you
[1:23:02] [Music]
[1:23:04] if he's not with you you can stay
[1:23:05] depressed
[1:23:06] you really ought to be depressed
[1:23:11] because it's depressing
[1:23:13] without him
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:15] life is a plan
[1:23:18] my it is
[1:23:20] uh well i don't know how to describe it
[1:23:22] but it's
[1:23:24] a bland taste just to jerry taste
[1:23:27] something just
[1:23:29] terrible tasting that's what life is
[1:23:30] without christ
[1:23:32] no salt
[1:23:34] how many please we're the salt of the
[1:23:36] earth
[1:23:37] but the salt has to make contact
[1:23:40] oh my
[1:23:42] think about it
[1:23:45] so brother bam says so the first thing
[1:23:47] in my opinion is he made angels and so
[1:23:49] forth he went on down
[1:23:51] son there wasn't the sun the moon was
[1:23:53] this that or the other and as he asked
[1:23:56] job job
[1:23:58] where was you when i laid the
[1:24:00] foundations of the world when the
[1:24:02] morning stars sang together and all the
[1:24:06] sons of god
[1:24:10] shouted for joy
[1:24:21] jesus heard that scream right there
[1:24:23] before the foundation of the world
[1:24:26] he knew that the sons of god were
[1:24:29] for god
[1:24:31] he's seen it in his mind he thought it
[1:24:33] in his mind
[1:24:35] before the first stylus was ever been
[1:24:37] where was you you was in the back part
[1:24:40] of my mind
[1:24:43] do you realize that whenever job was in
[1:24:45] the in the lowest part of his life in
[1:24:48] the pit of despair that that's what god
[1:24:51] said said job
[1:24:53] uh give up your loins like a man
[1:24:56] i got something to say to you where were
[1:24:58] you
[1:25:01] when i laid the foundation lord sons of
[1:25:03] god shouted for joy
[1:25:05] answer me today we've got the answer
[1:25:08] he was in his thinking before the
[1:25:11] foundation of the world
[1:25:13] you was a part of him why didn't they
[1:25:16] shout because that mighty warrior was
[1:25:18] going to come down and he was going to
[1:25:20] defeat every devil there is
[1:25:24] he was going to become our messiah he
[1:25:26] was going to be our savior our deliverer
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:38] oh my
[1:25:40] that's why we're so happy
[1:25:43] you would never have experienced him as
[1:25:46] a savior unless you was
[1:25:49] lost
[1:25:51] never as a deliverer unless she was in
[1:25:54] the pit somewhere there in my despair i
[1:25:57] cried so loved but he didn't hit me his
[1:25:59] but yet his hand reached further down
[1:26:01] then i could reach up
[1:26:03] it means everything to you
[1:26:09] praise be to god
[1:26:11] that's right 18 19 years old amen i
[1:26:15] didn't know which way to go what to do
[1:26:16] but there was something in my heart
[1:26:17] there's got to be a god out there
[1:26:19] somewhere
[1:26:20] god help me
[1:26:22] and he reached out
[1:26:25] and picked me up
[1:26:27] he brought me out of the miry clay i
[1:26:30] know him as savior i know him as messiah
[1:26:33] he is my savior
[1:26:38] oh
[1:26:40] what a savior oh
[1:26:44] what a savior somebody said oh
[1:26:47] what a savior
[1:26:49] is mine
[1:26:51] wonderful glorious
[1:26:56] isn't he
[1:26:57] he's wonderful he's glorious what a
[1:26:59] savior is mine
[1:27:05] boy if we could all repent of one thing
[1:27:07] this morning it is that this isn't real
[1:27:09] enough to it
[1:27:12] this just isn't real enough to me
[1:27:15] my senses to the reality of the savior
[1:27:18] and what god really
[1:27:20] is
[1:27:21] isn't real enough to me
[1:27:24] the appreciation of what he has done in
[1:27:26] my life and how he has
[1:27:28] delivered me from the hands how did he
[1:27:31] set the captain free
[1:27:33] this mighty warrior come and he set the
[1:27:36] captive free
[1:27:40] amen aren't you glad
[1:27:44] brother bad knows
[1:27:46] but it's hard to get free up here
[1:27:49] you've got to just kind of let go and
[1:27:51] let god have his way
[1:27:52] say lord come and
[1:27:54] you know
[1:27:55] folks i was just going to have a good
[1:27:56] teaching lesson this morning here i am
[1:27:58] screaming hollering just getting happy
[1:28:00] i'm sorry about that if you don't like
[1:28:01] that but not really sorry about it sorry
[1:28:03] if you don't like it they don't
[1:28:09] i'm having a good time maybe
[1:28:11] like brother bam said to that girl man
[1:28:13] you don't drink you don't smoke what do
[1:28:14] you do for a good time i go to church to
[1:28:16] have a good time
[1:28:18] all you depressed people out there why
[1:28:20] don't you have a good time sometimes
[1:28:21] come on to church
[1:28:25] how many believe that that's right
[1:28:27] that's a place where we can come into
[1:28:29] heaven
[1:28:30] like there ain't no telling books
[1:28:34] ain't no telling what might happen
[1:28:37] we've got to deliver our heritage but
[1:28:39] he's still the same as he ever was
[1:28:45] do you can you imagine what churches is
[1:28:47] gonna be like when the holy spirit
[1:28:49] leaves
[1:28:51] well now we are gathered here this
[1:28:54] morning once again
[1:29:08] look on the chandeliers and there's
[1:29:10] icebergs hanging down it's cold
[1:29:16] stiff
[1:29:17] people took put too much starch in their
[1:29:20] shirt i mean lives
[1:29:22] and they've come all stiff
[1:29:24] you can't move the lips hardly it's so
[1:29:26] cold
[1:29:28] huh
[1:29:32] no amens no hallelujah
[1:29:36] no
[1:29:36] praise
[1:29:38] hallelujah
[1:29:40] that's what happened when the holy ghost
[1:29:42] goes
[1:29:43] you become cold and formal and
[1:29:45] indifferent
[1:29:50] i thank god that he's still here
[1:29:53] god is still here god is still god
[1:29:57] he's still in the saving business
[1:30:00] all right
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] so we find out that that's where we was
[1:30:10] he knew every one of you that would make
[1:30:11] it to church this morning
[1:30:13] he knew where you would choose to sit
[1:30:16] huh
[1:30:18] now a lot of us have kind of our spots
[1:30:20] right
[1:30:22] amen but god knew all of this he knew
[1:30:26] why that he would lay this on my heart
[1:30:28] maybe somebody needs it right
[1:30:30] lay this on my heart to talk about him
[1:30:34] to pray on him
[1:30:37] to talk about who he not just was
[1:30:41] but is
[1:30:43] and is to come
[1:30:44] you know what he said he was
[1:30:46] i'm he which was and is and is to come
[1:30:50] he's everything
[1:30:52] and let me think about him
[1:30:56] the great mighty
[1:30:58] warrior
[1:31:00] moyer a warrior
[1:31:04] that comes and fights a battle
[1:31:07] to deliver you
[1:31:09] because you're a captive
[1:31:11] right
[1:31:12] that's what his purpose is
[1:31:14] to come and take you away from the
[1:31:16] clutches of the pawn shop
[1:31:19] of the devil
[1:31:21] to bring you to true freedom
[1:31:24] oh my
[1:31:28] what did what say about freedom he says
[1:31:30] americans think they're free he says
[1:31:31] steering more bondage into communists
[1:31:35] because what did he say he says freedom
[1:31:37] is not about having the freedom out here
[1:31:38] in the flesh real freedom is being free
[1:31:41] in here
[1:31:42] this is true freedom
[1:31:45] amen
[1:31:50] so let's look at christ for just a
[1:31:51] minute let's go on down now
[1:31:53] move into christ's life and talk about
[1:31:56] how perfect he is
[1:31:58] now that he was never
[1:32:00] defeated
[1:32:02] amen
[1:32:04] he is a warrior
[1:32:07] that's mighty in battle
[1:32:10] in the old testament we know that
[1:32:12] almighty god come down in moses right
[1:32:14] and he'd just take a stick
[1:32:17] and it wasn't moses or the stick it was
[1:32:19] god
[1:32:20] when he set out to deliver to israelites
[1:32:23] they got deliberate
[1:32:26] amen
[1:32:27] many times
[1:32:29] god
[1:32:30] was perfect
[1:32:32] when he challenged the devil
[1:32:35] in a duel
[1:32:37] with his servant job
[1:32:39] and that right
[1:32:41] god won superiorly there
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:45] because why job held his integrity
[1:32:49] amen
[1:32:52] what about the apostle paul
[1:32:55] amen paul had shipwrecks he had beatings
[1:32:58] he had all kinds of obstacles he had all
[1:33:00] kinds of things
[1:33:02] but he was never defeated because even
[1:33:04] in death
[1:33:07] he said we are more than conquerors
[1:33:10] through him that love us
[1:33:12] like brother ben said we're not just
[1:33:14] survivors
[1:33:16] we're victorious
[1:33:18] bible says we're more than just
[1:33:20] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:33:24] amen
[1:33:26] praise be to god
[1:33:28] i've heard this by different ministers
[1:33:30] and i'm going to say it again i think
[1:33:31] it's good
[1:33:32] born a conqueror
[1:33:34] is it's like muhammad ali
[1:33:37] i want to use well i hate to use him
[1:33:39] because he went away from christianity
[1:33:42] to the buddha or one of those others
[1:33:44] muhammad or whatever i don't like
[1:33:46] anybody that leaves christianity and
[1:33:47] goes some other religion huh
[1:33:50] but
[1:33:51] he would go out there and fight that
[1:33:53] fight come on home and hand that check
[1:33:56] to his wife
[1:33:59] thank you honey
[1:34:01] huh
[1:34:02] she was more than a conqueror she didn't
[1:34:04] have to be in it she just received it
[1:34:05] enjoyed it how many knows that's what
[1:34:07] jesus did for you and me
[1:34:09] he fought the battle he cried and
[1:34:12] yosemite tear drops of blood amen and
[1:34:15] just i was a terrible paddle the
[1:34:17] greatest battle he fought was in the
[1:34:19] garden of gethsemane over his own will
[1:34:23] how many knows the great
[1:34:25] this battle your fight is in your own
[1:34:27] mind
[1:34:28] over your own will that's the hardest
[1:34:31] guy to conquer is yourself
[1:34:35] that's your greatest battle
[1:34:38] well this morning last brother bam said
[1:34:40] many times let go and let god out of his
[1:34:42] way
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:44] how many bleeds was sitting in the
[1:34:45] infused every one of us could loosen up
[1:34:47] a little
[1:34:48] that's right we could all just kind of
[1:34:51] not be so comfortable because it's so
[1:34:53] easy to be comfortable
[1:34:55] huh
[1:34:57] i was told that some preachers in the
[1:34:58] past had his congregation sit on rocks
[1:35:01] didn't want him to be comfortable too
[1:35:02] much why we'd be up and friends be to
[1:35:05] god that prayer you know i can't sit
[1:35:07] there no more
[1:35:12] stand up worst of the lord
[1:35:14] not to be too comfortable
[1:35:16] amen but thank god for the comfortable
[1:35:18] seats but
[1:35:19] just enter in what i'm trying to say is
[1:35:21] how many believe we could enter in a
[1:35:23] little more
[1:35:24] yeah i know i could lord help us
[1:35:28] amen
[1:35:30] so how many knows in this life it's
[1:35:32] either lose or win
[1:35:35] there's not really any draws
[1:35:37] you either lose your battles or you win
[1:35:40] your battles
[1:35:41] you're either victorious or you're
[1:35:43] defeated
[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:46] and jesus was never defeated i guess one
[1:35:49] of the first place that we find
[1:35:51] that jesus fighting
[1:35:53] because we know that he uh
[1:35:57] came up the legion there's a whole
[1:35:59] legion of them right
[1:36:01] 2000 or something
[1:36:04] brother brad talked about him a couple
[1:36:05] weeks ago but it's a bunch of devils
[1:36:08] right and he defeated every one of them
[1:36:13] they went out into the swine
[1:36:19] can i put you a little question mark in
[1:36:21] your mind this morning
[1:36:26] i don't know that those devils wanted to
[1:36:28] go into the swine
[1:36:31] to die
[1:36:33] but the pigs probably got so miserable
[1:36:35] with on them they went ahead and killed
[1:36:37] themselves
[1:36:38] i would rather be dead in the ocean than
[1:36:40] to have this thing on me
[1:36:41] huh
[1:36:43] there were wicked devils
[1:36:46] and jesus cast them out no matter what
[1:36:48] jesus came up against
[1:36:50] he was always victorious
[1:36:55] how many knows he came up to the devil
[1:36:57] himself
[1:36:58] came up to the devil himself no doubt he
[1:37:00] had met him back because jesus was
[1:37:03] before i come from god and i go back to
[1:37:05] god
[1:37:06] before abraham was i am right so now
[1:37:10] that is jesus back there with job
[1:37:13] making that challenge and so forth
[1:37:15] so when the devil come to him on the
[1:37:17] mountain there begin to tell him and try
[1:37:19] to tempt him to make bread
[1:37:22] trump off the pinnacle of the building
[1:37:24] and so forth all these temptations that
[1:37:26] he attempted him with he was victorious
[1:37:29] in every one of them
[1:37:31] it don't matter if there was blindness
[1:37:33] he opened up the blind
[1:37:36] right
[1:37:37] the death could hear
[1:37:39] like i said
[1:37:41] peter and them
[1:37:44] didn't have the faith that they needed
[1:37:46] because in faith real genuine faith of
[1:37:49] god knows no defeat
[1:37:51] it's not defeated
[1:37:53] people have an intellectual and
[1:37:54] everything else
[1:37:56] the reason i say that is because i know
[1:37:58] that peter and them had faith to do a
[1:37:59] lot of miracles right but it came to the
[1:38:01] epileptic child remember they didn't
[1:38:03] couldn't cast him out
[1:38:05] and
[1:38:07] they said why couldn't we do it what did
[1:38:09] jesus say
[1:38:10] because of the lack of your faith
[1:38:14] because of your faith that's what he
[1:38:15] said
[1:38:17] because if you had a faith the greater
[1:38:18] must receive right if you'd had the
[1:38:20] right kind of faith it would have
[1:38:21] happened how many believes that applies
[1:38:23] to every one of us
[1:38:24] if you're going to be completely
[1:38:25] victorious you have to have the right
[1:38:27] kind of faith
[1:38:29] but jesus he went there and he wasn't
[1:38:31] defeated
[1:38:33] no he wasn't defeated
[1:38:36] he threw that devil out he healed that
[1:38:38] person and of course you know they
[1:38:40] foamed at the mouth to think and throw
[1:38:41] themselves the dead and they thought he
[1:38:43] was dead he had been so bad but after
[1:38:45] that he raised up and was normal
[1:38:49] amen
[1:38:51] how about death
[1:38:53] now before even jesus died and rose
[1:38:55] again jesus conquered death long before
[1:38:58] he died
[1:39:03] how many knows how he did it
[1:39:08] how did jesus conquer death before he
[1:39:10] died
[1:39:13] lazarus is the answer
[1:39:15] lazarus was dead
[1:39:18] right and jesus spoke
[1:39:20] and conquered death right there
[1:39:25] come forth and came forth that's
[1:39:26] conquering death
[1:39:28] amen
[1:39:31] that's right
[1:39:32] so even death could not stand in the way
[1:39:34] of christ
[1:39:36] why do you think over in revelations he
[1:39:38] told john fear not
[1:39:41] i am he which liveth and was dead and am
[1:39:44] alive forevermore
[1:39:47] why because he conquered
[1:39:49] he conquered himself at the at the
[1:39:52] garden of gethsemane and then he went to
[1:39:54] the cross
[1:39:56] you say well to the world it looked like
[1:39:58] a defeat didn't it
[1:40:00] the disciples let me tell you something
[1:40:02] the disciples every last one of the
[1:40:04] disciples were in the pit of despair
[1:40:09] they were in the
[1:40:10] bottom of of depression
[1:40:13] how many knows that people are so
[1:40:15] depressed i'm going
[1:40:16] get this i'm going fishing
[1:40:19] and when people try to tell them hey
[1:40:20] he's alive he wouldn't even believe him
[1:40:23] right
[1:40:25] mary he tried to tell him he's alive no
[1:40:27] i don't believe it
[1:40:28] thomas he was a real doubter
[1:40:34] i will say this about thomas
[1:40:37] thomas may have been a daughter
[1:40:39] but he knew who god was
[1:40:41] he had the godhead right
[1:40:45] he had the godhead right when he touched
[1:40:47] his hands he fell down what did he say
[1:40:49] my lord
[1:40:50] and my god
[1:40:54] a lot of people ain't got that right
[1:40:57] amen
[1:40:59] wouldn't even believe it
[1:41:01] peter and
[1:41:02] them oh my
[1:41:06] how depressed
[1:41:08] they were because of what looked like
[1:41:11] everything had fallen apart
[1:41:14] my
[1:41:15] my
[1:41:16] god has to bring us to those places
[1:41:20] a lot of us have been to those places to
[1:41:21] where boy it really couldn't get any
[1:41:25] worse
[1:41:30] oh yeah brother branham was there too
[1:41:33] couldn't get any worse when his wife
[1:41:36] died and he was begging
[1:41:38] for his little daughter sharon rose
[1:41:41] begging for her little baby
[1:41:44] forgot not to take her and that black
[1:41:46] sheep come in front of him god would not
[1:41:48] hear his prayer
[1:41:54] amen but you know what the glorious part
[1:41:57] about it
[1:41:58] was oh my
[1:42:00] when did when when that other doctor
[1:42:03] i'm not sure what his name was but
[1:42:05] the doctor the friend of his
[1:42:08] asked him he says you know he says did
[1:42:10] you hold your religion
[1:42:12] did you keep your religion during all
[1:42:14] this hard time
[1:42:15] is that a good question we gotta ask
[1:42:17] ourselves during that really really
[1:42:20] really low time
[1:42:22] what what happened
[1:42:24] and he says no
[1:42:26] but it kept me
[1:42:29] because how many knows if it had been
[1:42:30] brother branham he probably spoke
[1:42:32] against it
[1:42:33] but there was something in there that
[1:42:35] kept him from saying it there's
[1:42:37] something in there said well the lord
[1:42:39] gave the lord taken away blessed be the
[1:42:42] name of the lord
[1:42:44] i believe every son of god brother baby
[1:42:46] talked about every child of god that
[1:42:48] comes to god so get ready folks
[1:42:51] if you're a child of god son of god
[1:42:52] sooner or later sometime in your life
[1:42:55] no doubt god is going to take you to the
[1:42:57] very bottom of the bottom
[1:42:59] and that's where we'll find what you're
[1:43:01] made out of
[1:43:02] we'll find out if it's you
[1:43:05] or if it's him in you
[1:43:07] amen the difference will be if he's in
[1:43:09] you you'll be all right you'll make it
[1:43:12] you'll come up out of there because he
[1:43:14] is the one that triumphs he's the mighty
[1:43:17] conqueror
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:22] aren't you glad that you have we have a
[1:43:24] perfect one
[1:43:26] folks you can look at each other we can
[1:43:27] look at the prophet of god and you can
[1:43:29] say that's not perfect folks
[1:43:32] i don't know about you but after i lost
[1:43:34] my wife after i lost my baby because i
[1:43:36] disobeyed god
[1:43:38] how many knows he disobeyed again in
[1:43:40] africa
[1:43:42] and he went up when he got when god said
[1:43:44] don't go up he's stealing up to another
[1:43:46] area a guy had told none he went back
[1:43:48] home and he was sick for years
[1:43:50] he was sick for years because of it
[1:43:53] paid dearly second time around
[1:43:57] that's right
[1:43:58] but the good part about this prophetic
[1:44:00] god is if he was fallible he was full of
[1:44:02] failures
[1:44:04] but he would confess it and he would
[1:44:05] admit it
[1:44:06] so that we could learn from it
[1:44:09] and not do it whether it was a simple
[1:44:11] thing of of lying on the telephone
[1:44:14] right
[1:44:15] simple things like that he exposed he
[1:44:17] said yeah that's right
[1:44:18] so why we you know there's the christ in
[1:44:22] him we follow we follow that amen but we
[1:44:25] don't follow his failures we learn from
[1:44:28] his failures
[1:44:29] that's the way it is with any leader
[1:44:31] and when you follow the christ in him
[1:44:34] not the failures in him
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:38] because that's the same way with our
[1:44:40] children what if our children looked on
[1:44:41] us seeing our failures and they follow
[1:44:44] our failures it wouldn't be good would
[1:44:45] it
[1:44:46] no let the children if you see faults in
[1:44:48] your parents be patient pray for them
[1:44:50] but follow the good amen
[1:44:53] all right
[1:44:55] i love that
[1:44:57] conquered legions of demons and so forth
[1:45:00] epilepsy blindness and so forth because
[1:45:03] you know what how many know that
[1:45:05] death
[1:45:07] is the biggest enemy
[1:45:09] what bigger devil what bigger enemy are
[1:45:12] you going to fight than death itself
[1:45:17] healing that's smaller
[1:45:20] hey you might have a cancer that might
[1:45:21] eat you up in six months but
[1:45:23] you know go to church get prayed for it
[1:45:26] goes away you're fine
[1:45:28] but it's not as big as being dead
[1:45:31] because i don't know about you but most
[1:45:32] of the time
[1:45:33] i kind of look at it long and still
[1:45:35] alive they're so
[1:45:37] but i shouldn't look at it like that
[1:45:38] there's hope after today if you can
[1:45:40] believe
[1:45:42] amen oh my i know what we're all
[1:45:45] thinking but that's kind of hard to
[1:45:46] believe but it's the truth anyway
[1:45:50] so what did we do we looked at what the
[1:45:51] prophet and how he said it how he went
[1:45:54] to calvary and how that they thought
[1:45:55] that he was a a defeat when he went to
[1:45:58] calgary and when he got killed
[1:46:00] how many knows that was the farthest
[1:46:03] thing from defeat
[1:46:06] it would have been complete defeat if he
[1:46:09] wouldn't have went
[1:46:10] are you with me
[1:46:12] because the devil wanted anything but
[1:46:14] for him to pay the price
[1:46:16] he wanted to give him the kingdom
[1:46:18] without him paying for it
[1:46:21] then he still had rights on it but if he
[1:46:24] pays the price for it he owns it
[1:46:27] i mean that's why abraham would not take
[1:46:30] that uh
[1:46:31] graveyard that he bought for free they
[1:46:34] wanted to just give it to him but he
[1:46:35] says i'm paying you for it
[1:46:37] i'm gonna own it i want to own it
[1:46:41] that's the way the lord is he paid for
[1:46:43] our price
[1:46:44] that way he can own you we are bought
[1:46:46] with the price you are not your own
[1:46:52] whoa how many sled for that you are not
[1:46:54] your own boss
[1:46:56] you can't do what you want
[1:46:59] you have a master that you serve
[1:47:01] we have a heavenly father we have a
[1:47:03] warrior that we follow
[1:47:05] we have a captain that we follow
[1:47:08] amen
[1:47:10] it was the greatest victory
[1:47:13] of all time
[1:47:17] the battle was
[1:47:19] don't you know that i could call so many
[1:47:21] legions of angels 10 legions i guess for
[1:47:24] so many legions of angels right now that
[1:47:26] could change the whole thing but i've
[1:47:29] got to overcome that
[1:47:31] i've got to overcome not my will but
[1:47:34] then be done if it be possible let this
[1:47:36] cup pass from me
[1:47:39] you talk about coming down to the door
[1:47:41] of death and then having been a struggle
[1:47:43] with the lord
[1:47:44] that's right you're gonna have to go
[1:47:46] through this he's gonna have to be beat
[1:47:47] unrecognizable
[1:47:50] he's going to have to suffer like nobody
[1:47:52] suffered
[1:47:53] he's going to have to be forsaken by
[1:47:55] everybody who stayed with him
[1:47:58] anybody stay with him
[1:48:00] no no no
[1:48:01] his church left him his entire church
[1:48:03] left him
[1:48:05] he was all by himself
[1:48:07] having to go face death by himself peter
[1:48:09] hiding back out there somewhere
[1:48:12] warming himself
[1:48:14] by a fire trying to get a little
[1:48:16] something to eat because he had done you
[1:48:18] know betrayed him
[1:48:21] amen
[1:48:24] said i don't know i don't know and
[1:48:27] lied three times he did know him
[1:48:31] there he was by himself but he went up
[1:48:33] there
[1:48:34] suffered
[1:48:36] oh my
[1:48:38] i like i like what
[1:48:40] jesus said the pilot i believe it was
[1:48:42] don't you realize i have the power to
[1:48:44] release you
[1:48:47] and jesus says you wouldn't have any
[1:48:48] power
[1:48:50] zero power
[1:48:51] if daddy wouldn't have given it to you
[1:48:56] the father hadn't given it to you you'd
[1:48:58] have no power
[1:49:00] and what did jesus say no man
[1:49:03] taketh
[1:49:04] my life
[1:49:05] i
[1:49:07] give it
[1:49:11] he gave it freely
[1:49:16] who did he give it for
[1:49:20] the ones that he knew
[1:49:22] would want it
[1:49:24] he says only to redeemed or even consid
[1:49:27] considered in redemption right only the
[1:49:30] predestination even considered those who
[1:49:32] before knew would want it
[1:49:35] the others would never want in the first
[1:49:36] place he didn't die for them he knew
[1:49:38] they wouldn't want it but he died
[1:49:39] because of the people he knew would want
[1:49:42] it
[1:49:42] that's why if you raise your hand you
[1:49:44] can say thank you lord jesus
[1:49:46] i
[1:49:46] want it
[1:49:48] i
[1:49:49] need a savior i need a warrior that will
[1:49:52] fight every devil fight himself fight
[1:49:54] his own will and then go to the cross
[1:49:57] and give his life
[1:49:59] a ransom
[1:50:00] for many the bible says
[1:50:02] oh that was a mighty war a mightiest
[1:50:04] warrior ever
[1:50:06] how many members the story of napoleon
[1:50:09] and jesus 33 years old died
[1:50:11] right
[1:50:12] he went down
[1:50:13] there let me finish this story we'll
[1:50:15] pick up the podium in a minute but think
[1:50:17] about that he went up there and he oh my
[1:50:19] the pain
[1:50:20] during all of the pain
[1:50:23] every stripe everything was put on there
[1:50:25] amen and i don't imagine
[1:50:27] that they had to grab jesus's hand and
[1:50:29] pull it out he probably laid it over
[1:50:31] there
[1:50:32] where do you want it right there right
[1:50:34] there laid it freely stretched out his
[1:50:35] hand as they put the nails in his hand
[1:50:39] and as they took and put that big old
[1:50:44] piece of steel
[1:50:46] put his one foot over top of the other
[1:50:48] one something like that
[1:50:49] and drove it through both of them
[1:50:52] right down and
[1:50:53] man took that sledgehammer and drove it
[1:50:55] down into that wood it wasn't coming off
[1:50:59] uh same way with the hands no doubt had
[1:51:01] a big uh
[1:51:03] big head on it

[1:51:10] sister chinese he was thinking about you
[1:51:14] thinking about you thinking about each
[1:51:16] and every one of us
[1:51:19] amen as they nailed him there who was he
[1:51:21] thinking about
[1:51:23] you and me
[1:51:24] that would need victory that would need
[1:51:26] him to fight our battles for us in this
[1:51:28] age
[1:51:30] and this time
[1:51:31] martin luther john wesley all the
[1:51:33] brother brand of all of them that
[1:51:34] they're all gone now now the battle's
[1:51:36] with you and me now we need him as a
[1:51:38] warrior we need him as a deliverer as a
[1:51:42] messiah
[1:51:43] amen a savior
[1:51:45] the savior from this world a savior from
[1:51:48] this layout at cih
[1:51:50] a savior from this lukewarmness
[1:51:54] this depressing age
[1:51:58] amen
[1:52:00] can i have another 10 minutes
[1:52:02] i'm going to go 10 minutes because i
[1:52:04] want to tell you about this savior
[1:52:05] messiah because that's what a savior is
[1:52:08] a savior is somebody that is like a
[1:52:10] deliverer saves people amen
[1:52:12] we know that i had it in my and i had
[1:52:15] pulled it up just the meaning of it but
[1:52:17] it talks about like the jews were
[1:52:18] looking to be for him to be their savior
[1:52:20] to save him you know from so forth but
[1:52:22] you know in the christian world it says
[1:52:25] that they believed him to be the savior
[1:52:27] this messiah is the savior of mankind of
[1:52:31] all mankind
[1:52:32] to deliver us the mighty warrior
[1:52:36] amen
[1:52:38] so every pain he put it in there and
[1:52:40] then
[1:52:41] it got so bad
[1:52:44] it hurt so bad
[1:52:47] being rejected by all of mankind
[1:52:50] can you imagine the very god that made
[1:52:52] all of mankind
[1:52:55] there's only one perhaps one or so
[1:52:58] that stood with him
[1:53:00] that was mary going along and saying
[1:53:01] what has he done what has he done what
[1:53:04] has he done but good why are you doing
[1:53:06] this huh
[1:53:08] mama wasn't ashamed of him
[1:53:10] mama followed him along
[1:53:13] but just maybe her
[1:53:16] that's it
[1:53:18] and he says he died of a broken heart
[1:53:21] died of a broken heart
[1:53:23] and they were coming over there to break
[1:53:25] his legs
[1:53:26] they looked he was dead already
[1:53:29] he says well let's not do that because
[1:53:30] the bible says not one bone of him will
[1:53:32] be broken
[1:53:34] they could i'll tell you what they could
[1:53:35] have swung that thing as hard as they
[1:53:37] wanted to
[1:53:38] that angel's hand would have been there
[1:53:40] it'd never hit
[1:53:41] i mean believe that
[1:53:43] because i'm here to tell you we have
[1:53:44] angels watching over us
[1:53:48] but they said that he's already dead and
[1:53:49] so they just took a spear and put it up
[1:53:51] in his side right up under his rib cage
[1:53:53] somewhere in here probably liver area
[1:53:55] and somewhere in there water and blood
[1:53:58] gushed out
[1:54:01] how many believes that that when that
[1:54:03] water and that blood gushed out
[1:54:05] it went down on the earth in the dirt
[1:54:09] and he prayed the price to redeem this
[1:54:12] very planet
[1:54:13] this planet became his
[1:54:17] immediately bought it he bought in me
[1:54:21] he purchased our salvation on calvary
[1:54:23] straight
[1:54:25] the greatest warrior ever
[1:54:28] when he came up to the scribes and the
[1:54:30] pharisees these intellectual giants
[1:54:32] when he came up against them
[1:54:35] they try to catch him in his word
[1:54:37] like uh with the woman that was caught
[1:54:38] in the very act hey the law says do it
[1:54:42] well he's gonna have to be real smart
[1:54:43] now
[1:54:44] because the law says do it right
[1:54:48] but they were messing with the fountain
[1:54:50] of wisdom
[1:54:51] the very one that formed the alphabet
[1:54:55] he knew exactly what to write on the
[1:54:57] sand he knew exactly how to bend down
[1:54:59] and write what to say he knew exactly
[1:55:01] the words to say when he says he that is
[1:55:04] without sin
[1:55:06] cast the first stone
[1:55:10] i don't know about you but i know what
[1:55:11] it's like to have conviction come over
[1:55:13] you
[1:55:14] sometimes conviction will come over you
[1:55:15] in the congregation man you just want to
[1:55:17] run to the altar and say god that's
[1:55:19] right that's right that's me and all i
[1:55:21] know about that folks i believe there
[1:55:22] was such conviction on all of them they
[1:55:24] seen all the sins they had ever done
[1:55:26] is this boy i sure ain't worried i can
[1:55:28] no way i can
[1:55:30] i can throw a stone
[1:55:33] amen
[1:55:36] conquered everything went down
[1:55:39] gave up the ghost
[1:55:41] right
[1:55:44] the holy spirit left
[1:55:47] he left him and he died
[1:55:49] his spirit left
[1:55:51] and where did it go
[1:55:54] down the hill
[1:55:56] down to the regions of the lost
[1:56:00] the bible says that he preached to the
[1:56:02] souls that were in prison
[1:56:05] he come down there
[1:56:07] and preached to noah's group the
[1:56:10] andeluvian people
[1:56:12] right all those over there that didn't
[1:56:14] believe and he says i am he that was to
[1:56:16] come here i am
[1:56:18] can you imagine
[1:56:20] can you imagine how they feel down there
[1:56:22] right now knowing that yeah he did it
[1:56:24] was true
[1:56:26] it was true and he's going to come back
[1:56:28] there's going to be a judgment not going
[1:56:29] to be damned
[1:56:31] huh
[1:56:33] that has to make that region even worse
[1:56:35] right now for all of them
[1:56:37] but that's the prophet of god he says he
[1:56:38] come down there and down there was the
[1:56:41] devil
[1:56:43] the regions of hades
[1:56:45] he comes walking down through there
[1:56:47] [Music]
[1:56:48] blood still wet on calvary
[1:56:52] and as the prophet put it he says ah you

[1:57:43] death means total separation from god he
[1:57:46] took the keys of being separated from

[1:58:53] i'm just glad that he came at his
[1:58:55] picture taken with his prophet in this
[1:58:57] generation right here a pillar of fire
[1:59:01] he's alive he truly is resurrected
[1:59:05] oh my
[1:59:07] think about that
[1:59:10] rose up
[1:59:12] and then he went to paradise with the
[1:59:14] keys
[1:59:15] and he unlocked wherever they were i
[1:59:18] don't understand just where it was but
[1:59:19] it was a place where it was called
[1:59:20] paradise
[1:59:22] abraham and isaac and all that were
[1:59:24] saved they were kind of locked in a
[1:59:26] certain place can't go on higher and he
[1:59:29] took them up into a higher place let
[1:59:31] them all come out
[1:59:34] some of them were seen in the streets
[1:59:36] isn't that right
[1:59:39] and within that three days
[1:59:42] within three days
[1:59:44] one of those times
[1:59:46] the clock tick tock tick tock tick tock
[1:59:52] huh
[1:59:55] it was ticking he was talking
[1:59:57] as mary was walking
[1:59:59] towards the sepulcher
[2:00:02] to bring flowers and spices
[2:00:04] and to see the place where he had been
[2:00:06] laid
[2:00:06] to go visit the grave
[2:00:09] but by the time she got there
[2:00:13] time was up
[2:00:15] he come up back up
[2:00:20] got a glorified body
[2:00:22] his body become glorified is that right
[2:00:26] someday the bible says we're going to
[2:00:27] have a body like unto his own glorious
[2:00:29] body
[2:00:30] these body that's why i believe in
[2:00:32] resurrection i believe those bodies
[2:00:33] change
[2:00:35] i don't believe that the third has to
[2:00:37] fly anywhere
[2:00:38] i believe they could go right through
[2:00:39] the dirt
[2:00:41] huh because brother bam says not like
[2:00:43] you're going to be
[2:00:44] thinking that it is a bunch of graves
[2:00:46] being open
[2:00:47] huh don't need all that why because he
[2:00:50] walked through walls
[2:00:51] go right through stuff but it'll be
[2:00:52] glorified he was rose and
[2:00:56] mary came there and
[2:00:57] formulated where is he
[2:01:00] amen and jesus made himself known to her
[2:01:03] is that right
[2:01:04] and she ran
[2:01:06] said he has triumphant
[2:01:09] the bible says that
[2:01:10] he went
[2:01:11] up far
[2:01:13] above all power above all principalities
[2:01:17] amen
[2:01:19] above all authority
[2:01:24] what do you think about churches that
[2:01:25] have to close pretty much permanently
[2:01:27] in other countries
[2:01:29] under the name of covet
[2:01:33] kind of scary isn't it
[2:01:35] don't you know that's what they'd like
[2:01:37] just shut down until it's all over with
[2:01:38] how many years will that be who do we
[2:01:40] obey
[2:01:42] huh
[2:01:43] because it's coming fast to the place to
[2:01:45] where you either have to be a god or man
[2:01:48] huh
[2:01:50] but he rose and he was triumphant
[2:01:53] over death hell and the grave
[2:01:59] and as the song says
[2:02:01] oh behold the mighty conquer
[2:02:03] behold him in plain view
[2:02:06] for he is the mighty conqueror since he
[2:02:09] what
[2:02:10] he rent the veil
[2:02:12] in two
[2:02:14] amen
[2:02:16] brother bam tells us about great
[2:02:18] soldiers great warriors people like and
[2:02:20] he talked about hitler even that was
[2:02:22] supposed to be a messiah
[2:02:24] to the german people
[2:02:26] japan wants a messiah he says the church
[2:02:28] is one of messiah they want a superman
[2:02:31] somebody that can you know way out to
[2:02:34] everybody else
[2:02:36] napoleon he was a great warrior
[2:02:39] took all the known world by the time he
[2:02:41] was 33 when he was 17 he believed in
[2:02:44] prohibition no drinking and all of that
[2:02:46] by the time he was done conquering
[2:02:48] everything else he says he was a drunk
[2:02:50] and had 1600 harlots following his army
[2:02:55] not much of a man
[2:02:57] and he met his water low
[2:02:59] not defeated
[2:03:01] because he didn't do it right amen
[2:03:05] and died drunk
[2:03:07] what a terrible way to go at 33
[2:03:09] but jesus christ at 33 conquered death
[2:03:12] hell and the grave for you and
[2:03:16] me

[2:05:50] paper here you was going to expose me
[2:05:52] tonight just then i waited a few minutes
[2:05:55] and i felt that spirit coming around
[2:05:58] and i said it wasn't the fbi i'm no
[2:06:01] criminal i said every time an fbi agent
[2:06:04] come in my meeting they got saved
[2:06:07] even their chief got saved in my meeting
[2:06:10] captain alvarez and that's oh i said no

[2:06:16] and i said what it is it's two
[2:06:19] backslidden
[2:06:21] preachers
[2:06:24] i looked hanging out there and there was
[2:06:27] a great big black thing hanging over the
[2:06:28] audience nice to see music move right up
[2:06:31] like this to the secondary battle
[2:06:33] balcony and i said right there said uh
[2:06:36] one with a light suit on one with a gray
[2:06:40] suit on they get then they got down like
[2:06:43] that ducking down and i says don't get
[2:06:45] down
[2:06:46] i thought you was going to expose me
[2:06:48] look like everybody
[2:06:49] looked like somebody else and i says a
[2:06:51] couple of back you're a couple of
[2:06:53] backslidden preachers
[2:06:55] you got nothing to do with it and i says
[2:06:57] now if i am simon the sorcerer casting
[2:06:59] out devils from witchcraft as you say i
[2:07:02] am
[2:07:02] and you're you're holy and righteous in
[2:07:05] god come down to the platform and if i'm
[2:07:08] the simon the sorcerer
[2:07:10] i will fall dead
[2:07:13] and if you're
[2:07:14] if you're the one that's wrong
[2:07:16] you'll fall dead
[2:07:23] see the warrior folks
[2:07:25] don't play bring the sword you want to
[2:07:28] cut we'll cut
[2:07:31] you'll fall dead come on down now we'll
[2:07:33] see who's right
[2:07:35] how many knows that's exactly what would
[2:07:38] have happened
[2:07:39] because the aim of the lord remember the
[2:07:41] angel of the lord never left brother
[2:07:44] branham whether he was in his hotel or
[2:07:46] wherever the angel lord was like joshua
[2:07:48] the first chapter he says i will be with
[2:07:50] you and no man shall ever stand before
[2:07:53] thee
[2:07:54] i mean that's the way it was with the
[2:07:56] prophet it didn't matter if it's
[2:07:57] witchcraft over in germany where they
[2:07:59] had the tent blowing away and they were
[2:08:01] bringing all kinds of witchcraft he in
[2:08:03] the name of the lord stopped it all
[2:08:05] hundreds of times in places where the
[2:08:07] witches and the different ones would try
[2:08:09] to withstand
[2:08:10] god
[2:08:11] but he defeated him every time 70
[2:08:14] ministers in chicago tried to withstand
[2:08:16] god in this generation and there was a
[2:08:19] trap blade for him isn't that right said
[2:08:21] they were going to question him on the
[2:08:22] godhead water baptism and serpent seed
[2:08:26] and brother ram says to the front of his
[2:08:28] he says you're not going to have the
[2:08:29] room that you have now
[2:08:31] you know
[2:08:32] i know what's going on and there's going
[2:08:33] to be a certain person a certain lady
[2:08:34] sitting over here with certain clothes
[2:08:36] on this side of the other and then that
[2:08:38] time it happened just exactly like that
[2:08:39] and that man came up and said now y'all
[2:08:41] can question brother random if you want
[2:08:42] to but he told me that person was going
[2:08:44] to be there he told me we wouldn't have
[2:08:45] another room this out of the other and
[2:08:47] they knew god was with him and then
[2:08:50] brother ben says come on up
[2:08:52] come stand by my side because the angel
[2:08:54] had told him to go down there i'll be by
[2:08:56] your side is what the angel told the law
[2:08:59] but told brother adam
[2:09:02] you know what would happen if you come
[2:09:03] into the angel spot it ain't gonna be a
[2:09:05] good thing
[2:09:08] amen that was another mighty battle
[2:09:10] isn't that right
[2:09:11] but anyway so to finish this story
[2:09:15] oh my let's see who's who that's right
[2:09:18] if i be falsely again god you'll show it
[2:09:20] falsely if i'm right god will always
[2:09:21] testify to the right
[2:09:23] amen
[2:09:24] now listen
[2:09:28] you are uh you know and then i said now
[2:09:31] listen
[2:09:33] come on down he said and we'll see who's
[2:09:35] right that's right
[2:09:36] put them to a challenge they kept their
[2:09:38] head down i said don't duck your head
[2:09:43] i like that don't be ducking your head
[2:09:45] back up there
[2:09:47] they were trying to hide
[2:09:50] all right like that and i said now
[2:09:52] people you see who's in the right and
[2:09:54] who's in the wrong
[2:09:55] they were scared and they went out over
[2:09:58] the top over there just as hard as they
[2:10:00] could
[2:10:01] and i said oh i see they're leaving
[2:10:03] perhaps they're coming on down here
[2:10:05] they went out of the building just as
[2:10:07] hard as they could down the steps i
[2:10:09] stood there and i waited i said now
[2:10:12] we'll just see let them come to the
[2:10:13] platform let god show who's who that's
[2:10:16] right and i said if i be falsely then
[2:10:17] gods will show it falsely that's right
[2:10:19] and god will always testify to the right
[2:10:22] i don't guess i tagged the next one but
[2:10:24] brother branham said something about
[2:10:27] uh how did well let me just read this i
[2:10:29] had a great victory a great wonderful
[2:10:31] service like it was in houston when the
[2:10:33] baptist preacher said that i was a demon
[2:10:36] and so forth remember the houston
[2:10:37] colosseum and and that's the only
[2:10:39] picture that came out and so forth you
[2:10:42] see what took place there when the angel
[2:10:43] of the lord come down now you know what
[2:10:46] happened we've never seen no more of
[2:10:48] them i guess he's still talking about
[2:10:49] them this is
