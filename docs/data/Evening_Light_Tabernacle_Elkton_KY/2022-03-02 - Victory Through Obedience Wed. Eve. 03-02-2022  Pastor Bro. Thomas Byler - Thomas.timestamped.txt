[28:09] that which we feel like you've laid upon
[28:11] our heart lord jesus and direct us
[28:13] lord jesus and the path that we should

[28:17] lord anoint us in the right direction in
[28:19] the ears of the years
[28:20] that they might hear what they need
[28:22] father supply their need lord jesus
[28:25] we just ask god that you'll bless each
[28:26] and every one both here
[28:28] and out there we just ask your blessing
[28:31] upon the reading in the word the
[28:32] meditation of our heart forgive us of
[28:34] any wrong anything that might not be
[28:35] done wrong or thought wrong father i
[28:37] want everything under the blood lord
[28:39] jesus so that we're ready to hear from
[28:41] you
[28:42] we just commit this service now into
[28:43] your hands for your honor and your glory
[28:46] in jesus name amen and amen
[28:50] amen
[28:52] so
[28:53] i want to speak amen on a subject
[28:56] amen that i have no doubt but spoke
[28:58] before and
[29:00] but
[29:00] i've uh
[29:01] mentioned that i think it last wednesday
[29:03] when we was at home
[29:05] amend us talk a little bit out of the
[29:07] book of deuteronomy amen as a matter of
[29:10] fact we almost just sat down and
[29:12] listened to the whole book of
[29:13] deuteronomy tonight
[29:15] amen i was just dating should i do that
[29:18] or what but anyway it would be a
[29:20] blessing amen
[29:22] you know the bible talked in the old
[29:23] testament that a certain time of the
[29:25] year the priests were together get
[29:27] together and they were supposed to read
[29:29] the whole scroll they were supposed to
[29:31] read
[29:32] the scrolls and so forth and that's what
[29:33] they would do amen
[29:35] so we would certainly be blessed to have
[29:36] that kind of a service sometimes where
[29:38] we just sit down and listen to the word
[29:39] when we
[29:40] because i'll tell you what i i certainly
[29:42] enjoy
[29:44] you know i don't can't always maybe just
[29:46] sit down but even if i'm working or
[29:48] whatever i will try to
[29:50] try to listen you know because you have
[29:52] the
[29:53] privilege now of even on your phone
[29:55] downloading your bible and
[29:57] and you can listen to the bible about
[29:59] any time amen so that that makes it real
[30:01] good amen
[30:03] and so it's busy as what we are nowadays
[30:05] and i'll tell you what
[30:07] the book of deuteronomy i just listened
[30:09] to it and
[30:10] and listen to it again and again amen i
[30:13] really
[30:14] it just i got inspiration from i guess
[30:16] and
[30:17] and
[30:18] one thing i noticed
[30:21] and that is that
[30:22] there is so many quotes out of the old
[30:25] testament not of that book
[30:26] that were brought over in the new
[30:28] testament that peter talked about the
[30:30] peculiar people and so forth god's
[30:31] chosen people and that paul talked about
[30:34] the hebrews and romans i guess i believe
[30:36] it was where it talks about the word is
[30:38] not in heaven or here there he says the
[30:39] word is naive even in thy mouth
[30:42] amen and that comes out of the book of
[30:43] deuteronomy and brought over into the
[30:45] new head a whole lot of things that are
[30:47] brought over
[30:48] amen and so we're just
[30:51] going to do the best we can with the
[30:53] help of the lord and we'll
[30:55] talk about the commandments of the lord
[30:58] and i titled this i believe it was
[31:00] uh you know uh
[31:02] let me see what i did here blessing and
[31:06] blessing prosperity and victory through
[31:09] obedience
[31:10] amen
[31:12] through obedience
[31:14] amen
[31:15] so basically that's what i want to talk
[31:16] about is obeying the commandments of the
[31:18] lord is that all right
[31:20] and what it does
[31:22] amen what it does
[31:24] to obey
[31:25] what god said
[31:27] do
[31:28] amen
[31:29] so praise the lord turn your bibles and
[31:31] i think we'll go and start i've got a
[31:32] lot of scriptures we could probably just
[31:34] read bible tonight you see all of those
[31:36] tabs right that's all scriptures we
[31:39] and so anyway let's go to luke let's
[31:42] start with luke something real simple
[31:44] here
[31:53] in luke the fourth chapter luke 4.
[32:06] and
[32:08] let's just read the first four verses
[32:10] and jesus being full of the holy ghost
[32:12] returned from jordan and was led
[32:15] by the spirit into the wilderness being
[32:17] 40 days
[32:20] tempted of the devil
[32:21] and in those days he did eat nothing and
[32:25] when they had
[32:26] ended they were entity afterwards
[32:28] hungered and the devil said unto him if
[32:30] thou be the son of god command these
[32:32] stones that it be made bread
[32:35] and jesus answereth hymns saying it is
[32:39] written that man shall not live by bread
[32:41] alone but by every word
[32:43] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[32:46] may god add his blessings to the reading
[32:48] of the word you can be seated
[32:50] so we see here brothers and sisters that
[32:52] we are to live not by bread alone but by
[32:55] every
[32:56] word
[32:57] that comes out of
[32:59] god's mouth
[33:02] amen praise the lord
[33:08] in john 15 as we begin to talk about
[33:11] god's commandments
[33:13] in john 15
[33:17] let's go to john 15 and verse
[33:22] 14. there's other scriptures that i
[33:24] could mention but i i've mentioned quite
[33:26] a few times before and i'm going to have
[33:28] enough that i mentioned i won't mention
[33:30] those but
[33:31] in john 14 20
[33:33] i'm sorry
[33:34] in john 15 14.
[33:38] it says ye are
[33:40] my friends
[33:42] if you do
[33:44] whatsoever
[33:45] i command you amen
[33:48] whatsoever i command you
[33:51] and you know as i go
[33:53] tonight i mean if i was to just lean on
[33:55] this and i probably will lean pretty
[33:56] heavy in this way
[33:58] uh it would look like i am teaching law
[34:02] and you know
[34:04] teaching law and salvation by law but
[34:06] salvation don't come by law
[34:09] amen this is for people who
[34:11] have been born again amen
[34:13] who serve the lord who have given gotten
[34:15] the free gift of the holy ghost because
[34:18] it's free right
[34:19] however once you are a christian there's
[34:21] things that god wants us to do right
[34:24] there's god thing there's things that he
[34:26] wants you to do and he wants you to do
[34:28] here he says if you are my friends and
[34:31] if you do whatsoever i command you over
[34:34] in chapter 14
[34:37] in verse 21 it says he that hath my
[34:40] commandments
[34:41] and keepeth them he it is that love with
[34:45] me
[34:46] amen here it is that loveth me and he
[34:49] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[34:51] father and i will love him and will
[34:53] manifest myself
[34:56] to him amen so there again jesus is
[34:58] saying that amen the one that obeys god
[35:01] the one that does what god says is the
[35:04] one that loves him
[35:07] this really has to do with being in a
[35:09] family the family of our heavenly father
[35:11] amen and dwelling under his blessings
[35:15] right to enter dwelling under his
[35:18] blessings and also under
[35:21] his chastisement
[35:23] right
[35:25] because how many believes that when you
[35:27] do wrong and when you sin
[35:30] there is uh you know people people they
[35:32] say well i do i don't get punished for
[35:34] that do i get punished if i repent well
[35:37] yeah you do
[35:39] because that's what jason means it means
[35:41] to correct
[35:43] right
[35:44] if there is no chastening there's no
[35:46] correction and god will correct you sure
[35:49] he'll forgive you if he didn't forgive
[35:51] you you'd be damned to hell
[35:53] but he's still going to teach you
[35:56] that's what our heavenly father does he
[35:58] tries to teach us
[35:59] amen and we all know that in a family
[36:02] when a father tells a child something
[36:04] now
[36:05] you know it might be a young lady might
[36:07] be a little boy or whatever and says
[36:09] look don't never talk to strangers right
[36:12] we teach them that for a reason don't we
[36:14] somebody
[36:15] approaches you and you aren't
[36:17] comfortable get away from them get back
[36:19] to mom and dad it's for their own good
[36:21] something that they'll learn as a matter
[36:22] of fact most of us can say that most of
[36:25] the discipline and the chastisement that
[36:27] we got from our parents
[36:29] if once you grow up and really see it
[36:32] the way that you should see it you will
[36:34] go back and thank mom and dad for that
[36:36] hard whooping that you just barely could
[36:38] stand at the time
[36:41] now right because you realize that it
[36:42] was actually something that was for your
[36:44] own good the bible says
[36:46] isn't that right
[36:48] it was for your own good it was going to
[36:50] help you when you get older
[36:53] it's going to make life a lot better for
[36:56] you
[36:57] if you get taught and if you get
[36:59] chastised
[37:00] it meant such well because i don't mean
[37:02] to go down this road but such disrespect
[37:04] such as telling people yes sir yeah and
[37:06] not to talk over people just all kinds
[37:08] of things you touch you know teach
[37:10] respect
[37:12] because you disrespect especially now
[37:14] age and that right disrespect could get
[37:17] you shot
[37:19] amen and so you know and so it just it
[37:21] it's a whole lot better to be respectful
[37:24] than disrespectful and everything and
[37:25] that's the way it is where heavenly
[37:27] father he don't just put a bunch of
[37:29] things on us to see if we can do it or
[37:30] whatever but it's for our good and it's
[37:33] for our blessing and as long as we do
[37:35] what our parents just tell us to do as
[37:37] long as we're under their roof we know
[37:39] that we are blessed we are taken care of
[37:41] we're watched out for and so forth but
[37:43] if you are rebellious and you don't do
[37:45] what you're supposed to do well that
[37:47] parent most likely isn't going to bless
[37:49] you when you end up in jail and you call
[37:52] mom and daddy to get you out of jail
[37:53] they just may tell you well maybe you
[37:55] ought to just sit there for a while
[38:00] ah because every time you do that and
[38:01] make it easy and support the tradition
[38:04] is going to do it again and be in the
[38:06] same place
[38:07] but anyway so amen and so that's kind of
[38:09] the focus of it is that as long as
[38:11] you're under god's obedience unless
[38:13] you're as long as you're an obedient
[38:15] child
[38:15] god's blessings are upon you
[38:19] amen
[38:20] now let me just say one thing over in
[38:22] peter
[38:24] over in peter first peter 2 9
[38:28] it says ye are a chosen generation a
[38:31] royal priesthood and holy nation
[38:34] a peculiar people that you should show
[38:37] forth the praises of him who have called
[38:40] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[38:42] light
[38:44] how many believe that we are a very
[38:45] blessed people
[38:48] i like that song i am blessed i am
[38:51] blessed
[38:52] this reminded me this uh
[38:54] sermon brother brad preached that's
[38:56] awful long ago about being blessed and
[38:58] because we are truly blessed
[39:00] amen and another look just to see how
[39:02] really blessed we are i begin to think
[39:04] and see that over
[39:06] in uh uh
[39:08] over in deuteronomy now i wanted to say
[39:10] that to say this over here if i could
[39:12] find it now
[39:15] amen over in deuteronomy
[39:17] if you want to go with me you can
[39:20] amen
[39:21] in deuteronomy
[39:23] the seventh chapter and
[39:27] verse 6 he says for thou art a holy
[39:30] people
[39:31] notice why it's the same wording as what
[39:34] people's peter said you're a holy people
[39:36] unto the lord your god the lord thy god
[39:39] has chosen to be thee to be a special
[39:42] people
[39:43] unto himself right
[39:46] above all people that are upon the face
[39:50] of the earth
[39:54] y'all hang on to your seats tonight
[39:56] but do you realize that you are
[40:00] more blessed you are the most blessed
[40:02] people
[40:03] on the face of the earth if god is your
[40:06] father
[40:08] if you know him to be your daddy if he's
[40:11] your heavenly father you are you are a
[40:13] blessed people above everybody out there
[40:21] doesn't that just do something
[40:22] wow not because of what you've done but
[40:25] because he chose you
[40:28] we are a chosen generation
[40:34] hallelujah we want to establish that
[40:36] first
[40:38] amen
[40:42] i think there was another one i ran
[40:44] across
[40:46] ran across over here
[40:50] in chapter 26 and verse 18 the lord
[40:54] hath vouched thee this day to be his
[40:59] peculiar people and that what peter said
[41:02] you're a peculiar people that's what
[41:04] israel was a peculiar people peter picks
[41:07] it up out of the old testament no doubt
[41:09] and realizes that not only were they but
[41:12] those that are born again they're a
[41:14] peculiar people a chosen nation
[41:18] amen as he hath promised thee that thou
[41:22] should escape all his commandments
[41:27] and to make the high above all nations
[41:29] which ye have made
[41:31] in praise and in name and in honor and
[41:34] that thou mayest be a holy people unto
[41:36] the lord thy god
[41:37] as he has
[41:39] spoken
[41:41] praise be to god it is amazing
[41:45] at how
[41:47] much of a resemblance there is between
[41:49] the believer the true believer now
[41:52] joshua and cable especially
[41:54] to the new testament saints amen
[41:59] if you'll notice over in deuteronomy the
[42:01] sixth chapter
[42:03] and when he gave begin to give out
[42:05] commandments one of them was in verse 16
[42:07] he shall not tempt the lord your god
[42:09] amen
[42:10] isn't that exactly what jesus repeated
[42:13] to the devil
[42:14] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god am
[42:17] i right
[42:18] so that was one of the things that was
[42:19] brought right over but you shall
[42:21] diligently keep the commandments of the
[42:23] lord your god his testimonies his
[42:26] statutes which he commanded thee this
[42:30] day
[42:31] well
[42:34] some folks may not think that you got to
[42:36] keep any commandments in the new
[42:37] testament the law's all done away with
[42:41] is that or is that right no
[42:44] no no no no
[42:47] peter says it this way i was looking for
[42:49] where paul was talking about
[42:51] uh
[42:52] that men acknowledged that the things we
[42:55] say is the commandments of the lord and
[42:56] this is what i came to and and there's a
[42:58] little something i spoke on sunday let
[43:00] you women keep silent this is in first
[43:02] corinthians 14 and verse 34. let your
[43:04] women keep silent in the churches for it
[43:07] is not permitted for them to speak
[43:10] but they are commandment to be under
[43:12] obedience as also saith the law
[43:15] and if they will learn anything let them
[43:17] ask their husbands at home for it is a
[43:19] shame for a woman
[43:21] to speak in the church what came the
[43:23] word of god out from you or did he come
[43:26] up from you only in other words he was
[43:28] trying to say that you're not the only
[43:29] one who gets the word of the lord notice
[43:31] the very next scripture how binding this
[43:34] is right after he says that if any man
[43:37] think that he's a
[43:38] preacher or should this says prophet
[43:42] or spiritual spiritual then let him
[43:45] acknowledge that the things that i write
[43:48] unto you are
[43:52] the commandments of the lord
[43:55] amen
[43:56] somebody knows this the whole new
[43:58] testament everything paul wrote
[44:01] are the commandments of the lord how
[44:03] many believe it
[44:05] that's right because why paul
[44:08] was a messenger that god used to write
[44:11] almost the whole new testament
[44:13] he said all scripture is given by
[44:15] inspiration of god and his profitable
[44:17] doctrine for reproof for instruction in
[44:19] righteousness
[44:20] amen and so forth
[44:23] all right so back to deuteronomy let's
[44:26] go back to deuteronomy again
[44:29] and pick up where we talked about that
[44:31] he said that he has chosen thee
[44:34] to be a special people unto himself i
[44:37] like that i mean he was truly god that
[44:40] chose us because he knew what was in us
[44:43] before the foundation of the world he
[44:46] knew what you would have on the inside
[44:48] of your heart he knew what you would be
[44:52] amen
[44:53] he chose abraham how he believes he
[44:54] chose abraham
[44:58] and abraham i want to use for an example
[45:00] here for just a little bit but maybe
[45:01] before we go on let me just read
[45:03] something that brother bam said about
[45:05] abraham now we find out the new
[45:07] testament says that abraham staggered
[45:09] not at the promise of god was strong
[45:11] through faith amen isn't that right
[45:14] now we know that abraham he wasn't so
[45:17] perfect
[45:20] now paul under the blood when he wrote
[45:23] it when he was inspired he didn't see
[45:25] none of that none of that came out
[45:28] right he said he's saying or not the old
[45:30] testament you can see all kinds of
[45:32] staggers
[45:33] and that his wife talked him into maybe
[45:35] this son supposed to be born through
[45:37] hagar take ar to yourself
[45:40] and that made a real mess of the whole
[45:42] world for
[45:43] forever and her ceiling deal with
[45:45] huh sure
[45:47] and there and he lied and he you know he
[45:50] he brought his dad out he brought his
[45:52] nephew lot out and got it said separate
[45:55] yourself from all you kindred
[45:58] listen to what he said
[46:01] oh my remember
[46:03] another thing he told him to do was to
[46:05] separate from as a kindred and all of
[46:07] his people
[46:08] he says god in
[46:10] order to get a man or a woman boy or
[46:12] girl to obey him you have to separate
[46:15] yourself from all unbelief
[46:19] amen
[46:20] i want to say that's what we're
[46:22] preaching about tonight is
[46:23] trying to separate ourselves from all
[46:26] this belief
[46:28] and disobedience
[46:31] amen
[46:33] if you don't get nothing else from
[46:35] tonight's service remember this if you
[46:36] want to get closer to god
[46:38] see what else
[46:40] you're failing to obey and start obeying
[46:43] it
[46:45] huh
[46:47] that's what you do
[46:48] because remember back to what jesus said
[46:51] man is not to live by bread alone but by
[46:53] every word
[46:55] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[46:57] everything he says if you love me
[46:59] do if you might call my friends then do
[47:01] whatsoever things i command you amen
[47:07] praise the lord
[47:13] now
[47:15] a total separation from all unbelief
[47:17] remember abraham the patriarch was never
[47:20] absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed
[47:24] exactly what god said do and we will
[47:28] never never never receive a blessing
[47:31] have the blessings
[47:33] until we obey what god said do
[47:40] how many believe that
[47:42] you want to be blessed more
[47:45] you'll never give receive the full
[47:47] blessings of god until it's complete and
[47:49] full
[47:50] obedience and like i said sunday it's a
[47:53] searching of our heart examine yourself
[47:56] i mean as we've got to examine ourselves
[48:01] see where you're at with god
[48:04] dig a little deeper and then right got
[48:07] to dig a little deeper you want more of
[48:08] god you've got to make more room for god
[48:12] amen
[48:15] all right
[48:18] the lord god did not set his love upon
[48:20] you this is in deuteronomy 7 again if
[48:22] anybody wants to follow deuteronomy 7
[48:24] and 7
[48:26] the lord did not set his love upon you
[48:28] nor choose you because you were more in
[48:30] number than any people for ye were the
[48:33] fewest of all people but because the
[48:35] lord loved you and because
[48:37] he would keep the oath which he had
[48:39] sworn unto your fathers
[48:41] hath the lord brought you out with a
[48:43] mighty hand and redeemed you out of the
[48:45] house of the bondage
[48:46] from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
[48:49] like we could all testify that we were
[48:51] once in sin and god brought us out in
[48:54] that right
[48:55] look at what god did for you
[48:58] because why because he loved you
[49:01] amen
[49:04] now let's go down to verse 11 thou shalt
[49:07] therefore
[49:09] keep the commandments
[49:11] and statutes and judgment which i
[49:13] command thee this day to do them
[49:16] wherefore
[49:17] it shall come to pass
[49:19] now notice
[49:21] what i said about obedience what comes
[49:24] through obedience
[49:25] that if ye hearken to these judgments
[49:28] and keep and do them
[49:30] the lord thy god shall keep thee unto
[49:33] thee
[49:34] the covenant and the mercy which he
[49:36] swear unto the fathers he will love thee
[49:39] and bless thee and multiply thee
[49:44] he will also bless the fruit of thy womb
[49:47] the fruit of thy land my corn and thy
[49:50] wine and thy oil
[49:52] the increase of thy kind
[49:54] the flocks of thy sheep
[49:56] in the land which he swear unto thy
[49:59] fathers to give thee
[50:01] now here's the phrase i underline thou
[50:03] shalt be blessed above all people
[50:12] let me just stop and say this
[50:16] that i know that god blesses you
[50:18] financially he blesses you in your
[50:20] natural he promised to do that
[50:23] he promised that you would be taken care
[50:25] of that you would prosper
[50:27] you know jesus is called the son of
[50:29] prosperity
[50:31] everything he does prospers and when
[50:33] he's in you
[50:34] it doesn't matter if you're in jail
[50:37] you're singing songs like paul did he
[50:39] still prospered the angels came and
[50:41] brushed the gates down opened them up
[50:44] even no matter what
[50:46] he prospered
[50:48] and thou shalt be blessed above all
[50:50] people
[50:52] and thou shalt not uh there shall not be
[50:54] a male or female barren among you
[50:56] or among your cattle and the lord will
[50:58] take away from the all sickness and put
[51:00] none of these evil diseases of egypt
[51:02] which thou knowest upon thee but will
[51:04] lay them upon all them that hate thee
[51:07] amen
[51:09] amen somebody knows it's better not to
[51:12] touch one of god's little ones for it's
[51:14] better than a mule song were hanged
[51:16] about his neck
[51:18] somebody tries to trip you up somebody
[51:20] don't just give it to god watch out god
[51:22] will take care of it
[51:24] my place says god will prepay them to
[51:27] their face
[51:28] how many members one place god said
[51:30] don't take vengeance upon yourselves he
[51:32] says i
[51:33] vengeance is mine saith the lord i will
[51:37] repay
[51:40] so if you're obeying god command
[51:42] following his commandments don't worry
[51:43] about your enemies god will take care of
[51:46] your enemies one place in deuteronomy i
[51:48] don't think i'll come across my yet
[51:50] i might yet
[51:52] but he says your enemy will come in at
[51:54] you from one direction and they will
[51:56] flee in seven direction
[52:00] don't you get too happy now
[52:05] but we find out that whenever israel
[52:06] would backslide whenever they would get
[52:08] away from god the bible says that they
[52:10] would let uh i forget not what it was
[52:12] but there would be groups bands of
[52:14] people that would come in and you know
[52:15] and take them and make sleeves out of
[52:18] them and to take their stuff
[52:19] started to happen
[52:20] [Music]
[52:22] amen
[52:24] how many knows that when you disobey one
[52:26] of god's commandments you automatically
[52:29] the devil comes and steals your joy
[52:32] all of a sudden you're all
[52:34] you know
[52:36] you get robbed
[52:38] amen
[52:40] okay
[52:42] thou shalt be blessed above
[52:44] all people
[52:46] now
[52:49] i want to go
[52:52] just over here but
[52:54] let's go to 7
[52:56] chapter 6 and verse
[53:00] after he said you shall not tempt the
[53:02] lord thy god
[53:03] you shall ye ye shall diligently keep
[53:07] the commandments of the lord your god
[53:09] his testimonies his statutes
[53:12] which he had commanded i'ma bring this
[53:13] down micah which he hath commanded that
[53:16] thou sh
[53:17] and thou shalt do that which is right
[53:20] and good in the sight of the lord
[53:23] that it may be well with thee and that
[53:25] thou mayest go in and possess the good
[53:28] land which the lord swear unto thy
[53:31] fathers
[53:32] to cast out all thine enemies from
[53:34] before thee as the lord has spoken
[53:38] i want to tell you i truly believe that
[53:39] when you obey god god gets rid of all of
[53:43] those enemies that want to torment you
[53:47] all the enemies whatever it might be god
[53:49] will drive them out
[53:52] because you sure can't now can you
[53:55] no god will have to do it all you got to
[53:57] do is follow christ
[53:59] amen
[54:02] thank god i thank the lord for his grace
[54:05] you're a holy people you're a peculiar
[54:09] people
[54:10] amen
[54:15] over in deuteronomy
[54:18] 26 again i want to pick that back up and
[54:20] read almost the whole chapter okay
[54:24] i'll read down to verse 13
[54:26] and then i want to jump over to 28
[54:30] because i'll tell you what i really like
[54:33] that from 15
[54:35] to 18 that is a great
[54:37] congregational reading right there
[54:39] amen where he talks about cursed be he
[54:41] that removeth his neighbor's landmark
[54:43] and all the people said
[54:46] amen almost the whole chapter god was
[54:48] teaching us to say
[54:50] amen all right now let me see here
[55:01] 28 i believe it is
[55:05] that is not
[55:08] yep chapter 28 let's start here
[55:11] and it shall come to pass if thou
[55:14] shalt hearken diligently i like that
[55:16] notice this is what happens when you
[55:19] truly
[55:21] hearken diligently unto the voice of the
[55:24] lord thy god to observe and to do all
[55:28] his commandments which i command thee
[55:30] this day
[55:31] that the lord thy god will set thee on
[55:33] high above all the nations of the earth
[55:37] amen
[55:38] now i want to say something before i go
[55:40] on here because i don't want to give
[55:41] people the wrong impression
[55:44] matthew 5 jesus says blessed
[55:47] are the meek for the shall inherit
[55:49] blessed are the peacemakers blessed
[55:51] blessed blessed blessed bless it and
[55:53] with some of these things here
[55:55] i'm not here to decide look this is what
[55:57] was carried over this isn't
[55:59] you know all of these is exactly
[56:01] something you'll have will happen to you
[56:03] i i'm not here to say that
[56:04] but what i'm trying to give you an
[56:06] example of is this is the way that god
[56:08] blessed them back then and this is the
[56:10] you know because it talks about your cat
[56:12] well i got no cattle on flocks and sheep
[56:14] you know but what basically from what
[56:17] i'm reading here the overall is god's
[56:19] going to be with you no matter what amen
[56:22] but i know in the other in the old in
[56:23] the new testament you know we weren't
[56:26] flop we aren't promised a flowery bed of
[56:29] ease look at the christians down through
[56:31] the dark they did not have it easy but
[56:33] they they prospered and they blossomed
[56:36] no matter what come their way
[56:38] even in giving your life and having your
[56:40] head chopped up there is prosperity in
[56:42] it
[56:43] why
[56:44] because you know what's on the other
[56:46] side that you have eternal life
[56:48] okay so just as a teacher i want to try
[56:51] to make sure that nobody gets confused
[56:53] and they shall come to pass if thou
[56:54] shall hear and diligently unto the voice
[56:56] of the lord thy god to observe and to do
[56:58] all his commandments which i command
[57:00] thee this day the lord thy god will set
[57:02] thee high above all nations of the earth
[57:05] and all these blessings shall come upon
[57:08] thee and overtake thee
[57:10] if thou shalt hearken unto the voice
[57:13] notice how many times he says this is
[57:15] what's going to happen if
[57:17] you obey
[57:20] now how many knows that's exactly true
[57:22] in a new testament you cannot expect to
[57:25] not obey
[57:26] and be blessed
[57:28] i should get a resounding amen
[57:30] because the prophet of god said abraham
[57:32] was never fully blessed until he fully
[57:34] obeyed neither will a believer a boy or
[57:35] girl neither will we until we come to
[57:38] that place
[57:40] amen
[57:41] but i like it because it's gonna it's
[57:43] gonna come and it's just gonna overtake
[57:46] you i like when i like that kind of word
[57:47] it's not something you're gonna have to
[57:49] struggle for not to fight for
[57:52] god's gonna just come to come and he's
[57:53] going to overtake you maybe that reminds
[57:55] me of somebody coming up behind you just
[57:57] grab you and you're knocking it down
[57:59] god opening in the windows of the
[58:00] blessed open the windows of heaven and
[58:02] pouring out your blessing amen that'll
[58:05] probably almost knock you off your feet
[58:10] blessed shall thou be in the city and
[58:12] bless it shall thou be in the field amen
[58:15] blessed shall be the fruit of thy body
[58:17] and the fruit of thy ground and the
[58:19] fruit of the cattle the increase of thy
[58:21] kind the flocks of thy sheep
[58:24] bless it shall be thy basket in my store
[58:26] blessed shalt thou be when i come to sin
[58:28] and bless it shall be thou when that
[58:30] goes out amen
[58:34] how many fields that way this morning
[58:36] you know i am blessed i am blessed i am
[58:39] every day that i live when i wake up in
[58:41] the morning when i lay my head to rest i
[58:43] am blessed
[58:45] how many is blessed tonight
[58:48] when you set your heart to the lord
[58:53] you're blessed
[58:55] because remember this one thing you're
[58:57] either gonna people either live in the
[58:58] blessings of god
[59:00] or in the damnation of god
[59:02] or the curse of god
[59:05] am i right
[59:10] and thou shalt the lord shall cause on
[59:12] enemies to rise there it is rise up
[59:14] against thee
[59:16] to be smitten before that face
[59:18] and they shall come out against thee one
[59:20] way and flee before the
[59:23] seven ways
[59:25] i like that
[59:27] the lord shall command the blessing
[59:30] upon thee in thy store houses and in all
[59:33] that thou said is the hand unto
[59:36] and he shall bless thee in the land
[59:37] which the lord thy god giveth thee
[59:39] israel had a what we might call a
[59:42] absolute promise of natural blessings
[59:46] didn't they
[59:47] they had a promise of natural blessings
[59:51] we have a promise of natural blessings
[59:54] but mostly i say spiritual blessings
[59:57] jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of
[59:59] god and his righteousness and
[1:00:02] all the things
[1:00:05] shall be added unto you in other words
[1:00:07] god is going to take care of you
[1:00:09] food clothing
[1:00:12] when i was thinking about this i was
[1:00:14] laying there
[1:00:16] and i was thinking lord everything i
[1:00:19] have i have because of your blessings
[1:00:23] because of you the house that i dwell in
[1:00:26] it's because of your blessing
[1:00:28] a little farm that it's because of god's
[1:00:31] it's not something i did it was simply
[1:00:34] god's blessing
[1:00:38] amen i don't know about you but
[1:00:41] sometimes i don't i feel like i don't
[1:00:43] obey the lord as much as i should
[1:00:45] you know some of them little things they
[1:00:47] just are natural fleshless likes to you
[1:00:49] know go a little too fast or do this
[1:00:51] that or the other and
[1:00:54] lord pricks us am i right
[1:00:56] but yet
[1:00:58] god blesses you and you'll look at the
[1:00:59] old testament as much as a man would
[1:01:01] serve god god would bless the man
[1:01:04] and however much he would not serve him
[1:01:06] he would not bless him
[1:01:08] amen that's why i believed in full i
[1:01:11] don't know about you without like the
[1:01:12] full blessings of god
[1:01:14] the car you drive the money you have the
[1:01:16] breath that i have the help that i have
[1:01:19] 60 years old i'm you know i'm thankful
[1:01:23] a lot of folks don't make it to 60 thank
[1:01:24] you lord for letting me make it to 60.
[1:01:28] amen everything is god's blessings can i
[1:01:31] go on
[1:01:34] he commanded
[1:01:36] a blessing upon that storehouse
[1:01:38] and let me just stop
[1:01:40] when i think about
[1:01:42] when i think about tommy
[1:01:44] if i just kept serving the devil if i
[1:01:47] just stayed out there
[1:01:48] where would i be
[1:01:52] brother david says he'd be six foot
[1:01:54] under tommy you know how many times
[1:01:55] would we almost go down right
[1:01:58] so many times
[1:02:00] i thought about brother time back then i
[1:02:01] said you know look at the life that he
[1:02:02] had
[1:02:04] how little he had
[1:02:05] how uh how he ended in jail
[1:02:09] that was the culmination of the great
[1:02:11] serving
[1:02:12] of the devil as you end up in jail your
[1:02:14] wife fixing to leave you and you ain't
[1:02:16] got nothing and you know what you're
[1:02:17] gonna do that's the culmination of the
[1:02:19] blessings of the devil
[1:02:21] huh
[1:02:24] but now look at brother tommy look look
[1:02:26] at what god's blessing with
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:30] praise god right
[1:02:32] why because he gave his heart to the
[1:02:33] lord because he began to serve god and
[1:02:35] the more you do
[1:02:37] the more god blesses you
[1:02:40] he does and i know i know you know you i
[1:02:44] don't mean to preach a message of
[1:02:45] prosperity against somebody's feelings
[1:02:47] but the fact is when you serve god
[1:02:49] you're promised to prosper
[1:02:54] you will prosper i don't care if you're
[1:02:57] as broke as
[1:02:58] paul was
[1:02:59] paul still prospered
[1:03:01] every time they tried to kill him they
[1:03:03] didn't get it done
[1:03:04] isn't that right
[1:03:06] not until god was finished with him he
[1:03:08] prospered in everything that he does
[1:03:13] well brother bob i sure wish you had a
[1:03:15] scripture for it
[1:03:20] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:03:22] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[1:03:24] in this way of the sinners nor sitteth
[1:03:26] in the seat and scornful praise be to
[1:03:28] god he's not an unbeliever
[1:03:30] right
[1:03:32] but his delight is in the law of the
[1:03:35] lord and in his law does he meditate day
[1:03:39] and night
[1:03:41] after this wednesday night i hope every
[1:03:42] one of us meditate am i keeping all
[1:03:44] these commandments
[1:03:46] am i doing everything god said to do
[1:03:52] am i meditating on his law
[1:03:54] on what he asked us to do day and night
[1:03:57] because jesus said
[1:03:58] am i right if you do whatever i command
[1:04:01] you
[1:04:03] and in his law does he meditate day and
[1:04:06] night and he shall be like a tree
[1:04:08] planted by the rivers of water
[1:04:11] that bringeth forth his fruit and his
[1:04:13] season his leaf also shall not wither
[1:04:15] and
[1:04:17] whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:04:20] prosper
[1:04:26] don't get so loud
[1:04:29] whatever he does shall prosper
[1:04:39] how about david
[1:04:41] he loved the lord
[1:04:43] you know the lord is my shepherd i shall
[1:04:45] not want he knew all about what it was
[1:04:47] like to serve god god loved him he slew
[1:04:51] goliath he slew lions and bears until
[1:04:55] he broke god's law and coveted his
[1:04:57] neighbor's wife
[1:05:00] then all hades so to speak come down on
[1:05:02] him
[1:05:05] people were making love with his wives
[1:05:07] up on the roof in front of the public
[1:05:10] all kinds of terrible things that god
[1:05:12] did to david
[1:05:14] absalon taking the throne and
[1:05:16] overthrowing it and dying itself and it
[1:05:18] was really bad
[1:05:21] because god already promised
[1:05:23] if you don't do what i ask you this is
[1:05:25] what's going to happen
[1:05:26] all these things are going to happen
[1:05:29] i wish i had the scripts if he talks
[1:05:31] about a deity woman that wouldn't even
[1:05:32] let her feet go on the grass or whatever
[1:05:35] a dainty woman that will never be
[1:05:36] unfaithful to her husband will eat her
[1:05:38] children
[1:05:42] because they don't commit
[1:05:44] obey the commandments of lord read deed
[1:05:46] around me
[1:05:48] become terrible
[1:05:52] how about
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:55] samson
[1:05:56] killing a thousand philistines right he
[1:05:59] was a hero nobody can stop him
[1:06:02] unstoppable
[1:06:04] until he disobeyed
[1:06:06] and he cut his hair
[1:06:09] for the rest of his life it was a
[1:06:10] miserable boy
[1:06:12] how many believes out of the way of a
[1:06:14] transgressor
[1:06:15] is hard
[1:06:20] amen i trust each and every one of us
[1:06:24] with the help of the lord both here and
[1:06:26] out there
[1:06:27] know that when you don't listen to that
[1:06:29] still small voice that tells you the
[1:06:31] scripture tells you what's right and you
[1:06:34] go against that how many know you pay
[1:06:36] for it
[1:06:38] sure you do
[1:06:39] you get miserable
[1:06:42] you don't have no joy anymore
[1:06:45] it just goes bad
[1:06:48] god's not going to bless you for doing
[1:06:50] bad he's going to punish you for doing
[1:06:52] bad sure he'll forgive you
[1:06:54] but he still has your child he's going
[1:06:56] to teach you
[1:06:58] how many beliefs we need to learn
[1:07:02] that's right
[1:07:04] abraham another example
[1:07:11] abraham he didn't obey
[1:07:14] he took his father and brother bam says
[1:07:15] that he went out there and god promised
[1:07:17] him all he thinks but he took his lot
[1:07:19] and all of them and not until he
[1:07:20] separated himself from lot not until
[1:07:23] they had that spat
[1:07:25] huh
[1:07:27] his own kindred had his spat
[1:07:30] and he lot went one way abraham went the
[1:07:32] other way and then god appeared to him
[1:07:34] the bible says
[1:07:36] amen and spoke to him and gave him the
[1:07:38] promise of a promised son and so forth
[1:07:41] how about saul
[1:07:42] i know that saul
[1:07:46] he wasn't very careful about obeying
[1:07:48] what god said do
[1:07:50] y'all remember what saul did
[1:07:54] he brought the king back brought all the
[1:07:55] sheep and the goats back and sacked the
[1:07:57] sacrifice to god when god said i want
[1:08:00] you to destroy all the animals and
[1:08:01] everybody man woman and child kill them
[1:08:03] all
[1:08:06] and when samuel came to him
[1:08:08] saul goes up the samuel says samuel i
[1:08:10] have obeyed the commandments of the lord
[1:08:14] samuel said then why am i here in a
[1:08:17] bunch of bleeding sheep
[1:08:20] huh
[1:08:21] i'm not supposed to be hearing no sheep
[1:08:24] and i don't know if it's go uh
[1:08:26] what the name of the king was anymore
[1:08:31] but anyway found that wrong samuel
[1:08:33] brought the king out and chopped him to
[1:08:35] pieces
[1:08:37] isn't that right he said this is how you
[1:08:39] obey god chop the guy all the pieces
[1:08:41] that's what god said
[1:08:44] i was listening to that as i was working
[1:08:45] a little bit this morning and how that
[1:08:48] how that uh israel one day when joshua
[1:08:51] and all those joshua cross to draw over
[1:08:53] on dry land and all those people heard
[1:08:55] about it they all consolidated and he
[1:08:57] says they were like the sand of the sea
[1:09:01] like the sand of the sea the guys came
[1:09:04] to fight against joshua and so forth
[1:09:06] they were all destroyed
[1:09:08] and the bible says that god hardened
[1:09:10] them guys hearts
[1:09:13] to come and fight against them
[1:09:15] to bring judgment upon them for what
[1:09:17] they had done already
[1:09:19] i thought wow
[1:09:21] they knew they couldn't win because they
[1:09:23] already heard all the terrible stories
[1:09:25] of this god that is with them but they
[1:09:27] still hardened our day they went it says
[1:09:29] they went to their neighbors and
[1:09:30] everybody got together and we said well
[1:09:32] they're coming we better go find them
[1:09:36] the only smart guys you know who the
[1:09:38] smart guys were
[1:09:40] there was a couple of them that uh
[1:09:43] me and i got to remember i don't know if
[1:09:45] this
[1:09:46] what their names were anymore but you'll
[1:09:47] remember the story how that there was
[1:09:49] some of the leaders of a nation that was
[1:09:52] close by that put on old clothes
[1:09:55] old wine bottles and so forth and
[1:09:58] looking all haggard and stuff and they
[1:10:00] came up to joshua
[1:10:03] and uh and came to him and says we come
[1:10:05] from the far land you know we want to
[1:10:07] make peace and we want to have arm you
[1:10:10] know and so forth and they lied like the
[1:10:12] devil
[1:10:13] they were not from far
[1:10:17] and joshua
[1:10:19] and them made them and the elders made a
[1:10:21] league with that they were smart because
[1:10:23] they knew that was the best thing to do
[1:10:26] it's trying to go make peace with these
[1:10:28] guys
[1:10:32] but anyway
[1:10:33] joshua and the elders made a league with
[1:10:36] him
[1:10:36] he consulted with the elders but one
[1:10:38] thing that the word said it says but he
[1:10:41] didn't consult the lord
[1:10:46] he should have consulted the lord about
[1:10:49] it not just the elders
[1:10:51] maybe he wouldn't have been trapped
[1:10:52] because when they found out that they
[1:10:54] were from a very close nation and so
[1:10:57] forth all of israel wanted them they
[1:10:59] wanted to kill them but the elder says
[1:11:01] no we don't gave them our word we can't
[1:11:04] and they became
[1:11:06] slaves basically to him
[1:11:09] amen
[1:11:11] but i just thought it was something how
[1:11:12] that
[1:11:14] folks i'm here to tell you i'm going to
[1:11:16] just put it in plain words here
[1:11:18] that if you obey god and do what god
[1:11:20] said do
[1:11:21] god will take care of your enemies
[1:11:25] those things that your enemy whether
[1:11:28] it's
[1:11:29] whatever it might be lust of the flesh
[1:11:31] hello whatever it might be if you obey
[1:11:33] god the way that all of that will go by
[1:11:35] the wayside
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:37] god will take care of that enemy
[1:11:40] that's what i believe that this
[1:11:41] scripture says i will drive out your
[1:11:43] enemies from before you if you hearken
[1:11:46] diligently unto the voice of the lord
[1:11:50] folks we would have a lot less problems
[1:11:53] people would have a lot less problems if
[1:11:56] they just obey god
[1:11:58] when i got to thinking about this and
[1:12:00] and what obeying god and what serving
[1:12:03] god does and the enemies that it keeps
[1:12:05] you from
[1:12:06] i had to think of the tattoos the
[1:12:08] earrings and all the things that people
[1:12:10] will do to themselves because
[1:12:13] they're completely lost
[1:12:16] their minds are not the way it's
[1:12:17] supposed to be and then we know that
[1:12:18] somebody that ain't filled with the holy
[1:12:20] ghost their mind isn't right i think
[1:12:21] well that's the enemies that would have
[1:12:23] come upon me that's what would be upon
[1:12:25] you
[1:12:27] oh thank god for his grace
[1:12:30] aren't you glad for that
[1:12:32] but saul was not
[1:12:34] so careful about obeying god isn't that
[1:12:36] right
[1:12:38] and god didn't like it too well
[1:12:40] he did not like it too well and whenever
[1:12:43] uh saul was still king and they were
[1:12:46] fighting the philistines as you know and
[1:12:47] they were all
[1:12:48] uh

[1:13:51] i don't know that i made it so far but i
[1:13:52] want to read this
[1:13:54] this is in deuteronomy 6 again
[1:13:59] and we'll go down to
[1:14:04] verse two that thou mightest fear the
[1:14:07] lord thy god and keep all these statues
[1:14:09] and his commandments which i command ye
[1:14:11] this commandee
[1:14:13] thou and thy son
[1:14:15] and thy son's son
[1:14:18] all the days of thy life

[1:14:23] that the days may be
[1:14:26] prolonged

[1:15:13] thee in the land that floweth with milk
[1:15:15] and honey hero israel the lord our god
[1:15:18] is one lord

[1:15:41] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:15:43] unto thy children and thou shalt talk to
[1:15:46] the uh of them when thou sittest in thy
[1:15:49] house
[1:15:50] and when that isn't that something god

[1:15:56] quick way of forgetting these things he
[1:15:58] says i he's got to he got to tell us

[1:16:23] when thou rises up and that's oh my
[1:16:27] because you stopped that you quit doing
[1:16:29] a lot of these things and that's why our
[1:16:31] pews are so empty
[1:16:34] because people just
[1:16:36] drift away from god
[1:16:39] thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[1:16:42] thine hand and they shall be as
[1:16:44] frontlets between thine eyes and thou
[1:16:46] shall write them upon the posts of thy

[1:19:55] brother braham said of pot of first wife
[1:19:56] he said she was a beautiful woman
[1:19:58] honorable the highest woman in the
[1:20:00] country begged him and persuaded him
[1:20:03] and she caught him and tried to hug up
[1:20:05] to him and so forth yet he jerked
[1:20:08] till he even pulled his coat off and run
[1:20:10] from her
[1:20:11] that's how much joseph
[1:20:13] obeyed the lord
[1:20:16] hello
[1:20:17] yes sir and when he come in they told a
[1:20:20] lie on him
[1:20:22] said he come in to ravage her and left
[1:20:24] his coat there
[1:20:25] and from there he went to the dungeon
[1:20:27] but in the dungeon god was with him no
[1:20:29] matter where they put him he was always
[1:20:32] a type of the son of prosperity
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:39] i mean
[1:20:40] joseph was the son of

[1:20:43] but
[1:20:44] many are the afflictions of the
[1:20:46] righteous but
[1:20:52] that's right but the lord delivered them
[1:20:54] out of them all
[1:20:57] because if joseph at first he wanted to
[1:20:59] kill joseph and one of his brothers got
[1:21:02] in their heart no don't kill him just
[1:21:03] throw him in a pit and that right
[1:21:05] and from there they sold him off
[1:21:08] from there he became you know
[1:21:11] a a servant
[1:21:13] in a i guess a prison keeper's house
[1:21:16] right
[1:21:17] and so forth and from there things went
[1:21:19] from bad to worse
[1:21:21] right
[1:21:22] bad to worse but yet he was a sign of
[1:21:24] prosperity
[1:21:25] even there he was blessed and he rose to
[1:21:28] the very
[1:21:30] right hand of pharaoh
[1:21:32] everything joseph done prospered and
[1:21:34] when jesus returns in the millennium
[1:21:37] that's the reason that the deserts will
[1:21:38] blossom as it rose everything does
[1:21:41] will prosper he is
[1:21:44] the son of prosperity
[1:21:46] amen
