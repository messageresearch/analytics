charts amen so praise the lord it's very good amen seems just a little warm in here so we're going to go ahead and get the old coat off amen I don't know what in the world but I guess it's what they come up with that you're supposed to we right so anyway amen let's just bow our heads precious and kind heavenly father as we come before you Lord once again Lord Jesus and in this second service Lord Jesus in honor respect to you father and we just ask God that you'd come in a special way Lord and bless your people for their efforts Lord Jesus and even though we're a little tired tied Lord would think that it's certainly worth it Lord Jesus just to be able to hear your word some more and strengthen ourselves and feed ourselves from the spiritual food that you've provided in due season God that we would have strength and energy and the vitamins that we need to sustain to sustain us and to give us spiritual health Lord and so tonight we just ask God that you'll bless the meditation of our heart Lord and that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak tonight Just Have Your Way father we just want to remember each in every request that's already been mentioned father just be with each one Lord and meet those needs father today God be with us now as we open your Bible we ask for your anointing and your spirit in a special way in Jesus name amen and amen we want to with the help of the Lord for just a few minutes tonight and amen go on maybe on like the other a little bit at the other direction of uh the other half should we say of uh amen going back to the original and amen and talking about hybrid Li hybrid religion and we want to De a little bit more with the hybrid side for a little while if we could would that be okay amen and we'll read uh 1 Corinthians if you will 1 Corinthians 1 Corinthians and verse chapter 4 I'm sorry it's not 1 Corinthians it's second Corinthians 2 Corinthians 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 6 for God who commanded the light out to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in our Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal body may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen this morning we understand that brother Brandon when he was preaching on hybrid religion he talked about how that uh the age that we're living in that it actually uh you know the food that you eat amen affects your body am mean I think anybody here knows that your diet amen is a major part amen of your health amen I think brother Tommy I think I've seen it somewhere about what is it what is it uh 20% exercise 80% diet or something like that somewhere in there so and that's about what it is isn't it is it the diet that we have daily that affects us and the the hybrid corn the H I read where brother's talking about the Corn Flakes and everything else that we eat amen and it how it affects us amen but you know I want to start out with saying this that you know when I was talking about original I want to touch on that for just a little bit if I could a little bit because we look at we look at a lot of original as far as in God's program and in God's plan and the things that God said when he said let there be let every SE bring forth of its kind and so forth and he put all of those things in their places now you can you can go right outside this back door here and just go about 15 20 yards right up there ain't that right and uh in the fall of the year when these acorns drop isn't that right and you know you can go and plant those again and they'll produce other trees amen and so every seed brings forth of its kind all of nature it's in its original condition not not not that it you know I know it has death in it but it's still in the place that God has put it amen just like the animal kingdom all of the all of those they do exactly what God put the Instinct in the nature in them to do amen and in that it's all awesome and unique amen uh all in the in the universe in the galaxies the Sun the moon and all of out there the Stars they all hold their place they stay where their God had put them and we know that the things that uh how was it uh uh we know that the world that now is Peter I believe said is kept by the word of God in other words things stay in their orbits and stay in the place that they're supposed to be because the word of God ain't that right they're submissive to the word of God now and I want to just bring it down to the church how many believes that if the church you and I the people of God the Church of God when we're submissive to the word of God Amen and then we operate and we uh conduct ourselves and do exactly and the way that he originally planned for us to do is that right amen just like forgiving another of our debts and sins and trespasses If any man had all against any even as Christ forgave you forgive the forgiveness is there is that right and as long as we're in that context and so forth we're in that original state and things certainly work the way that it's supposed to work Ain that right how many likes when things go the way that you're supposed to go amen now we would have a serious problem if if on the back row or anywhere here we knew that there was two men sitting to together married right we have we'd have issue with that or two women huh things would be out of cater you know and and look at the world look at where the world is in that outside of the church outside of and you rub neighbors with it and every every day and look at where they're at and the chaos that they're in the turmoil that they're in amen so praise God for being in the place that God wants us to be amen and so let's let's just pick up a couple things here maybe before I go and read these these quotes that I really want to lay a foundation for but we want to look at I this is where I didn't get to this morning but we want to take a couple examples with the help of the Lord amen of how that God calls us to a certain place amen he ordains us gives us so to speak an original position that he wants you to be in just like uh uh you know even Satan in heaven isn't that right and the angels the Bible says in Judah I believe the Angels which kept not their first estate in other words they they they didn't stay in the original position that God wanted them to be in amen how many believes that it's very very important for every man to be in the position and hold the position of headship in the home and is that right it's very important that a woman stays in her place cuz anytime you get any of that out of cater you know and uh you know that's why you've got what you got out there brother brah talked about a woman out there on the street a policeman no business being out there doing all of that ain't that right but everything when as long as that's in that state that it's supposed to be in amen then God is behind it God blesses it amen we can have husbands wives we can have families we can have children we can raise our children amen and and and under the nourishment of God and watch them grow up to be Christians for them to have happy lives Amen to understand the mercy and the grace of almighty God you know I thought boy I you know I was thinking you know how how how you know some of us are having children and I'm thinking bringing children into this age in your mind it's almost crazy but I thought you know as long as you plan on educating them as long as you are watching over them the way that they are supposed to be watched over then you got something still amen you just have to watch that you don't you know the public schools and everything else right but see you can still do it it's still something that is in our nature to have children we should have children amen we have a desire to have children and so forth it's just a terrible age amen so I thought you know all of that look at how how that everything has it its place even the church has its place that it's supposed to be in amen and then uh you you know we could go into detail of how the devil doesn't like that I want to get your attention the devil doesn't like when a church has a group of people that love one another when they get along with each other they don't gossip about each other they don't think bad things about each other huh they don't say bad things about each other but they are unified group and I'll tell you right now uh any preacher it's a job to make sure that that stuff stays out amen because if you don't it'll creep in amen the devil will try to get in there any way that he can amen and then when you're walking along like Brother David said look at our worship service my anybody come up here and begin to lead songs when the church is all in it and sing it it's inspiring it's you know it's inspiring and that's the way that it should be amen amen we want we want it to be that way but you know it's like I said the devil's business to try to get in there somehow and get you out of that original state that you're supposed to be in how about let's take one example amen of course we won't go all the way way back to the Garden of Eden we haven't got all night but let's go up to David bring it all the way up to David and how that he was on the back side of the desert he had such a relationship with almighty God that God told Samuel to go and take that anointing oil Ando my king you know and how he did with all of his Jesse's family and so forth but all come down to him and he says yeah I got one more but he's out there you know he's kind of to run of the family and you know and so yeah well bring him in that right but he brought him in and anoint him with oil and how did he went you know and and end up going down to the Philistines and uh not the Philistines but to the battle that his brothers were in whenever they were all uh surrounded by the big giant you know and and and being intimidated by the enemy and he come in there and he says you know he looked at that us he said what is wrong with you guys why are you all shaking in your shoes and hiding out in your fox holes and everything like that and and they said well this giant man I'll tell you what nobody wants to take it and he's challenged them you know uh that that if let's not let everybody die but let's just get two of two people Let them fight and whoever wins the other one will become servant you know and and they had an agreement and David you know of course he had a couple of experiences on the back side of the desert so to speak ain't that right how many believes it's important to have those backside of the desert's experience with almighty God Amen so whenever whenever your brother or your sister perhaps comes up against a giant you don't have have to be there shaking with you know you say no brother I'll tell you our God is big enough to take care of your problem he's big enough to fight this devil that you're fighting I don't care what it is whether it's nervousness or whether it's h anxiety or whether it's depression or whatever it might be there you are and you can be an encouragement ain't that right amen you can be an encouragement because you've had a bear and a lion that you've dealt with amen or or so and there he was David you know innocent little David and and he come down there and my what what what that all was about and and I'll tell you what right now it had to be a tense moment it had to be a very unsure moment whenever David said he would take him and no doubt but the gossip went through the whole Camp yeah there is somebody that's going to take this giant on you know and it's a little water boy it's the water boy the water boy is going to take him on yeah he's bringing them food food and water right and stuff and and the water boy is going to take him on water oh no you know and man he had to be unsure is that right but David you know went out there with a sling that right I don't care how close he got it was unsure and this little guy oh got K all armies of Israel here he's coming he's going out there y'all pray hard pray let's pray is that right they all be praying and they went all out there and and David got closer and got closer and got closer and and uh my my if there's such a s thing as video in heaven I would like to see that replay don't wouldn't you I want to hear him saying I'm going to kick you and I'm going to feed you to the birds with the end of my Spear and this that or the other am I a dog that you bring me this little little runt out here to fight me and all that other he said and David says you know I don't come to you in a sword and Spiel but I come into you in the name of the Lord and to say I'm a take your head off that's right now I'm going take your head off amen and I can just hear it going through the Foxhole hey he said he's going to take his head off he said he's going to take his head off he's going to take his head off and and all of a sudden guess what you know maybe the old John Rose up and he was flicking his muscles and everything and David went to slinging a't that right got his little sling out this work before flung it up there and everybody's eyes were on it ain't that right everybody's eyes were on it and I'll tell you what there might have been some kind of a thud when it went right between them that little helmet with a little Gap helmet with a little Gap and it I'll tell you what you talk about Bullseye is't that right it went right in there and he probably went stiff you know and so forth and they were wondering whether it ricocheted off did it Ricochet off of huh but when he fell backwards and the dust flew up boy can you imagine I want you to understand the way the prophet of God said that was giv them all inspiration because they all come up out of their fox holes went after the Philistines and chased them all wait till dark I I understand Ain that right amen and conquered them ain't that right and that's the way it is in our day hello brother Braham said he was like that David amen God used him like to be that David amen that while everybody was saying the days of Miracles past there's no such a thing as the Holy Ghost God don't heal anybody anymore he says well you just come and watch come and see amen amen and then what did that do Tommy Osborne Tom all these other brothers that did give all this inspiration and amen they went out healing amen it giv them inspiration here we are in 2024 brother Tommy needs still giving people inspiration hey they could bring a giant down we can bring Giants down Glory that's right amen you look at the book of um Revelations he says you know because Thou Art lukewarm and art neither cold nor hot amen you are miserable wretched poor blind look at what it cost look at that Church's condition because they did not stay with the original because they mix stuff I mean it does not work to mix anything with the word of God I want to tell you something tonight that it doesn't work for to make you for you to mix any kind of a sin or anything that's contrary to the word of God if you mix it in your life you will become dead you will become weak you will become like Samson as one of everybody else if you cross that word it doesn't mix but there was David and the inspiration to come from an man all the way at being Saul's uh you know Music Man and comforting him in all the things that he did is't that right getting Spears throw it at him and everything else all the way to becoming the king finally after all all that Fame and popularity cuz you know the Bible says that I will begin to glorify you I will begin to magnify you anybody and God had it takes God to do that and he would did that with David and allowing him to slay slaying those Giants and things am mean he come all the way up there to be the king and oh my how that he was at home perhaps and his armies were fighting for him and everything else until one day guess what he was out by on a rooftop somewhere and he seen a woman taking a bath ain't that right now one thing brother Bram said it was best sheba's fault that's what he said because first of all she shouldn't have been somewhere where somebody can see her taking a cotton picking bath well he didn't say cotton pick and I put that in there is't that right but anyway that's right that's what he said but then then because of that David what did he do he fell ain't that right he let sin come in in the mind he just thought he could keep on going but how many knows that goes to show that when you mix sin amen there's a it's a terrible thing it don't work and even though he thought that it was hid it wasn't hid God sees it how many know God does that in our life amen God sees our he sees everything about us amen you can't fool God you can fool yourself and fool others but you can't fool God Amen in that example we see how that David because of that mixing boy I'll tell you what my he brought a reproach upon the cause of Christ ain't that right and man for years he suffered terribly because of that mixing how nice it would be in the re reason I'm bringing this in is how nice it if it have been if David would have been stayed on track how many believes it's important to stay on track once you get on track stay on on track I like what Paul said having done all to stand stand therefore having your lines G about with truth and having all the shield up having your faith up to where you can quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen cuz how many knows that every one of us is oh we might be as spiritual as the brother random was huh but listen even he was fallible how many knows as long as you're human you're fallible even the prophet was fallible and he made mistakes he did things he shouldn't have done amen how nice it would have been for blood brandom he would have had a lot less stomach trouble and a whole lot of less pain and Agony for the next few years if he had just listen to the god listen to God and not going on up there with those men that time in Africa amen how much he how much better better off brother Brandon would have been and this is not in the notes it just comes to me as I'm thinking but what about brother brand look at brother brandham in his early Ministry when even his wife said look go with you I I'm with you I married you and I don't care what my mama said called him a bunch of trash this sat or the other but brother ran him listened to his mother-in-law and man oh man did it ever cost him he was even going over a Falls fixing the head over a Falls because his engine in his the boat wouldn't start that voice keep saying he he says you know what kind of trash is what kind of try I'm sorry I'm sorry that I listen to her isn't that right and finally that thing started up his wife child no matter how much he prayed God still took him home amen and I like that word took him home amen they're not lost I mean he didn't lose them he just separated them from them for a while amen God was teaching him and the pain and the agony amen it comes when you mix anything else in your life other than the word of God Amen because we're not supposed to mix anything else with it amen praise the Lord amen now let's let's look at this scripture here for a few minutes well I won't go into Samson daythan achen Moses Peter a't that right even Peter he kept saying oh you know not my hands only but also my hands not my feet only but also my hands and my head always putting something in it and whenever he after his new birth he cided kind of with the Jews and being circumcised and and and keeping some of the law and Paul had to come and said men what are you doing Paul had to correct Peter didn't he that's right even he got in trouble with Paul because he was you know going back to a little bit of the law and trying to lean to him and so forth and it but didn't do him any good amen but all of those but we won't go so much into that we want to talk a little bit about let's talk about the other side amen a little bit uh uh actually I want to talk about let's talk about hotbed plants because we know that uh let me see here brother baham says now what is a hot hbrd a hotbed plant he says it isn't the original plant he says and you have to keep spraying it all the time to keep the bugs off of it the bugs will eat it up but if it's original plant you don't have to spread it a good healthy plant he says a bag a bug won't crawl on it talking about the deserts not those plants man you don't got to go out there and water them you ain't got to do this out of the other how many how about these Tre trees and these Woods all around us and me we don't have to worry about going water I mean you ain't got to about oh well let's see if they got enough fertilizer Ain that right you ain't got to spray them this if they're where they're supposed to be everything goes just fine but you get a hybrid you get something that's mixed you got to spray it and keep the bugs off of it amen now I wrote down here some of the bugs what are some of the bugs the bugs of grumpiness amen that's right the grub BG the called a bitterbug sometimes it's so easy well somebody did me wrong it's amazing how many of those songs you could sing to a Christian well why don't you play me another what was it back in the old day another somebody done somebody wrong song well if you're a Christian folks you better get used to it world will hate you amen amen a and because of being done wrong and so forth we get a bit bug your bitter bug and then a frown comes on our face this is a bitter bug I'm so sad people don't treat me right how many how many lives of on whether or not people treat you right no we don't we don't go by that you don't go by what how people treat you you go by what you do with how people treat you amen the qu of attitude you have amen bugs of attitude how many knows we don't want no attitude amen bugs of despising or a grudge bug Grudge bug oh it's easy to hold a grudge sometimes we say well I don't hold a grudge but way down in there better make sure who many knows you better dig deep make sure that you don't hold a grudge call The Grudge bug amen well now if I'm an original plant and that don't crawl on me brother BR says a original plant bugs no if you're prayed up the way you're supposed to pre prayed up and then you'll do like the prophet says Ah he didn't mean to do that she didn't mean to do that that's a good way to keep that bug right off of you because the devil wants you to get that bug he wants you to have that attitude or that bitterness that's what he wants amen another place I was reading about how you don't have to Baby people he was talking about well SI sister tells somebody else to come come to church sometime you come with me and then I'll go with you sometime brother says you ain't got to do that that's hybrid amen hybrid we don't want to be hybrid do we no we don't want to be hybrid we want to be original amen rugged Christian amen all right now let me see where we're at praise the Lord what's a hybrid all right don't have to be stay sprayed and stuff like that it's original a plant you don't have to spray it because it's good and healthy it's a good and healthy bug brother Bram is talking to his doctor friend he says what makes disease come into the human body as I'm told by my precious doctor friend of mine and I'll go on and listen he says a book in his office he had where he keeps all of these books of the lead latest stuff on medicine he says what it is what makes uh brings diseases and sickness is weakness he says your body you say well my body's really run down you'll take a cold right quick isn't that the truth you get so War out so that's when it's the easiest time for a bug or a sickness or a cold or something to come in and how many knows that applies spiritually spiritually when you're spirit weak that's the easiest time for a bug to crawl on you or a disease to come in amen see and because that weakness in your body produces a mucous out of your glands and then that old cold germ beds itself and you got a cal but if that body was strong it would throw away amen that cold germ it just couldn't touch it you so you see God constructed a man in the first place and he was immune from any disease but unbelief in science and education has took it away from him amen praise the L remember you don't have to pet Christians Christians are rugged there are men and women of God who stand for God regardless of what anybody else has got to say about it you don't have to beg them and persuade them perfume them or baby them around that's hot bed plants he says that's not good at all they'll never produce anything the next one he talks about he says and he was talking about took a bird for an example but he another place he talks about eggs how that a hen can baby those eggs and roll them and you know get on top of them eggs and just baby them and oh my until she's so starved hardly she can't even hardly get around anymore but if them little eggs if she hadn't been with that rooster before them eggs and if they aren't fertile all the baby and in the world they'll still never produce anything amen amen I'm going to say it it comes to my mind I'm the pastor of a church and I'm here to tell you I have learned that baby in people doesn't really work I'm telling you it really doesn't work if anything protoplasma stimulation Works a little better than babying amen oh I just don't know I don't think anybody cared me get off of it and and quit your whine and Does It Better oh yeah you poor thing we'll try to be a little nicer to you and it don't work amen now we want to be nice hello be there for each other and all of that but it's not what we go by amen that's right all right I hope I don't get too hard but this is just the way it is is that all right I believe brother uh Phil bondre he liked the way he put it he says you know when Moses went to cry and to God he says why are you crying to me he wanted to give him a good whooping a't that right why are you crying to me get up and stand up here like a man and and and go speak the word amen why I cry speak praise the Lord amen can you imagine oh my how about our oh I don't want to get political here I better not everybody crying and whining when they say something a little about somebody isn't that right oh he said this he's a racist or she's a a racist but yet they all do the same thing and it's okay when they do it I like the ones that I listen to out there here oh well if you if you can't handle it why don't you put a helmet on that's the way they talk to them put them right in their place amen how many believ we've gotten too soft that's right this whole generation brother baham has gotten way too soft man's becoming soft they're becoming hybrids he says you take 50 years ago a ball game you never heard of an accident he's not to kill a dozen a year it's like a guinea he says knocks him out but he's dead Bob Fitz Simmons and Colbert corbert and John Sullivan those men who fought as many as 125 rounds in the afternoon and one round wasn't two or three minutes it was a knockdown knock one another down 25 five times in the afternoon all along and they didn't have no feather bed over their hands just hands amen like boxers have today there was Bare fisted and could take a 2x4 inch punch and bust a 2x4 with their hands they could stand that they were men amen that's why I read this scripture here a while ago about amen these real genuine men amen we are troubled on every side brother Bram says you know we don't flower we don't come up here and say well now why don't you become a Christian it's so nice and God's going to bless you and he said man God's going to bless your business he's going to give you Cadillacs he's going to do all this good stuff for you and this that or the other prise some a blood flowery bed of EAS bunch of hot PL hot bed plants amen no troubled on every side welcome to trouble welcome to trials ain't that right that's what we should say welcome to persecution welcome to tests amen you might get cast down amen but you're not forsaken distressed but you're not perplexed amen perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken amen always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus amen listen to what he said these little so-called vitamin fed rickys brother ROM got rough they've got a feather bed on and they you got to stop almost boxing is so soft oh my have you heard that in the Olympics where this gender of a man whooped the girl I guess in about some just a few seconds and had her crying huh I wished I'm going to just say it I wish i' have been that girl for a minute let him whoop me you I'd get up and say you mean you're such a of a man that you got to fight a girl but you're a real huh that's a real let them hear I ain't got a video camera up here you let them all here that's right why a man that has to go and change and and fight in the woman's ring of course the women of course shouldn't be fighting at all anyway right but anyway that's where the world's gotten to ain't that right man's got so soft nothing in him no more great big giant looking thing a bunch of blubber it's all it is just exactly what the Bible said it would be that go weaker and wiser amen then he goes to talking about some other things about the food where women are becoming the whole generation BEC extinct almost if we keep going the way that we are and that's just about the truth we don't have any homes anymore our government don't promote families anymore amen called JC Vance weird that guy's weird and behind them is all of those and they supported all of that mockery of the Lord's Supper a bunch of weird looking hair dudes and weird looking Freaks and everything else and and we're the weird ones huh oh my what has the world come to that's right what's it come to exactly like the even the church has come to it just a bunch of hybrid they've crossed it with the B baptism of the Holy Ghost for church affiliation and like I said a while ago once again recapping on Revelations there he says they had become neither cold nor warm but lukewarm therefore and knowest not that thou wretched miserable poor blind and naked because they mixed amen how many believes if you get lukewarm you're going to going to be mixed not worth a whole lot amen but real men of God are rugged listen to what he says now he saw this was actually the last quote on a certain quote that I wanted to bring when it looks like everything's gone wrong God's giving you a trial he's got confidence in you you're not a hotbed plant you're a hybrid you're a real Christian God's giving you a test see what you'll do about it remember now God counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail this you to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God you that you have found favor with god wow I had a sticky P Sticky Thing up here he says well I'll be glad for the day that we don't have to preach on trials and troubles anymore wouldn't it be nice if I could come up and say no there's no trials no test no no hard time no as long as you're alive and sucking air you're going to experience tests and trials and hardships things are going to come your way but whatever comes your way amen is allow of God I hope every one of you have a absolutely problemist week this week I hope everything goes good amen but I sure ain't going to promise it God only knows what we're going to face this week what you're going to face this week but if you do have a test you do have a trial I want you to understand something that you found favor with God according to the prophet of God and God believes that you'll stand the test just like job said man he said God said he's a perfect servant there's none like him in all the Earth there's nobody like job he's a perfect man he's my pride and joy how many knows Paul man he knews what it was like to be forsaken stripes and imprison ments and all these other things he knows how to both have have plenty and how to suffer need and when he said that there in Philippians I believe it is he says I have learned this one thing I have learned to do that is in whatever state that I'm in I'm still original I'm content whatever state whatever comes my way I'll stay in my place that God has placed me I won't let it move me how many believes a real uh genuine person of God not a hot plant amen they can fulfill reel I mean Romans 8 he says you know that uh you what shall separate is from the love of God persecution distress ain't that right all these things nay not life not death not anything shall be able to separate me from the love that is in Christ Jesus that is a real genuine son and daughter of God i' bet plant can can't take one little slap one slap on the cheek but Peter I mean Jesus Promised You this and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God blessed are ye that are hungry now for ye shall be filled he never said no you're never going to suffer need you're never going to be hungry he said blessed are you if you do amen he knew what it was coming a that right I mean the very Master our Master our Lord was hung on a pole and crucified false accused isn't that right he died under capital punishment because of false accusations false testimony lies so when people lie about you don't let that they lied about him too hung him on on the tree and every one of the disciples except John the Revelator amen were killed in some terrible manner P Paul even having his head cut off amen I always thought that was a pretty good quick way to go brother Woody have one of the big old axes come up there and just a good sharp knife you'd feel a little sting and be about it probably huh I don't want to burn though I don't like the find idea of fire but how many knows down through Dark Ages they got roasted on poles roasted alive but you couldn't get that hot hot not it wasn't that real genuine Christian to give in no he was rugged just lay out a c that offers you every pleasure you can imagine and you refrain why because you're Aug good could be everywhere anywhere but sitting in pews right now but you're rugged you're in church you overpower the flesh isn't that right flesh wants one thing but the spirit says another rugged Christians oh my 68 million of them brother Brad we're going to have a long hand shaking time aren't we we're going to have a long time of shaking a lot of folks hands what age did you come out of oh I was there in the 1300s and I was there in the 1400s and 1500s and I lived in the cave and we had to hide brother I'll tell you what if they found you you was going to your Arena that's right they had the Lions hello David wasn't the only one to kill a lion lot of Christians had to fight lions thrust through with the sword killed in every manner if there's ever was amen people that died ruthlessly under and the most horriblest ways it's Christians amen and you wait you wait till the bride goes ain't that right woe to the inhabiters of the earth then for the devil has come down to you and he knows that he has but a short time but bram's talked about he says you go pray for somebody if you don't have permission they'll shoot you but rugged Christians you take him I remember martyr's mirror I got to have a book I don't know if we have books like that brother but get us some original martyr mirror book back there Abraham Lincoln he was he was molded brother Bram says because of Godly mother the Bible and the fox's book of Martyrs I remember many times amen sitting by the coal stove in the winter time and wind whistling and everything else and going through martyr's mirror book and looking at those that were coming and having their head come back up out and their bellies were already fat and full from water and they had made them suck water and drowning them trying to get them to recant is't that right but you can't drown it out of a genuine pure bread no you can't you they' rather suck their lungs full of water and go over to the other world than to succumb to the devil's temptation of giving in because they're fixing to drown or be buried or burnt or have uh you know the what is that thing something that closes in on you it's got razor blade and spikes and and it comes together and kills you in that way or if you said something against the Pope that had a barrel lined with razor blades to roll you around in Cruel punishment amen cruel things they suffered but to hell why because there's something in there they wouldn't give up for the world how many's with me tonight there's something in my heart here that I won't give up for no pleasure for no Lea no matter how tempting it might be to just to be live a life of these no huh rugged Christians are rugged they're pedigree I like pedigree Christians brother brandom said amen all right see job he was God's servant he's my pride and joy sure Satan said if he gets that's because he gets what he asks for said let me have him once I'll make him curse you to your face I'll just make him curse you God said he's in your hands but you can't take his life see God had confidence in job amen and it goes to show that if you do have a trial if you do have a test it's because God has confidence in you amen is't that a wonderful way to look at it and say you know man I'll tell you what I didn't see this coming but that's always the time the ones that gets us right the ones we don't see coming and no matter how ready we are we're not ready we thought we were ready but we're not and the best oh boy here you go listen carefully the best trials are the ones that you really can't control don't have no control of you can't change it if you tried no matter how you try how hard you try you can't change it those are the best ones because if you could you would that's when you find out what you're really made of um May I'll just say what comes to my brain right now if you ain't tough you aren't going to make it in this world Amen that's right you have to be tough amen tough to defeat and come against evil and things that want to upset you and tear you apart amen that wants to change your character amen and we won't let the devil do it will we no even Jesus didn't bless us a flowery bed of ease he said blessed are you when men shall hate you and shall separate you from their company amen and reproach you say bad things about you cast your name out as evil for the son of man sake Rejoice ye in that day and leap for Joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in like manner also did their Prophet did their fathers unto the prophets but woe unto you that are rich and that you have reached your consolation woe to you that are full for ye shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn wo unto you when men all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets so you think in the Dark Ages you realize that those people were made to look as uh evil people they had to die as evil people amen a whole lot like today if you're conservative or a Christians they'll try to make you look like you're a hater that you're evil that you're wrong huh not only that and then they would have to actually give their life they were hungry they suffered hunger amen but over on the other side it's going to be different amen how many beli that we're in this hour you and I we have it like bu Brandon I'll just quote the prophet of God we have it too nice our softness doesn't do a lot for us no that's why you better be double praying I'm just going to say it this way if you have it really nice you better get to praying real hard because it's easy to get soft in that time off guard in that time lazy in that time amen help us all brother Bram talked about the dog lady I call her the dog lady because he called her a dog remember that woman came to him and want to be healed want healing and and and he says you know it's not meat to give the children's bread to dogs their generation their their race was to him call them dogs but B says boy the Pentecostals they have huffed and blo and they have never come back there again but that didn't shake that woman's Faith cuz he said that she was not a hot bed plant she was pedigree she had real faith and she acknowledged yeah that's all we are that's right that's right you don't want to give the children's bread to the dogs but guess what even the dogs like to eat the crumbs that fou from the master's table at first he wouldn't even answer her remember that amen and then he says that you know and my why and that we get that famous saying the same famous phrase that amen she had the kind of faith that God himself couldn't stop because those were discouraging stopping words but yet she had the kind of faith that God couldn't even stop her brother brand preached on perseverance that's what God loves to see in his children perseverance down in here that when the going gets hard guess what oh I won't never forget I I forget I think it was when I came back from that tent meeting over there in Virginia amen and and and I came back and preached on how that when a when you put pressure on a Christian it just makes them stronger amen when Wind Blows against a Christian it just makes their Roots get deeper it works the exact opposite of what the devil wants it to work he wants you to have road rage he wants you to get mad and upset and blow up but instead it makes you get on your prayer bones and get deeper in God Amen how many's glad for that for a Christian that's how those things work but for an unbeliever in a hot bed plant like brother bam said I think somewhere right here he says no wonder Peter said these fiery trials why count it all Jo Joy it's more precious to you than gold and all these many times many times we Hy and we Haul he says but that's just something that's God God has given you to overcome he knows you'll do it he's put his trust in you amen trials and tests and things that come your way they're just to see whether you're a hot bit plant or not they're just there to see whether you really have the goods that you claim to have or whether you're not if you're a pedigree Christian ain't that right 68 million of our brothers and our sisters stood to test of physical harm physical harm most of us probably can handle all kinds of things but the one thing that we would Sherk at is I you know if he's going to put a knife to my throat if he's going to put have G gone to me if he's going to threaten me with my life then I we wouldn't be used to that would we and hopefully we won't have to because I don't think the bride will go through that those type of things but you need to understand that back in the day you had better be ready for those type of things amen down through those ages all the way to Luther they tried to get Luther amen but he had some princes and some other countries that gave him Safe Harbor a that right kept and protected him because the ones that did what he he did before him ended up getting killed he was just one of the first ones that the Lord says no this is my messenger I'm going to keep him alive ain't that right and does anybody ever say it hardly ever you wouldn't hear it hardly politicians nobody says hey what about it you Catholic religion that killed 68 million so-called Christians down through the Dark Ages ain't that right oh they keep hush hush why probably because they've got the majority of the power even over our country and we probably don't even know it ain't that right even as the prophet of God said amen let's stand tonight musicians if you'll come and see if you can pull that song up Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart in my my heart I like that song Don't you a real genuine Christians there's another song I wouldn't mind singing amen and that is oh I'd rather be an oldtime Christian than anything I know I would like to be a millionaire with a million to be stole but I'd rather be an oldtime Christian than anything I know amen while he's looking that up let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you father at the closing of another day another service another time that we've gotten to be able to come together Lord to speak to your people father the wonderful words of life and Lord we just ask God that you'd help each and everyone here Lord to keep

separate us from you keep it out of our Lives Lord keep us walking humbly and reverently before you that we might be pleasing to you Lord Jesus we don't want to be a hot bed or hybd plant we want the original we want to be back the way that we're supposed to be father ready to meet you in the air and we know that you're going to redo and re get that Garden of Eden ready again father and we're going to go back to the Garden of Eden just ass sure as there's a world today we ask God that you just continue to lead and to guide direct each one of us here tonight Lord and we raise your hands and
