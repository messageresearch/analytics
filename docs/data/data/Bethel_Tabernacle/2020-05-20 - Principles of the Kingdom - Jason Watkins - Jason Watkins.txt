amen happy to be here in the house of the Lord tonight glad that y'all could make it out praise the Lord we're still going along with our partial audience and we're just still trying to be careful for a testimony sake I I you know we're watching for the official word when they seem to be okay with gathering everybody back at the same time and not having to worry too much about having enough room to be tall distance apart now we're hoping hoping hoping hoping that that's by the first weekend in June there's no way to know so I just weirdest would have see we'll see how it goes but that's what my intention is as of tonight if if you know if the Greeks don't rise as they say if too many if it doesn't go backwards and they start you know reeling everything in again then I hope by my best estimate we should be able to have the whole assembly back amen by the first weekend of June how many Oh pray amen we want to be gathering back amen praise the Lord Romans chapter 12 want to speak to you tonight we've been speaking about this as a theme and I want to take - a title tonight principles of the kingdom we've been talking about that as a theme about you know how many believe we're Kings children well brother BAM said when you're kings child you should act like that and so the Bible is very clear how that we should act and I love that the scripture doesn't just burden you with with legalism what the scripture does is help you act the right way by telling you how to think and so it first tells us what kind of mind to have because God knows if you've got the right mental attitude toward his word then then the manifestation will just show up and your flesh amen as ministers you know every minister knows that you know when you're when you're seeing the lack of that manifestation of the word in people's lives you're not you're not thinking in your mind I can tell you I don't as a minister I'm not thinking oh wow reprobate people you know know what I'm what I'm realizing is is that people don't have the right value for the word might be very good people God's family elect jean of god but but that doesn't guarantee that you will have the right mental attitude toward his word because i can see a lot of times that the you know the the the the lack of a proper manifestation there's a lack of it's missing because there's not the right mental appreciation for what god had to say about our lives and I think I made the point early on that the Bible does not just it doesn't in a majority it doesn't in a majority it does not in a majority deal with getting you to heaven it deals with that about 50 percent it's not a majority it's about 50 percent and the other half of the Bible is teaching you how to live while you're here amen so it's not just all about getting you there that's that's half of it but it's also about helping you to live here before you go there amen and so you know I want to live the way he wants me to live a man praise the Lord Romans chapter 12 would just have a few verses here we'll read verses one two and three in Romans 12 verses one through three I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you this is so vital not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith so God has given us a revelation of how to think of what to believe how that it should conduct our lives and we should never you don't never want to set your - - to you know present yourself as a greater authority over what needs to go on in your life than the one who made you okay but you amazingly see people do that all the time they think they know what's best for them even if it flies in the face of God's principles in his word so we want to deal with that tonight let's pray father we thank you for you this word thank you for your rapid anointing that I already feel thank you Lord for these people who have gathered tonight now be with both speaker and hearer I just call myself and humble myself now lord I want to be an Oracle of you I want to take no thought of my own I just want to stay out of your way so help me now Lord Jesus let let my human side just go away into the background and may you come now and take over the vessel and use your gift it's yours you built it you installed it you you service it you operate it it's yours completely so Lord I completely give it to you now in Jesus name help me now - to do that what's purposed in my heart in Jesus name Amen god bless friends you can be seated praise the Lord so I want you brother Mac give me that verse in Romans again please Romans 12 and let's read through it again a little more slowly because I want to bring some things to your attention so he begins here I beseech you brethren I beseech you therefore brethren and you know that word therefore means that you know in in light of everything that I've said previously now that all being true and if and if we don't have the time to go through it all but you know he talks about all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom of and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments his ways past finding out he deals with about a lot of that and and how Israel would be saved and and and he takes a lot of time to that church there in Rome to express to them not only you know it's it's one thing to express what God's plan is but you really need to start with this God has a plan I want you to get that God has a plan he's not figuring this out as he goes he's not caught off guard and and that's why with perfect faith and authority God can say to you and even command you don't fear it would've be an offense to God for you to be afraid of any circumstance I get the human things can come up and there's an alarm and there's your startled and there might can be a fear of not talking about that I'm talking about in the realm of your soul where faith ought to back up and say wait a minute I'm a child of God he's got this and I don't know what's going to happen it looks fearful but I'm making a decision I therefore in light of everything Paul has taught me by the mercies of God I'm going to present my body a sacrifice in other words I'm going to cast down thinking I'm gonna cast down my plans gonna forget my agenda see cuz my agenda should have been laid aside when I married the word a man when because the word is mine mate that the Reaper the revealed word that's your mate the divinely revealed word that's Christ you understand we're the Bride of Christ and and God made it clear to the woman that thy desire shall be to thy husband so whatever plans you had sister whatever your aspirations and your dreams when you fell in love with the man and you took his name you also take his his agenda his plans his goals you absorb that you take on his name you take on his dreams you share in what God has led him and you as a wife you Stepan's beside that and you be a help to his revelation see my desire shall be to thy husband so your agenda should be to thy husband your desires your plans whatever you have in life that you want out of life and listen friends you didn't put yourself here you ought not to be trying to control your life while you're here you ought to say you put me here you gave me a battle plan you gave me marching orders and I just want to know what you want me to do Lord and I plan to go forward and and and and and the only way that I'm guaranteed success and don't measure success by human standard whatever you do because God will give you success that to the world would look like unsuccess though to the world God's vision of success for you can look like folly to the world but you know God is not mocked because you know what the world calls success God calls foolishness and I'm sorry but I'll take his interpretation of what's wise and what's foolish because I already see the folly of men all I got to do is look at the perfection that I see in nature and I figure out real quick who I want to follow hey man we gonna follow mankind that and then he has his whole history is a history of kingdoms rising and kingdoms falling kingdoms starting out great and then kingdoms crashing and burning and that's the logic you're gonna follow you're gonna follow humanism and man's philosophy he hasn't been able to sustain himself for 6,000 years he's constantly burning his own house down and burning nations down and if it wasn't for the mercy of God the world would have done been in ashes so I have no problem looking thee you know the world in the eye and saying go on with your bad self I will follow the Lord I will take what he thinks about how I ought to live and so he says so you know present your bodies a living sacrifice there is no way it is it is you can there's no way to justify that you are presenting your bodies a living sacrifice if you're refusing his thoughts for your life if you're calling your own shots and making your own decisions I'm sorry I'm not saying you're not a child of God I'm just simply saying you need to understand who the father is and who the child is I have it happen all the time you know and I tell you over the years it becomes a great you know painful wound when I because because now that I you know you you you you gain wisdom that's an advantage of gray hair that's an advantage of years length of days you gain perspective yeah that's why bread they asked for the bread and he said you know if God you know you know which would you rather have the first you know 25 second 25 you know or the last and he said I'd like to have the last quarter because he said now he said I wouldn't jump at things he said I'm more stable I'm I'm more I'm you know yeah he's older and hit the body's breaking down and brother branham said everyday and I get out of bed I got a new pain but he's understanding more how to operate as a servant of God see and you know I and and stop trying to be the hero and just let him be the hero so you know but but and so that's an advantage the the the I don't know to call it a dark side but I'll call it a painful side is also with length of years especially in pastoring is you see the mistakes that you tried to warn families about when they were young and raising young children and you saw the direction they were going was not according to the principles of his word and you could see that it wasn't and you know a lot of times friends when you get into situations I want to make this statement early because we're talking about principles of the kingdom principles of God's Word there are plenty of Commandments in the Bible but a lot of what the Bible teaches you is principles because you're going to get in situations where you're you're looking at a situation and you can't find a direct Scripture and you don't know what does the word tell me to do about this and it's right in front of you and you've got to make a decision and you want to make the right one I'm gonna here to tell you something friends a lot of times you're Ground Zero and you can't really see it take the principle of God's Word because the principles flying at fifty thousand feet it can see the whole thing and God knows the direction so I don't know what's over the hill but I know that's the direction I need to go because that's where the North Star is pointing me to so brother Brandon would preach a sermon out of the Bible turning northward and so we realized that you know God has principles in his word that that a lot of times people say I'm not sure what God's Word says about this when you're not then you know it's light it's like principles are like the instruments you know in an aircraft a lot of times you're flying by sight but sometimes you get in a situation like it's dark or you're in clouds or you're in a storm and the truth is you can't see the horizon you don't even know which ways up that pilots know this brother John could testify to this tonight you can become disoriented and think you're you're flying upward because you're pulling back on the stick don't know you're inverted and when you pull back on the stick you're doing that and pilots have flew straight into the earth doing that so you've got to be rated on your instruments that when you can't see you've got to look at your instruments they will tell you your attitude your altitude your pitch your speed and you got to be able to trust that don't take some friends we're in a time where there's a lot we don't know but I do know I have an instrument panel I don't know I can't see it's a cloudy way things are happening that have never happened the bride is facing things she's never faced so I'm looking at my instrument I am for sure not looking at it politics I'm for sure not looking the science I'm for sure not looking to theology I got an instrument panel in front of me I don't have to be able to see where I'm going this knows where I am and it knows where I need to be and it knows how to get me from here to there safely people can get in their life and think they're going along fine say hey I'm flying Heena yeah you know you know not to not not to disparage the dead at all you know the pilot of Kobe Bryant the basketball star and Kobe and his daughter I promise you they didn't leave that day intending to crash and die and here's the here's the reality they were flying until they weren't they didn't know that what he said well I've got a lot of aptitude I'm doing good well so did they they had altitude but there was a hill a mountain in front of them they couldn't see they went into a bank and all visibility was lost and they flew full-speed almost 200 miles an hour into the side of a mountain so a lot of times people people think you know I'm going along and this is looking good and I think it's the right thing and all the time I'm looking at the instrument panel I'm looking over their shoulder as a pastor and I'm looking at the instrument panel I'm going I think you need to pull up oh no I'm going right along we're happy everything is coming up roses yeah I think you need to pull up like now like yeah pump up now pump right now right now and if you don't then you won't be flying in a few minutes so that's tragic that's only half the tragedy the other half of the tragedy is there's no redos many times people fly into a mountain in their life because they wouldn't trust the instrument panel of God's Word and they crashed and there was no way to rebuild the plane they might have barely survived with their own life or the lives of their children and I've seen that happen so many times in long years in pastoring two and a half decades have caused a lot of heartache a lot of heartache I can promise you the heartache that you suffer is not really so much heartache I've had people be against me that's water off a duck's back really you know it's not everybody's gonna love me or appreciate me that's fine whatever you know people do you're wrong talk about you you get over that stuff but what you don't get over is when you see people who you loved and you cared about it you still love them you still cared about it and you see and you see their their family in pieces and their children in pieces and it's all because you were trying to get them to follow the principles and they wouldn't do it and then and then the next generation comes along and then you see their children who now they're rising up and now they're making the same decisions and they're going in the same way and they're ignoring the same ins panel and they're saying well I'm living a Christian life by the commandments but what about the principles because the kingdom of God is governed by the principles and then God has a way now there is a way that seemeth right to a man the end there up flies into a mountain alright so you're to present your body a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God it's your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world now watch because I told you thoughts precede your actions so he's saying in your actions don't be conformed to the world but be here's the remedy be transformed in the renewing of your mind if you don't want to conform to the world into their actions I promise you you don't have enough willpower to resist that so you've got to be renewed in your mind and not just in a new birth but you need to be renewed daily daily in the Word of God that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you have an opportunity to be a trophy of that verse that in your life God can sent a rent you as a symbol of somebody who proved his word was true and proved in their life that his word works and it and his word is then on display and that's why God can say to the devil have you considered my trophy job have you considered a man who doesn't go by his own thinking and this is even before the Holy Ghost he goes by my word he considers my word and everything he does job proves what is a good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say to you through the grace when verse 3 did you take it down verse 3 for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is a among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith so so we find then that that we have a a reasonable service now you know we you have a legal term you know reasonable and usual and you know I was discussing this before the errand today and we were talking about the legal ramifications you know of what is reasonable and in in in laws of civil trials and criminal trials and and a lot of times it you know you might have done something that's the law you broke a law and then if it's negligent now then then you're you know you're even you're even found to be even more guilty not only can they get you in criminal they can get you in civil and then if you even if you didn't break a criminal law they can still get you in civil and sue you because you were negligent and you know the whole whole idea of what's reasonable and usual now I wanna I want to kind of ask this question for a minute do you imagine and and is somewhat of a loaded question and I'm sure your answer is going to be no if you're a believer you know it is is our reasonable and usual the same as the world know because the world has an idea of what's reasonable and usual we have a completely different notion of what's reasonable and usual Amen so you know is there anything you know by the world standards now is there anything worldly reasonable or worldly usable you usual about your service to God well the answer again of course is no my service to God looks different than the world thinks it should be the world has a notion they've got a notion of what it means to be a usual Christian and it's a million they've got an idea of what it means and they will say to you you know you know you you you you need to be reasonable I mean you know you women you men your children your homes why do you have this and you don't have that you're allowing you don't allow and you go to here you you you you you you you pay your ties you attend to church you know you've got all these things I mean don't you realize you don't even really need to do that anymore you know wives are independent they don't really need to be under subjection to their husbands anymore and and you know and the world looks at you and says you know it's it's unreasonable I had a man attacked me terribly through an email doesn't even know me and and just just you know waylaid the whole notion of a woman being in the modern 21st century that a woman is in subjection to her husband said I should be investigated what he said I said she fell hit her brother a man I was gonna have a errand ride him back and blow him up I don't know if he did or not he certainly can but I decided just to not respond to him at least at this as far as tonight is concerned so to this point today I haven't responded but but you know it's it's it's just it's so so we have a whole different reasonable than usual the world would hold you in contempt for many of your actions but God will love you for what the world holds you in contempt how upside down is that how far away is the world's thinking if they literally think about this friends they came at Jesus who was the most perfect human being ever to exist brother Luther don't bring me some water please think Bradley forgot me amen and I just bring me a bottled water right quick really the run jump flip hurry amen and so you know the the the whole idea of what we would classify and they take Jesus if you think you stand a chance come on they took the most perfect human to ever live who had zero Kyle was always totally honest thought none wrong spoke none wrong did nothing wrong loved even his enemies preached and observed and lived a life that did good to those who were plotting to murder him hung on a cross with full authority to condemn them to hell by a word thank you sir they're faint hung in his mouth all he had to do was say father condemned them for they have killed me without cause but what did he actually say Father forgive them now if they if they thought they called him mad crazy accuse him of having a devil in fact his accused him of being the chief of Devils you're not gonna get worse miscalculation you're not gonna get a worse judgment then third judgment of the Lord Jesus Christ so so now then then then you have to ask yourself a question I'm just talking about in simple human terms if they did that to the most flawless perfect perfect flawless divine man to ever live then how do you imagine that they're going to be able to make right decisions according to God's principles and if that's true and you can and you are here with me tonight and you're determining there's no way what they reasonable they they thought Jesus was unreasonable he was the most reasonable man ever to live so if that's the way they assess life why would you trust them and follow mankind why would you follow humanistic thinking for even a second why would you not rather say to yourself self you know nothing and he knows everything and my determination is to know nothing save him and him crucified and you know and if he had to get crude if he had a Calvary I got a Calvary coming I'm aware I'm willing I want to raise with him then I gotta be willing to die with him I gotta be willing to suffer with him and that's not usual that's not reasonable the world says that's nuts don't do that you don't have to do that it's the reason I do it is cause I don't have to the whole reason I do it is because I want to be like him and I want to endure whatever he endured and make every decision he made I already don't always and I'm already in enough agony for when I don't I'm sure not gonna knock on purpose I'm gonna try every day I'm gonna renew my mind I'm gonna be renewed in my mind every day so that I can prove what is that good and perfect will of God that which is acceptable to God I don't care what's acceptable to mankind not here to impress him not here to you know impress mankind I'm here to impress God I don't need the plaudits of the world I just want to hear the maker of the world say well done enter into the joys I've prepared for you before the foundation of the world so you know I would say that what you would call reasonable or usual I would say it depends on what kingdom you come from I think that dictates your definition of aníbal and usual you know when we look at the world we can see what humanism where man puts human hitman pit man has voted that mankind is the highest order that's convenient voted yourself into the Supremes 5 ok well can you keep the breath in your lungs ok can you control that ok can you guarantee me that you'll be alive tomorrow can you guarantee me you'll make it home tonight can you guarantee me you won't fall over in the next 28 seconds so then why you know I say to these humanists then why would I trust you you voted yourself as the as the chief being but you can't even keep yourself alive you can't bring yourself here keep yourself here or figure out or have any effect on where you're going afterwards that's all in the hands of your maker so excuse me if I just go step around you and just appeal to the make up a man so humanism has what it has done to Scripture ah you know to the to the principles in the estimation of man man has estimated that God's Word has very little value now you can see that in the world and I'm not really here tonight I I don't want to keep seeming like I'm just it's it's God's family vs. the world because I'm really trying to zero in a little closer tonight I really wanted to say look it's a no-brainer so far what I've preached to Christians is a no-brainer because of course we're going to believe him and of course we thank him and of course we don't trust mankind but but you know now let's come down into the family of God and let's say okay now now our controlled study now now we've got everybody that's believers alright now consider as a Christian are you surrendering your life as a sacrifice are you on a daily basis living and making decisions based on his principles for a happy healthy life a happy healthy home a happy healthy marriage happy healthy children happy healthy finances happy healthy churches happy ha you know I mean are you considering that God has a an exact plan for all of that or are you winging it and flying by the seat of your pants and just trying to go your own way I can tell you friends that you are in for one calamity followed by another which are followed by another and then another still because now we're talking about God lining up his family for a final flight a family that he can't lose and he won't sacrifice and so he's going to get you you know you're going to have to get certified your pilot's skills are going to have to be able to be certified because God's planning a trip out of here so you know when we when we think about what God has done in the world and I I think about you know Christ when he you know in his first coming or actually you know we could break it down and talk about all three Exodus the first exodus of Israel out of Egypt then Christ the second Exodus when he took the Old Testament Saints to glory resurrect to the mountain of graves of many which set saints which slept arose and then there's the last Exodus and so you you know that second Exodus is the first advent of Christ of God in human form as a man to pay redemptions price and now he's coming again this is the second coming of Christ and it will be the third Exodus for the bride you with me and we see the exact same patterns repeating in all three cases now when I see that I have to conclude its God doing it if we look at the first Exodus ah you know there there was a pressure upon the children of Israel and you know Israel Israel had a number of commands upon them you know there were they were to eat certain foods and not eat other foods they were to wear certain garments and not wear other garments their church services now here's an interesting one because their church services like if you take with Moab and brother branham talks about bail on that false prophet and you know Israel you know they have their altar and moth has their altar and they have the lamb they have a lamb they have seven on they have seven you understand they've even got a prophet they've even got a prophet and God speaks to both of them they believe in Jehovah they believe in Jehovah they're descendants of Abraham they're descendants of Abraham through through lot and so we find that that it was it was what the one thing that separated them was their hearts response to God's principles and what God taught in the Bible because you know they were Israel was very different than the Canaanites who lived around them they ate different foods they wore different clothing they worshiped on different in different ways and so when it comes to the world they were vastly different God's family has always been vastly different whenever God's chosen children of Israel conducted themselves in manners and ways that were like ah the Canaanites around them or the Egyptians when they were in captivity there was always a penalty always a price to be paid it's the same today I see people who I have every confidence they are God's family I have every confidence but I also know when I see them you know when I see the rod of Correction coming I know who's doing it and people say oh you know God you know pastor pray pray help me know I've done all these calamities got all these problems and here the whole time I'm knowing I'm seeing because I've been watching and I'm seeing so how what is it you think I can do you think I my prayers gonna stop him I'm happy to pray if the Devils attacking you but I'm here to taste some friends if the Lord's attacking you there's nothing I can do for you he sent His Word and healed you so go to his word you need healing and it's God doing it go to his word you need deliverance go to his word you need help you go to his word you got a problem you're upside down you're in a calamity go to his word there's nothing I can I can pray for you I'm happy to pray for you but my prayer is Lord humble that person until they say a man who every word see so so you know they they had to go through these things and you know Israel's practical lifestyle you know it was it was not to be like the world it wasn't supposed to be anyway and so so when we find that their standards are reasonable unusual are vastly different and when and when God looks at that that whole situation of the Feast of bel pure I mean really it looked so similar it does look like to church services very similar just like today you could go to a church service where they read this exact same Bible they sing the very same songs they raise their hand it's like you do and in many cases cry authentic tears like you do feel joy and elation like you do and and in no way to know no way to know had it not been for prophet who could come back into the instrument panel and say they're actually worshipping the devil and don't know it and the undie and they say well what is at the heart of this thing but at the heart of it it's a good way to ask it because at the heart of it was the heart of them and there heart response to the Word of God and so you say well that doesn't seem like that big of a deal God looks at your heart in such a way that you know it wasn't that the action was all that different wasn't that the church services role that different but this church over here in Moab had a different a different heart response to God's Word and when God's family went in that direction God began to destroy them and they it actually became unpardonable it wasn't that their actions were all that different it was that their heart would not allow God to be the Lord and in their heart and I have seen sadly sadly children of God made that same mistake and get thinking like the world and become reasonable and usual you know I have to ask this question so here we've been you know for the last what I don't know eight ten weeks you know in a situation that's totally totally unprecedented this has never happened in the message never since the days of brother Branham never not in America anyway we're we're believers have been told you know you need to stay home you can't even come to church and we've had to go you know with just a little they allowed us ten people as long as everybody followed protocols will well you know just what it's trying to you know keep in a key keeping it'll barely possible and even they've been arresting pastors and writing tickets and people even you know and he it's it's gotten to the point where the Attorney General of the United States it's actually taking his valuable time to write memorandums to the governors to say listen what you're doing is starting to encroach upon constitutional freedoms so now this ain't this ain't you know you know somebody some no-name john doe over here writing an article thinking you know ranting and raving standing out in his yard screaming waving a flag going fringing on their rights this is the top law man in the United States the Attorney General the AG of the nation he's the top law man and he is warning to say you need to be careful and and and further I want to know why is it that churches and religious services aren't considered essential and and let me tell you something friends you know you you say well come on we've had to we've had to be careful and yeah I get it the safety and we you know it's a pandemic so it's reasonable I get it we've been following it but don't think for one minute that men with devious minds I'm not saying they're all got devious minds but I'm saying there are devious men with hidden agendas who are going Wow look what we were able to do don't be naive friends we're currently we got a president that seems to be sticking up for us and an AG that seems to be sitting up force that could change in an election I'm not here to put put fear I'm here to stay I'm here to tell you you better sharpen up your instrument panel because I don't know what's ahead of us we're in an unprecedented hour we're in a moment we've never had to face these things for but I know there are principles in God's Word and I intend to follow them I intend to follow them when we look at thee and I'm gonna come to a close and I'ma take the last 15 minutes when you come to Israel and they're coming to their partner they're in the approaching stages of their Exodus things begin to gel quickly they'd went for decades decades had turned into centuries one century became two became three became four and now they're still got decades which didn't seem to be in the original plan where this extra thirty years come from because God said 400 now we're at four thirty and we're still here but we heard there's a prophet you see and God begins to move and now now a prophet comes in he's got a message of Exodus and there's a people that begin to rally and then you've got a government starting to notice and it's down here for eats conspiracy I'm just telling you these are Bible patterns and then you you find that pressure starts and Israel's trying to leave but now there's pressure from the powers that be there's religious pressure and and the the if you know anything about that that that time period that era in Egypt so you know the Pharaoh was was like the son of God so you had search and state perfectly married and so now you've got this ecclesiastical and this political and this demon power which brother him said it's that tri-unity of political religious and demon power so then now you you come and they start to bring all this pressure and you know the story I'm not going to spend a lot of time in that first Exodus we've we've studied it since the days of childhood and Sunday school but you know but I just want to make this one point every pressure that they encountered was needed because they they they weren't going to a picnic they're headed to a wilderness journey they're headed to they're gonna have to fight and take over lands and have figure out how to form an army they're gonna have to learn to follow water they're gonna have to you know there's a lot ahead of them and so God in those final moments those final days God is allowing this kind of pressure to come upon them and you know the one thing that you don't see Moses doing was you know adjusting the life away from God's principles to to kind of ease the pressure a little bit actually Moses begins to do things that increase the pressure upon because he's following the principles of what God had told him now you come to Jesus day you see all these characters now begin to begin to jump up you you know my mind I thought about you know here you've got you've got Israel under under Roman control and now you know and by and and now you you know you've got a you've got a Caesar and you know and and the days of the Republic are long ago gone hundreds of years gone and and you know and and and now it's an imperial government and it's and it's church and state United and you've got all these laws and they don't care about the Jews God they don't care about any the Jewish God they don't know they don't recognize them at all look at all these stipulations and they're starting to clamp down on Jewish worship and clamp down on Jewish lifestyle and you've got God's family right there in the middle of it you suddenly suddenly you've got Joseph and Mary having to make a ridiculous arduous trip over many days and travel and married pregnant all about taxes and and and they can't even get a motel and and I mean you know you've got you've got you've got Zacharias and John's coming and he disbelieves and he's got a penalty and now he can't speak you got all this pressure you got you got blind Anna who's you know going around can't see God's not healing her you got her going around God's got a purpose that in her blindness the Holy Spirit can lead her right to the child you understand you you you you you've got you know you got Simeon old and broken-down and shuffling along and you think he could just go on to his reward but he wanted to see Messiah and every day was a hardship and every day wasn't endurance but every day he was faithful every day as it got harder and harder and Joseph kept going and Mary kept going and then nine months all the persecutions she suffered I'm here to taste something when Christ was coming in his first Advent it wasn't a better roses for his family and you had people who were you know kind of over here trying to ride the fence and and and and and if I could if I couldn't you know move the turn lukewarm into that era to say you got you got you know lukewarm Jews who looking for a messiah but they won't come right out a 10-9 and take a stand and they go to him in the middle of the night I mean you got all this Street that's playing out and you're seeing it again in this hour you got people who ought to be taking a stand for God's worth afraid to do it you got people who are who are compromising you know you've got Matthew who was it was a tax collector and cheating people Zack he is cheating people and tax collection and and God's going to get ahold of their life and turn their lives around you know and and and you got you've got you know believers make believers and unbelievers their life then wasn't much different than there was a reasonable and usual then and they were also called crazy and you've got all this suffering and then you've got a king trying to kill the child and Joseph's got to flee to Egypt and I mean that looks counterintuitive brother Bram said anytime a Jew leaves the Promised Land he's back slid but God sitting there just like God sent David into the Philistines to save his life we don't always understand why this is happening like that but I'm here to tell you David Koepp trusting the word I'm an Italian Joseph kept trusting the word Mary kept believing the word it didn't all make sense to her it didn't make sense to everybody but they knew it promised he'll be here and they begin to see signs of it and they begin to say I'm a believer I'm a follower they didn't always have a God didn't send him down a PDF every day of their marching orders sometimes they had to just walk by faith this was real life happening in real time in HD just back then just like it is now Christ goes off the scene he ascends he sends back his life into the church and now you've got a you got it you got a a bunch of mechanic field cowards sheltering in place working from home all of them gathered in an upper room afraid fear until the Holy Ghost came and they came out of that shelter I'm gonna take some friends what you know that shelter in place ended up being for their good because over that time where they were having the shelter in place they were looking at the scriptures they were considering the prophecies they knew what Jesus had told them I wonder what we have done with our shelter in place time I wonder if you know maybe you're out there tonight and and maybe you and I and I don't want to get going down this road but maybe you know you should have been here in service tonight but you've become reasonable and usual and you're thinking and now you're yeah you're suddenly the Bible is said gather the more so as you see the Day approaching Gavin you're gonna need it you're gonna need the strength you're gonna need the we're gonna need the strength you give you're gonna need the strength weaken you're gonna need washed by the water of the word you're gonna need a live ministry you can't just stay home and play tapes and think you'll be okay that's not the principle he ascended on high and gave gifts unto men and brother branham said you have to be in a local church and support a ministry and go there and get washed in the water but some people and over these eight or ten weeks I'm afraid have become reasonable and usual by the world standards and it's even less important than it was before and they've actually went backwards I'm here to take something friends I'm not here to tell you that I'm emerging as a super-duper Christian but I know this I've tried to take my time let's say Lord let me draw closer and you don't want to avoid the pressure you don't want to avoid that because you know you need the struggle that's a principle of the kingdom of God I get it in this rat race of the world it's a struggle to come to church in the middle of the week you need the struggle it's a it's a struggle to stand separate from the world sometimes it'll hurt your business to do it sometimes you'll get ridiculed sometimes family will will hold you in derision and and sometimes that the public will sneer you and you don't like that and so what you'll do is you'll become a little more usual you become a little more reasonable and we we all agreed here tonight at the beginning of this sermon that our level of reasonable and usual ought not to be the same as the world taste something friends they came out of that effort room I'm here to tell you they're sheltering in place had a benefit they came out of there on fire they came out of there winning souls they came baptizing people they filled up the Church of God has God added daily ain't it signs and wonders and miracles and shut the whole countryside Oh would the God while the world is shaking in fear and uncertainty that there'd be a people on the earth to say I am facing this challenge of the hour and I'm ready to see God come on the scene I'm gonna prove in my life what is that God and perfect will of Almighty God and God will honor it and God will vindicate it I'm here to tell you something this word will speak you haven't believed cunningly devised tales you're believing the body where you're feeding on the body part of the Son of Man and it will speak it will testify you don't have to be afraid you just have to decide what you want we love going into x4 and reading about how that that they come in there and they get down to pray oh god do great signs and wonders by the name of thy Holy Child Jesus and here it comes again rushing wind shakes the building the Holy Ghost pours out again fiery baptism and everybody's rejoicing do you know what you know what brought that once before that Peter and John are being locked up and threatened and harassed and whipped on and and they you don't hear to tell you they needed that struggle don't try to protect yourself put your hands in the hand of God and let God direct your life march forward design it's a beautiful Zion not here to become reasonable and usual I'm here to be on fire I'm here to serve God with fervency I'm here at the 3rd Exodus this is for real this ain't a story of pipe dream Disney show this is for real we are getting out of here and I don't know what tomorrow holds but I know who holds it hallelujah III don't know what the plan is but I know there's a plan I don't I don't I already know I can't control it but I know somebody who can so I'm sticking with him I'm not interested in coming I'm not interested in coming to the end of this shelter-in-place order only to find myself more reasonable and usual that's not what happened and it in Egypt that's not what happened in the upper room that's not what is happening that's not the group that's leaving here I'm gonna take something friends you need the struggle don't fear the struggle I speaking to a a really wonderful sister today a very good friend and we were talking about that very thing and I said just to remember we need this struggle you know just encouraging her don't fear it we need it it's good for us you gotta press it yeah you must I you know do I you know get a flower bed of ease as brother Brandon would sing while others fall to win the prize and sail through bloody sees no way friends I don't I don't wanna I don't wanna you know float on a flower bed across the finish line I want to run when I cross that line I want to have a sword in my hand and a shield on the other one and I want to have some battle marks on my armor that I fought to get here hallelujah not here to compromise I'm not here to become usual don't be usual Christian they follow the Holy Ghost be full of the word trust in the principles of God's Word let them govern your life stop preventing them from governing your life because you can don't do that surrender humble as these opens the verse I beseech you therefore brethren therefore having said everything I just said about the salvation in Christ the mercy of God now that you know that I beg you I urge you I I compel you therefore in light of everything I've taught you by the mercies of God that you present yourselves don't wait for God to always have to knock you in the head I've have had to learn so many lessons like that I know so many times I prayed Lord show me your will don't let me have to miss it and get up get cracked in the head I know it'll be for my good but it hurts I don't like it I'd rather just figure out what your will is and just let me do it and if you'll just show me what it is I'm gonna do it before I know what it is I'm gonna tell you something friends you make that kind of commitment to God you get his attention and God will do things for you in such a miraculous way I urge you to present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God it's your reasonable not worldly reasonable not humanism reasonable not usual but it is your reasonable by God's standard this is your reasonable service I love him don't you you know you you you you you you have these health benefits that we can gain in the Word of God if we'll follow it the Word of God is health to all your flesh it's got--it's it's to the point now you know and I'll make this last point and close because on my mind to make it you know there are things that seem counterintuitive that that can actually be for your health for instance okay let's take the scripture assemble yourselves more well sometimes I get overloaded and worn out I've done it twice in over 25 years and I take a 30 day break say wow aren't you violating the Bible you're like assembling less and brother Brandon would go into the wilderness so wilderness rest even though the principle it seems counterintuitive to the principle because you look at that and go but if the Bible says I should assemble more how could it possibly be helpful to go into the wilderness to rest and I'm away from church but actually it is and brother Branham had to do it and it was healthy then he could come back stronger but now after a while it stopped being healthy and it could start being hurtful what if brother Branham went out there for six months 10 months he tried to do that he tried to go out there for the rest of his life and God said go ahead you'll be like that bum you saw see so you go out there now I'm just showing you an example sometimes things can seem counterintuitive but it's actually can be for help fasting fasting is counterintuitive because you're supposed to eat to keep your life going if you stop eating you will die but if you fast for a certain amount of time it can actually have a health benefit but keep it up and it flips and it's no longer a health benefit you get me you know it's been healthy for us to shelter in place we've had an our global pandemic it's been healthy for our testimony it's been healthy for you to stay at home I hope you've been listening to tapes I hope a tape a day or keep the doctor away or in sister Debbie's case two or three tapes a day keep the doctor away every time I come in my house I have to wait and hold by the mute button if I walk in brother Ben's gonna be blasting all right I thought when I get out of sister James house as a child I get away from that I just married right into it and both of the important women in my life blast brother branham's tapes wide open you walk in the door you just get hit by it that's what I say praise the Lord Amen hallelujah and it's like brother Dale was saying one time was talking about the scripture you know I've bought a piece of land and I pray have me excused by there and was talking about this Sunday I've married you know I bought a yoke of oxen I go to prove it please have me excused another one said I've married a wife and I can't come and brother Dale we're right in the middle of us serious spiritual conversation I'm almost in tears and anointed and brother Dale just jumps in huh I'm married wife and she makes me come and he has four years given sister Joanne the credit for the spirituality and I I agree with him a man a man I was a good friend so and he agrees with me he knows we got good girls that Lord knew what we needed and and but my point is so okay so it's been good for our testimony it's been healthy you've been listening to tapes I hope you've increased your prayer life I hope we needed to do it I know the Bible said a symbol more but we actually assembled not last we're simple zero ten of us a little skeleton crew enough brothers just to get a broadcast phone and the rest of you for a week stayed at home it seems counterintuitive but actually if you did it right you're healthier but keep it going it's not gonna be healthy keep it going so I'm listening to tapes that's not the primary way that God gave you to get perfected listening to tapes are an augmentation God sent a live ministry among us God sent a pastor to help you God sent evangelists and teachers God sent prophets God sent apostles God sent a prophet thank God cuz this pastor wouldn't have nothing to say if I didn't have a prophet to lean on I couldn't help you at all I wouldn't be able to give you any kind of advice I'm glad for thus saith the Lord I believe you should hear the synthoid every day multiple times a day it ought to be playing in your truck you're to be well something you you want to put something in your ears and word let it be the voice of God's prophet but don't imagine that can substitute for coming back to the house of God because you say well I've been doing good I'm flying a night yeah Kobe was flying until he wasn't here taste something friends the principle of God's Word is this as you see the Day approaching gather more you're gonna need it you're gonna need it you're gonna need it you do need it let's stand you know brother uh never brother Diggs was talking about that that some people have gotten so comfortable they may never come back to going to church again they may have convinced themselves erroneously I can just do this for now on I love it it's awesome we're we're more spiritual that could be true that could be true but it won't stay true it won't stay true you understand I'm not saying you're wrong if you think that you're more spiritual having eight weeks at home listening to tapes that that absolutely should be true but it won't stay true not in this day and time friends not in the 21st century not when they're not when it's Satan's Eden I'm gonna take something you need to be here in the presence of Almighty God we need to get on past this and let's get back to what God says as usual and reasonable amen praise the Lord I've got a couple of prayer requests let me because it's already well 22:9 let me read these for you and when we have Bradley sing and then we will love okay cooperate please all right let me get to my request list we on Wednesdays we've just been leaving leaving you where you are rather than gathering up here I think we did it one time when they're just a couple of brothers here but we'll leave you where you are right now distanced it's all about our testimony friends it's really worth that's really what it's about at this point okay so brother Luther I don't remember if we ever I'm gonna read it the one that you put in that last Wednesday that we missed brother Luther says a contractor that I interact with from work his wife Sherry Hightower Hightower's battling breast cancer and cancer growths in her spine and lung mine you know you think it's an accident that this man met brother Luther Jordan who just so happens to be a son of the king those things don't happen accidentally friends I'm here to believe that we can join brother Luther and God could go and have mercy on this woman and it could redound to God's glory and come back as a testimony we've seen it happen I'm gonna pray and believe it like that sister Elizabeth Johnson writes she'd had a car crash some years ago I think 30 years ago and it set up a situation in her knee she's having I have a knee replacement surgery scheduled for May 28 so that's eight days from now there'd be like next Thursday right for May 28th please pray for me and the surgeon for successful surgery I need to make sure I leave that on there we'll catch it again such Elizabeth would catch that again also again next Wednesday because I think that'll be the day before you go and we'll pray for it tonight as well my sister-in-law Karen white says her son Brandon he ever wanted to meet a sweet boy who was Brandon and you know very much like my brother Nate you know troubles of life caught him he went off the rail and has had a hard life and a lot of drug and alcohol abuse and they took him to the doctor just the other night to the ER and I mean he was almost like he was going to die and so they are they they think maybe they thought he had a complete collapse in his liver and now they're looking at some other different things but he's been very sick but his mother who who her and her husband have recently within the last I would say two months maybe started streaming here and give their hearts to the Lord and are serving God watching listening right now in this service as we speak and say god bless her brother Greg and we prayed and she called and she was crying and I know though I know it broken a mother with a broken heart sound when I hear it and it was her it's her baby he's big strapping big as Gideon but it but here he was Brandon and he was on the edge and we were praying and overnight he made some improvement and today he's holding on but you know you can crash over the edge right quick when you're that when you're that unhealthy so she's asking us she talked to him about his soul Brandon give your heart to the Lord commit your life to Christ she didn't pull no punches I think thank God for a mom who just won't pull any punches and tell a son you better make your heart right in case this is it and so uh she says that he sounds a lot better but he's fighting a drug dealer so please please pray for God to take it away from him I assured her we would sister charity vassal was very sick today very sick was alarming the symptoms that she was having I don't know if anybody here has an update but I'd heard she was maybe in the I know she was in the yard I don't know if they admitted her but she's been extremely you know anything about it Chris um she's been very sick with some very weird symptoms a lot of tingling and numbness and all of her extremities and and turning gray and ashen and they're actually maybe examining her heart even so let's pray for sister charity tonight amen amen let's let's believe I think that was all let me check while I check this brother Brad let's sing some of that in the presence and of the king altogether now the praises [Applause] singing friends [Music] so I also just right before we came to church I was on the phone with brother Matt and sister Rachel it's been going on for a week or more maybe something's gimped up in her back and hey when you got as many irons in the fire sister Rachel she'll during a house full of young uns and her husband to take care of and you can't afford to go down in the back and I'm sympathetic to that I've had my share of back trouble and she's in a great deal of pain and then Gideon today came home with some type of become some kind of a stomach bug nauseated throwing up just started a new job today so we're gonna pray for Rachel and getting as well I have from my morning Bible study group you don't know any brother Ernesto he's the father of one of our Philippine brother this comes from brother Damon Boswell who's in my Bible study group he's going in for surgery and is asking for prayer a man also brother another brother brother johnny has had a lot of problems going on and has had some medical issues so amen let's let's pray for all of these things that's all that seems to have come in to me I checked every other source I don't see any other through email texts or whatsapp just a reminder send it to me direct and whatsapp if you have a request but that's all I have so far let's pray Master we want to thank you Lord for this gathering tonight I want to thank you for the the the word that comes forth and and and that you brought it forth and such with such earnestness Lord and such conviction father in my own heart and mind all throughout the day I've wondered how you had had all these notes Lord and outlines and discussions with other brothers but I wasn't altogether sure how you'd lay it all out once I got going but father I can testify you were right here every step of the way now Lord let all those who have believed your word be the beneficiaries of your word heal father deliver raise up Lord God strengthen I pray in the name of Jesus Lord for this woman sherry Hightower Lord this

relief to our sister we pray for Brandon Lord I pray father for my nephew that you will you reach your hand of mercy to him Lord God there was a time in his life Lord where he he served you with vigor and zeal and the enemy got ahold of him father discouraged he pulled him aside father but I am we're sending the Holy Spirit after he brought it on they entreat him with merciful hands tonight we're remembering our sister charity tonight we don't know the doctors haven't been able to figure it all out but Lord you know what the problem is bring healing go to our sister with healing in your wings
