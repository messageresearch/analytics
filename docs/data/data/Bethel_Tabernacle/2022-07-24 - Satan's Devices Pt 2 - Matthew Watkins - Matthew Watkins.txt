========================================

foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] s amen Ephesians chapter 4. we just want to continue where we were last Sunday on Satan's devices we're going to be looking at that again Ephesians 4 let's just begin reading that verse 17. this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as Gentiles walk and the vanity of their mind you can I'll mute that here so if we could put up someone could put up Ephesians 4 I see some people don't have their Bibles so I want to make sure we read that this morning Ephesians chapter 4 verse 17. catch up with me if you can Verse 18 having the understanding in Ephesians 4 18. having the understanding darken but being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who be in past filling have given themselves over until lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but you notice this verse 20 but you have not so learned Christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught in other words assuming that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus it's not in any man it's in Jesus right so that was our personality we don't follow personalities except one and that's the personality of Jesus right that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man notice that you put off the com that concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man you cannot attack your new nature you can't take your your old nature right and and and Tack it or let me say it this way you can't take the cross and Tack it to your own nature you've got to take your own nature and Tack it to the cross and say that's that's former all things the Bible says are dead and everything has become new so that means every part of you when you receive the when you receive Christ into your heart every part of you is changed can you say Amen and let's read that again verse verse 24 and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore putting away lying speaking notice put in the white line speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be ye angry and sin not what a mystery be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole still no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth you can be seated this morning we'll just have you be seated and we'll go through some of these I want you just to hold your place open to Ephesians chapter 4 and we're just going to go through this verse by verse let's look at it again in verse 25. so this is the new nature this is what happens when when we read Ephesians 4 we're reading applicable things that we could apply to our life you know when you read the Bible when you read it special Ephesians 4 and you read all the way down and we're going to get to verse 32 this morning you're not reading a way of life you're not reading a suggestion to live a good life you're not you're not reading this is this is this is just a way of life if you choose to live this way as a Believer but let me say this you're not reading a way of life but actually you're reading the way to life so this is the way to life if you want to live this is how you live so long before there was a religion that we call Christianity our religion was called the way that's what Jesus the religion that Jesus started was called the way they called them Christians first to Antioch because they were like Christ right so Christianity is just a name that we've termed people who are like Christ or people who are striving to be like Christ but long before they gave it Christianity it was called the way and Jesus gave that title himself when he said I am the way now he didn't say I'm away or a suggested way but I'm the way I'm the only way so there's only one way to get life and that's through Christ it's not through religion it's not through formality it's not through come conforming to something but you've got to get his nature to get life I know it's very simple but I just thought about these things this morning as the Lord was dealing with my heart how profound it is there's only one way to true life there's a lot of substitutes that give temporary pleasure and temporary happiness but let me just say this until you find until you're sowing that type of life it's really all corruption everything else is just corruption so it's the way not a way but the way there's only one way to life and what is true life this what we live here is not real life I know it's how we make sense of things in our uh you could call it our our data our feedback that we get is just this life it's our point of reference but really brother Brandon said this life is just a negative to a positive so everything that happens in this life is dying you're going one step every day you wake up you're one uh one day closer to a grave one day closer to corruption one day closer to your body breaking down your mind breaking down so this is only a negative but there is a life that we've tasted of that's why we're here this morning so we've we know what real life is because we've tasted of it so there's there's as Jesus said I am the way so when you find the way to life then you learn how to live the way of life so there's only one way of life and that's that's Christianity that's to be to be Christ to be like Christ let's back up and let's go to verse 25. you got your Bible if you got it just hold your place there open it uh with me Ephesians 4 wherefore putting away notice this is talking about putting away the old man putting on the new man which after God has created in righteousness and true holiness verse 25 wherefore putting away lying so one of the first attributes of a Christian is that they're truthful they're truthful with others and they're truthful with themself this is part of the new nature wherefore putting away line speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another so we we speak the truth that's why that's why when you are when you when you live hypocrisy and you don't speak the truth it's a breeding ground for pretense it's a breeding ground for facades and a lot of churches are just facades where people are so afraid of stepping on each other so we live in a culture where we're so afraid of stepping on each other's feelings that we don't ever speak the truth but you know the truth is the only thing that will set people free and I'm not talking about speaking the truth by holding up a sign out here on Boundary Street repent or perish and every time people drive by you've got a megaphone and you're screaming in their ears there's a way to speak the truth in love and not worldly perverted love not Hollywood movie Love but true Christian love let me just say this true Christian love christ-like love is polar opposite of Hollywood love amen so you speak the truth notice this very simple wherefore put it away line speak every man truth so when the truth is being spoken not just from the pulpit but from your lives when truth is being spoken when we're honest one with another when we can be honest with with one if there's any place you should be able to be honest and not uh not put on a facade it's around believers because there's real love where Believers are if there's not real love I doubt you're in the company of real believers so real Believers There's real love so you put away lying that means you put away you put away falsehood you put away dishonesty and you become honest now there's a way to do that you don't just you it doesn't mean to speak bluntly when someone you know asks you how do you like the color that I painted my new house well you don't have to just say oh it's terrible it's horrible well why did you say that well I've got to speak the truth and honesty I can't lie well there's a way to speak the truth that look right so he says here for wherefore putting away lines speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another this is an amazing verse verse 26. be ye angry so let's just pause there in other words this emotion is okay in and of itself it's okay being angry is okay it's what the Bible says be ye angry but there's a way to another you say brother Matt what is the purpose of this this is what he's saying because you find it right after he says be angry and sin not let not the sun go down on your wrath in other words you're going to be angry but I don't want you to do what the devil's devices is to do is for you to bottle up that anger because people have became unexpressive and they're not they're not able to express what they feel because they're afraid of of of shame or they're afraid of judgment or they're afraid of conflict and the Bible says be angry and sin not let not the sun go down in your wrath in other words it's you're going to be angry but don't bottle it up when a man when a husband and wife are angry at each other and they bottle it up then it becomes poisonous and it breeds bitterness and it breeds malice so Paul is saying be angry you're going to have to express it but don't sin so when does anger become sin when it becomes revengeful or it's anger that's expressed to be spiteful or it's anger that's expressed to tear someone down that's angry and sinning but when you're angry you're expressing something and you're not sinning that's a that's a miracle but we believe in miracles you can if you have the nature of Christ brother Brandon said even talks about a bad temper and I don't I don't want to uh misquote the prophet but it was something to the effect of how do you get rid of a bad temperament brother random says on your knees on your knees through prayer so be angry be emotional this is an emotion and we're to be emotional we're emotional creatures but the problem with just emotion non-tempered is that it's uncontrollable emotion and any emotion that's uncontrollable if that's not subject to the nature of Christ will always give you the wrong result but emotion that's tempered emotion that's humble emotion that has is is mixed with love emotion that's controlled by the Holy Spirit the Bible says express that be angry and sin not let not the son go down upon your wrath that's remember when we read these things this isn't a way of life it's the way of life it's the only way it's not well you have that you know brother Matt that's a good little be angry and sin not and don't let the sun go down in your wrath that that's all good and you know and fine and we'll try our best uh to do that no this is a command this is a this isn't this is a this is how to live a Christian Life Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath apologize make it right don't bottle it up because when it becomes bottled up then it breeds bitterness neither give place what a good thing to say right after fight after say and be angry and sin not let not the sun go down on your wrath neither give place to the devil don't let your anger give a place to the enemy because remember we preached on Wednesday on being changed and he'll take your emotions he'll take that conscience memory reason imagination affection and he'll stop it up stop up the flu and he'll take a place there and then you'll you'll blow up blow it up Christians remember that verse 28 let him that stole still no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth notice verse 29 let know corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth let me give how sometimes we interpret that in their mind do your best to limit corrupt communication do your best do your best to you know make it as as minimal as nope let know corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of building up to the use of reinforcement to the use I'm reading you what edifine means when when when real edification comes it's corrective can be corrective to the purpose of building to the purpose of restoring to the purpose of reconciling to the purpose of encouraging and so anytime it's doing anything opposite of that it's corrupt communication and what do we do when we preach the gospel we're communicating so the gospel can become even through the preached word can become corrupt corrosive communication when it's not tempered with love when it's not set in the right spirit I never forget when I first started preaching one of the first things my dad told me as one of his only piece of advice and I that I remember anyway and I was really one of his only pieces of his advice he said I get one piece of advice don't ever preach a pet peeve don't ever do it it's very simple don't ever preach a pet peeve don't ever preach your soapbox anytime you feel like you're coming behind the pulpit and you're preaching your pet peeve or things that are bothering you it'll never produce the result of the fruits of Christ never you never preach your pet peeve because you can say all the right things and I remember my uh it's funny my other father my wife's dad my father-in-law told me one time and he's famous for saying it you can be right and be 100 right in something but that doesn't give you the right to say it you can be right but if it's corrupt communication you don't have the right to say it so you can say all the right things but say it have all the right content or substance but if it's said with the wrong Spirit or the wrong attitude and you'll do no good you'll only do harm remember our very simple principle and you've heard it in in I'm sure many times before Do no harm you know I believe that should be the mo that should be the modus operandi of every Christian that you live by Do no harm when you're dealing with people do no harm you want to harm the devil you want to tear the devil's Kingdom down you want to destroy lies and addictions and chains and bondage that Satan puts people in then aim your gun towards the devil but don't ever let it aim towards your brother or your sister remember Jesus came to Legion and it wasn't Legion was not the man Legion was the name to identify the spirits of the addiction or the spirits of the trouble and so what the devil will get us to do is we'll take a person in our life who's struggling whether they're addicted their demon possessed they're dealing with demon spirits and if the devil could accomplish anything he'll get you to only see Legion and you don't see the man that's Bound By The Spirits because remember he wasn't he was a son of God that had been bound and don't ever let the devil confuse that tell you that they're the same person they're not behind that bondage is a Son of God or a daughter of God and you've always got to see the soul behind the problem always hello everybody here you awake let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed into the day of Redemption all these things tie together let all somebody say oh let all bitterness and Wrath and anger we just said be angry and sin not let all bitterness and Wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking that's backbiting tattling grumbling gossiping and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice these are the things that corrupt the Mind these are the things that corrupt the spirit and when we dwell on these things and we allow these things to come into our Channel we can never express Christ in his true nature and be ye Hind remember I preached this taught this last Sunday kindness is an attribute of a Christian rudeness is not the attribute of a Christian to be rude is not expressing the nature of Christ but rather be kind be ye kind that kind of bar you know those kind bars they're biblical you should eat more of them and be Ye Ye kind one to another tenderhearted we can we're going to take more time on coming Sundays to teach this be a kind tenderhearted forgiving one another that means that your brother and your sister is going to do things where you're going to have to forgive yeah right or else was why would he say forgive one another if he didn't know that we're going to step on each other we're going to step on each other's pain we're going to step on each other's complex in a body of believers now what the devil would like to do is he would like to take those pains and those when someone hurts your feelings or that you don't like what the preacher said or you think he's preaching against you you think nobody loves you he'd love to take you and to separate you and put you over isolated on an island and then give you streaming of course he's not going to cut you totally off he'll put you on an island give you a monitor a TV in the internet and say here just have streamed Church and what can I get away from stream church I then I don't have to have my feelings hurt then nobody can step on me then no one can hurt me then I don't have to be around people and I don't like people I don't want to be around people people just hurt people now you laugh and we Snicker and it's funny but this is the devices of the devil because God intended for you to be in a body where you can get your feelings hurt I said that right God intends for us to be a body where we can step on each other and hurt each other but forgive each other and whereby grow and mature into the statue of a perfect man so if I hurt your feelings forgive me I'm asking for your forgiveness we should we should do that if I hurt you forgive me I'm just a person I'm just a man full of mistakes full of faults and full of failures I don't always say everything right I'm not always right though I might think I'm always right but I'm not and you may say the same exact thing so we he says forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake of hath forgiven you let's read what the prophet says before we close we just end on some of these if I only read these quotes today then this would be a success I'd really wanted to get to these uh quotations just before we close now another thing that has taken place this is an enticing Spirits uh uh just this is let me go let me go we dealt a lot with brother Brandon preaching about Discord and he said I've never I've never tried to separate or sow Discord among Brethren you were to relate just to recap he'd relate how he would go into special meetings where there was lots of churches and he would use these words they've been taught in their own sphere of belief and he says now in those meetings why not not at my local church he says but when I go into to meetings where I have people from everywhere and he says I never Veer off into things that might so Discord I stick with the fundamentals everything we can all agree upon why because he was a gentleman full of the Holy Spirit and he cared about people and he loved people because Jesus cares about people and he loves people his family his children right and he says the gentleman notice the very last part in bold a gentleman wouldn't do that let alone a Christian certainly not we read this in Proverbs 6 about how the things that the Lord hates is he that soweth Discord is one of those we write about second Timothy the attributes of a true servant of the Lord must not strive means he can't quarrel he's not going to argue he's not going to fuss he's got to be General apt to teach patient and meekness instructing those that oppose himself it's true saying if a man desire office of a bishop he desire a good work go on to the very verse three not given to Wine no Striker not greedy a filthy looker but patient not a brawler not Covetous Titus Bishop must be blameless as the steward of God not self-willed not soon angry not given to Wine no Striker there it is again not given to Filthy looker this is in conferences as long as Satan can keep you firing at one another he just sits back and said brother I don't even have to fight as long as Satan can get us fighting one another inward fighting then he says I'll put my gun down I don't even need to fight they're shooting each other this is god making his promise and you wonder what's happened to you that's what's happened you change your nature you become a woof or a goat instead of a lamb and that's what's a matter with the Pentecostal church today it's snorting and puffing and enough temper to fight a buzz Saul and then wonder what went with the Holy Ghost backbitings fightings and everything else amongst the Christian church and wonder where went the Holy Ghost I I I'll just ask you a very direct question how many would raise a hand and say I want the holy ghost in my home so that Holy Ghost is a nature I'll raise my hand too the Holy Ghost is a nature it's the nature of the Lamb it's the nature of the dove and brother random says you wonder where the Holy Ghost went when there's temper and anger in the home and backbiting and arguing and fussing and then we want the Holy Ghost I say Lord help us he says in fightings everything else amongst the Christian church and wonder where went the Holy Ghost the holy spirit will not abide on such a thing that's right it can't do it if the lamb he says if that if that lamb would have made one snort Like the Wolf away would have went the Dove and today why we just do everything we go everywhere act like the world tell dirty jokes and everything else and smoke and drink are Deacon boards even our pastors dance and carry on and then expect the Holy Spirit to dwell in such a place like that never now a lot of people love to read this quote and go see there see that's the real attribute that's the attributes of the of the Holy Ghost you don't drink you don't smoke you don't tell dirty jokes well let's let's that's right but can you read the rest of the quote not only that but you fuss and fight and bat and stew and argue against I'm Oneness and I'm trinitarian and you ain't got nothing you haven't got you haven't either as long as you act like that I belong to the assemblies I belong to this and I belong to that I go to this brother's church and this is my pastor over here I belong to this I belong to that why don't you belong to Christ you draw now just a minute ago he was speaking about the nature of the lamb and the Dove and the Wolf and snorting and he was saying what is that snorting like that woof he says all the smoking and you're drinking and you're and all of those things go now he's saying and also you draw a little denominational barriers and separate Fellowship separate the Brotherhood and then wonder why you don't have Miracles and things happening in your church wonder why every time I read that I just go wonder why there's no miracles in my life wonder why there's no miraculous in my home and I'm praying for it wonder why you don't have Miracles and things happening and The Miracle Worker has gone that's right no wonder you can't believe in the Divine work and of the Holy Spirit it isn't with you no more if somebody would come to me something contrary I would kind of misunderstand it myself I wouldn't want to criticize what anyone says we're not to criticize each other I'm not guilty of doing that I thank the Lord I notice here's here's an important distinction because was brother random just a jellyfish brother Matt you're just preaching this Gospel of inclusion and you just include everybody was brother Brandon inclusive did he just include everybody and didn't matter how you dressed didn't matter how you look didn't matter how you lived he compromised on Trinity did he compromise on the Trinity if you believe that you don't believe the message but so somehow he was able to have disagreements he was able to stand for the word he was able to be uncompromising he was able to hold a two-edges uh his hand on a two-edged sword but keep the right attitude and spirit and never Target people but Target spirits and he says I'm not guilty of doing that I have criticized sin and unbelief but no individual person see I don't we are brothers and sisters striving how many are striving we are coming down to where sister Florence came yesterday morning she we all got to come that way and it's not my purpose to try to criticize a brother or sister that wouldn't agree with you far be it for me to do that I don't think you'll ever find a tape that I ever caught anybody's name on which I have felt that many times the person was wrong but that's between them and God but what is wrong in the way of sin and misunderstanding sometimes so brother Adam's trying to make a distinction here I have criticized sin and the spirits that but that destroy and bind people cold cold Spirits formal Spirits brother Brandon preached against coldness formality lukewarmness but he did it in a way to build up and not tear anyone down he was tearing the devil's King
