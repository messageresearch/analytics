if we could amen we want to turn straight to the word Judges chapter 13 Thank You Amen brothers and sister sister Dorothy a man good to have you here with us tonight and then we want to look straight to the word this evening in judges chapter 13 and have just a lot upon her heart we'd like to speak on tonight judges chapter 13 tells us the story of a man who we are very familiar with and we want to look at his life as well as the life of Samson and as the man we're referring to and also the life of Jacob let's begin here reading it Judges chapter 13 amen trust that the stream is going good and everything is good amen god bless you all of you at home and all of you watching by way of livestream and then we have a small group here amen miss everybody greatly miss us all gathering together amen but we're just glad we have this means to be able to minister and connect with you so we just trust that the Lord would bless you in your home here tonight amen I'd like to speak to you tonight on a thought the Lord gave me I've titled the value of the Spirit the value of the Spirit let's begin reading here at verse 3 of Judges chapter 13 and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now they won't barren embarrass not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for lo thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of God came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God very terrible but I asked him not whence he was neither told me his name but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive even beerus son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eating the unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death verse 9 and God hearkened to the voice of Manoah and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoa her husband was not with her Lord we thank you for this reading of your word tonight we distrust and lean upon you Father your divine grace that it would be bestowed upon us Lord we ask God here tonight that you would take these words that you've put upon my heart may they touch a life Lord here tonight those that are connected by way of live stream we pray father that you would just Lord may your word reach every single one of those that it was intended to hear it we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated this morning Thank You brothers sister Dorothy amen judges chapter 13 just keep your Bible open through 14 and 15 and 16 we're going to come to a few of these scriptures here it's an amazing thing when you study the life of this man Samson and the Bible tells us a lot about him and a lot about the choices that he makes Samson's life is made up of many choices and and it led him to such a place of such such a such a disgrace his life starts out here in judges chapter 13 and we know the story the the light that the story is very well so we'll only touch on them just briefly but it's amazing because we find that choice is such an important thing in our life every decision that we make every judgment call that we make both large and small ultimately it's it's every choice that we make in our life has some form of consequence the large decisions the small decisions the small choices really life is made up of a great array of choices both large and small and we know that that we things that we listen to the things that we to come into the gates of our soul is a choice that we have as an individual the places that we go the type are the places where we choose employment the church that we go to the the police the place where we live the friends that we have and those that we choose to associate with these are all things that are our choice that God left up to us as many things God does for us and God shapes portions of our life but yet God still leaves it up to us to make the choice and to make the right one and so we know that in the larger grand picture what we find is after we look at a choice and we look at choice after choice what we notice is a pattern well you can look over a man like Samson's life and and you can you can link it very much with ours as the scripture says that these were written for our examples and so we learn from their successes and we learn from their mistakes the Bible says that that that ultimately what we find out here from the life of Samson is we notice with all choices even in our own life we begin to see a pattern we can watch and see a trajectory we can watch and see a an ebb and a flow of life and many of us can go down memories lane and we can begin to take account and and we could say you know not not I'm just speaking naturally here we could say that we've arrived the station that we find ourself in life we've arrived at our the life that we live now and we can look back and we could start to look at the choices and say the the circumstances are such because of a choice that was made our decision that I chose to make and and you know sometimes it's great to look at some of those things and say you know I have what I have today spiritually because of very natural choices that I made in my life you see life is made up of very sometimes serving the Lord is a very natural experience sometimes we live in the ethereal and we live in great spiritual revival but what we find is that many times some of the choices that we make that seem so insignificant is actually serving the Lord and it can feel so natural and so small and just so normal but this is exactly how God has designed our life and he's designed life that way you'll see here that Samson's life where he ended up and where we end up in life ultimately our final destination or the final result of where our life ends up is made up of small choices Sampson learns this and you could follow this throughout the entire scripture and we're gonna hold your Bible open here to Judges chapter 13 we'll continue from there to 14 but we find out that Samson the Bible says God anoints this man's life he he wasn't we know and we're not gonna spend time on this but we know he wasn't filled with the Holy Spirit as we are by the baptism of the Holy Ghost through in their birth but Samson was filled with the Spirit meaning that he was anointed with the Ruach or the breath of God this was an enabling that God gave it's how Samson could slay Philistines it's how Shamgar would slay the listings that God the Holy Spirit was available to David that's why he could pray in Psalms 51 depart from not for me take not thine Holy Spirit for me so there there was an anointing that came over Samson's life it was a very special anointing because the scripture says it was something he was born with that he would begin to he would begin to deliver the Israelites from their oppressors and we know that they had many oppressors the scripture says that they had lived in a state of rebellion and so now the Philistines are going to be used as God's weapon to - to persecute or to judge the nation of Israel and they're going to begin to afflict them and they're going to become a weapon against them but ultimately for a good purpose and so God says that they begin to cry and they cry out and the scripture starts here in judges 13 and God says I've heard the cries of my people and he says that I'm gonna begin to deliver them through through men through judges now the word judge actually means Savior it's not a sense of a savior like a redeemer like we find in Christ but that word Savior simply means that it begins to save the people from their afflictions so Samson was a mini Savior he was saving the people we know he spoke of the the his life spoke of many things that spoke of the inability for man to really save anybody that it would take the man Christ Jesus to do that but we see that Samson's life begins here in judges 13 in his life is a life that's anointed of God it's filled with the Spirit of God from the womb and God says you're gonna be an anointed vessel you're gonna be a consecrated vessel that Nazarite minute was a consecration it was it was it was something that would enable that that very human man to be very super human and God was gonna use this man's life but we know that the scripture says that his life is made up of one bad choice after the next bad choice after the next bad choice his life is born he's born under this Nazarite vow and god we know we could study the life of samson and we could highlight some of the victories because he had some in his life God had used him with for many good purposes and good victories in his life and the Bible only gives us certain specific details about the timeline of his life and when certain events happen but we know that there there must have been through Manoa and and they have this child and he's raised up as a deliverer and and and he's going to begin to deliver them from this oppression and the scripture says that you know that that that his life is built with the purpose in other words God had patterned her blueprinted the life of Samson God had charted a course for Samson it was his original intent or his original desire for to end up at a at a destination as the scripture says I know the plans you made for me and and that that I'll haven't expected in what the scripture saying there is that God charts the course of every life for a purpose he rose up Pharaoh for a purpose though it wasn't one that we ever want to fulfill but God raises up world leaders for purposes he rose up our life God had a pattern and a blueprint for your life and God's intent and his intention and his desire is to get you to come to that place of that pattern to where the purpose of God is fulfilled in your life but what we understand is is that though God had a pattern for Samson though he had a blueprint though he hadn't expected in yet Samson was a very real human being whose life was made up of memory his spirit was made up of a conscience of affections of reeds and reasonings and imaginations and within all of that human who's anointed and ordained with a destiny and with the blueprint and with a pattern yet there's something in the mix and it's called the power of free moral agency or the power of choice and so ultimately Samson could say God can save Samson I've destined you patterns your life I've charted your course but I'm gonna give you the choice Samson I'm gonna give you the choice of how you're gonna get there or if you will ultimately get there thank God he ultimately got there that God took his bad and made it good and we know the end of Samson's life where the scripture says he killed more destroyed more Philistines and his death and isn't as than in his entire life so God can take our permissive will and and get glory out of out of our mistakes and out of our faults and out of our failures God God we understand this by that there's a there's a truth to a predestination that we believe that there's a foreknowledge of God and that there's a predestinate that we believe our lives are predestinated but but what we have to understand is that God is still given each and every single one of us free moral agency and we ultimately choose how we're going to get to that destiny if you're an elected seat of God you couldn't take your name off no more than God could take your name off if your predestinated seat of God God will get his man God will get his woman God o get his seed but it'll be up to you as our pastor says so many times it's up to you whether you'll come there by your own choice or you'll come kicking and screaming but be assured God will get his man the Holy Spirit always gets his seed we find that very true and it played out perfectly in Samson's life he's born under this Nazarite vow oh the cost of a choice oh the cost of a choice and what a choice means it's amazing when we look at this something so small yet it can have such profound consequences as we said a Nazarite Valley it was something very special it was a spiritual vowel that you took to stay away from dead things and I want to be careful that I don't get a get too far ahead of myself here but I want to make sure that I don't miss this but Samson's life is is something here well let's just pick it up here as he follows choice bad choice after bad choice and Judges chapter 14 and your Bible if you'll turn there and at home also if you if you have a Bible there you could take that out but I want to just come to this and judges chapter 14 let's look at one of these bad choice amps and decides to make the scripture says in judges 14 verse 1 and Samson went down to Timnath saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Israelites now I'm glad you all have your Bibles you see Samson Hey he begins to get to this place in his life though filled with the spirit remember were preaching on the value of the Spirit here he is a place as an anointed vessel consecrated vessel has a Nazarite vow but the scripture says he goes down to Timnath and he saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines bad choice number one and then he the Bible says that he comes in with this with this arrogance and tells his dad and mother and verse two and said I've seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the daughters of the Philistines now therefore get her for me to wife what a demand he makes to his parents then his father and mother said in Amos there never a woman among he says said unto them as there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren among all thy people all my people that thou go is to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistine and Sampson said unto his father get her for me for she pleases me well it's amazing because God sets up this warning sign in Samson's life as God always gives us a warning before judgment and his mother and his father are going to be one of the first vessels of Mercy to Sampson though he doesn't recognize it though he recognizes it just as mom and dad yet little to Sampson know this is the first vessel of Mercy that is trying to get the attention of this wayward son and they say they immediately say Sampson huh you know here's a here is there not a daughter among our own people that you would have to go to the Philistines Samson is so determined he's so adamant he's gonna have this woman and and and we noticed it was it was such a rest such a bad choice such a bad decision yet even though God tried to warn him my brother my sister the Bible says there is no temptation that they can come upon you but with that temptation God makes a way of escape he brings a vessel of mercy in your life it may be a sermon it may be a prayer from a mother may be advice from parents it may be your friend it may be a feeling of the Holy Spirit come in your life it may be a voice or something but let me let me give you what the Bible says there we'll be a way of escape but it's up to you to take that way of escape what you don't see is that Samson doesn't respond to that mercy he responds to it by just barging over it it responds to him I just kicking it out of the way and moving it out of the way oh it's very different than Joseph who the Bible says when Joseph was confronted with Potiphar's wife he ran for his life he went the other direction what was it he was resisting the devil and the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you right but Samson the scripture says he just barrels right over the advice of his parents and says I'm going to take me a non message girl and and I'm gonna bring her in and I'm just gonna you know what they're gonna enter this work it'll work well let me give you the words of a prophet anything that's outside of God's line and order will fell every time I'm just gonna take her for my wife and I don't know I really can't figure out how it's gonna work I'm just gonna make it work you know it's amazing how quickly our desired human lust can cloud the vision and can cloud discernment of choice so many times were so clouded by our own desire Samson said she pleased with me well he was so clouded by this woman by a weakness you know because God had anointed Samson and God had given him and blueprinted his life but let me tell you something my brother my sister just as much as God had a plan for smurfer for Samson Satan also had a plan for Samson and just as much as God had given him strengths he also had human weaknesses and the devil studied those human weaknesses and the devil studies your human weaknesses and the devil knows what trips you up he knows what atmospheres where when you get in you have a pattern in your life to sort of go a certain direction and just as much as God had a plan for Samson Satan also had an intention and he wanted to make claim on Samson's life the scripture says he just barrels right over this decision and we're not gonna take the time here tonight but we know just the carnage that follows this choice absolute chaos follows this daughter of Timnath he's engaged to her and we know the story of the lion and he slays the line and then he goes back and sees the bees and the honey and he takes from the honey of those Beason touching a dead thing which was a Nazarite uh-uh what you absolutely can't can't do in a zoo right now you don't touch anything that's unclean or anything that's dead and then Samson comes back and we know the story of the riddle and then her brothers get involved and she's betrothed to another man and Samson ends up killing all of them this carnage and wreckage and and just go read it in Sandton judges chapter 14 it just turns into such a mess we don't have the time to preach all of this tonight but I'll just make a simple statement when you're when you refuse to take the way of escape God gives you in your life a mess we'll always follow the scripture says further he goes past this we know his life comes to here upon the story comes here let me just find my place here yes and chapter 15 turn to turn to Judges chapter 15 let's go one chapter over we got to get through this quick because we have a lot to get to and I got started a little bit late so give me mercy and give me grace I need it here tonight so notice this here and judges chapter 15 let me just find my place here make sure I get to the catch the right part of the story that I want to and notice what it says here in verse 10 and it says it says here and and and and the men of Judah said why are you come up against us and the answer to bind Samson are we come up to do to him as he has done to us so because he was such a conqueror because he would had so many Spears so much with this anointing of the Spirit that God had put it upon his life the Philistines just wanted to kill him they were gonna do anything they could to get after him and as we said they would become agents of the devil they would become anointed to afflict Samson to call Samson to lose his focus to call Samson to lose his passion for the Lord and his life comes to this decision and and Judges chapter 16 it says that then went Samson to Gaza and so their harlot and went in unto her and it was told the gale I gaze I saying Samson has come hither and they come past him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city they were quiet all the night saying in the morning when it's day we shall kill him and Samson lay till midnight and a rose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city the two posts and went away with him bar and all I remember preaching this years and years ago and I remember seeing this here in verse three and Samson lay till midnight I begin to just ponder that and try to put myself as I do many times reading these stories as I just pictured myself what was what was going through Samson's mind at this moment he's went in unto a harlot it's just a life of bad choice after bad decision after bad decision and alleys Timnath is over and that's in the past and all the wreckage and carnage not sure exactly what happened between then and now but now he finds himself going into a harlot and and and he's and the nights over and he's laying there and and and all the pleasures of the night are over and he's he's in he's laying in his bed no doubt you imagine as the scripture says he lay there till midnight now this man who who was anointed of God filled with the Spirit of God knew what it was like to operate the powers of God yet no doubt sometimes as we do many times at night we begin to take account for our life we begin to think of our choices the scripture says he lay there maybe maybe just a voice begin to speak to Samson and maybe something starting to try to break through his heart and trying to - to - to break that fallow ground of his mind the scripture says that I can't imagine what was going through Samson late till midnight can't imagine what was going through his mind maybe uh maybe there came some type of repentance I don't know maybe there came some kind of contrite us in Samson's heart as he began to just survey his life and the how am I here and lay just the winning it to a harlot and how did I find myself here Oh the fall and how great the fall was you as we do many times in our own life after we've made mistakes we begin to evaluate our decision their choices and the scripture says Samson lays to midnight when no miracle comes the strength of God comes upon him and he rips the gate in the bar put him on his shoulders and and he carries them up to the hill that's before had brawn and now at the moment of at the moment of repentance at the moment of God dealing with this heart and then God comes on the scene the Spirit alerts quicken to him and he rips the gates of the city and all of these men who were laying in wait notice the Bible says they waited they waited they were they were just going to stay there quietly all the while Samson had no clue there was always someone behind him over his shoulder waiting for the right moment to pounce waiting for the right moment for the weakness to come to such a place when his strength as when his secret is finally known Samson has no idea this he's just going through life he doesn't know that every time he's in a city there's a there's a special operations team that is trying to take him out you don't think the devil follows your life and follows my life and tries anything they can to scheme and to plant Satan is a planner he's a master planner he's a master strategist that's why the Apostle Paul says don't be ignorant of Satan's devices it was as devising his planning his scheming and Satan strategizes he watches your life he watches our life he makes in if he can if he can arrange certain circumstances to be in such a way as to as to as to attack you or to afflict you but no matter how great his repentance was there no matter how great that turning around was it must have not been very it must have not been very long because the scripture says here in verse 4 the very next verse and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman here's another woman in his life man just woman after a woman after a woman he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah you know it's amazing because he takes this Nazarite vow and what is the Nazarite this this Nazarite vow was someone in israel who takes a vow from birth to be separated so what it is it's a separation unto the lord Nazarites wouldn't drink they wouldn't partake of any wine or any alcohol because that represented human passion er or human lust they wouldn't come into contact with anything that was dead a dead person or a dead animal they stayed away from dead things which were because what does death represent to us spiritual death that's why we stay away from dead things that's my brother man and said anything without emotion is dead and ought to be buried we don't believe in dead singing we don't believe in dead music we don't believe in dead Christian lives were alive by the Spirit of God we stay away from dead things because God's not in death he's in life and so he was to stay away from anything that did that was there they wouldn't shave their head this was a consecration it was a sign of their commitment to the life this life of separation and separated them to the Lord they were but they get they were in the world don't forget this they weren't a monk they weren't living in a monastery and we're living in some other you know as some other desert place and they came out of the shadows Severine Islands they took a Nazarite vow yet they lived in a row around it among the rest of the world they were separated yet they were there with what are we were were in the world but we're not of the world it doesn't mean I notice this here they were in the world but they were not they were separated unto God for the purpose that he had in their life you take Samuel Samuel was a Nazarite unto God he was separated holy unto God John the Baptist was a Nazarite unto God he took a consecration he was separated unto God so so you say brother Matt what is this Nazarite is there still Nazarites today you spiritually by the Holy Spirit are a Nazarite unto God you are separated unto Jesus Christ o my brother my sister hope you catch you here tonight you are a Nazarite unto God God still has people who are separated unto God he still has an elected lady who is in the world but not of the world who doesn't touch dead things who doesn't partake of worldly things she's separated to God she sir life is separated unto God she's not gonna take partake of this world or this age of this world she's gonna keep her vow to the Lord you said no matter what does she get because of that she's full of the Spirit and the Spirit of God can use and operate through this Nazarite people can you say man they're separated unto God they've received the transforming power of the Lord Satan had a plan and his plan was to rob Samson of the strength and the power that enabled his life you know there's something that enables you to live a Christian life and it's definitely not you there's something that enables you to overcome the devil and it's definitely not you it's definitely not me it's not my intellect or my doctrine or how much I study it's the power and then the enabling of the Holy Spirit we ought to that's what I'm preaching to you here tonight you ought to value the Holy Spirit in your life to put a greater value upon the Spirit being able to flow and move and operate through you it's the only thing that will enable you to live a Christian life but Satan's plan is to rob you and to D to calls you to devalue the Spirit of God in your life and then Satan's plan was to robbing through this woman Delilah do you know what do you know what Delilah's name I wanted to put it on the board but I didn't have time to get it up I'm gonna give you the the meaning of Delilah her name simply means to slack off that's what the named Delilah means it means to slack off I almost like it means to ease up and I like the pedal when you're driving a car and then you come to something and you start to ease off the gas a little bit that's what it means they're literally her name means to ease up to total titute to ease up to lose intensity to lose your intensity as a Christian is one of the most dangerous things are more vulnerable to the attack of the devil in your life I'm not speaking to sinners here right now I'm speaking to you believers who are filled with the Holy Ghost you've got to keep your intensity for the Lord you've got to keep and keep the pedal to the metal don't let up don't ease off don't slack off it means Delilah means to lose your intensity and Samson had started off so intense so strong it was such vigor with such vibrancy with such such an anointing I had tried to live a separated life to judge Israel but now the Bible says through this through this slacking off or this easing off or this letting up in Samson's life do you know that there's 20 long 20 years in Samson's life to where we don't read if you look at the numbers of his when it tells us his age 20 years and the Bible doesn't record one act of strength through this man he loses his intensity at twenty it's an amazing number we're gonna find here in just a moment it's it represents something for twenty years that's long that's a long time twenty years is a long long time for 20 years we read of nothing of the Spirit of God moving upon Samson's life there are no victories there's no great battles that take place there's no exploits no victories over over the Philistines you know you can spend a long time in lukewarmness but you say brother Matt born again bored of the Spirit of God you could spend a long time with no intensity you could spend twenty long years eased up let off slacked off no more victories you say brother man how did this happen I can't I can't tell you that but it was Jack and tell you this it was the choice that Samson chose a very human choice he lost the value of the Spirit in his life it's one thing when you lose your intensity so I don't need all come on I don't need to be that intense for the Lord uh you know this separated life I got surely there's got to be some you know I don't know what it was I don't know what kind of flirting Samson did with the devil all I know is that the Bible says he laid in the lap and lost he laid in her lap and lost his intensity you want to know what will drain your intensity lay in the lap of Delilah similar Matt was the lap of Delilah worldly pleasures worldly lusts worldly things feed on that fourth dimension so much of Hollywood in the world and and all all the all the things of the world my brother my sister you'll lose your intensity same for the matter how do I keep my intensity keep feeding on the body word of the son of man keep those tapes rolling in your house read in that Bible keep playing that music keep singing those spiritual songs why brother Matt you're putting gasoline in your engine you're putting fire the dynamic fire of the Holy Ghost in your heart I say God give me more intensity made me more zealous for yo God again don't let me let up or slack off let me push the pedal to the metal he loses his intensity he goes down to this woman in the valley of Sorek it's Philistine territory the scripture says he finds this prostitute Delilah and he and he spends the night with her we know the story the next morning Samson realizes that you know did what had happened to him and we know the story of where they come in and there's Liars and wait we don't want to take the time here in a Wednesday night but there's Liars and wait waiting to afflict him attack him and the scripture says Samson wakes up and brokest broke the the the you know the the cords that were that he was wrapped in and he and he realizes his mistake but yet his strength is still there and he says he should the Bible says he shook himself and he and he slew the Philistines that were there to kill him we know the story then the next night goes and she does the same thing all Samson all tell me where in my great strength lies and he makes up something all of you if you braid my hair and weave it is with a Weaver's beam that has never been you know dried and all this you know then I'll be has become as any other man and he falls asleep on her lap and she does it she weaves his hair and then she tells the people that are coming you know that we're laying him wait he's asleep and then they come in and she says Samson the Philistines be upon thee and the scripture record Samson broke the web and he broke that broke old all the things that she had put on him to bind him and he slew the Philistines I guess what he does the very next night he goes back in the night back in the lap of Delilah goings back to the same thing you think it was surely it would have called his attention surely he would have woke up at some point goes the next night turned that the next thing ties him Bank binds him with vines Samson the Philistines be upon thee he wakes up to repeats it does the same exact thing rinse and repeat rinse and repeat rinse and repeat going down the same pattern in the same pattern the same pattern you know what though the problem is is that with each time he loses more value of the Spirit with each time that voice of warning that voice of judgment that voice of a Samson the Philistines be upon that you don't no doubt it shook he know about it no doubt he came to himself you know like when you're woken up in the middle of the night by something you suddenly come awake you're wide awake no doubt it shook him the first time but you know every time if you hear that every single night over and over and over again that that doesn't doesn't shake you the same way it did before it doesn't alert you does it shock you the same way because it happened the night before and then and then and then it gets quieter and every time you you you you refuse the voice of the Lord for your life trying to warn your vessel of mercy that voice gets quieter and I think it's quieter Samson the Philistines be upon thee and it doesn't do anything doesn't move you then the next time Samson until before long it's why do you do that because I'm trying to illustrate to you here today that the voice of the Lord when it comes in correction is bright and loud and bursting through to your to you to your spirit but if you the Bible says the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man and so eventually that voice gets quieter and gets quieter and gets quieter and that voice of quick-cook conviction gets quieter and you get more used to doing the same thing over and over again no doubt Samson here is just beginning to be more load to sleep and more load to sleep and more load to sleep oh just a little bit you know just just dabble in it just a little bit you begin to flirt with it you play with fire you get burnt and he continues to go down this way and then Felicity's urged he'll notice this here they begin to urge him the entire time the Devils working behind the scenes the entire time the Philistines are waiting waiting to destroy him Oh is scheming always planning and they urged him to Lila entice him find out a secret find out his power that we may prevail against him we won't admit what was it they be what they wanted to take this man captive they wanted to bind him that's exactly what the devil wants to do to your life he wants to wrap you up and wrap you up and with it's a job he'll wrap you up if it's a career he'll wrap you up if it's a passion he'll wrap you up I don't care how harmless or seemingly innocent it seems what the devil get a hold of him he'll begin to wrap you up like a spider does interweb wrap him up and wrap him up and tell us you know let me say this D my brother my sister the tragedy of the life of Samson wasn't his his adulterous affair it wasn't it wasn't that he laid with the harlot the tragedy of Samson was not a shaven hair you read the story and she eventually eventually gives a secret and she shaves him hello it's so tragic my brother my sister you missed the tragedy the tragedy was not the sin the tragedy is this is a man who was an anointed a vessel of God that had lost the value of the Holy Spirit in his life the tragedy is that it suddenly didn't mean what it used to mean and it didn't mean I know this is a simple message here for Wednesday night but I just what the Lord placed upon his heart and then that somehow he had did that too he allowed the devil to devalue the things of God in his life the presence of God was no longer the most important thing in his life say that's the tragedy that's the tragedy of Sam's Oh Sampson woke up that morning hair had been shaved off shaven completely and the scripture says it this way says Sampson said I'll go out as other times as before and I'll shake myself and he was not he knew not that the Spirit of the Lord had departed and then he goes you know what happens after that bondage they take him captive put out his eyes take him captive Oh put out his eyes where he couldn't see they bind him with fetters of brass and brother branham said brass represents a judgment but let me say this to you Sampson was blind long before they poked his eyes out Sampson was bound with fetters of brass long before they put chains around him his life was so entangled and oh he gets to such a place in his life I want to look here at Jacob before we close here just give me about 15 more minutes gonna go just a little bit longer than we would typically but we don't have a group here gathering for prayer so just give me grace here tonight I want you to turn to Genesis if you could Genesis chapter 28 just turn there quickly if you could if you could Genesis chapter 28 and verse 15 I want you to just look at this here this man is life of Jacob the Bible says here in Genesis chapter 28 and behold verse 15 I am with thee notice this is the promise to this man I preached along some of these lines here before in the past but the Lord has just brought this all fresh to me again so I want to look at this here he says and behold I am with thee this is the Lord to Jacob behold I am with thee and I will keep thee in all the places whether thou goest and I will bring thee again to this land for I will not leave the until I have done that which I have spoken to thee off notice the promise here's the promise to Jacob behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all the places choices decisions crossroads junctions all the spots of life no matter God makes a promise to Jacob and says the matter where you go Jacob it's almost just like jesus promised he said I'll never forgive you and I'll never forsake you doesn't say that you won't leave the Lord it doesn't say you can't forsake the Lord that you can't become unfaithful to the Lord all my brother my sister we all can get to places in our life to where we have failed the Lord can we be honest here tonight we can all get to places like Samson where we've made bad choices and made bad decisions but God makes a promise I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll never walk away from you I'll never get discouraged you may get discouraged but I'll never get discouraged in you I'm never gonna quit on you I'm never gonna stop loving you I'm gonna bring you to the place that I have promised Oh didn't God say I think it's in the Book of Isaiah God says can't a woman forget her suckling babe and he says yay they may forget but I can never forget you that's what God says here he says I behold I will never forget you God says because I've graven you in the palms of my hands Jesus was going to fulfill that literally one day on Calvary and he was going to engrave you in the palm of his hands what does it promise what does it signify he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me oh you should say a man and rejoice to that no matter where I go he'll go no matter what I do he won't stop no matter what I say well no matter no matter what place God says I'll never forget you a woman may forget her suckling baby but I'll never forget you I'll never leaves you I'll never forsake you he says he says behold I have graven you upon the palms of my hands you know something amazing right after that in Isaiah he says thy walls are continually let's look it up brother brother Joe if you could Isaiah chapter 49 let's look at this here in Isaiah 49 before we turn this corner Isaiah 49 verse 14 notice what he says here if you could just pull it up brother Joe Isaiah chapter 49 verse 14 let's just begin reading messiaen said the Lord has forsaken me my Lord has forgotten me honey anybody ever said that before and maybe you didn't say it with your mouth maybe you didn't say it out loud but how many times just be honest here just be honest how many times have you thought that in your mind lord have you forsaken me lord have you have you forgotten me what you know sometimes we can look at things in our life and go what's happening Lord what's going on Lord what are you doin Lord hi have you forgotten me no design says eight Lord has forgotten me here's God's reply verse fifteen can a woman he asked a question can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb all of us here tonight would say no no way a woman a mother forget her baby God says I know you think that's may seem pas seemed impossible but as impossible as you think it is for a mother to forget her baby oh my brother I hope you catch it tonight look at the example the Lord uses there's nothing like a mother's love for a baby and says can a woman forget her baby costas oh I'm just going to go ahead and you may say it's point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one that a woman can ever forget her baby John says out of this I'll say yay they may forget but here's what I'm gonna say they may forget yet will I not forget the alleluia he says I never forgot forget I will not forget thee verse sixteen brother Joe behold I have grave and V I have inscribed thee that word graven means to take a pin there to take a to take a chisel and to chisel you to chisel your name and he says I have graven you in the palms of my hands every time I look at my hand I'm looking at you i have graven you in the palm of my hands then he says thy walls are continually before me thy walls are continually before me what is God saying as I walls I've graven you in the palm of my hand this word is Choma in the Greek this is in the Hebrew listen what it means it means to be joined or to be connected or to be attached this is what God is saying here it means to be joined to a wall or attached to a wall it's the same as a stonemason would interlock a brick to a brick and that's how that's how masons know when they take brick and they're gonna build a wall they lay one brick and they attach it to the next then they attach it to the next and they attach it to the next and they attach it to the next this is what God is saying I'll never forget you I'll never leave you I've joined myself to you I've attached myself to you you're one brick I'm the other brick you're one brick on the other brick I'm so intrinsically connected to you how could I forget you Oh God is saying you may for you let me get let me make sure this is clear in your mind you may give up on me but I'm never gonna give up on you I'm gonna keep preaching the Word of God to you I'm gonna keep encouraging you I'm gonna keep lifting you up I'll never forget you your walls are continually before me your I am joined to your wall now I want you to think of that and I want you to listen again to Genesis chapter 28 brother Joe listen to this promise he makes Jacob verse 15 of Genesis chapter 28 yeah y'all right tonight notice verse 15 and behold Genesis chapter 28 verse 15 I'll wait for him to get it up verse 15 you're alright verse 15 Genesis chapter 28 notice when he tells Jacob and behold I am with thee and will keep thee what did that with thee mean means I'm joined to you Jacob I will keep thee in all the places where there thou goest and Jacob history the Bible is gonna record that you're gonna go a lot of places that God never told you to go you're gonna you're gonna err you're gonna backslide from Bethel you're gonna backslide from this place of an altar he says but no matter where you go Jacob and you're gonna go a lot of places I never anointed you to go but I'm gonna go to Jacob because I'm connected to you I'm joined to you he says I'll be with thee and notice he says Jacob woke out of a sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place that man and he says then I knew it not and he was afraid and said how dreadful means awesome his aids in this plays this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven Jacob rose up early and took the stone that he had put for his pillows set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it and he called the name of that place Bethel Bethel means the house of God but the name of the city was called lose at the first and Jacob vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and we'll give me bread to eat and rained and put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my god but Jacob you didn't but Jacob you didn't stay Lord was with you but the Bible says Jacob notice this experience the spiritual experience he has the Bible says he calls this place Bethel oh what a vivid what it what a dream this man must have had at night so vivid is this dream that the Bible says he wakes up the next morning and he takes a stone and he takes oil and he's just got to do something the experience was so awesome he he listens I gotta gotta do something here this was so powerful of an experience I'm gonna I'm gonna pour oil anointing oil upon it I'm gonna set it up as a sacred stone or a sacred memorial I'm gonna call it Bethel it means the house of God what was he signifying and experience with the Spirit of God it meant something to him oh my brother my sister I can just preach right here and say the day the Lord saved me and got a hold of my life it meant something to me oh it's a special spot you should have a special place and remembrance in your mind say God you got a hold of my life you turned me around you changed my desires oh it's a memorial it's worthy of something special it's not just a common place it's a it's a it's a special place it's what they would do it's a common in the Eastern culture they would take graves and they would they would memorialize them and build shrines out of it spoke of something special it was a special place a marker it was I was a sad was a bay was a memorial it served as something that typify door represented as special experience a significance had taken place in Jacob's life oh it was a it was a reminder of this spiritual experience he had he pours the oil on the top of the Stoney's he's declaring he says Lord I'm gonna serve you as long as you'll be with me bringing me back to my father's place oh oh he gives he gives such a he gives such such a it's such an experience here but notice how disobedient this may not well I don't have the time here on Wednesday I'm just gonna have to just skip over pages of notes here just to come to what I believe the Lord wants me to and that's okay notice how disobedient Jacob becomes in his life we know the story of Jacob his name means shyster supplanter oh he just lives his entire life he sees running from God the tire life he's running for the purpose of God and and and in a struggle and he says a struggle within himself become so disobedient and though he's an anointed servant of God though God visits him in such a special way he's an anointed seasoned and anointed servant just like Samson was an anointed vessel of God God appears the helmet Bethel he appears them at this special place the significance to his mind supernaturally the Lord visits him in a dream and he sees a ladder reaching from heaven to earth and the angels of God descended and aseneth upon that ladder sees the Lord and and God says Jacob I'm with you no matter where you go I'll always be with you Jacob wherever thou goest and I will bring you back until I've accomplished my purpose in your life I'll bring you back to this place Jacob II gives him a promise I've joined myself to you I've attached myself to you I'm connected to you Jacob I'll not leave thee until I've done that which I've spoken to thee God wasn't joining he was connecting and God says I'm never gonna lose much I'm never gonna lose my focus you're gonna lose yours many times but God will never lose his focus on what he wants to do in your life God will never lose his purpose how quickly we can become so lose our focus we have ambition our gonna be so I'm gonna do this for the Lord we lose our focus God says I'm not lose my focus no matter what you do it's not gonna uh dissuade me from keeping my promise in your life it's sure it's solid it's firm I've made a plan I've made a blueprint I've charted your life I'm gonna get you there Jacob I'm not gonna leave you I'm not gonna forsake you no matter how backslidden you become in your life I'm gonna get a hold of you Jacob I'm Anne I'm attaching myself to you and Jacob wakes ups Lord is in this place and the Bible says all he says how dreadful is this place none other than by the house of God and it's amazing from that moment 20 long years just like Samson no 20 years from that experience 20 years following such a wonderful experience yet those twenty years are trial and sorrow and struggle know what it is Jacob's wrestling Jacob long before he wrestles with the Lord he's wrestling with himself and many people get to this place to where they've not won that Lord hasn't won the battle yet and they're wrestling with himself they become angry in this wrestling they become bitter Jacob was angry wasn't a person you want to be around Esau was he's always a good man Jacob wasn't a very good man but you know what the difference was Jacob was a god man he had a favor upon his life and sometimes people that are a god man has favored maybe aren't necessarily a good man but there's a good purpose in their life Jacob struggles any troubles and he trials and sorrows and he's running and he's wrestling I wish we had the time to go into some of these but we don't let's just move on Jacob settles down he leaves Bethel and he comes to this place although he had an experience in his life though that glory of that first night with the Lord and all of the splendor and and how significant it was he becomes he becomes so distant from the Lord and becomes so far away as judgments clouded his decision makings clouded and then God speaks to him again Genesis chapter 31 brother Joe now I want you to notice listen very close listen to what the Lord says to Jacob backslidden Jacob lustful Jacob we don't have the time to highlight it you think you're being bad on brother Jacob will you go read Genesis 28 29 and 30 I'm doing I'm just giving you the I'm not even mentioning some of the lowlights just remember this is a backslidden cold lukewarm man and here's the Word of God to that backslidden man Genesis chapter 31 verse 13 brother Joe notice what God God speaks to Jacob and says I am the God of Bethel I'm not the God of your backslidden I'm not the God of your lukewarmness I'm not the God of of your of your letting off and slacking off and losing intensity I'm the God of Bethel Jacob here's my word unto you I'm the God of your first experience Jacob where notice where thou anointest the pillar God noticed it he says where thou anointest where they'll vowed a vow remember all the Mao Jay can remember what you promised I'm that God Jacob I'm the God of Bethel Jacob what's God doing it's a vessel of mercy it's mercy saying Jacob turn around man turn your life around what are you doing Jacob I'm the God back there what are we doing here because remember God didn't leave Jacob God stood right beside him I'm going to a wall I'm staying right here but I'm gonna give you the voice of the Lord I'm the God of Bethel Jacob now arise get thee out of this land and return into the land of thy kindred this was God said remember Jacob remember how I dealt with you remember that dream remember how vivid remember how I spoke to you remember your promise Jacob remember your vow that you made unto me Jacob remember the alter J can remember your first experience and go back to that Jacob go back to that place he's Savin surely for the mat that's what Jacob did genesis chapter 33 notices here I want you to turn there Genesis chapter 33 brother Joe just verse 1 if you want to bring it up that'd be fine Genesis chapter 33 notice what Jacob does here Jacob the scripture says that he dwells instead let me let me come to this here and in verse and verse 18 and Jacob came to Shalem a city and Shechem which is in the land of Canaan Canaan way Jacob God just told you to go back to Bethel and this is your reply instead of obeying the voice of God he goes to Shechem scripture says he brought a he bought any and he bought a parcel notice and he bought a parcel of a field where he spread his tent at the hand of the children hey Marsh check his father for a hundred what are you doing you're not only gonna go there you're not just visiting Jacob don't try to tell me you're just visiting you're planning don't live in there you just heard the voice of the Lord and you're gonna build you're gonna build a house you're gonna buy a land you're gonna you're gonna plant roots here and God has already told you Jacob what are you doing oh god it's just temporary just for a little while if it's gonna be over I'll get back to you I'll get back to the purpose of God in my life I'll get there one day all young people say the same thing oh one day I'll serve the Lord God not right now I need this in my life Lord one day I'll serve you one day I'll turn my life to you I'm not doing it permanently Lord yeah but you're building the house you're planting roots you're buying a field gee this is what the Bible says today is the day of salvation not tomorrow you may not have a tomorrow but the scripture says he goes and he dwells and Shechem you know what Shechem means chicca means to go back not to go back to Bethel but to backslide it means a place of burdens oh you're gonna find out how true that was brother Jacob some place of burdens any time any time you're out of the will of God and you've disobeyed the voice of the Lord huh you find yourself in a place of burdens he's gonna get into trouble we know the story in Genesis chapter the next chapter over Genesis chapter 34 brother Joe verse 1 very first thing that happens here Dina the daughter of Leah she born to Jacob went out to see the daughters of the land what do you think you're you're going your children are gonna do what do you expect your children to do when you put them and all they live in the world you you put the world you're not living in the house of God you're not living in the presence of God you're not living with the token applied you're living with the world you're living with Hollywood you're putting the world always in front of them what do you expect them to do they're gonna see the daughters of the land notice what it says here she went out to see the daughters of the land verse 2 brother Joe and when Shechem the son of Haymore the hive a prince of the country sorry took her lay with her and defiled her this is the daughter of Jacob what a horrible burden he's gonna have to live with now we don't want to get into some of this but I just want you to realize because he disobeyed the voice of the Lord he's now going to live a life with burdens that scar will never leave his family remember at the beginning of the sermon we told you about the power of choice and how every choice has a consequence what a price to pay his daughters raped his house is defiled and you read the rest of the story what his brother his own sons had to go to do to get her back just to get her back and then that the story just unravels and unravels and unravels what a horrible burden Jacob has to bear do you think Jacob ever one time said you know maybe I'm out of the will of God it's amazing how our life gets so untangled we look at the mess of our life we blame the pastor we blame the preacher we blame our parents we blame the situation we blame our health we blame our job we blame we blame everybody but we never we never what do they call that interest on that when you when you look inwardly introspect you you have no introspective looking at your life there's a there's no there's no inward looking to say maybe it might have been my choices that I made you know what we would have done if we had Jacob if we were God we would have said Jacob you're getting what you deserved you didn't listen to God look at what mess you've made Oh Jacob you ought to be ashamed of yourself how differently a true father handles his children how differently God do you know that not one single word that I can find in the Bible God speaks to Jacob begin but do you know that God never mentions it one time never brings it up Jacob knew what he did wrong Jacob understood God never mentions it once he doesn't he not not one single word not a word about the murder that he did that his sons committed not not a murder about the pollution of his dog the uncleanliness and the the rape not no no nothing no guilt trip no no condemnation instead God comes to Jacob and he says in verse 3

doctor visited CT scan came back she has fluid on the lungs nodules in her lungs the mass on one of her breasts doctor had my wife take her to the ER to start having all three issues checked and they wouldn't even let her come in the ER waiting room with her this is an update says they did admit her late last night and started running multiple tests this morning to try and determine what is causing all of this might be a day or two before they get the initial tests back none of us are allowed to stay with her or visit her currently due to everything going on with the quarantine apparently they are only allowing family in for near death cases or those who are completely unable to take care of themselves she's in good spirits considering and told us she's not alone because Jesus is there with her thank you amen praise the Lord for that thank you for your prayers also a request from Ezra for the brad's family relation a relative brother Brad I'm guessing here for the five month old baby Ezra appointment with GI went okay but we don't have enough answers yet Ezra got a new x-ray that the doc wasn't prepped wasn't impressed with so he's having to test on Monday they were apparently they were apparently way too many air pockets or there were apparently way too many air pockets so he's having us a sweat test to rule out cystic fibrosis and an upper GI which he can't eat for eight hours before before that so it's going to be very rough depending on what is found in those tests he will then be getting an endoscopy he barely gained from his appoint he barely gained from his appointment three weeks ago and he had just eaten so some of that was food transfer so hopefully Monday they will break grill answers we'll remember that little five month old baby
