========================================

[Music] [Music] like to just teach this morning take a few scriptures and i'd like to teach uh this morning on what is the church amen what is the church and i'd like to just begin here with matthew 16 a very familiar passage and uh i think that it's um i think it's a keynote scripture for us for what we believe and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it you can be seated this morning jesus said unto peter i will build my church so one thing that we could establish right here from matthew chapter 16 that i think is a very important distinction uh because the church has been defined by many through many ages and church leaders and church bishops and theologians of what the church is and today we have an entire church system that is based around salvation it's based around repentance and those are all true things and definitely things that are part of the church but what jesus said he was coming to do was more than to save people right and a lot of times we define what jesus came to do when he came into the earth as he was coming to save individuals but actually he was he wasn't coming to save individuals he was coming to build a church now it would include salvation it'd include redemption it'd include repentance baptism but he didn't just come to save individuals he came to do what he said and that is i will build my church and so what we what we know first is that a church is not a building and you may point to a building uh today and say i go to that church you may you may drive with someone down mossy oak road and say there's my church but you know we could say that's the church that i go to but actually that's not the church that you go to that's not the church at all this is just a building and uh and it's a it's a it's a building made by men and it houses us it puts us in a place with a an a spot where we can identify a place of assembly where we all meet this is where we all meet it's our meeting house but this house could change tomorrow it could change there's nothing at all holy about the building physically now it's not as we've said many times before it's nothing to do with the pews or or the music that we play or the the scent uh a fragrance that we use that makes a building holy it's not even um it's not even any part of any any mechanical function that we do but what makes it holy is who dwells here and that's jesus christ that's what makes it holy as far as the building goes this building could be we could sell it and they could use it for a strip club they could use it for you know a nightclub they could use it for a bar then what happens to the building the building was always just a building it's a place of assembly and so as we said a chur the church is not a building and and and and that we point to and say that's the church that i go to but the church is the people that's the church and whether it meets in a building whether they meet in a tent or whether they meet outside in the open air it's still the church brother branham says and i didn't have time to put these on the screen so you'll just have to listen close brother branham says here and why we are not of the nomination but did you ever notice that every time a church ever fails as soon as they denominate they start failing right then and whenever they fail god never raises that church again so what is the what is the sure method to killing a church denomination and denomination we know is not is not uh you don't ever find a nomination in the bible you find that men made they did not the word denominate means to separate means to self-identify and so they've named it many different denominations that they've that they've given it but that's not that's not the church the church is the is the body of jesus christ brother adam says here in the same message he says god deals with because when we think of a church we think of a collection of people and it is but you have to be careful how you look at a group and uh uh and and and the difference between a group and an in an individual to god means a lot right brother baron would go on to say that the way that god dealt with israel was as a group he dealt with him as a nation but he said the way that he deals with the new testament church is individuals so he said brother matt does that mean god doesn't have a group no it's not what it means at all but it's how he builds that group or establishes that group is he comes to individual hearts brother adam says god deals with individuals not with the nomination god in no age ever dealt with the denomination he's always dealt with an individual in the old testament brother adam begins to give this type here that in the old covenant he dealt with a nation a group but today he's dealing in the hearts of people so we can't emphasize this one point enough there is no safety in numbers there's no safety in putting your name on a book that doesn't make you a member there's no safety in the family natural human family that you're part of there there is a lot you see brother matt there's a lot there's a lot of safeties i'm just talking about salvation as far as your eternal soul brother and says here in the same message he says i said in the in the infallibility of the catholic church why has it changed so much he said well see you all believe the bible we believe the church this is a catholic person speaking to him we don't care what the bible says it's what the church says that's exactly right you ever come brother adam says you ever come to a showdown try it once see they don't care what the bible says that has nothing to do with it they care what the church says we don't care what the church says we believe what brother adam says but we don't care what the church says we believe what god says for the bible says let every man's word be a lie and mind be the truth and then he says that's why we're not a denomination amen so in order to find out what is the church very simple teaching here this morning we need to define what the church is not what it's clearly not what it's absolutely not what it's in no way shape or form what the church is not is the church is not a business so many churches today are ran like a modern business and and you can run a business good and there's good practices good biblical practices on how to run a business but the church is not a business and some churches copy even if even to the very foundation of of how business pro of how a worldly business runs itself a church will take those same models and principles and and build it the same exact way even even church projects when they go to do a new church project you ran it now i could say of course a church has to be ran in some ways like its finance has to be ran properly and it has to have good practices and there's and there's definitely business matters that a church responsibilities business matters that a church takes uh part in and has to there's some things that a church has to involve themselves in just to be able to function uh you know we have to we have to abide by certain municipality rules and regulations here how we run so in some ways we're governed by those things but we don't we understand that the church that jesus said in matthew 16 i'll build my church he wasn't building the business it wasn't about getting rich it wasn't about money at all it was about souls right so it it it shouldn't be because the here's why i said brother matt why because the church is not an organization right the church is not in no way an organization it's not an organization it's an organism that was a good point that was one of my power points the church is not an organization it's an organism meaning that it's it's a living body it's not a dead building it's not a dead group of of of elders and trustees and deacons and pastors and that's not what it is it's not a group of men it's not an organization that we've organized it's an organism the church that jesus said he was coming to build was something that lived right the church is also not a club it's not a club and i'm talking about like a nightclub i'm talking about a club like uh yeah exactly like it's not it's not it's not a group it's not a local chapter or a club that and you can join those you know they have veterans clubs and veterans will join them and they'll find camaraderie with with the club it's not it's not you say well then it's a religious club no it's a lot of a lot of churches have made it a religious club and people join it like they join a religious club but the church that jesus is referring to is not a religious club at all so so many and and people joined churches today and you do you hear that well you know we went and i was at a church just recently it was a big baptist church and they had a they had a wooden board and that said members and it literally had a numeric number for how many members uh were in the church and that's how they that's how they view church and it was like you joined a club in a club you pay your yearly dues you join it you join the club you pay your yearly dues you have your membership subscription and and you you attend all the business meetings you vote and your vote means something you have a roll call you have a roll call at clubs make sure you're there make sure your vote counts but let me just say this that's not a church and a church shouldn't think like that we don't want the will of men voting we want the will of god we want what god wants uh what else the church is not the church is not a club the church is not a business the church is not the clergy this is a really important one right here the church is not the clergy it's not the leadership oh what is the church well it's it's the it's the preachers no no it's not it's amazing how many people view the church and when they think of the church they think of the clergy or the ministry and the catholic churches went really heavy in that what is the church it's the the you know the palpacy it's the pope then from there it's the bishops and the arch archbishops and they think of the entire structure of the churches by um the the saying the old saiyan is the sage on the stage but that's not the church the church and people say oh boy you know the the uh you know the the ch you know that you have the famous state boy the church ought to do something about that people love to say that you know that in our day it's the you know the preachers boy the preachers ought to do something about that thank god for preachers thank god for preachers who preach the truth thank god for pastors who preach the truth and rightly divide uh the word but oftentimes when people say the church ought to do something they're saying you preachers ought to do something we're paying our ties aren't we thank god for preachers but god's looking for the manifestation of the sons and the daughters of god the whole body can you say amen and it's and it's and and so many times we wait everything's being we're waiting for someone out here waiting for something out here to happen but but it's i just let me say this it's time for believers to come to their position and stop waiting for some future thing to happen god is moving in his church right now i said this last wednesday that i preached god is moving whether you feel him or not god is speaking right now whether you hear him whether i hear him or not god's speaking i say lord let me hear you so the church is not a building it's not an organization it's not a business it's not a club it's not the clergy say then what is it brother matt you've noted you've labeled all the things that it's not well let's let's find out what it what the bible calls the church one of the first things that the bible calls the church is a family got your attention hebrews chapter 2 turned there in your bible use your bible if you have it if you don't we'll have it on the screen hebrews chapter 2. let's start reading the verse 10. hebrews 2 nothing don't have a screen that's all right so good we got we got the wrestling of the leaves people's bibles turning hebrews chapter 2 verse 10 for it became him for whom all for whom are all things and by whom are all things listen to this bringing many sons to glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through their through sufferings notice verse 11 for both he that sanctifieth and those and they who are sanctified are all one for which calls he is not ashamed to be called to call them brethren saying i would declare thy name unto thy brethren in the midst of the church while i sing praises unto thee so what is the bible we could read we could we could read five or six scriptures on this but just to save time the bible calls the church a family and it's literally you say what family the family of jesus christ that's what family name we have the whole family in heaven the bible says is named after him jesus christ that's the whole which the whole family is named so it's it's it's really the true family it's really what family really is the world modern world today has defined family what family is and a lot of times we get our influences of what family is not from the scripture but from hollywood what a perversion what a perversion but a real family the real family is the family of jesus christ can you say amen this morning you know um another description we could we could spend time on that it's a family it's it's a it's a real family you have unity in a family of harmony in a family another description the bible gives the church is a flock and the bible calls it this it's a flock you turn to hebrews chapter 13 very important scripture hebrews chapter 13 verse 17 hebrews 13 or 17 it says obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give an account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so it says submit yourself for the speaking of pastors here speaking of leaders those that have the rule over you submit yourself for they watch over your soul so the bible all through the scriptures through the gospels and through the through the apostle paul's writings all the way through the new testament it identifies the church as a flock and and and quite literally in that way we are a flock of sheep we're a flock of sheep that's what the bible types us as that we're we're we're a flock of sheep and sheep are under under a shepherd and they're they're and and that shepherd's under the good shepherd but we're we're sheep and you know sheep have a tendency to get out of line they they it's in their natural it's it's part of their makeup they get out of order they they don't i shift you i'm talking naturally here about the animal it doesn't stay it doesn't just automatically stay in a group or stay in line it has a has its own has wants to have its own mind and its own way and and the bible says we like sheep have all gone astray and so it's part of our makeup that we go astray and so so it takes a shepherd amen and that's why you have a pastor that's why you have the preaching of the word of god to keep you on track to guide you safely can you say amen uh you watch a shepherd uh today and and and i was just hearing a man earlier this morning hearing a a a uh person describe a shepherd the role of a shepherd and sheep and it was amazing because he talked about the differences he said if you look at modern if you look at uh and you know even in our nation in north america at shepherd and he said it's very different than how if you go today to the middle east and you watch a shepherd with sheep and he said it's so so very different he said you know today they it's it's it's uh uh you know and he was giving the description hell in north america how that they uh a shepherd treats a sheep and he uses sheep dogs and he takes dogs to herd the sheep and to move the sheep he says but over in the middle east he said there's they don't have they don't use sheepdogs he says that the shepherd is the dog he's the one who's hurting he's the one who's calling he's the one who's keeping in the little in in order any any and he says and he has a um and he says he has a crook and that crook that is a is a tool it's like a long beam with a hook at the end and he says that's for pulling the sheet back to grab them by the neck and he says to pull them back in order when they get out of order and he says you know the think of david the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me and and so he's he leadeth me he maketh me it's it's the shepherd doing everything not an animal not a dog uh like over here but it's the shepherd himself and he and he says and he says he has two tools he has a crook and he says that's to pull the sheep back in line and he also has a dagger and he says that's to wilt off uh the enemy the wild beasts the animals and he says that's the two tools of the shepherd he's always pulling in order and he's always defending i thought it was a beautiful type of what a shepherd is because jesus says i am the good shepherd i lay my life down for the sheep and brother branham typed that and he says jesus says i am the door of the sheepfold and brother branham says i never understood what that meant i'm the door of the sheepfold and he says till i went over there in the middle east and he said i seen the shepherd and he would take all the sheep and he'd gather them into the pin and he says then there was no door there's just a pin open and he says and then the shepherd laid down and he went to sleep and he literally was the door in other words nothing was going to come in unless he let it in nothing was going to go out unless he let it out and jesus says i'm the door to the sheepfold i leave i lay my lifetail the the church is also a fellowship the bible speaks of this in john 1 first john 1 really familiar scripture and it's this is this is uh this is a word that the bible uses very differently than how what we call fellowship we think of fellowship today if you've in in any church um you know we we we like to say let's have fellowship and you know we we announced this morning that the fellowship polls open um so free free announcement the fellowship was open um but it's we think a fellowship as we're going to go in the fellowship paul and we're going to have you know have coffee and you don't like coffee you're going to have tea and uh and you know we think of that that's that that's fellowship you know what's interesting is that you never you never say to one of your business associates hey let's go have fellowship you never say to one of your friends you know hey let's have some felt you know you only say that when it's the church right at least i hope that's all you use it for you know you don't say to a person you're trying to sell a you know uh hey let me have product let me have fellowship on this product with you what do you mean fellowship so when we and and sometimes we we use a word so much it becomes common to us and i thought it was so amazing i was astounded by this this morning let's look at first john chapter one verse three jesus and notice i want you to yeah good we have it on the screen that's perfect first john 1 it says that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with the son jesus christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is lighter than him when there's no darkness at all if we say we have fellowship coffee tea you know snacks no that's not what it's talking about at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin kanona i think i'm pronouncing that right is the greek word that the bible uses here when it speaks of fellowship and it uses it and and more than first john you could you we could we could uh speak about the fellowship of his sufferings we could uh you know uh we there's many scriptures that speak of this word kanoina it's translated you you find it in in acts chapter 2 verse 42. you don't have to turn and you'll remember this scripture when i quote it and they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship and to the breaking of bread and prayer speaking of the new testament church canoina and so that same word and it's so amazing how very different the word fellowship is used in the bible than how we have commonly used fellowship as you know the the you know the funny thing it's two fellows in the ship all of that's good all of that's great you know we get together we have fellowship but what is real fellowship you know it's actually used for siamese twins kanoona siamese twins have conoyna because twins and i want you to think of this when you think when the bible says we have fellowship one with another what's it saying we have kanoina one with another we have something in common that's what it's that's what it means when it says we have fellowship we have something in common you may have nothing in common we may sit outside here and we may fellowship and we find out we have nothing in common you like golfing i don't i like hunting you don't like hunting you know you like sweet tea and i don't i like unsweet tea we may have nothing in common but we have one thing in common when we start talking about the word of god then we have fellowship and it doesn't mean we have conversation it doesn't mean we have dialogue it means we have something in common think of the church as it was established from all parts of the jews and the gentiles and samaritan all of the entire world they were so very different but yet god was going to give them fellowship by what the holy spirit amen and through the holy ghost there would be canona so awesome when you think of this because it's used for siamese twins you know what a siamese twin is those that are joined together at birth now think of this when you think of fellowship one with another what fellowship do we have with each other why are we here gathered in the building together what is fellowship a siamese twin has kanoina because they're born a siamese twin is joined together at birth they share the same bloodstream a lot of times they share the same organs notice this is what it means when it says we're part of a fellowship it's not drinking coffee it's that we have something one in common one with the other we're sharing something together we're sharing life together they share the same organs sometimes in fact um one of the most difficult surgeries that can that you that can take place one of the most difficult surgeries is to separate a siamese twin to separate them sometimes it can't be done sometimes it's impossible because of what all they share so the bible says that we have fellowship we have what is a church don't forget my topic here what is the church it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a fellowship and it means it has canon it has something in common it shares the bible says that we have canonif we have fellowship in the spirit that because i have the same holy ghost and you have the holy ghost then we can have fellowship i thought you know um my dad said the other day and it was so wonderful because he said you get around believers haven't you ever noticed and i forget the context in which you said it but he said sometimes you feel closer to the family of god than your own family and you think that's odd you know that's not odd it's actually very normal because you have kanona you're sharing something you're sharing the same bloodstream you're sharing the same organs you're the same source of life comes from the same exact place we have something in common you could go if you've never experienced it you go overseas somewhere and you don't know who's picking you up you don't know who's who's there you don't know who you'll meet but man in five minutes time it's like i've known this person my whole life it's that's that's because you have fellowship one with another it's the same holy spirit flowing through all of us and and it would it would take a surgical operation to separate us yeah because we have fellowship one with the other can you say amen you know what it's also you know what it's not fellowship is not friendship friends are good but let me just say this fellowship is deeper than friendship it goes further than friendship it's it's more sacred than friendship it's it's it's much it's a much cannon it's a much stronger word when you look up that greek word and it exists only between those who have the spirit only those who have the holy spirit there's a fellowship one with the other we're out of time let's all stand to our feet lord jesus we thank you for the word that we've read this morning means so much to us lord it's it's part of us lord we identify with it we just ask that you would take the words that we've spoken this morning may you establish it in their hearts lord be with the service the furthering of this service the preaching of the word the singing the music lord i pray god that your spirit would just come and feel welcome amongst us in jesus name amen
