bless you so enjoy that wonderful atmosphere of praise and worship want to just be loyal to the lord this morning and deliver our heart i want to read this from brother joe i suppose brother joe you intended me to read it uh yeah okay very good but jason i will be um showing up in charleston musc on tuesday the first at 5 30 a.m for a double bypass hearts opens an open heart surgery i'm requesting prayer from the church body for successful bypass surgery doctors confidence surgery will go well the main concern is the amount of time after surgery to remove breathing tube and a heightened risk of pneumonia uh look forward to getting back to church after surgery maybe about five weeks thank you all kindly and love each and every one of you all lord bless that's from brother joe amen the covid virus kind of injured his lungs and so there he's got an increased risk of of post-operative pneumonia which is always a risk but amen we're just going to trust the lord that the same one who brought him through that bring him through this amen so we're believing that that will be the case amen we're going to go right into the word uh this morning and we're going to have you find your place in genesis 17 and i've got a request that i'm going to catch here um okay and the dad's name was kevin yeah ellie ellie and kevin amen we'll read our text and then we will uh we'll take that to prayer it's a lengthy text i apologize for keeping you standing but let's look in genesis 17 amen we're going to catch uh verses 1 um if i sent you through 27 we're only going to go down through 22. i see why that's doing that yeah we're going to read 1-22 and when abram was 90 years old in nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect pretty tall order isn't it and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations now it's pretty incredible because the lord has given him seemingly an impossible task walk before me and be perfect but if you'll notice god is not asking abraham and he's not asking you today to do or be anything that he's not going to equip you for and so he god immediately because you can imagine how stunning that was imagine if you heard that and walk before me and be perfect but god is immediately going to come in the in verse 2 i'm going to make my covenant i got this abraham i'll multiply thee abraham falls on his face i guess i would have too and he says you know verse 4 my covenant is with thee thou shalt be a father of many nations neither now watch what god is going to do neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham so he's adding an h and in the hebrew h stands for deity so he's he's saying i'm making a covenant with you and this ain't going to be just name only this isn't just you know something you can put over or you know on a plaque on the wall i'm actually going to add deity into you to bring this to pass all right all right and i and he and he did the same thing to sarai and gay and changed her from sarai to sarah added an h to his bride also amen all right and i will make the verse six exceeding fruitful and i i will make i will make i've told you what i need you to do abraham but i'm making a covenant with you i'm going to do i'm going to go to work on this all right i will make the exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant so you see yourself there the children of abraham you've been enjoined by the blood through christ man all right so i will establish my covenant through in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after the verse eight and i will look at everything god is doing to bring this to pass i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land where wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god and god said unto abraham see nice calling by his new name thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seat after thee every man among you shall be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed he that is born in thine house and he that is bought with money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man man child whose flesh of the foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall sarah that is 90 years old bear and abram said unto god oh that ishmael might live before thee and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for his smell i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and i will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation but my covenant will i establish was with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham father we thank you for your word today we believe lord that you do all things well and you have portioned out the word to me along this series lord of the final season today we come lord what i hope and trust will be perhaps its final installment if not that's fine but we want to just carry lord to our burden on our heart is satisfied and looking within i can see and and granted the permission to stop so lord give us a ten of hearts and minds today lord and have mercy on us we're poor soft americans lord and it's a plague and so i pray you'll help us now to be attentive to your word father i trust that we came prepared to receive your word today may you now bless it and bless the ministry and father for these needs that are before you for these needs that brother ken and sister anita this poor little child the mother and father lord what a sad case that is but how you could turn that around lord in a moment father we appeal to you we appeal this case we will not accept the the final word and the final say that this can't end well lord we appeal to you father and i pray you have mercy on this case and for our own brother joe lord father we commit him into your hands this procedure that awaits him i believe it's your hand lord that's in control of it all and we commit him and commit our own hearts to believe with him joining our faith to his faith lord and you join your faith to our faith and you'll push this promise on through we commit it to you now in jesus christ's name amen god bless you friends you can be seated it's all right no worries we'll just do it the old-fashioned way i'd like to get that operational if we could son so um amen if you'll just uh i think i was scheduled now for the powerpoint i believe brother mark yeah so if you put that up for me all right praise the lord let me make a quick adjustment here make sure i've got the right one that's definitely that's definitely the right one okay now we're looking at the final season and our next slide will reveal that we're continuing with this harvest time our next slide please and we should see that come up there we go and now i want to i was going to read this to you out of the bible but i'm i decided for the to to save redundancy and save some time we would just go through it together thank you sir all right now paul is going to pick up in our opening slide when we when we advance to the next frame paul is going to uh kind of bring it all into perspective of you know why the world has went crazy all right even in his day and paul is just going to take one big 30 000 foot view and he's going to go all the way back coming out of the garden of eden and he's going to what he's attempting to do is explain how we got to where we are and the madness that was in the world and historically had always been in the world and even from paul's day they could look back through 4 000 years of old testament history and not just in israel but in babylon and among the medo-persians and among alexander and among the romans and all the gentile kingdoms how that they always were they they could start out ever so good but corruption and sin and iniquity would always eat them out from the inside and that's what happened to babylon it's what happened to the persians it's what happened to alexander it's what happened to the romans the roman republic started out on very noble ideas that they got from the greeks you know about uh being a republic they weren't an empire they were a republic when they first started you don't you can't really make the argument for empire until augustus probably but we find out that even under julius caesar there's still an imperial uh state and and they had a a government that that worked like a democracy of sorts they had a senate and they had you know they whenever they got in trouble they'd bring a caesar and give him you know autonomous power and then then when the crisis was over he would relinquish that and control would go back and they had courts and justice very much the same as our republic was founded on we're a long ways from it just like they got a long ways from it but corruption ate them out from the inside and that's always been the case and great great swaths of history deal with the perversions that have went on among fallen mankind in every civilized even in the civilized countries and perversions of all kinds and paul is just going to say look i'm just going to give you an explanation and it not only happened in the gentiles that happened to the jews to where by the time you get to ahab i mean it's just complete corruption everywhere and and and and finally they're taken uh captive uh by the assyrians and then by the babylonians and so we we find out that he picks up here coming out of genesis now this is this is man starting to cover the face of the earth and you know what's going to happen you know the story he's going to end up all the way to genesis 6 and you're going to have the story of noah and the bible says that men's mind all over the world by the time you get to genesis 6 man's mind is just evil continually there's no let up in it morning noon and night in some time zone evil is being conspired all right and being perpetrated and so uh then it's going to go from there god's going to recycle it's going to start again it's going to go into shinar by that time and sham goes off the scene and then samira must get started in babylon and here we go again and by the time it reaches abram's day lot is in sodom and you you can see what's happening around the world again and so we find that that jesus would prophesy that that that when there would come an end age and we're we're at it that that one of the signs that you would see and you would know that it's the la that it's the end age and the end of the end age all right is that you would see the double whammy you would see the convergence of the days of noah and the days of lot converge upon humanity and that's uh that had been unprecedented we never had that you understand you'd see the god of this evil age literally become lucifer amen so that that's where we are and i i hope that you're awake to that today i you know i i particularly hope teenagers will pay keen attention because you you you you now live you're you're you're making decisions now in this early portion of you if you're a young man or young woman or even in your 20s and even young married couples and all of us really we're making decisions and you need to make an informed decision and the greatest informed decision you can make is to be informed that satan is the god of everything he's the god of science and politics he's behind all of it every civilization is ruled orchestrated built and controlled by satan and it's always been that way all right let's go through it romans 1. all right we're going to start at verse 21 speaking of coming out of the garden now because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made like to corruptable man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things next slide wherefore now watch so here's here's god's reaction to what man just did now what we just read did god do that or did man do that man did that now god is it's time now god's gonna respond all right wherefore god gave also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever next slide for this cause all right so now god don't read don't read ahead now god's gonna up the ante because they committed this god responded then instead of repenting they get worse so now god's going to go to the next step for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature this hasn't just been in our day this has been down through history and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burning their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat from the nlt it says they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserve now you know what the you know what part of the penalty is not only their physical afflictions but the madness that that germinated around the world see and so you know a lot of times friends you can come out of the world and and god save you from something and and bring you to your senses and bring you to a new birth you know you you need to you actually kind of have a little bit of an advantage on the devil because remember it starts out with the devil knowing all your weaknesses he knows all your vulnerabilities he's watched you from birth see he said why has he paid so much attention to you because he's afraid of you see now i know he tries to make you think it's the other way around you need to be afraid of him but he's actually terrified of you see brother branham said a son a son or daughter of god holy ghost field go down walk down the street demons howl and faint [Music] at your approach oh no it's a son of god run high don't get exposed because that's their strength is in hiding and so so we we find that that when god cleans you up now you know where your weaknesses are yeah now you have an obligation to keep the guard up over that now see say oh i've been born again i praise god you know it won't bother me to go back to those on old old haunts oh yes it will don't do that that's why you need new friends and new associations and new activities and new recreation you need you need to make changes to your life because it's up to you your response because listen friends you got to keep that garden weeded out from all of those seeds you germinated during your sinful life don't think they won't try to come up just because you're a christian amen little 101 on how to be an overcomer all right uh they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved i i was watching you know a news video of of the governor from california trying to get his mind around you know the the latest the latest mass shooting the latest one and you know we've averaged one one on one a month since 2016. uh matt was talking about columbine today and we've had we've literally averaged a mass shooting on average once a month in this country and so so so we're we're realizing that the world's gone insane and he's trying to say he comes on the on the air what's wrong with america and i'm going wow you really are blind what's up what's the problem with us why can't we get this fixed and i just sit there i first i felt sorry for him i thought but but thinking i want to say governor knew some thinking yourself wise you become a fool and you don't see it's right in front of you and the twisted perversions of man's mind you're not going to fix that by passing a law you're not going to fix that by restricting this or restricting that or the the the problem is sin and corruption has eaten society from the inside it there will be no peace brother branham said till jesus comes and sets up a new kingdom in the millennium it'll be right here it'll be one world government oh amen to that i'm all for one world government as long as i got the right king on the throne see verse next slide verse 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge see they didn't want they didn't want to do that god god just keeps upping the ante they they keep moving god keeps responding god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled watch now being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignancy here's the governor's answer right here now the society is filled with this see whispers next slide verse 30 back biters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents i'm pretty sure that if anybody would read these passages honestly you wouldn't be asking the question what's wrong with the world because literally you're reading cause and effect cause and effect paul starts coming out of genesis they used to know god they made a decision they didn't really want him in their thinking so they they changed him they started worshiping the creation they didn't want god because they didn't want to be responsible to him now this is where they've ended up verse 32 who knowing the judgment of god they're intelligent people that they which commit such things are worthy of death say that's a bold statement how does paul know that people feel that way why do you think we have the courts and people are in jail and people get executed because they know these things are wrong mankind's not stupid he knows that these things are wrong see and that's why we have penalty in the law who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them you've seen it i've seen it the more heinous twisted and perverted a music star is the more they celebrate him or her or them the more twisted perverted and heinous a movie star is they celebrate him or her the more twisted and perverted the more of a bad boy you can be in the sports world the more famous they will they they will laud and praise you and you you get on you get on you know your national um influence and you you know you've got a child who who you're going to encourage that you know you can be a boy or a girl and i'm proud of my son or my daughter whichever one he or she wants to be that day and everybody oh you're such a good dad you're such a brave parent pray oh we just you're the one you're the wonder of the world man's helping his child go to hell is what he's doing and and all of his nba rings and all of his millions in the bank are gonna go to ash and cinder don't chase it young people that's not anything to be proud of that is perversion and god is going to shake and rock and burn this world to the ground and start over in a righteous kingdom and i want to be a part of that kingdom we have come to the final season now we can make a conclusion next slide what can we conclude in this reading you know when when when i look around at the world i i find that i can conclude a number of things i can conclude with because now i see the days of noah yeah wow i see it the days of lot yes i see it what about all these backbiters and haters of god and despite from proud most inventors of people thinking it turns out natural understanding covenant breakers natural faction and black of blood and merciful yes i see that so what is your conclusion my conclusion is next slide that when they knew god they glorified him not as god i can conclude we have returned to this again the reason the world is the way it is is because this is currently present amen because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god let's just bring it super relevant you think that what god sent a prophet was done in a corner it went around the world seven times but whole books have been written about that ministry all talking about how it was the spearhead to the great revival that it was by far and above the most supernatural if all the other ones combined still wouldn't equal that ministry of william branham that's the testimony of historians i can't hear i can't help what bone dead idiots think about what they want to say about him i'm going by historical fact and and so his peers who actually lived in his day not people a half century later who think they know more about it that's profound that's the ebb of stupidity and i'm not sure which is dumber that they think that or that they think they can convince me to think that and i don't know which is dumber but i'm sorry that doesn't work for a student of history i go back and i get the people who are actually there who saw it and lived it and testified and wrote books about it see all right so but what we find is that when that was happening christianity pentecost the world politics the white house was represented in the film deep calleth to the deep oh yes the vice president states was attending that meeting and saw that gift of melchizedek saw that ministry of the son of man because that when they knew god they surely knew that was god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools professing themselves to be wise they became fools so i can conclude that that that that we can see today that mankind is manifesting the same things as in the days of noah and in the days of lot then i can conclude this is true now this whole cycle started again and that's why we are where we are governor newsome hear me this is why god sent a word that would have fixed it you rejected it now now that now you're dealing with the headlines you're dealing with i'm glad i'm not a part of this world i'm glad i'm a pilgrim and a stranger i'm not identified with it i'm identified i'm a citizen from another world i have my citizenship i'm living after the life of my rebirth hallelujah all of this happened all right you can take the powerpoint down all of that happened every dreadful descriptive term that paul used heady high-minded truth-breakers false accused incontinent fierce we talk about it yesterday in the men's meeting fierce and such murder and envy brother matt preaching on it today in the sunday school teaching on it in the sunday school and and and i i thought about this at home you know everything that paul wrote about that world we now have and do you realize that this all came where we are today i want this to sink in it all came under the watch of 266 popes today 1.2 billion catholics worldwide this all came under the watch of 2 000 years of church age reformers mainly since mainly as a since luther um and and and it has yielded today it has yielded today two billion non-catholic protestants and globally you ready for this ford a staggering 45 000 christian protestant denominations that's the latest from the center for the study of global christianity on life life science.com just to give you the reference we have arrived you've got a governor saying what is wrong and i just want to raise my hand and go do you realize that we have come to this under the watch of 266 popes 1.2 billion catholics 2 000 years of of church age reformers and protestant reformation since the days of luther to where we now have 2 billion protestants and 45 000 denominations we've arrived at where we are under all of that watch and then somebody want to tell me we didn't need a prophet somebody want to try to convince me that we didn't need the return of thus saith the lord hallelujah friends i'm glad for thus saith the lord in this hour where else would you turn where would you go 45 000 get in line take your choice people want to say oh you're called okay well who's the truth we are well get in line please there's 45 000 of you just get in line hallelujah i don't plan to stand in that line i'm going to take thus saith the lord and they want to argue with william branham when he told them that the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god that she has become her own mouthpiece and that god through his prophet and his bride will confound her because she has thus saith the lord i'm glad for that she has thus saith the lord and she keeps still in other words we only preach what thus saith the lord taught i don't preach any mongrel eyes any mixed any credo any any none of that i have i only preached thus saith the lord or i don't preach and then you've got misguided people i firmly believe children of god but misguided to tell me i shouldn't even preach well how am i ever going to fulfill what he said if i'm not preaching if i if i'm only pushing play i push play i promise you i push play more than they do who say push play push play all the time i'm constantly pushing play i push it morning noon and night it plays in my house constantly plays in my truck it plays in my earbuds hallelujah i'm proud of what god did [Applause] but how am i ever going to fulfill to confound them he'll confound them through the messenger because the bride under her messenger is the final voice to the final age see so oh it's just so upside down and so yet under under the watch of all that we have come full circle back to the days of noah again we've come full circle i'm i'm sorry parents i i know this is bad news you're trying to raise children i'm sorry to report to you we have come full circle back to the days of sodom again back to the days where men's minds are evil continually oh moms and dads get full of the holy ghost hallelujah be filled with the spirit of god so that you can provide a straight and narrow way not just words but a life of words man-made religion has brought us right back to it again only worse now because convergence both of them see and then god will certainly do the same in judgment my goodness this world they think the anadoluvian world and sodom was a catastrophe i'm telling you he's going to purge his threshing floor one last time he's going to pour out wrath the likes of which the world has never seen the bible said there was never a day like it and never will be a day like it again thank god hallelujah so when we come then to our our promise to abraham it's very interesting because everything we're standing on today is based on what god promised this man we're sons and daughters of god we're children of abraham we've been enjoined by the blood of christ back through so there's neither jew or gentile bond nor free male or female we're all one in christ and we are joined to abraham who was the father of our faith and therefore every covenant promise that god made to abraham is now applying to us in fact is we're here to finish this thing you're the this is the final season this is harvest time see this is the age of the word and the word only see no no mongrelizing see say oh yeah it's just preaching and teaching no power well that's not the word the the word is filled with power the word is filled with signs and wonders the word the word operates the gifts properly and in order and decently you understand it's not doing away with any of those things it's finally reaching a point where we're operating them with maturity see and so so we find that abraham has given all of these promises these commitments by god and as i said to you what abraham was told to do i mean you he he might as well not even get out of bed walk before me and be perfect i might as well not even step to the i'll still stay in the dugout i'm not even going to go to the batter's box much less step up to the plate that's hopeless really abraham listen listen abraham i'm going to be the one doing it god was saying i'm going to make a covenant with you and i'm going to make you the father of nations and i'm going to make kings come out of you don't worry abraham i got this and abraham the best that abraham can do is he thinks it's funny not funny like you're listening to a comedian but it's it's so astonishing that it's ridiculous to him everything you're saying i get it i hear what you're saying lord i get it i understand what you're saying but i i don't think you really know me if you honestly think that i can be perfect and walk before you perfectly and you know what he says now here's the promise it's going to be through isaac and abraham and it's going to come through sarah and abraham's already waited so long and he took a detour and he's got ishmael and and the bible makes a difference and i'm going to turn to and read it today just let me give you this in the new testament i can't remember where it is but we can find it but the bible describes how that isaac is the child of the promise but that ishmael is the child of of his flesh in other words his desires you understand you've got all kinds of things in your life that are a result of you following your desires i'm here to tell you god can't use any of them he's got a he or he can only use what his word produces in you see and so abraham is now pleading you know oh that ishmael might live before me so abraham is literally asking you know he's asking that that god allow the best efforts of his human flesh to be enough how about that lord i know you want me to be perfect and walk before you but what you're saying is so the world is so bad and i got so many problems and i was raised this way and i was born this way and this happened to me when i was a child and this preacher did this and this spouse did this and do you have any idea what i've been through come on does that sound familiar and i got this weakness and i got this from how about this please can i can i just give you my best human effort and we're just call it done that's what he's asking he's asking that the child of his desires of his flesh be the let the promise follow him and so god is showing god comes right back and says absolutely no sarah shall bear thee a son indeed and my covenant would be with him and then god just finally the bible says and god just left talking to him he didn't even wait for abraham to reply again god's already know god already knows what he's going to do with me and nobody knows what he's going to do with you and i don't need him to explain everything to me i just say lord take over my life we find friends that abraham here is asking that his best efforts of human flesh be enough but revelation 12 shows us that that's not what god is aiming at god is not aiming at that i don't have time to read it today but go through revelation 12 today but if you if you'll go there when you get home you'll find that it talks about there's war in heaven now you can't read revelation like a newspaper it doesn't chronologically work like that you don't even you don't even read an event and say this and then this and then this and then this because that's not how it happens what you have to do when you're reading the book of revelation is go this meanwhile this was happening meanwhile this was also happening meanwhile this was also happening and it was all working in one harmonious thing and god was working it all down through history plugging in the pieces of where it needed to go so that when you go through the seals and you pick up the seals in chapter six and chapter seven and then you you come to to a silence in chapter eight and the seventh seal and then you go to the trumpets and here's the seven trumpets it almost looks like god's gonna go see a one two three four five six seven and then we're gonna start on the trumpets but you found out that when the seals got open we found out oh no meanwhile the trumpets were happening and god's been running the gentiles and the jews through the same gauntlet coming to the same thing at the same time you get that so he says war was in heaven michael and his angels remember fought against lucifer and michael overcame and lucifer was cast out that almost sounds like revelation 12 after the rapture that must happen in the tribulation no that happened all the way back before genesis even built the earth there was war in heaven it only spilled over into the earth that war in revelation 12 is is still being fought paul identified it and said you're not fighting against flesh and blood that's the same battle you're fighting against principalities and powers of the air and powers of wickedness and darkness in high places that's the battle that war is going on right now but if you go into revelation 12 you find out that that at that god comes to a point where finally in revelation four and show this to be true zechariah 3 i don't have time to preach on all that today but we find out that that satan is cast down i think in verse 10 i believe 10 or 11. and now he's not cast to the earth yet that don't happen for two more verses in chapter in verse 13. he's cast to the earth and then because the bride went up and when the bride went physically up satan was physically cast down but two or three verses ahead of that he's already been cast down not cast into the earth but removed from his position as an antagonizer to accuse you before god or to discourage you to tell you you're not going to be successful you're not perfect to try to bring guilt about all your life and and discourage you but this bride has already been insulated by predestination she can't be deceived and no amount of guilt trip from the devil can get me to stop fighting i can't be deceived i might get mixed up in my doctrine but i'm going to keep marching and god will straighten me out why because zechariah 3 revelation 5 you don't see the accuser there in zechariah 3 he is judicially dismissed his case is thrown out and he's ran out of the courtroom forever satan has literally lost his position to accuse you before god he's working on redemption and in redemption he's not dealing with sin because you're already perfect hallelujah you're already the spotless chaste virgin pride of the word why because you have believed the report glory to god that's why chapters four and five aren't action chapters they're they're they're they're the setting of judgment they're preparing for the seals to be opened amen and you don't see lucifer there you see john representing the bride you see a strong angel representing elijah this day you see you see one seat on the throne just like in zechariah 3 just like in daniel 7 daniel 9 ancient of days and and you find zerubbabel the high priest or joshua the high priest representing all of god's elected family and the accusation is true it's legit israel was sinning it was true and god dismissed it all didn't matter on what authority did god dismiss it election he said this is jerusalem this is zion this is my bride whom i have chosen there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ calvary fixed that this opening of the seals is what brought that back to you and me hallelujah we stand today perfect we stand i don't need god to accept a half deal of my best human effort all i have to do is surrender my heart and receive the baptism of the holy ghost and then the blood speaks for me and a power greater than my life controls my life this is what he did when he unsealed the word which then unsealed you no one knew you were there you didn't know you were there when he unsealed when he became the mighty god unveiled suddenly we realized wow he wasn't three and neither was he won like your finger because that doesn't speak of his body i realize now that he has a body who's part of god's godhead because it's all by extension all by expression god just expressing himself down through each age not beautiful and so so we find then that he's been cast down he's been removed from his position to bring accusations and condemnations condemnation to the to to those of who have been redeemed by the lamb lost his position aren't you glad and then afterwards the brightest comes to her fullness of adoption body change she goes up and in verse 13 then satan is cast unto the earth see and so in this cycle literally of shout voice and trumpet the lamb has literally claimed the book and he's unsealed the word and that's what we're feeding on today not the body of a man the body word or the son of man see and so meanwhile meanwhile while all of that's going on and happening in real time and has happened in our lifetime amen i mean look at look at the connection of history of god we've got humans in this building who were alive and there when a seals were opened and now we've got their offspring and their offspring's offspring and their offspring's offspring offspring and here we are with this connected bridge of god's elected family at the end time all getting all going through the final stages of perfection all being those final elements of of of maturing those last names calling out of the book of life around the world i'm here to tell you something friends we're getting out of here soon we're getting out of here soon the generation that saw that can't fully pass away till all things be fulfilled so the last names then are are being called to the marriage feast and while this is happening the world systems of fallen men are crumbling and you see it every day his systems of government science education politics all falling epically all falling and failing at at unprecedented the madness is is not only indescribable but completely unexplainable unexplainable and so we find then that society literally is unraveling we see it in the headlines every day and so so so so this is the time you see now you've got hebrews 9 coming into play which says that referring here in verse 28 so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many see and at calvary and unto them that look for him shall he appear remember paul said i those not there's a great crown of life for not only me only but for all those who love his appearing amen remember i told you how that that you're to look for a special grace and a wisdom at at the appearing of christ at the end time at the revelation of jesus christ brother branham said in in i think in easter seal he said a seal has something bound up inside and when you break the seal it releases what's inside and then and when it when it got broken we found out it was a person it was christ and it was the word and then the word was fed to the people and then brother branham says then down comes an anointing to fall upon that word and make it live in your life and in my life hallelujah that's why we keep pressing on that's why we won't quit that's why when i fail i get back up again that's why i won't stop hallelujah and so so but he says here he offered he was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time the second time without sin unto salvation see now jesus has always been without sin so what do you mean he's going to appear the second time without sin unto salvation jesus has always been without sin so it's more a reference now to his purchased possession he appears in her he appears in you without sin by a perfect faith and a perfect god perfect god who gave a perfect word keeping a perfect promise to bring forth a perfect people you understand why satan has no chance to stop you do you realize that that it's that it's inexorably the right you're you're headed to a rapture inexorably there's nothing that can stop it there's nothing that can change it anything satan can think of god's already ran ahead and fixed it hallelujah and so she stands perfect the bleeding word speaking for her she stands brother branham said is the spotless perfection of christ we see that in revelation 11 1 she becomes the her last visible sign in the earth before she's taken she's literally the measurable perfection of his tabernacle she is him brother brandon would say see so you know let me let me let me change gears okay this isn't just a bible study lesson today do you all recognize everything i'm preaching do you did you get it am i explaining it sufficiently that you get it you go wow we really are in a unique epic moment of history and meanwhile while god is doing all this meanwhile the world is falling apart meanwhile satan's being exalted as the god meanwhile a bride is being called names are being called bride has been called to a feast she's being perfected last elements of perfection do you hear today do you here today recognize the intent of god for your life yeah how many raise up your hand say i recognize it i see it brother jason my goodness i never knew it was so beautiful but i see it today i recognize the intent of god for my life wow i stand perfect the accuser's gone he he he's he's called me to walk before him in perfection and i can't do it but but but he's he's gonna do it in me see well if you recognize all this friends and if you hear today recognize the intent of god then surely you can see that there is no chance god is going to let you get by with just your best human effort amen surely you get that don't doze on me i'm in a high gear here don't fall asleep amen i i i'd like to say that as as an instruction to parents i'd like to see you put your children to sleep at a decent hour on saturdays so they don't sleep on me on sunday and so that i don't walk out on the platform and look out in their faces and see that they barely have their eyes opened could we have that parents could you have a little more discipline in your homes and actually be a parent and not just a breadwinner all right so surely today friends we can see now i'm coming to the real heart of what god really burdened me on all right you can surely see that there is no chance that god is going to leave you to your best human effort this is the life everything i've preached about today is god's design for us not catch it not living in the desires and pleasure of our humanity this is what abraham was pleading oh could i just could could we just call it my best effort could you just let ishmael who's already here he's already a grown boy how about you just take it with him please can we just what you're saying is too hard i'm overwhelmed just hearing you say with the requirements can can i please just do my best and we'll just call it a deal see so he god is not willing to allow us to just live in the desires and pleasure of our humanity if you look at i don't have time to go into it today but if you look if you go to jeremiah 23 you you find the name of god and it gives him an actual name he shall be called the lord our righteousness if you just go ten chapters later by the time he gets finished with his family now the bible says she in verse chapter 33 she shall be called the lord our righteousness did you know that you see so there's this process god is not just willing to to to just be god alone his whole plan was to have a family who are modeled after the word see and so the anointing on god's family in every age then is to return us to genesis and in genesis you had you had a man and a woman who were so perfectly in harmony he called their plural their name singular adam and even when she was expressed out of him him and her had such a relationship toward each other it was flawless and in that flawless relationship they enjoyed a perfect fellowship with the father and you understand he's not interested in you with your best human desires he's interested in bringing back that relationship that fellowship that we that he had with us before the foundation of the world sin interrupted it but god started working immediately to restore it all back see a process he started a process and what is the process doing it's expanding our character not just our understanding of the word he gives you the word he wants you to arrive at revelation 12. and to get there he's going to put you through the paces to where you're just like him and you're not going to be able to plead abraham's plea let me just let the best efforts of my human frailty be enough no it's not going to it's not about good works and how many good works you can do or how many how good you can be on sunday it's not about that you're gonna he's trying to get you to a relationship see brother branham says in the masterpiece the great sculptor when he's seen his family the masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because because he's god and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately to begin to build it again unto his own image of man amen see this is why friends angels will never be able to sing redemption song with you because they weren't lost and redeemed you come lost and god has redeemed you back to god through christ and he's growing your life into the image of the word there's got to be such a similarity of of it like like brother branham says elijah and elisha says their names even sound almost the same elijah elisha and if you if you look elisha had to follow him and when he when elijah was taken home elijah said ask what you will and he says elijah says ask what i'll do for you he says that uh that your life will be duplicated in me i wanna i want your life doubled so that it can come on me see i want to have just what you got the anointing on you i want to have that anointing on me a double portion your your anointing doubled amen re you copied and put in paste it into me all right you get me so so he he's not he's not asking to have you know twice your godliness twice your power twice your office twice your anointing he's asking for everything you've got i want to be i want to have that and that's the model of christ and his bride we're not trying to be greater than christ you understand we're trying to be the same as christ so with jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen we're not trying to put emphasis on the bride at the expense of the groom if it wasn't for the groom the bride wouldn't stand a chance understand but since the groom was successful now he's working on the bride and he just need to say today lord keep working keep working don't let me lay back in my best human effort lord you're that that's not a deal you're not interested in that that's not what you had in mind in revelation 12. see and so elisha would have to struggle during his journey to immortality to gain the spirit of elijah he would have to come to a greater surrender personally and that's where you are today that you know that that's only by that could he perform the same sign that elijah elijah's greatest thing that he ever did was open the jordan because the jordan represents death and it represented crossing over from this side through death into the next side and into the promised land that's why joshua led them across the jordan amen because the jordan is death and then you go into the land of the holy ghost the promised land you follow me and salvation is the greatest thing god could ever do for you give you the baptism of the holy ghost amen once you do that then then then the fix is in then it's just god working on your maturity and so when it but when elisha comes back to the jordan now he's got the mantle it fell on him he's he's there's plenty of anointing there plenty of power he's definitely got the calling all right and you know what he does he takes the mantle folds it brother brandon said he folds it just like elijah did he's trying to copy you know elijah you know i'll just i'll have the same belt buckle and i'll drive the same kind of car and i'll have a briefcase just like it and uh and i'll i'll memorize quotes but you know what he couldn't open the jordan doing that he folded it just like elijah and struck it and nothing happened see brother branham talked about he had he had elijah's robe and he brother branham in the second and second-handed robe he talks about how that's a good robe christ that that that was what christ had so what christ gives us we that's the second handed robe is a good robe see elijah elisha had a good robe he had a a perfect second-handed robe but what he was missing was a first-hand experience see he didn't have the same experience as elijah he had his robe he had his there's plenty of anointing but he didn't have brother branham says it like this and witness the message witness jesus talking to his disciples you're okay today stay with me now come on y'all owe me i don't preach long so if i go a little bit today just stay with me i don't wear you out come on do i all right now stay with me so so we finally says here in witness when jesus is saying his disciples remember you're going to go in wait 10 days being dude with power he's on the mountain he says now he didn't say i want you to go now and be my witness all right watch he said he didn't say he didn't say i want you to go now and be my witness he said you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and then shall you be witness see you must have a first-hand experience if i go down here to the worst road house or the whiskey house or in phoenix tonight i love this kentucky word gambling divisities okay and every person in there that would be drinking and i'd walk up to him and say what do you think of christ and he would say oh he's the son of god brother branham says that don't make him saved it'll make him saved you hear me teenagers you hear me i don't make him saved see watch then i'd say how do you know he's the son of god he'd say well my mother told me so well maybe mother was right but what about you see if i went out here to a church member and i said what do you think of jesus christ who was he oh he was the son of god how do you know my pastor said so your pastor's right but what do you know about it see mother's right pastor's right but before you know he's the son of god the bible said no man can say jesus is the christ only by the holy ghost the holy ghost has to witness it to you it must be a personal experience he says i hope you see that i'm saying that today i hope you see that see no matter how much listen no matter how much you go to church how well your name is engraved on its stained windows or what more or on its book it'll never mean nothing to you until you are a witness of the resurrection of jesus christ by the infilling of the power of the holy spirit you're taking somebody else's word for it amen well brother branham i know that jesus is the christ because the bible said so the bible's right but what do you know about it it's an individual affair with every individual it must if i say must it must be a personal witness that every person must have in order to know that jesus christ is the son of god is when his spirit bears record with your spirit in an experience of the new birth born again and then you cry abba father amen a personal experience that that it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you and if he reveals himself to you and you catch who he is and you still want to be you you you need a psychiatrist you need you need prayer you need something you're just abraham saying oh let ishmael come on let ishmael be the one but that's not what he's after he's after mr and mrs jesus christ he's after elijah and elisha that's the model he's after the spirit and the bride say come he's after a hazarus and esther seated on the throne together speaking in one voice at the time of the feast of tabernacles at the time of israel's restoration there's a bride seated on the throne in an invisible union saying the same thing he's saying she's entered into it by a personal experience see oh i'm so out of time i got so much material i'm not going to be able to get it all yeah you're right mike thank you all right give me revelation 5. do y'all hear that tomorrow's a holiday young sleep in school's done tomorrow's a holiday amen give me revelation 5 11 to 14. i need you got 20 minutes i won't go longer i'll watch it that's tense ten till i'll stop it ten after we'll stand on the brakes pull the parachute bring matt back amen amen revelation 5 11 to 14 and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders uh let's wait till we get it up i want you to see it revelation 5 11 to 14. amen let me just get keep reading and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne now i want you to catch these three elements angels around the throne and beast and elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice verse 12 saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever now here is a tremendous confederation here you've got you've got this confederation of angels of agents that have worked in tandem to achieve this scene you're seeing see so to bring john to this place that john has been caught to to bring him to this place was a culmination of a lifetime of growth all right a lifetime of purpose and at times you know being led uh by these various agents are being driven by them depending on one's willingness to be led amen you can either be driven cattle or lead sheep but he's not going to lose one amen so let me say it today depending on whether you're willing to be a sheep and be led if you're not then he'll drive you like cattle but he's not going to lose one and here we find that angels now brother branham talks about angels that accompanies through life we learn from the sunday school we call them oh our guardian angel brother branham talks about that's real and he said they're actually assigned to you and he said they don't go back home amen they don't go back home they stay with you through life to help you on your journey brother joe they'll be with you don't worry you'll be surrounded by see they they rode on in your car and on the hood i hope you weren't going too fast they came with you to church they walked in here with you they'll leave with you they go with you everywhere you see and so you have this confederation of agents and then you have these beast powers beasts are anointing just like i was talking about the unsealed word then an anointing drops down remember the anointing on the babylonians on the persians on the grecians on the romans it meant they were undefeatable in army because why they they they were anointed alexander's no way with a fraction of his men fraction of the men that the persians had no way for him to be successful but he wasn't just successful he was wildly successful why because he was anointed he couldn't be defeated the bible had already said the goat tramples the ram and then the beast with iron teeth broke his horn and trampled him a man drove northwest east and south no one could stand before him and that fourth power stayed all the way to today and it went from political rome to to religious rome which is far has far more control and influence over the world now than it ever did with its armies now it uses our armies amen it sure does and so so we find these beast powers these anointings and then you've got these theophanies these elders one of them actually spoke to john i said don't cry john the the lion it's all going to be okay how do you know cause i john you're you're actually on an island in in patmos you've only been caught up here in the spirit we're you're actually seeing the end i'm standing here at the end you're actually brought up here in a spiritual vision and you're watching the end trust me i'm at the end i know we win so stop crying it's gonna be okay the lamb the lamb what he did at calvary remember you saw that don't worry he prevailed and when he started to see a line he sees a lamb and so so you have all of this confederation and and and what are they doing the these the these angels and these anointing these beast powers these this theophany as brother diggs was showing us the other night you've uh brother ram said you've heard from your theophany when what did he say he said amen to every word every time i hear the word preach something inside of me different from me not exactly me something says amen even when i don't understand it it keeps me moving i have to go i have to go this way i can't not so what are they doing they're bringing you know a way that's impossible to stop or to prevent they're bringing all sides to their predestinated climax whether it's the the white horse red horse black horse pale horse whether it's the lion the ox the the man or the eagle bringing the elected family you understand friends the history of the world is all funneling down now it's all coming together and winding up in one final climax and there's where we have arrived and it's bringing both god's family and lucifer's family inexorably bringing us all to a predestinated climax now now to my real burden we're back to abraham and abraham pleading how about just my best human effort you see there's always the tendency of a man mankind to take the path of least resistance there's always abraham wanted this this you know abraham wanted this right now idea this easier idea this less resistant idea i mean the thought of of waiting longer and i've already waited a long time and now you want me to wait longer and i you mean i gotta i gotta keep fighting and and battling all my weaknesses and frailties i how about you just take the way i am and let's just call it a day i i i don't want to keep fighting i'm tired and wait a long time and what you're asking you're asking me just to stay in the thick of it man i need a vacation i need to go disney world and you're wanting you're wanting me to stay in the thick of it my arm is so tired you want me to keep swinging a sword yep i need you to keep going because well why because i'm still working on you i'm still bringing you down this path see you you you're you you know the thought of having to fight on through our natural human frailty that wars against our faith doesn't it friends peter warns us about that dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul so you know you know the the the abraham already had faith god had already confirmed that he already had certified he was certified he gave him the sign of circumcision that certified that abraham had the right kind of faith that wasn't the point abraham had certified faith but what abraham wasn't willing to do was keep battling keep going keep believing keep trusting letting god do it he wanted the easier path the thought of the continued struggle weighing on his mind you know i remember brother branham telling the story and i'm i'm coming to a close i got 11 minutes to keep my promise brother brown tells a story about and i started to find it and get the details but it would just slow me down let me just do it from memory i'm sure you've read it where i think it's a dream and he he's with a brother it seemed like it might have been welch evans best i can remember and they were on the side of a river driving cattle and brother branham said now now brother welch he said i'm going to run ahead he said you keep pushing him he said i gotta run ahead because on up the trail he said there's a cut across and you see over on the other side of the river it's all smooth and nice and clean and easy walking see he said they're gonna want to go over there because it's natural they want the path of least resistance and here it's rocky and pitted and there's limbs and stickers and they don't like it over here and they'd rather be over there but i can't let them get over there brother welch you keep them going forward i'm going to run ahead and be waiting at the crossing and when they try to cross i'm going to keep them from crossing they've got to stay on this ba on this harder way they can't cross over there that other side is where the masses lead to destruction see and so so so so man doesn't want to press toward a mark or a goal press toward the mark of the high college man doesn't like to set goals you know that's why it has to be told to do that that's why school teachers tell you and counselors tell you and and and school counselors start telling you set a goal set goals you need to set goals because we don't like to press we don't like that to to do that you know even self-help gurus know that you need to strive uh as the bible says for masteries but but only the word of god tells you what kind of masteries to strive for and how to go about it and it warns you don't do it the way the world does laying up treasures here because all that'll happen here is thieves will break in and steal it rust and moth and corruption will go after it and you'll come to the end of your life and when the fiery trials come it'll reveal that you built your christianity on wood hay and stubble instead of gold silver and precious stones you'll be a christian you'll be saved you'll make it but everything you've lived for and built here will go in up in in smoke i i don't want to build my life like that i don't want to ask god please how about you just take me the best i can do with my own human weaknesses don't make me keep struggling don't make me keep fighting don't make me keep lord my weaknesses my faith and the lord just says nope that's no deal that's no deal it's not going to be ishmael it's not going to be your flesh not interested in your best effort what i actually need you to do is just surrender and have a first-hand experience that second-hand robe you got is a good one it's a really good one but what you need is a first-hand experience and have that exact same anointing there is an anointing upon us friends and it's driving us like cattle or it's leading us like sheep but i just want to encourage you with this that that that the promise of the scripture says in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem that's the desire of my heart for me and for you and your little ones and if they grow into another generation and have more little ones i'll keep preaching it just like this god god when you look here at isaiah 4 2 and 3 you see the purpose of god for your life and it ain't let ishmael stand before thee that's never going to fly with god accept it today god sees you in revelation 12 already perfected he's already made the covenant he's already dismissed the enemy you already have the privilege to walk in the presence and be be part of hebrews 13 8 jesus christ and his bride mr and mrs jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's my desire friends i hope that's your desire stand up with me brother matt bring your team i hope that's your desire today to say lord i i i i don't want to shrink from the fight i don't want to just say lord it's just too much it's just too much i just want to cruise i just want to take it easy no that's never going to that's never going to be accepted with god he's desiring your life to come and be something more than just the best effort of your human weakness why don't you bow your heads with me over the building today i thank you lord i thank you that i was able to finish and i feel quite finished suddenly i have more notes but i just feel suddenly finished and we'll perhaps make that a completely different thing but it'll be up to you i never really worry about it but i believe that today everything that you wanted said was said and lord that last portion was only added early this morning as the sun was coming up that last portion father to to remind the people don't chase the path of least resistance don't try to cross the river to the other side keep going don't don't shrink from the warfare don't don't dabble around in the lust of the world because that war is against your soul don't do that strive for masteries the correct way turn your life turn its priorities over to becoming everything that god desires and don't be afraid of the fight don't be afraid that that your character has to be built and that and i get abraham dreading it i get we dread it we we dread the we hear it we rejoice over character is a victory and not a gift but boy when it comes down to getting it sometimes lord because even the least of trials that are sent to perfect us are are described in the bible is fiery and we don't always want that lord but i do want the promise i do want to accomplish what i see there i want to stand with john and i want all the heaven to hear me i want him to hear i say blessing and honor and glory to him that liveth forever and ever oh let all the earth hear me say it lord god you've provisioned everything you've given me everything that i would need so i commit myself to you today afresh let us double our purposes lord let us redouble our effort to say father know that whole thing that about let ishmael know no never mind forget i thought that let my flesh just my best human effort with all my frailties no lord hey if i've ever suggested that please just forget i ever said that [Music] you've made a covenant with me and i want to i want to be involved in that covenant so i pray today that you be my helper help me not to move around in the world this world has gone crazy lord and i i don't want to be a part of it i all i want to do is get rescue everybody i can and i want to go to heaven i want to take everybody i can with me everybody who'll listen anybody i'll talk to him preach to him plead with them try to live an example before him lord i need help i need your help and i need the help of your church i can't do it all here from this pulpit lord i need moms and dads committed i need grandpas and grandmas committed i need i need siblings who who already have had an experience with the holy spirit be an example to those under you be filled with the holy ghost press the battle press toward the mark don't don't don't dilly dally in the world don't hold back press forward i know it's fiery i know it i know it's harder the harder way but keep going the reward is indescribable we commit it to you today lord i pray that the word which went forth accurately and in truth i pray to find its resting place lord let it be an arrow of deliverance that falls into the heart lord if anybody's bound by any kind of a thing holding them back may the era of deliverance strike that thing may it kill it out of their life strike the enemy right in his heart lord god may he lose his grip on our lives father i raise up my hands and i pray this prayer as solomon did raised up his hands lord i raise up my hands over this people lord that it let it be so that if any of them be in in trouble and call on your name and believe your word then you'll hear from heaven and deliver them lord grant it father we commit ourselves to you afresh today in jesus name now lord deal with hearts water the seed of the gospel that that's all i can do lord my part is finished in a minute i'll step away from this sacred desk we'll sing songs and offer praise and it'll be up to you lord to anchor it it'd be up to you to water it you said i planted it i'll water it i'll water it
