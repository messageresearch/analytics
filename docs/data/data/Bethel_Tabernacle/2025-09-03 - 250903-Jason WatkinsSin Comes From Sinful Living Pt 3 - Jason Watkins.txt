========================================

[Music] I am the clay. [Music] Mold me and make me after thy will. While I am waiting, [Music] yielded and still. Could you just stand? Would you just sing that with all of our heart? Oh, have thy own way, Lord. have thy own way. Thou are the father and I am the clay. Hold me and make me after thy will while I wait. healing and still. Would &gt;&gt; you just turn with me in your Bibles to the book of Psalms, Psalms 33, is going to read verses 1-9. It says, "Rejoice in the Lord, oh ye righteous, for praise is comely for the upright. Praise the Lord with harp. Sing unto him with the sultry and an instrument of 10 strings. Sing unto him a new song. Play skillfully with a loud noise. For the Lord for the word of the Lord is right, and all his works are done in truth. He loveth righteousness and judgment, and the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. Aren't you glad for that? Amen. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. To this day that still shocks me that he just spoke, right? And he created everything. Think about that. He gatherth the waters of the sea together as a heap. He layeth up the depth in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the Lord. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in all of him. For he spake and it was done. He commanded and it stood fast. Let's just bow our heads, have a word of prayer. Almighty God, it's always a privilege and an honor, Lord, to be able to come before your throne, Lord. Yet another service, Lord. Another Wednesday night. We're here in your house bringing our vocal cords, Lord, and our hearts and our Lord, our songs of praise unto you to sing of the goodness of God to speak of our great King, the lover of our souls and the giver of life. Thank you, dear God, for all that you do for us, Lord. Wednesdays. Sometimes we come in here and we're a little tired, Lord, and the devil plays with our mind and sometimes it's hard to focus, Lord, and just get ourselves out of the way. I pray tonight, Lord, is a special night. Lord, may it be a special Wednesday night, Lord. May you just touch our hearts, Lord. Help us to be open to receive whatever you have in store for us, Lord. And may the desires of our heart be to leave better people tonight as we hear your words. May it sink down into the depths of our heart, the depths of our soul. In that wonderful name of Jesus Christ, the congregation says, "Amen. Have thy own way, Lord." Oh yes. will have thy own way, Lord. Oh, have thy own. I the potter and I am the clay. [Music] Oh, mold me and make me. after thy will while I am waiting, yielding and still. Can we give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight? Amen. Brother Luther, why don't you come on up and we'll just pray over the tithes and the offerings first. Amen. Are you under expectation tonight to hear from the supernatural? Amen.

They took all the young people. I never seen a volleyball place like this. Looked like a you could park a 747. It looked like a aircraft hanger. And uh it was just lined with rows and rows of volleyball courts. And they had rented the whole shooting match. And all them young people was in there having a good time, 150 or so of them. And we got out of there and I said, "Brother Matt, you know, we're this Matt McGary." I said, "We're going to um maybe just grab one of them pizzas and take it back. We don't got a" and and that's when I got that McGary stare. I called it. Amen. where he just like went blank like and I realized what that look was was that's not how we operate out of here. Amen.

Praise God. I I thought I'm going to come back and I'm going to tell Sister Joy I am a vegetarian beginning today. Amen. I think I probably ate a half a cow while I was out there. And uh if you doubt that, ask Brother Matt. He will back that story up. Amen. Joel chapter 2. Want to continue on um from Sunday. I think they've they titled it. I'm going to change that title a little bit. You know what, Z? I tell you what, honey. I told you part three, but actually I'm going to change Sunday to three. So, let's We'll let dad fix it. Don't We'll fix it in post. Amen. Tonight, it'll actually be part four. Amen. I meant to title that last uh or Sunday before last. Praise God. I sure enjoyed that, Brother Caleb. I got a chance to uh see that service and and uh I was uh I I told Brother Matt, I was listening to it on the plane. I said, "My goodness, this young man's jumping all over the place." I said, "We he he could take our opening night at youth camp with this kind of preaching." Amen. And I haven't got a chance to hear the Sunday school yet, but I've heard it's quite amazing. Amen. So, we're looking forward to that. I enjoy the ministry we have here. I think we got some of the best. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Joel 2:20, Joel chapter 2, and we will um just going to read down a few verses uh beginning at verse 23. We're going to preach a little bit. We got some prayer requests to take up. Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God. For he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil. and I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palm worm my great army which I sent among you. Ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed. And I love this 27th verse. and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed. So the only way you're going to know who you are and the Lord is going to be in our midst and you will never have to be uh you know getting left holding the bag. You'll never be ashamed. You'll you'll have the Lord's presence and there will be a a complete unveiling of the mighty God all at the end time when the former and latter rain comes together in the same month and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a fresh surge at the end time. Amen friends. So anybody you know who wouldn't want to have a Holy Ghost baptism like Peter referred to here, I can't imagine why you'd want that gone because that's what identifies the presence of God. the ministry of the son of man. You know why that's true? Because that's what it identified in Acts two. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It identified the presence of the son of man. It identified that ministry in the church. Amen. Which is the word made flesh. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word now. And I ask for your blessing as we venture forth. Lord, give us hearing hearts tonight to hear your word. We commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You can be seated. So, we were covering the last time and I just want to make one or two quick points from two Sundays ago. We found that when brother Brandham talks about this day the scriptures fulfilled and he references now Luke chapter 4 and and and we find that's where of course Jesus is is taking the scrolls and saying you know and he's reading from Isaiah's prophecy uh the Lord God um the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor goes on down bind up the brokenhearted deliverance to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind is set at liberty, them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And from there he says, "This day this scripture is fulfilled." Then when you go uh to uh to brother Brandham in a in another sermon, he takes where Jesus is coming riding in uh in in fulfillment of prophecy. And so in one in the first instance in the temple, he is identifying himself as the fulfillment of prophecy. But when he comes riding in, he's not just announcing something. He's actually embodying it. And that was a big point that you understand because the whole purpose of the gospel and I might I'm going to get ahead of myself to say this, but you know, you can you can come upon a a pond of water and everything is still. And if you take a rock and you toss it out into the middle, you'll get those like concentric rings that just go outward in ripples and they just go on and on and on all the way to the shore in all directions all at the same time. And we find that that's exactly how the gospel was to go forth. That Jesus said, "You'll first be a witness in Jerusalem, then in Judea, Samaria, the uttermost part of the earth." So, it's like rings going out until it finally will cover the whole earth. And after 2,000 years of church history, and Jesus prophesies, when this gospel is preached in all the world, that's when the end will come. Now we are we know we can see why it would take when we say there were seven ages and at the last age you had the return of the ministry of the son of man. You not only had the office you had a prophet but you had the ministry of the son of man which would be the fullness of the word living in a people. And because that's the gospel that Jesus was referring to. Jesus said when this gospel &gt;&gt; which gospel what was he? He was the word made flesh. When the word in its fullness is living behind skin, when that gospel repeats again at the end time, that's when the end will come. And so it was after the seed would go into the ground after seven ages and at the end of the seventh age that ministry of the word made flesh would appear again. And it's the exact same principle. We can stand up today and announce this day this scripture is fulfilled. Not just in words, but now comes the allimp important part where we actually live it, where it's actually actionable action in our lives. And so we're not just declaring fulfillment, we are embodying fulfillment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does that blow your fuses? &gt;&gt; You understand that? So, so we're actually publicly embodying that prophecy when that Jesus spoke of. So, we found out last time we had another example that we gave you. We found where the Apostle Paul uh it goes back and pick and picking up a reference out of Isaiah 59 where he he he he put upon himself righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head. And then he goes and then right after that he's going to start going into judgment. He's he's covered in zeal and vengeance. So we know that right before the tribulation, we can see in the scripture that right before the tribulation of judgment when he goes forth judging, he will appear in his body. And as Paul picks it up when he he points back to it in Ephesians 6, that we are to have on the breastplate of righteousness that we are to have a helmet of salvation. We are to take. So the prophecy that is in Isaiah 59 would be a fulfillment. it would be embodied in his church all down through the ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when that has happened again, there's the there's another one. When you see the word embodied all the way down through the ages after the seed has went in the ground after it went all the way into dark ages after it came back up to a complete restoration just like Joel prophesied then then now once again the ministry is upon a people who have on the breastplate of righteousness who have a helmet of salvation who also because now it's not just Isaiah 59 now it's in it's it's in Ephesians 6 because now it's under the Holy Ghost era So it not only has a helmet of salvation, it has a sword of the spirit. It has it has a shield of faith. It has a preparation. Your feet shot with a preparation of the gospel. We have the full measure, the full gospel &gt;&gt; right here at the end time right before the tribulation strikes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it it should not surprise you &gt;&gt; when the ministry comes forward and said we need to be living the word of God. it because remember that Jesus didn't just declare it with his lips. He actually embodied it &gt;&gt; and got on the animal and rode him into Jerusalem. So it was more than just us saying God sent a messenger. Well, what was the message? Christ. How so? Because that's his word. Well, then what does that do for you? Makes me the word made flesh. That's the That's the point. That's what it's supposed to do. Friends, do you understand that? Just by these two points alone, all I've done is tie together these prophecies and you can know of assurityity that you are right near the door of a body change. We have lived out all the ages and we're just now ready to take a flight to the skies. There was nothing between Christ and his people putting on the helmet of salvation and the breastplate of righteousness. There was nothing after that except the tribulation. There's nothing sandwiched in between there. And so when you see that in its fulfillment today, I'm here to tell you there's not another age coming. There's no more messengers coming. You are the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense to you? Yes. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So, it's urgent. No wonder that the ministry uh is constantly urging us forward in our walk. &gt;&gt; We can't just have lip service. Jesus didn't stop that. I don't if you leave here tonight, don't forget that he didn't just stop declaring that he was the prophecy fulfilled with his lips. He actually went on and got on an animal and wrote it in embodying the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Why would he do that? Because that was the prophecy to follow the ministry that bound up the brokenhearted, the ministry that preached to sinners, the ministry that opened blinded eyes. That was to follow it. God hasn't given us a message to entertain us. He's given us a message to be embodied so that our life goes forward. And your the final voice is a declared voice in the lives of the people. &gt;&gt; And that the next stage after that is the voice of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I just wanted to seal that up in your heart because now when brother Brandham goes to the former and latter reign, oh my, he's he's gripped with with how much he he he shows the parallels and he ties it back into the scripture. Makes it very clear this is the day when this is supposed to happen. And so the that there there there would come a time where people are stumbling in gross darkness. And brother Brandham covers this. If you go back, I would recommend it's an excellent tape if you want to listen to one. It's uh March 3, 1960. And brother Brandham, you know, he he's tying together all of these scriptures to show us where we are. And he and but he's not just he's not just naming it prophecy like Jesus was naming prophecy. this day it's fulfilled in your ears. The words you just heard are fulfilled. But now a church that is supposed to be showing &gt;&gt; the prophecy. They're supposed to be demonstrating the word of the prophecy, but yet they're stumbling in gross darkness. And and brother Brandham deals with this how that it's a people who calling who actually call themselves Christians and yet the women are dressing immorally. The men are smoking and drinking and and cocktail parties and they're and the women are wearing shorts and bobbing their hair and all kinds of makeup. And brother Brandham is say is brother Brandham is showing that this is the hour where there's two stark realities. One is gross darkness and the other is the perfect sunshining. &gt;&gt; One is a famine for hearing the word and the other is floors full of wheat. I I already know what camp I want to be in and there ain't no in between camp. &gt;&gt; He he he talks about how that living sin, you know, sinful living, it produces spiritual blindness. Brother Brandham deals with that. We've been taking this title that, you know, about, you know, sin, sinful living brings forth sin. And we're we're continuing on it tonight. And brother Brandham actually zeros in on how that sinful living, catch this now, sinful living produces blindness. And the problem, the real problem with with blindness is you are it prevents you from having discernment in the time when if you were ever going to need discernment, it's now. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're raising your families in the darkest, most treacherous, most wicked, most perverted, most upside down, inside out. Humanity has never known the level of sin and corruption. If if fathers and mothers ever needed spiritual discernment, it's now. You can't afford to let your lifestyle blind your senses &gt;&gt; of what you see going on around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It signals that the age, the darkness actually signals the age and where we are in the scripture. And it speaks of how that people would have their sensitivity to the not only the word but to what's actually going on around them and their sensitivity would be dulled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that it and it's and it's so bad according to Bible prophecy, it's so bad that society as a whole, we're talking global, we're not just talking North America, &gt;&gt; society, global society, governments, courts, schools, business, &gt;&gt; finance, social, the social fabric, entertainments, recreation, church services, home life that everything people would actually lose the ability to discern between right and wrong &gt;&gt; so that they would look at things that society for thousands of years saw as wrong and dangerous and say there's no danger it's all good and we're all just being and and you just need to let everybody be who they are and brother Brandham said they say oh you're an old fogy uh William Brandom you you and he says you you remember this someday friends you'll hear you'll hear this voice for the last time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember a conversation I had with Billy Paul before some years before he passed away and I was curious about the the testimony brother Brandham tells about how that Billy had a dream. He said Billy doesn't dream uh very often at all. I think it came through brother Brown's mother said he doesn't dream very often and so when he does then he says it's usually something spiritual from the Lord and Billy tells the dream how that that you know there was chaos in the world and things were you know exploding and it was just a violent situation I forget I haven't looked at it in a while but the point I was curious about and wanted to know I said but but brother Brandham tells and I'm talking to brother Billy Paul and I said, he says that in the dream that that you were in church and that and Billy, brother Billy told me, he said, "I was in church and he says, "Dad, come in." And he says fire was flying from his eyes. You can find the quote, "Fire flying from the eyes or something like that." And he says, "It's time to go, Billy." And when he said, "It's time to go," then Ma screamed out, "What about Sarah?" Sarah's a 14-year-old girl. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who was already starting to show signs of rebellion. And she says, "What about Sarah?" And he said, "Daddy just looked very stern and said, she's heard. It's time to go." &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something, friends. It's time to go. &gt;&gt; It's definitely not time to be moving into rebellion. It's definitely not a time to be getting cool on the Lord. It's not a time to be getting distant from the Holy Spirit. Your redemption drawth nigh. It's time to go. It's time to be serious about this. &gt;&gt; So he, brother Ben Brandon, spends that whole sermon tying all of that together. And he comes and I read it for you last time. Oh, let every one of us us be overcomers. See, he wanted to he he he wanted to he said we've got to be overcomers so that so that Christ can live inside of us. And I don't want to I don't want to get slowed down reading reading that whole quote. I read I read this one for you and I'm only going to take these two points in choosing of a bride. He's giving that same straight warning. He says it we should straighten up our lives. &gt;&gt; Things that we have done. Let me advise you as a minister. If you believe me to be God's prophet, you listen to what I've told you. If there's one little tinkle of feeling in your heart, you go to God right now. &gt;&gt; See, and he says Paul and it goes into the rapture. Paul said, "When I was a child, I spake as a child. Thought as a child, you act as a child, but you grow older. You begin from making your first steps, toddle and fall and get up and try it again. Then after a while, you get so you can walk a straight line." He said, "That's what we have to do as soldiers of the cross. Now is time to walk a straight line right down that highway to glory. That's the highway I want to be on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we when we um let me just read this. I think they're busy getting something prepared for me. I'm just going to read you this from second Timothy chapter 2. Paul says um the servant of the Lord must not strive be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God per adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth here's an important verse that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive those words who are taken captive by him at his will so that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will. I you know I I I think that I could speak for us all tonight when we would and I don't need a show of hands and this is not we're not setting up a confessional booth but I think we could all agree that there have been times where we were left astonished that Satan just so easily took control of us and we found ourselves over here going what in the world am I doing &gt;&gt; back over here my goodness Lord I'm a Christian I'm a believer and that's true and you really are but I'm here to tell you friends He goeth about like a roaring lion. He This is a dark age and you cannot afford to let your life slip into the edges of carnality because it's a slippery slope that will only take you further and further away from God. &gt;&gt; And this is not the hour for that to happen. This is in fact the plight of too many of God's four ordained children. I'm I'm giving it to you that you're for ordained, &gt;&gt; you know. Um you know, and and and that but but because you are for you say, "Well, I'm for ordained." Okay, great. For ordained to do what? &gt;&gt; Well, to make heaven. Okay, great. But what do you that's then? What about now? Well, I'm supposed to believe. Yeah, you better. But what does that mean? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, don't put it off in the misty blue. Don't put it off, you know, and say, "Well, I I can't be lost. I was in it. I was in it." Yeah, that's all that's all correct. I'm predestinated not to fall. That's all correct. But what is my mission right now? I'm predestinated to be fighting on the front lines in God's army. I'm not supposed to be sitting back thankful that I can't be lost. If I'm if I really am that person, then I'm going to want to be able to say, "Give me a sword of the spirit. Give me a shield of faith. Give me a helmet of salvation. Yes. &gt;&gt; To many of God's four ordained children who are supposed to be fighting on the front lines, and I almost use this for a text tonight, the story of Samson, because we're supposed to be fighting on the front lines, but too many of God's four ordained children, &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm giving. I'm granting that too many of God's elect lady, too many of God's chosen vessels find themselves like Samson being taken captive by the very enemy that you're supposed to destroy. &gt;&gt; God help us all. God help me. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the plight of too many of God's four ordained children. That's the plight of too many parents. And I and and I I I I so hate the devil. I I don't want to see any more parents have to sit and cry and watch their teenagers drift off, drift off, drift off, and finally break away and roll off into the world. I I want to see the young people full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I want to see parents that care enough to do whatever is necessary to make sure their children are in church and hearing tapes and reading their Bible and having fellowship. I cannot imagine that a parent who says they love their child does not does not lay aside every weight and sin and run the race fervently with zeal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I cannot see that parents who constantly allow careers and job and school keep them out of church, keep their kids out of church and and and have no problem getting them to all the social events and all the recreational events, but come to the house of God. Sorry, we can't make it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's not in my notes. That one's free. You can have it. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of seeing that happen. Teenagers captured by the enemy. It's bad enough if if you were vigilant and as a parent and and you tried to always secure the borders of your family, but it's uh it's way more painful if you didn't. And then you see that to see those loved ones carried about by every wind of doctrine and don't think they won't be. &gt;&gt; To see those you love taken by every snare of the devil when they are, as the scripture said, taken captive by him at his will. But I'm just glad tonight there's another power greater than that power. I'm glad I'm connected to a greater power. I'm glad I got someone who can fix the problems, who can make up the shortfall, and who can go after my family. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't get the last word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Unless you give it to him. &gt;&gt; I say don't give it to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I There's one who who can save them according to his promise if I'll believe it. &gt;&gt; See, say, "Oh, well, I believe it." Well, Real believing. You might believe something's true, but real believing is when you're willing. When you're willing, when you're willing to hear, recognize, and act upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's when God will do the impossible part. Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; as I've been saying to you, sinful transgressions come from living in sinful ways. You you you don't in you don't intend to get fleas when you slept near a feral dog. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's what happens. &gt;&gt; Feral dogs get fleas. That wasn't your intention to get fleas, but that's what happens. You see, and I I I want you to understand tonight, you know, pharaoh means like it was a domesticated animal that got free and went into the wilderness and became pharaoh. Became wild. &gt;&gt; Hogs get out of hogs break out from farmers and they're they're domesticated. They break out and go into the wilderness. You never see them again. They go wild. Dogs do that. Cats do that. They become feral. And I the reason I'm bringing that up tonight is I want to make you aware of something. I'm sure you know it, but I hope you I hope that this language will prick your conscience. Uh, you see, there is such a thing as feral spirits from the underworld. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They roam the earth looking for friendly lodging. They're really they're feral angels really is what they are. &gt;&gt; And just like feral hogs or any domesticated animal, they escaped into the wild. They became feral. They are feral angels who once walked proudly. These these demon spirits, let me just put it in plain language. These demons are feral angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That used to walk the grandeur and the beautiful shores of heaven. &gt;&gt; They used to walk in and out of the temple of God. They used to worship God. These demons &gt;&gt; that are controlling the world, that are sucking the life out of your children. &gt;&gt; They are feral angels &gt;&gt; that used to know the pleasures of walking and serving God. But they fell for the lie of Lucifer and they joined his rebellion and they became fallen angels. Isaiah 14:12. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations? That's Isaiah 14:12. You talk about regretting &gt;&gt; that you hung out with the wrong crowd. I wonder if those fallen angels when they realized they'd lost the the war, &gt;&gt; they'd been kicked out, they'd been cast down into hell and hell got created as a prison for the devil and his angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These now feral angels, these demons who used to walk the wonderful streets of glory and they fell for Satan's lie. I wonder if they ever asked themselves that question. How did I ever allow myself to fall for his lie? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only that only to realize there was no way back for them. &gt;&gt; And they're reserved in chains of darkness according to the Bible, waiting for the day of judgment. You're talking about regretting the crowd that you hung out with. Think of think of it, friends. Think about this. I I thought to myself, you know, the the in the trail of the serpent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, brother Brandham tracks the trail of the serpent from Isaiah 14 where he is the son of the morning. And how precipitous is is the fall? How far? &gt;&gt; Ask yourselves tonight, and I'm not going to give you the answer. I want you to imagine it in your own mind. How far is it in the trail of the serpent? How do you go from being the son of the morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your right hand to the throne. You stand on the right side of God Almighty. &gt;&gt; You're the son of the morning, the most beautiful angel. You're you're an archangel. How do you go from this being the son of the morning and plunging all the way down to all of the depravity that we know now as the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That fall is nearly immeasurable in my mind, if not completely so. And I will assure you tonight that that same Lucifer has an immeasurable amount of failure lined up for you if you follow him. &gt;&gt; There is no limit. I will assure you, he has no limit. There's no limit to the depths. Hear me. There is no limit to the depths that he will take you. And he'll get you dabbling with this and dabbling with that. And you won't be two or three moons later and you'll be entrenched in it. Break free, friends. Your eagles. Fly away from that kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; Sinful lifestyle brings sin. Carnal lifestyle makes you weak. &gt;&gt; As far as you will allow him to take you. And I give you my word, it's further than you can imagine. Find anybody on Skidro will tell you that they didn't start out life on Skidro. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They started out in their right mind. Innocent child. Somehow they got imprinted. so imprinted with the world, they've lost all hope and live in squalor. I want to say this to you. These Pharaoh angels, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These demons, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; they will camp as close as you will allow them. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Their goal is to surround you, &gt;&gt; inhabit you, permeate every aspect of your life, and and they're they actually are desiring. What you don't realize is they're not just desiring to make you fall &gt;&gt; so they can laugh at you. Their design and their desire is to express themselves, &gt;&gt; but they need a body. They can't express themselves as human beings. They have to have a body. Brother Brandon would say a devil is almost powerless unless he can get somebody to work through. And you can see that you can see it on people. You can people don't realize that that that that they are actually is I mean it it literally affects their appearance, &gt;&gt; their garments, their language, &gt;&gt; where they go, what they do. And those people think, "Oh, I don't want anything to do with God. I like my freedom." You have no freedom. You are a complete prisoner to demons inside you who are the reason you dress like that and act like that and look like that and talk like that and parade around like that &gt;&gt; is because you've got a demon spirit who's expressing his life through you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See this was this was what see Satan the problem was remember this goes back to creation. Satan couldn't create &gt;&gt; he couldn't do like God. He couldn't create his own. So, so the whole process is is to take God's created humans and and indwell them so that they can ju just like God wants to be embodied in his church, Satan wants to be embodied in his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you have uncommitted churches uncommitted to the straight laced gospel, &gt;&gt; Amen. When you have un unspiritual homes, &gt;&gt; when you have non nonfervent supposed to be Christians, this is where these Pharaoh angels find their greatest access. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it again. Uncommitted churches, unspiritual homes, nonfervent humans, and that are supposed to be full of the Holy Spirit. This is where the these feral angels find their greatest access. How art thou fallen from heaven. Oh Lucifer, son of the morning. Listen, friend, I it's not it's not unheard of for sons of God's family to hear a question like that. Only it's not how art thou fallen, but it's Adam, where art thou? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham says in this sermon here, and I'm brother Matt's going to play a clip for me from having conferences. Brother Brandham says how he he ran up and down the garden. Adam, Adam. And I I thought I'll just I'll just memorize how he inflects and I'll say it and I listen to it fresh. And I said, I could never capture the prophet's urgency. And I want you to listen to it with me now. Go ahead, son. When God knew that that shocking state of emergency, I suppose the first ever came to heaven was when he heard that his children was lost. And he came frantically up and down through the garden. He went, looking under every bush. Adam. Oh my son Adam, where art thou? There stood Adam and Eve with their fig leaves sewed together behind the bush. Father going back and forth screaming, "Where are you? Where are you?" That same God goes up and down the aisles, night after night, screaming the same thing. Where art thou? Where art thou? &gt;&gt; Where art thou? Where art thou? &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; That's the cry of the Holy Spirit of a creed that they have or denomination there. There are &gt;&gt; So if you caught that when he says the father going back and forth screaming, "Where are you? Where are you?" See, it wasn't just where are you? Where are you? It's where are you? Where are you? It's it's it's not just God saying, "Oh, I can't find you, son. I have no idea. I know I'm God, but I have no idea where you actually are." God knew right where they are. The cry is not, "I can't find you, Adam." The cry is, "Adam, where are you? How did you get this? How did you get into this condition? I gave you a perfect world. I gave you my word. I visited you every day. Where are you? Where are you? &gt;&gt; Oh, let me say tonight, friends, where are you? You might not be hearing, "Oh, how art thou fallen from heaven, Lucifer, son of the morning." But God's family is hearing tonight. Where are you? Where are you? Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad that when that voice came, it was not a prophet like Isaiah indicting me, but it was my heavenly father running up and down the avenues of my life saying, "Son, oh son, where are you, my son?" &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that when the cry came out, I had a way back. Hallelujah, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That same God up and down the aisles night after night screaming the same thing. Where art thou? Where art thou? &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's through individuals, individual people, individual families &gt;&gt; and through their churches and through the churches of and churches are just collections of families. &gt;&gt; And families are groupings of people. And so it's individuals make up families. Families make up churches. And God has ordained that to spread the gospel around the world. God has ordained that this is how his kingdom flourishes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when when there is no flourishing of the life of God, &gt;&gt; coming from your home, is that God's fault? Don't even say it's the devil's fault. &gt;&gt; You have to just say, "Lord God, have mercy on me." Yes. &gt;&gt; When we don't see a church with the signs and wonders and the power of God and miracles to cast out devils, not even by laying on of hands, just preaching the gospel. I'm going to tell you something, friends. If I thought that this gospel couldn't cast out devils, I'd have hung it up a long time ago and become a psychologist. But I've seen what this gospel can do. I've seen that it casts out devils and it it heals the sick and it raises the dead and it opens blinded eyes both natural and spiritual. I've seen these things happen. I've seen young people bound get free. I've seen old people bound get free. I've seen the Holy Ghost while I was preaching &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost falling upon them and then and then with the gifts added to the church and laying on of hands and anointing with oil and the prayer of faith. How why would we want to be a powerless church? I have nothing to do with a powerless church. I want a church that's sold out. I want families that are sold out. I want to see the power of God moving. And I want to see the devil running. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastors, parents, individuals hear this warning friends. pastors, preachers, parents, individuals themselves. They they open up their most prized possessions to spiritual torture and spiritual grief when they let down the bars in their churches, &gt;&gt; in their homes or in their lives. When ministry, when parents or when individuals don't take a fervent stand, then there's no way to stop the devil. When he comes in like a flood and come in like a flood, he shall. &gt;&gt; Oh my friends, when he goes about seeking whom he may devour, but neither ministry nor parents nor individuals will take a fervent stand, then who will be there to stand in the gap and say, "Thus far and no further." &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not a kind of family or a kind of a church or the kind of person I want to be. I want to know that the authority of the almighty God flows through me. &gt;&gt; It's not power for the sake of power. The way up is always down. &gt;&gt; It's humbling yourself to the word of God. &gt;&gt; I think about how many homes and how many lives and how many whole churches whole churches &gt;&gt; have been swept aside by the enemy, driven off the battlefield and vanquished completely blown to pieces. families that that worshiped together and sat in church and cried and worshiped God and raised hands today blown to smitherines. &gt;&gt; Parents in every direction, children in every direction and that happens to whole churches. I think about Life Tabernacle and how many times brother Brandon went there and and and they're in Louisiana and shreport Life Tabernacle. some of the most fantastic miracles and things that happen there. &gt;&gt; And and yet you go there today and it's just a it's just a a dead morg of a so-called church. There's no life of the word there. There's no life and liberty there. and the and the and the old place where right across the street where brother Brandham was right in that area holding meetings and now it's a museum to the king of rock and roll &gt;&gt; and you literally can walk out of the parking lot as I remember it from life tabernacle and look and there's a there's a big larger than life statue of a modernday Judas's scariot &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you why did that happen because that church rejected the message of the hour &gt;&gt; and it blown to blew to pieces is I don't that's not going to be my my plight. I don't want that to be your plight. I want this to be a shining beacon on a hill. I want that when the Lord comes, he'll find the liberty that he has among our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think about life tabernacle. I think about other other churches that I've known and oh, but that's not the end of the story. And let me say it like this. That's not the word for the bride. The word for the bride is thy floors shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon when he went beyond the curtain of time, that iconic moment when he heard that voice and the whole thing is starting to fade from view and one of the last things right before he has to go back that he hears all that you ever loved. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And all that ever loved you, God has given you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to tell you something, friends. It's true. There is a way that seemth right to a man, and the end thereof is destruction. But thank God, there is a true way that we can live in. There is a true path that you can walk on. And and and you can be a real standard. You can be you can you can be a real standard raised up to stop Satan in his tracks. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I vote for stopping him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I vote for stopping him. &gt;&gt; How many vote with me? &gt;&gt; I vote for stopping him in his tracks. &gt;&gt; Revelation 16. He hath made us not failures and peasants. &gt;&gt; He hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father. I'm here to tell you God has placed the full await and authority of all of heaven into the hands of his redeemed family so that all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you can walk in the freedom of the Holy Spirit. He's raised you up so that all that ever loved you and all that you ever loved can breathe free air, can breathe a Holy Spirit. I'm so glad tonight that we have a bomb in Gilead and it has it is a cure for any disease, spiritual, sickness, emotional, financial, it doesn't matter what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All that I ever loved and all that ever loved me can soar into the heavenly atmospheres. That's what I want. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want all that I ever love to be able to soar into the joys of the Lord every day, today, tomorrow, for the rest of their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not an imaginary freedom. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Not somewhere over a rainbow. &gt;&gt; But right now, &gt;&gt; I believe he's a right now God. &gt;&gt; How many believe? How many accept he's a right now God? &gt;&gt; See, I want a right now God. &gt;&gt; And the floors shall be full of wheat. I got nine, eight and a half minutes. And the floors shall be full of wheat. The fat shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten. The canker worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm, my great army which I sent among you. See, &gt;&gt; this actually identifies the tactics of the devil in this scripture because notice how he says, "I'm going to restore in stages what was taken from you &gt;&gt; in stages." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this is exactly the tactic of the enemy. He slowly cuts off your ferveny. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham dealt with this in in restoration of the bride tree. That's another good one. Go listen to it. It started out the tree was blossoming. Fruit was in the top. The church was ripening on toward the rapture. I get the seed had to go into the ground. I understand that. &gt;&gt; Uh but but then it takes away the fruits and then it takes away the leaves and then it take and and then it starts getting into the bark and it gets all the way down to the root. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so he's going to restore that bride tree back to where the last thing before the rapture is the fruit is ripening in the top of the tree again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's where we are, friends. Not another stage. &gt;&gt; The the next stage above fruit ripening in the top of the tree. You'd have to fly. And that's what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; but slowly over time, I just want to deal with that before we close because I I I want to make this point to you and really get it in good in case this is my third and or third or fourth and final installment of this little little thought that's I thought it was a little thought and here I am four parts of it. It's just burning my heart up. But let me just speak to you about something that you'll know is reality. I won't even have to talk very much about it. You're well acquainted with the trial after trial. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hardship after hardship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan just piling on, piling on. Starts to cut off our ferveny. Starts to cut off our zeal. Starts to cut off our fellowship. Starts to suddenly you're not reading your Bible like you used to. And even when you do, you don't enjoy it as much anymore. Those those prayers are getting shorter and shorter and fewer and further in between &gt;&gt; and Satan is piling onto our lives the weariness of mind that accumulates. This is his tactic. &gt;&gt; And he just a little here and a little there and a little here. And it doesn't seem like much to you because it's just little installments until you get way over here and you're three or four levels down the mountain where you used to be. How did I get down here? You were you were every day reaching for a higher handhold and pulling yourself up higher on the mountain. And now you find you're looking up at your own trail. There's where I used to be. You think that the devil isn't a master at that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Slowly over time, trial after trial, hardship after hardship, rejection after rejection, it begins to accumulate. And year after year, he takes and he takes and he takes. But I I want to I want to give you this tonight. Everything that Satan has taken from us, this message was sent to give it back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your peace that passes understanding, &gt;&gt; the joy of the Lord, the oil of gladness, the wine of stimulation. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you something, friends. This message of the son of man has come to restore. I will restore all the years everything that Satan ever took from me. Uh all the years that Satan now uses to plague your faith and to steal your joy and rob you of all the redemptive blessings that God intends for you and died for you to enjoy. I'm here to tell you this message is giving it back. It's restoring the message. The me listen friend let me let me say this to young young young teenagers because the devil tells you oh if I serve God I got to give up this I got to give up that I can't do this I can't do that. The message does not come to take things from you. The message comes to set you free and give you all the most valuable things. The only things that's keeping you from are the things that are killing you. And he he because you God wants you to have life and liberty in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It comes to restore. It doesn't come to destroy my life. The The message doesn't come The message doesn't come to make me lose my children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message doesn't come to cut me off from my family because I've been a believer. That's not why it came. I'm here to tell you, you're in the age of restoration. And God is going to recover our children. And God is going to restore our families because we are believers. I hope you're a believer tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can take back. You don't have to have sickness to take you down to the grave in some sorrowful, slow defeat. I I'm here to tell you, yes, you say, "Well, people do die, right? To live for me to live is Christ, but to die is not loss. To die is gain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; you can take back your faith. &gt;&gt; You can take back your joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're you're already an elected child. &gt;&gt; You're already greatly loved. You're already highly favored. &gt;&gt; What does hinder you? &gt;&gt; What does hinder you? He Paul said, "Oh, you foolish Galatians. What hinders you?" Come on, Bethl Tabernacle. What does hinder you really? &gt;&gt; It's not God. It's not his word. Don't even go blaming the devil. It's me, not my brother, nor my sister, nor my pastor, nor my past, nor my failures, nor my family. It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. &gt;&gt; Reclaim your zeal. Reclaim your ferveny. Reclaim your fellowship with the Holy Spirit tonight. Stand to our feet all over the building. I say we reclaim everything that is rightly ours. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says, "Let him come into your life. Clean out all the flu." Come on, musicians. Clean out all the flu. Blow out all your channels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many want that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I think I said this to you last time and I enjoyed it so much I think I'm going to do it again. I told you, you want to try on a garment of the word? Here's a good one because it's literally the word. Create in me a clean heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, and renew a right spirit in me. Let's sing that, Brother Brad. Create in me a clean heart. Renew a right spirit in me. It's almost 8:30. Come on and gather. We got to get our prayer requests taken up here. Amen. Gather in close. Praise the Lord. Do you love him, friends? &gt;&gt; Oh, go much faster than that. Let's speed it up. Oh, oh, God. &gt;&gt; Oh, and renew a right spirit within me. &gt;&gt; Keep it going now. Create. Create. Oh, create in me a clean heart, [Music] oh God. Oh, and renew the right spirit within me. Cast me on singing. Oh, cast on me now. not away from from thy presence, oh Lord. Oh, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore, Lord. Restore unto me. Oh, the joy of thy salvation. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Oh, &gt;&gt; when renew the right spirit within me all together now. Come on, we know this song. Come on, help me sing it. Oh, create in me a clean heart. [Music] Oh God. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Oh, &gt;&gt; and renew the right spirit within me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Create in me a clean heart. Oh God. and renew the right spirit within me. Oh, sing cast me out away from thy presence. Oh Lord, all day long thy holy spirit from me and may restore unto me all the joy of thy salvation. Oh, and renew the right spirit within me. &gt;&gt; Brother Mark Lowry, we sent in a prayer request tomorrow morning. I have a big meeting with a potential client. This is a really big opportunity for brother Mark. And he said, "I I need the Lord's blessing." He said, "I" He told me personally, he said, "I need more than a normal blessing."

I was I was able to completely, Lord, evacuate my whole heart with that thought. I I feel like I've I've I've clenched it, Lord. The the nail should be clenched at this point, Lord. Lord, the people ought to know that that that carnal, edgy lifestyle, those sinful ways, all that does is multiply more failure in our lives. And you have called us to a higher standard. You've called us to be more than that, Lord. You've called us to rise up above the darkness of this evil age and shine forth the light of your glory. Shine forth the power of God. We are supposed to know you in your power and conjunction, your resurrection. Lord, I pray that you'll grant it to us tonight. We claim deliverance, Lord, and that you'll help in this time of trouble for this employee, the husband of this employee there, Lord. Don't know who he is, but you know who he is, Lord. And Father, his wife happens to work with believers who sent in a request and here we are praying and we're sending prayers to MUSC to that man. Lord, may you have mercy. I pray on the case. I pray Lord for brother Mark that you would bless him on this meeting with great abundance over above and beyond. Lord, how many times have I seen you come on the scene for me in these kind of situations? And you actually did more than I could even think to even ask you to do and you even did more than that. Father, I ask that it's such a blessing. Show this great kindness to your servant, Brother Mark. We commit it to you now. And all the hands that went up, Lord, all over the building, you see every need, Lord. Here's my hands again. Father, I have great needs in my life. I know of great needs in the lives of the saints here and I ask for your mercy for us, Lord. In coming days, may you help us, Lord God, to shine brighter and brighter, cleaning up, Lord, wiping off all the smuds from our lens that we might be a lighthouse. Oh, grant it to us, lamb of God.
