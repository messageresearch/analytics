[Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] everyone I bless you Let's uh let's go right to the scripture we're going to continue on the gene of God part six stand yeah Romans 9 13. as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated let's pray Heavenly Father we ask Lord that your Holy Spirit would come and take your word and break it open to our hearts Lord reveal yourself to us Lord we just want to commit this time lord and the Sunday school and the service into your hands for your glory Lord would you just create an atmosphere that the word would brood over your people Lord and enter into their hearts Lord by faith we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you and be seated so I know brother Jason announced that I was going to be preaching regular service but we switched that up a little bit I took Sunday school and my father-in-law and Brother Don Hoffman will be taking the regular service so just in case that was in your in your mind what and what he's going to preach and do Sunday school what's the deal here so continuing from last week I think we I felt like we made good progress last week getting to where I wanted to go to but I went really fast and there was a lot there so I want to really take the time to really establish more of the things that I said using scriptures and quotes um we had them there and I referred to them but we're going to use more this time so Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated kind of picking up from when I spoke about before right in the same family you have elect and non-elect right in the same family right from the same parents right from the same pool of genetics and as we talked about and we're gonna we're gonna look at this closely is that God took his life when he created Adam he put his life into Adam and and his life into Eve and God's desire and his purpose was to from them bring forth I'll call it the god race the seed predestinated seed of God so that this Earth would be filled with everyone who's made in God's image and likeness Satan came in Temptation against that purpose and injected that hybrid seed into the human race right then we fast forward as time goes on and we get to the the the era leading up to the flood says the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were Fair two seedlines Keynes line the daughters of men and uh Seth's line the sons of God right so Seth was the son of Adam Adam was the son of God so that life coming forward passing down to Seth but then it goes forward those two lines become hybrid and then we watch and see God says every thought and Imagination of the heart of a man's heart is evil continually I'm going to start over but then what was produced from Adam and ham Shem and japheth and their wives same thing directly to the Tower of Babel dictatorship false religion and so when we look at this the portion that becomes uh is the mystery I believe that God showed to brother Branham through who is this Melchizedek and some of the different sermons is that this this genetic life this life and even through the teaching his teaching on the Virgin birth that genetic life from God is to be passed down through the human race through mother and your mother and father and in one family you can have some children predestinated of God some that are not why because that Gene goes in there and as we looked at it can be dorm it can it can it can be a gene that's inactive so it's not the gene of God is inoperable then the next Generation raise up and it goes through and passed on and it's active right and so again I'm explaining it there's I have quotes behind all this and I want to I want to show you this but that's the portion that if you start to preach this in a denominational Church you'll get a boot out the place because they consider that this idea as complete nonsense complete fanaticism to to say that the genetic life but if because of that they twist the Trinity trinitarian into a trinitarian understanding to make Father Son and Holy Spirit three separate persons because they don't understand the how the life of God works and that to me probably the greatest Revelation that God brought to brother Branham was how the life of God operates and how it works and you see with serpent seed and then you see the necessity that there be a virgin birth why because everyone was tainted by that Serpentine nature every one of us are mixed hybrid right there in our body Soul and Spirit completely so then he has to bypass that totally and then they're the life of God is Born the very the very Son of God who was God himself why was he God himself because the very life of God was in that human body which had a beginning these things these things are are if if you're not amazed and stunned and in awe of them you're missing something because what brother Branham teaches is Inc is absolutely incredible earth-shattering stuff it really is so the word Genesis in the Greek translation uh is the word beginning in the beginning our term Gene it has the same same origin Gene is a unit of heredity which is transferred from a parent to offspring and is held to determine some characteristic of The Offspring Gene speaks of origin in connection with its characteristic our nature and characteristics come from our origin as we spoke about before every aspect of our being comes from our parents our genetic life what we are we're made up of DNA that DNA is what determines what we are that comes from our our parents and the the heretic hereditary line that we come from all is passed down there Body Soul and Spirit all of that and so we looked at this before dominant and recessive genes dominant refers to the relationship between two versions of a gene individuals receive two versions of each gene known as alleles from each parent if the alleles of a gene are different one allele will be expressed it is the dominant gene the effect of the other allele called recessive is mask and you can see that that is an explanation of why in one family why you have Jacob who is from the genes of God and Esau who is not right there in the same family and then you go on down years years and the gospel starts going to the Gentiles and then people from Esau's line begin to receive the Gospel Hebrews 7 5 and then we'll read nine and ten and verily they that are of the sons of Levi who received the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their Brethren though they come out of the loins of Abraham see there's the picture coming from the loins of Abraham and as I may so say Levi also who received tithes paid tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him so in in God's sight it's not just a you know there's there's there's there's DNA passed on and it's just generic and it's we don't know who's coming forth no God is literally looking at Abraham and say Levi is coming right David is coming etc etc down the line so it's not it's not as though it's some generic DNA but it's God molding and shaping something through that genetic line Ephesians 1 3 and 4 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according his he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love I think this is important to look at what does it mean that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world again are we looking at just an expression of thought is it is it merely a thought that we were there as a thought in him before the foundation of the world or is is it speaking something more than that that he had we were literally in him we our life was in him if was Levi just a thought in Abraham he wasn't even that right but he was genetically in Abraham Abraham didn't choose that Levi was going to be his grandson or anything he was just there right and so we are chosen in God so where were we our genetics our DNA was in God and what is that it's beyond just coding it's There's an actual life there's a substance there's something real that's that's there we were in him before the foundation of the world for all of eternity if if you catch that in the church ages book because God doesn't have new thoughts our thought the thoughts of God are Eternal they're unchanging we were there in him for all eternity as a part of his life no you didn't know it you weren't existing literally in Fellowship but your life was in him just like Levi's life was in Abraham now I want you to look at this from questions and answers on Genesis speaking about God's order he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God so now I want you to notice what he says the first creation was God himself this isn't saying God was created it's speaking the order of creation so God is first in order right God is first then out of God came the logos which was the son of God which the logos is not created either the logos is birth it's it was a part it was in God for all of eternity than just prior to Creation it comes forth as a birth out of God brother Branham says a part of God went out of God he didn't say the word was created he said a part of God went out of God that's significant because it's his life expressed uh then out of God came to logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us out of the logos came forth the man so you see this understanding is we're we're we're talking about the life so the life is coming forth the life of the word was in God the the life of Adam was in the word right so this life is coming forth it's coming out of him in unveiling of God says that's the way God did he bred this one to that one this one to that one to this one to that one until he got exactly what he wanted that's how he come down do you see that significance there he says he's got he's working in the very uh genetics of the human race to produce what he wants to produce is isn't that an incredible thought in our ancestors I mean he he was planning you and if the Lord Darius he's planning other Generations right in he he was all of this goes back thousands of years to this one married this one nothing happens by chance every God is totally Sovereign in everything that he does he's totally Sovereign in your family's parentage he's totally Sovereign and your grandparents great grandparent and and on and on Down the Line because he wanted to produce something you right we read this last week I'm going to read it again from the Rapture in the little literal discharge of the male there's somewhat a million germs comes forth a male at each time and somewhat a million eggs from the female at the same time but did you know in all of them little gerunds moving around a million of them then there's only one of them ordained to life and there's only one egg fertile and that little germ will call right up through every one of them other little germs right over the top of every germ looking just like him and come over the top of that and come over here and find that fertile egg and crawl into it and then all the rest of them die why talk about the Virgin birth oh it's not half as mysterious as a physical birth how it's foreordained predestinated by God you see what care what involvement God has in every aspect to produce that life there he looks even to the very spur proper sperm and proper egg to bring together and then he sets forward the DNA just the way he wants it so this is just referring to some uh putting together a few different quotes from last week this is from communion in their nature I was a sinner all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature presidency predestinated a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God then in another sermon he says now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains the flesh that's been interbred out to this boy so and in in that quote if you remember he's speaking about the nature of his Spirit right his attitude his his characteristics so that body Soul and Spirit all there is being passed down through that genetic line then the last quote he's a hybrid he's got to be born again you see that's the reason we have to be born again because that false Serpentine life has been injected into the human race and we have to be born again because our first birth is wrong Souls that are in prison now and the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us we are dead and our lives are hidden God through Christ sealed there by the Holy Spirit now it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's of the world and to keep reading we're going to put this together communion in their nature I was a sinner I came to the world a liar all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature present see predestinated was in there by God in the same body see two Natures in there continuing from communion pop and Mom they're gone on now to the rest of them days they were Sinners there was no Christianity in our homes at all and all my drinking and parties and carrying out on it made me sick I'd take my Lantern and my dog and go to the woods to stay all night in the wintertime I'd hunt till the party was over maybe daylight in the morning come here wouldn't be over I'd lay on the I've laid on top of a shed and sleep waiting for daylight to break what was it there was another William Branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working now then one day as I walked on that voice talking don't never smoke drink so forth and the young fellows and all got older see there was something moving but yet all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham there's something calling like my little Eagle I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great Jehovah whoever you are open up I want to come home amen there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow now that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered against me no more a seed now we stand Justified as though we had never sinned in the presence of God all right but inside of you this from leadership you've got a soul and that soul is the gene that come from God modern events made clear by prophecy but the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world now you see that connection that Soul was in God before the foundation of the world how did it get to you did it come directly from God to you we saw and read before no it comes through it passes through the human race the genetics of the human race you are born with that Gene from God inside of your soul and that what what does brother Branham say I think I have yeah so let me let me pause myself there for a second and read this scripture Romans 6 14 for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace you say what in the world does that have to do with anything I want you to understand we have two Natures I think I have this yeah so the soul is the nature of the spirit right we have two Natures in our soul there's a gene of God in our soul there's also Serpentine genetic in our soul as well those two Natures before the New Birth the serpentine nature in our soul dominates the gene of God right yet as we read from Brother Branham the gene of God is there somehow producing like a covered over desire for righteousness and for God see it's it's there brother Ben I'm telling that sore it was in there that Gene was in there working right but what is it it's under the Dominion of sin that's the condition we are before we're born again we are under the Dominion of sin so in that Soul there's two Natures one is dominating the other right well what does the new birth bring it flips that now the gene of God should be dominating the other one the word causes that the gene of God's influence to grow you understand the Bible says you're dead and your life is hid from God brother Madam said what is it that nature dies it dies but do you remember that you're battling against sin every single day you're fighting against sin every single day we have to Die daily in other words we're in a process right and that Gene of God is there and the domination when the new birth comes the Holy Ghost comes to us that domination flips over now the gene of God becomes dominant but not totally dominant when you're when you're a babe in Christ you have struggles you have difficulties you have things that you look back on and say what did I ever struggle with that for before why because you're you're a babe in Christ you're that Gene has to start growing brother Baron talks about watering it the life has to water it there's what is it we're Washed by the washing of the water of the word and that Holy Spirit Waters that also Waters that word so that Gene of God that seed of God so there's that watering process that grows that we have to grow and grow and grow and when you look when you're a newborn babe in Christ and you're struggling with many things you wonder why can't I get over this and then as as you keep feeding on the word and keep fellowshipping with with God in your in that jeans in your soul what happens the domination of the life of God per this begins to permeate your whole body until you're very until this very body is changed in this this very body becomes subject to the Rapture amen all right so that's overcoming the gene of God is overcoming the serpentine nature within us so so we went over this last week but I I think I went fast so I'm going to slow down a little bit I got through the major portion I wanted to get through um with a little bit of time left so all right looking back Kane derived his genetics from who the serpent only the serpent no The Serpent and Eve remember Adam could not be deceived he was in the original creation Eve was taken out of Adam was in the secondary creation brother random says it's a byproduct people hear that and they they take it as a negative thing like a hot dog is a byproduct of a pig that's not what brother Branham is saying that's the word that he chose to use he's saying he comes out of Adam she wasn't a leftover she wasn't in the second thoughts were you in the secondary thoughts of God no God's original purpose was Adam and Eve but he made her in the second second secondary creation as a byproduct so that she could be deceived because God had a purpose God had a purpose to to express himself to us so the jeans in the father and the mother of this boy Remains the flesh that's in her bread out to this boy so Abel and Seth genes of Adam and Eve if Eve can be deceived guess what her children can be deceived as well Genesis 6 2 we we talked about it before sons of God saw the daughters of men it's the SAS line and Cain's line coming in and hybriding together brother Branham says the sons of God saw the daughters of men and caused the sons of God to fall into delusion delusion speaks of being deceived in a blushing Prophet 1956 grieved the heart of God when he looked upon them in the days before the antelope antediluvian destruction that he ever made a man what happened the sons of God saw the daughters of men was fair it was perversion it was a sex mix-up it was that thing that drove the children of God from the Garden of Eden see there's that hybrid in the Fallen the flashing red light of the sign of his coming notice the women of that day in the days of Noah must have been the talk of the day see you sons of God Seth Seth's Sons saw the daughters of Cain that they were beautiful why they were Wicked and they were Daughters of Cain when the sons of God saw the daughters of men they were Fair they took unto them women and you remember if we talked about last week many people are teaching that Fallen Angels came down and pressed their bodies or their their spiritual bodies into into flesh and produced and and and took women and produced the Nephilim the Giants so they think that they they use this scripture which is it always makes me laugh they they condemn serpency Doctrine which has multitude of scriptures from Genesis to Revelation to demonstrate it uh they say how could that possibly be that's disgusting and then they fast forward five chapters and say that's how it is it's exactly like that and a spiritual being came down and had sex with women and produced Giants oh that's disgusting so we don't we don't uh base our Doctrine on whether it's disgusting or not we base it on the word and Jesus said Angels can't reproduce right otherwise they would be make you'd make Satan be a Creator and it wasn't Satan directly that joined with Eve it was the serpent he was a created Animal just like the man but without a soul right so we'll continue on Genesis 6 produced a mixed hybrid race God wanted to bring his family forth through Adam and Eve but through serpent seeds injection into Humanity first through Cain then through the daughters of men every one of us are hybrid I think that's clear from scripture you know you can fast forward and say well Noah was perfect in his Generations but that's absolutely true I believe Noah was the very last pure born son of Adam but what did his family line produce me a sinner you a sinner it's hybrid it's clear it's hype hamsham and japheth produced all hybrids the whole world is full of full of that and we saw in this read this last week but we'll repeat it John 8 37 I know that your Abraham's seed Sperma but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you so he says I know that you're physically from Abraham in verse 39 and this this helps us to understand serpent seed you know maybe not so much more but you used to hear people saying oh that one I know that he's serpent seed well do you know that you are you have that life in you too that's the mix-up is when we start thinking of there's these pure genetic lines and that's where many of the racist doctrines you see black nationalists say white people are serpent seed and you see white nationalists saying black people are serpent seed they're all ignoramuses is what they are they have no idea that the scripture because it very clearly shows we're all a mixed race so verse 39 they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus saith unto him if you were Abraham's tecton children tecton means sons that there's a relationship a bond a similar characteristic a similar nature if you had the same nature as Abraham you'd do the work of Abraham you worry of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do so here we see this there's a genetic line right that he's looking at and by election in the very same Nation there's Abraham's seed who are of the devil and there's Abraham's seed who are sons of Abraham and they have a place inside of them that can receive the word those who are Abraham's seed who are of the devil there's no place in them to receive the word they can't receive it it's impossible all right let's uh let's stand
