no room for the King of [Music] Kings room for others and for other things he'll just keep knocking till he hears you say no room room for houses L and [Music] Pleasures room for things that pass away but for the one who reigns forever there's no room [Music] today no room for the King of Kings room for others and for other [Music] things he'll just keep knocking till he hears you say no [Music] room the world was going to receive its greatest gift that had ever received a little package wrapped up a little first little Christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world God wrapped it up God made flesh in a package God who covers all space and time was before there was a world or a star molecule wrapped himself in a a little package and was laid in a Manger in a stable where the manures of the cattle and sheep and things up over that stable and in this little mangor on straw or hey Jehovah was laying there crying like a baby it wasn't handed to him in the custom that they were used to gifts being handed that's the reason it's rejected yet tonight amen is because it's not handed to the people in the custom amen that they have been used to receiving gifts they want it wrapped in the kind of goods that they want to wrap it in they want the tensil on it they want something flowly something that's perfumed something that's glittering something that's classic but God don't send it all the time like that amen he sends it in the power the way he wants to send it it wasn't wrapped in fine Linens it was wrapped in swalling claw which I'm taught that the very thing that Jesus is wrapped in the Christ was the uh stuff off the back of a yolk of an ox that was hanging in the stable they they had no clothes for him and they oh when I think of that it nearly breaks my heart no clothes for em Manu will the creator of heavens and earth another thing it was brought by the poor Mary and Joseph was very poor people they were peasants and because it was brought by the poor they didn't want it amen so is it today when this great gift of the church the Holy Spirit falls upon the poor and humble the rich don't want it they don't want to Humble themselves the churches today don't want a pastor filled with the Holy Ghost amen that AR Boy tell you what's right and wrong they don't want it they F him right quick Deacon board get together and turn him away get another and talk about their Creeds they got the church so wrapped up in these denominations till they can take a trusty border or Deacon board and turn a good pastor any way they want to they welcome their their friends and their politicians and so forth but they won't welcome Christ they'd rather have Santa Claus anytime worlds tuck over Santa Claus is tuck over well you don't little children don't even know no more What Christmas Means I wonder people don't know what to do they they just don't want the real thing they'll take anything artificial but they don't want the real thing they don't want the gifts of God they don't want Jesus that's one thing why was the reason they didn't receive this rap package they know what was on the inside of it and they didn't want it that's the reason the churches and people today and the governments and the lands will not receive God's Christmas present is because they know what's in it they don't want it amen amen it'll make women act different it make men act different you'll have to bear the name of a fanatic you'll have to take the way with the Lord's disp few you'll have to clean up your life you'll have to quit your meanus you'll have to stop doing wrong cheating stealing I'm committing adultery amen you'll have to stop these things and the people don't want it amen although they may know it's right but they don't want it it brings too much truth to them it uncovers their sins amen so therefore they don't want it they want nothing to do with it keep away from it that's the way it was in that day they know what was wrapped in it so they said away with it they don't want it it's the same thing [Music] today hello there hi I was wondering if I could interest you in this completely free Christmas gift Christmas gift it's not
