make a few announcements um after we read our scripture amen I would like to start out this morning by just thanking all of those who were made that possible yesterday that event and the wonderful support at the Christmas caroling the Gathering there and uh I had a secret agent sending me videos in real time and so uh amen praise the Lord I won't I won't call her name but her initials are Emily Curtis but but uh it was I felt like I was live streaming it and I was sitting there and and sister Debbie and she said did you see the latest one what is it oh my goodness so I just appreciated that I thought it was such a wonderful representation of our assembly and wonderful Outreach and I'd like to give a very special thanks uh to the entire Johnson family for spearheading that thing from the planning to the implementation to the event itself amen I I would like to just thank everybody who made that possible [Applause] amen praise the Lord we had enough young people there young enough young young teenagers there that I'm hoping they'll sow the seeds of of faith and the rest of them to say man we had a good time you should come next year amen I hope we don't have to do it next year amen amen I hope that we're singing around a throne in glory next year amen amen um our next um let's see the next several weekends are going to have special events attached to them hope I have all this right Saturday the 17th that's this coming Saturday Saturday the 17th we're having our Christmas dinner and our singing and that's going to take place right here on the grounds and you've had announcements about that but I'm really really looking forward to it I've already got my song requests for all you singers so y'all get ready because I'm going to be bombing y'all with all the ones I want to hear and if you have any other time for any others that's fine amen praise the Lord I was listening to a sister Debbie and I getting ready this morning we had um the podcast of Bethel Music and uh man Sister Sarah you was singing a song and we were jumping and wow I said I'm going to make Sarah sing that I'm going to ask Sister Sarah to sing that at our at our Christmas singing so my it's just wonderful wonderful wonderful and all the different ones uh then on Sunday the 18th the very next day we'll have our children's Christmas play the sister Chastity is spearheading for us so next weekend is going to be a really special weekend the following weekend is going to be extremely special because we had to come to church on Christmas Day hallelujah amen what better place to be amen for the true reason of the season now here's a little Bend in the schedule we're going to start at 10 A.M no Sunday school 10 a.m Sunday December 25 10 a.m no Sunday school amen I know that's a big family day and I'm for it I'm for family I'm for anything that promotes family so we will start early at 10 there will be no Sunday school we'll start directly with the regular service at 10 A.M look forward to seeing all of you here amen praise the Lord then the following weekend on Saturday uh December 31 we're going to have a special service with communion and foot washing and like we did last year we're going to have a special exhortation from our entire Ministry team amen I'm going to give them all about 10 minutes amen now brother Jason can't be here he's already crying over that so that means I get his 10 so I get 20. but the rest of them get stuck at 10. amen so we'll have some of the word and then we'll have the Lord's supper and foot washing and then of course the very next day is New Year's Day Sunday and what a better better way could you imagine a better way other than in glory to come to the house of the Lord then think about it friends think about the privilege while two-thirds of the country are hungover you get to wake up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and clear-headed and a Heart full of love and go to the house of God and Worship the Lord and receive eternal life in the word so wonderful wonderful um now that's uh let me say that's not a watch Night Service we're going the service will operate under normal time parameters so we'll start at seven and run our usual normal schedule on that 31st I'll be aiming at it anyway just know that we're going to let the brothers have about 10 minutes each and then we're going to have the Lord's supper and foot washing and uh and then we'll dismiss whatever time that is we won't stretch it out and we won't try to cut it short but it's not a watch Night Service per se if you want to go to one of those I would imagine that those are still done in in some places and you could probably get out of here in time to go to another service and be in church till midnight amen I've done it and I'm not saying they're not nice I I've enjoyed myself Adam before but amen that's the way that we we've been operating here I got a couple of prayer requests let me stand you back to your feet as we get ready to go into the word um brother Caleb writes in prayer requests for joy and Lana they stayed home today not feeling well also prayer request for my cousin Phillips daughter her name is Ella and she's 14 years old and the enemy is heavily attacking her mind with depression among other amongst other things just want to lift her up in prayer and believe for total and complete I love that total and complete deliverance Amen in this situation brother Mark writes in we seem to all we seem to have caught what is going around Tabitha is really sick I am somewhat better but still not well I have all the compassion in the world for that battled it myself all last through the last weekend and then all through the week with lingering lying symptoms Devil's still trying to hinder today but it's all right amen he's he ain't nobody amen he don't run nothing but his mouth he makes no decisions for me all decisions of my life are made by my heavenly father and if the devil can even if he can even get something against me he's got to go get a pass amen so why should I worry why should I fear the very same Jesus standing right here amen praise the Lord amen happy to have you all in House of God some visitors with us today God bless you amen happy to have you here all right let's turn into the into ours yes okay okay oh my okay let's and that's that your mechanic's mother -in-law very good praise the Lord um I'm going to invite you with me to First Thessalonians 5. and we're going to read verses 2 through 9. now I am going to go back today at the direction of the Holy Spirit who completely hijacked me Saturday morning very early and you all know I've testified to that before thank the Lord I should say on my Human Side I thank the Lord that he does it but I thank him that he does it only a couple of times two or three times in a whole year and so uh he wasn't I guess he wasn't going to let me get out of 2022 without zinging me one more time and so uh material that I prepared weeks and have been working on and adding daily and adding daily um the Lord came and I'm still going to come to that amen um so uh you know Sarah a conversation we had that don't you worry that's that's coming but I actually believe that today will also amen amen speak to that so you just have faith and so uh the Lord sent me back the sermon I preached I believe on October 16th called that I titled the dance begins that was October 16 of this year I'm going back to make today part two the dance Begins part two if you missed part one you can go right on our website and get it amen God bless you let's read from first Thessalonians 5 to we're just going to get two through four and let you be seated and we'll come back to the remaining verses first Thessalonians 5 verse 2. for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief let's bow our heads father we thank you Lord for the reading of your word the assembling of the people the songs the congregational worship the special singing Lord as I said and listened and even even from the Sunday school teacher and his class Lord I said in my back office just amazed Lord at how you were confirming over and over the songs that were sung the special songs that were sung the very lyrics Lord were confirming confirming confirming that I know I have your perfect will this morning but Lord it'll be difficult for me because it's a little way that I rarely if ever maybe one other time in all my Ministry have ever tried to approach it in this way and so I'm needing your help as a mortal man Lord and I pray that you will also be with my heart you know sometimes what a baby I can be Lord but I get so caught up in your word and I just get so emotional and I thank you and so I'm asking for your Divine help today help me to just stay Lord on track and give me the words that you need now Master we have some sick people brother Mark and sister Tabitha Lord under the attack of the enemy Lord this poor young girl here through the family of our brother Caleb and not only that his wife and daughter and sickness plaguing them and the enemy plaguing the mind of this young girl we rebuke Satan and Lord in the name of Jesus Christ and we call for healing mind body and soul in all of these cases and all the other lingering effects the enemy has put on us today Lord be with my lungs and my throat as I am still with quite a call floor but but I'm I'm believing for for you to take control now in Jesus name we commit it to you amen God bless you as you're seated and I covet your prayers very sincerely today I I want to go studiously along I don't want to you know labor or you know too many points brother Jason Sunday school class today saved me a mountain of um of foundational stuff and it was I kept thinking because I I knew that that burden was on me and I said but Lord this is going to be impossible how in the world I don't want to rush over anything and I mean I I'm not a two-hour preacher and that's what it would take and you're gonna have to help me figure this out and lo and behold I'll walk in the door and brother JD's supposed to be on rest he wasn't even supposed to be up here and I walked in the door and hear him and I say my goodness brother Jason's got the Sunday school today and as I said in my office I just was speechless just speechless when he came out of the door I said Jay come in here through my closed door come in here and he heard me he walked in I said what in the world my it was just so amazing to me and so last time I want to just take a few moments and I want to bring just a half a dozen or so quick points from the first time I preached on the dance begins and I'm not really going back to try to rehearse it all like I say you can go to October 16 and get part one but in part one we took a uh some text out of the Book of Genesis we read a bunch of different places but I I I started zeroing in about how that God had made you know lights and and he had a greater light and a lesser light and one was to rule the day and one was to rule the night and we found out in the 18th verse of Genesis 1 that he used the light he he he that one was to rule over the day and over the night and here was the here's the second thing and to divide the light from the darkness and that was important to divide the light from the darkness and God's soul that it was good so you know the fact that God says to you you know as a Christian what Fellowship hath light with Darkness don't be out here rubbing shoulders with the world those shouldn't be your closest acquaintance you're you're you're your closest interaction shouldn't be with your career people it should be with the family of God don't don't think listen parents Mom and Dad please hear me when I say don't think that won't be unimpacting on your children but you you this is part of training a child the Bible doesn't say raise children it says that Women Marry bear children guide the home but the Bible says train up a child and as I've said to parents for years training is not easy and because it's difficult and it takes some work and it takes some selflessness you you can never train children correctly if you if you're selfish if you're only chasing your own uh motives and plans and dreams and your children are just a sidebar and all you're doing is feeding them and clothing them and housing them and keeping them safe see but it doesn't just say raise children it says train them up so because it's it takes work the the great cop-out is Parental delinquency and and so you you parents don't want to do it to which I say you will train them whether you want to or not your lifestyle that they observe will train them so you might as well do it right see amen and so the the world today is falling under the prophecy that the children would raise up at the end time to be tormentors of their parents of society there's a headline today where the sheriff of Brevard County in Florida actually had to get the attorney general and some other official important looking people he had to put on his uniform with his badge and his gun and his taser and and have a video shoot in front of a prison and was saying we're tired of the way you children and teenagers are acting in school that we've got teachers abandoning their career because they're dealing with violence and drug use and abuse from especially Junior High and high schoolers and he was simply putting it back on the parents to say you better get a hold of them before I do because if I get a hold of them it ain't going to end well and can you imagine that the the mind of parents it was so offended at that that they are holding rallies against that and liberal-minded parents are saying I don't like his tenor and I don't like his threat and I don't like that kind of language that the the absence of any kind of discipline is the whole reason that children have risen up in the last day to be tormentors of their families in their homes in their schools in their governments so you it's an important point it's an important point to train up children not only by teaching them the word of God because I can't do it all but by demonstrating the word of God which I can only do a couple of times a week or if I happen to see them in the middle of the week so it's all I can do is assist you Mom and Dad you understand I can't raise your kids I love them but I can't raise them yeah I can only be your assistant amen how many appreciate a good assistant thank you see I already spent more time on that than I should have so it was to divide the light from the darkness so don't be offended when the Bible tells you to shun the very appearance of evil don't get offended at that when it says you ought to live different you ought to look different dress different talk different act different go to different places do different things see and so the point to be made is that you know the main functions of light are to rule and to divide you get that so the light of the Gospel is the greatest light its function is to rule and to divide see so you say why why are you just drilling that so hard because Satan's aim that being true then then it shouldn't surprise you if I say then Satan's aim is to keep you in darkness for as long as he can any way he possibly can expose you to Darkness and get you to linger there he his goal then is to keep you from walking in the light not just believing in the light but walking in the light walking continually in the light see so this is this is what is so important evil spirits as we said in part one evil spirits roam in their greatest power and influence late at night that's a fact the prophet taught us that because they the darkness conceals them and that's that's their that's when they really when they can hide that's when they really can do their biggest damage all right so so so evil evil people lurk in the night and so this is why Paul would carry on brother Caleb in our in our opening text back to first Thessalonians um five and we'll pick up uh here at verse five ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness so so let me say to you come into the light as often as you can take every opportunity think of new ways to do it be inventive of new ways to capture your time and discipline your life to coming into the light say how can I do that coming to church is a good one for opening your Bible is a good one getting on your knees is a good one fellowshipping the Saints is a good one so we find that we have not been he says therefore let us not sleep as to others but let us watch him be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken or drunken in the night let us whoever the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for a helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ so so light is associated with salvation you you'd believe that wouldn't you Darkness creates uh an opportunity for wrath Darkness creates a an appointment for Wrath sin pays wages did you know that and they're not wages you can decline sin actually pays wages and the wages it pays her death so light catch this now this is going to be important what I'm I'm about to say three things in a row they're extremely important for the for the last third maybe the last quarter of my sermon today because I'm going to tell you a story a true event that happened to me recently light is the place of Fellowship light is the place of cleansing light is the place of sinlessness you ought to thank God that he sent light into this age because now because he did that you who had no chance and no access to it you now have an opportunity catch it underscore you have an opportunity to have a place where you can have restored fellowship with God a place where you can be cleansed because you need it and you're going to watch you know what's going to happen to you tomorrow you're going to need it again and again you're going to need to stand but listen with the let me just say to you today that with the just the way the devil such a tidal wave of condemnation that he's constantly battling us with you're going to need a place where you can enter into and feel sinless Hallelujah and I'm here to tell you it exists and it's in the light and in the light when you can have Fellowship you can be cleansed and your cleansing creates the fellowship makes it possible and when you get into fellowship with God I'm here to tell you you feel sinless all right here's the fourth one light is the Gathering Place of God's children that's how you know it's God's children because of where they gather see and what what their life is made up of so in light friends in light is where Genesis is restored to you that's the place that because when we're here born in sin we're so far away from that Genesis creation where God had perfect unbroken fellowship with his family and Adam was an amateur god of the Earth that's a place where I want to be that's the millennium but I'm here to tell you something friends that kind of an atmosphere is is the door is now opened to you because of that day on Calvary the door is open to you to to come back into your Genesis condition again all right so we we're we're brother Brandon makes a couple of statements here in a message that moved me greatly yesterday I shared it with my Ministry team and brother I said my I've never heard brother Branham use this language I told my wife I said I've never heard this tapes he said that's impossible I said no I realize now I heard the one he preached this sermon twice and once at his Tabernacle I've heard that one but this is the Evangelistic one he went out and preached at Chautauqua and because I never heard him use this language and he says yes sir we pay so much attention to the Undertaker now it's kind of unavoidable amen we pay so much attention to the Undertaker I love this let's give some thoughts about the uptaker once in a while what the uptaker once in a while he said the one that'll take us up some of these days the only translation the only one who can bring us from the grave I love this the only one who can present us before the father without a fault without a spot without a wrinkle brother Branham says hallelujah I say hallelujah you ought to say hallelujah this uptaker can present me right now you mean right now before God without a fault without a spot does God really know me yeah he knows you better than you know you he can present you without fault without spot without a wrinkle see he starts telling the story of an old black man about 90 years old good friend of his brother Brandon grew up knowing him says he'd come walking down the street one day and he said now now here here I'm going to really start turning toward where brother Jason's Sunday school helped me so much today laid so much material I don't have to go into so he says uh he's he says he's about 90 years old he'd come walking down the street one day and he yells over to brother Brandon he says I want to tell you something and I said all right what is it rep and he said well I'll tell you he said you take an old rooster you can tie his feet nail him into a box now how many have ever felt like that that's what the devil was doing to you man I want to worship God I want to have joy in my life I feel like my feet are tied down somebody's got me nailed into a box I can't move I need to be a Christian Lord where are you how many how many of us have been right there and he says he says you take it on rooster Ty's feet nail him in a box any way you want to said but when it starts to get daylight he'll turn over and Crow and brothers said I said that's right he said what makes him do that Billy and I said he's a rooster and it's breaking day Hallelujah that's right it's his nature and when a man is born of the spirit of God and has this eternal life anyone the Holy Ghost comes you've got to scream out something's got to happen and I didn't say I've had those times where my feet felt tied I felt like I was nailed in a box and couldn't move but one day the sun rises and I felt something inside me even still tied and I said hallelujah praise the Lord I'm still tired but praise God I don't need to be free of my trial to praise him I can Praise Him in the storm Hallelujah amen it's his nature so he says you yourselves know perfectly the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then cometh sudden destruction but you brethren are not in darkness not that day should overtake you as a thief there's way too many quotes to reap them all and I elected not to put a PowerPoint up so I've just got some highlighted places I want to refer to them and quote a few lines and you can go get the message uh June 6 1960. June 6. it's not the one he preached at his Tabernacle it's out when he went out now watch brother Branham comes to this and he's starting to make an argument and build a case for knowing the Lord Jesus personally now you see why brother JD's Sunday school was so vital to know him in a personal way he says the reason that we should go to Jesus to find this that no one else has but him and of course what does he have eternal life and he's the only one he's the only person and he's a person God is a person he's the only person that has and can give eternal life so I think it's almost an understatement to say you need to know him personally I don't think that can be oversold I don't think that can be over hyped I don't think I could wear that one out you need a personal relationship with Jesus Christ if you want to have eternal life he says where you see we're going out of this world he says we're sure of that see only those who are alive and remain are changed when the when the dead in Christ rise first and only the ones left alive are changed in a moment other than that every man no matter how good he ever was has an appointment with death see and so brother Branham says we're going out of this world we're sure of that and we don't want to go listen up teenagers listen up old people we don't want to go in the wrong direction the question is not will I go that's settled you will go the question becomes the problem is the rub is I gotta go but I don't want to go on the wrong direction there's and brother Brennan says there's we want to go to heaven when we leave this world every person wants to do that there's only one Heaven there's only one way to get to heaven and Jesus said I am that way that's the reason why that we must go to Jesus because he is the way now brother Branham is going to emphasize that over and over and over and over and over see he so now there are two ways that people try to say now watch this he's gonna just kind of testify to the people from his years of experience going around the world he finds that there are ways that people try to say if I live the Golden Rule uh or if I keep the Ten Commandments or some of his Catholic friends on certain days if I stop eating Meats sometimes people make those things a religion you know or he says or some religious Acts which is all right said if they want to believe that but still that isn't the way to heaven now he's going to say it again Jesus is the way all right I do not say that that you want to do those things won't go to heaven but you have to find Jesus first because he is the way thee and he repeats it the the only way now there's a way the Bible tells us and the prophet alludes to it there is a way that seemeth right to a man now that means that he becomes convinced that he's okay when he's not that's the whole point of that Old Testament passage it's people who are absolutely unwaveringly convinced they have faith that they're right when they're wrong and they think they have eternal life and they don't know they're going to hell now that's a Bible reality and so we need to solve that today amen so he says he goes on he says now Jesus is the way all right now there's a way that seemeth right to the man and he starts to tell a story a true story about how he says the pastor and I speaking of brother Neville he said we just spent some time with his sister-in-law trying our best to convince her that her religious Society couldn't save her but the woman was so so brainwashed that and she was inside this doesn't say what it was it wasn't a denomination or church or anything it was some kind of a society that was a religious society and he says you know we we were trying to get her to understand that that there's no life in that that that thinking that her Lodge was what was going to take her to Heaven because she belonged to a certain society and a lodge and they buried her thinking that she died unconvinced of needing to know Christ personally so he smothered about him as a preacher this is a pretty astonishing statement this got everybody's attention got my attention when he started saying it he says we're not here to condemn men for sinning I said we're not here to condemn sinners can you imagine a preacher saying that I'm in the Pulpit today but I didn't come here to condemn Sinners for sinning see we are here to condemn sin not the sinner man does not listen at this listen listen listen this is so profound man does not lose watch this uh man does not lose his life because he is a sinner he loses his life because he refuses to accept his life now it's obvious that it's not the life he got born with because he goes on to to Define what his life is and his life is in Christ Jesus the only one that has eternal life so the life you need is not the one you came here with good you with me the life you need is not the one you came here with that one's that one's doomed that one's born under a death sentence you can't clean it up enough it won't matter like brother Joe was preaching it's still all your works are still filthy rags see and so so we find that you you're not a sinner isn't destroyed because he was a sinner because brother Branham said God will never condemn a man for being a sinner never never no way because a man was born a sinner and God knows that he says one will condemn the man as he remained a sinner when he didn't have to that Jesus Christ by his by his death burial and Resurrection Ascension and descending back in the Holy Ghost made a way that you don't have to die so if you die and go to hell you've did it to yourself you're suffering a retroactive sentence you were born with and you never got rid of though you had an opportunity to see so he said this woman would not give up the idea that her Lodge was just as good as any church or anything else woman with cancer Pastor buried her day before yesterday say people would do that on their deathbed to do it all the time I've spent my life at the bad side of dying people knowing they're dying and go right on trusting in some human construct some religious system of Fallen man and you can't tell them otherwise I can testify to them other real realities of the Living God and the power of the resurrection and I got stories from from from 30 plus years of ministry on on six different continents I know he's real I know this word is true I know God keeps his promises and you tell them that and they just cannot divorce themselves from thinking and they're they're so entrenched in this human construct and they actually go to meet God in that condition he says now there is a way that people think they they just live a good life and can get to heaven but that's an error listen that's a prophet that's an error you do not get to heaven living a good life I'm not saying there's that's not blessed a good life is a better life to live sure regardless if I wasn't even if there wasn't a heaven I'd still live like I live because it's healthier I get to keep all my money I don't blow it I don't give it to the tobacco or the alcohol I don't wake up hungover I don't suffer any of the of the diseases and sickness that that kind of Lifestyle brings I have a nice home I I'm not divorced I raised up children they're honest men I I mean the way of the word is the way man it's a much better way than the way uh uh uh that's against the word of God you're crazy for living outside the dictates of a Christian lifestyle see and so but but the prophet is saying and and there's there's blessing in that but but as far as Eternal value now that's a different now you've gone to another level because now we're not just interested in just blessing here I want to know this life is so good and I love it so much I want to know how I cannot get it to end I would like to every man would like to live eternally and I have found a way to do that good news news flash I'm I'm a I'm a life insurance salesman life Assurance let me talk a policy with you friends Hallelujah so he says people think they can live a good life and go to heaven with that scenario God you do not get to have my living a good life The People Under The Mosaic law live The Good Life but Jesus preached to many of them in in hell then there here's another one he says then there's the way of the church the way we try to go to Heaven by the way of the church but in the church as good as it is it's still not the way the church can only point you to the way now he's going to say it again you ready but Jesus is the way and he'll keep repeating that more and more than any other thing in this sermon Jesus is the way some has perverted that way to change it into learning your catechism saying your Creeds or going by some Book of Rules amen he says and and and that may be ever so good but that's not the way the only way to go to heaven is through Jesus Christ he starts telling out of his experience he said I'm astonished today when I I walk up on people and I ask them are you a Christian and they say oh well I'm a Methodist and he said well that's that's not my question I ask you are you a Christian see and he said they say well I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian or even I'm a Pentecostal or a pilgrim Holiness or some church now there may be all right but that isn't the question remember now we got an exact kind of question that's not the question you never get the right answer having the wrong question see so so so the question you know so so so he says they may be all right but that's not the question the question is are you a Christian and you cannot be a Christian until you have received Christ in you now the world is filled with denominations of all kinds 30 we got north of 33 000 when I looked about three or four years ago I'd say what it is now 30 above 33 000 various denominational and independent Christian ideas of what it of what it takes to make Heaven your home I feel sorry for the sinner I want to tell you something friends at the center wouldn't have a chance and God couldn't condemn him on the last day if he didn't have me and you living out the word because everybody's got an opinion of this one book but when you've got a life that's living it and reproducing that life that you can read about here and the same signs and one and the same power is operating in you that you see operating in here then you can know you've found the way see each one of those movements certainly were useful to God down through history in their original form absolutely Baptist Pentecostal Methodist Presbyterian they were all useful to God down Through the Ages but they became but those names became Blasphemous names once the light moved on according to the Bible see the Bible said that this great with her Harlot daughters hadn't was found in the Book of Revelation with names of blasphemy see not words of blasphemy names of blasphemy see so those names become Blasphemous names once the light moves on to the next age and to stay in them then becomes a death trap because it becomes a false light you understand he says now not many people uh say that I will go to heaven he says now many people say I will go to heaven because my faith tells me so I belong to a church and my faith tells me I'm all right now I believe watch this I believe in the grace of God too but look now listen close because we're going to have to qualify this but look no matter what your faith is you're not going to be judged by your faith you're going to be judged by your works when you die that sounds counter-intuitive because it's through faith by grace through by faith through Grace that we are saved not of your Works lest any should boast and you remember Paul and James almost seem to disagree with each other and Paula said it has nothing to do with your works it's all faith and Grace and James says well show me your faith with without your works and I'll show you my faith by my works in other words there was already people in the early church claiming to be Christians who didn't have any works they were already just Christians in name only this is hundred centuries before nicaea this is during the time when the apostles are alive and preaching so don't be amazed if you have people sitting in message churches who have who believed the doctrine but have never been born again and do not have a life to back it up no signs and wonders and power and overcoming strength not even proper separation between light and darkness that's not new the early church had that see so now a bit of clarification is needed here all right clarification of course only made possible by the progressive revelation brought To Us by the same Prophet who just made this statement so I'm certainly not going to go outside of everything he said it becomes clear to us especially after the opening of the seals it becomes clear To Us by his teaching that that this scene he's speaking of is the great white Throne judgment you find it in Matthew 7 in Matthew 7 you find them coming to the Lord and saying you know I did not we do all of these wonderful Works in thy name and we cast out devils and did Mighty miracles in thy name and he'll say depart from me I never knew you now that's that's a part of the narrative of Revelation Chapter 20 The Great White Throne judgment another part of the narrative comes some chapters later when you get to chapter 25 and Jesus starts giving a little more of a picture where you've got two sets of of categories of humanity one he's going to separate and put on his right and one he's going to separate and put on his left and and you're going to find that that when all of this comes forward that there that that you have at this judgment bar you have people who come before the king and they they have a human faith in their works they said it in Matthew 7. did not we do all of these works in thy name they went to the Grave believing they were okay and that and chapter 25 shows they're not okay and they're going to be he said depart from me you workers of iniquity these are people who had a human face so brother Branham says you're not going to be judged on your faith you're going to be judged on your work he's talking about human faith see about your human belief all right but it was clearly human faith not a revealed Faith from God founded on God's word and when you read Matthew 25 it actually gives the appearance that life and death are determined based on Good Deeds or the lack thereof but it's not that because you can't earn eternal life based on human works we know that you know I mean I mean you know even even sincere good works with good motives and good objectives because you can't you can't force God to pay you eternal life because of your Works God will owe no man you understand you you can't hand him you don't get to stand there at the Judgment bar and hand him your time card of Good Deeds that you labored to do in the earth that this this is Judgment of their hearts and it's a judgment of their hearts response to the word see this is why the iniquitous crowd who had tons of Works don't get in because it was all iniquity their heart wasn't in the right place they had a human confidence that failed them and they're stunned they're astonished they're saying they even call him but Lord Lord I I remember doing all these things and he'll say I never knew you at all see in some cases and listen friends in some cases you know it might even you find that that summer getting into eternal life it because in some cases it was merely their heart's response to the word that they saw living in you what a privilege we have that somebody might gain eternal life because they they couldn't see the word you see it couldn't become quite clear to them but they they recognized it whatever you got that's what I want to be like that's what God told Cain if you'll just do as your brother see so we're not outside the scriptures so we find more than this that this of course is Humanity outside election that's for the bride she's not judged at all because Christ was judged four she accepted his pardon by accepting the word for her hour because that was Christ the bleeding word that was Christ The Living Word that's why it's bleeding it's got life in it it's Christ that's what has come in our day that's what that's what the early church had that's what they had in Jerusalem they had the living bleeding word they had Christ and it was lost down Through the Ages but God said I'll send a prophet and he'll turn that back he'll turn your hearts back to the original faith of the fathers so the elect lady is Seated on the throne having escaped this judgment completely so let me here's where I don't have to keep lingering on there because Brother Jay did such a good job this morning brother Branham goes on to say death does not change your spirit it only changes your Dwelling Place it only changes houses for you if you die in your sins you go to a worse habitation than what you're living in now but if you die in Christ you shall be with Christ and he says it again for he is the way people say I have faith that I'm saved and I don't doubt that they're completely convinced that they are they joined a church they got their name on a book I don't know they might have all kinds of religious activities and if they've if they've say well what if they've passed from Death unto life then they'll come to the light because Jesus said the Holy Ghost would bring you to the light it won't leave you in partial light a false Mirage a painted fire it'll bring you into the new day see people say I have faith that I'm saved but but that is only based on sometimes we have to be careful now because sometimes our confidence is based on our is based on our Doctrine and what if your doctrine's wrong see say well but we have the message of the hour well what if your understanding is wrong all right your understanding of the doctrine could be wrong uh you know I I and I would say to you today that you're hanging your soul which is the most valuable asset you have on Mighty Shaky Ground just to sit in a even a message church and say I believe God sent a prophet and I believe the message of the art and I believe all the teachings of the doctrine that's pretty Shaky Ground friends if you haven't moved on to know him after the power of his resurrection if you haven't entered into the fellowship of his sufferings if you're not being made conformable unto his death so that you might be a partaker of his life see see I know the message is correct teaching of the Bible but that's still not the proper question you might say but I believe it brother Jason Pastor Jason I believe it that's wonderful now now you can go in the right direction to get the proper question so I still don't have the proper question no the proper question is not am I in the right church or am I believing the right teaching but has the faith I claim to have changed my life that's the proper question not am I in the right Church or am I believing the right teaching but has the faith I claim to have changed my life has it taken all the desire of Sin from my heart and even imma tell you something say how do you know it's happened to you because even if I Stumble I find myself running as fast as I can back to God back to my knees asking for Mercy asking for forgiveness asking for renewal I don't want the world I can't stand ungodliness my flesh stumbles in it my mind thinks the wrong thing but I run quickly back Hallelujah asking for Mercy unabashedly asking forgiveness even if I ask for forgiveness of the same thing nine times last week I'll last nine times more this week continually again and again and again it's changed my life it's changed my desires this is a beautiful thing it has so many benefits and the kingdom don't don't don't go to it Caleb I'm moving too quickly but just make a note of it in Hebrews 4 16 the Bible teaches that those who are truly born again of the spirit of God that they should they should feel perfectly free to verse 16 come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace and to help in time of need how many have a need how many need help today oh this is a time of need that's the time of not only great need but great help Hallelujah there has never been listen friends there's never been a greater time or age in all the history of humanity that needs the grace of God like this age like this time from the time that men lived in caves and painted murals on the wall to stepping on the surface of the Moon and uh stepping from a space module onto the dust of the Moon and and now planning to step on Mars from the time of living in case painting murals and he's trying to step on Mars and there has he has never faced an age quite like this one is for the first time from the first time that the first heel of the first human foot walked on the earth there has never been a more perilous time than now in this age and in this time a man I want to taste something a man or a woman you need to know that you have access to someone who has the answers to life you need to have it in a reality form this is not an age to just be convinced of right teaching you need to know that you have access that you can walk in boldly to the great God and say master I have a need and I'll say what isn't my child here's my need you have it believe don't doubt it go you'll receive what you've said you've got to know where to find direction you've got to know that you can ask for and be granted an audience with the King up job 23 for me Caleb and we'll start at verse one but just before you put it up let me just make these comments job knew that when he got in trouble and job had some trouble and what was curious is job hadn't done anything to deserve it and God was using him for the grandest purpose that to date nearly any man it had to be in the top three maybe higher because God has a desire to put the knowledge of a redeemer in the earth so that man's is not shifting trying to find his own way around God's got to put knowledge in the earth that hey there's a redeemer you're not yeah and he calls job to suffer so that job could get down so low and he could just feel like he's no higher than the grass or the treaties or the nature itself he just wants to die he curses the day he was born he doesn't he has I hate it that the moon shined on a man-child and he's so distressed and I've done nothing wrong and what is all this about and and he gets down to say I see the grass and it dies but it gets to live I must be lower than the grass I see the flowers and the trees and they die but they come again but what about me what about a man if I die and I'm dying do I get to live again and that's when brother Branham said lightning trapped in Thunder Road and said God grabbed a Thunderhead stepped out on it and came whirling down get on your feet job I need to talk to you I'm bringing in a revelation into the Earth and he showed him a vision of that day on Resurrection morning when Christ comes out of the grave and he says I know my redeemer liveth and in that day I'll see him in these eyes and this flesh will Behold Him and brother Brandon said if job could have only known everything he went through and all the stuff he suffered and all the heartache was just so God could put that Revelation in the earth that if a man dies shall we live again yes he shall live again there's a redeemer there's an all-powerful King and that's all you might need this morning look at job 23. what you need is an audience with the King almost called the sermon then you need an audience with the King you might not need a new church you might not you might get a new church you might get a new friend you might get a new job you might get a whole new career but that won't do it I want to say to you today get to the king get to the king don't worry about a new friend or a new career or a new job get to the king make sure no matter what is in your life you got school ahead of you you young men and young women you got school ahead of you let me tell you you're going to need the king you're going to need to have an access you're going to need a portal you're going to need to be able to walk through a portal and walk into the presence of somebody greater than you this is Job's eighth declaration it's a response to eliphaz then job spoke again my complaint today is I'm sorry uh let's read it from there even even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier uh than my heavier than my groaning all that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no see job's Faith No but he would put strength in me this is somebody in spite of every trial knew the God he served he'll put strength in me he says there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered from ever forever from my judge behold I go forward he is not there now here's his problem here's the problem he knew what to do he knew where he needed to get to but how do I find him see this is on the blood of bulls and goats he's got no access that Fellowship in Genesis is lost you get me behold I go forward he's not there backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where do where he does work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept listen friends when you in the midst of whatever trial the devil can put you through in the midst of this perilous time in the midst of this crazy world whatever you might face you need to be able to say this my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined verse 12 finally neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food I'm going to read that quickly through the NLT listen now then job spake again my complaint today is still a bitter one this is his eighth declaration my complaint today is still a bitter one as is before his Revelation and I try hard not to groan aloud if only I knew where to find God I would go to his court I would lay out my case as a courtroom it's a judgment seat remember remember when Jesus was on trial and the Bible says pilate entered the judgment seat again so this is this is a place where an authoritative figure enters into for judgment see all right so you get that so he says if only I knew where to find God I would go to his court I would lay out my case and present my arguments then I would listen to his reply and understand what he says to me would he use his great power to argue with me no he would give me a fair hearing honest people can reason with him so I would be forever acquitted by my judge I go east but he's not there I go west but I cannot find him I I do not see him in the North or he's hidden I look to the South but he's concealed but he knows where I am going and when he tests me I will come out as pure as gold for I have stayed on God's paths I have followed his ways and not turned aside I have not departed from his commands but have treasured his words more than daily food still with me David knew there was a clef in the rock David knew there was a secret Dwelling Place of his Pavilion brother random saw it as a little room and he says I will meet you in there little wooden room would represents Humanity I'll meet you I'll meet you in there that's not a metaphor that's for real and brother Adam says why why in there it's always been on the pulpit it's been open to the world it's been an attraction I'll meet you in there well why because this will be a secret the world won't know about this place this is a place where only my bride will have access to I want her to know that she can come to see me I want her to know that that day on Calvary and the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes this possible that she can walk boldly into this Pavilion let me tell you something friends where in 2022 stop waiting on some kind of Supernatural thing down the road oh he's gonna he's gonna have a tent we're going to have a room and we're going to do something nobody even knows what we're going to do I'm here to tell you I'm living there now now I went and visited it even recently I know it's there there is a refuge for the family of God a covert from Storm as the Bible says don't presume upon God now listen listen don't presume upon God here here's a real theme of what we're bringing to you today you can't presume don't presume that you're okay with your human faith it has to be a revealed Supernatural Faith because that's the grace that's the grace don't turn Grace into disgrace that's what the world Christianity world does today they turn Grace into disgrace oh I love the grace of God I can live any way I want that's not Grace Grace is a revealed Faith Hallelujah that's the grace of God you know it's Grace when it teaches you to deny ungodliness because that's what Grace does that has to be your whole heart seeking a relationship I've heard people quite Cavalier when it comes to this quite Cavalier when it comes to repenting to God for their sin brother Branham says in the sermon he cares do you care it's short I'm going to read it in its entirety he's talking about repentance without any sincerity at all just sloppy insulting to God he says what if I say now I'm going to confess it that I done wrong and brother Brandon's saying now I really did do wrong and he said I'm going to go confess it that I done wrong and I say good Lord oh friend of mine you know that I know you're real well praise God hallelujah think you're a good old fella forgive me you old friend old friend I didn't mean it that way see now you say that's sacrilegious brother Brown says it is to make a confession like that but what if I go to the Lord and say I didn't mean to do it just that way you help me and I won't do it again you know what he said he'll do when you repent the way he just named he said he'll refuse your sacrifice you're trying to go to him and say I didn't mean to do it that's what you need to be saying but instead it comes out hey a buddy old Powell Chum hey Jesus how about it come on man wink wink you know he goes into a an example of if he was unfaithful to his wife and say hey old girl how about it you know mother of my children how about what do you say forgive me I didn't mean how about it says how about you how about you forgive me he said my wife would look at me like what has happened to my husband I heard it I've heard it said to my face to my face as a minister I I had one young man say to me I started talking to him about his soul and about his lifestyle he'd been raised in the message and taught better and he says oh he's wiped me off and just gave me the hand I I'll just quickly say Jesus forgive me my sin and I'll be okay don't presume you'll be okay you won't be okay Paul reminded that his own Christian Countryman in Rome in the ninth chapter he says he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion there has to be something more than a hope so more than a mental workup friends it's got to be more than Sensations or emotions some enthusiasm listen listen can I just say this I I employ emotion and enthusiasm I do that deftly I do that craftily I do that I practice that you know you know why I have to do that you know why I have to employ emotion and enthusiasm a lot of times unfortunately that ain't going to save you but what it will do is it'll break open your crusty mind that you spent so much time for the nonsense of the world and your mind comes in here so poisoned and I have to use all kinds of human uh Ingenuity you know to to break through your crusty mind open the door of your heart with its rusty hinges because you don't never open it to the Lord very often I use it for teenagers because the social fabric of the world tells them it ain't cool to worship God and then others because I I know they rarely if ever see it in their family life at home there's nothing wrong with emotion as a tool I'll use it whatever works as long as I can find it in the word of God and there's plenty of emotion and sensation and enthusiasm and Zeal in the word of God David danced with all his might and then in the name went out the next day just to spite his wife and did it on purpose even more but I want to tell you something friends if you're going to find yourself entering boldly into the presence of the king it'll take more than emotion it'll take a revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally a knowing from the depths of your soul that you've passed from Death to life and may I add and I add this by experience a knowledge that I was in him before the foundation of the world that's what that Revelation has given to my heart that's how I can walk even even in the face of personal failure I can go to my knees and walk boldly and it ain't Jesus hey old buddy old pal it's Master it's Lord God my father I'm your son and I I I remind me and I remind him I'm your son and I need cleansing I know you've heard me say it and you're going to hear me say it again I need you now more than ever before oh my it's gonna when I need to talk to him when I have troubles in my life when my when my burdens are heavy and I need an audience with the king oh Hallelujah when I need to talk it over with him and plead my case when I need to plead your case and my case together oh I enter his court I enter his court with a revealed faith but I have passed from Death to life I enter his court with a certain knowledge that I have been Justified all the way back to my Virgin condition just as if I had never been born in sin just as if I had never committed a transgression in all 59 years of my life that's why I can enter boldly into his Gates you find examples of God intervening I know I'm I'm at the outer limits of my normal but I'm not done can I want to get to my testimony can I get to the I need 10 more minutes of preaching I want to give you a testimony are you good you find it all through the Bible and I'm going to try to skip some of this if I can you find where life is like we read in the Bible you've got to read the book of Nehemiah and he wept for Jerusalem he wept to have a temporary wept for Jehovah he wept at Sea worship restored and we find him that when they go to build and try they're trying to do a good thing you got all of these naysayers oh it was in his ears every day you ever have that friends you ever like Nehemiah you're trying to build a wall you're trying to restore worship and you got the devil over here yak yak yak yak you this you that you this you that and the only thing he ever seems to do is discourage you devil don't have one encouraging word for you I don't know why you listen to him it's all about sins that you committed that Jesus don't even know anything about anymore see they're not in the sea of uh they're not in the sea of his deep remembrance theologians actually believe the Sea of God's forgetfulness is a is a sea that things are your sins are buried so deep he just chooses not to remember them anymore I'm so thankful for a prophet who said no sir that sin gets annihilated it gets turned back and goes back on the head of the devil who made you do it and you stand justified in the presence of God as though you never sinned in the first place you're not forgiven you're Justified you find stories in in ezron and nehem and Esther and you know the the beautiful thing is one night in the Book of Esther God had a God had a family member who had done a lot of good stuff and a lot of good stuff for the king save the King's life actually Esther's uncle and uh the king is up one night he can't sleep God drove sleep from him calls for the chronicler hey come come bring me the record and bring me the record bring me the Chronicles uh how far back I don't know last year just read me the Chronicles I want to make sure I'm up on everything and they're reading well this one did this and listened to them what do we do for him well we gave him a royal Medallion and this one did this and what'd you do what do we do for him well we gave him improvements to his house and gave him some social security and and and he gets to Mordecai and says who says Mordecai that's a weird name yeah he's a Jew he's a he's a he's a captive brought over by your predecessors oh really what did he do well he saved your life really yeah they were going to kill you assassination he found out about it and tipped off your captain of your garden and you saved your life it's what did we ever do for him he said oh nothing so oh my goodness and he literally calls in his enemy who hates him and says what should we do for the man who's done the greatest deed to the king and that imagine when this guy thinks it's all him well you should have a parade and you should put a medallion around him you should put him in your cherry and blow a trumpet and and he says that's an excellent idea go get Mordecai the Jew and do exactly like you've just said so God has a book of remembrance Kings have a book of remembrance you understand you go you go to Ezra and Ezra gets a gets a decree from from the king from Cyrus go back and rebuild the Temple and they go back to do it and then I hear you here you come all those naysayers again all the people who are trying to forget it don't do it you're terrible we hate you and and and they and then another king comes to the throne and Cyrus is gone and and another king comes and so these people take advantage of the politics at the time and they write a letter to the new king say listen these people are are murderous and rebellious and they they their their insurrectionist and you better not let them re-establish themselves here and the King reads that like oh my goodness he writes a Royal Decree send this by the fastest writer quickly this is a cease and desist stop all building stop everything right now and Azeroth says okay well we happen to have an old record from a previous King that said we could go do this and in fact it gave us money out of the royal Treasury and said that anybody who gets in our way he'd put him on a pole he would impale them on a pole and kill all their family and burn their houses down if they even got in our way and in fact is he told he gave us a letter that when we got to the back into into Palestine that the governor right there has to give us more money out of the out of that treasury to help us and so they just took up their letter handed it back to the messenger said go show this to the king and they take it back and they come into the next king and he reads he looks at this letter and he goes goodness send to the send to the to the Chronicles send to the library quickly oh my goodness this is treason I might have to kill myself go quickly the laws of the mees and Persians can't be broken not even by a king and they hurry they quickly run and they I love these Old Testament stories look at all these young kids just like look at me look what happened you see I use emotion on purpose Hallelujah like running under digging digging digging Cyrus okay right here it is oh no they run back they headed to the king and he reads the words of Cyrus now he's committed treason against the performer King he immediately rips up his old decree writes the new and puts a stamp on and says go quickly back whatever you do don't stop don't go left don't pass go don't collect 200 go go all the way back to Palestine and tell them now do not harm these Jews if you get in their way I'll kill you your dog your family your cows I'll burn your house down I'll poison your fields stay away from them and give them all the money in your pocket God has a place God's courts are real God keeps his word you know the problem that we have is we live in this Fallen body and Fallen man has tried for years to figure out a way to bring him under heel outside of a new birth and the new birth is just easy just get a nature change and then you'll you'll you'll naturally want to do this you won't have to try to do you just naturally want to do it your whole desires will change you might still stumble and fail but the beauty of it is it won't count won't count see and and and they they they have all these gurus and I was I've seen a documentary the other day and there's some Guru in Australian there's a guru in Tibet and there's there's one out west and a Native American and they got tents out there and they'll sweat you out and give you peyote so you have visions and and they'll they'll make you live in the jungle for three months and walk around half naked and don't get in the shower and and they're trying to purge the old man out of you well sometimes they have fantastic success because mental disciplines emotional disciplines work but here's the problem here's the rub that man you took to Australia or to to bed or to to the West he'll just come home with you he'll just come home with you and it'll only be a matter of time before he re-emerges because you just can't keep that up eventually after a while and even and here's the real thing even if you go to your grave firmly disciplined in your lifestyle you'll still die and Miss heaven see I offer you today a complete death of that haunting man I offer you today young people a complete death to that haunting man the spirit of the true God will annihilate him and take up his Abode in your heart forever say might I fail yeah you might you might still fail but it won't count and you won't ever have to go back to Tibet again you can get on your knees and open a direct portal to the throne room of God and let me tell you something just like Nehemiah just like Ezra none of your detractors can keep you from it brother Branham says every son and daughter of God have a right to have a conference with God and they linger out there you find that in Zechariah 3 you find that in Ezra you find that in Nehemiah you find all of these naysayers trying to keep the blessing off in in Zachariah in the uh the the days of Ezra you find that he stands up Joshua the high priest I've preached on it here and trying to condemn the whole nation of Israel based on the based on their sins and if he can get a guilty he's in God's courtroom he walked boldly in see Satan used to be able to do that he used to be able to come with you into the presence of God Calvary changed that Thank God now he can't get to you because if he's going to get to you he's got to come through the blood and then he'd be your brother he wouldn't even be the devil so so the beauty of it is but but in Zechariah 3 he tried to argue and if he could have won that case God would have lost the throne Satan would have took over Israel would have been finished and you'd be done but thank God he triumphed and and he dismissed the devil's charge not on the basis of works because Israel was guilty but he dismissed his charge on the basis of election this is Jerusalem whom I have chosen this is my people you will not bring an accusation again against them which are in Christ Jesus this along with the king's book of remembrance friends this was the book of The Law of God David loved that book David talked about loving it this is along with that book of his law he has a book of remembrance just like in Ezra just like in Esther he'll bring you go into his presence let me give you some encouragement today if you got a need and you got a trial you got a question you got something you go to the king because I'm here to tell you the devil might stand outside and try to get you to stop from going on your knees he might try to haunt your life with every kind of thing just to keep you from using your portal but you got a right to use it you got a right to stop drop and roll and use it anywhere you need to on the spot you could be at Walmart and use it Hallelujah you could be in the woods camping and you could be in the house of God and use your portal Hallelujah and he's real and you can go into his presence and the devil can't come there hallelujah it's the secret of his Pavilion oh my he's got his book of his law he's got a book of remembrance say I'm suffering so bad you know Paul wrote to the Corinthians and told him to encourage him he said listen I know you're suffering but if you'll just if you'll just stick with it it'll turn to comfort how do you know that Paul because it happened to me I was suffering but I stuck with it and now I have great comfort and he wrote to the church you'll have this Comfort if you just don't faint just don't think just keep pressing see you can't lose if you just don't faint oh my friends I I've said a lot today about this God but I'm here to tell you I know this God I speak of and I know how his court Works say how do you know about Jason from years of studying the book of his law dedicated my life to studying his law book I've spent many years in service to him and I know from personal experience in fact I just as I said to you I just came back from from his courtroom Saturday morning itis returned from a case myself and and let me give you some good news before I tell you this story I was able to completely and I don't know that I've ever so completely triumphed over the enemy so completely in my life I'm 59 and I don't know it's equal I've I I've went into deep prayer many times and I've had the spirit of God come upon me many times and spiritual gifts have worked through my life and I've seen it hit with perfect accuracy but I've never quite had a prayer at least a prayer experience like the one I had the wee hours of Saturday morning the beauty of it is it wasn't for me only it's for you too I always take you all with me when I go see the king I don't know if you know that but I always take you all with me when I go see the king you know now let me just say I'm not referring to like brother Brandon's experience beyond the curtain of time that was a special thing that happened to Paul a special thing that happened to Elijah I'm not saying I'm not saying that wasn't that clearly absolutely wasn't that brother I'm so that was even more than a vision and even mine wasn't a vision but you know but listen brother Branham also describes that brother Branham also describes a traveling in deep prayer and that's on tape as well that you actually go somewhere that that that I found myself ascending into a place and when I did the whole scene around me changed now I can't be responsible for what you believe I can scarcely believe it myself I'm just here to tell you my wife is a witness I couldn't stop crying I was trying to make these very notes I'm using right now just trying to get notes to tell you this experience while it was fresh in my mind I found myself ascending into a place and the whole scene around me changed and I wasn't just merely kneeling on my knees in my living room at my 5 a.m chair anymore I was I was aware I was still there don't don't make this more than it was I was perfectly aware of where I was but somehow I went somewhere in my mind and the scene was so vivid and so real and I went somewhere that's the only way I can describe it I was able to bring and here's the beauty here here's a beauty I was able to bring and I caught a revelation I've always wondered did he just mean that for William Branham all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given you now I'm not claiming equality to that but I I found myself saying Lord all that I ever loved and all that ever loved me is here with me and I looked around and it was you all and it was my church and I realized maybe that's where it applies to a local Minister I don't know I'm still trying to figure this out but I had all of y'all and y'all we had literally we had come in out of the darkness and we were stepped into a court it was brilliant brought all of you into God's presence Saturday morning while you were sleeping while you were sleeping I took you with me on a journey and while the whole group stood in the glow of his judgment Hall that he had he had entered into his judgment Hall I asked for an audience and he entered into his judgment hall now what's amazing is I had asked for this on Friday morning when I was praying Friday morning I said Lord and I had some private things and personal burdens and things going on in my mind and I said Lord oh I I just need that special something and here I was I thought my it's not even a day later and he's I was stunned that was happening so fast I said my goodness you're already doing it friends listen I'm I'm on my knees I'm fully aware that I'm in my living room in the dark on my knees but all I can tell you is there was something of me somewhere else and of course I was first you know I I I I I I I had the whole group stood in this glow of his judgment Hall and naturally I was I had to First secure my own place before him a feat not not not not without resistance from the enemy who stands outside who stood outside to oppose me you know and uh he I mean this is this this is why you see he he can't enter there now that I mean that's why John in Revelation 5 doesn't seem when the book is claimed you notice that there's one on the throne there's a strong Angel there's a there's a lamb comes there's the Four and Twenty Elders there's the sea of glass there's there's Heavenly Angels but there's no Lucifer because why the lamb is coming to claim the book Hallelujah and Satan can no longer accuse you he's dismiss summarily from God's Courtney he God will not hear an accusation against his family once I had secured my own position plead through a through a fresh cleansing of my own heart and my own mind at that point I'm here to tell you at that point I was kneeling there and I was so aware wow the enemy is already defeated I knew that since he has had cleansed me and my heart condemned me not than I Knew by the study of his book of law I Knew by his book that I could have confidence toward God because my heart condemned me not at that point I had no condemnation not for anything no matter how heinous in all my life I literally stood in the presence of the king secure at this point I had nothing wavering I knew I was standing there with no condemnation even possible to me because I was in Christ in Romans 7 tells us that I knew that this being in Christ I knew that this being in Christ was a place that you could come into boldly not as a beggar not as a beggar but as a as a member of the royal family as a prince as the son of the Kingdom that's what the word has done for you in your life friends I knew at this point there was no weapon formed against me that could prosper and quickly realizing the full height and depth of what God had done at that moment I hurried quickly and brought four cases forward to stand in front of him those four cases were the most critical at the moment those highest on my list of the present distresses you should know that this was not the place of grandeur not the one that we will gather around someday as seen in Revelation it wasn't like that no it was more like a place where you could meet him alone and have your case heard with immediacy Eddie used to tell me a dream as a little boy I grew up as a man making him retell it over and over and over again before he passed away he wrote all of his dreams I have a record of them and brother Eddie said one day he he had a dream that he walked out it was night it was dark just dark darkness everywhere and he said he walked out on a raised like a raised Jetty like a peninsula narrow only four or five feet wide but it was five or six inches above the waves and he walked out on it and he says all of those black churning waves he knew was judgment and he knew God was showing him something in a dream and all this judgment that was trying to get him and trying to overwhelm him but he said I realized as I looked around it can't touch me I'm above it and he says something struck me a feeling come over me brother Eddie described he said a feeling come over me I thought my goodness I could forgive sin I said that's quite a feeling he goes yeah that's how I felt he said the love was so pure the feeling in my heart was so real he said I thought I could forgive sin he stood and I realized now I thought about brother Eddie's dreams I was standing there a place this this place this remember this is just it's just a small place of light it the best way I can describe it to you is a place in the middle of the battlefield a small sanctuary of light right in the big middle of Darkness everywhere that we call everyday life we're surrounded by Darkness but you're a light in the midst of Darkness that's where we are friends where royalty standing in the presence of the king and I had the ability against all of Satan's yapping and yapping and yapping I had the ability to walk into his court say how did you get there I walked into my living room and went down on my knees and began to lift up my voice and I my portal started turning and the next thing you know I'm I'm ascending up somewhere Hallelujah placed right in the middle of the battlefield a place you can only get to in prayer a place where all are the voices and oppositions cannot enter a place where you and the King are alone in his Pavilion it's hard to describe how I felt standing there but I can tell you that I knew it was some special place and I knew it was some special moment it was a place of perfect love it was a place of perfect faith it was a place of perfect acceptance I don't know how to describe it any better I felt at this moment perfect everything I was so aware that everything I had ever done was struck off and I was standing in the presence of the king oh my there was nothing to hinder me nothing could touch me like my dad's dream it was like a clean dry place where the Waters of judgment couldn't reach and and and I was I and I I made up my mind at that moment now you'd think you couldn't do this but I had the presence of mine at that moment when I realized how special this is because it's happening in real time and I'm I'm saying oh this is so special this is oh and I quickly I thought about four four critical needs that have been on my heart for a while right here in this audience and I thought and there's more than four but these were four that are the most distressing at the moment for the present danger and I in my mind I quickly quickly I thought I'm not going to miss out and I grabbed these four people four of you it was five it was it was five of you because it was four in three individuals and a husband and a wife and I quickly brought you forward and I became this Lord this need and I've talked to you about it and I've prayed and we've talked it over and I've asked you they need your help Lord and and and the king is just listening to me and and I was talking about these four critical needs and and I even gestured friends it was so real I caught myself with my arm going out I got myself Lord in all these and I went wow who am I waving it and I said Lord all of these two and it was all of y'all standing just inside the globe I had brought everyone out of the darkness and while I was talking to him and and and and and and I gestured all of us standing there in the the various needs that we have and in a little bit just in a little bit it didn't last all that long I'd say the whole thing was over in five minutes and then a little bit I was back in my living room I was still on my knees and I had such a warm feeling in my heart I just raised both my hands up to God and I just started thanking you and I just started praising him and I just started worshiping him and listen friends praising him for his good goodness and I want to say to you today I don't know how these things will go the four specific needs I brought to him I brought him I brought him before and all of y'all that I gestured to all of those who love me and whom I have loved who God has given me to be a shepherd that I I stood there and I and I was aware and I thought to myself and I thought I'm going to write this down so I don't forget it I don't know how these things will go but I know they got a fresh Hearing in its presence I can promise you that I I and I know him say Well how does that help me because I know him to be a god of great Mercy I know him to be a god of great love I know him to have great care for his family how many feel like his family today I want to tell you that you should you should have renewed hope I want to say to you today whatever is your need don't you fear God knows take renewed hope today that he'll do it for you he I can tell you this I felt this and I wrote it down he will do more for you than I could even think to ask while I was standing there so don't let your soul be troubled don't let it be disquieted anymore I say to you with David hope thou in God for you shall yet Praise Him and for the help of his countenance and this is my final word to you if you never see my face again and you never hear my voice again here's my final word to you let not your heart be troubled anymore the King has heard your need let not your heart be troubled anymore the king has hurt your need now he already knew it but now there's a court record that can't be dismissed you say I know because I took it there Hallelujah friends he's real he's that real stand up with me this morning I'm preached oh my goodness I ended up preaching two hours I haven't done that in years and years oh but he's real the love of God is just that real I'm telling you something friends I went somewhere and I come back to tell you he cares he cares and brother Bradham said does he care don't listen to brother Brandon when he's preaching that sermon he cares do you care and brother Branham just God does he care and he goes through the Bible and pulls out case after case and he says does he care oh my goodness how much he cares see but you got to care first and if you care about his word he'll care about your soul he'll care about your need if you care enough to be sincere when you pray and pray often and give your whole heart and Life to God let me tell you something friends I hope I stood thinking about that all day Saturday and I thought about it again this morning and I said to the Lord Saturday I said Lord could I have that every time I pray is that even possible did I turn a certain combination on the portal did I put in a certain code did was there something I said and you know I found where brother Branham said talks about those High Realms that a prophet goes way up far far far above anywhere I went to I actually just went into a sanctuary right in the middle of the battlefield prophets went up and saw things in heaven and glory and saw way off in Prophecy nothing compared to that but brother Branham even comes back from that he says now when I get there he says I come back down he says oh I wish I could live there all the time see but that's what makes it special so you you can I want I want you to remember after today while you're tucked asleep in your beds in your pillowy softness you just remember you're somewhere else also because the shepherd who loves you and I take you with me every time I go and you know what I'm going to do tomorrow I want to take you with me again I know I'm gonna do the next day I'm gonna take you with me again and I I'd love to come get you and not find you and get there and you're already there does that make sense oh I say I'm not sure any of this makes sense brother Jason well joined the party but all I know is is telling you the best I could describe in my heart God loves us and he's aware of every need you have bow your heads with me all over the building [Music] well Lord there it is I did my best I told the truth I was very careful be careful with what I said I don't I don't want to make it more than it was but I'm sure not going to make it less and just because there were certain elements I couldn't fully explain I I know what happened and Lord I I just say as Gulliver said these things are all true and happen to me and I thank you for it Lord and I I was left with that that marvelous sense that I had stood in your approval and all those you have given me and love me and those who I love they were there with me and you were rejecting of none of them you allowed all of them entry with me and they stood in the glow of your light Just Around Me Lord like a semicircle and I looked back and I looked into their faces and I pointed to this one and gestured to that one I said Lord this one too and this also and what about this and this over here and I felt that same acceptance from the King so I want this church to take courage today Lord I know this is a perilous day I know it's more perilous than any other time in history but I know you're not unaware and I want to say today to the people that the King has had a fresh hearing of all your needs and he's concerned and he cares and I want to tell you today that I'm privileged above none of you that every one of you having come back from it I can tell you from experience all heads bowed now I can tell you from experience every one of you who have passed from Death to life and who have known Jesus and the power of his resurrection you have the same access I have you can walk boldly into his throne and stand there redeemed clean pure in perfect love in perfect Faith no condemnation nothing to hinder you all other voices silent I thank you for that Lord that would be the final piece that I want to give to these people that they have the same access don't take a a church joining friends don't take a religious rules don't take any of that that'll never do it you've got to know the Lord Jesus Christ you got to know him personally in the
