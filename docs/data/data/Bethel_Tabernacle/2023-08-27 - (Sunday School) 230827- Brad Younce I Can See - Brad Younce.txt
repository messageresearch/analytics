we place it into your hands in Jesus name amen hopefully they got this screen working just go read one scripture for now but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear so we got out of blessings you can have your seats for a little title I kept going back and forth because toward the end of this if I get to it it talks about overcoming but I ended up just sitting on the title this morning says I can see so blessed are your eyes that you can see you know we're sitting here this morning a privileged people if we see this truth we're a blessed people we should be the happiest people in the face of this Earth of what we what God has allowed us to see because there are some people they don't even have that option there's some people that sits in the church they said I water in the world are they talking about you know we know program said never every uh congregation there's three kinds of believers there's not very many here this morning so which one are you [Laughter] so if you're an unbeliever hopefully your eyes can be open and you can see but blessed are our eyes your people just coming to church they have no clue they'll just sit and listen to the preacher and like what's he even saying some come to church says man I wish to preach a hurry and get over so we get brother Tony back out here boy that guy can sing we like the way it makes us feel but we're but we're rejoicing those that can see I mean when a brother stands up here and says God says I am one God not three we could say amen amen When God says I came down born of a virgin walked on this Earth as humans we could say Amen where God says it wasn't an apple in the Garden of Eden that caused the fall or we could say Amen because our eyes are open blessed are your eyes for they see he said I sent my Prophet to forerun me we could say Amen he opened the Seven Seals all we can do is say Amen everything everything God says we say Amen because bless our our eyes for we see our ears because we can hear it just comes down to one thing if your eyes are open you're predestinated for it your call to this we are ordained to hear there's nothing we can do with it we didn't have a choice we'd have a choice we were called to this thing we are Overcomers we're Overcomers because God said so nothing we could say you heard preachers say we your kid didn't have a choice whether we born or not Jackson didn't have a choice ah no I ain't coming he's coming Hallelujah that's why we should come to church every time the doors are open right now we're waiting on the priest to come out to open up the Scrolls and open up and he'll say turn your Bibles to revelation okay he's going to reveal to us an open Word and we can understand and we can say Amen we could say Amen to over every word all this so we can have overcoming power that's why it's so important important do we try to make it to every service if we miss one service we miss so much remember the story it's happened it happened to Thomas you know after Jesus died you know John 2019 and it says then the same day talk about the resurrection at Eden being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and said unto them peace be still can you imagine you're all sitting there y'all crying and sad and your your Leader's dead gone all of a sudden your doors are locked barred nobody can come in then Jesus appears right in your midst yeah yeah he's a ghost scared him to death that's we didn't see Jesus come through those doors this morning he's here he come in and had him a seat yeah we couldn't have a service without him and when he has said so he showed unto them his hands and hands and his side and then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord then Jesus said to them peace be unto you as my father has sent me so send I you and he breathed on them and said unto you receive ye the Holy Ghost but Thomas one of the twelve was not there Thomas missed service for it for a reason you know ten disciples were there except for Thomas he didn't come to church that service guess what he'd missed he missed the visitation of the Lord he missed Jesus walking into the church through the walls that's what happens when we miss church sometimes we might miss a visitation Hallelujah you know we might even miss that refilling of the spirit you know our brothers we get together here every Thursday night and that's one of our main goals our prayer for refilling of the Holy Ghost to drop Among Us we might miss that service and it have actually happened whew wow you know every time you miss a service there's always somebody to say that was the best service ever I see these texts and I for the ministers chat and I'll be out somewhere wow wow what a service what a man that's awesome I'm sitting here going of course it is of course it was you know they asked Thomas Thomas they've seen Thomas the next day there's like dude where were you what look what you missed Jesus came he breathed on us we received the Holy Ghost Thomas like ah there's no way I'll have to stick my finger in his hand in his hands fill the prince put my hand in his side then I'll know who then I'll know for sure well the next week that's coming back to church Thomas says I'm going that's why we ought to be can't wait to get up alarm clock goes off at six o'clock you're like church day I know most y'all didn't get up at six this morning at 6 50. close enough and after eight days again the disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut again stood in the Mist peace be unto you you know Jesus didn't go or Peter said hey Peter how you been this week John he didn't talk to anything he walked straight to Thomas come here Thomas stick your finger right there in my into my hand let me have your hand and put it in my side what did Thomas say my Lord and my God Jesus just saith unto him Thomas because thou has seen me thou Hast believed blessed this definition for blessed is supremely blessed we're blessed from on high Supreme supremely blessed you're well off happy so we ought to be happy this morning blessed are they that have not seen and yet believe I can save today this scripture has been fulfilled blessed are you that have not seen but you believe we haven't seen Jesus but we believe him we didn't see Jesus walk on the water but we believe it happened we didn't see Jesus take two two loaves of bread and five fishes and feed over 5 000 people but we believe it happened we didn't see Jesus walk up to the tomb of Lazarus say Lazarus come forth and a man have been dead four days come come to life we didn't see it but how many believed it happened we didn't see the stripes put on his back but we believe it happened phew Hallelujah I gotta calm down gotta leave it for the preacher you know I I wrote this down I put it in big bold letters I believed it happened just like if I was there and seen it myself that's how real this is that's how real this message is I wasn't there when it happened but I believe it happened in second Corinthians 5 7 for we walk by faith not by sight what happened to brother Brandon when he was he landed in Memphis and going to the plane keep walking what I got a plane sitting right there keep walking okay so he just walked by faith it don't matter what look what it looked like around him he walked in a rough neighborhood brother Ron Spencer told one time we went to visit that uh that pyramid That Bass Pro Shop down in Memphis and brother Ron says you know this is the very ground where brother Branham come walking down through here walked right across this ground to go into the apartments and sitting still behind the pyramid this day oh my how awesome is that they built a pyramid on this ground but he kept walking no matter what that neighborhood looked like what happened when he walked by faith somebody's son got healed we walk by faith we live by it the just shall live by faith it's not by what we see our eyes can deceive us how dark it is out here all the stuff we see all the chaos all the all the bad things that we're looking at we can't base it on that we base it on on faith not by sight Hebrews 11 1 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen Hallelujah for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were made not made of things which do appear another version of this I like faith is the confidence that what we hope for and I Look to that word hope there it means expect faith is the concept of that what we expect will actually happen Hallelujah it gives us the Assurance about things we cannot see you know faith is like starting your car how many thought about it when you got in your garage just more and turn the key how many what do you think did you think about what happened when you turn that key what happens behind the steering wheel they got this little wire that runs out of the out of the starter that or the when you turn your key down switch into the behind the steering wheel out to your car to your starter from there to wherever it goes I don't know you can't see what's going on behind that steering wheel but things are happening when you turn the key things are moving it's like faith you don't think about it you just get your car and you put it in reverse back out of your garage put it drive and take off you're not thinking about what what it's doing oh you got one goal in mind you're headed to church that's that kind of faith we have in God we don't even think about it When you pray it just happens things are moving and we can't see you might pray for something forever and ever we pray for stuff for years we're like Lord have mercy why don't you answering and so I said well Abraham waited 25 years for his although it ain't got 25 years but things are working when you're praying things start happening you believe it's going to happen I have a confidence that the Raptors are going to take place and I'm going how many has that confidence the Rapture is taking place and I'm going through their faith the people in the days of old earned a good reputation Abraham had faith like I said he waited 25 years on it him sitting there like an old man on a cane I'm going to have a child what there's no way you can't even stand up things were working Abraham didn't see it Sarah didn't see it but things were changing okay I'll move by faith we understand that the entire universe was formed at God's command that what we now see did not come from anything that can be seen First Peter 1 8. whom have not seen ye love we haven't seen Jesus but we love him we have a city but we sure do love him whom have I not seen ye love in whom though ye now see even whom though though now ye see him not yet believing well we don't see him but we believe him yet Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls verse 12 unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister to things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which thinks Angels declare Angels desire to look upon Faith cometh by hearing because Jesus says behold I stay at the door and knock are you going to open if you hear the knock open the door let him in you know when Jesus spoke he spoke in parables you know solar went forth to sew some fell on good ground some fell on Stony ground some fell on people like what is he even saying Jesus did that for a reason because disciple says why speakeas thou impair down to the in Parables he answered because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom but to them it's not given everybody could read this Bible but there are things only the bride can see only the predestinated special people we're a special people can see what God is saying because blessed are your eyes for they see the Jesus said whosoever hath to him shall be given he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath so therefore speak out to them in Parables because they see and see and not and hear and they hear not so neither do they understand but Jesus again says blessed are your eyes or is that blessed word again supremely blessed because blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see they've read these same scriptures for years but couldn't understand what's he saying what's he mean he's going to have a church in the last days what is what is it Church ages you go ahead in the world you start talking to them they'll say what's a church hey what do you mean Church ages I think there's seven churches that was in The Book of Revelations they just don't know they just look at you like what is he even saying well like somebody probably doing me this morning what's he even saying where's he getting at I wonder that sometimes myself wow how much time I got who let's hurry through this one their special privilege that we receive because we're able to see and hear because Revelation 2 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life the tree of life was still in the paradise says Jesus Christ we all know that it never left we all enjoy the benefits of it we're eating from that tree right now oh the word to him that overcometh overcometh means to Prevail to get the victory to carry off in Victory to win the case to him to overcometh you won the case I'll give you the Tree of Life because Jesus says behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and ye shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the father is with me these things have I spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world ye are of God little children I have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world that was the Ephesian Church age you eat from the Tree of Life in the Smyrna Church he that hath that ear notice how he starts this every Church age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and to he that overcometh shall not hurt of the second death God will she we shall Escape hell did you notice that brother said this he said to every Church age they got their their reward but the next Church age got not only got thirds but got the one previous so so smyrnia they're going to escape hell and they get to eat from the Tree of Life pergamus he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit said to the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden manna we can keep going a special revelation and will give him a white stone White I love this I'll skip some of it in the ancient courts of Justice the accused were condemned by black Pebbles but the acquitted by white ones as though you never done it here's your white stone Hallelujah thyterra he that overcometh and keepeth my works and to him to the end I will give Power Over All Nations he that overcome at the next age the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not block his name out of the book of life and I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down in Philadelphia Church age even the overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God he shall go no more out and I will write up on him the name of my God and the name of my city of my God which is New Jerusalem cometh down out of heaven for my God and I will write up on him my new name Overcomers he that hath and ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and this is the reward for your day to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even has I also overcame and has sat down with my father in his throne we get all the rewards we eat from the Tree of Life we've escaped the second death we're wearing a white robe we got his name wrote all over us and we're sitting in his throne with him he that hath an ear let him hear blessed are your eyes because you can see amen God bless you
