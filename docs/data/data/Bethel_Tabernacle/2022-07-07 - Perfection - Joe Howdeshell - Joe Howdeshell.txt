it's good to come out and see each other ain't it rubbed shoulders with the world all day and i tell you it's just nice to be able to come and see some sisters that stress right yeah see some brothers that act right hey man it's good to be around god's people and ain't no big eyes and little yous we're just all the family of god and and uh i tell you i rather like brother jason said he texted me the other day and it's always happened to me and i don't understand it but he said well it would take a minister to understand it and i was just going down the road and i said well i'm going to preach somewhere pretty soon i just don't know where and a few minutes later he texted me well i say that afternoon about a couple hours later he texted me and i said well praise the lord the lord he just starts you just start feeling that anointing and i can't explain it but if you're a minister you know what i'm talking about but you know i wanted to uh talk tonight a little bit and i've heard a lot of different ministers and um it's it's been a real pleasure being here in the past few weeks that we've been here thank you brother i'm already dry um it's been a real pleasure coming here and and being a part of this little assembly i didn't bring my fellowship card though well yeah we're not supposed to need one of those are we not supposed to anyway but sometimes you feel like that the spirit's kind of starting to creep in a little bit you know the uh amongst uh some of the churches and and uh if you don't believe this doctrine and you don't believe there's a little certain thing to kind of draw a little circle and just draw you right out and i tell you what brother i'm a good circle drawer i i've just always just drew them right back in if i if i can some of them just don't want to be drawn in though ah well that's for no more we don't we don't want you over there so but i love them anyway amen but uh so i'm just glad to be here tonight glad main thing is we want to see what the lord is going to tell us now i want to read a vision that brother branham had and i of all the things i thought i remembered i forgot my glasses but i think i'll be good i've got it um i've got it pulled up here so i want to start off with telling about a vision that brother branham had and he had you know many times he would talk about having a vision and if everything wasn't exactly in the place it wouldn't it wouldn't happen it would have come to pass in this particular time he was talking about the vision they had a little boy that was um his arms were all twisted up his legs were all twisted up and and so when he saw him he had double pneumonia and he's his father backslid and he came and talked to him and so brother branham had already told the story of how he went there and how he just you know the lord had already showed that the little boy was going to be healed he said just go there and and it'll be and so he goes and immediately grabs a little baby up he's about three or four years old and picks him up and and and says in the name of jesus christ be well when nothing happened he got worse see and he said you see i got ahead of the vision and so we don't want to get ahead of god's vision do we so he's talking to brother vale he said brother vale if this if this uh pad was supposed to be laying here i can't say a word till that pad is laid there see has to be just that way it showed me so i said bring me the baby and the daddy brought the baby to me and i prayed for it and it got worse so i thought now something it really lost its breath and they had to fight and shake and everything get breath in it i thought now there's something wrong and i happen to think where's the old woman that wasn't there yet so they take the baby laid it down they was putting stuff under his nose everything and crying the mother screaming hysterically and everything but the baby was just barely breathing boy i wouldn't have wanted to be right there at that time because i mean they had most confidence in brother branham and then he goes and he prays for the baby and he gets worse and the mama's crying upset and he's like oh my goodness the baby got worse just barely breathing i thought well through my stupidity i have misused the vision of god because i never waited on it being so over excited we ever wonder if we've ever done that before by this you can see brother veil why i wait i don't care who tells me i love you as my brother brother don't never try tell me something to do when i feel that i've got the will of the lord see no matter how well it looks the other way see how well it looks see i see never try i've got the will of the lord no matter how well it looks the other way i'll wait for him see and so i learned a lesson right there many many years ago and to do exactly what he says and don't do it till he says it's ready to be done i said mr emma i said mr emil you still have confidence in me as a servant of christ now this is after everything got into place he had to wait for the woman to come there the hat was laid in a certain way said you have confidence in me as a servant of christ he said i sure do brother branham i said can i tell you now i spoke ahead of the vision a while ago that's why it didn't happen if you still got confidence in me go bring your baby oh my i see i see it was right then you see go bring me your baby he said i'll do anything you tell me to do brother bill i wouldn't be afraid to pick it up because they pick it up it just went the breath all together left it brought the little baby up to me reached and got it in his arms brought it up to me and stood there i put my hand on it lord forgive the stupidity of your servant see i spoke ahead of your vision but now let it be known that your god of heavens and earth no more said that the little baby throw both arms around his daddy began screaming and crying saying daddy i feel all right now now see there's something to be said about that and i've i've i've read that many many many times and i know that brother branham said that like everything had to be just perfect in a perfect order before that would take place now the thing about what we're what we're looking at today is that never before have we had such a detailed explanation of visions than in this day we've we've read about them in the bible and we you know ezekiel had them and and and different ones jeremiah had them different ones but we never had anybody that actually said and try to explain to us what the detail about a vision daniel had a vision that was troubled many days at his head but it didn't really say what they were but we had a prophet to come and tell us that that what the vision was if we can understand this tonight is that god was allowing the prophet to see through his own eyes he was seeing the very mind of god and that's where we're at tonight if we can ever catch the vision of the very mind of god and so how privileged are we tonight amen when i start to think about that why couldn't it just have happened why couldn't the baby just gotten well because god already said it was going to be well but he was looking through god's eyes and it had not happened yet he couldn't get ahead of that no matter what we try to do in our life it's got to be in god's time we can't get a hold of we can't get ahead of the vision amen i'm so glad that we can hear his voice tonight aren't you when the world is hung up on a man see we hear the voice and we see what god brought to us through a prophet in our day we we know what the what the visions are we know when he said never one time did ever fell well they couldn't fail because they wanted brother brown's visions to start with they're god's visions that he was allowed to see the very mind of god now the rest of the world can't see it they don't believe it because they're hung up on the man amen they're hung up on on a little kentucky prophet or a little kentucky hillbilly that didn't have any education and so they're hung up on him and so we can also bring that down to the extreme in the message some people get hung up on him too the other way that's all they can see and miss what god's doing now in his church they say oh what he did back 50 years ago what he did back 60 years ago and i thank god for that where were you i was asking brother jason in the back where would we be tonight without this message i don't know where i would be i really don't i might be out in the world on a beach somewhere with a beer in my hand i might be a apostolic it might be a pentecost i don't know where i would be but i'm so glad that god sent this message hey man and i'm not hung up on the man i love him i respect him we should all give him respect and due diligence amen due respect to him but all the glory goes to god see everybody wants to put it back on well we don't need the preachers anymore see the fifo ministries failed all we need is just put the tapes on that's all we need well there's a lot of truth to that just like any doctrine and it's no more than a doctrine every doctrine that's ever come out there's a little bit of truth to it see and we've all many of us have come up in this message we've been acquainted with so many different doctrines and i can start naming them off and and i'd probably run out of time tonight because there's so many different doctrines a brother might read in the seal book and get a little revelation or get a little opinion is what i honestly think it is mostly opinion and then they'll run off and start a little uh little sect over here and and say well now if you this is it right here this is i got a picture of the toe you know i got to pick the you joined the the the toe group over here i got a picture of the knee now now and now we got more revelation but this is all you got to come over here this is it and i grew up in a church that that um oh that was on the other extreme of the spectrum don't listen to tapes at all see uh just get rid of them get the revelation from me because god's put put me in this place to to break the word to you so you don't need the tape see and and you're wrong on both ends see we got to stay right down the middle keep that balance amen now we have a balance no there's no way we'd ever know these mysteries without brother branham amen never know the mysteries how in the world we were just talking about that great educated men they they said and they go through the greek and they go through the latin and they go through all these things and the best that they can produce is a million miles away from what god has for this bride to get us ready for rapture all of the denominations combined and jehoshaphat before he went up uh to ahab wanted to go and push out the syrians and he said um they're eating our children's food and and joshua well i brother i'll join you i'll go with you but i want i want a word from the lord and they brought out 400 men oh yeah go go it's fine go before you have the gods give you that land you go and then another one said he made a horns of iron said this is what you'll push the enemy out with and and jehoshaphat said well don't you have just one more just one more see he waited on the word from the lord the rest of them just was impulsive see it wasn't according to the vision had to be according to the vision now the message is jesus christ today but we have to stay in god's program see david got out of god's program he wanted to bring the ark back to jerusalem he got all stirred up and got all excited about it brother brown said he danced and he and had all kind of religion but he failed to to consult the men of god right now he consulted all the other people he consulted the other kings and the and the governors in the military they said oh it'll be great go get it but see when he brought the ark back he put it on a man-made system he put it on a new cart brother random said that he put it on a new denomination is what he did the word of god and god wasn't even in it he was supposed to put it on the shoulders of the levites the word is to be handled by men of god not by a man-made system see that's where david got off cost a man his life why because he didn't consult the word of god he didn't consult the lord amen now we can hear some things that says well you know this sounds okay and and uh just to do this over here uh it sounds okay but what does god's word say about it i don't want to take any man's word if it doesn't line up with god's word i don't care what he calls himself prophet potentate whatever he might be yeah amen it's got to line up with god's word amen now let's turn to genesis 2 18. this is all right this morning shouting too loud emma i don't need a microphone brother luther i've been told that before not by brother loser genesis 2 18. now when god made everything and he rested and he made everything every day he said that it was good he made he made all the ocean anybody the seas made the mountains and everything he said is that that was good but now let's see if i can find 218 here there we go this pulpit ain't low enough and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make and help me for him so that was the only thing that god looked and saw that wasn't good that adam was alone and i heard brother aaron preach that when he was here and it really stuck home with me and i began really looking at what he was talking about and it goes right back to the vision of the mind of god of what he saw when he created adam because adam was living in a perfect state of of harmony with nature he was a in his theophany form when he walked on the earth but it was no man until the soul so god said he he uh made him in the flesh and he formed him up out of the soul out of the dust of the earth and then out of that came eve but see adam might have thought that he was in a perfect state and just looking at adam he was a beautiful man no doubt he was handsome the most perfect man that ever was up to that time and god had just created him there was no sin there was no pollution there was nothing he was a perfect man according to what we would say but god looked at him and said it's not good that he's alone and and so now adam probably would have thought to himself well i'm doing just fine until he saw eve but the reason why he wasn't perfect it's because the word perfect actually comes from the latina and i looked it up perfection see he was almost perfect but the original definition of perfection comes from latin it means to complete or professier uh i believe that's how you pronounce it perfecieri it means to be completed so adam wasn't completed right without his bride amen now he might have looked beautiful and he might have had everything going for him but it wasn't completed now just like an artist can paint a picture like the the hoffman head of christ and so he he paints the the poor people in the background the the beggar and he's and he's there and then maybe he paints he paints christ and then he paints the rich young ruler and you look at it it's beautiful you're looking at the picture and say well that's perfect christ is perfect the the the thatched roof and the stone he's got it just perfect in the way that the masons would have cut the stone and everything and even the way he's holding his hands he's you can tell he was a carpenter and and uh and the rich young ruler how he's got the robe on and everything is perfect but then the artist would step back and say no it's not perfect yet there's still something left and then maybe he goes up and he he paints the blue ribbon along the the hat of the rich young ruler and and you know they were they were um and the blue along the ribbon uh the blue ribbon which was the numbers 15 which they were uh god commanded them to to do and so he put the blue ribbon on there and so now now it's perfect see see perfection is in the eyes of the artist of the man who completed the picture so so he finishes painting it then he steps back and says now it's completed amen oh my so perfection means completion it means perfection it means completion amen now turn to hebrews 11. and i'm not a long-winded preacher but i got a quote that brother ram said that uh he said don't wear the people out he said he said peter preached a 15-minute sermon on the day of pentecost and won 3 000 souls of christ i should have got amen out all of y'all on that one i got a wow ain't that what he said brother jason what are you saying amen hebrews 11. now let's turn this look at verse 40. well i'll tell you what let's let's go down to verse 37 4 uh first because i like to set the stage of what he's talking about here he says they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise see god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect i think they were pretty much perfect i feel like they were the world was not even i believe right here brother paul said of whom the world was not worthy that what he said of whom the world was not worthy verse 38 they wandered in deserts in the mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect now we know what he's talking about here they were they were perfected in christ but they weren't completed without us because god had a vision in his mind and the vision was a completed church started from the foundation at ephesus going all the way up and so when we look back and we say well they well they weren't perfect without us well neither are we without them you see because where will we be without them laying the foundation and coming on up so you you can't you can't say well we don't need these stones over here absolutely we need those stones over there you can't say that we don't need speaking in tongues anymore when god put it in the church you can't say that we don't need prophecies anymore you say you can't say we don't need the fivefold ministry anymore yes we had a perfect word yes we had a perfect message that came with a prophet a man sent from god but it doesn't take away from what god has already put into the church see because god in his mind had another vision out ahead and so we're just fulfilling that part of the vision that it wasn't that they were not perfect it's that things weren't completed yet until god brought us into the picture see adam was perfect but he wasn't completed until eve was brought into the picture amen see and so oh my can i say this that god knew exactly how adam felt because he dwelled alone brother brown said with his thoughts he was uh he was the uh god the logos the elohim the i am that i am he he dwelt but he had in his mind the attributes and he had a vision of every one of us sitting here tonight he had a vision of his bride and every every believer that ever lived and trusted in him he had in his mind and every one of those has to be manifested it has to take place one time i was talking to a man and he was talking about abraham and he said he didn't believe that god knew all things he said i said what do you mean he said god doesn't know the end from the beginning i said what do you mean he said when he commanded abraham to slay isaac and when he lifted up his knife to kill him he stopped them and said now i know that you'll obey me and do all that i've commanded you see and he does say that the bible does say that but you see that's coming from an unbeliever to start with because what god was saying and i hope i can convey this to you that god's whole plan wants to manifest you and i what's the manifest sons and daughters of god that's going to believe him and to worship him he made the angels first he made adam to walk in perfectness and pureness and eve too then sin got in the mix of it amen so then the attribute of being a savior had to come the attribute of being a redeemer had to be manifested so all these things were being manifested and even well uh when but before god said it wasn't good for adam to be alone he brought he was bringing animals to him and and god and the bible says to see what adam would name them well why would god have to see he already knew he already knew exactly what he's going to do but for the first time he was now having fellowship with his creation the creator was experiencing the fellowship of the creation and for the first time when he saw abraham obeyed him in all things he said now i know now i have experienced this absolute obedience from a true son of god amen now i know now i see god knew him but now he knows experientially he's experienced it now praise be unto god amen amen that was in god's mind in his vision that he had but you and i are still somewhere in that vision tonight oh yes amen you see because john saw a spotless bride john looked into the very mind of god amen and he saw a spotless bride going to have somebody that's going to overcome in this day oh raise your hand if you're an overcomer tonight god's going to have somebody see you overcome by the war by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony who's an overcomer tonight i am an overcomer you're an overcomer it's not by my power but it's by the lord it's by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony see i talked to a little fella the other day he came to church up at brother david's just uh he didn't know anything about the lord he said i'm trying he said i'm coming and he said he said i want the lord to live in me he said and he said you know what he said he's going to to be living in me more i said right there you go i said that testimony right there i said keep that testimony never lose that you stay in fellowship with these brothers and sisters you keep around this fellowship stay here and then keep that testimony that he's going to be living in me more and more and more and more no matter how many times i fall let me tell you something i've failed so many times i've faltered but you know what what's the difference in a in a quitter and me the difference is i get back up amen we all get knocked down but when you're up you're up and the devil can look at you and he don't know what to do with you i hit him with everything i had an old uh screw loose or whatever them demons are there they're coming up just uh all bruised up and while i was in a battle i thought i had him down and like an mma they got him on the ground he'd say oh boy this is it but all of a sudden he comes back up fighting swinging somehow or another god give me that kind of resilience like uncle buddy robinson said he said give me a backbone like a saw log give me galvanized bridges how many knows that pole brother around talked about give me a wagon load of gumption up to the gable end of my soul let me fight the devil till i don't have a tooth left and then gum him till i die that's why i said that's the testimony that i want put it on my tombstone he fought the devil till he didn't have a tooth left and then he gummed him till i until he died if i have a if i have a tombstone amen brother i believe i'm looking at people that never see one i'm looking at a glorious bride that god's getting ready for a rapture tonight just might as well be you hey man why not why not be you i'm tired of taking the devil's uh who hit john or whatever it is he's trying to feed us it keeps me beat down enough i don't need to give him no help oh my but here's the thing about it you know what what you know what the problem is many believers don't realize what we are you don't realize the potential that you've got the devil knows what you got the devil knows your potential see he knows exactly what he's got he he bit into a million votes at calvary he thought he had him see he thought that this man who called himself the son of god i'm getting ahead of myself he thought he had him there when he lifted him up off the ground he was lifted up and hung on a tree cursed as every man that hangs on a tree he thought he had him there but he didn't realize what he'd done see i want to go back to possession and i'll get back to the thought it's going to have here in just a second but the possession like the brothers say a lot of times footsteps mean possession and it's true if you go back in the book of ruth when when boaz who was i i just believed he was a he was a uh have you ever heard of a poker face somebody's got a poker face you don't know what they're thinking boaz must have had one of those because let me tell you something he wanted ruth from the first time he saw her hey man he wanted everybody he played it cool i i i hear some of these young guys they say oh dad hey dad you gotta well i'll just give it away but never mind i hear some of these other young guys and they'll say uh dad he said you can't you can't act like you you know you gotta you gotta be cool about so okay all right i i got you so so boaz saw ruth and he wanted her but yet he knew there was another kinsmen see so he had to play his cards right hey man god forgive me for using that kind of a a an analogy but just to get you to understand what i'm saying so he had to play his cards right so what'd he do he got the kinsmen at the gate of the city and the gate was was their legal binding uh courtrooms that's where all the elders would come and and and the bible says that boaz had the elders to sit down and he had the near kinsmen there and and he must have really he was like um so he played it right so he says uh hey um let's just call his name joe all right he was a kinsman hey joe this is boaz so what about that piece of property over there um you know um uh it's it's like a pretty good place it's got some good uh good potential uh for wheat and barley and and uh you know joe's center he's like yeah he said you know what i think i'm gonna buy that piece of property boy it's like you know what he said that's that's good ground it's kind of like somebody comes and they tell you you want i got good news and bad news which one you want first so he's he tells but he tells joe um the good news first what is good good ground is water's close by it's got a good well on it and uh and so he's like yeah i'll buy it i buy it but then a boy is like um just one little thing there um one little catch uh you gotta take two widows and he's like huh um one little catcher's two widows what what did you say two widows come along with it he's like huh huh two widows huh i guess he had never seen ruth yet so he's like two widows oh brother and the and and what uh you gotta rate you know according to the law you gotta marry one of the widows what and you gotta raise up seed a son and guess what according to the law of uh heredity he's gonna fall there to the land and but you know but you can have it for you know 20 30 years at the most he's like wait a minute this ain't sound like too good of a deal to me i don't want this all right because ruth what is kind of a woman see and so he backs out of he takes the shoe off hands at the boat i said oh no and that was a symbol of possession in the hebrew culture and they knew that and so when he hands him that shoe he gives it to him and of course we know the rest of the story don't we and for what boaz did you know his name was inscribed on the temple on one of the pillars of the temple is that right on the first temple that solomon built amen and and what what's so striking is how that god brought in ruth who was a moabitess and you know boaz's mother was rahab so he didn't have no problem marrying him about us you know but the other guy's like oh she's not my kind of a woman i don't i don't need that but you know what that's just about how the devil is because he really don't want you he wants to destroy you but you ain't his kind of a woman let me tell you something tonight you don't ring his bell you know why because you don't listen to his vomit that he spews out you're the bride of the lord jesus christ if you don't hear nothing else in this message hear that tonight you are his bride tonight amen but ruth wasn't his kind of a woman well let me tell you something about the footsteps being possession see when moses met the burning bush god said this ain't yours this is mine and mine alone you take off your shoes moses when joshua went across to jordan take off his shoes joshua is that right who are you i'm the captain of the lord's host take off your shoes see that wasn't theirs only what see you got authority if you're under authority well god was trying to establish see we only have authority tonight because we're under authority if we step out from under that authority we have no authority is that right but let me tell you something i think about another one and and sometimes people get this all scrupled up and i was just talking to brother jason the other day about this in revelations 10 when the angel comes down what does he do he sets one foot on the land and he says one foot on the sea the sea representing people why he's he stepped off the mercy seat he's now he's got the book see and he sets one foot on land in one seat and cries with a loud voice what he's coming down to possess he's claiming it this is all his see it's gotta be burnt over but all of it's his now all this a lot of folks say well that already happened and they get way off on the on the mercy's overkick some of them say it ain't happened yet i believe it's happening now as we're sitting here see as grace is going up judgments are coming down amen and that was the part that always kind of uh got me off because brother brown said at this time when this is see this is the difference when it's completed when he takes full possession but he said the shout the voice and the trump of god he does all three as he's descending see so what what we want to do is right now the reaper he sees putting in the sickle for the harvest see but even that morning when the reaper gets up and he drinks his coffee and he gets his sickle out and he goes over with a wet rock and gets it real good and sharp and he starts he goes out stretches oh it's a big old field i'm getting ready to go cut it even while the the reaper's on his way to the field they're still wheat getting ripe in the field at that time see he's coming right now he's almost here we've seen his appearing brother brown said these things that you see are his appearing don't get it mixed up with his coming when he breaks the eastern sky one morning and that trump of god sounds and the dead in christ rises see then we go to meet him in the air but he's coming he's he is appearing now amen do you believe it and now how do we get there so what i was going to say a little bit ago is what's the whole problem is we've got mechanics but where's the dynamics see i was so glad to hear about dynamics y'all laughing at my my bandana here it's all right how about i need a shop towel or a beach towel up here where i sweat sometimes but so we've got the mechanics but i i how many heard the testimony i mean i better wait on brother matt to give that testimony yeah you better how about all right so i'll wait on that but i tell you what god is doing exploits today he's doing exploits in our time amen so what we what we're looking for is the dynamics so each one of you right now just imagine a saturn v rocket or whatever that rocket is that elon must come up with so one of those rockets is sitting on the launch pad and right now it's got a a pre-designated coordinates put into that rocket it's got fuel in that rocket it's ready for takeoff but it lacks one thing fire see it takes fire to get under that to take it off and that's you and i we what we need tonight we need that fire of the holy ghost in our life see we need more of him living in us less of us more of him dig out brother brown said this i'm going to read this to you making the valley full of ditches now he said i think this is it is this all right with y'all well there we go yeah that's it now he said now i saw a vision i see the way out i know what to do and i tell you brother today the church hasn't got the vision or they'd have more prayer they'd be more spiritual than what they are unless there is a vision unless someone can see the vision see the coming of the lord seeing the things that we're going through with see all these things that god predicted things that god instead of reading the bible we're reading love stories instead of reading that we read everything else we ought to be reading god's bible and on our knees constantly praying for god to help us awakening in our souls and crying out to the lord but we don't now notice and then when he said he's seen how the way out now he said the first thing i want you to do is go out here and make the valley full of ditches dig just as hard as you can dig for thus saith the lord you'll not see any wind or there'll be any rain but this valley will be full of water more ditches the more water what did he see he saw a vision of the spiritual rock what did he see he saw a vision of that spiritual rock that moses had already smitten and ben speaking to he had just spoke to that rock and it was ready to pour forth water when ditches was made for it to run in amen ain't that something and say that same schmidt and i say that same smitten rock tonight is here and it'll pour forth an old-fashioned holy ghost revival that'll tear he says shreveport i say beaufort and savannah and the surrounding area charleston two apart if you people will go to digging moving all the difficults out if you dig up against one thing uh the beer cans in the icebox throw it out and make way for the holy ghost every time you hit against a snag throw the thing out the deeper you dig the more water you'll get so what you have what you have to have is to make way for it amen no matter how much preaching there is how many visions there are the subject was there was then and the main principle was make ready for the water get the digits get the ditches dug that's what we got to do tonight is make way for the holy ghost to pour down make it in your house make it in your church make it in yourself kick everything out of the way get ready there's coming a gusher if you'll get ready for it if you don't make it ready for it you'll never see it now it's up to the church tonight got a nice tent here got nice pew churches seats got nice people got not singing we've got a wonderful savior but get every lay aside everything every sin that does so easily beset you amen amen how you like that so wait a minute so we got to do something oh my i didn't think we could do nothing absolutely we got to do something brother bam said it's for you he don't just come and lay it in your lap you've got to reach out and get a hold of it he told joshua everywhere you set your foot i'll give it to you joshua didn't just sit back in the tent say well he's already given it to me i got it yeah he did but he had to go out and take possession of it and that's just you and i tonight we've got to take the same possession tonight every promise that he gave to us if he promised you the holy ghost reach out and say lord it's for me amen if you want more evidence for you tonight amen for healing salvation of your children claim it we've all got lost loved ones i believe that's out there in sin we can just claim it tonight say oh god that's for me i'm claiming it for them job sacrifice daily in case some of his children might have sinned you know what god did for him he gave him every one of his children he gave them all eternal life for what he'd done amen and that was under the atonement of bulls and goats think how much more god will give you under the blood of jesus christ tonight lord amen hallelujah what we've got to do we got to dig out now also we got to get in empty we got to dig out we got to empty out you say brother branham i don't do nothing i'm a good old boy i'm pretty good i don't do nothing he said maybe that's what's the trouble of it it's more sin not to do that one hit me than it is to do when you know better that's right he that knoweth to do good and do it that not to him it's sin you got to make ready doing nothing is the worst thing you can do doing nothing about it oh my how about this right here netflix doing nothing facebook hours at a time come on am i talking to somebody tonight i tell you who i'm talking to joe had a shell right here oh my the time let me tell you something when they give a uh they talked to old folks a long time and they were doing an interview and they asked them what's the biggest regret you've got and what things they done it's things they hadn't done it's the biggest regrets they got they wish they'd done this they wish they'd done that i don't want to be on that day i don't want to be on that great day as we should have done this and we should have done that we should have took more time in prayer wish i had to come to church on wednesday night wish i had to come to church on sunday when i had a chance to wish i had to have more fellowship with my brothers and sisters wish i'd spent more time in prayer more time listening to tapes when i'm going different places i don't want to leave the little things undone but i want to empty up with the garbage and the filth and the trashes in my life i want to make way for that gusher that's ready to come in every one of us tonight let me tell you something god's going to have a bride that'll do that he's going to have a group of people that's going to clean up clear up and go up and write that down i like that hey man brother you help me preach back there let me tell you something just like that perfection i was talking about and i i use steps a lot of times i'm starting to lose my voice most people get about right here this is justification this is a hebrew as a john 3 16. this is about 99 of the church world they're right around here justification they believed on the lord that's right that's as far as they ever go and they're just wandering around in here with the rest of the world i saw a church one day it said come inside and get you some jesus just don't get changed just come inside and get a little bit on you you know how about come inside and exchange your life for his life he's the most unfair person i've ever seen the unfair god i preached on that one time he's so unfair because let me tell you i i supposed to get paid see i had a payday coming the book of james says that the wages of sin is death see i got a paycheck coming but he's not going to give it to me he's unfair see a real judge if you're a sinner if you're a murderer he's going to what is he going to do he's going to put senior prison if he's a good judge i don't want justice i don't want fairness i will mercy i don't want no fair god i don't want no fair god i want a god that's merciful because if i get what's coming to me it's the devil's hell every one of us but then we get some people to get up by right here sanctification that's very few people yeah amen very few people that's right sanctified cleaned out get all the garbage out of their life and heart forgive one another what are you doing you're emptying out getting this garbage out yeah you're hating the things of the world you're loving it that god's now he's giving you a new spirit down to justification see he's making way for the holy spirit to come in but see that's not it that that's not the whole picture that's not the vision god had see what is it the completion the baptism of the holy ghost see that's what we want right there we want to get the sanctification justification sanctification then come on up and that's the vision that god has for each one of us that's the vision he has for his church tonight not only that he's got another vision of a spotless bride and him fellowship with that spotless bride see jesus coming the earth was the fullness of the godhead in a body form we understand that but that wasn't the end result that wasn't he didn't just come to say well here i am he came for a purpose he came to make way so that he could have fellowship with his pride to sanctify and make spotless abroad by his own precious blood and the brother jason was just telling me that brother branham said that we are part of that godhead why because we came out of christ right we was in that original we came out of him we're going right back to him he's going to pull us right up to his side we're going to sit on the throne with him he's going to hold everything you went through was it worth it oh it was worth it all the troubles i which i don't remember no troubles everything it was all everything was so wonderful my my uh my son just had a baby and and the mother was um she was like uh oh i had it was so wonderful i love it you know and i was like you ready for another one she was like well because it was just it was you know she forgot all about the pain and my son was like huh i ain't ready for another one you know and i'm like well you didn't go through nothing what are you so worried about she's the one who went through all the pain but you see what the reward was to her it was so worth it she had that baby now it was worth it all the pain but we got to empty out amen so let me finish this thought here i'm going to close that says he that knoweth to do good is not saying um thing you can do do nothing about it and that responsible tonight lays at the live tabernacle or bethel tabernacle let's just say that and other tabernacles and churches in shreveport and beaufort god is here taking with the storm it ain't what you're doing then it's what you're failing to do let's do something about it let's dig with all of our hearts that when that day of judgment comes we can say god i did the very best i could and you know i did one had just a vessel now now you saw my emptied up one had just a little vessel in it and she had nothing her two sons was going to be sold for bondsman she had nothing else she could do with this little vessel of old wasn't very much she was at the end elijah said to her said what have you got in your house say just a little oil and a vessel go to your neighbors borrow plenty of them there look getting ready see before it even happens hmm get ready david heard the sound in the mulberry bushes elijah saw a cloud the size of a man's hand i hear the sound of abundance of rain oh i've read that many times i always shout i hear the sound see he heard it forever even first raindrop ever hit if god can only get some empty vessels that's right he said fill the house full of them amen see what god wants god has got to have empty vessels listen we've had so much doctrine amen to that so much doctrine so much ecclesiastical nonsense until we're down at the end of the barrel there's only one thing left turn to god in his word and if you'll do that get some empty vessels take out all the methodist out of them all the pentecostal out of them all the badness out of them and just get them vessels and set them up in the house then take from this vessel and begin to pour a man just began to pour she had enough to take care of her and her kids and everything else and pay off all the debts why just what little she had consecrated to god and following the prophet amen god send us a prophet that will take the word of god and will not take something else but just get empty vessels if god can just get empty vessels and then take the word of god and pour it into the person not some say oh i shook when i received it i spoke in tongues when i received it i dance in the spirit forget it forget it just stay there just stay there until it comes that's all till the vessel's full that's it that's the way you do it yes sir the simplicity of it the vessels was filled up how we could stay on that you know wasn't hardly enough in that vessel to make a drop in each one and baby took his finger like this just dropped it off on each one like that look back and it was full just dropped it off see that's all we need because it was blessed all don't take some seminary experience take the word of god and drop it in there see how it feel now this is how you do it get weak get empty empty all up and then and from then on it'll keep dr dropping and god will do the rest of the drop and you just do that you drop to your knees hey man i like that drop you drop to your knees and receive that with all your heart drop in your heart right now and say god i believe it with all my heart god will take care of the rest of the drops it'll be filled up you shall be filled with the holy ghost amen i like that drop to your knees and it'll drop in your heart amen you like that oh my i hope we could have that vision tonight i hope we can see the vision of what god has for us do you see the vision brother jason i'll turn it over to you brother amen you know in the sense of something being complete and you know i love that statement wrote it down that amen amen and then i thought well if it's an artist you know it doesn't really matter what the world thinks it's what he is in his mind god's family all i know is i want god to think about his family and when he looks at me i want him to see completion i want him to see perfection i thought about brother branham there you know in shalom talking about you know the the composer i mean when it when he's writing a masterpiece there and masterpiece and and shalom in different places where when you're writing a masterpiece you're the composer it only matters what you think and the conductor has to do it like you want it the musicians have to play it like you want it and amen i i want to have the spirit of the composer tonight praise the lord if you have uh a prayer request you're going to want to get it sent to me right away we're going to sing a couple songs and then we'll take up some prayer requests but i love that god came with a purpose i hope you absorb that tonight as brother joe was just coming down he made that statement right at the end god came everything he has done has been with a purpose he came to accomplish something because otherwise then it just becomes well why am i here why am i at church and i i thought about you know david you know the bible says that when when that man i forget his name now in the scripture when he when the ark was unsteadied and the man just put his hand on it just casually and and the lord struck him dead and the bible talks about david was angry over that and david wasn't david you you know this is a man after god's own heart you're never going to find the david i read about in the bible angry at god i see that as self-loathing i see that david realized that this is a trickle-down economy this is from the top i didn't care enough about consulting the word i took the word too casually and and that trickled down to a man who thought nothing more than just putting his hand on on something that he was never supposed to lay a hand on and i think about that you know as brother joe was saying you know wish i'd uh went to wednesday nights which shadow went to more sundays wished i'd have prayed more wish i'd have had more of a life wish i had to listen to more tapes i i sit there reflecting on that i thought about all my years and the age i am now and the generations that i preached to we were just speaking uh brother kenneth and i speaking just the other day and i think i was counting up we were in our sixth i think fifth i think we're in our currently our sixth generation of senior youth and you know i've seen a lot and one of the things that will break my heart faster than anything is to see somebody as an adult and i started preaching to them when they were just a child maybe dedicated them then baptized them then preached to them and they went from a child to you know a young a young boy and then from there into a teenager from a teenager into a young man or a young woman and then from there into an adulthood and married life and then they're having children and then i'm dedicating those children and baptizing those children and looking back to see all that investment of time all that investment of word and not just me i'm just the lord's servant but all of god's investment and to see it just disregarded to say my you know i i've seen two i guess what what breaks my heart is i've seen too many times where i'm sitting with a a married couple they're in there approaching you know middle age you know somewhere around in there got kids got teenagers and got regrets now because they never did the thing that the ministry warned them about and warned them about and warned about and preached to them i'll tell you something friends don't disregard the word of god take it seriously god did this for a purpose the lord came into our day with this message on purpose god didn't just save you for purpose he saved you on purpose are you glad for that tonight amen praise the lord amen i've got one request here that says please pray for some sick co-workers and uh that's from sister melissa let me make sure i don't have any other prayer requests i don't see any that have come to me so i'm just always reminding you that if you have a prayer request you want me to pray over on a wednesday night amen i was telling brother joe that uh normally on a wednesday night back in the day we used to bring everybody up you remember that seemed like ages ago kovet kind of took that away from us we haven't felt the complete liberty to bring it back yet but we used to come up and gather around here brother joe and i i'm a stickler for making them gather up close ask them sometime they'll try to hang back and i say no come on up here close come up here close hey man because i know when you get all those licks of fire together there's a power in that you love the lord have you appreciated the word of god tonight amen i don't have any other prayer requests that i see i'll look one more time before we go to prayer but i've got this one let's sing a song or two with anthony and then we'll i'll give a few minutes here i feel the po if you have a request get it to me if you're streaming just get it to me i hear the calm [Music] and i know his fear it's moving me oh yes to give my [Music] he speaks to me and i agree [Music] lord please come come and take control i feel the world oh can we raise our hands and sing it to him now i feel the pull i feel love oh we thank you lord [Music] [Music] oh it's moving me [Applause] hallelujah he speaks to me [Music] [Music] [Music] just play that i just want to say something on my heart i wrote this note down right at the right near the end his brother joe was reading that quote [Music] and you know whatever you do don't do nothing brother branham taught us that there's no way to come into the presence of god and leave the same person you came amen you will either leave better or you'll leave worse now that's a given that's from a prophet you don't come in one way and leave that way you either leave better or you leave worse and i think the most surefire way to leave worse is to come into the presence of god and just do nothing [Music] i want to invite you tonight to think about the word you heard god is striving for perfection he's he's he's he's trying to get to a completion and i i sit there tonight and i just thought lord help me have a fresh emptying out i want to empty out friends how many tonight want to empty out don't come here and just do nothing because you'll leave worse you ought to just say lord i want to empty out tonight and that way i can i can be ready for the anointing to come down and fill up my ditches amen friends we're going to pray for that i got another request here that came in uh from sister phyllis says please pray for traveling mercies for need and ken abby michael caitlin and luna traveling visiting in ohio this week amen you want the lord to fill up brother branham said if you'll empty out if you'll empty out he'll come in and fill up that space amen whatever you do friends don't come to a service like tonight or any service and hear the word of god that'll that'll prompt us to strive for perfection that'll that that'll inform us how that god has meticulously went about bringing you to completion i want completion i want completion i don't know what's talking about in a body change going home to be with god i want to find my life i i want this a lot i want to find my life on a daily basis emptied out of me and filled up with him if that's your desire raise up your hands the lord can see that that would be your prayer request tonight let's pray father we thank you lord for this word tonight and lord i just i'm not trying to preach behind the preacher but i just felt impressed on my heart to emphasize that point again we thank you for your word tonight lord and we're we're not going to come here and imagine we can leave the same not here to just do nothing i didn't come to just sit in a building and and and fill up a space and let everybody see that i was present then i just go home and i did nothing well when i do nothing then i leave worse lord don't let that be for anybody in this building tonight may we leave better lord may we leave improved say well preacher what can i do if i don't want to be guilty of doing nothing what can i do say god empty me and then fill me take me out of the way lord here's what i'm going to do i'm going to surrender i'm going to have a fresh surrender tonight because i know that you came with a purpose
