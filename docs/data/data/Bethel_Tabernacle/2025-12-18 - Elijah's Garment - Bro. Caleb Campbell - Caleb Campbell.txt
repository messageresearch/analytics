So just if you want to let's [music] just go right into the word tonight. We're going to turn into our Bibles. Had this thought just kind of stirring in my heart the last [music] several weeks, maybe even months. But you know, sometimes he just gives you a little nugget of inspiration and it might sit there for a while. Then he starts building the thought. So the Lord just inspired me this way for tonight. Pray it can be a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to go into the second book of Kings first. So 2 Kings chapter 2 and we're going to catch the first 14 verses of scripture there. And then your second reading is going to come out of Romans the 12th chapter. 2 Kings chapter 2 and verses one. And it says, "And it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went up with Elisha from Gilgal. And Elijah said unto Elisha, "Tarry here, I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to Bethl." And Elijah And Elisha said unto him, "As the Lord liveth, and as my soul liveth, I will not leave thee." So they went down to Bethl. And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethl came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today? And he said, Ya, I know it. Hold ye your peace? And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho. If you notice, he's giving him a way out. He's given him an excuse to stay somewhere. But he wants to walk with the word. Amen. He wants to stay where the word is staying. As your soul liveth, and as your soul goeth, I will go with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they came to Jericho. And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him, "Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to thee today?" And he answered and said, "Yay, I know it. hold your peace. And Elijah said unto him, Terry, I pray thee here, for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they too went on. We're going to catch that a little bit later. But they too went on. And 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view a far off, and they too stood by Jordan. And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they too went over on dry ground. And it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee." And Elijah Elisha said, "I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Thou hast asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee. But if not, it shall not be so. And it came to pass as they stood as they still went on and talked that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and parted them both aunderder. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind unto heaven. And Elisha saw it, and he cried, "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof." And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. He took also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. And he used the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" And when he had also smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither, and Elisha went over. Amen. There's just two verses in Romans, if you just turn with me, Romans chapter 2. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 12, I'm sorry, in verses 1 and two. Beseech I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto the unto God, which is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. I'd like to take a title for tonight if the Lord would just help me with it. Uh Elijah's garment. Elijah's garment. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just come to you, Father, this evening. We're just thankful for the word, Lord Jesus. And I just thank you for how you inspired my heart for this word, Lord. I just pray that you just open the book tonight, Lord. Father, everyone here tonight, we just have listening ears, Lord, to hear from you, Lord. I just move myself aside just as a Lord, an unworthy vessel, Lord God, an unprofitable servant. But would you come and would you just take the words that were spoken, Father, and may you just anoint them, Father. May your presence come down in this service and may it speak to us. We pray. We love you. We dedicate it all to you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you as you take your seats this evening. Amen. Just for some uh foundation here tonight. We're going to go through a little bit of the history of the timeline of where we're reading from there in Second Kings. So this this book here, first Kings, 2 Kings, it's describing this path that Elijah and Elisha were on. Amen. And if you go back a few chapters earlier there in First Kings chapter 19, it begins to describe some events that actually took place leading up to Elijah's translation. In chapter 19, God was going to have Elijah. Chapter 19 of First Kings, he was going to have Elijah anoint a new prophet to take his place. Amen. We're familiar. Elisha. And he was also going to anoint a new king to reign over Syria. And at the same time, he was going to anoint another king to reign over Israel. And if we remember, this is the same chapter that Elijah found himself underneath the juniper tree. Amen. He was he was running for his life. And at this particular point in scripture, Ahab and Jezebel were in control in Israel. And Jezebel at in the beginning of the chapter of of First Kings 19. I know sometimes we read it like a timeline, but this is about 10 11 years prior to that. Um [snorts] Ahab and Jezebel were in control. And Jezebel had sent word to Elijah because she was so angry at about what happened on Mount Carmel. how all of her false false prophets were killed and how how he had this showdown and how he proved that God was the god of the day. How how Baal was was nothing but a false god and how Elijah went down and he slew all those prophets and and she was mad. She was angry. So she sent this messenger to Elijah the and this message said at the tomorrow at this time I plan to find you and kill you the same way that you had my prophets killed. Right? So this is why he was in such a place. It was one of the lowest times in Elijah's entire life. The and you know the situation that he was in it was so overwhelming to him that he sat underneath that tree. Amen. And he just asked the Lord Lord please let me die. I can't even live. He He just had He just had one of the most supernatural things take place. You know, I love this story because, you know, sometimes when we're in situations like that when when we're just feeling overwhelmed, we can really lose our spiritual vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can really lose, you know, any any kind of any kind of foresight because we're just caught up in this situation of our natural circumstances. Amen. The only thing that we can we can see is the here and the right now. Amen. Remember Elijah just had this mountaintop experience. The the chapter before that which is chapter 18 in my opinion is one of the most supernatural chapters in all of the Bible. Amen. If you go and read it, he had you had the Mount Carmel showdown where God came and he brought down the fire of heaven and he consumed the burnt sacrifice and he and he licked up all the water that was poured on the altar. Then in the very next verse, Elijah slew every one of those prophets of Baal there at the book at the brook of Keshan. Then in the next verse, Elijah stood up and with the power of God backing this prophet, he made that declaration of faith. Amen. Where you know the drought of Israel had came and Elijah was the one who spoke to that to to Israel that they were going to have a drought if you remember. And it was three years. And then and then Elijah was anointed to raise up in that same verse and say, "I can hear the sound of the abundance of rain." Amen. He had that that fa that statement of faith. And and then in the in the next verses, it begins to describe how how he sent his servants out and how he would say, "YOU KEEP GOING AND YOU keep looking because their rain is going to come." I know rain. I KNOW YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT RAIN looks like anymore because it's been three years, but rain is going to come. Amen. You keep going and you looking. And that servant kept coming back and forth seven times. AND THE SEVENTH TIME HE CAME BACK AND HE SAID, "I SEE A CLOUD like a man's hand." Amen. Oh, hallelujah. You know, sometimes when you're in situations like that and God anoints you to SPEAK TO WHATEVER TRIAL IN YOUR LIFE, YOU YOU GOT TO LOOK AT THAT TRIAL. YOU GOT TO LOOK AT THE circumstance and you GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT CLOUD LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FAR AWAY. IT looked like there was a distance, BUT BUT EVERYTHING that they had need of was in that cloud. ALL THE ABUNDANCE OF RAIN WAS IN THAT CLOUD. IT WAS GOING TO GET BIGGER and bigger and bigger. And whatever circumstance you're in, IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE GOD IS GOING TO ANOINT you to overcome because we're overcomers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Elijah was so anointed. HE SPOKE TO THAT DROUGHT AND HE THERE IS A SOUND of the abundance of rain. Amen. YOU START SLAYING FALSE GODS IN YOUR LIFE. AMEN. Like he did, HE SLEW THOSE GODS. HE SLEW THOSE PROPHETS AND HE HAD A FAITH RISE UP IN HIM. AMEN. YOU START SLAYING THOSE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE. YOU START HAVING THOSE LITTLE VICTORIES and those little victories become bigger and bigger. YOU REMEMBER DAVID? AMEN. HE HAD TO GO AND FIGHT GOLIATH. BUT BEFORE HE WENT AND FOUGHT GOLIATH, HE HAD SOME PERSONAL VICTORIES THAT HE HAD TO OVERCOME. AMEN. He had to he HAD TO GO IN THAT SH THAT PASTURE AND HE had to fight a lion and he had TO FIGHT A BEAR. AMEN. And I I just remember just studying about that and how sometimes IN OUR PERSONAL LIFE WE GO THROUGH THINGS WHEN NOBODY ELSE IS AROUND. AMEN. WE go through things, you know, in our minds, we go through things that people don't see. Amen. And those are the lions and those are the bears. BUT THOSE ARE THE VERY THINGS that are going to give you the FAITH TO OVERCOME THE GIANTS IN your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says to his servant, "Go and do it seven times." Amen. [snorts] Amen. Then just a few verses later there in chapter 19, he gets that message. Amen. Actually, another thing that happened in chapter 18, if you remember, when the sound the when the rain started, God gave him a supernatural speed to run faster than that chariot. All of that happened in chapter 18. And the very beginning of chapter 19, think about this. A few days, maybe a few weeks later, he got message from Jezebel. And that message just caused him to get in such disarray that he had to go and sit up under a juniper tree. and he asked the Lord, "Lord, let me die." &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when we we all are prone to get into situations like that. Amen. We've all seen the power of God move in our life. We've all had mountaintop experiences, but we're all susceptible to living to to having those circumstances come and to feel overwhelming to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I believe that God, even on a Wednesday night, is ready to come and give you some spiritual mana. Amen. That's what I need tonight. I just need a a little bit of charge to get me through. Amen. I just need a little bit of mana. Amen. I don't want mana from yesterday. I want today's mana. Amen. Because yesterday's mana was free yesterday, but today I need what he has for me today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He It's spiritual food in due season. Amen. To sustain us, to strengthen us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So then in in the next verse there, verse 14, it reads, "He was ready to die after all that had happened." And then I know we're all familiar, but we love Bible stories, right? So this is all right. Then verse 5, it goes on to say that he fell asleep under that tree. Amen. And God had sent a ministering angel under him, and it said that the angel touched him, and when he woke up, he saw that there was a a cake baked, amen, in a cruise of water. And you know the prophet says in one place he put some spiritual vitamins in that cake. Amen. And then he fell back asleep. Amen. And the angel came again the second time. And this time he said I know that the journey is going to be very great for thee. And so it says the angel came and touched him again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And gave him some spiritual meats to strengthen him and he started on his way. Amen. God has times where he's able to meet you under that juniper tree and revive you and give you the strength to keep pressing the battle. Amen. And this example, it just goes to show you you can't live in yesterday's experience. I appreciate yesterday's experience. I appreciate what the Lord did for me then, but I need it now. Amen. I need what God has for me today. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter how incredible or how supernatural. Amen. Elijah obviously couldn't live with yesterday's man. He couldn't he couldn't even see it anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when Elijah was there in the middle of that trial, it says in in verse 8 of chapter 19, it says that he came near to Mount Horeb. And we we we preached on that here before. Amen. Mount Horeb, it's the mount of God. Amen. Mount Horeb is where God meets man and and and lets him be in his presence. Mount Horeb is where he gives him a fresh experience. Amen. It's where Moses came and met him and and saw the the burning bush and and it's where he came again and met him again. And it's where Elijah had these experiences. And so now he's coming to Mount Horeb, the place where he meets his servants. And it says when he came near to this place that God actually asked Elijah to express himself. I thought this was this just the Lord just put this on my heart this like last night. I thought this was a powerful point because you know we're talking about God here, right? God was the one he knew the situation that Elijah was in. He was the one who gave the mana to get him out of that situation. Amen. And and he was the one who sent the angel. He gave him the strength to get through the journey. But when God spoke to Elijah here, he asked him and brother Brandon preaches that you know what doest thou here Elijah? what are you what are you doing here? And Elijah expressed himself. Amen. And after that first time, God asked him that. Then he comes and he has this incredible experience, right? Where where he witnesses where where the fire of God came down and and where the the wind struck and where God sent the earthquake and he has this incredible experience and and then he and then he hears the the still small voice speak to him. Remember? So that was after God had asked him that and then he comes and a few verses later after that had happened and he asks him again he says what doest thou here Elijah &gt;&gt; so see there's God knows the importance of expression amen he knows that when you're in the middle of something he knows how important it is to express you to have someone to express yourselves to he crafted us in a way remember brother Renham teaches that in Christ as the mystery of God revealed that that he one of his great three-fold purposes is to express himself. Amen. So, if we're supposed to be like God, then we're supposed to express ourselves. And he knows that sometimes we're in situations where we have to express ourselves. And who better to express yourself to than the one who made you than THE ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO GET YOU from where you are to where you need to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he let him express himself. He didn't say, "Stop, Elijah. I know what you're going through. Stop. You don't even have to tell me. You know what are you talking about? I I know. I saw it. I was there. I sent the angel. I was there." No, he let him express himself because he knew he needed him to get past this hurt in his life. Amen. He knew he needed him to get to the next phase of his journey. Amen. So, he let him stand there and he let him express himself. Amen. When you're going through things, it's important to understand that principle that whatever question you might have in your heart or whatever hurt you might be living with, God has an answer for it. Amen. And you might not always get it right away and you might not always get the answer you want, but God has an answer for it. Amen. It may just be that God needs you to open up your heart. Cuz sometimes when you're in the midst of that situation, you're looking for an answer. You don't even need an answer. You just need God to come in and wipe some spiritual mana in your heart and just to just to touch you cuz you don't know what's wrong. Amen. You don't know why you're feeling that way, but you just need God to come in. And sometimes he just needs you to open up to that. Open up that part in your heart. There's doors in your heart that you got to open up to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very next verse, God then commisss Elijah to go to anoint a new prophet, anoint these new kings. But it wasn't until he heard that voice, that still small voice, and recognized it. Amen. And it was only then, it was only then that God told him what to do next. Amen. And told him where he was going to go next and moved him into this next phase of his journey. Amen. Our opening text there read of of uh I just leave that open there. Our opening text there, we read of the translation of Elijah. Amen. Who's on the journey to their translation? Amen. Who's on that journey? &gt;&gt; Amen. When when the chariots of fire came to pick him up and carry him off to heaven, but this was his journey to get across Jordan. Amen. And he could never get across Jordan. He could never get to that chariot before he first came to the mountain of God. Amen. And heard the power of that still small voice. Amen. And and you'll never be able to get across Jordan. You'll never be able to get to your translation before you first have your Mount Horeb experience before you stand on that mountain and you talk with God. Amen. It doesn't have to be a physical mountain, but you get into a place where nothing else matters because you're in a different atmosphere. Amen. And you're talking with God. Amen. And and nobody else is there. Amen. You're out on the green pastures and you're speaking with God. Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; And and you have this experience and he speaks to your heart and he says, "Come up higher." Amen. He tells you, he tells you who you are. Amen. Well, that still small voice, he gives you that revelation. Oh, this is who you are. This is what I have in store for your life. This is what's going to happen next. This is where you're going to go. Amen. He whispers that revelation in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just thought about kind of correlating something. And I thought about that, you know, Saul's conversion there on the road to Damascus. You know, when he was on that road, the Bible says that he saw a light and he heard a voice. And brother Random said the light was so bright that, you know, it even blinded his eyes. We know that. But to those that were with him, amen, those soldiers that were with him, they didn't even see a light. Amen. They didn't have the same experience. Although geographically they were in the same place. And although the Bible does say that they heard some kind of a voice, they did not see the light. Amen. So just a kind of a note this morning. People can be walking down the same path you walk down. They could be in the same church that you're in. They could be even hearing the same message that's preached. Amen. Amen. But unless you have eyes to hear, unless your heart is open to God revealing himself to you, you'll never catch the revelation of the light. Amen. because there was a revelation in that light. It wasn't just the light that blinded him because that blindness was temporary, but the revelation he received from the light. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so grateful God gives us those lenses to catch the light. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You know, something interesting about the historical timeline. So here there in first kings chapter 19 when um do I it was um first kings 19. So Ahab and Jezebel were reigning and and God told Elijah go ahead and anoint Jahoo. Okay just some biblical history. Go ahead and Elijah you're going to anoint Elisha. You're going to anoint Jahoo. and you're going to anoint can't remember who the third one was, but it was the the another king of another who was it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't remember who it was, but so he anointed three, right? So, but it wasn't until 10 years after this. So, chapter chapter 19 and then Elijah's translated in 2 Kings chapter 2. And if you look at the timeline, that's 10 years. So, or yeah, 10 years. And then it's not until nearly 12 years after Elijah's translation that Jahoo was actually proclaimed king over Israel and Jezebel was killed. If you just catching some of the timeline. But what I thought was so powerful was that God let Elijah be the one to anoint Jahoo because Jah was going to be the one that was going to kill Jezebel. Amen. Because the devil is going to try to torment you. Amen. The devil's going to try to think he he's got something on you. AMEN. BUT GOD'S GOT A PLAN. AMEN. GOD has a season in mind. It may not be in your time. Elijah didn't even see it happen. He was dead and gone FOR 12 YEARS, BUT GOD HAD allowed him to anoint the one who was going to kill and slay that very enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thought about that. I thought about just so powerful to me how oh sometimes we're going through things we don't understand it and and we may not even maybe see why or where but it doesn't matter because if WE JUST TRUST GOD AND WE TRUST HIS TIMELINE HE'S GOT A PLAN for everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. He He's eternal. He sees the bigger picture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then we see how God speaks to Elijah and he tells tells him that he has a man that he's going to find a man that's going to take his place. He said, "You're going to find Elisha the Tishbite and you're going to anoint Elisha because he's going to be prophet in your place." Amen. But again, the timeline, he had some training. Elisha had some training that he had to go through first. Amen. Remember my title tonight is Elijah's garment. And uh and and just just I I mentioned this already, but David, you know, he was when he was anointed to be king, you know, he was just a boy, right? But then after he was anointed, he had a lot of training that he had to go through, testing that he had to endure. Amen. maturity that he had to reach before taking the throne, before actually becoming the king. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, I thought some of some of the there's a song Brother Tony sings, I can't think of it now, but some of the greatest trials in your life end up being some of the biggest building blocks in your character development. Amen. Some of the hardest things you go through, although you don't like to think of it when you're going through it, to become some of the the things that help you mature and help you become a Christian. Amen. help you become the who you are and who you're supposed to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those times of testing because you're able to when you're on the other side of it, you're able to see how God used it. He used he used evil. Amen. So he uses it for his good. Amen. So he uses it to transform your life. Amen. He uses it to shape you and change you and mold you into the image that he sees you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I read um this little devotion thing and the this um I think it's the devotion that that you recommended that you u that you use. The Scottish preacher, he he has a devotional. He says, "My dear God, I have never thanked you for my thorns. I have thanked you a thousand times for my roses, but not once for my thorns. I have always looked forward to the place where I will be rewarded for my cross. But I have never thought of my cross as a present glory itself. Teach me, oh Lord, to glory in my cross. Teach me the value of my thorns. Show me how I have climbed to you through the path of pain. Show me it is through my tears I have seen my rainbow. Thank God for those thorns. Amen. I thought that was just so powerful. Amen. Elisha in this chapter, he was anointed to be prophet. Wow, that time is Elisha in this chapter, he was anointed to be prophet, but um 10 years later, you know, I I was thinking about this just kind of studying for this. You know, the Bible doesn't always tell you everything that goes on in between the lines, right? You know, John John speaks of that. you know, if if we had all the books in all the world, it would never express all the things that Jesus did, right? And like during that time of of Elisha's of training when he was walking with Elijah, right? So they walked together for 10 years. I would imagine that Elijah would sit around a campfire at night. Amen. And he would begin to express some of these stories. Amen. I I just just for a drama tonight, I just thought about how Elijah maybe would dramatize the showdown on Mount Carmel. how all of those hundreds of prophets were there calling out to Baal and trying to get them to to bring fire down and and then when it came time for Elijah to call down fire from God, the Lord inspired him to to trench it with water and then he called on God and the fire came down and then he proved how all those frost prophets and those people that that this was the living God. Amen. Or maybe he would tell Elisha about the time that that all that that that about that experience that he had under the juniper tree where that angel came and and met him there and gave him this supernatural mana and how he wanted he was in despair but he but he didn't he he wanted to lose his life but God came and and gave him instruction to go to Mount Horeb and then he then he heard that that still small voice. Amen. And and once all that noise was gone, he heard that voice and that revelation speak to him. Amen. Or or maybe he told him about the time that the widow ha had this child that died. &gt;&gt; Amen. And how [snorts] the power of God fell upon him and and God anointed Elijah to stretch out his arms, lay across that child, and then God came and and rose that child back to to life again. Amen. You know, we have some of the greatest faith, some of the greatest ways to build faith is to listen to these stories, to listen to to the stories that our Elijah gave to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, that's just a great way start listening to the prophet's life and and hear hear some of his stories, his life story, the visions and the supernatural works that took place. Amen. Because we are supposed to type Elisha. Amen. There, brother Benam talks about that. We type Elisha. Amen. And our Elijah did the same thing. Amen. He he tells us these stories like when he went to Africa and he disobeyed he disobeyed God and and how he had to go around and and and there was so much pressure from all those preachers. Amen. But but he still went and went ahead and did it. And then when he got back home and how he had he was so sick for so long or or or that story I was just listening to that story where where where this this boy I think his name was Oscar and he came to brother Brandham and he said, "I lost my horse." and he was ba way back in the mountains and and and the the the guide was making fun of him and he was saying, you know, you're never going to find your horse. It's been months ago. The snow is too thick. There's no way you're ever going to find your horse. And he looked over at brother Brandham because his mom was healed in Brother Brandham's meetings and and he says he says, "Brother Brandham, you know, pray that Oscar get his horse back. Pray pray that." And he said, and brother Bham looked over at him. He says, "Oscar, you believe that?" Oscar says, "I believe. I I believe that." And so he prayed and and the the the Lord came down and and and spoke. And then a few months later, he got a letter. Brother Vam got a letter from this boy that God had given him his horses back in an impossible situation. Amen. Those kinds of things. Amen. Build your faith because that's the rubber meeting in the road. Those are situations. Amen. When we pray, when we have need of things, we don't always have need of these great miraculous things. Those things can happen and they will happen. But sometimes I just need some I need some God with flesh on it. Amen. I need some God with skin on it. I need some um I lost my horse. I lost my keys. I lost this. I need you, God, to move. And then God will move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those those kinds of testimonies, they can really have impact. I mean, faith cometh by hearing. Amen. And hearing the word of God. There there's something in you that that that when you hear those things, you just know that that you're part of it. Amen. I'm part of this. That that's part of me. something calling in me that that's I know that I'm part of that. Amen. You know, but one thing about those testimonies, you know, they're they're meant to be they're meant to be more than just stories. Amen. They're meant to lead you to the God of those stories. &gt;&gt; You know, he says in one place in this sermon I'm about to quote, "We don't just need the teachings and doctrines. Those are important and we do need those. But what we NEED IS THE GOD of Elijah." Amen. In this this verse, I'm going to get into it in a minute. He He calls upon God and he says he says where is the God of Elijah? Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it takes situations where we need to bring th that reality into our life. Amen. To bring those stories and bring it as a reality into our life. Amen. This quote here, brother Bham says in the secondhand robe 1956, he says, "Now notice in Elijah then after he threw his robe on him and tried it on him." In other words, Elijah the prophet who had the mantle of God on his shoulders, he came down and he laid across laid it across Elisha the farmer to see if it would fit him. And it taken about 10 years to get altered to fit that mantle. Amen. You know, God usually puts us up in the shop and trims us trims us up a bit. He says now he says now he didn't alter his robe to fit Elisha. He altered Elisha to fit the robe. Amen. That's a powerful point because he says that's what he does today. He alters you to fit the robe, not the robe to fit us. Sometimes we want to make the robe fit us, but we can't do that. &gt;&gt; You've got to be let yourself be altered for the robe. It's God's robe. The garment, the robe is the word. It's God's word. It's a perfect word. Amen. Don't try to fit the word into your life. If you want the word in your life, then you step into the word and it becomes your life. Amen. Amen. It transforms you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got to bring us into that realm to make the robe fit us. Amen. He was transforming Elisha. Amen. He's trying to, it says he's it was God trying to bring him into that realm. And you know, he says that word realm, a realm is is a kingdom. And you know, it's God, he's bringing you out of the world and he's bringing you into his kingdom. Amen. He's revealing himself to us. He's unveiling himself to us to transform us to fit the word. Amen. And that I feel like sometimes that's the problem. You know, just speaking to myself, that's the problem. Sometimes we come face to face with ourselves, our faults, our flaws, and we have this opportunity. I've said this here before. We've had this opportunity to grow or to mature, but we can sometimes get stagnant in our Christian walk. We're not letting the Lord trim us up anymore. Amen. We can get so complacent in our growth. You know, Elisha here referring back to Second Kings again. You know, it was coming time for the translation of Elijah and God inspired him to go from place to place in this journey. Amen. Remember I spoke on that said I I was reading that. It says first it was Bethl. Amen. And then it was Jericho and then it was Jordan. And each time he got to those places, he gave Elisha a way out. He gave him that Elijah used that term tarry here. You see, he gave Elisha a justification, an excuse to stay where he was. Amen. God was giving Elisha the choice to stay back living in his previous experience. But he says, 'I want you to notice here, God is he's calling us to come over calling us to come up higher because and I I wanted to quote this on a Sunday school there if there's always a there's always a longing in your heart for more of God. Amen. There's always a longing in my heart for more of God. And brother Bham says, "If there's a longing in your heart for more of God, then there's more of God to fill that longing. God is inexhaustible." Amen. You think you've reached a place of complete maturity, God is inexhaustible. Amen. He still wants to trim you up a little bit. He still wants to transform you. He still wants to change you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a desire. He says this in that same sermon, there's a before there's a desire in your heart for more of God, there's got to be a more of God to respond to that desire. Amen. There'll always be a reason. There'll always be an excuse or a justification to stay where you are. Amen. But God wants you to continue to grow into his image. Amen. He could have justified staying in Gilgal because Elijah told him, "Terry here." You read that and you're like, he keeps telling him that, "Terry here. What are you, what are you talking about?" He's given him that way out. But every time he gets to a new stage in his spiritual walk, he he knew there was more of God for him. Amen. He knew that that he hadn't crossed Jordan. He knew that the garment hadn't been passed. He had been hearing about it for 10 years. He knew that this wasn't it. He knew he needed to keep walking with Elijah. He knew he needed to keep walking with the word as the word walked. Amen. To keep moving with the word. Amen. And he makes that declaration to Elijah, I will not leave thee. Amen. See, and and and I think I have this point here in just a few minutes, but you know that there was the noise of the world. They kept saying, you know, your your master, your head, he's going to leave. Amen. And there's always the noise and the clatter of the world. But sometimes you just got to you got to separate yourself from that. You got to ignore that and you got to just keep walking with the word. Sometimes when God is trying to call you from one place into another like when he tried to call when he called Abraham, he called him out of Amen. He was going to have to leave his family. He was going to have to leave everything behind because he had a position. Amen. He was going to appoint him a great position, but he had to leave something behind. Amen. Sure. &gt;&gt; Elisha couldn't think that way. He had already felt the power of God. Brother Bham says he knew there was more for him. &gt;&gt; And in order to get to that next place, he's going to give you he's going to God is going to give you the word. He's going to give you everything you have need of. But you have to make the decision to keep moving forward. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That you want to move into that next stage. The word is there and the word is perfect. Amen. There is no fault in the word. Amen. The fault is in us if we don't want to walk with the word. As he begins to express himself to us. Amen. As he unveils himself to us, as he recognizes that there's faults and failures in my life, I want him to tell me about him so that I can grow. And if I can come to this place and I look into a mirror and God says, "You need to trim that place up. But if I don't want to, then I'm at Gilgal. And if I do the same thing here then and I don't want to then I'm then I'm at Jericho. Amen. But you got to move to Jordan. Amen. You got to move across Jordan. Amen. There's more of God for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order for Elisha to be able to receive the garment, it wasn't up to Elijah. He said it. He says that it's not up to me. It was in God's hands. Amen. And once he got over into Jordan and Elijah was trans translated, the garment of that word was passed down from Elijah to Elisha. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want you to just catch this because that same garment that was used to part the waters in Elijah's ministry, remember when they walked across Jordan, he had he had laid his clo laid his clo coat down and and it almost like split the Red Sea and they walked across it. And this was this was going to be that same garment that was used to part it in Elisha's ministry. It was the same word that was parting it here was the same word that was going to part it here. The the the the incredible thing wasn't that the word could accomplish it. Elisha walked with Elijah, watching the word accomplish what it was accomplishing all of that time. The incredible thing was if he was going to have enough faith to possess the word and to accomplish it in his own life. Amen. &gt;&gt; The incredible thing is if you take the word. Amen. I know you believe it. I know you hear it. I know you see it. But are you going to possess it for yourself? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you going to use it to part the same waters in your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you going to use it TO PART THE TRIALS? ARE YOU GOING TO USE IT TO PART THE ENEMY? AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's the same word that was used to transform our Elijah. Brother Man is the same word that we take and we possess it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. There was a testing time. Amen. When he got towards the end of that journey and and and the testing time came to see if he was ready to see if that old Elisha was really gone forever. Amen. To see if that old self had really broken away from him. He stood the test. Amen. When the noise was there and he just he silenced the noise. Amen. And when he take when he crossed over Jordan and he and he took the garment, he picked the garment up. Amen. And and there was there was probably a lot of mind battles going on at that point. Oh, where's Elijah? Why is not why I can't do this without Elijah? How am I going to how am I going to do this without Elijah? But he they're that same faith that operated in Elijah came down in Elisha and he says, "WHERE IS THE GOD OF ELIJAH?" AND HE TOOK THAT same word and he parted those same waters. Hallelujah. Amen. And when given the opportunity, like I was saying, to to stay where he was, he said, "No." Amen. I want to I want to I want to walk with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time as as it's time to to to to really manifest the word in our in our lives, the reality, I want to be a part of it. Amen. I want the word to operate in my life. I don't want it to just be something I hear, something I see. You know that I have this in my notes. I just keep getting sidet. I'm sorry. But you you had all those onlookers. And if you notice when they went from Gilgal, those prophets were still with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when when he went from from Gilgal to to to to Jericho, those prophets were still with him. They still were there. When he went from to to to to Jericho to Jordan, they were still there. when they crossed Jordan, they were still there, but there was two that crossed over Jordan. Amen. So, a lot of times what happens is we can get caught up in I'm not talking about anybody here, just this is how the Lord put on my heart. WE CAN GET CAUGHT up in onlooking the message of the hour. Amen. We see, WOW, THAT'S INCREDIBLE. WOW, THAT'S THAT'S TRUE. I believe that. I'm going to keep walking with the word. That looks good. That sounds good. I'm going to keep walking to to Jericho. I'm going to keep walking TO JORDAN. BUT BUT WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR YOU TO CROSS JORDAN, YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT YOURSELF. HALLELUJAH. You've got to cross over. And once you get over there, YOU GOT TO TAKE THE WORD. YOU HAVE TO TAKE the garments that Elijah took. YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP FOR YOURSELF. YOU HAVE TO WALK AND LET THE Lord operate that in your life. It's not some It's not some crazy far out there faith. Brother Random says it's a simple faith and a simple word TO LET GOD DO THE WORK IN your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a harmony. Amen. I'm just going to preach because it's in my notes. It's a harmony between you and the word. Remember there in the church age BOOK, BROTHER MINHAM TALKS ABOUT THE HARMONY towards the end time. How there's going to be a harmony with the bride and his word. Amen. And and Ezekiel talks about that HOW AT THE END time he he sees this wheel and it was a wheel in the middle of a wheel. Amen. The middle of THAT WHEEL IS CHRIST. AMEN. AMEN. And and we're the spokes of that wheel. And if you go look at an old wagon wheel, as those spokes begin to get closer and closer to Christ, amen, because we're supposed to come into harmony with the word. Amen. As you get closer and closer to Christ, you're growing into that image. Amen. He's burning away all the desires of the world, you're growing. You know, Brother B says that in the church a book, he says that that that that you do what he wills. He knows. We know the will of God because we see it, we believe it, we walk with it. Amen. So, we just do as the word says do. Amen. We know his will and she will only do his will. Amen. And then, so as you get closer to Christ, if you notice, those spokes actually get closer to Christ. They also get closer to each other. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those spokes, they begin to get closer to each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a harmony that begins to take place. Amen. And that that's what's supposed to happen in the life of believers. Amen. We can always sometimes we can get so caught up in in that brother's fault, that brother's failure. And you know what that is? That is the devil trying to keep you from being in one mind and in one accord. AMEN. I'VE GOT FAULTS. YOU GOT FAULTS. I KNOW THAT. AMEN. But God doesn't want you to focus on the faults. Amen. He wants you to focus on him. He wants you to be in one mind and in one accord. Because when you get in one mind and in one accord, amen, the impossible begins to happen. What happened in Acts 2 and in Acts 4 WASN'T IT WASN'T SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE HOUSE SHOOK. It was incredible THAT THEY LEFT THE HOUSE AND THEY DID THE WILL OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's incredible when God can come into YOUR LIFE AND YOU CAN TAKE YOUR VISION off of the faults and failures of your brother and sister and focus that energy &gt;&gt; towards the enemy that's trying to get you distracted. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we're supposed to do. Amen. We're supposed to, brother Ben says in the contest, he says we're supposed to know the enemy. We're supposed to know his tactics. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STUDY HIM. We're supposed to study his glicks and know when he's going to do an uppercut and when he's going to do a cross. Amen. And when he does, you're supposed to recognize it and you're supposed to duck and you're supposed to change. Amen. That's what OPPONENTS DO. THEY STUDY EACH OTHER. And that's what we're supposed to do. We're supposed to recognize that that's the devil coming into your mind, coming into your soul and charge your spirit and trying to disrupt the harmony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's trying to disrupt THE HARMONY THAT GOD IS TRYING TO GET YOU in one mind and in one accord. Amen. As that wheel begins to go and it begins to go to the center. Hallelujah. Amen. And you get closer to that center. Oh, and it gets closer TO EACH OTHER. THE OPERATION just begins to be so seamless. Amen. It begins TO BE SUCH A harmonious uh thing that's happening. Amen. And that's what it's going to be when we take our translation. Amen. We're going to finally be into a place where I'm not looking at your fault. I'm not looking at your failure. You're not looking at my fault. You're not looking at my failure. I know we got them. I GET THAT. AMEN. BUT I WANT TO GROW OUT OF THEM. AMEN. I WANT YOU TO PRAY FOR ME. I want to pray for you. When I see you fall, when I see you're not living right, when I see you're not dressing right, you know, I don't I don't think in my mind. We all have thoughts in our mind. But what I do? I take that thought into subjection and then I pray for you and I say, "Lord, I want I want I want that brother I want that sister to come to the knowledge of the truth." AMEN. IT'S NOT A me versus you mentality. It's not a I'm better than you mentality. It's you're my brother, you're my sister, and I want you to come to the same knowledge of the truth that I have. Amen. Or that your sister or that your brother has. AMEN. IT'S NOT THIS GOD. IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING ON THIS PLAYING field where this one's higher and this one's lower. YOU'RE ALL EQUAL. AMEN. GOD IS JUST TRYING TO GET YOU TO BE TRANSFORMED, TO BE MATURED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Who wants that in their life? I want that. Amen. I want the maturity of the Lord. I WANT THE OPERATION OF THAT GARMENT TO take place in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They watched it from a distance. Amen. You know, it's we often we may not even realize it, but we're identified with something incredible. Amen. &gt;&gt; And rest assured, people recognize something different in us. Amen. They they they may not they may not they may not even realize what it is. Amen. but they watch your life. And not to be not this this to be a negative, but when when that life doesn't match up with what they're expecting, we ought to go back to Jordan. &gt;&gt; Amen. And make sure that we've actually crossed over. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to make sure that we're not part of the group like those prophets were that were just gazing at it from a distance. Amen. Because they watched the same miracles. They saw the same works. I mean, they were pretty close to Elijah and Elisha. If they were talking to Elisha saying, you know, your master is going to leave you tomorrow. They were they weren't just, you know, you know, in the distance. They were walking with them. Amen. &gt;&gt; But they too went over on dry ground. Amen. Amen. Sometimes it just takes us breaking free. I'm just sorry we're going kind of late. Lord, be with us. We're just going to have just a few more minutes here. [clears throat] Elisha determined in his heart to walk with that word. Amen. Sometimes sometimes what happens is we just need to break free from the influence a little bit like Elisha did. Amen. We need to break free from caring what other what other people think or say. You know, your walk with God is with you and God. It's not even with your wife and you and God. It's with you and God. And everything else is secondary to it. Amen. Sometimes we need to break free from the influence. Amen. And I just want to point this out here because we're all susceptible to to that influence from time to time. Sometimes it's not even a it's not even a you don't even know why. You're not sure why. You're just not you're not you're not feeling like you should praise. You know, there's just there's just some kind of a an in an influence. Amen. That's the devil. Amen. And we're all susceptible to that. And sometimes we're not sure what maybe people would think or say about us. Even in church, [clears throat] when you feel led to worship in a certain way or, you know, however you think in your minds that you're being a bit strange or we're being shy, like someone has their eye on us, sometimes that's how it is. It feels like someone's got their eye on you, right? But this is the house of God. Amen. And when we come into your into the house of God, and I'm not saying you got to worship a certain way. You worship however way you want to worship. Amen. You just let God do the one to choose it. Amen. If if there if you worship a certain way, worship that way. Amen. But when we come into the house of God, we're not here for a show. I am not here for a show tonight. I prayed and I studied and I there was nothing I could say tonight that would be a blessing. But I just yielded as a vessel. Amen. That God would come. Amen. And that's what you come here today to do. Amen. We're on the same playing field. Amen. We yield ourselves as vessels so that God can come and speak to us. Amen. We're not here for our brother or for your for our sister. I'm not here for you tonight. As much as you as much as I am here for you tonight, I'm not I'm here for God. I'm here for him to speak to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have one purpose. And and sometimes I like I was saying, it just takes a little bit of courage to break free from that shackle in our minds. And I just thought about this. Let me if you think about a a a wildfire or just a fire in general general when I when I was a before I became a fireman I had to go through uh the fire academy and they they talked about fire and the process of how it spreads. Amen. And it need it needed at this point when I went through it. It's I guess it's been like nine or 10 years now. It needed fuel, heat, and oxygen. Those are the three elements that are needed in a fire. Amen. And I remember when we were going through it and we were learning about fire, they called it the fire triangle. Amen. And that was that was, you know, because if you look at those three things, it's those three things that that you put them together, and that's what keeps the fire going. Then what happened is is a few years later, you know, I I graduated recruit school, I became a fireman, and then we're I'm just working. And I I started working with this other one, this other fireman, and he was just going through his recruit school, and they had made an amendment to the the academy book. They made a midmmitment to the formula. It was no longer a triangle. It was no longer three elements. It the because what happened was they recognized that if those three elements, even if they were together, they were laying dormant, it wouldn't always produce what it was supposed to. They recognized it took a little bit more. So what they did is they added the fourth part to this formula. What they realized is that it took some unseen force to bring the elements together. Amen. Just just catching some types here. Brother Brandham, I was listening to him last night. He's a typologist. I'm a student of brother Brandham. So, I'm a typologist student. Amen. Is that all right? Amen. So, you add they added this fourth part to the formula. They realized that it was that it was a a it took a chemical chain reaction of those of those elements brought together to make fire. Amen. because they recognize that they they could have those three things, but if there wasn't some kind of unseen force, if there wasn't some kind of chain reaction to bring them together to create combustion, then it would go out or it wouldn't even continue. Amen. And so, the same thing happens in our lives. We could have all the right elements in our life. AMEN. BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THAT unseen force to come in and to blend it all together. Amen. You got to You could have all the right elements. You could be coming to the church. You could be doing the right things, but unless you have all the right you unless you have that unseen person, unless you have Christ living in you, operating you, then you'll never have that fire. Because when that fire begins to grow, Amen. And if you don't take one of those elements away from it, you just continue to have those elements, it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. The fire develops and it develops. Amen. And you have to come up with strategies because when you're fighting fire, fire has a mind of its own. It hey you, you know, you can learn about it, but you also can recognize that it's strong and it's powerful and it it becomes like a wildfire. It just eats everything. It just goes and it continues. And it's the same thing in church. Amen. When we come together, we bring our licks of fire together. Amen. And if we can just put our mind into subjection to say it's not my brother or my sister, they're not thinking ill of you if you're going to worship. You know, if you come to the altar, you know, even if you came last week, it doesn't matter. God is trying to work on your life. And that's what I'm happy about. Amen. I'm happy that God is doing a work in your life. Amen. I'm happy that he's doing a work in my life. I'm your brother. Amen. I'm in the same wheel that you're in. We're we're striding together. I'll never make it to that center completely without you. &gt;&gt; And you'll never make it without me. Thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good thought. &gt;&gt; You got to be in harmony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When it comes to this message, the message in order for us to come into the image the Lord has for us. Amen. and and you know, we watch it transform our lives. It's it's applied. Amen. It's the application into every aspect into our marriages and our child raising and our family dynamics because this is just my last point. I'm five minutes. Amen. God's intention five minutes. Amen. We're going to close in five minutes. Praise God. Praise God. Okay. God's intention wasn't just to bring the message. We accept it and the rapture takes place. Amen. The intention was that you take the word, you come into harmony with the giver of the word and then &gt;&gt; to fulfill his work and his purpose in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants to operate. I have that quote. I was really botching it when I was talking about the church age book there. I have that quote if anybody wants it, but it just just to paraphrase. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. The bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word. She performs the command of the word in his name. For she has thus sayaith the Lord. Then the word is quickened by the spirit. It comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered. It comes to full harvest serving its purpose. So it comes to harvest and then it serves its purpose. Amen. You come to the Lord. Amen. You cross Jordan. Then you can actually serve your purpose for Christ. Your life doesn't even begin until you start serving his purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he wants to operate. I thought about the life of Jesus there. How, you know, he spent 30 years in training, but it wasn't so that he could come into his ministry and immediately go to the cross. Amen. He had a three and a half years of ministry of operating the word in his life. Amen. Jesus's ministry was that 30 years of preparation, but then three and a half years of manifestation. Amen. And the word is not supposed to be all preparation. It's supposed to be some manifestation. Amen. We're supposed to manifest the the life of Christ in our lives, in our attributes, in our character, in how we conduct ourselves. Amen. In how we operate, in our prayer life, in all of those avenues. Amen. And that's what I want for my life. Amen. I DON'T WANT TO JUST COME INTO THE LORD AND THEN GO. I want him to do a work through me. I want to fulfill his purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to manifest Christ in our life. Amen. You know, and you think about all those amazing experiences that happened during those three years of that Jesus's ministry is awesome. Amen. You know, and and sure, he had a lot of trials and sure he had to go to the cross and sure he had to do all those things that were very difficult. Amen.
