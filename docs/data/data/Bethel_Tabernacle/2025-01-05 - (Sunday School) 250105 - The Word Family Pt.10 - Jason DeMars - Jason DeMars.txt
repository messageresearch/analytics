========================================

let's pray Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and we want to just Commit This Time in Sunday school to you Lord may your hand be upon each one of us Lord speaking to us leading us teaching us Lord May our hearts be open to the word Lord and may your your life and your anointing flow through us we thank you for these things in Jesus name amen we're going to go ahead and continu Us Part 10 of a word family we're going to look at Genesis chapter 3 read verse 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can go ahead and be seated so as we begin to as we've read before and as you read through the Book of Proverbs you find uh throughout it that sons are encourage to listen to the teaching of their mother and of course daughters should as well not just Sons but in in Proverbs it's written to the son a son and so they're encouraged listen to the teaching of your mother hold it in your hearts and we find even that wisdom is personified as a female a Godly woman of wisdom amen the Bible says she cries out in the streets wisdom lady wisdom cries out in the streets and those gathered in the city Gates and calls calls to the simple ones to listen to her advice and correction amen now it's not encouraging The Godly woman to be a Street Preacher but that the wisdom that's taught within the home then is to be applied on the streets so that when you're on the streets you've been taught you've been established in the word then when you're out on the street when you're in public life you know how to behave and and and act because you've had a mother that's instructed you and taught you in wisdom amen Proverbs on the other side Proverbs also advises young men to stay away from a seductive and promiscuous woman don't listen to her words don't stop to speak with her and never enter into her house this is the continual instruction of the Book of Proverbs so young men be advised by The Book of Proverbs look for character isn't that what the prophet taught us your first and foremost thing is to look for character because that is the home that you're going to establish and you may you may say I never want to establish a home I never want to get married sorry you're going to establish a home anyways because you're going to live somewhere you're going to have a lifestyle you're going to have a certain type of life and and what you what you let allow to come into your heart and come into your mind that's the life that you're going to live and so if you you eventually let yourself in with one of these ungodly women out that are looking that are focused on the outward that are thinking about the outward and they're wanting to use the outward to and snare a man that's the type of life that you're building that's the type of type of home you're establishing amen though the lips of a wicked woman are sweet as honey in the end Proverbs tells us it's bitter as poison and dangerous as a double-edged sword amen she says she leads you to the Grave ultimate ultimately it's to Le leading to death stay away from the ungodly immodest girl or woman don't stop in the streets don't don't say oh I'm going to look not just in the streets now on the internet don't stop and look don't stop and stare don't let it come into your heart why because it's poison you're drinking poison you can't drink poison and not have ultimate results you might not immediately die but what it's what is it going to do just like when you feed your body with processed food continuously what are you going to have you're going to be unhealthy you're going to have sickness you're going to have disease just like we have in our society today going everywhere so you might drink the poison that doesn't kill you immediately but it's going to build a life on the foundation of poison amen the Bible says don't drink poison It also says drink water from your own well share love only with your wife that's the only place that it's undefiled and that it's pure not with strangers from the streets or strangers from the internet ultimately This Will Destroy and bring down a man so you see the picture that the Bible is painting you can bring a woman into your life and she can build you up and help establish your life based upon wisdom all right of course a man is to be a leader but nevertheless the atmosphere that you have in your home is also going to be based not just on your leadership but on the leadership that's received from the husband to the wife the atmosphere that's created there so if you want to build your house right seek a woman of wisdom not that doesn't mean you have to seek a woman who has a college degree what is wisdom wisdom is the revelation of the word applied to your life so seek a woman whose life is built upon the revelation of the word and as a woman seek to be a woman whose life is built upon the revelation of the word that is what wisdom is amen the Bible says now now that you have found the right thing it says let let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you and rejoice in the wife of your youth says to always be Capt captivated by her love right that's from a Godly woman a Godly husband and a Godly wife are to produce Godly fruit all right now but the immoral wife immoral wife what does the bible presented her as she's Brash Brash she's rebellious she's never content to stay at home she's always in the streets and Marcus markets and flirting with men everywhere now she's on the internet trying to uh put herself out for everyone else besides what's what where where is she supposed to be all right now we can get the PowerPoint going see here so as we read Genesis 3:16 I'm going to go ahead and look at it in the uh in LT then he said to the woman I will sharpen the pain of your pregnancy and in pain you will give birth and you will desire to control your husband but he will rule over you so so as we've established before God's original intention in creation was he made man first and he put him in the position of leadership he gave adam the authority to name his wife two different times and he gave adam the word to pass on to his wife and when Eve sinned when they both sinned he he said he didn't go to Eve and say what did your husband do he went to Adam and say what what have you done did you do what I told you not to do so the fall then produces this is the curse upon the woman so what is her desire now her desire is not to submit to her husband the sinful desire of of women is to overpower her husband and to usurp the authority of men so we could see then feminism itself is a result of the fall and of sin and of evil but then on the other side is you have he will rule over you and if you look at this verse it's speaking he will dominate over you so a man's desire is to rule as a dictator sinful desire is to rule as a dictator to manipulate and control his wife and his wife on the other side her desire is to manipulate and control her husband and this is a perversion of the word Proverbs 14:1 says every wise woman builds her house but the foolish plucks it down with her hands so a wise woman her through her behavior how she treats her husband how she manages her home how she builds her life what does she do he she builds up her own house she she encourages them she strengthens them but a foolish woman what does she do she she's nagging she's controlling she's beating everybody down to the point where they they they just want to run from her that's why you have all these funny uh uh Tik toks and and reals and the men are finding ways they they're going to the Home Depot they can't wait to get to the Home Depot they're getting in their truck they spend 16 hours in their truck avoiding their family avoiding their wife that's not the atmosphere that a woman should be creating when her husband gets home that should be the place that's his Oasis not the place where oh Lord have mercy here it comes again that's not the atmosphere that God wants to have in a home Proverbs 11 verse 22 as a jewel of gold in a swine snout so is a fair woman with which is without discretion it's quite a statement but God wants a woman to have discretion she wants to have her her to have discernment to understand what to let near her what kind of how to how to speak how to act how to behave how to order herself according to the word it's not saying that a fair woman is de facto evil right brother brandom says you're supposed to use your beauty to further the king of God right not to further selfish ends and to lead men to destruction Proverbs 21:9 it's better to dwell in a corner of the Housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house verse 19 it's better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and an angry woman it's better to dwell in the Cor corner of the Housetop and with a brawling woman in a wide house three times Proverbs repeats this so three times is like a an emphasis if if it repeats it twice it's emphasizing it if it repeats it three times now it's like saying hey pay attention we're shouting here now it's better to live alone in the wilderness in the corner of a rooftop in a tiny little home it's better to be alone is what it's saying so in this in in gen Genesis it says it's not good for a man to be alone but if he gets himself the wrong type of wife that's brawling and contentious and fighting and nagging better for him to be alone is essentially what uh Solomon is telling us let's let's again again we this is kind of marriage 101 every Christian owes their full allegiance to Christ we owe full obedience to Christ not full obedience to Christ if you're under a good pastor if you're in a positive church if everything is going your way then you owe full obedience to Christ no you full owe full obedience to Christ even if you have the worst Pastor in the world even if you have a manipulative and controlling Pastor even if you have a horrible husband even if you have a horrible wife even if your entire life is falling apart right in front of your eyes God doesn't say okay now now you your whole life is falling apart so go ahead and be disobedient and wicked and angry that's not what the word says so if you have a perfect wife then you can be a good man if you have a perfect husband then you can be a good woman no if you have if you have a a horrible spouse God wants you to walk and live with the right spirit and in obedience it won't be easy but the holy spirit is there to help you to walk in obedience Proverbs 27:15 a continual dropping in a very rainy day and a con contentious woman are alike whosoever hides her hides the wind and the ointment of his right hand which berth itself so what in the world does that mean let's look at the NLT to help us stopping her complaints is like trying to stop the wind or trying to hold something with greased hands so that that is a contentious woman you're not going to you're not going to close her mouth and you're not going to force her to stop she's going to continuously be like that now again we talked about I talked about that before a woman many times is a reflection of her husband so if she is reflecting back to you if by all accounts and purposes your wife is normally a Godly woman and suddenly she's the most frustrating woman you've ever experienced you might want to look in the mirror now if you married her and she was always orary like that that's your that's your issue but if she normally is doing all right it's a pretty good wife and suddenly there's a change it's probably something to do with the mirror it's probably the type of leadership the type of attitude the type of approach that's and she's just reflecting some or right back at you amen because as we said before the the man is the glory of God and the woman is the image and glory of the man so the man is the reflected glory of God the woman is the reflected glory of the man so she is reflecting back she's going to reflect the vision that a man has been given by God so he is under God under the headship of Christ he is to channel the vision and heart of Christ to be fully surrendered then she can Channel and uh manifest and reflect what she's supposed to reflect from the man things so we can know for sure things that God doesn't want to see in a woman number one lacking discernment about what is right and wrong number two angry or man manipulative uh behavior that always is ready to argue with her husband and ultimately she's getting in her own way let's look at what brother brandham speaks and now you see a little old man coming down the street and the little Jezebel with a cigarette in her mouth puffing along like that she say well she hollers scat and he jumps through jumps through to the door that's right and at night time she's sitting out there with them pretty red fingernails till it looks like eagle claws and been eating raw beef steak with it standing out there she won't wash the dishes cuz she's afraid the paint will come off while her poor husband is scrubbing the dishes after washing like that and her sitting in there sucking a cigarette and he's taking care of the baby right that's rank isn't it sounds ridiculous but it's the Bible and the truth just exactly right how could you ever eat a pan of biscuits with a woman that made them with that big long fingernails I couldn't I tell you it turn my stomach I just couldn't do it so anyhow but oh my it's all right but you little weakling man I'm ashamed of you as Christians Brothers will let your wife do such a thing as that it shows what you are made of made out of that's right now you women you ought to say amen after fussing at you like that because he's the ruler that's right and the way he let you live it's his fault God's going to hold him responsible for it that's right if you ain't man enough to take up and put your own house in order God be merciful to you that's right because the Bible said in in the very beginning that he shall rule over thee now uh now let's see now she's a she's not a doormat now she's your sweetheart see but you should sit down and talk to her and reason it with her and tell her and read the Bible and pray together these things wouldn't be in the church then if you done that that's right amen as I said before brothers that say well I'm not a teacher I can't teach my family right right here you have to be able to instruct your family it is your duty and your responsib ability as a man to instruct your wife because she's supposed to Inu instruct the children you have to instruct your wife and your CH children and lead them and teach them and show them in the Bible brother bham is not saying now you shame on you men you you need to enforce this in your homes now he's saying beat your family beat your kids manipulate them control them he say no don't do that you sit down with the word and you teach and you teach and you teach and you do it with patience the teacher in the Bible it it makes clear to do it with patience but you don't leave it alone if you have to teach on modesty for 365 days in a year to your family then patiently open the Bible open the message and do it we have no excuse and women that aren't dressing modestly shame on you but double shame on your husband because you're supposed to instruct when brother Brandon preaches it so hard and he's shouting and yelling we think suddenly this is how we have to handle it at the home I promise you that's not how brother brandham was dealing with it at his home and the scripture makes it clear if you're a teacher you must do so with patience and Men sorry you didn't know you were signing up to be a teacher when you got married but you were that is your duty to be a teacher of your family and to be instructor it's fantastic that we have good preaching at the pulpit but if husbands aren't leading their home the preaching at the pulpit is not going to do any B any true benefit in the long term because it is supposed to be established and put forth in the home by men so God's purpose is for a woman is she must be wise discreet discreet means to have discernment and judge critically of what is correct and proper as we as we've said multiple times before and as the scripture tells us woman is more easily deceived than a man however we can come and tell you that the gospel brings something different to the hearts of the people what is what is that the elect won't be deceived so especially in this hour that we're living in the Holy Ghost comes upon us that is creating and bringing wisdom and and discernment within the hearts of men and women all right God God's desire for a woman is also to be respectful to be obedient to be quiet and to be meek and these are all these are all not qualities that we are born with the natural man these things are foolishness to him but through the power of the Holy Spirit these qualities through prayer and through through the feeding on the word these qualities and attributes are developed and built within every woman of God see where am I at in the choosing of a bride brother brandham says for me I'd take not the pretty thing up on top the hill I'd take this character down here as you remember the story he's referring to he's referring to the rich couple arguing and fighting and and the poor couple where she loved him with all her heart and he did everything he could to provide and take care of her with all his heart and they loved each other he says I'll take that thing down there as a real Homemaker so somebody that loved me and stayed with me somebody tried to make to make a home and not bleeding you for everything for fineries and somebody that was with you and part of you amen I love that and it shall be even as it was told me he says well everyone thinks about their mother you know I think mother the good true mother is the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John mother mother gets them first and that's the one who brings them up first is Mother amen they Little Treasures that God has given you the responsibility of raising and I've always said and made this kind of a saying to mothers we know written of four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John but there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten that's mother she gets them before Matthew Mark Luke and John's teaching gets them so the responsibility is placed upon you mothers and you fathers to raise these children for the kingdom kingdom of God and I'm sure that's your heart desire uh again a woman is designed to be under Authority she's to have a Meek Spirit a Meek and quiet spirit is what what the scripture says Meek doesn't mean weakness Meek meekness doesn't mean a lack of faith or a lack of strength what it actually means is willing to be led the C the capability and the willingness to be led just as Moses Moses was strong he was a strong man of God right I mean he he had the capability of murdering a man right that was coming against someone he had the capability of defending the daughters of of Jethro he wasn't weak but what was it he was the meekest of all men which means he was able to be under leadership so a woman is is designed for meekness which means means she's to be under the authority of her father and then her husband I mean if you really I'm gonna have I'm just going to have to quit right there because I'm transitioning into another aspect of this subject of Womanhood and it won't do any good to just get one quote into it so let's stand and pray Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your your love for us Lord we thank you so much for what you're what you're doing within us Lord to conform us unto the image of Christ Lord each one I pray Lord that you would just continue to move and work in our service today Lord May each one musician those playing uh leading songs and preaching Lord each one may we all everyone get out of the way so that you'd be glorified and your people would be built up Lord we commit ourselves to You For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you
