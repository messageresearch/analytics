[Music] so [Music] first peter chapter five and we'd like to get back to what we spoke on last sunday we spoke on present darkness and so we just want to come to just another portion of that first peter chapter five and we'll just read one one verse here verse eight be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour you can be seated this morning we spoke last sunday on present darkness we took a lot of time to lay a foundation so if you missed that you could go back and grab that i won't do too much recap today because we just have a lot more again as we left you last time we don't have time in these sunday schools especially when we're running late uh to uh to really cover to to draw a conclusion or get to a conclusion but we'll we'll pose some questions today maybe cover some wrong answers uh rather than getting to the right answer i think that's important sometimes when you're looking at a subject or a question is to study the wrong answers answers sometimes are not necessarily entirely wrong uh but they're a lot of times inadequate answers to the questions that we ask and so we looked a lot last sunday about the evil in the world we we talked a lot about a heavy subject for the whole world and that was the columbine high school shootings and uh and we we spoke a lot about the evil that happened in a very short amount of time we spoke about the devil the bible calls him a adversary that like a adversary he's like a roaring lion the jesus said he was a murderer from the beginning and so we looked at the nature of him that he's a destroyer and so today we want to cover just another aspect of that and we looked at that columbine disaster and that was just one that we could have chose out of just many yeah i mean you you you the the list is endless of disasters that happen in the world they're at an alarming rate today all you have to do is turn on or tune into any news website or station it's constantly a negative news cycle whether it's a school shooting or a serial killer uh and and that's you know unleashed in a neighborhood and they can't find him or uh or a terrorist attack like 9 11 something uh maybe doesn't always happen on our soil here in the u.s but it happens all over the world all the time amen a terrorist attack a school shooting some horrible like the man who we spoke about that went into his work and shot up you know several people disasters are everywhere and they're not just human but they're also natural sometimes we have natural disasters like a tsunami that happened in japan and your mind will recollect and go back and and think of that disaster tornadoes i mean every single year it just seems like to me like tornadoes either they're reported more than they ever were or they're happening more than they ever uh earthquakes mudslides evil that's all part of the curse of what we spoke on last sunday that was part of the curse that was brought upon not just man but also the earth diseases pandemics yeah a a a you know whether it was coronavirus or the zika virus or the bird flu or the dog flu or the cat flu or whatever kind of next virus they want to come we want to have amen the world is full of evil diseases pandemics evil is present that's what we're speaking on and teaching on is present darkness the world that we live in is present with darkness and evil is present in almost every aspect of our life and one question that man always asks believer and unbeliever alike especially unbelievers one question that is always asked after disaster whether it was the columbine shooting or the tsunami in japan they always ask where was god where was where was god in all of it where was god in columbine why didn't god stop it and that question is always and today we want as we said we won't attempt to answer that question but we'll rather dissect the question itself and look at maybe some wrong answers if we if we have any time today that question on obviously assumes two things it assumes that number one god is all-powerful and it also assumes that god is all loving you see if you remove those two questions you don't have a problem if you don't believe that god is all-powerful they couldn't have done anything to stop columbine right if you believe he's if you don't believe he's all-powerful he couldn't have done anything to stop the tsunami or 911 or whatever the disaster or coronavirus so you have to assume first in order to have a problem which many people have created a problem that problem is where was god if god is all loving if god loves everybody why does things like this take place and so you also have to assume that god is all loving because if he's all loving how could he let how good a god is all loving let things like this happen and it's amazing when you look at the answers that not only non-believers but even christians even christian orators and radio preachers and different theologians it's amazing when you see the attempt and sometimes many times not necessarily as we said not always just uh the wrong answer com the wrong answer is not always completely wrong a lot of times it has a lot of truth but it's inadequate it's an inadequate answer it doesn't fully uh give the bible reason you know what i'm glad for there's an answer oh yeah amen amen that's what i'm really thankful for today there's always an answer in the word it's not always an answer that people like but there's always an answer days after the 9 11 attacks there was that question many asking the same question how did this happen where was god in all of this if we're a christian nation how could god alone it's amazing the result of 9 11 was a result of great unity and amongst many different people the tsunami in japan that tsunami that happened killed 50 times more people yeah than 9 11. amen it did i don't even know how many times but the amount of damage that the tsunami did to just real estate property was insurmountable i mean the world trade center was a few buildings that killed a large amount of people but the tsunami killed 50 times more people damaged wreaked havoc across an entire country and nations it wasn't just the nation of japan that was affected there was many people from other countries that tsunami affected the entire world took many lives affected many more people and nations but the biggest difference between 9 11 and the japan tsunami earthquake the two disasters is that the tsunami wasn't caused by a human there was no person there was no terrorist group to go after there was no mission no way to solve the problem no way to put blame on anybody this is what insurance companies call an act of god when it's simply really you know it's amazing they call it that you know we it's really what it means is it's something that they can't ensure against right and it's amazing because it's really meaningless it's really sad when you when you think about that i was thinking about the other day your insurance company policies written you know and it has everything that it doesn't cover and one of them was an act of god and you know that used to mean something in this nation because people believed in god and it's to me it's as meaningless as putting your hand upon a bible and making an oath to swear that you'll tell the truth that means nothing it's just cliche really all it is is a vestige or a remnant of our past of a godly nation but it really means sadly nothing today but they call it a a act of god and it's amazing because the horror from that disaster the destruction from that tsunami was massive as in any disaster that happens in the world the collateral damages we covered last sunday what was incredible to me when i studied looked at the documentary on columbine is the knot it was amazing that the largest effect the most sobering that affected me more than watching the surveillance of the boys you know shoot up the school what was way more impactful was the years of ruin that that caused to families even today the suicides and divorces and emotional trauma of those families the cataclysmic collateral damage that follows year after year after year and and the horror there's many needs that rise out of a disaster something like a tsunami let's look at some of those the first need after a disaster and we're just going to look at these uh one by one the first need after a disaster happens is a physical it's on a physical level and you look at we need medical aid we need to attend to the wounded you need to bury the dead they need food they need water they need shelter it's the immediate response after calamity after disaster is the human needs the physical needs uh we need food we need shelter and it was amazing there was an outpouring across the entire world after that tsunami of outpouring of first responders and medical aid and food and supplies it's amazing those physical needs quickly give way to emotional needs because the emotional toll and the damage that's brought upon after something like that tsunami or shooting or as we said any kind of disaster or crisis is there's always an emotional need of shock and people go into shock the trauma the the mental emotional trauma and the shock and they bring in counselors to try to help people uh you know reconcile what happened and those that are who really do suffer in a in a very much like a physical way sometimes emotional suffering is harder to bear than physical suffering after that shock is gone and the next emotion that is dealt with is grief and sorrow those that are lost those that even in that tsunami the stories that came out of it of this of the survivors looking for years have to this day have never found the body of their missing of their loved one they even never knew what happened to them no closure no news and after sorrow and grief begin to subside the next emotion that comes for a lot of people is anger and bitterness there's always anger after every disaster or calamity that happens in the world anger needs to be directed somewhere and there's got to be someone to blame there's got to be a scapegoat someone to look for people look for someone to vent their anger to and in this case because there was no terrorist group or human entity that they can blame god becomes the scapegoat and people blame god and they as they as i said they're assuming two things even those who don't necessarily even really know if they believe in god or not are quick to suddenly believe in god and blame god and that anger is someone they need someone to vent to so they can't blame anyone or any person no human being to blame and so the the scapegoat becomes god the tragedy after every disaster is that people either are drawn nearer to god or they're pushed further away from god amen that always happens no matter who you are if you're a believer unbeliever after every hard thing or crisis you're either one or the other whether you were affected even people who weren't in japan when the tsunami happened were affected in some way one or the other and it's amazing because we moved to the next the next need after disaster and it's probably the most important one that we're going to discuss is the intellectual need because after physical gives way to emotional and that emotion turns from shock to grief and sorrow and then that turns to anger and then that turns to blame we move to the intellectual needs and there is in every person everybody there is a need to make sense out of everything yeah it's in all of us we have to make sense as to why why did this happen we ask really deep questions and it's in every person two major questions that everyone wants to ask intellectually is first how how did something take place how did something like this happen you know especially when it's a school shooter or a shooting and how did it happen and we've gotta we've gotta we've gotta do something put preventative measures to avoid it and as we we said last sunday you know they're they're blaming guns and they're blaming video games after the columbine and they're blaming every tangible thing that they possibly can they don't ever get to the root of the problem and the root is that there's present darkness yeah there's evil bound up the bible says in the heart of every human being that outside of god the human is a brute beast amen that's what brother branham said said outside of that nature change he's just a beast and moral law and government is the only thing that restrains him sometimes it's conduct good parents good raising good family a good foundation good home good relationships and then outside of that a person is tamed by the government the laws and the fear of prison right amen but that really doesn't deal with the cardinal brewpiece nature that's in everybody before they're born again can you say amen amen amen and so first they ask how did this happen and then they asked what caused it and naturally speaking of course science always has a way to be able to answer this question well how did it happen well two tectonic plates uh collided or got caught stuck one with the other and then it froze and then energy was built and then eventually those tectonic plates gave way and that energy created an earthquake and that earthquake created a tsunami and then intellectually we would figure everything out of how it happened and the reason for asking these questions is that so somehow we can avoid it or escape it or at least have a warning against it what i find so amazing is the the the recognition of outward external things that we can blame and then we could go to congress and we could pass bills and surely and everyone it's like they're trying to they're they they somehow think it's really a futile it's just futile efforts of men but somehow if we pass enough laws if we put enough restrictions if we put enough measures in place but you'll never ever stop the nature of the devil he's a murderer amen from the beginning amen and the bible calls someone like a rory lion seeking whom he may devour and he's only proud constantly and he's used every kind of medium that he can and it's and sometimes it's harmless things like cell phones or social networks and any way he can bring abuse or emotional um uh in any way he could use any kind of tool that's why they i've used many times the words of the apostle paul when he says be not ignorant of the devils we are not ignorant of the devil's devices amen amen but his devices are many yeah iphones and androids and ipads amen if you live depending on how far away from god you live or not there's always a device that has a way to trip us up or trap us it's amazing that there's always a blame towards external things but never the introspective look at the human heart and that evil is a problem in the world evil is on every level and every pardon it's it's it's a it's a question that is constantly asked by the world how did this happen we're going to we don't have really time to look at where i wanted to go next let me just find my place here and then maybe we'll uh what time is it 10 55. let's stand we're not going to be able to segway to jump into that so as we left you last sunday on a cliffhanger we'll leave you on one again today next time we'll look at where did evil come from lord jesus we thank you father for this morning adult sunday school this time that we've had to be together lord it's sobering once again heavy things lord that we speak about lord but we're
