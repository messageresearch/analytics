========================================

I believe it was Paul it said we are written epistles of God read of all man when you're on the street and when you're at your work and wherever you are somebody's watching you and especially after you have said a major confession that you are a Christian they'll watch you much closer than and that gives an influence to the people that's around about you and we should watch what we do because if we produce the wrong influence then we bring reproach not so much of on ourselves but of all what we claim to be Christian we bring it up on Christ and no one if we would think you would never want to bring reproach upon Christ but the wrong act at the wrong time or certainly cause the wrong reflection towards the first that's watching you and every body is watched when you profess to be a Christian
