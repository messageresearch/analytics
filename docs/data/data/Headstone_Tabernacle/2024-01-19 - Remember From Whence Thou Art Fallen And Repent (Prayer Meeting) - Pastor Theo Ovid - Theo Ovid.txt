for being here tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn to Revelation Chapter 2 we want to read from verse 1 to 5 Revelation chapter 2 verse 1 to five take each service take each prayer session as something that is of between life and death is so important to get a hold upon what God is saying what God is speaking what God is revealing what God is unfolding Revelation chapter 2 verse one unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus WR these things sayith he that hold of the Seven Stars in his right hand who walth in the midst of the seven golden CS I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience oh th can not bear them which are evil and H has tried them which say the apostles and are not has found them Li and has born and has patient and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from when thou art fallen and repent and do thy do the first works or else I will come un thee quickly and will remove thy candlesticks out of his place except I Repent may God bless his word praise the Lord I have something that have been placed upon my heart and the title of it is remember from whence Thou Art fallen and repent that is what I have for to share with you tonight remember from whence thou had fallen and repent you know it's is an uncomfortable thing when to hear we are falling short of God's plan or God's program it's not that easy to present this uncomfortable part of the Gospel but this is just what we have here tonight and many times when we are confronted with ourselves that the man with the individual with you we tend to be defensive or we tend to try to justify why we are how we are but tonight I want you to put down all those defense stuff and all that self-justification tough and take the word for what it is the wages of sin is still dead God is not afraid to kill people God give mercy God give Grace as we said I believe it was Wednesday two million people came out of Egypt but God only saw two going in the rest died and not just died physically but died spiritually the wages of sin is still dead people dying in church people dying in the pews so we want God to search our hearts out because that is what to remember that is what when you start to examine your own self what have you fallen from this church age the Ephesus Church they had labored they had they couldn't stand people who were evil but yet God said I have something against you I have something where you're short you're short of that first love that love you had for me when you started that love that you had for me when you were Justified when I pick you up when you were perceived and everything was so different and you were testifying and it had that glue on your face but that glue is no longer there uh that passion to know the word that that cry to get into the spirit that F desire to please God is is no longer dear and you know we want to see what God sees you want to get the eyes of God if you're proud you wouldn't want to see yourself you wouldn't want to examine yourself there are people who like to examine others they could see other condition and point fingers and carry on but when Isaiah came into presence Isaiah said whoo is me it was an examination that came to the person in that words us know where is them who is me because I'm in trouble I I'm NE of you I'm a man of unclean lips and I need cleansing I need pan I need to repent to be at your altar and the prophet in Ephesian Church age he read the scripture remember from when Fallen he said God tells them to remember evidently something had left their minds they had forgotten something he told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin the origin of the first age was Pentecost that fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and The Wonder of it it was time to go back in mind and then in reality look how these words are placed it was time to go back in mind and then in reality in other words you have to stop with the thought first and then hit to head towards a reality back to where they could say for me to live is Christ back to Purity when anas and ZF were dealt with back to the gate beautiful what a reproach it is to drift from God and countenance those acts that defile his name let those who name his name depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for God for God look at what you once through in your heart and mind and in your life then go back to it on Wednesday nights you heard the exaltation you heard the word love the Lord with all thy heart all thy mind all thy strength and that's how God wanted because you could take God in with your mind hearing words but your heart is elsewhere God doesn't want that he want your mind and heart line up that you could correct serve him and worship him okay now what is the way back question what is the way back the way is the way of repentance the way is the way of repentance and you know when we hear the word repentance we think about sinner people who unsee repenting we don't think much of Christians needing to repent to truly repent and the prophet went on further to say if a sinner has to come to God by way of repentance then the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent that much more repent bring forth fruit me for repentance prove it by your life this is not as if you know sometime husband and wife have problems issues and quarrels and fusses and and it's sad I don't sign that this is right at all they're not talking to each other for days and then they stand back talking yes so that's not how things are corrected one person has to take responsibility say I'm sorry and forgive me and then we could normalize stuff that is repenting that is straight out thing that will not just start back so it's not as if we could sin fail God carrying with a bunch of nonsense and just start back talking to the Lord no he requires repentance because he has to judge sin his nature cannot fellowship with sin his nature cannot tolerate sin his nature cannot compromise sin the wages of sin is debt he told his son in the Garden of Eden the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die there was no question about the law of God he said you could eat of every tree but that tree in the midst don't touch it if you touch it eat it you die and he died because God have to keep his word so the prophet said bring forth fruit meat for repentance prove it by your life if you do not repent said God I will remove your lampstand a church here we go in that condition can't give light to the world it's light has turned to Darkness wait a minute brother over you mean a church like to go out completely a church could go completely Into Darkness and yet people come in there every Sunday the pastor preaching messages but the church spiritually speaking is in total darkness God will then take away its faithful messenger its faithful Shepherds and lead them to leave them to themselves listen this now repent quickly don't hesitate evidently Ephesus did did hesitate for her lifespan was not very long the glory of God decreased ever so rapidly it was not long until the city was in Ruins this glorious Temple was in a shapeless Mass the land became Marsh inhabited by waterfall the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a qualid village listen to this Aston astonishing statement there was not even one Christian left that lamp was rent from its place now it does not mean that she could not have repented it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but it must be quickly it must be a true heart cry to God in sorrow and then God will restore and the glory shall come again in other words you and I I we tonight the church we cannot look for God's glory in sin we cannot look for God's glory in unbelief we cannot look for God's glory if we haven't done all that we can do and the prophet taught us that is the mechanics when we can do all that we can do for example if you know you have something to make right you cannot really correctly be blessed until the right you have somebody to repent to you have somebody to straighten out you have something you're stole to take back whatever it is I don't care whatever it is but you have to know in your spirit that you have fallen from something you need to get back sometime I I think I preached something I was talking about get back on track get back in line the prophet saw a vision the bride getting out of order and he said get back in step and many times along the journey we drift here we drift here we we find ourselves on a how do I say a rocky road there not the Narrow Path some dirt road somewhere where we want to do our own thing we not willing to take up the cross and and come after him and go after him but tonight remember from when th had fallen and just remember repent he said now I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love I have something against you you have been patient lots of patience you have held up my name I appreciate all of that I commend you for that I've seen that you try them who say the apostles from them Liars they don't cope with the word I appreciate all of that but there is something I got against you that is you have left your first love not the lovely they left the first love you left here we go that love that you once had for them good oldfashioned Holy Ghost meetings and I sure I don't the black man is around but many of us in the early years had no cars to go to service and whatnot but guess what we wasn't missing church we had to get there anyhow and we wasn't getting there just on a Sunday we were getting there on a Tuesday on a Thursday and what not we find ourselves because there was a deep there was a hungering there was a thirsting it matters it was our life it was our energy it was our strength it was our all that is what it meant to us so you left that love you once had for them good oldfashioned Holy Ghost meetings and you begin to kind of slide backwards into that formal and our father nonsense if God yeah we go had that against this church he has got it against that one too because you left your first love I've got it against you and you know it's a shame because we as parents and if you have old parents and whatnot you know raise your children a certain way you see how your own parents raise you as a child and what that and then you are slack with your own and not only that I know there's no school of parenting there's no school of of of of a wife and husband or whatnot but guess what we could pray to be better husbands we could pray to be better wives we could pray to be better fathers we could pray to be better mothers and you can judge yourself in that way in other words if somebody want to hear about me talk to my wife let my wife tell you the kind of person that I am I can't come and say I am this I am that I am that I'm living with her if you want to know about my wife come and talk to me and I can tell you about her because I'm living with her I'm living as a daily basis I'm not talking about the church front what you see going to church in a church dress or you see me in a suit I'm not talking about that I'm talking about living with that person and God knows our heart God know the condition of our hearts tonight we in this room and we're looking for God to answer prayer okay we're looking for God to fulfill his good in our lives and if there are issues there those issues should be addressed and be sorted out because listen to this sometime ago when I brought the word warn them from me and and Watchman and a tower R the righteous War the wicked that doesn't just apply to the pastor or the preacher that applies to the home in other words we have children we should speak to them they don't want to hear they have to hear they have to whether they hear or for they have to hear what God thinks say write it on your door post put it here let hear to be morning in other wordss that is what we supposed to be doing when they were small growing up to to guide them and to lead them and so on afterwards they get big man and they want to carry on or what not that's little different but we still to speak to them and let them know what God's will is and what God wants so what's something I have something against you that's my complaint you once had a great time you let the world begin to creep in and you got acting a little formal and you see sin is a a real over I'm say boy run from it um it's like death coming it's like a fast car coming it come to kill you really come to kill you it kill you in doses it kill you slowly it kill your desire for God it kills your love it kills your joy it kills the desire to pray to read your bible to read your spoken with books slowly like a like a like a suant like some Vine like a tentacle surrounding the plant very slowly very light and then gripping hard and harder and sin have a way that's corrupt the heart in a way where your heart get hard where you're no longer soft and sensitive to the spirit now they get hard and cold and judgmental and that sort of thing that's why it's sad to me back believers who know so much of wor and you can't tell them anything because they're arrogant in their back condition you want to be remember saying my my name you got a lot of patience your labor like a m your labor you said my you left Grace and Faith and swap it for labor and works but where is the love in other words you're doing stuff with no love behind it you're coming to church with no love behind it you come like you're giving your husband a plate of food but no love behind it you trying to serve and sweep beh house and but no love behind it it has to have l behind it he said as David said oh Lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation where is them all night prayer meetings and tears on your cheeks when else have you crying cry to God my goodness the Bible even dust it and got covers in it you read old love stories and news and things and things that oughtn't to be allowed to be published and put in a trash can we Pentecostal people pick them up and like LOF over them like bunch of flies and a garbage can he said now remember a warning remember therefore from when thou fallen from when you come from from Pentecost you fell down to where you are now backsliding and repent and do the first Works amen and he explained this way in other words if you got a god-filled pastor fill with the Holy Ghost and you try to hold him under your finger and we excommunicate him don't you worry God will do it before you get a chance he will go and preach stones on the street before he compromis with all that kind of stuff listen to this one here now you got a pastor that really tells you the truth you ought to honor God and stay in the spirit and worship God realizing that you are going to be lost if you don't hear that head you are going to be lost if you don't don't do what honor God and stay in the spirit and worship God if you have a pastor that tells you the truth okay I'm almost done L sentur he said I have need of nothing or the voice said right now when anybody says I have need of nothing he could very well be saying I have everything or he could be saying I don't want anym I am full now you can express this any way you want it all adds up to the fact that the church is complacent so when people feel satisfied when people feel they don't need this one they need I need this and whatnot and you need to hear from the pastor and what not and you don't need Ministry and whatnot the person become complacent being complacent is dangerous and as a pastor I fought against that all my life all the year and that is why I love to bring the promises that you can be reaching out like how Paul said forgetting things that are pass I press towards the Mark I always see a mark to press something because if you see you get yourself complacent you are how to say it like a real Target for deceptive Spirit and the enemy because that complacency would bring you into the spirit of entitlement and under deception that you are okay and you wouldn't even recognize what and where you have fallen from and that is what this is about tonight I find it very strange but as I said whatever he gives me I will give you remember from when the for watch almost done it adds up to the fact that the church is complacent she is satisfied what she has she either figures she has it all or has enough and that is exactly what we find today what denomination is not claiming that it has the Revelation and the power and the truth I have groups fooling the people deceiving the people that they alone have it they alone as the bride nobody doesn't train that nobody in the world when you're there like the bride and I the bride all kind of catchphrases and S of foolishness and people believe in that light you got a man telling them that it easier to be a believe a man than to believe what God said yeah what denominations that claiming to be it has the revelation of the power and The Truth Listen to the Baptist they all have it listen to the Methodist they all have it he what the Pentecostal say they have the fullness of the fullness now they are all saying here we go TR trying to prove that they have it all they had enough yet is that the truth and this the part I want to get to compare this 20th century Church to the first century Church go ahead do that where is the power where is the love where is the purified church that with stod sin and walked with faith towards Jesus where is the unity you can't find it if this church has all it needs why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts if this I say this way if this message Church Malachi for message pastors prophets teachers evangelists Believers have all the Mysteries have all the knowledge have the series open and open book and whatnot why would they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it all and yet they had far more than they have to do question I'm finished just three more scriptures to read and we be going on into prayer Proverbs 9:10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding now we talking about repent from when th was do you know Judas repented do you know Judas was remorseful but it was too late is not repenting because you get exposed is repenting because you recognize where you have fallen and where you have fall short and I want to read this in Matthew 27 verse three speaking about Judas then Judas which had betrayed him Jesus when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priest and the Amplified say it this way when Judas his betrayer saw that Jesus was condemned Judas was afflicted in mind and troubled for his former Folly with remorse with little more than a selfish dread of the consequences he brought back the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders saying I have sinned is that I have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see th to that and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself and next scrip I have is Hebrews 12 verse 14-1 17 follow peace with all men and Holiness which without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently here we go least a any man fail of the grace of God least any root of bitterness springing up trouble you thereby many be defil do you understand that the Bible itself saying that you can be defiled by bitterness you become a defiled vessel by bitterness verse 16 least there be any fornicator fornicat is sin believer who not have premarital sex and having sex out of Covenant of marriage is sin least there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau so God Lin up fornicator profane with Esau who for one morle of me soul his Birthright for you know that afterwards when he could have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears so you could actually cross the line where repentance is no longer valid I trust nobody does that and I'm going to close with this quote and we a finish in your hours of death when the death angel sitting at the foot of the bed instead of looking out Dear at a hideous thing and know that you refuse to come one time then your soul become black and smutty no more time no matter how hard you cry Esau send away his day of Grace and didn't get a chance he went bitterly trying to find a place to make it right but he couldn't do it God called him the last time but you forfeit all your rights all your friends all your feelings and everything this morning to come here you forfeit your rights to kneel down here and talk to God I am Telling You by the word of the Lord that Christ said he that comes to me I will know Wise cast out now while you are here on the altar repent tell him that you're sorry for what things that you did that's what the matter today people don't receive the Holy Ghost when they baptized they just don't toally repent so it have toally repent God is trying to give them the Holy Ghost he wants you to be meek quiet gentle and that's the reason you get up with the same selfishness in your heart he says you got to get up from there a different person you got to get from there gentle quiet Meek humble God Spirit dwelling in you and look back here we go this is important and look back down the trail to see how far you have come to see you are gaining grown all the time that is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is love joy peace longsuffering meekness Gess patience Faith just repent and tell God you want that right now and there's the final God gave Abraham a promise Abraham believed God it was in put him for righteousness listen now and he sealed him the Covenant by the SE of circumcision and God give you a promise potentially that you will receive it and you are going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him at the end time but you see you have to get clearance under that deed and the clearance is when everything against it has been stricken off and you got the abstracted you got the seal it is yours everything is on it belongs to you and when we believe on Jesus Christ as our savior and repent and baptize and come to believe him here we go God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract which is the Holy Ghost right is the guarantee that everything that was ever held against you you toally repented and the property is boughten and you hold the abstract for the Assurance so friends God is the one to recognize our repentance and I said get on in prayer tonight see how let God search you you're not studying others you are looking to get that experience like Isaiah did always is me so we're going to get down this prayer this time I trust then that this will be a help to you a blessing J you this is what was given to me to share with you and I did just that remember from whence thou fallen and

bring us into divine presence Lord have your way tonight Lord pour out your spirit upon your people oh we bless your name can we just raise our hands Where We Are and just Worship the Lord and just thank him for his love and his grace and his opportunity to repent there's a space there that you could ask God for forgiveness ask God for the reconcile remember from when thou had fallen where have you fell from as a husband where have you fallen from as a wife as a mother as a father as a brother as a worker as a Believer where have you fallen from remember from when thou fallen and repent you

service by Sunday be like more like we have never seen before father and may you be magnified and glorified in our midst in Jesus name I ask it and as you leave tonight I want you leave for this Colossians 3 mortify which is to put to death Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection I want to underline that one tonight inordinate affection evil conus and covetousness which is idolatry for which things seek the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience in the which he also walk sometime when you lived in them but now he also put off these here we go Paul speaking you put off these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision or uncircumcision Barbarian skan Bond or free but Christ is all in all put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved BS of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind weakness longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man had a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do you and above all these things all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and this inordinate effect affection which the Bible highlights as one of all these stuff is an unsung and obsessive attachment to a person or a thing which manifest true uncontrollable love this term is uncommon in the dictionary but God uses it to highlight the excessive passion we might have for anything or people that we give priority to before him God don't want you to put but any priority ahead of him no inordinate affection may the Lord bless you and keep you and preserve you and looking forward to see you on Sunday God bless you we dismiss God be with you
