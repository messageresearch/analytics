John chapter 7 verse 37 to 39 God bitched about the older one but Paul when I'm Jacob for his services become on before we appreciate that how God used them mightily beat on God for that so readin Psalms 1 Riaan verse 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stands in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night he Annie shall be like a tree planted by rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper unless we sons 46 God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not be fear Dori would be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof Scylla dere is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the City of God the holy place of the tomahtoes of the Most High God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early the hidden reach the kingdoms are removed he uttered his voice it melted the

breaketh the bow he cutted the spear in sunder he burner the charge in the fire be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the heathen I will be exalted in the earth the Lord of horses with us the God of Jacob is our refuge or praise the name of the Lord and sin John chapter 7 verse 37 in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this make he of the Spirit which they should believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated keep your Bibles close to you we want to read another scripture just a little lower down which is our means eaglets up to 47 so don't wrap it by you and put it over too far oh praise God well listen tonight our title planted by the rivers of water or glory to God but I only talk abouts being shown and being planted that is make we're gonna plant you by rivers of water or glory to God and my inspiration dear is a river deer is my spirit flowing freely oh praise God hallelujah are you thirsty tonight Alleluia where are you planted tonight and can you swim oh praise God hallelujah one of the way we were that way can you swim oh praise be to Jesus hallelujah but a Branum in a blushing prophet when you see a servant of God get so sincere til he's on his face with his hands in the air prayin to God blushing because the iniquity of the people then you're gonna see revival start a man cannot Lee in the presence of God a church currently in the presence of God under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down and gives unction and power to start a move of God among those people that's got to be and what I'm saying tonight has got to be a move of God the prophets that the bride has not a revival yet I don't want real revival he said there has been no manifestation of God to stir the bride it will take those seven thunders to wake the brighter so we are promised a manifestation of God a move of God not a man move not man moving but God moving and what God move nobody could touch what God move nobody could interfere with or glory to God we have the assurance tonight that when God plans you by that River praise God your roots with not wither your knees will not wither whatever you do wanna prosper we're gonna have a bright so anointed so fruitful so pretty repetition Jesus Christ Buccaneer or give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah you say show me a man a Finney an ox a Sankey any of those who feel the burden of the people that would lay on their face and cry and pray before God send us another John Smith who prayed all night for the iniquity of the people until his eyes which swell shut the next morning from weeping till his wife would lead him to the table and feed him with his breakfast out of a spoon show me a John Wesley again a fireman snaps from the fire I will show you a revival or glory to God people get so comfortable in the message so I hope this message to others something from you tonight to shake you out of your comfort zone or glory to God hallelujah no Prince demon take over this message because sitting with the intellectual self because they could read and write and they read all parts and a prophet and God set this on a coach and a coat here but God promised a revival and I want you to notice something when Jesus looked at the temple that was the last day of feasts the very last day that always ceremonies and all the forms and so on and Jesus cried a very man thirst let him come up if you any might want a drink that's different he didn't save anybody want a drink he said if any man thirst let him come unto me a nobody shall flow rivers of living water or glory to God you may be seated praise God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God a river is not dead as you think because a river have life in it it have animal it have it have fishes in it isn't that right a river changes its course hallelujah praise God a river is always on the move so a river court always at a river there is a river there river of God called always have a river a river for his people and tonight we are looking for River healing a grip of joy I bring up deliverance but there is a river or glory to God hallelujah we believe that hallelujah hallelujah and every River have a sauce every River have a beginning I never allow going down destination the river don't exist by itself we

clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb and in the midst of the street of it and in the side of the river there was a tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and healing a fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were the heat another nation or glory to God so this River gonna be on the other side that River coming from the trevi throne of God and go in the center of the street and undecide of stuff and on that side of stuff and healing the leaves is a healing of the nation's and the bride will be in that city there be people outside but you gonna be in that city that beautiful city or give the Lord a shout Oh glory to God hallelujah [Applause] let me see that praise God so we see over quarter 90mm at a time here I forgot to put it on so we all the time you visited Oh hallelujah but a Branham he said no what I presume being that this is a Pentecostal sponsored that mostly a Pentecostal people and that is where I show my lot because I never did join any Pentecostal church nor decision church I don't have any denomination synteny nomination and frankly I'm not very much for it they can have whatever they want to but when you draw a line you see God don't like lines built in his church oh [Applause] you mean called Oh like that no listen it reminds me of a fellow one time has some ducks he cut their wings so they wouldn't fly out of the pen he had some ducks on one side and ducks on the other and water began to come in and the first thing you know the water got higher and higher and the Ducks got together and that's what we need to do let the waters go to risin and then the Ducks will get together and we are all in the same water so denominational biased and we floated out it went if we just let the waters get deep enough Oh glory to God waters to get deep enough that's what the bride needs that's what the church needs enough water to get deep enough let's go to Ezekiel chapter 47 Ezekiel chapter 47 or glory after what he brought me again onto the door of the house and be holy waters issued out from under the threshold of the house is what for the forefront of the house stood towards the east and the waters came down from under the right side of the house at the south side of the altar then brought he me out of the way of the gate not what led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that look at east swat and behold they ran out waters on the right side and when the man that had the line in his hand went for east one he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters under waters were to the ankles again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters and the waters were to the knees again imagine a thousand and brought me to the waters were to the loins and afterwards he measured a thousand it was a river that I could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be pass over and he said unto me son of man has seen this then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river now when I returned behold at the bank of the river with very many trees on the one side and on the other and he said unto me these waters issued towards the east country and caught on into the desert and going to the sea which being brought forth into the sea the water shall be healed and it shall come to pass that everything that liveth which move it whithersoever the river shall come shall and there shall be a great multitude of fish because these water shall consider and this shall be healed and everything shall live where the river comment so this river that's about the floor everything that touches everything that kept in connection with it it's going to live it's gonna be healed it's gonna be delivered it's gonna bawl free Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God amen you may be seated praise God hallelujah when the waters are being introduced the first several states ankle Oh hallelujah the second set

or this river of God coming the home ho glory of God you may be seated so how deep you want to go how deep you want to go ankle deep needy we steep how deep in God you want to go you mean there are depths he didn't just throw him in the river he introduced um stage-by-stage step by step when in measure if there was anchored deep when he measured again as needy he measured st ho glory the quad is a progression the pointed a depth of God there's a progression to go into this glorious River there's a progression to go into this wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience yeah is my spirit flowing freely or get the Lord show me [Applause] season four message what does dumb what does dull here when God gets ahold of a man the first thing he does is in the church is to bring it from worldliness to holiness he brings from death unto life it is born again it is new its its ideas on you what we need is a Reviver like that oh we are dip of the Spirit we had spiritual blessings and spiritual appraises but we don't need that no more we need a revival of the Spirit of the Living God in the hearts of the people we don't need much of a dip in the spirit or a spiritual awaken we need a revival of what we got not a spiritual awaken that brings mixed multitude but we need a revival that we sit down and shake down and cut the things out or give the Lord a shout people sit back and church and love with the pasta or glory to God I'm no man to bring a revival you got to bring a revival got to love with Jesus will give the Lord a show Oh hallelujah praise God people in love with your church in love with this system in love with what I have and what will I achieve that is nothing we seek a city whose maker and builder is God hallelujah may be seated he's I was in Puerto Rico a few weeks ago and when I see the Great Sea and a great storm the waves were higher than this Tabernacle and I said you know what it hasn't got one more drop of water than when it was perfectly calm but what does the Chile under jumping what does it mean it shows the trash out of it so if the church do a revival the church full of trash but when you seek or begin to stir when God began to stir and slow your spirit and stir your heart and brother elusive and break up the fallow ground and you begin to feel broken your spirit broken your good man broken or glory your guardians look at yourself and you say you got to die then look and take a selfie of your servants and a little good sense that's about to die or chlorine Oh God not selfies I admire you tell me to kill you okay the Lord of praise [Applause] what it just means be seated is a revival to shake it from from worldliness and the things of the world and bring back purity holiness of God in the hearts of the believers humility which is a lost word right now humility degree but you want to be somebody humility is a lost world that's creep up and I wish our humility is like why men men men shoot themselves they don't want they don't get a revival once in water here we go when they don't get a revival once in a while on their spirit yeah well what happens they become so carnal so indifferent till they get so style starchy and self-righteous all of a sudden is that I judge you you shouldn't move so this should move so how are supposed to move you telling me how I'm supposed to move you are my Holy Ghost you find so and you find so shut up hallelujah as many as I led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God or glory to God will be seated

hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we are free tonight priests are so watch they become self-righteous starchy and self-styled listen they read and study and that's good but in the thing we're talking about you know about more about the world it's good to know the word it's better to know the author of the world may be seated [Applause] [Music] [Applause] lemme dies by his Lazarus was so short I didn't get no water notices but a Branum talking to his sponsors Desmond responsive he says you that help me it is you that sponsored me I love you and I wouldn't hurt you for nothing but when I see you'd me something wrong I am duty bound by love to tell you [Applause] he said he is duty bomb I love to tell you you're wrong when you are drawing lines and not fellowship and with one another if our brother is wrong you never win them to Christ by shor them further pick him up when you've got loved one for the other the world is so testy for that friends God is love until we can get brother love we will never get very far with God we need a revival of love amongst the children of God come on it you could claim to love God and hit me [Applause] that is crazy you're worshiping God your Posse and you're seeing me and you don't wanna shake my hand something wrong with the God you worship that God said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for another [Applause] you may be seasoned today the reason why God put brotherly kindness just under the Holy Spirit because to get to the Holy Spirit to get access the Holy Spirit you have to open the window of brotherly kindness and if you can't break through that because faith to pull young charity it's based on forgiveness and if you cannot forgive you cannot access the dynamics or the charity my god I don't know what I'm going to say tonight I don't know what I'm gonna say tonight you may be seated back home I tell him the bull test coming maybe season yeah the bull test put a test coming

we got to get the channel cleaned out so the Holy Spirit can come in Holy Spirit trying to force his way but there's a big block the Bible said there is a river that made the City of God glad when the
