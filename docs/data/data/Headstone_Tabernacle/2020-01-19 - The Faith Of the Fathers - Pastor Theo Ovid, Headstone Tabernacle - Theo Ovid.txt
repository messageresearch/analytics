of the Lord what shall he do and he shall turn heart of the father's to the children and a heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a kiss sin mark 16 reading from verse 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature this is a commission this is Jesus own words and read he does believe them as a baptized shall be saved

pray that you bless this word and come and open it to reveal it unfold it and Jason we ask it amen you may be seated praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I have a chi context scriptures I want to read this one which is if he feels up to four and I want to read from verse 4 Ephesians up to 4 there is one body and one spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling there is one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but every unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men and now that he ascended but it is but he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens and he might fill all things and he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ that we all come into the unity of the faith and another son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body or the head of unto the edifying himself in love amen praise the Lord so we are so grateful to be here today and I don't want nobody downstairs that not supposed to be downstairs anybody sitting downstairs that's supposed to be upstairs I wanted to be upstairs you can send them upstairs nobody just s hang on I wrong downstairs let him be upstairs okay this last scripture here verse 16 it says for whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to listen that the effectual working in the measure of every part God wants you to be effectual in your measure listen you want your little thing that to be working right all the parts of your body if one part is not working right is an issue it may be a little something stick your finger here but it becomes an issue even though it's a little finger a little prick on your finger and it's an issue that affects the entire body well the little issue affects the body of Christ and what God want is to us to come to be effective the effectual working that means you have to know what pact you are playing you have to know what pat join in what part of the body you're in and you want to know if you are doing that well oh praise the name of the Lord we believe that we have a title this morning the feet of the father's another subject the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and have an inspiration there's going to be a unity of the faith that's my inspiration this morning there's going to be a unity of the faith we believe that hallelujah praise the name of the Lord all right this is in Jude another contact Scripture he said beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the feet which just wants to live in the scenes it was the Saints once added in some way it got lost some way it got thrown off it was once delivered and deucey fight fit active fit contend for it wrestle for it press for it those sit where you are and say this is it you want what the Saints had what was once delivered because what was delivered was the fate of the father's they had that fate hallelujah and this Jude was right after Jesus was long after Jesus died which was already past hidden the truth already met condition this is after God came down the upper room after everybody get a portion everybody like the belly button charge everybody else fired it's just much and non-believers gold happens in the church afterwards don't yell don't yell so so far down that here's a fight contend argue don't just fight fight asleep that is fighting with energy vitamin passion than other lazy fight that's real right the one to fight you want to press the one practice thing you don't want who you are you want about God one of you let me say that again you don't want who you are you want what God wants of you your husband like it this way that's your husband your wife like it this way that is your wife your children like it that's your children how does God love you how does God want you gone don't want a church you know he want a system clean of a church a church that this call back to the original faith we believe that so here yeah yeah yeah every see contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints for the a certain men not one man men captain on our where's the sneakin who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men at the description telling the grace of our guns as if justice and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ I will therefore put you remembers don't you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroy them that believe not tell all don't mess up with catchphrases cause a good work all the time he will kill you and destroy you if you don't wanna follow in the faith the same God that brought them out he judged him and kill them and the same God had bring people and this message wouldn't touch them and kill them too this is no game this is no practice the end real king is another rehearsal oh poor either but all these things happen for all examples to whom the ends of the world are come oh god I hear amen clay a man could i am and all what happened in the past happened for all our examples not for suggestion an opinion how are we think about it let me see them so you put them in remembers how the Lord having saved the people or energies of all could be free we free from saying or Pharaoh but it wasn't free from themselves did you get the free from Pharaoh but not free from themselves because themselves as what

some churches already have the mana none of y'all then we put you see by standing the honorable death and because they have that man they figured out yet that eruption and these foolish virgins believers readin and their Bible there'll be two in a bed one taken not to groups it if they are to clarify you think I want to be in a group but the back is between a bit cruel for you there between the feel but two groups so then to become personal I wanna know what your knowledge is going on if I have to make it I don't want to compromise I want to know that I'm being equipped in order to make it and then I start to understand all this rupture is not an external team it's an internal thing you mean a power a magnetism got to be in me and when the great magnet come ago just magnetized me of oh I mean the priests I have nothing do that you mean I don't need it pasta - he can't give me that magazine you may not come from the Holy Ghost you mean that when they read me upper room they went to be activated or magnetized with the power of the Living God it was not cylinder entity of room for it wasn't for taking notes and write down in a book it was for power and that brought the faith not around them but in them so that's why Peter said silver and gold have I none such as I have I have I have I didn't have it yet I had something else but when this power come I have it no you mean and that have to come into you power to lay hands upon the sick [Applause] and you know they have to recover not no it's not no perhaps not I'm wondering that I'm hoping to recover they have to recover because power is in your body I was in your spirit powers in your soul powers in your hand powers in your mouth [Applause] permitting Friday Willapa for time and we'll share with them about the unction of the Holy Ghost and how Ocean is what give your prayer wings with all the unction of the Spirit you see in words you're seeing the best that you know how and what not but when the Spirit comes upon you and put unction in your heart in your life your prayer is like active prayer your prayer is like charged prayer your prayer not going and with the new roof and bouncing back down that's not not that's not perfect unction when the pray of option is different Oh glory to God let me see if I can read it here for you what the holy was given for its second function to the preacher so I appreciate the preach without unction he could preach with enthusiasm he could preach with eloquence he could preach with intellect he could preach with knowledge but he doesn't have to have the

to be called and they can only recall from the book when he was until he was the book that's why he brought to the woman of the world and wait for Hadiya because he has a name so he could release her

invisible army that means a army that cannot be defeated hallelujah if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church so that's another level no greater

already yet and you this morning i anointed you but God put something up on your life for greatness my god God has put something on your life for greatness to be blessed hallelujah when when the blessing Rebecca they say may you be the mother of millions it wasn't watching no baby so much no no that was enough to know there wasn't generations to come you know what I was representing the seed of the righteous because the devil introduced a serpent seed and inject a wrong seed in the earth and God was interested and keeping the righteous seed on here so you are not normal you are seated do you hear that do you understand that evil wicked season yet in people's heart in people's spirit and there's also a righteous seed and as can kill evil sorry wicked one to kill you but he shall not prosper he shall not catch oh no back when a former get you wanna prosper Oh both undercut the mosque [Applause] [Music] for a push by God it's a keep seed inert you know around says this represent if Gordo cut the day short no flesh shall be saved because the Serpent's Eve multiplying all these sodomites and the evil spirits but David here was telling me in school they saying that um they're not saying girls line or boys line or girls toilets or boy stolen just toilets just lines they starting from the the primary school every lower level to bring them to this thing like an America they don't want to say male gender and females and agenda they make and gender I gotta even go ahead and put a new it that's Lucifer you know and these people have more rights than legal people you Tina will stop why I think they're gonna closes down because after a while we will not be able to obey their laws [Applause] let me say that again let me say again call your gadget the reason why eventually they will have to shut down the church this church and other churches like it is because we will not be able to cope with their loss it will be enforceable to United Nations who is written on dynamics to us unforced Lucifer's agenda for the entire world hallelujah but Daniel said I saw stone cut out without the hands of men that's a headstone that's the capstone that's the chief stone that stone is current United Nations cannot stop that stone or get the Lord I show no laws as popping that's done we know it's coming [Applause] um I'm gonna wrap up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the frame of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit watch design and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely thwarted today as when Christ which stood him his very effort to gain power over him in a desert Satan hates revelation but we love it will true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them so in other words he's not saying play defense he said play attack not only will never prevail against us but we will prevail over against them so they're not blocking again you're blocking on every block him block him block and know this when you come back you say enough is enough I'm going to take back from the devil what he took from me because we have a promise no divine revelation give us the authority to take back from the devil to pre-fall over the enemy but I'm talking about a man you may be seated it was drought so main Texas fall and they couldn't get water what and that man went even middle of the street shop down on his knees grease up his hands all man he said Lord God I serve you all these years sand on rim they said in know when that man dropped down on his knees in the middle street and asked offering this a new marine was coming afterwards our bunch Irena Turner means that they come because one man decide to punish these and prayer before court and ask god I'd serve you all these years or glory that God send on that ring Oh hallelujah when you ready to get God you will get God when you ready for preacher you won't get a brick true people do what they want to do if you have to get up late in the morning a fiber clock and the other check-in for a clock you'll be there for 4 o'clock because you don't want to miss that flight you'll want to walk in your list and anyway you want because it's not a burden to you yet but if you understand this is the house of God if you're understand you come to worship if you're understanding from the Creator atmosphere if you're understand know minocycline revival is that the people to bring revival if you understand that then you come in here to create something not to watch what's happening but the cause something to happen then your whole attitude and thinking and behavior becomes different then you want to be a participator you want to be involved in what happened in the church but they looking for fire to fall looking for the sick to be healed you looking with a blind to see the Deaf to hear I and I can't continue 19:33 God give around 7 visions which is just must come to pass before Jesus comes again it almost appears as if there's only what to left of that vision the last one America was bombed up craters not even sure of America will make the determination Russia have the bombs to handle America and Rome and other places it's already built just a matter time one of the North were divisions do was the one in which he saw the children in cars that has been controlled by remote there was no steering wheel at that time anything was wrong at that time cars were square there's no way you could imagine this thing on what not because what the vision is a vision is a profit goal in the future take a snapshot come back in the present and said thus here the Lord it's not what he's trying to bring the past is what already is because in heaven is already stretched out it's like the novel a book you could open the book read the beginning and middle if the other is a mystery book and somebody's tall and you're wondering who stole it you start the playing games with the pictures and the characters you could spin he was just fast fast fast and say gokokuji not still yet to kill this story he closed the book but you are outside the book you can go in any part of this story the beginning party and then party middle part well quarters like that he's outside the book so when the prophets flipped the pages and see destruction is not maybe it will happen he see Los Angeles sink and a part of a desert become a port city thousands of people will die he saw it but guess what he saw bright walking in step he saw you he said I see the brightest cold she's stealing to the kingdom of God so he saw you delivered he saw you sealed [Music] sealed yes revelation 7 I saw another mighty angel ascend from the east having the seal of the Living God and he was sent to see the hundred and forty-four thousand Jews from this tribe and that job and that tribe but before them Jews are sealed there's a bride to be sealed because God cut off the Jews to come to the Gentiles no calls about a color the Gentiles to go back to the Jews so time is running out on the Gentiles or glory the courts of course and a last message before the great and terrible day of the Lord hallelujah send a messenger before the great and terrible day to turn your hands back not to argue we right somebody's wrong that's not pretty missable sin for to turn our ass back to walk the feet of the fathers I do have time today to go wrong into the feet of the file Bob you were

like a micelle look at that target know LEM fellows seem different annum only fight no big the missile look at that target I can't miss that most pleased if it looked on with his sling Eddie no honey must David already see I can't miss that so he ran he's I can't wait to take this demo glad provoking glass this door I'll feed it to the boots when Corey said that it's a cut yet off for the cameras the ocean on the Sun upon David without Eliza cut yet you can talk to me like that I must say a small one but I'm still a son I aqualified the army but I'm Sandow treatments to cross no son like that

doc but quad gotta make you kings and priests and you want a green onion measles come up please Oh glory hallelujah oh my hallelujah this is the last message before destruction let me see it again this message that we are preaching that we are believe in is the last message before destruction destruction is coming the Prophet said the seven seals book is revealed at the tying of the seven thunders of Revelation 10 he had in his hand a book open and here it was closed back there and sealed and his open has been opened since that time of the season we are getting into the night the book is open now you see the mystery of this 7 C book will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh which in this message the 70s are being in the song and there's the messages wrote here we got it in TP and book form now at the beginning of the song of the message the miss of God should be finished at that time now we will notice the book of the mystery of God is not revealed until the seventh angels messages sounded these points will be important in the seals cause it must tie together it has wrote mysterious because Norman Owen knows it God alone Jesus Christ but it's a book a mysterious book it's a book of redemption I know we know that this book of redemption will not be totally understood it's pure for sixty teachers but at the end when the seven either begin the song this mystery he winds up all the loose ends that these fellows prove that and the mysteries come down from God as is the Word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God the mysteries come known as what as the Word of God so if the world is preached the mysteries are being preaching because the mystery itself comes down as the world now watch this you know watch no you see I'm not making that up that's it Stasi as a lord I read it to you out of the book the showman of the seven angels message the mystery of God shall be finished that are being cleared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who wrote the world at the Shonan of the seven church age the last church age that's where we are all the loose ends through these church ages have been proved that will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the mysteries revealed don't come the angel the messenger Christ set in his foot upon the land upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is a it at the time of his coming oh praise be to Jesus and we realize in the scripture over in Malachi 4 there's to be one like John and Elijah to whom the Word of God can come to and he is to reveal there we go by the Holy Spirit all the missions of God and restore the fate of the children back to the feet of the apostolate fathers restore all these mysteries that have been proved all these River I'm done for now but listen to this inclusion when Adam fell Adam fell from the image of God and on disobedience throwing off the image so I don't fell from the holy deal because they didn't even know they were naked because they were filled with the Holy Ghost that was hid from them do you do you get that when Adam eyes was open because of break in the world then he understood they were naked and adamant and put on fig leaves to cover himself when God came down in the evening time to talk to Adam as usual and say Adam where are you where I could see in your way as opposed to me he said I'm here hi
