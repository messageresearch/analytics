and also for brother Hugh Williams who has been going through some pain in his leg not quite sure what it is but the devil is a liar this morning and God is a healer he's a restorer he's a deliverer and he could reach each one at the point of their need right now so let's just approach the throne of grace this morning every head bowed every eye closed as we thank God for His presence musicians Heavenly Father we thank you this morning that Lord we could be in your house of worship we could be in your house of praise there are so many places we could have been this morning but by a divine summons you have brought us into your house Lord where you are king you are judge you are ruler you are Lord in charge of everything there's everything is under your feet law we thank you that you reign father we thank you Lord at all power of Lord is given unto you and with this power you Lord your tortoise tree would all I was in cordial poured into Christ them all that is in Christ has been poured into the Church of the Living God so we know the ground we stand on this morning and all we pray for Nigel Pereira who suffered a mild stroke and has to undergo the test father me the test Lord

and will never fail may you bless the reading of the winner may you touch us this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen [Music] do you know that song Gio [Music] your name Orion it's [Music] can we just take it up a little bit [Music] your name too you're mighty warrior to me [Music] now you happen even a house to the law this morning so I'd like to invite your attention to the wood if you would turn with me thank you musicians thank you for the Anthony to three portions of scripture reading Isaiah 55 if reading Malachi 3 and reading Hebrews 13 scripture readings this morning as they are 55 a familiar passage of Scripture Sikhi the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the LORD for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so as the rain coming down and the snow from heaven and return it not thither but water it and make it it bring forth and bud that it may give see to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it really Malachi 3 and verse 6 for I am the Lord and I change not and read in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever me the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning I have a title this morning my word shall not return for it my word shall not return void hallelujah and that word void means empty so the word cannot return empty the word cannot return with a result once the word is spoken something must come out of it even if you don't understand what comes out of it something always comes out of it my word cannot return void but it shall accomplish that thing which I please so there are things that would please God and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it so once God speaks whatever he says it has got to prosper it as got to come to pass and God through diverse prophets and time than dispensations and epochs and eras have sent prophets and messengers and preachers because the mouthpiece of God are his prophets so when God speaks through his prophets a true prophet kind of lie a true prophet cannot inject his own ideas a true prophet cannot put his own perspective on things a true prophet is commissioned to say what God put on his heart to see and to use his mouth as an instrument and that is what makes it a true prophet and when that true prophet speaks and it comes to pass then you know it's a true prophet and if you read scripture you cannot find a prophecy a came from a true prophet that did not come to pass it could happen in a month it could happen in a year it could happen in five years or it could be 400 years as a prophecy that came from Isaiah that a virgin should conceive and bear a child it was not an immediate manifestation of the prophecy but the prophecy had to come to pass because a prophet spoke it and once a prophet speaks it has got to come to pass or come on somebody say man and even when a prophet comes off to Cena even though another prophet is there and another prophet may be there if there's anything that's hanging over the fulfillment of it could still happen it must still happen in fact so when Peter walked out of the upper room he didn't refer back to the molokai he didn't refer back to zeti he went straight back JoEllen see this is what joeld was talking about it it couldn't happen in his name other prophets came after Joelle but this prophecy that joy and mana it apply to us can the church say man so-called because he operates in eternity and is not limited by time the way we see things is not the way God sees things and before God clock down to given the word about my word shall not return void he prefaced sit or lay the foundation about the difference between our thoughts and his thoughts he said my thoughts are higher than your torture so what am I about to tell you is because my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and my ways are higher than my ways so even if you don't understand them my word chill shall not return void it is not peace of your thinking it's my peace on your understanding it's the peace of your experiences it's not based on your emotion it's not based on how you feel it's not based on what happened to you if not be son what happened this morning it's not be so what the doctor said it's the peace that what shinu did it's not based on who your father was it's some peace and who your mother was it's some piece of how long in church it's peace under one factor that if God spoken it's got to come to pass it's very simple this gospel isn't a complicated gospel once God speaks it it's got to come to pass somebody preached back to me Oh hallelujah you may be seated for a minute I go back to and the Prophet preach for the blind man you pray for the blind man and I me pray for the blind man but the man had no feet so the man came back to the prayer line he came back to be prayed for and but I brought him said I don't have to pray for you again I want you to get that this morning he said I don't need to pray for you again I already prayed for you and when I pray for you it already activated something in heaven the brain is not the problem your head is the problem so you see it go back to work go back to what you do and begin to see my stripes I'm healing because you already healed up I can't take it black you didn't hear it again it's already the truth no one has already gone water your healing has been declared of your deliverance has been declared your breakthrough has been declared when God said we see here oh holy awesome he was not just speaking to Peter he was not just speaking Sir John he was not just to get the poor but he was speaking to you Jesus himself said receive you know Holy Ghost and when that word left his motor that word waited until you came along and waited until Paul was there and waited until all come on somebody tweets back to me [Applause] don't try to lock my god in any day and time you can't lock him in this you can't lock him in time he's an eternal God he doesn't understand our limitations if thoughts I hired at all talks of his ways I hired at all ways Oh somebody preached back to me this morning [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah no one but a Branham said we ought to be reckless I'm CLS and feet meaning you have an attitude that you'd already care anymore because your feet is what's propelling you it will have to make sense to you it's not supposed to make sense everything and that makes sense as well eternity Gordon loves to do foolishness the max don't have to add up when Jesus came the match didn't add up five lawns to fish feeds life closed them remain the twelve baskets the match does not have to add up we have to take God at His Word stop trying to figure it out stop trying to look at your past and say I don't think I'm gonna make it your past have nothing to do with where you are now and where you are calling God is able to take anybody tell them with the Holy Ghost he could take your sadness into gladness and he does not need permission he does not need permission he could do it this morning and he is doing it this morning [Applause] [Music] you may be seated your healing is not based on merit of your understanding your healing is not peace and the merit of your revelation your healing is based on one thing that's feet it's just one condition God requires the heel and that's feet so you can walk in this morning in all kind of condition that's why the Prophet said prostitutes we're coming to the tabernacle he didn't know the scriptures he didn't they won the effort along preaching but they had to see God in the reality of a present tense of ministry and saying yes that's me I have female condition I'm going back different I have a latest going back different high sugar finish Lord Sugar finish high pressure finish law professor finish my China trouble finish finish finish finish you've got to speak it declare it walking it you may be seated so the man who the Prophet prayed for didn't miss my desk keeps him by stripes on here it was looking crazy but I like sit listen people can see that he was still not seeing but he's seeing something that was contrary to what they were seeing he was seeing something contrary to how he was feeling he was saying something contrary nobody talked to us him but he did not care because something spoke to him just keep saying it just ten feet worship God has nothing to do with your feelings nothing to do with your tiredness nothing to do it what happened [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] halleluyah halleluyah friends it it has to come real to you this is the first thing you have for the week that's real when you come to chill that's when it's real everything else is imaginary everything else is free everything else is temporary everything else has nothing to do with the real picture everything else is deception everything else is lies because the devil is the father of lies technology's alive systems is a lie traffic is a lies what traffic you're talking about what are you talking about Phillip was caught up and there's an Ethiopian eunuch and he people get from here to there what traffic you're talking about he didn't even leave a camel he didn't need a horse one minute he was here the next place he was there what existence was he in what plane was he in what I mentioned was he him what are you talking about somebody preach back to me this morning [Applause] hallelujah the doctors want to know what this thing is when the centaurian come to Jesus and say could master my servant is sick my servant in trouble he didn't come for a family member for you to come to my house I'm in trouble my hosts in trouble I wouldn't want to bring your Your Majesty into my house but I have feed this morning somehow I believe because I know when I tell one two Coreys supposed to go when I tell one to come he supposed to come just speak the word and I know my son will be healed where are the mothers in the house who have hit like that just speak toward this morning and my daughter will be deliver yes speak the word this morning and my son will be delivered just speak the word this morning and my family will be delivered [Applause] and the church say Amen hallelujah and his speech was so real now when he was heading back to the house but a JSON he didn't ask if he was healed he asked when what time we gotta check the tank I checked the time when the word was spoken I want to know how fast this thing girls would I want to know how fast his signals were can the church it must become real to you let's pick up life to you that you are creatures of eternity trapped in time what does your pills have to do with how you feel this morning you come the chip and a random piece of mine so why are we so tossed about your mortgage saw Cydia your bills tossing you the doctor's report personalized tour Sidney what are you talking about because it woman with the issue of blood she had went my doctors and they I tried to help her because they were taking her money it was only when our money was done and she was homeless again see back back was against the wall hurry you wanna put it and she will get a rock and a hard place and she had no other options sometimes that would cause love you know when you have no other options some of us have too much options so we get desperate enough yet or somebody help me this morning so when it came to the spot that she ran out of options she's not to look around where could I go what can I do what shall I do she said yeah somebody later hear about Jesus who is Jesus you hear about Jesus you know about Jesus it is said that when you get to Jesus you could be healed in this everything here a blind man I open I guess I believe she would have had to hear something to move off from her condition - try Jesus but when she got there she was new only one who hood so Jesus surrounded its crowd it's all kind of people and like some of us she said you say you know what is that's too much it's too much better come back too much too much people just wait for what I wanted them you everybody Savannah grab some food please later on today sell wings and everything you ever see like people willing to wait we gotta find any wings good without worry wait wait two hours because they want that thing people want nothing so much it will wait to us with our prom people this is that people leave San Fernando to come to Porter's mean to get that wings and eyeliner for two hours the journey alone is five hours is the whole trip to enjoy this thing for 15 minutes in so when this woman came down here and see Jesus only crowd she tell herself I come too far to just right back ooh and the Bible says she's had to press away and she told herself if I could just touch the hem of His garment no Jesus never spoke to her this is what make this testimony so powerful oh Jesus did not speak to her she didn't give up promise if you come and meet me I'll meet you there that was not the promise she told herself if I could just touch the hem of his government I will be made whole she made a word to herself and she kept you word to herself and she's not to press holy he didn't matter who was next to her who was there gets quiet who was here for observation was here taking notes she had a need and her need was greater than what other people around her so she pushed past him how great is your need this morning how great is your need is morning hallelujah my so my word shall not return void hallelujah hallelujah how many had a rough week this week there's only one person to be knows this or they might be non listener but everybody Niko put up two hands is and that's time that's all rachel job didn't have a hard week job had a hard place a trying way he lost everything and when he lost he think that wasn't he naturally has a losing me physically that I get sick I said I get so bad II that's a loose income use everything any wife see why don't just go ahead and we get him surance money but the Bible says that the suffering that is present time because people suffering is not people know that's walk in a sovereign alone but at his suffering that is president I'm not worried to be compared with the glory that will be revealed so in other words to get the glory you have to go to the suffering so that's why the Bible says the issue that is suffering you know but count it all joy so the next question is who had joy through that trial this week [Music] I've seen a different configuration events Nicole Lurie listen God loves on his theorem Peter was a fisherman and i'm sure i can assume when peter fell any water after he was walking on water Peter say well my dad's backstroke back to boot so I do look to buy Peter say listen I'm drowning enough Peter I forget about Ruben forget about all he would have learned as a fisherman because what he had stepped out on was new territory if he was walking on the water and he was honestly sir enough to say I need help when Jacob was left alone and he was battling with the Angely interesting who are you in other words tell me what you're really going to say well I'm a DC varmint supplanter I'm busy see no your name will be changed because you overcome but it's okay to let God know lord I need help no this temper thing this temper thing this annoyed thing every time again again easily agitated you can imagine if quad was easily agitated you just had no patience you know but it's gospel and these tragedies that get us to get patience put your knowledge temperance patience godliness and then quarters designee child he himself sign off on each other for brotherly Canada because I hear it you're the age to test and to trial and you will have to do it over and over again until you say yes that's it you know behaving itself like a son because power has to come power has to come and feature how poor you have to have character and the police are trying is when you feel or your door feel like doing and still do that's what is sacrifice of praise is you know back in the old days his sacrifice was bringing me lamb and and but this sacrifice you know is is is when you don't want to do but you still do so you don't feel like worship it II don't feel your your body your hand given your trouble and but but a brand said when you lift your hand you defy gravity such as the actor live in your hand is defining laws of this world you defying gravity when you lift your hands you identify yourself as a worshiper and the church a man it's a choice it's a choice to worship it's a choice the praise it's a choice to come into the house of God it's a choice to read the word it's a choice to be on fire it's a choice to forgive and so choice the love it's a choice to have more patience it's a choice to Terry and waters of you horns are your top it's a choice to bridle your tongue it's a choice to have the right attitude it's a choice it's a choice it's a choice can the church say man hallelujah God's word has got to come to pass he promised a variety said it's gonna be a super Church it's gonna be super race that has got to come to pass every word has got to come to pass hallelujah I will respond say the Lord that word has got to come to pass that's your promise has nothing to do with what you're lost the question of what you're lost your question is when is he gonna restore because he promised restore hallelujah hallelujah my my my my mind I'm gonna brand him in the message putting on the whole armor of God he says that and he sees speaking about about secret agents and warfare and he said each nation will equip its people with the latest equipment the very latest and they study and they do everything they're trying to counteract the other fellows weapons I think a little more modern weapon something with a little more punch to it and it's the nation's business if they want to survive they want to equip their soldiers with the best equipment that there is well God you know he's infinite you don't have to think anything better hallelujah he doesn't think anything better he got the best to begin with so you can't improve on it nothing to be done about it he gives us the best that's his wood it's what is the best so good they're trying to give you our improvement on it it's the same wood it's already the best weapon it's your best offense against sickness it's your offense against everything you're going through your boys giving trouble to the wood the wood is flour you're feeling sick take the water by his stripes I'm healed you see the word come on now but Iran I've said God cannot make a decision today and tomorrow come back and make a better decision God doesn't make mistakes he doesn't have accidents here well let me try this this morning lemon let me try to talk about a pop well i'ma try to talk to about our Nicholas i'ma try and see if this hole up this time no he makes a perfect decision every time so if God chose you and put your name down on a lamb's book of life he got bigger I wonder if I do it I wanna do it right no he already chose you and God cannot change his mind he cannot change his mind about you Oh hallelujah and the arrow of God's deliverance has already been shot he can't even pull it back his prophesy over you I've already been spoken he can't even take it black hallelujah so you can rest on whatever God says you can rest on whatever God says concerning your life you can rest on what he says about your help you have to rest on what he says about your spiritual condition that he would not leave you Paran it's not his desire to leave you empty you can rest on what he says when he says he gonna give you the Holy Ghost you can rest on that you have to go beyond your emotions beyond your feelings I'll be on your mistakes The Devil's Shabbos I keep you in that realm of your mistakes and your sins and your failures and what went wrong and you lose control that's the devil's job but we are here this morning to get reminded that there's a seed in our soul that the devil cannot mess with the devil didn't put it there that ever kind of reach it he cannot get to it but a brother sent him to get access he and he have to come under the blood and he cannot come under the blood because in the devil with the common of the blood he'll be your brother but the devil is our enemy he cannot come under the blood so he cannot come and touch what's inside your soul he has no access he has no access when the never tries to reach you he try to reach you access denied he can reach other people for you you are the blood wash once there's power in the blood there's a blood bumper around you the devil could try to afflict your body he could try to mess with your spirit but your soul there's a see them they're a germ of predestination hallelujah you may be seated and that scene it's based on the law of God that seat could only produce after its kind and that seed in that seed has every genetic code from God in that sheet is a living feet it's a living virtue it's a living knowledge it's a living temperance is a living patience it's a living College in that sedum is the mechanics in that sheet is that DNA of who you are that you didn't know about so God had to send the message to wake up your understanding that this seed is in your soul and cut at a week of your understanding that you have to get that sheet in the right atmosphere because you could take a seed you may be seated and if you put the seed can ice it'll have a different result and if you wanted in good ground it's all about the environment so where the pranam said if you take a chicken egg and put the egg under a dog didn't see that because the atmosphere is right the chicken was still hot because it has to be near right environment and when you take a seat you can't put the seat in nice beautiful sprinkle sand and prints on ice dust no you have to put the seed in money on you have to put the seed in the field sometimes you have to put the seed in conditions that that that that seem contrary to the beauty that's about to be revealed so God under the chaos of darkness under the cares of this world allowed us to grow up in different homes different families different backgrounds that appear to be so messed up that the devil have to wonder could anything good come out of Nazareth the devil 801 could outbreak about a Trinidad the devil after one is here somebody's gonna overcome because they're looking bleak and looking like the bride instead it looked like nobody holding a message but the sheet is still alive and the devil because he can't see it because it was hidden under the Seventh Seal he is trying to do mathematics and geometry and algebra to figure out who you are the scenery here to access us if so be if thou be FOP if God poured himself into Christ and the devil didn't even know who he was what about you as an amateur cook what about you as a measure of that stature the devil has no idea who you are you are caught secret weapons his secret agents somebody say man blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so his word cannot return void but Abraham said this message would find itself in the hands of the predestinated you didn't find a message the message found you the message interrupted your life the message wanted you the message followed you the message conflicted you the message convinced you even when you back slip it troubled you you try to do different things and somehow you just didn't feel comfortable that's why I City young people all the time listen when you have one foot in church I want for all the church is the most miserable existence the most frustrated place to be is one foot in church and one foot in the world because if I go to a party and jump up because there's too much of God in you to be comfortable there so you jump in on one foot you can and then I'm gonna come to church it cut and sew all the way in before one foot the fighter I'm trying to be outside you upstairs on your foot outside but something has to take over is about surrender it's about to ring on the white flag and seeing Lord I surrender that's where the song comes from I surrender all I surrender control surrender decision-making surrender all of it to what God wants and when you do that it's simple this message is not complicated you know it's a message of surrender it's a message of commitment it's a message of truth and faith and a reality that your behavior has to change people come to church and going back and they have more knowledge but they were here via ISM more information but the behavior is the same if you disrespect with your husband I would expect at least every week you're less disrespectful until it's gone but are these same level a disrespect for years you were operated at level 9 let it hit eight seven six five four until it some people lose the behaviors immediately like like like Saul on the road to Damascus Gordon knock him off a horse immediate transformation but as some people is a process we would pray everybody the media but as naughty kids it's a process of character development a process but a random talk about preen and he said as the about to break true is when you're getting tired and he musky to us come do you prefer to go to that you can't just go trash - only you pray for two hours solid every day really it's a process and you have to carve out more time you have to and this is your work enough people waiting and go to give to give them to get to give you what you ready give you the word which is all your weapons we need and in the word gives instructions about having a prayer life even the word have instructions husband love your wives as a commandment in the world instruction children obey appearance in the world don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together so you're supposed to be the house of God in the word present your boys a living sacrifice holy and acceptable that's in the word walk before me beat up perfect neighbor that's in the world so your promise is there Jesus come back in Matthew 5:4 ear beat therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect that's your word that is your hope that's your expectation that's your reality but if you want anointing a word to yourself what are you doing it is making circles you and your own death walk walk around in circles commented church walking around in circles but when you see that who is would sign return void that word that is not returning void is not Jes blessings you know it's also judgements because when God pronounced judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah he couldn't even take it back judgment I've already been spoken so he had to extract lot o because when God speaks he can unwind his word he already spoke it so judgment is spoken over Los Angeles judgment is spoken over this island judgment is spoken over this it fires coming judgment is coming but I wrapped is also coming deliverance is also coming a way of escape has already been spoken and is I've God sent a prophet to make sure that that message of escape gets to us that we can get ready and make preparations the seaman Noah made preparations the same way all to the aegis he made preparations so to we come this morning to make preparations to be

and position the fish and when Jonah was a new on the ship and he fully forward to the fish that fish listen the fish taking instructions to take him straight away supposed to be straightway he's supposed to be hallelujah that's my brother branham said you'd love to get to desperate conditions will st. gonna have to break your foot to make sure you come in here in a way to come in with a

God he's all caught by himself Church he does one part of you he wants all of you I hope this help somebody this morning many times we we want to get caught up in so much second the simple things we leave God out of the picture he doesn't want part of you you know the problem is people put things in in in cabinets or containers so so Sunday morning is church as he scheduled for children and Monday's work and then Tuesday is this and and God air coming back in the conversation until he make service compartmentalize thank you but Anthony don't put God in a compartment but I Brandon preach doors and doors for a reason is if you would like to put gordon ET me porch in them and you go any bedroom you're going to leave the room and god have no invitation so the other parts of your life but when he pitched or don't you say make god feel welcome make jesus feel welcome make jesus welcome to go into your kitchen and open all the holy doors all the copper doors in the kitchen somebody preach back to me this morning what jesus be welcome to open every draw in your kitchen what jesus feel welcome to go through your bedroom and come on now what jesus be welcome to open your desk on your job what jesus will welcome to log onto your computer what jesus be welcome to go into you could you give Jesus the password to your food come on somebody preach back to me he wants all of you what jesus be welcome to to be on every conversation what would you see on the floor if Jesus is on the line if every phone call is a conference call Richie's on the other line what would you see to your brother what would you say to your sister what would you say to your neighbor if Jesus is in the conversation whatsapp when you speak to your family your friends what would you say if Jesus is underlined come on now somebody peach back to me me Jesus feel welcome in your car when you're driving down the road make him feel welcome to listen to what you listen to come on somebody preach back to me this morning this is the gospel it's not putting on a suit on Sunday morning is him need a welcome to go everywhere because the Bible said you went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs wonders and miracles but I Benjamin what Jesus be welcome would he be welcomed with a Jason what do you be welcome in your house because he had looks okay but would he be welcome because to make him feel welcome your behavior has to change your language has to change your conduct has to change [Music] can we dig into this a little bit if somebody respect come to your house I've seen people whisper any kitchen and if the person wasn't there it wasn't one spin antenna watch the two cups because he you reach enrich so you feel embarrassed when somebody comes I give your boss command for the house and be like no you know it was excused the place excuse me place I am I was really able to clean feet last nine months is too easy please Jesus not coming I got no excuse deep listen we talk about a change of behavior excuse a place and I start talking about wifey last it once we we really can't speak until I was like you sir we have talked make Jesus welcome because for Jesus to be welcomed because Jesus's love so the lava has to be there because that's what attracts him in on his attraction to us is because he so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son it was love was driving his behavior so to make Jesus be welcome there has to be love between husband and wife love between wife and husband love between father and son and anybody in the house is anybody in the house this morning for Jesus if you welcome the love must be reciprocated can I speak a little bit I remember a few years ago I was preaching about love and relationships and and I'm doing things and say listen a lot of young people think this messages rules and rules and rules and regulations by say this about love because if you love somebody you will do what makes them happy so I made the point that in my house my wife only white clothes here any color clothes but because she wanted white clothes here and if I put call that only white clothes will get in trouble I'm still a work in progress the points that colorblind but it shouldn't be fear of punishment that leads to be white on whites and colors and colors it should be love makes your behavior to adjust in such a way that would make her smile anybody everybody with me this morning and the converse has to also be true then it would be things that I I like my coffee a certain way you can feel and to make it a way but if you know how I wanna be coffee well George if you're making you wait and I will get a yes but I'm if that's in the natural how much one is spiritual because God I thought up we should say God bankrupted heaven it's greasy wood by giving everything he had his only begotten son his love was so great he gave everything all that God was he wanted to Christ and he sent His Christ tone as the greatest gift when he searched happened to figure out how they express his love the only way you can do it is his only begotten son his most valuable possession he gave it all to redeem man and we in turn want to give him a two hours on a Sunday is that what love means to you because God is love he may be seated that's why I don't take issues and by the niccola's helped me understand this sometimes in these simple things gives us the perspective sometimes I think about Nicholas also was talking and he was explaining he say people I say why us leave your house to go all you ate the ground you say well some time ago you know sorry either if it's him or somebody know he's he had a girlfriend in Tahoe or something and he said it was leaving he was Merivale to go up to Tahoe or whoever and I was traveling because he loved was great they're not no eztravel but his love was so great it was men back in the old days before he had what's up on this thing yesterday it's a plan D visit it's a plan D tribute to see if it yes I leave early any morning to make it on time what drove that behavior was love if it wasn't ready sure he was in love it wasn't intentional is this is this reaching anybody so if you tell me you love God and Jesus went deep I see how could you even love Gordeeva Kyle of it wasn't next year before God see me and you telling people you love me but you brought it next year you look at him heart is shaky honey I call them pretty weak finally will you love me let me take down this thing called love because we are one body so n1 memory buddy in pain you want to feel it and when one member is enjoy you ought to feel it too because it's one body is a body of Christ by one spirit you baptized into that one buddy so friends this is a encourage you this morning this is nothing my notes or somebody pulling and I'm healing to the pole this morning because this has to become a real trust what are you looking for preacher I looking for a reality that the behavior when people see you see me they must take note that something is different about us that we have been with Jesus because it was understood that when you met Jesus your life was not the same you can't tell people you met Jesus and you live in the same way you have yet to meet Jesus because when you meet him your behavior it's supposed to change your love it's supposed to change your worship is supposed to change your command man is supposed to change somebody please talk to me I always find myself in these messages where's Nani shout for joy and if they kind of coming to your house opening doors opening windows putting out on any bed it has something when they clean and they say I became by myself you can you're free that I people help you you don't know what you're gonna find but when you live in Iraq you like no go in that door don't know that that leave that window do it no not that room just clean this clean you know what just clean the porch Oh handle everything else and you know that we used on your life but I better call it on confessing Bobby said confess your force wants another get it out your system encourage one another provoke one another it's like that you know there's some people he did don't want to marry doctor could freely injection we didn't listen we deepen when help is when we come to church we come for the word begin to operate and uncover things that we may think it's okay that we may think I want you to get this done that you think it's okay but it's not that's why I drove it always see husband's love your wives not as your father loved your mother but as Christ loved the church because we measure things based on our experiences we measure things based on our knowledge we measure things based on our understanding but God has a way and our objective of coming to church as to see his way not my way nutty pastas way is way the way he operates because we want to be like him can the tread salmon and no wonder the Prophet does a full obedience to the entire Word of God it's what entitles you to the token because full of penis of the word will bring you into subjection to the would Wheaton for dynamics that come upon the mechanics but the mechanics part is your part the dynamics part is his part can the church say man anybody everybody's gonna find this morning could we could we go somewhere nice I see I see background i already i already i really attending afternoon looking for change of behavior and god will test us and they told us that devil will also test and make you prove every one of these virtues so you have tests comment from every side to prove these virtues are operating in you before he can seal the whole thing so it must be proven before the final ceiling before charity comes a bundler perfection to compete the whole thing I'd say this is a finished work can the church say man and in order for you to even be here this morning you have to be led by the spirit just like Simeon was led by this bird you shall not see death until you see the Lord's Christ semen was living comfortable because he knew that he couldn't die until you see the Lord's Christ Brian Anna without having eyes to see the natural was led by the spirit to identify Messiah wasn't it that's being led by the spirit but about having a message expectation the same reason that you're here tonight I said today you sick people the same Holy Ghost that let's see me on the same Holy Ghost and let Anna has let you here for you believer there's a fountain open somewhere for healing it's here God moving amongst his people and it's people believing so the Holy Spirit could only lead you to truth the Holy Spirit could only leave it's an act right yet come and tell me you spurned have your aching body you misbehave and say in a spirit so if you are if you have the Holy Ghost you looking for the Holy Ghost there's evidence of that you know your behavior supposed to be speaking to that you can't be losing your cool you breaking up your house your match something than see is what the Holy Spirit will not lead you sisters to cut you here try to put up makeup trying to look like the wall and could imagine if Jesus is welcome in your room and you there trying to pick up I'm put up something on your face to do it wouldn't you feel embarrassed because I see sometimes people who say they believe when they meet on your own and when they recognizes me over to move it over Anthony they comfortable look at you from the corner because they don't hear so if a man would make you feel that way how should go and make you for you as you go to every decision of your life your schoolwork your business life your career you can't operate like the word in the corporate world people wanna stab in the back and do this and do that it's not what God teaches we're dying holders work here you know so and you will risk your experience with God because any waiting world operates on your job or in school or whatever this one to break this possession of this compartmentalization of God to your church experience but as when you're alone and nobody else is around is your true test of who you are when your wife not tell your children that there nobody else is there who can hold you to a higher expectation then you real you stands up and that's what we have to tell us what the tutor that's when the whole is pretty tutor wants to see your behavior he really wants to see you behavior when nobody else is around to see how you will conduct yourself and this is what we are fighting for friends the church is a born-again bunch of believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost led by the Spirit of God that's sweeter than Jubilee they are not of the world they are out of the world they are different from the world I've preached this before it cannot be that you are like the world or you want to be like the world or you want to act like the world the Bible said if you love the world and the love of God is not even in you not even in you come to church say man that's what makes them what they are their life is dead and they're hidden Christ dead in Christ and hidden sealed by the Holy Ghost they're away from the things of the world from the message expectations sons of God are led by the Spirit of God not led by some other fanatics or some organization or something other they are led by the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit was given to the church to be the overseer the tutor that was to raise the children of God not our bishops and Cardinals and so forth but the Holy Ghost and by the brennaman said and this is his expectation he had a word for us I'm expecting the Holy Ghost not denomination not a bishop not a Catholic priest not a Baptist preacher or a Pentecostal preacher I'm expecting the Holy Ghost to come and set in order a church that will go to meet him filled with the power and the resurrection of Christ I'm expecting that I believe that God promised that that there'd be a church dear without spot or wrinkle on it I'm expecting it because God said it was so and my shall not return unto me void and the church Amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I remember preaching a message God has never changed his strategy hallelujah cuz he's a senior student today on forever I am girl and I changed not so the way he operates the operators same way every time and the devil still doesn't get it that even though gonna pray the same way every single time the devil still can't figure out how God operates hallelujah Roma's eat certain moreover whom he did predestinate Demi also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified because he predestinated you because he thought knew you he could predestinate you because he predestinated you he called you because he called you he justified you and listen these words are all past answer let me read again I want it is not future tense or presidency no more room moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called past tense and whom he called Demi also justified past tense and whom he justified them he also glorified past tense so God does not know predestinated no Collin no justifying not no he already did it so your destination of glory is guaranteed he is speaking as a finished work what demon what devil worked out what past what mystic can separate you from the love of God hallelujah nothing Pass nothing present nothing hallelujah everybody feeling fine Oh hallelujah in a message a guide and I love this quote because god unbearable said God has never changed his strategy never change it and Satan has never changes so this is a pallet confusing me but a George F Court hasn't changed on the G and by the varsity devil cartina strategy and God always winning and the devil have no room to change because that means God will win everything every single time so this is a rigged game and we know the result before he can play every day every day we know the outcome enough every single day we know the outcome every single day we know the outcome and what's the confirmation of it I want you to get this for a minute you may be seated I love somebody speaking recently about Jesus people know Jesus as the healer people Lord Jesus as he as Jesus who was asleep on the boat and that's wonderful but he see the resurrected Christ because within Judaism and the aslam atif other groups they recognize Jesus as prophet what they have problem with is you resurrected eyes because they have no problem with Jesus as prophet but they have a probably resurrected Christ because he resurrected Christ is the one that break them all of all the other prophets all Jude Jesus ministry it was calling him good master calling him teacher that's funny how does it address the others rabbi teacher master ela this donnelly Jews were would not knowledge about our miracles they knew miracles so Jesus did a miracle wasn't really a big big big thing in context because they knew they had miracles before but is he when Jesus died and he put your word before he died he said destroy this temple and she is already back up again them kind of things is what people have problem with dies eating the devil really our issue because when Jesus died Jesus the Bible said no sin but in all of him to get the pass the ticket to get to hell because I had to get a ticket to go to hell the card is going to hell you had to have sin to go to hell but Jesus inhabitation so he had to find him and Jesus taught there such a collection to get a ticket he took the sin from the class the same from the present listen from the future and he said taking all of it and I put in on this ship because I want nobody to question my ticket to get down into hell because what Jesus was going for was beyond just Redemption he was going for Authority and power because the Bible said all power in heaven and earth was given unto him but the devil was rolling some keys so when Jesus reached they couldn't stop him from walking inside because he was sinful but he was the only one who could walk in and walk back out for the first time someone could walk in and walk back out he walking and man handling security walking and manually bodyguards walk straight past the bodyguards straight to the temple and took the keys turn back around unluckier ham unlock Isaiah I'm not - well I'm not listen I want you to picture it and nobody could move because they never saw this before Jesus was doing what had never been done before all the demons in Hell want to know who is this who is this who is the king of glory the Lord mighty in battle he had come town can the church say man [Applause] maybe she did I had preached about this before God's Dominion is heaven he put man truly it man's dominion is the it that's why you have to pray because God don't operate without prayer God don't move without a request somebody have to cry and I have to cry the Turner's have to cry somebody a little it has to do something to activate cord to move on the scene it takes a human it takes a man a son in position to activate the glories activate the power cord doesn't get struck down unless somebody makes a request that's what he called to Moses he said I've heard the cries of my people and I've come down because man has dominion somebody preached back to me [Applause] you see the bear in mind that's fallen man magnesium is falling man that's money each one of the Holy Ghost that's money native living and soon that's man Anita before the fullest of the atonement and yet still deer cries interrupted heaven and cause go to drop down on the earth because somebody had activated his presence or somebody preached back to me so in order to fulfill the plan of redemption God had to find a body that's why he had to get Jesus he had to put a sperm inside of Mary and by the bottom said he picks it all together himself so he can have a buddy he could use so now this body could give it everything you don't need somebody else who don't understand your plan so Jesus can all see when you see me you see the father we think in the same way we are the same page we know I am here my always not yet come because Jesus on a mission to bring deliverance to set the captives free to comfort him that morn he was the prophet of prophets the teacher of teacher the master of master the King of Kings the Lord of lords wrapped up in human flesh and he was vulnerable he was tired he was weak he fell asleep and this great Court stood in front of Lazarus grave and wept and when he shook back his head he activated who was inside of him he said Lazarus come forth I'm gonna brand him said if he didn't see Lazarus every dead every dead person was gonna wake up everybody would be this morning so what are you afraid of this morning no wonder pork is here these workers said death where is your sting grave what a victory talk about because even if I die listen it's just me speedily gettin to bite you often in this this wretched man that I am this flesh man I am here on a mission they have no fear no fear George scripture you know what do you want the most common thing jesus said fear not fear not fear not and then in the New Testament literally say four corners have given us the spirit of but a spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father so what are you afraid of don't be afraid you're gonna make it don't be afraid you're gonna be healed don't be afraid whatever you do shall prosper don't be afraid keep walking on the promise don't be afraid of ten thousand and falling your eyesight or whatever I shall not be moved keep your eyes like flint I'm going to the rapture I'm going to the resurrection I want to have a revival my son is coming my daughter is coming my wife is gonna be delivered that's our promise hallelujah so God always needs somebody if God didn't need anybody could have operated without humans but he needs somebody so he called Paul a Pharisee of Pharisees nod man who was not there when Jesus was there and keep his mind a mission and when he was called and brothers have an issue with him God has two things go ahead I get that nice but who was there when he was a boy he picked Paul he picked Paul who brothers had issue with him even when positive priest reading by what anybody still a issue with Paul because they was thinking back when Paul was free to them and they remember the Steven and when Paul was there and Paul is Manson killerman when they say it so it might something bad but but God was showing that when he take a hold of somebody you can't judge that person by your human eyes poor was a tiny right hand of God a messenger time age and God Paul Iranians Martin Columbo loser Wesley and in our age he sent a prophet 20th century prophet simple man small minority education but God speaking first to that man and then through the man these son of man field and a son of man and everybody is speaking a spoken word the original seed words that cannot fall to the ground words that must come to pass words that somebody will catch word that somebody will hold on to words that will change your life words that would interrupt the plans of the devil would that would pronounce healing can the church seem whoa hallelujah oh I'm not gonna be too much longer with you Oh hallelujah God gave the promises and he is able to keep his promises and when God give the promise to Abraham in a message convinced and concerned he said he would possess the kids of his enemies and so shunga believed that he destroyer Sunderland and look at the odds against him court only needs one man just let him get one man in his hand the world will think he's crazy but he will drive home the gospel when he's thoroughly convinced that Jesus Christ remains the same yesterday today and forever aiyoo thoroughly convinced that he's a same yesterday today and forever because if you are thoroughly convinced that he's the same yesterday today and forever it'll make you live a certain way it'll make you act a certain way because you have thoroughly convinced that he's the same yesterday today and forever under anything else he will stand true and go on because he's thoroughly convinced that God is good and if he ever was caught he's to go that's where the man speaking if he isn't a God he was he never was God that's right he's he infinite God the all-powerful almighty omnipresent omniscient infinite oh my he's caught he's the same God at opana read see he's the same God that brought Daniel out of the lion's den the same God that brought the Hebrew children from the fiery furnace he's the same God that raised up Jesus Christ on Easter morning he's the same God that friendly at Pentecost he's the same God that raised Lazarus out the crib he's ashamed yesterday today and forever and I'm convinced that this is the Holy Ghost [Music] hallelujah my my my my he's the same yesterday he's the same today he's the same forever he's the same quarter when Joshua says sunshield and see the salvation of God and his son stand right there he's a shame gonna meet it come to pass he's a simcard that was there when you were born in the hospital room or in the house he was there to make sure your delivery was all right he's a simcard the place that he went to school he was there to make sure you went to school he was there when you got up this morning and started your car he was dead he's there all the time and he promised to never leave you he promised to never forsake you he promised to be with you Peter said in the day of Pentecost this is that and if this isn't that I'll keep this till that comes for I believe this is that I'm convinced that it's the gospel and the power and the demonstration of the resurrection of the appearing of the Lord Jesus in this last day making the church ready to be caught away in the pride see in a message future home of the heavenly bridegroom and his Hebrides see his plan of redemption is exactly the same by everything he uses the same method he never changes he said in Malachi 3 I am God and I changed not the way he does it therefore if he saved the first man he ever saved by the shed blood of an innocent one you have to save the next one and everyone he saves will have to be the same way if he healed a man at any time to the journey of life let it be the tears of Jesus the Apostles the prophets whenever it was when the same conditions is meant he's got to do it again that's right he doesn't change man changes time changes it changes dispensation changes but God remains the same he is perfect what our hope that ought to give the sick people if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the scene is met he ever say the man he's got to do it under cm grounds he did it the first time if he ever fell a man with the Holy Ghost he's got to do it in the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever raised a manner from the grave he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle he doesn't change oh what a hope that gives me what is it nothing some man-made theory something that groups of men have come together but his unchangeable would let every man's will be a lie and mind be true for heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never feel all Scripture is given my inspiration therefore is good and profitable for doctrine all scripture will be fulfilled every bit of it that's what the Prophet said can the church say Amen everybody feeling fine just a little more we're done God's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them just a little bit and we'll go as a prophet saying like a Pentecost what did he do it taken them 10d is to get all emptied up but it was all standing there where their vessels turned up and God took himself and filled them up that's all they shook the wood poured himself into them the same Holy Spirit that see the Lutheran's that sanctify the Methodists that baptize the Pentecostals is now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get the people back and one is here we are in the end time come from the east or west north south what are we doing getting ready for that rapture getting ready holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost is that your prayer this morning that every fiber is filled with the holiness is that your expectation and every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost it's all over you at all in you it's all around you it's you are so M Dida but he could fill every part of you with his present with his love with his glory that's my expedition that's my prayer that's my desires and your desire this morning can the church say Amen glory hallelujah hallelujah in a message of paradox just to bring this home my word shall not retail void he said in every age there have been some of it left off so he's saying the reformer didn't have time to take care of it in the days of luta he only preached Jessie because of my feet and he was gone they made a church after that come Wesley he presented occasion there was an Along Came the Pentecostals but we are promised according to revelation 10 a quantumatic eye falls in Luke 22 17 and so forth that has got to come any visions of this there's promise of friends that must come in Ephesians that these Sevenfold mysteries of the Word of God must be unfolded and it's in the Laodicean age that this takes place and I believe that we are here we are here at another Ephesians we are here at another dispensation we are here at another time when the closing and the finishing of everything is at hand what's going on the world the political arena Wars rumors of wars earthquakes technology all these things economic powers all the beasts powers a system I'm pleased and the bride is getting ready not the church now not the church the bride is getting ready to go to church has tribulation coming but the bride is desperately getting ready because the world is getting it the military preparation economic preparation and only the bride is getting ready to leave here because we are promised that the bride is rapture the rest of the church's remnant tribulation what group do you belong to this money are you making preparation we got a battery that his wife hacked meet us already so only wise making ready at home church members go to church but White's getting ready wife is asking what do I need to do to get ready what I knew

yeah I'm leaving on your mind go we're gonna leave it on your mind it puts things into perspective we're never leaving on your mind I push it chop into perspective when I'm leaving on your mind it puts your family into perspective we're not leaving on your mind you operate a certain way because you don't know what T the flight will call when the raft Express will call so you have to have the ticket in your pocket you can't forget the ticket or maybe you don't know where they gonna get called you have to have it all the time the token must be displayed you've got to have it so when the call comes you can set ready the doctor woman gets to go home and pray we learn a parable of the virgins ten virgins ten in the message ten come at the church ten here and the preacher my five wise and five foolish and they practice here coming back i coming back and well the bridegroom was not there some slumbered some slept and the five wise they made sure that they were ready Lambs ready trim already ready they are not taking chances they learned too much preaching to take a chance then the cry went to be all the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him the file of all wise they were already one time I'm ready the foolish didn't know they're supposed to get ready and then they say well here's what we drove another light we'd have enough oil we don't know we drove enough what it takes to make it out to meet the bridegroom can we get some and the wise saying listen if we give you from our oil if we have enough for you and for us go to them that sell and buy but it was too late it was too late it was too late friends to him to get ready it's time to get ready it's time to get ready are you ready it's time to get ready because his wood cannot feel he doesn't change his strategy he will not get you ready you have to get these already his wife has made herself ready the word is there the instructions he had a plan for the dress the plan for how to operate how to live how to act his nature is being his actually which is all in the word how it was operate in the days of Esther when Esther they were being when I'd been chosen and had been been prepared to go to the king there all are you not send me preparing them to go and meet the king the eunuchs had no see the unit's were just there to prepare him because they knew what the Kings desire was so their message and their ministry was just to get to get the potentials ready for the king to choose and you read it they could have taken whatever adornments they want and I still didn't choose none of the jewelry none of the makeup none of the fancies you say whatever the King would wonder whatever you recommend but I'm gonna wear this other stuff and when the King saw us we chose it wasn't coming from the king and you meet the one already this this guy work no you have to be ready when you come to church you're coming to church you're come ready to worship ready to receive the word ready for the one to have an effect in your life willing you had open your eyes not closed you're not complete your own bias your expectation your own way of how it's supposed to be no you come to hear the word for the word to have an effect in your life so you could be a better Christian a better son a better daughter you can be more prepared every week you're supposed to be more ready so the day you supposed to be more ready than last week and next week more ready than this week but you can't go backwards may you can really lock your position I'm not going backward this is not the time to backslide not the time to give up because his Woollett kind of returns void and his wood is hanging over families his word is hanging over churches his word already said go to the city and put the mark upon those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city that word has already gone forth and it was said begin that my sanctuary any ancient man that would is already going out and his work country to the void but to them that sigh and cry to tell them that seek his face his wood is also true to them he will visit them for them that I'm looking for the Holy Ghost he will visit them but then they are hungering and thirsting after righteousness he will visit them because first minions are hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled that word cannot return void it must accomplish the purpose hallelujah hallelujah the musician to get ready I'm almost done hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh blessed be Adam had lost a book it was a book of authority it was a book of flower it was a book of names Adam was supposed to open the book and speak from the book and when he called names they ought to be created but Adam lost it when he fell and Satan tried to grab it but his book was to slip through his hands only certain hands could handle the book or he sitting eyes could see the book so the book went back into the hands of the original owner and we needed a redeemer to come and be a kinsman redeemer to fully open back access to this book so John had wept when he was caught up and I mentioned because there was nobody worried to loose the seals and to open this book no wonder John shouted when they said Behold a little tribe of Judah and the lamb started to come out and all the whole thing unfolded because John knew without redemption there was no possibility and all of this that God didn't manifest through his prophets was to bring the word for us that we could have comfort in this day that we could make it whenever Adam said in Israel and the truth I believe in the truth in his Road tonight a power of the Living God and mid will speak the wood here and they are little flash like lightning and the church is coming out not a psychologist not some of this put on make-believe but a real true genuine anointed holy Eagles called out Church that's what I'm looking for can the church say man is that right wait and God trying to please his
