in us something has to happen to show what's in us if you're studying what the devil telling you you would feel like a nobody forever your Fenian wooded forever maybe that's how David might have felt because his brothers of course they had this using a family and his brothers had issues where David was concerned so when David came on a message from his dad to drop some meal from his brothers the attitude was what you doing here who home with the Sheep if David was concerned about what was told him by his brothers he could have just taken a boat in dropped the meal and go back home but Goliath spoke and when Goliath spoke David heard David heard board set it up that way for David to hear when goal I had spoke because God was speaking for 40 days and 40 nights and nobody was interested or given a response to Galia by text by fax by any means whatever by smoke nobody was talking back to Goliath but David heard and they every responder who is that uncircumcised philistine he don't belong here he's done one of us he's not part of the Covenant he's not part of the agreement but God he's not a citizen of this country he's an immigrant he's an outsider people belong for the covenant of Israel there's no healing for him there's no breakthrough for him there's no deliverance room on the contrary course they run demo drive them out kick them out put them out don't live with them you

believe that this morning doesn't matter what the challenge is a struggle is the fear is the problem is he is still a miracle working God I want to greet the church this morning on behalf of my wife and I is a great honor to be here when a salute but Anthony for the message last week your picture with Anthony amen and the messages but over preached three weeks in a row and Ephesians what a time what a time what a time so I wanna encourage you this morning but a message and I pray it will be a blessing to you so I had to get straight to the word this morning if you have your Bibles will you turn with me to one passage of Scripture we're gonna go to the book of Hebrews we're gonna read Hebrews 11 in its entirety Hebrews 11 I'm gonna read from 4 verse 1 Hebrews 11 and verse 1 and before we go any further can we just bow our heads in a word of Prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence for your love for your mercy today and Lord for the grace that you have given us to be gathered here in your house Lord to be chosen in such a time as this Lord your word teaches that no man could come unless the father draws and Lord is a pull that has brought us here this morning from the east from the west from the north from the South law and and the devil doesn't like it and as a songwriter says Satan is man but I'm so glad that you chose us for such a time as this now as we learn and ever to read your word may you walk out the pages of the Bible may you lift the weary bodies may you take away depression and frustration and Lord may such a shout of the King be in the camp this morning father we take every spirit under our control in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ and Lord we pray that you deliver your people Lord you set the captives free Lord break the chains and the shackles love me you heal the sick in our midst Lord me you restore it there's a backslider who happened to walk in here this morning media realize it's not by chance it's not by accident but they came to the right place at the right time Lord you know every situation you know every need every condition love me you move through the house this morning and minister to your people Lord me you take my thoughts out of the way may you take this message out of the way and may you minister to the heirs of salvation this morning Lord that they could know that there is blood for them this morning and the Holy Ghost says for them that deliverance is for them love me you anoint the reading of the word and Lord God the hearing of the word in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen Hebrews 11 and reading from verse 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand it's only through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that the things which are seen were not mean of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by 80 being dead yet speaketh by Fiat Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without fear it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him my feet Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by feet by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is God through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprung their even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sandwiches by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off but were persuaded of them and embraced them and fest that there were strangers and pilgrims on the it but that says such things declare plainly that they seek a country and I ask the question this morning are you seeking a country and truly if they had been mindful listen of that country from Wednesday came out they might have had opportunity to have returned let me say that again and truly if they have been mindful of that country from Wednesday came out they might have had opportunity to have returned in other words if they were thinking about the country from where they came from they might have been inclined to go back but their thoughts were not there but now in verse 16 they desire a better country that is a heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten Son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of Joseph and worship leaning upon the top of his staff by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the cheran of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the Kings commandment are you with me this morning my feet Moses when he was come to years when he was old enough he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to do what suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season is anybody with me this morning and scheming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the King for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood less he that destroy the firstborn should touch them by faith he passed through the Red Sea as child on which the Egyptians are said to do but were drowned by fear the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days my feet the harlot Rahab perish not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace but what shall I say more for the time would feel me in other words the right to hear Paul is saying I can keep going on and on and on and on talking about the sinkhole feat for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barack and of samson and of jeff ty of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection are you with me this morning and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings here moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that without us should not be made perfect made a lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning [Music] hallelujah somebody say man we did some scripture reading this morning for those of you who didn't get time to read this week and there's no excuse for that because you're supposed to read every single day so that reading is only today's reading if that's how you're supposed to read the Bible every single day because that's what you grow and get strength and get more strength and you have to want to be in the spirit of the law to get something from the Lord can a church say Amen and right now for those of you who don't know I'm gonna bless you on the Internet this country's on the verge of Elections everybody's in the spirit of elections well at least most people if you're not in the spirt you don't really have a choice because the buses are passing and the trucks are passing and this traffic in the road and people are in the spirit it is a colored as a noise this there's the radio there's everything talking about this election and and people are so caught up in it people taking time off people up late at night walking the streets because they're in the spirit of something that's all natural that's all gonna fall down because no matter what government goes into power they all gonna crumble because everything that can be shaken will be shaken but like Abraham this morning by faith we are seeking a kingdom a city whose builder and maker is God I don't want to know about no natural Prime Minister I don't want to know about the natural government I wanna go for heavenly governments and the church mmm so I'm here to declare who I'm voting for this for them I don't want to know who you're voting for I can only give my testimony I can only give my revelation I could only speak my inspiration but I'm voting for the King of Kings I'm for the Lord of lords oh you don't hear me to smile and I want Jesus to be my Prime Minister I want Jesus to be my president there's no recession in his kingdom he has never made a promise that he can't keep he has never seen a one of his righteous forsaken and his sheep egg bread and the church ham it is small and there's no crime in his kingdom I want Jesus to be my minister of health because he's a God I could heal I want Jesus to be my minister of transportation because there's no place he can't carry me you don't hear me to smell them who you voting for I don't want to know but I'm telling you who I'm voting for this morning I want Jesus to be my minister of national security because where he is no weapon formed against me can prosper you don't get me too small hallelujah this is the best speech that has taken place since they started campaigning I'm campaigning for the King of Kings I'm campaigning put a lot of laws he has never failed he has always won every battle he has delivered every son and he still is able to give the Holy Ghost he is still here order to raise you up hallelujah you may be seated find me a prime minister who could fix your marriage I can't find one but if you vote for Jesus he can fix your marriage find me a prime minister who could get your children from out of the paw at all to the me skirts and in the world I can't find one but if you get Jesus and you elect him to be first place in your life of the first place in your house up first place in your company [Applause] can the Chertsey man you ought to be so happy to smell them I'm not here to preach to you just coming to church if you came to church yes to be in church I invite you to leave now that's alright I'm not here to entertain you I'm here because we are in a pattern we are in a war here and we are fighting because we allow all these distractions you maybe see there to get us all chillin upside down [Applause] [Music] keep alive energy for all kinds of stuff but the stuff that's really important we put it on the side of the show we put it on the shelves somewhere there is no excuse this morning that's why I realize the wrapped is just for a few people I'm looking at people that spawn and only some will be in the rapture somebody got upset with me the last time I said it but it's still the truth because God is not taking everybody who comes to church and put them in the rapture the rapture is for those who fight for every inch of ground and you have a choice this morning to be a church member or to be in their pride but God as my witness I want to be in the pride is there anybody this morning who wants to be in their pride you don't want to be a church member but you want to be a real Christian [Applause] come the message while it's a pet's name you may be seated but the Bantam said we know who's going to be king doesn't matter who's going to be President doesn't matter who's gonna be Prime Minister but we know who's gonna be king I know who is gonna be king he'll be king and I know it takes something this time but God helped me to shut my eyes to the nominations and everything else and look to that spiritual sight you'll know that he's coming the king he said I'll serve him if it's death let me die if it's my family if it's my loved one if it's my denomination it's everything let me serve him I'll steer to him that's what the warriors of God like was with even had their hands on their swords walking all the time that's the way cause warriors walk the enemy say you have to take a little drink to be sociable I don't touch that unclean thing you draw your sword why your warrior do we have any warriors in the house is small him do we have any fighters in the morning [Applause] listen friends if you didn't come to fight you're wasting your time and if you came with somebody to do something for you you're wasting your time because the land is already your land it's already been given to you it's already given to you God has already given you the land now it's up to us to fight can the church see man when [Applause] the enemy say there's no such thing as divine healing you know better that's a prophet there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost them days has passed you know better hallelujah it's too late able to tell me anything negative I know who my father is I know where I come from I know I am going and the church team so for my title this morning mighty Gentile warriors that's my title this morning mighty Gentile warriors my subject enough is enough I don't think you heard me enough is enough there has to come a point in your life where you draw the line and say this is it enough is enough I'm not taking it no more I'm not backsliding no more another letting the devil come into my house no more I'm not gonna let the never run through my life no more I'm not gonna let the enemy take what he wants from me anymore enough is enough is enough it's enough it's enough can the church help me this morning and my inspiration the sword of the Lord and his bride the sword of the Lord and his bride are we gonna get it in a minute can it's a man now with a brand I'm talking about David's warriors in the message why little Bethlehem he said they knew the unknowing thing was on that little all ruddy looking fellow and they knew he was going to be king but even in his own mind was frustrated his own City Bethlehem he looked at when a great thing that taken place but he was not in Bethlehem can the church say man he knew that in Bethany and there was something special in Bethlehem and David and all this frustration walking back and forth thinking oh this D is so hot I've been fighting for a long time this day is so hot I wish I just wish if you had a drink of water but not any kind of water he wanted a drink of water from the well down in Bethlehem can the church see man listen soul might have come this way the Philistines might have come this way Army's around everywhere and here he was sitting on the Mount of a cave this is where the random oh can it be how can it be who I wish I had a drink but the madam said his mind goes way back down there by the kids of Bethlehem there was a well he said there just was no water like that water and if you ever taste this everlasting water there is no water like that water given was thirsty and he just wanted it he only can get a drink of the water from that well he may be see this but Abraham said you know Palestine has some bad water they have evil waters they even have Blackwater fever and stuff a lot of it is alkaline water which will kill you what Bethlehem is the water seat of the prophets there is no water like Bethlehem had David used to think when I take my sheep and start out in the morning and go by that all well and drink oh how cool and how sweet and how it cuenta de cuenta this and how his throat is going and yet anointed he said oh if I only had a drink of water now his warriors he screamed out in his despair oh if somebody would bring me a drink again from that all well he didn't tell nobody to do it he does that always somebody could just bring me a drink of water from that well you know at Bethlehem after dreaming all of the victories if somebody could bring me a drink now his warriors could not interpret his thinking but brother he loved him with all that was in them and when David said that but the random said the least of his desires was a command to them so tree of his mighty warriors pull their swords and they slipped away from the camp do you didn't even know where he went he slipped away from the camp and they caught the away trooper the rounds had 25 miles of enemy territory because their captain King he wanted a drink of water and they cut through all kind of demons all kind of enemy therefore to this battle and this struggle and you just wanna you fought to be here this morning you could have been everywhere some people gave up he could even make it a smaller but you are here by the grace of God 10 the church seamen but abandom said David no doubt he was wondering where they're at what have they done where did they go to it don't they know they're jeopardizing their life they're right in the jaws of death true or 25-mile I'm laying in ambush everywhere but they believe that the King wanted a drink and but the balance said in a message we have seen his turn I've come to worship he said yes warriors today Jesus wants a good old Pentecost of fresh water these denominational stagnated waters is sickening to him he said take the Word of God and pull it and cut through all these trees and things up till we can hit that place where there's a fresh drink for him a real true worship a genuine heart where he can pour down his word he said you will restore the faith of the people back to the father's that's what I'm talking about this one it kind of church him [Applause] but a brand a master question he said I wonder if the Warriors to the mi speaking the Warriors this morning am i speaking the soleus this morning we're not speaking a little children this morning speaking the soleus from the time you are born it's a battle from my time you a pawn it's a struggle there's something built in you to fight and you'll fight them for something you're fighting to go to heaven or you're fighting to go to hell but abandom taught us he said and God doesn't send anyone to hell he said you fight to go to hell because God puts all the stop signs in front of you but you cut through that to get to help and if you want to go to heaven you gotta fight your way to go to heaven because the devil is against you but you are born warriors there's a fight inside of you you might get chopped you might get bruiser you might get wounded but it's a fight inside of you can it church teaming you may be seated but the Branum give the story one time huh I believe Julius Caesar was riding into triumph into Rome and he wanted to put one of his best men next to him and all the generals and everybody else was thinking that they were gonna be the one to ride with him into victory and Wow Caesar was getting ready he saw a little stable boy but all kind of cuts all over him he said where you been boy he said I've been fighting for my lord out in the path of these he said you were a ride with me those guys ain't got no cuts they got no bruises they got no scars blood so this morning if you got cuts and scars and bruises you wanna ride with a lord you might win every battle but we're gonna win the war you might have your ups and downs of popular to win the war we are warriors of the feet just like Gideon just like Samson just like Jeff time we are born to fight [Applause] you may be seated why the TV's men go to battle diva didn't order them to go to fight but his least desire he took it as a commander how do you get that this morning there's a lot of stuff that David could have said do this to this he was in charge but this wasn't a command he gave them his least desire it was a desire and it took his desire as a commander that had to be done that had to be accomplished we have many instructions in the Bible we have many commands in the Bible we call a command a commandment and jesus said if you love me then keep my Commandments but this is different this is not talking about God seeing do this and do this and come this is not that this is his least desire my desire is to and you take the desire and you run with it nobody can tell you come to church pay your tithe stand up those are Commandments but his least desire in the morning and nobody else is there he desires fellowship with you but you take it as a commander you can't move unless you pray you can't move because his least desire [Music] it's like a man his desire is least least desire smallest desire is a command to your Murtagh mother the big Commandments turn with the simple things the little things that God expects the little thing that God wants to see I said I have desires who have plans parents do to prosper plans of peace that that's his desire that's not a command but his least desire that's when you really be coming into warrior material when the least desire God is a command to you you say yes and you respond on a report for duty can the church see men oh [Music] brother brother branham's and I wonder question if the Warriors today those in the message today are willing to cut their way through formalism what's formalism formalism is the routine it's when it's become normal that at a certain time you get up understand me to get ready for church because it's a formality to be in church it's done the fulfilling of a desire it's a ritual like any other religion God has no respect for that because it's just like everybody else but God is looking for warriors who want to cut through the formality you're not here on Sunday because it's an expectation that you're here you're not here on Sunday because you're supposed to be here but you are here because his least desire is your command and he desires to commune with you this morning not your neighbor not your friend maybe not even your wife or your husband but you as a individual if your wife don't want it that's her problem if your husband was that's his problem you're sure I wanted that's their problem but for you his least desire is your command so he desires your worship it should be your command to worship never should have minutes after say lift your hands to worship never should've minutes after see stand to your feet because you know his desire is to see us a penance desire is to see you on fire his desire is to see you at the Holy Ghost but Abraham said God wants you to receive the Holy Ghost more than you want to receive it his least desire it's not my commander Lord I want the Holy Ghost the streamer you want to give it to me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and when you break into his least desire as your commander then your desires have to take second place because it means whatever the king wants you are ready to do whatever the King needs you want to put him please whatever the king and when the King does this you want to be the one to put the cup in his hand because the least of these desires is your commander somebody same oh brother I wonder if the Warriors today I willing to cut their way through formalism you know how many people think that believing on Jesus and they're gonna go to heaven accordingly church and the Pentecostal oh and they have no clue that there's a hell door that road to hell is paved with great intentions if in church every Sunday me so go to hell I was sharing with some young people a couple weeks ago that give some callings out without repentance as the Bible so you see a gifted singer gospel singer gifted preacher speaking and the gift is from God it's not their gift it's a gift from God but that gift comes without repentance that's why brother Branham said God don't make half we're preachers but a preacher could be halfway Gordo Nick half with Christians but a Christian could be halfway [Applause] can the church say man [Applause] the least of your desires he said there's a better manner if it's Africa in the episode of Street wherever it is the least of your desires Lord is my command death don't mean a thing to me popularity my what I am what I will be means nothing Lord is to fulfill your desires that's the Warriors but the Branham said that's standing by the side of him if they call me a Holy Roller if my name is scandalized if they kick me in the street that doesn't matter your desire is my command that's the real soldier from the message as a man hit a cat or on the light but Abraham said so is it today the least of Jesus is sports or how about his word should be a command to reach and how to love him for we know he's coming into power no matter how much he's rejected heavens and earth will pass away but this will still rain just the same when all of us at it is gone and we know he's coming into power because nothing will keep it from happening and by the Branham pacts is viable this is Christ a revelation of him and this is going to happen just the way the word says it is because he is the word and the least of his commands there no matter how little it is whatever it is we'll do it anyhow it's his command and brother Branham said the least of David's thoughts was a command to those Gentiles for their type of the Gentile church today gallant men see those men who stood by dealing with Gentiles but gallant men do of the illness they didn't even know what fear was you read you too scripted over the time jesus said fear not fear not fear not the Bible says for he hasn't given us a spirit of fear Christians are free to pray I told young people young people are free to pray for their food in the lunch rooms and their jobs I'm free to have a testimony Young's is the free to dress modestly why you afraid to dress as a Christian men are free to take a stand for the kingdom afraid to say no when you are fighting for a kingdom that is the only Kingdom all else is false can the church say man [Applause] but the banner goes on what did they do talking about those warriors before they were true until they cut it and well they dip the pocket of water out and here they come back fighting cutting their way from right to left so therefore to reach to the well I know that to fight their way back to David and they coming to the president even say here you are my lord oh my oh my what a testimony and what did David do David to say Lord be it far from me that I drink this these Warriors jeopardize their life to go yonder and bring this water to me he said it's too much blood I can't do this and he he took that water and he poured it as a drink offering as a sacrifice to God but if Adam said if that wasn't mean it was only fulfilling the Scriptures because although Jesus from Bethlehem is the bread of life he is also the water of life and what did he do he was represented in both David and the Warriors because he was the king and he was the warrior he came and broke through the enemy lines and I believe this today we wanna break through some enemy lines break through some lines and I've had you trapped for a long time we're gonna break through those lines I've just come with the church and having church spirit and just being our wayward member or just being in the messy we are cutting through some lines today conquered death hell and the grave poured out his blood that John 3:16 might be fulfilled can the church same so what are we on the expectation for church from mighty Gentile warriors to take their position to draw their swords and fight because enough is enough the enemy has had his time for a long time and I just gonna touch and that's why I read the Scripture in Hebrews because they were speaking of all the dut the judges and the heroes of feet and the warriors of faith who had to fight for every inch of ground it was never easy for anybody so don't think it's gonna be easy for you or easy it's never easy because it's a war it's a battle and wherever there's a battle that's way there's either a victory or there's a loss but out of this battle we are gonna have the victory can the church say man and all to the blabber you look at the book of Judges and stuff there was overcharged by the name of Shambhala anybody ever heard of Shama Shama I was just here minding his own business he wasn't even a soldier but when you read about Shama the Philistines will come and take away the crop whenever they put the crop in the barn the filicide will come and take the crop and just take it away and time after time he would do it and it takes a special something to go and keep working when you work hard and they're putting on the enemy take it but I'm gonna knew he had his family to feed yeah people depending on him he could just set him on say the enemy gonna take it so he kept on planting and reaping and the enemy kept on coming until chakra is your party say you know what enough is enough I'm not gonna allow the Philistines to come here anymore I'm not gonna depend on anybody else but this is my house I'm fighting for I'm not even calling for backup today is the wrong day for the Philistines I don't care there's one it was a hundred it was 630 today enough is enough and some God he didn't ever sword he didn't ever she'll get a spear I was a farmer you don't hear me to spear every sinner Samuel wasn't doing pull-ups Samuel was doing push-ups Santa wasn't matching left right left right sham de just had enough and sometimes at all it takes for you to reach the spot but you see I've had enough I don't care how much the enemy treats I don't care how many so let's and said enough is enough and the Bible says hunger you took an ox gold I know the young people they don't know what the Oxford is some you don't even know what the ourselves but when you want to move the Ox this little piece of wood almost like a key--and almost like a crop stick when he shall have a Prussian Cutlass no piece of wood to ends like this anyway use it a push to push the Ox up a little bit this is not a weapon just move a little bit you said a portion of coccyx move come on move on so I'm gonna look around Emma this was the wrong time to Philistine shoes to come by sanghas house scum but in final hole a pickaxe that's a sword a gun agree near somewhere grab the same Gorda yet been using his whole life it has pushed the oxen and as the Philistines came one by one one by one one by one oh you know hear me this morning I don't care what you have I don't know what you use them you have no excuse the problem is some of you do satisfy with the devil taking stuff from you but this morning I say enough is enough don't touch my prayer life don't touch me this morning not this morning not this morning oh [Applause] you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah the devil should have taken me out when he had the chance but I got my hand on my ox go this morning you should have done it last year when I didn't think about the Ox code but this morning but it's so I got the up school in my hand don't mess with me this morning because I'm gonna defend my house as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I'm tired of working and the enemy taking it away but this time I'm gonna claim my prayer life I'm gonna claim the holy dosa [Applause] come on you Gentile warriors pull your swords out pull your up school's out pull your pencils out pull something out but don't come here with just your hand alone put a piece of paper out because when he anointed comes a cup [Applause] enough is enough enough is enough how long you could be up and down come by the church you do know where you're standing this week you feel like praying next we could ever take your prayer your break on your bread corn on Summerhill you Capri for the whole week because the Phyllis I took your prayer life [Applause] one weekend on fire next week your honeymoon for the old service who is that the Philistines then come and take your praise away how long how long will you take before you reach the point will say enough is enough some of you got Phyllis ain't sitting on your hand right now you handle even want to get up your hands struggling to get up your hands fighting to get up but I believe there's some up schools in the house that you can just pick up that's it this hand this morning I haven't stood up in a long time I will worship in a long time my feet had some Phyllis hands on it but enough is enough mighty gentle warriors are getting ready we are campaigning as mighty gentle warriors because the king of kings and the Lord of lords he is mighty in battle [Applause] hallelujah oh I don't heal this morning I don't hear you this morning listen you may be seated you ever see somebody about to fight [Music] you may be seated when I was younger I tried to learn martial arts I wasn't too good at it but the instructor said you know what when you do this make a sound I was like why you gotta make yourself he said the reason you make a sound is it intimidate the enemy if you never see that before you get skill intimidate the enemy you see when you reach the point where enough is enough you will do anything I don't believe when Shamgar saw these men come at that time he's literally watching him quiet you know I believe Sharma Saturday make some noise because he was tired of the entire of losing the battle [Applause] and then there was one statement I believe Shama in his hat was saying was enough is enough listen goes for the signs you may be seated have to have rare belly even attacks hunger it might have been 600 of them you may be seated [Applause] left my notes already but it balance it all it takes is one you know all it takes is one it is one person who just get fed up as you say back you're just tired of just coming to church I'm going home with no blessing you that's tired you come to take your blessing you may be seated it just seems what I'm looking for one person this morning David had three men who ate and run I know I'm one I looking for two more to go at me to go bring back the drink of water because his knees desire is my command who will call into battle at meters you decent you may be seen it you see it just takes one there's a story of course it's not true but it's a feeble or a story I guess of some nice home mouse or whatever who were under threat from a cat and somebody came up with a brilliant idea why don't we hang a bell around the neck of the cat so that whenever he comes around we'll hear the bell ring and I will know we can go and hide somebody said that's brilliant and then the next question came up who will go and hang the bell on the cat [Applause] another analogy to see if there's one man in here with a gun one man just one man and the whole crowd is there there are enough people in here to overpowered and one man but he said none who is the one to go and fight this man with the one gun because the probability of you getting killed is very high so the point is don't try to corner somebody who reads a point of frustration and frustration could be negative or frustration can be positive a lot of people say I frustrated with my job I facili with my wife or shitty with my car but nobody was having an for city with the devil somebody was frustrated with the devil is a dangerous person because you are like the cat and those Phyllis's like the mice and they don't know who will put the bail on the cat and the moment you come out it glad to go running because you are coming down with a attitude you are coming out to conquer you are coming out for victory and I'm looking for some people you don't care what your family says about you you look at what your co-workers set up out you think you know what anybody says about you you want the promise of God for your life Brenda no friend family no family what are the hotels Oman it lucky middle holding also give me that give me my promise or give me that give me your top solo give me that give me skin science team oneness seven living voices me flips you knowledge is there anybody in the house this morning [Applause] mighty warriors you may be seated and I'm highlighting these elements deliberately for a reason the men who were with David were Radical men they were just covering my different clothes there were some stories and judges one man killed another man one man took a whole animal and open it into the kind of men David had were real serious recorded serious characters real real real serious men but some guys a different scenario some guys know Saudia but the need was great the situation was grave and most importantly he had just had enough he just reached his limit and you have to reach your spiritual limit of being up down your limit of depending on men and women to support you spiritually your limit of your prayer life being variable God is the giver permanence where whenever your cup run it just run over you have to be looking in a cup I wonder if I have anything no your cup running over that's that's his nice desire is your commander can the church see man [Applause] I pray this morning that in some way this will be an encouragement to you because many of us have the misguided mentality of depending on people to fix our problems to solve our situations recently I heard a professional make the statement he said don't get upset with me with my success because I have the same 24 hours you have and if you choose to spend 10 hours watching TV 6 hours on Facebook and I choose to spend my time studying reading praying then don't get upset with me because we got the same 24 hours is how you use it so when people tell me they have no prayer life you don't want to come to church they got something my brother you are making an active choice to do stuff to slow down your spiritual progress it's time you say enough is enough there's no excuse for you not being in church no excuse I [Music] wanna read how about Eminem said this so you could just appreciate it and Justin either down he told much younger I know the first thing you know coming on the road here was stumping looked out what was coming to pass they come up 600 I'm at Philistines coming up to take his whole summer store we take his food for the winter he knew his wife would be stabbed out through the winter his chillin might die they were dying from malnutrition and he knowed Debby something happened he was concerned about his family notice one thing has got to be done to take care of this situation he studied at me see wait a minute I'm not a solid this is very random I know nothing but to use a sword or anything and then 600 against me how would I ever do it I'm standing here with a pair of farmers clothes or more like overalls and they all well trained warriors great big helmets on and breast split some things tree like one big army he steady he was concerned about his family but after a while he become convinced that he had a right he was a Jew he was circumcised he was in the covenant with God through the promise that he gave Abraham and he had a right that God would protect him from his enemies and the spirit come upon him he grabbed an ox Corder that's a little thing they punch the Ox wit he took that up school and jumped out the door and slew six hundred Philistines but the parent said oh if this group of people here tonight will get that much convinced what would this church - if this group of people here tonight will get that much convinced [Music] [Applause] come a message convinced I can see him Adam Adam said God only needs one man just I didn't get one man in his hand the world will think he's crazy but he will drive home the gospel when he's thoroughly convinced that Jesus Christ remains the same yesterday too deep and forever can the church say Amen somebody worship somebody worship Him this morning [Applause] but the banner dramatizes he said what if shunga had said no wait a minute I've got to wait til I see them coming and I better go away to school a little while and learn how to make a denominational Creed deal with them he said if he had done that that's all you would have known so he would have never done the job which is dueling he just took God at his promise that he would possess the heat of his enemy aren't you convinced tonight that the Gorda was in the Old Testament is the god of the New Testament and the same God to be the Bible says in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] some design inspire you this morning so we talked about david's mighty men we talked about sham de and i want to kind of drive home this to really bring my thought together and you find this story in judges chapter six after the bora what Deborah was judge for about forty years Israel had a time of peace but invariably after a time of peace and everything of the Ryan people begin to lower their guard and fall back and get comfortable and the Bible says in judges six and one and a churn of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and listen carefully and the Lord delivered them into the hand of median seven years I try to get people to understand that actions have consequences people seem to believe and if you repent of a sin it removes the unsee Oh ends of it let me see that again the blood takes away the stain of the sin but your actions have consequences because God is a God of his would that's why I say the way of the transgressor is hard so you walk out the church and do your foolishness they are still consequences even when you come and make a life right you should have to pay the price for what you did so people think they could go on to other one I see a lot of sorry I come back and then what there are no consequences I'm gonna force the issue because he will not be mocked but at random many times for people who come Richard I want to repent and go back to the same thing you don't think God will take action for that so and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord disciplined them and delivered them into the hand of median for seven years God allowed it to happen because the more you step away from the world his principles you cut off your blessing because you are under a different law you are look at the rest of the world because you are under a covenant and God holds you to that covenant can the church say Amen and the hand of median prevailed against Israel and because of the Midianites listen we talk about the America is amor by Zeb today we're gonna bring to a heavy media night and because of the Midianites the churn of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds so instead of living on ice houses and lawn and pulling back and whoever the fellows living in caves and whole animals torn and tree and so it was when Israel had sown that the million eyes came up with their cousins their family the Amalekites and the children of the east even did the public says even did you say this all parties individuals and they came up against them each every issue a week people just like the Midianites the Amalekites we know they're bad and even people of the issue don't even have an army come up with them - and they encounter against them and destroy the increase of the it tilt oh come on to Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel no food for Israel verse 5 for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for a multitude for both thee and their cameras wouid outnumber and the enter into the land to destroy it and israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites and the churn of its will cried unto the Lord I love that because whenever you move away from God move away from God disconnects that cry from God and that's what longs for that cried the relationship that that's actor communication because a lot of people the moment that get some blessing or comforta stop praying the stop crying and stop seek Him but all of a sudden a situation got so bad that the true Devils will begin to cry to the Lord [Music] and it came to pass when the churun of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which senator them that say the Lord or a vision I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and give you the land and I sell at you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorite in whose land he 12 but he have not obeyed my voice so calls reminding them of how powerful he is he is reminding them of what he has done he has reminded them of who he is who they are what a relationship is but he said because you have disobeyed me this is why you going through this is anybody with me this morning and they came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in Afra that pertained under Josh the abyss all right and his son Gideon Tresh suite by the winepress to hide it from the Midianites brother thrashing wheat by the winepress to hide it from the Midianites because he can't trust you wheat in the usual areas because it merely eyes watched you go behind the winepress I'm trusting you be there and the age of the Lord appeared to him and 7 him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor what a declaration so we moved from the Warriors of David to Sangha wide enough to a man who are serious serious serious we call that identity crisis inferiority complex boy i shy I ready nothing this shortened thing I am this is as much as I will lift my hand I come from a conservative background my family we are not that expressive if you come to our house everyone just sits down and stared one another we don't laugh at jokes we don't when I went to school I was like the only person doing what I did and just leave me by myself I didn't come to church to meet anybody and and the Lord appeared unto him and said the Lord is with thee tall mighty man of Valor but get in his shop with it though he said I'm kiddin said oh my lord if the Lord be with us why then is always befallen us and we all his miracles which our father told us off seeing did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but no the Lord had forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the mediator in other words Gideon saying we have learned about miracles but I haven't had my own miracle I know what to go on my father's miracle my grandfather's miracle I was all about it but if you are with us where are all the miracles and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites have not like Cindy and he's never my lord where it's how I see this her behold my family is poor in Manasseh now he bringing out his credentials his resume he said I just wanted to be sure that this mia want my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house I think you have the wrong man and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man can the church say man I know for the young people young people you need to get into the Bible you know I see some people looking at me in shock lady never knew this was in there and as you read that I'm not gonna read all of it but Gideon asked goes for a number of signs are convinced that call is with him and go through them with the fleece and the dry fleece and the west freezer and then verse 7 chapter 7 rather then jerubbaal who is he lien and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitch beside the well of Herod so that the horse of the Midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley and the Lord said to Gideon the people are with thee are too many for me to keep the Midianites into their hands no I want you to understand how God speaks God is seen all around fight and win he said I am giving them into your hands but it's too many listen why less Israel worn themselves against me seeing my own hand had saved me now therefore go to proclaiming the answer the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart Ali from Mount Gilead and a return of the people twenty and two thousand and there he made ten thousand so 22,000 soldiers say you know what I can leave no problem take early part no hard feelings and they remain ten thousand verdict angry and the Lord of the kilian the people are yet too many bring them tone unto the water and I will try them for thee they're not Gideon trying them I will try them for didn't and it shall be that of whom I say unto thee this shall go with me so Peter wasn't even doing the chosen God say I will test them I will approve them a little Dipity list of we're gonna go to fight with because I want to get glory at the outcome of this battle because the battle is that yours or mine it's a lot [Applause] this shall go with the under steam shall go with B and of whomsoever I see any this I'm not going T the same sonikku so he brought down the people unto the water and the Lord senator Gideon everyone and lapid of the water with his tongue as a door Lapid him shadow set by himself likewise everyone that bow down upon his knees to drink and the number of them that lapped putting their hands to their mounts were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bow down upon their knees to drink water yeah damn you just drinking water they even northern a war and then he lapis a dorsal every devil thing today he come and he have another thing coming you know how long they keep taking my food how long they come after much I need water but I a stupid [Applause] ten toes a member only treated only 300 the water lapis they are vigilant they on point because they understand that is wharfing and amateur didn't always warfare know the conventionally drinking awesome I can be criticized for preaching a simple message but I know when Jesus came he brought it so simple that the children could understand rather preach this way and people leave understanding the gospel Jesus and the message and they hear so much complicated thing you need to go get an encyclopaedia later to process finally words and the Lord started to Gideon verse 7 by the 300 men that laughed when I save you and deliver the Midianites into that hand and let all the other people go every man under his place and now the battle staff and he divided a 300 men into three companies 100 100 100 and he put a trumpet in every man's hand with empty pictures and lambs within the pictures and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when I come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as I do you want to do also I want to blow a trumpet I and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon are you ready are you ready so Qian and the hundred men were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle of watch and they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and break the pictures that were in their hands and the tree companies blew the trumpets and break the pictures and held the lamps in their hands and the trumpet in their right hands a blow and they cried the sword of the Lord and of Gideon and it stood every man in his place wrong about the camp and all the hosts ran and cried and fled that the enemy the Muslim and the 300 blew the trumpets and the Lord said every man's sword against his fellow so I want you to picture this the children of Israel children men surrounding the camp bring pictures with a lamb through it a trumpet and people fighting on the among yourself that message from last week suddenly was such a blessing and no part of the fight because God confused their metal fighting [Applause] and the trio two men blew the trumpet and the Lord said every man's sword against his fellow even through all all the hosts and the hosts fled to Bechet sir in Jared enter the board off a Belmont in other words they're gone and the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali and out of a shop and out of all Manasseh and pursued after the Midianites and Hylian sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim seen come down all those who hide him come down all those who have had a long time come down against the Midianites and take them out can the church demon [Applause] that's the Corby sir friends from the message thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy but the Bantam said all these great warriors Gideon David Sampson Shama had to die because they were born and sin they were born by sexual desires sheep in iniquity come to the world speaking nice but being the promise being Abraham's seed by the promise that God gave Abraham these subdued kingdoms and wrought righteousness and stopped the mouths of lions and escaped the edge of a sword moved back waters and raised the dead for they were the seed of Abraham by a promise of God what he would do for them but then finally one day come the Royal seed not born of a man but conceived in a womb of a virgin by God himself with no sexual desire holy spirit born and when the Holy Ghost overshadowed a little virgin and conceived in the air the true seed of Abraham the fear that Abraham had in God God had made a promise of this seed born of a virgin but then he had power over all the kids of the enemy when he was on earth he had the kids of sickness in his power he spoke to the sick and the gates open up and they walked out free he had the keys the leprosy of cripples of affliction of temptations they smacked him in the face and and everything by pulling beard from his face and spitting upon him I'm trying to get him to do something wrong he said I could speak to my father and straightway he'd send me twelve legions of angels he could do it but he had the power why he had the taste that all those other warriors had done victories and so forth but he had to conquer that one who could not be conquered by these men those men could have conquered all kinds of someone yet to conquer what he could not conquer and when he killed him on Calvary his soul descended into hell and he turned the keys on hell down there and unlocked the place and took over he possessed the case of Hell on Easter morning he possessed the case of the grave he has the keys of both death hell and the grave and rose triumph and the church heaven and we you are dead and crying I Abraham's seed and we are more than conquerors through him who conquered everything for us no reason for us to have to overcome anything because it's already conquered the last enemy sickness death temptation all things are put under his feet and we are the seed of Abraham being dead in Christ we are Abraham cease marching order victory to victory to fix you but if I repeat said holding God's promise out before us and going on Abraham's even a sworn promise by Jehovah God that he will possess the kids of every enemy kind of church same hand you love the Lord this morning [Applause] but if I said no death has no key for us death doesn't happen around him no it doesn't what about that you think you die I'll never die I can that I'm already dead my life I'm buried and my life is hidden go to Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost the devil couldn't get me if he had to blessed and holy is he that was part in the first resurrection on which the second death has no power we have overcome because Christ overcame it for us the church see man batter what are we afraid of possess the gates we have God's promise we have his word we have his holy spirit the angels and camped about everything's in order every wall can be took down it's already took down the Son of God calls before us his banners are waving and it's nothing and stand in the way of a safe going to meet a promise of God death can't stop it the grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it we are more than conquerors sickness is conquered for you friends death is conquered for your friends can the church cement Oh blessed be the name of the Lord come on you mighty gentle warriors draw your swords this morning and cut out your inheritance cut out your promise I'm getting ready to close out in a few minutes from the message of first seal here's the pan of it the first thing happens there's an announcement in the heavens first what happened a seal is open and what is that a mystery is unfolded see and run a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it declares a war or a pig falls and a church each open up see what is the war parts the Angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God and then he calls for to the people after the mystery has been given to him goes forth to the people what does he do with it there he begins to proclaim that message and waters it start a war a spiritual war and the church mmm so brother branham the prophet he proclaimed a message a shout message is a call to war that message was through what please us in another Ephesians and this morning we are in another Ephesians and in another Ephesians of faith will be preached Jude exhorted us earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the scenes not if he'd not a belief not a doctrine but DV that the early church had Malachi for him to restore the hearts of the children back to their feet somebody say man so what are we doing this morning we are contending for one Lord one faith one baptism to meet the challenge of the hour and I'm under expectation to see some mighty Gentile warriors draw their swords to step into battle hallelujah hallelujah maybe you've been in the bathroom for a long time maybe you've been in the bathroom of 40 years for 30 years for 20 years maybe you've been hiding in the hills like the true and I visit for a long time but I want to see this morning deliverance is coming your time is coming the easel has already spoken you don't know why this happened why that happened don't worry about it this morning just draw your swords we are gonna fight back this morning there's a war going on but we are not gonna back up we're not gonna give up middle in a backslide what are we fighting for this morning he gave us the best weapons and we ever me that's the Word of God and behind the word he sends a spirit of the Holy Spirit itself dynamics for the mechanics of to bring the word to life and if you schatzi to this mountain it's got to move because the bride will be just like the groom [Music] [Applause] and I believe just as Gideon had to say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon now it's even different with the pride because they're going to be the sword of the Lord the word and his bride because she will be flesh of his flesh she will be bone of his bone so you draw your sword now and watch the devil run watch the devil move on a rampage because a lord is fighting for us this morning Canha Church him and whoa hallelujah all these years we've been coming to

take different Church ages gonna take seven Church ages but when she comes interview it's gonna be an invincible army it's gonna be an unstoppable army it's gonna be an army that cannot be defeated you may be seated can I preach a little bit could it take some more a little bit you may be seated every warrior David Foote he fought and he can see I'm ready to die for this because death he had to die every single warrior had to face that but because of Jesus for the first time there will be a group of warriors who death would not be an option how do you fight the army but a Joshua that you can

will be finished on this earth we are about to finish the battle you may be seated halleluyah [Applause] halleluyah go away go away glory you may be seated in that first age Paul with the Ephesians he give the devil a knockout blow in that age but that was only round one but a candidate the devil he's shook himself and he got back up again and then Iranian scheme and he fought a good fight not the devil out of him but somehow this ever got back up again Irina's Martin Colombo you talk well sleep but a problem came seven shields crawled in the sky but the devil he got back up again but in this age in this bride age God has raised up a gentle army for one purpose and one purpose only to finish what was started [Applause] glory hallelujah hallelujah one purpose and one purpose only you may be seated I want to make it clear to you this morning these warriors stop the motor lions these Warriors did all kinds of stuff but Jesus when he came he was the only one who could deal with this thing called debt [Applause] Joseph had to tell them when I died eat my bones with you brother I don't have such a testimony because I won't die that's a promise that's over me guess no bones will be left you to carry to the promised land there's a promise over me of a new body it's a promise over me good I promise over me oh I feel good morning heal good this morning but before before we can have that we gonna take the devil out we gotta take the devil out the devil you may be seated I'm gonna try to get it I don't know if I'm gonna get Ted you may be seated with the random said in dramatizing TVs mighty man he said the informer Barry carry around that well in Bethlehem he said those minute to cut through all kinds of stuff to get that water and that well of water right now in that well that inexhaustible fountain is everything we have me love and the devil has put all kind of barricades to cut you off trying to keep men from great places but we have men this morning who are drawn their swords sisters who are drawing their swords young people who have drawn their swords [Applause] you may be seated I'm looking for what the lapis this morning you see the enemy if you see the enemies tell him I'm looking for him if you see him tell him I'm coming for him if you see the devil this morning tell him I'm looking for him if you see cancer this morning tell him I'm looking for him you see female condition that's fallen for him because the battle is done my battle is the Lord's battle he said I will choose I will set an order I will place but I will get glory [Applause] oh come on now come on church shake the chains off shake the chains off hallelujah you may not have eaten for a long time but the Midianites the Philistines the Amalekites the Moabites the call them whatever you on them is the same ole devil yes I drew a long time but this morning enough is enough is enough is enough [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah the type in scripture is so perfect I'm trying to close out somewhere the Bible says that God delivered the churn of Israel but this even into the hands of the Midianites for seven years he could have said five years you're gonna step four yet but he saw seven years there's something what's that number seven because something happens after the seventh messenger comes he couldn't do it in the first year he couldn't do it in the second year he couldn't do it in the third year he had to wait until Cillian was in place and when he was in place after the seventh year now he's ready he see the sword of the Lord and of Gideon I declare this morning it's a small of the Lord and his bride because she is in opposition this morning [Applause] hallelujah greeting a little more I'm on page 58 of 70 a doriot small pages you may be seated so just the same way God had to wait for Gideon to be in this place God uses all kinds of people don't write me off because I'm shy don't write me off because I wanna fight but when the Spirit of the Lord come upon me you don't know what problem you gonna meet them don't look at my height don't look at my weight don't look at my color don't look at my country don't look at my mistakes because Gideon he failed God Samson feel God Stanga he was no saint but these were men who knew that he was a sin yesterday the same Turkey and the same forever so don't count me out because God hasn't counted me out can the church see man [Applause] hallelujah so this morning you may be seated I just want to drive this home it's when you watch these tips again I encourage you go and watch back the services so that you keep in the spirit and you know what to expect and you could now go through your life totally differently because if you feed on the teeth of the world your life will reflect the things of the world but if you've seen the things of God it's impossible for you to reflect something else if you feed on God on his word you can only live the word out and that's what God is looking for to be so real to me so tangible and his least desire is your commander you can't wait to be in the house of God you can't wait to be a midweek service you can't wait to read the pile you can't wait to testify because there's at least desires your command you may be seated what are you fighting for but I Ziggy I want to fight for the feet I want to fight for seventh on the revival I'm
