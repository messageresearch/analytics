scripture we want to read um in the Book of Revelation uh tonight amen Revelation chapter 10 you want to read from for a scripture reading tonight um amen and we want to read from 8 to 11 inclusively amen glory all right just kind of getting set up here amen oh God is here tonight amen oh thank God all right so Revelation 10 8 to1 sorry about that um verse 8 says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings may God had blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads and pray one more time oh God it is a privilege to be in your house tonight Lord we stand in a very evil day we see things moving closer towards your prophecies dear God lord as sure as these things are happening around us we know that the promise of the father is also imminent amongst your people tonight so it is under this expectation that we are gathered tonight that your word cannot fail oh God lord we know that we are standing on what you have said so we are uh convinced tonight Lord that your presence is here tonight we just want to surrender ourselves now at the mighty hand of God Lord that you would come and be with your people tonight Lord we are greatly in need of you father and as the hour grows later we are in more need of you father so we're not afraid to cry out Lord and admit these things Lord and seek your face Lord and the baptism of the Holy Ghost we just pray now that your word would as we share the word tonight and as we speak around your word Lord may you come and reveal it Lord in your own sweet way Lord we just want to hide ourselves in your presence and you use us however you want to God you are sovereign and you change not father may you just come and have your way tonight we Just Surrender Lord may you sweep over us and use us in a mighty way and Lord we be careful to give you all the praise honor and Glory tonight as we welcome your presence bless your servant tonight brother ID Lord and Lord the assistant pastor brother Isaac ID father and Lord as they're resting Lord and may anoint them and heal them touch them Father bless them in a mighty way our hearts go out to them Lord Jesus may use your hand of virtue touch them in their bodies Lord and give them strength for the journey that yet lays ahead for us us remember their wives their families there God now bless us now for a few moments as we wait on you in Jesus name we pray and ask it amen and amen glory to God you may have your seats amen it feels good in here tonight we're happy to be in his presence amen thank you so much amen well praise God okay so for just for a few moments tonight we just have a thought I want to share by the grace of God so my title tonight is go and take am that's my title tonight go and take and of course as we know um this comes directly out of the word of God tonight the scriptures that we read um right here in Revelation 10 which you just read tonight amen am and this was a voice that was speaking with John yes um on the aisle of Patmos amen and usually when you read the scripture we read it um under the light of Malachi 4 message of the revealed word sir um which is which is quite all right but tonight I wanted to kind of think about for a few moments John in the context of the scripture just as he is receiving these Heavenly pictures or these Heavenly visions that are coming to him while on the aisle of Patmos in a situation that looked like he's um rejected or looked like he's abandoned or it looked like he was cast away um but that wasn't so in the program of God cuz in God's program he was right where he needed him to be John was right where God wanted him to be so that he could reveal to him these Mighty Revelations that we have as The Book of Revelations as the prophet described as the book of symbols and so forth like that isn't that right so sometimes we feel like we're in a situation where we are Cast Away or we might feel like we're in a place where we were me abandoned or or rejected but sometimes that is exactly where God wants us to be because he can't use us until he's got us alone somewhere where he could speak speak to our hearts and show us something that could shake us into the time and the season that we are living in isn't that right and it's time for the bride tonight to recognize her day and her message and what she is called to do tonight amen and what we see ought to make a church that would make a Revival that people will come flying in to see the seven Thunders that are not even written are being made manifest upon the people the seeed that the people have found that lost coin that the that the bride had lost throughout the ages the bride at the end time is going to find that coin that was lost and the prophet said when she finds her brotherly love when she finds her holy decency and when the church finds her place in Christ then she's going to call to the other members of the body and she'll say come and rejoice with me come and rejoice with us because we found something that we have lost amen isn't that right amen and I was so inspired by Brother ovid's message on Sunday amen talking about going back to something Hallelujah that once was that God had once delivered to the church amen going back to the apostolic faith going back to the typos going back to the old Landmark that was set in the book of Acts where holy men spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost oh and it's a Holy Ghost Land of promises that we are promised to go back to in this day oh Hallelujah and tonight I believe that we are inspired that there is a group on the Earth tonight that are inspired to go and take what God has for you tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah we're here tonight we're here to go we're here to take it amen and that word take just kept coming to me over and over and as I dove into it this is what Cann of come out go and take the book that voice that spoke with John yes here it is he saw the mighty Angel come down clothed with a clown Hallelujah rainbow upon his head feet as it were pillars of fire face shining like the sun Hallelujah isn't that right and he had in his hand this little book open isn't that right and he's instructed by this by the voice that speaketh with him saying go to that angel and take the book isn't that right and I love how that voice spoke to him The Voice didn't say go to a man it didn't say go to a group it didn't say go to an organization but it said go to that angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth that has the book in his hand and take the book that is in his hand isn't that right and so we're talking about go and take and this speaks of two things isn't that right first we have to go isn't that right going is a sense of direction you have to know where you're going in order to go where you're going you can't just go anywhere it's not being led by your own mind isn't that right in John's account of the angel of Revelation 10 John is pointed in the direction of this Angel and he is told to go and take the little book that is open in the hand of that angel he wasn't sent to a man he was sent to that angel and we believe the True Church of God today isn't being led by a man but it's being led by that angel it is not a group it is not an organization it's not a group think it is not how we feel about it oh but the angel of the Lord is sent to go everywhere with us and confirm the word of God with signs one do and with Miracles following isn't that right who is that angel let's answer that question tonight the prophet said here is anything too hard for the Lord uh in paragraph 26 he says remember Jesus Christ the son of God Amen said that same thing would repeat again yes as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man that God would be working through human flesh oh hallelujah hallelujah he wants to work through human flesh oh Hallelujah so thinking not strange you are here tonight God wants to work through your flesh tonight he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet but God is raising up a bride in this last day to be a witness of his resurrection power in this lisian age do you believe it tonight God wants to work through you tonight he wants to use your hands he wants to use your feet he wants to use your mouth he wants to go where you go Hall and at the right time he put words in your mouth Hallelujah to speak to them to confound the wise because it'll be the wisdom of God God speaking not the wisdom of man amen oh Hallelujah that God would be working through human flesh doing the same thing that he did then amen he'd be doing it today isn't that right oh God Prophet said help us to wake up the day of visitation is here you say oh God doesn't send Angels anymore he said but the holy spirit is that angel oh there's our answer tonight who's that angel the prophet said that the holy spirit is that angel he said the holy spirit is that person oh that person of Christ oh Hallelujah Halle the holy spirit it's not you it's not me it's a person he said the Holy Spirit Jesus said he the Holy Ghost the prophet said when he comes comes when he comes he will do the works that he did he be with us even in us and he would bring things to our remembrance that he taught and would show us of things to come oh Hallelujah isn't that right glory to God hallelujah hallelujah when Jesus come back Amen in his resurrection Ministry he unlocked their understanding to the scriptures and many of the things he shared with them when he was yet with them in Galilee and in Jerusalem and and different places but in that hour oh hallel the word was not yet quickened to them but when he come back after his death his burial and his resurrection he come back to them and he breathed upon them receive you the Holy Ghost and all of a sudden the word that they were hearing all the while was finally quickened to them do finally quickened to them oh he the Holy Spirit he Jesus Christ was finally revealing back the word to them that they had already heard oh he was recycling back all of the promises isn't that right and the prophet said God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises oh Hallelujah outside of them promises he cannot meet us because we cut ourselves off from it oh that is why we preach the promises tonight oh every Sunday every Wednesday we preach those promises oh the Holy Ghost belongs to you you shall be filled you shall be sealed you shall be a witness you shall be adopted every Sunday every Wednesday every Friday evening oh prayer service and whatever preach those promises oh Hallelujah seven Thunders oh Hallelujah a promise to come into you a bir a bir a bir oh Hallelujah seven births oh seven spirits oh seven manifestations of one Holy Spirit God deals with the church and he deals with the individual the same way and then he caps off the individual with charity and seals you in and seals the world out oh how many tonight want to be sealed in and seal the world out the baptism of the Holy Ghost is about to be released tonight oh we feel it in the atmosphere brother brandham said the skies are filled with the Pentecostal rain tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah the promise of my father behold I send a promise of my father upon you and Hallelujah and I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh oh he's about to do it tonight God cannot lie God cannot fail he is not a man that he would lie but his promises true oh is anything too hard for God oh what an evil age we live in oh hallelujah it's terrible there's crimes everywhere there's persecution there's Injustice brother Stephen all kind of a manner of Filth going on oh Hallelujah but right in the midst of all of this God's going to release a power upon the church right in this end time right in all the mess that the devil has done God's going to come right in Satan's Eden right in the midst of all his doings and he's going to perform his work His Marvelous work oh and he's going to raise up a bride unto Perfection oh and she'll steal away to disguise to be with Jesus oh when the devil realizes what has happened it'll be too late he'll be hopping mad then but it'll be too late the bride would have already gone and she'd have had a testimony that she pleased God that's right amen yes sir we will have a testimony that we please God right in the midst of this evil age this unor generation amen oh my so we're looking forward for that so we're living in that day see the prophet said he the Holy Ghost when he comes he will do the works that he did that's right he'd be with us even in us and he would bring things to our remembrance that he taught and show us things to come he said the works that I do shalt he do also he said now we're living in that day we're living in that timej and the prophet said also here and am against organized religion 1962 he said and this Angel's message messenger come from God here he says it again was echoing his message on the earth to come out of Babylon come out of organizations the voice of God isn't that right crying through the Prophet come out of Babylon come out of organizations come out of confusions and mess isn't that right and men's ideas come out of fig leaves isn't that right the Holy Spirit today the prophet said the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word hey you know it amen because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word oh that's why he's trying to get you back to the word because he can only vindicate the word people throughout the years got off the Beaten Track with this idea and this interpretation and that has been the devil's trick all along can you stay with that word can you stay focused long enough can you keep your eye on the promise can you keep your mind on Jesus Oh the the Bible says I will give him perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Jesus whose mind is stayed on me oh oh Hallelujah just like Elisha was he had his eye on that Prophet Elijah and wherever he went he didn't take his eye off that Prophet because that Prophet had something he needed and what he had wasn't good enough oh Al he said I need what that man has I got to get that mantle he passed through beta he passed through gilgal he come through the school of the prophets he come through big educations but that didn't Shake him because he had his eye on the prize and that's how we've got to be tonight we've got to be so focused on the Holy Ghost for this day we've got to be so focused on the manifestation of the Holy Spirit today oh that we won't turn to the left that we won't turn to the right but God put a revelation in our hearts oh that we stand the test of time that throughout every adversary throughout every persecution throughout every Darkness though he slay me yet I'll trust him because I know there's coming a day where the sun will rise again oh that bride will have an Easter oh there will be an Easter again for the bride and that ASO and of God will raise oh with power with healing in his wings with Revival oh how the church today is growning for Revival we want Revival we need a Revival to boil the trash out of the church oh we've got a longing in our hearts tonight a longing for Jesus a longing for the moving of the spirit are longing for that August being to fill this headstone Tabernacle tonight for that milky presence to sweep in here and the sick will be healed the crippled will walk the blind will see and the gospel will be preaching its power oh there's coming a day tonight oh and we believe it's on the road our faith declares it to be so surely God will visit us tonight I'm here to encourage you not many days hence he will surely visit visit us tonight amen so let's get on fire we are right in the season of it tonight trying to get the people back to the word that's been this Angel's Mission all along what did God tell Moses go in there with a mighty hand and deliver this people out of Egypt and bring them back to this mountain so that they could worship me Hallelujah isn't that right Moses had a ticket pray a round trip flight to bring the people right back to the mountain to worship God they had been a stranger a foreigner Hallelujah in a Strange Land for hundreds of years oh H God heard the cries of his people but when the alarm clock was ready to go off God was ready to set in motion his plan of Deliverance his plan of power his plan to bring his people out oh Hallelujah I believe tonight that plan is also in motion tonight oh the Lord himself has descended from heaven with a shout oh to pull you out of Darkness to rip you out of leosia to rip you out of the hand of Egypt to rip you out of the hand of Lucifer and to put you in there and to place you in there and to slot you in there into the pyramid by the Holy Ghost and Fire God is going to bur a people oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh I believe it tonight that's why I'm here tonight not to occupy a church bench but to receive the spirit of Christ that the early church had we're here to go we're here to take what's rightfully ours we're here to take what rightfully belongs to us tonight because that's what he died for amen and amen See it'll only vindicate a word it can't vindicate dogmas there's no life in there see so we've got to go we know where we're going tonight yes sir the voice says go to that angel isn't that right the holy spirit is the great end time leader to lead the people just like Joshua led the children of Israel into their inheritance into the land of promise the Holy Ghost today is our Joshua to lead us into our inheritance our Holy Ghost Land of promises isn't that right so to take we go in and we take in amen simple word tonight we go in and when we go up there we're going to take something and to take means to possess isn't that right it could also mean to repossess to take back to take back from the devil to take back from the enemy what he stole from you he stole your joy well you're here t tonight to take it back because it rightfully belongs to you oh Hallelujah we have a revelation tonight of what is rightfully ours hle and we're here to take what is ours tonight we have an instruction a supernatural instruction to go and to take hallu and John represents the bride isn't that right so we're seeing ourselves in the scripture here tonight we are receiving also this instruction to go to the angel and to take that book isn't that right now um uh to take to take back right we can also say redeem is that right we go to take we can also say to restore or to restore back what was uh uh previously lost isn't that right an example is love this is when Caleb said let us go up at once and take the land amen that God sworn to our fathers to give us isn't that right Hal hallelujah amen so what the children of Israel so here's a point we're trying to make what the children of Israel was doing as an act of possession was also an act of repossession isn't that right so it was like possession and repossession was happening at the same time because the children of Israel was going back for the land that God had sworn to their fathers God called Abraham out isn't that right so many years ago and said I give you this land isn't that right look to the north look to the South look to the East and the West all this land belongs to you isn't that right but then that horrible dream Came Upon him isn't that right and God showed him that this people would sojourn in a Strange Land and with a mighty hand he would bring them out amen hallelujah and that prophecy unfolded over time until it come down into Joseph and how they came out from there into Egypt and sojourned there isn't that right praise God and that whole thing unfolded but that land where they lived praise God was originally where God had placed his his uh his his people at that time that was a land that he swore unto their fathers to give them Hallelujah isn't that right but now it had been overrun with Hittites and jebusites and parasites so God send Moses down there to get my people out not just to deliver them from slavery not just to save you from sin but to bring you out into your own land a land of possession a land of inheritance a land flowing with milk and honey a land flowing with the Holy Ghost a land with healing in it a land with Deliverance in it a land with breakthrough in it yes there's wars in the land but God promised to give you Victory and as Caleb said if the Lord be with me then I shall be able to drive out the enemy as the Lord had said oh Hallelujah you have the ability tonight oh God is with us and he's going to help us to drive out all of the foreigners in this land and establish for us a land PR a Holy Ghost Land of promises amen so you see that that tonight amen it was a repossession of the land that he originally established with Abraham and Isaac and so forth like that they were coming back to repossess and in their possession or in their possessing they were also repossessing isn't that right and it makes me think of what we are called to do in this last days we are called to possess a land a Holy Ghost Land of promises another Ephesians and the best part about it is that it was once delivered to the Saints oh we're not talking about a new thing it's not a new theology it's not a new idea oh Hallelujah isn't that right but it was once delivered Peter once had it Mary once had it oh they received that coin and you are going to receive that same Penny tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that Gentile bride that 11 hour worker is promised to receive the same pay the same Penny the same Holy Ghost oh hallelujah hallelujah if he healed in times past he's going to heal today because he's the same God tonight if that God if that spirit that raised Christ from the dead ever dwells in your body he will do the same Works he did in you like he did back then if he healed a sick then he'll heal the sick today if he deliver then he'll deliver tonight if he made more way if he restored if he did Miracles he'll do it again tonight because he's the same God doing the same things acting the same way like they did in the upper room oh they were drunk men they came out with stammer and lips people wanted to know what noise is this oh Hallelujah Hallelujah and Peter spoke to them hallelujah oh by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and they were pricked in their hearts Hallelujah and as men and Brethren what shall we do to be saved my that same spirit is coming back again do you believe it tonight so there's both a possession and a repossession being done amen is that right through the bride in the last days and that isn't that right repos we're reclaiming going back amen taking backwards rightfully hours it's a work of restoration restoring the church again isn't that right or rebuilding the church again under the power of the spirit Seven Virtues God is now bringing us back into our inheritance isn't that right yes sir and this little book we find Revelation 5 was a closed book so we said go and take the ink the book that is in the hand of the angel that was open right but in Revelation 5 it was actually a closed book no man was found worthy to take that book needed to look there on so this act of taking this book that was in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne this act of Taken was an authoritative right isn't that right a right to take a right to possess a right to take up a a position or to take up an authority but the Bible said no man was found worthy no man in Heaven Nor in the earth neither under the Earth Hallelujah was able to open the book neither to look thereon and John said I wept much because no man was found worthy isn't that right but one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seal thereof and behold and L in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth isn't that right and he came and the Bible said he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book oh aren't you glad he took the book tonight because he took it you can now take it for yourself oh no man was found worthy to take it but because he took it oh now you are being told to go and take the open book that is in the hand of this Mighty Angel oh what a privilege what an honor do we have tonight oh Hallelujah because he overcame you are going to overcome also because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh oh Hallelujah because he died you died in him and when he rose you Rose victoriously and when he took that book oh John said they sung a new song saying thou was worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God out of every Kindred and nation and tongue and so forth isn't that right oh my Hallelujah he possessed it took it and then that possession was a repossession because this book was Adam had it first isn't that right the first Adam he created and he was supposed to speak the names from that book but he fell by sin and he never got to be unfolded and as we always say the devil tried to grab a hold of it at that time but because his hands was slippery amen because he had greasy hands of unbelief he couldn't hold on to that book and that book went back into the hands of the original owner the him who sat on the throne with it in his right hand waiting for a worthy kinsman redeemer to step forward and reclaim what was originally lost through Adam and the fall oh Hallelujah so when he came and took the book it was a possession but it was also a repossession a retaking of our inheritance oh isn't that right Hallelujah and the prophet said in that book was a book of redemption oh and in that book was all the names that was to be called your name was there my name was there but no one was found worthy to unseal to loose and to Break Free the contents of the book no one was worthy to open and to loose and to break free your life from out of the book of life but one was found worthy tonight oh Behold a lamb slain before the foundation of the world he was worthy to open the book tonight and that is why I'm here tonight to shout and to give God praise because someone was found worthy oh to save you and I to redeem you and I and because he took it we can now take our inheritance oh our inheritance in life everything that Adam lost can now be restored to us in this last day because he took it first amen amen he went out first he took the bullet as it was died for us paid a price to make a way for rest of us to come rid in through salvation come riding through all the way through the Redemption the Lamb of God that uh uh paid for the sins of the world isn't that right oh my we love him tonight Deuteronomy 29:29 says the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law Hallelujah so once it is a secret Jesus said isn't that right it remains a secret isn't that right Jesus said it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which your father had put in his power hallah it's not for you to know the times they were asking him as he was ascending into heaven how long when are these things going to be uh they were anxious they were nervous they knew that the end was coming and they wanted they had a question on their hearts as their master was leaving them this glorified Son of God and the answer he gave them was that it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power in other words I can't tell you the time the father has that in his mind that's his secret that belongs to him uh God is Sovereign and he is allowed to keep what he wants to keep but whatever he reveals to you that belongs to you tonight whatever he opens or unveils to you that actually belongs to us tonight so we now may not know when tonight but what we do know Jesus said is that you shall receive power I can't tell you when it's going to happen all you have to do is T in the upper room wait in Jerusalem I can't tell you when but I can tell you one thing of assurance that you shall receive power you are going to receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you and you're going to be a witness a witness of Jesus Christ on the earth you're going to walk and talk like Jesus Christ you're going to do the work works that he did you're going to heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils all that was G Christ would be poured into the church at that hour oh won't it be a time tonight when he fully manifest himself oh it is going to happen tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh if it's revealed it belongs to you if your healing has been revealed then that belongs to you if your inheritance has been revealed then that belongs to you tonight if your deliverance your breakthrough whatever you have need of doesn't matter how the devil tries to keep it from you if it is revealed the Gates of Hell cannot stand cannot Prevail against divine revelation from God oh you could burn me at the steak oh you could boil me roast me chop my head off you cannot change what God has put in my heart oh and if God put something in your heart tonight it shall happen because God said so oh hallelujah oh he promised the Holy Ghost and we're here to receive it tonight he promised Deliverance he promised a breakthrough he promised Deliverance at that time Michael shall stand up and begin to deliver every name that is on the book oh Hallelujah all your sons all your daughters once their name is in that book they cannot Escape God's hour of Deliverance tonight oh give the Lord a praise of Give the Lord a shout I don't care what their mental condition is I don't care if they're sick I don't care if they're weary I don't care if they're on their last or the voice of God that called Lazarus from the grave that voice is promised to be on on the earth to call you to call your loved ones to call your daughters to call your sons from far oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen there is going to be a great Deliverance there is going to be a great outpouring there is going to be a great coming together Gathering of eagles just before that end time oh we can't wait we we're just under expectation tonight oh hallelujah oh hallelujah our soul says yes amen hey this is what we want this is what we come to church for to see this Supernatural God Break Out Among Us with healings and deliverances outpouring of the Holy Spirit isn't that right on Aza Street there was no program they didn't say it had Tides here and singing here and preaching here it was just a flow of the spirit they would sit and then had to sing a song all of a sudden songs start to sing everybody singing oh then when the song di down prophecy stand up somebody begin to speak in tongues somebody G to interpret in tongues just the spirit flowing in and when the atmosphere felt right old brother seimo would stand up and he would go to the pulpit and begin to preach the word of God and the people bore Witness that the glory of God was upon brother Sour's face and when he was finished the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost would sweep out upon the audience and baptize the people and Minister and heal and deliver is that what we're coming back to of course praise all is preaching and word and word and word but we're going to switch over one day to the ministry of the spirit that will Quicken that word to you make it alive by many infallible proofs oh undeniable oh Hallelujah with assurance that it is God not mental telepathy not the wisdom of man but the spirit of God at work Discerning the hearts of men casting down human reasoning breaking down Pride all that come in there with lust and lies shall be skilled broken apart and God will Minister and meet the need of everyone that's what we're looking for so we on expectation tonight amen hallelujah for what God is about to do oh let me hurry along we still have a little more here so once it's a secret it remains a secret it's not for you to know it's not right but you shall receive power that's what we do know that's what was revealed God didn't tell us when but he told us what would happen when that time comes and there will be evidence that it is the time now H and Peter said this is not this are these people are not drunk as you suppose but this is that that the prophet Joel speak of amen and there'll be a bride on the earth tonight who will step forward and say this is that that Malachi 4 spoke of oh Hallelujah we born and positionally born God will set in the church Apostles of prophets teachers evangelists and so forth this is that here it is here amen oh Hallelujah is not right okay let me skip in there we got all this wonderful amen exposition of seven Church ages Revelation Jesus Christ said if Revelation is beyond you Prophet said look up and seek God for it he said that is the only way you're ever going to get it so if you want to go and take tonight it's got to be revealed to you what you're going to take this is it here if the if it's beyond you look up and seek God that is the only way you're ever going to get it amen a revelation has to come from God he said it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual enduement you can even memorize the scripture he said and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have to receive the holy ghost He said and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus Christ Jesus is the Christ God the anointed one oh how we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight isn't that right he promised it let's be under expectation he said no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God is revealing it to them so no man can know the things of God unless between the spirit of God and the man to whom it's being revealed that that communication is taking place isn't that right it must be a direct line isn't that it can't come through a Library of Congress or or some other high and mighty place no no no it's got to come straight from God isn't that right it's a relationship between you and the spirit of God revealing things showing you things isn't that right just like in Eden when God had fellowship with man and spoke to him in the cool of the evening God wants to establish that relationship with you tonight and that is how we will ever know the things of God isn't that right we need to call on the prophet said we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world he said we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it is still not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there and the word has not been quickened he said wow food for thought right okay so let's move on quickly so by revelation we are going we are going tonight amen we're going to a land of possession God promised us a land and it's a Holy Ghost Land of promises where we are actually going to take and possess again amen praise God Omega bride possessing again isn't that right Hallelujah okay Matthew 11:12 it says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and the violence take it by force oh there's that word take again oh Hallelujah God wants and requires a certain kind of an attitude from you oh hallelujah it's got to be a certain level of of Grimace oh h of of of of of of determination of persistence isn't that right like that woman isn't that right whose daughter was vexed with the devil they said she was crying continually crying continually towards God toward Jesus at that time isn't that right until she became a nuisance until she became a nuisance to the disciples oh H and say they want to know why this dog is bothering us because she's of A different race she's of a different culture she's a woman for crying out loud why is she bothering Jesus but that woman had a need she didn't care what they called her she didn't care what they said about her her daughter was vexed with the devil and when you have a need you don't care what they call you you don't care what they say to you even Jesus said oh it's not fit to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord that's true but I'm a dog I accept that and all I want tonight is just some crumb from off the master's table oh if I am a dog oh then surely the dogs could get something tonight oh Hallelujah surely there's something a little extra something a little left over after all the children have eaten surely the dogs could get something tonight oh I come for whatever I come for the crumbs oh what you come for tonight are you under [Music] expectation hallu hallu we are not dogs we are not Castaways we are children of the father and yet this woman with a Persistence of spirit was able to get something from the Lord with her attitude isn't that right oh Hallelujah because she said the right thing praise God she got what she wanted hallelujah amen amen hallelujah isn't that right praise God so don't worry if you come across a little Annoying praise God that's exactly what God wants keep at it until you get what you come for amen amen oh the faith that was once delivered to the Saints the faith that we're going to receive possess and possess tonight was actually once delivered huj once before isn't that right and it will be delivered again yes sir it's a work of restoration isn't that right restoration of the Bri tree the prophet said here 1962 he said now I rush home and got my dictionary and so forth some scripture notes begin to copy things down then I got Webster's Dictionary to find find out the right definition for the word restore he looked it up he said to restore means to return to the former owner or to bring back to the former estate of condition oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right before sin came in the picture you were perfect oh Hallelujah without blemish you are spotless you only come now born in sin shaping iniquity you come into the world speaking lies but before the beginning oh before there was a moon before there was a star you were perfect in God's mind so this work of restoration is to bring you back to a state of condition that you once had in before the beginning oh hallelujah it's only the devil's lie that you come into this condition but this is not your only home this is not your only hope where was down when I laid the foundations of the earth and the morning Stars sang together and the Sun of God shouting for Joy you were those sons of God tonight shouting for Joy you were those sons of God tonight shouting and leaping and praising God you saw the lamb took the book and loosed the seals oh Hallelujah isn't that right amen amen it's a work of restoration Hallelujah that I will restore okay to restore to a former owner to bring back to a former estate of condition he said and we can enforce a claim to be restored he said that that's what Webster says to bring back to the former owner or to back bring back to a former state of condition and if a claim is made on something see you take it you're claiming something uh to make that restoration the prophet said you can enforce it and make it come back to its rightful place oh Hallelujah isn't that right praise God he said may God bless these feeble words he say so to restore means to bring back to restore a claim can be enforced isn't that right Hallelujah so he said to restore a claim can be enforced isn't that right now to bring anything back to his rightful owner where it belongs he said therefore some way it went from its rightful owner it can rander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to who really owns it oh hallelujah hallelujah you might have been lost in sin lost in filth lost in the world but if you belong to God then there's a claim going out tonight to restore you back to where you once was oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right glory to God that's why that seed in your soul cannot be lost because if God put that seed in there doesn't matter what condition arounds the seed has a law in it and the law of life that is in Christ Jesus Oh is in that sea tonight oh and that law is what sets you free from the law of sin and death oh Hallelujah they could put you in a bar they could put you in a rum shop but that seed was always in there oh how you could be around marijuana around the wrong company but if God put that seed in there tonight there's a time there's a countdown on that seed oh at the right hour at the right season Once light strikes that seed it's got to come back to life oh hallelujah hallelujah amen amen and there's a la to enforce this rightful condition to enforce it so it's like you put in an application for something but now you could enforce that and and and make it happen praise God say I put this through now where is what you promised me the payment has already been made now where is what you promised me you could come with the policeman isn't that right you could come with the enforcer oh and re enforce the claim that you have made and that is what the angel of God is here to do tonight that angel is on the earth tonight he is fixing things around that angel the manifestation of the holy spirit that angel is here to enforce every claim that you make oh so if you claim the Holy Ghost tonight that big Burly Angel the one of the sweat back Wings he is here tonight to make sure you get what you ask for oh if you ask for healing you're going to get it if you ask for your sealing you're going to get it the enforcer is here to make sure you get what you ask for oh do you believe it tonight oh my oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God enforcement praise God Prophet said like if somebody stole some property they're holding a property captive then you can take the law go to this person and the law forces and forces this person to restore this property back to its natural owner into its liable First Estate musicians can get ready I'm almost finish amen enforcement he says oh what a text praise God he said I'd like to have uh two days on that he said he said he said then there we are he said we have the privilege he said to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us oh because remember he died for it blood has been paid already there's no more price to be paid now it's time for enforcement he has no right tonight to be dwelling on your property to be dwelling on the things that God paid for you to have that's why we always say you are living under your god-given privileges as a Christian as a son and daughter of God he paid for your healing tonight he paid for your deliverance tonight oh how we ought to have faith and rise up and claim every promise of God that he died for oh Hal we could claim it tonight oh make your claim tonight make your claim in prayer make your claim in faith make your claim in believing knowing that God is faithful to his promise he is faithful to his word and he is true isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah oh we almost finished my but do you see it tonight amen he said what is it en forcing give it back you see that's what we're talking about restore means to bring it back to its right owner and if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or a daughter of God he said we have a right this morning and we say tonight by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God and to bring it back if he's Afflicted you made you sick we have the right before God to enforce the laws of God by his stripes we are healed amen bring him back turn him loose you're taking him out yonder of death and we claim him and bring him back right now enforcement oh isn't that right amen Oh Glory to God hallelujah oh amen one more thought praise God and get ready uh as we get ready to wind down amen he's talking about Joshua here he said as I was with Moses so I be with thee he said now Joshua the new Warrior only two left now that'll ever reach the Promised Land was Joshua and Caleb now Joshua the new Commander LED an army step into that place where a great man like Moses stood it was no little task he said and I think of a minister today that's called of God to step in the tracks where Jesus stood he said what a command what a commission you can begin to play something softly but each of you uh but each of that called of God each of us that's called of God is commissioned to stand in that same place he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each minister is called to stand where he did the works that I do shall you do also each minister is ordained of God to is command to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed Prophet said that's quite a command and how it must have felt when Joshua standing there that morning talking to God he said I will not fail thee as I was with Moses so will I be with you no man shall stand before for you all the days of your life I'll destroy and devour I'll make the weight clear only be strong and be very courageous be not dismayed or worried don't be afraid he said I'm with you I'll see you through what a commission to be given to this man called Joshua he said and now there's great types here that I could go into but we'll bypass some of them and so forth like that he said and the uh he said but for instance Moses was the church age that brought them to sin to their theology but Moses wasn't permitted to take the children of Israel into the promised land because he had failed he said in a church organization denomination has failed they'll not take the church over he said but God will raise up a new system a Inter denominal National system by the power of God that will take the church into the promised land you we can understand organizations and denominations has messed it up each one after their own theology each one after their own way of thinking but God will take his Holy Spirit and he will raise his joshuas like he did and will take the church to the promise with no denominational strings tied anywhere he will take over his church Moses had failed as a lawgiver but Joshua was called of Grace and he took the church on oh do you believe tonight that Joshua the holy spirit is going to take you on into your promised land tonight I'm finished may the Lord bless you hey praise God as our brother steeve very gets ready to come and sing oh let's give him praise tonight oh let us go and take it tonight oh the land belongs to us oh he promised it
