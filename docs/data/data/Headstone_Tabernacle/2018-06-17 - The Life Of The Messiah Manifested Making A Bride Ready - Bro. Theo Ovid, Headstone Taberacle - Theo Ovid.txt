so that we the kongtong is on for the convention we are looking for a tremendous time and the Lord and remember no Minister could bring a revival the revival have to come by you the people and I just love what God did he put the vision to be brought directly to the people you see because God is a God of the audience and any original the pillar of fire was among God's people and then the devil came in with a Nicollet and spirit and and put it upon men and then on a man and then died so again up with the Pope but God has awarded the audience say God wanted tabernacle in you not only the five for ministry and ministry and minister no God come to dwell in his people the Destry stage has gone above us God with us and God in us Oh hallelujah but we call we in this thing called this I call this they what they think of train this please call train and because things have to be unfolded in time it have gifts and position and places because of this time element that we in oh jesus knew all things we don't jesus knew all things we don't but we're gonna come to that place in st. john 14 20 that day you shall know I am and the father ye and me and I in you so we are grateful to God to be called in this last day to serve Him and I want to let you know you are called the perfectionist lastly I want you to be thinking about it and speaking it don't just stay like you know is something in the word no no this is your calling you actually called it a perfection not called to be ordinary leave ordinary for ordinary people you are not ordinary before there was a moon before there was a star don't let the devil tell you ordinary you are not ordinary Peter was not ordinary John was not ordinary jeans are not on there and there you're not ordinary [Applause] [Music] you have a body you have a spirit you have a soul not everybody have that in that order and in your soul of a seed the foolish listen they have no seed in their soul they received a word in that way you have a seed and that is why God could come to you that is why they typically do a big my bed in hell he is dear you can't get away from it we believe that this evening oh praise the name of the Lord praise God praise God praise God someone of a place for a seed 1/2 please no seed at all sipping seed no seed no see going at all no seed Oh glory to God the evil on the earth but you are represent the seed of the righteous that God want to bless you can't be replaced so don't think God trying to get rid of you to get somebody has to take your place you are irreplaceable right now I want you to believe that God has not trying to replace you for trying to perfect you [Applause] I'm not hearing enough amens we want to get the unbelief over here I want to say it again God is not trying to replace you God is wanting to perfect you you want to conform you he want you to be a Christian getting baptized doesn't make you a Christian taking communion doesn't make a Christian believe any message doesn't make a Christian Christ makes you a Christian the Holy Ghost is what makes you a Christian knowing all the mysteries doesn't make you a Christian hearing all the world doesn't give a Christian behavior it has the compression side of you then what could be handled inside of you the word has to become flesh could I hear shouting that all what you're here and has to come inside of you you have to become a Living Bible we start here this morning you have to become the Living Word if people carry the Bible they have to read you because a lot of shout some people don't want to read they don't care about reading but they're gonna see your walk they're gonna see your talk they're gonna see the anointing upon you may be seated praise gone demons the last week Sunday we speak about the reflection is the perfection and I want to continue this morning and okapis time for the scriptures we want to go to Matthew 5:48 2nd Corinthians 3 1 2 3 and also 2nd Peter 1:4 2:7 that's Matthew 5:48 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 1 2 3 and 2nd Peter 1:4 to 7 then we're gonna read occupy 48 be therefore perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect that's an order written in red from Jesus and from 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 1 the tree do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as other epistles of commendation to you or letters of recommendation from you you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men so Paul was saying these disciples they could read you for as much as he our watch manifested Lee declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart 2nd Peter 1 you didn't from verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world to lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things being you and abound they shall make you that ye shall need neither be barren unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ let's pray father we thank you for your word we thank you for your presence we pray a comment to your world Lord forgive us where we are filled you one fall short and not live up to the life that you require of us come with your cleansing power this morning take us out of the way father and speak to our hearts sanctify our hearts our minds are hearing that we will hear the word of God may your bring us into the spirit I made a revealing anointing with the Holy Spirit come and confirm your word with science one of the miracles in this and we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise God good to see you brother Vijay god bless you prisoner in there ah the title this morning oh but a a VG is given God prays for healing virtue and probably seen to the prayer on his behalf amen praise the Lord amen our title the life of the Messiah manifested making a bride ready of a subject the reflection is the perfection an inspiration cry out to God that's what I have an inspiration crying out to God from perfect feet so we in the word now let's go from perfect feet but a Branham was speaking and he was saying this is coming into that tooth pose I remember he was given the minister of Jesus Christ in triples and he's speaking on a poofy thing this is coming to the temple and believing it now I won't they actually are since a question you did pass through the prayer line can you actually believe and feel now that there is something happen in you since you had hands laid on you regions there it is this is what I've been waitin for no this is not no no this is just starting to bloom no just that I did this for a purpose I did this for a purpose I am working on something see I am taking this charge of feet and I'm going right back to begin and come in see the kind of raised faith and a bracket where you'll never notice it that way before not not a feet but a perfect feet build it up in here and watch a perfect God with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by His perfect world what we are coming now to the perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture come on now CNN so we don't want to talk rapture that generating everybody wrapped it erupted after no no no no no before you get there you have to come to hear the people after coming to dis now what we talking about perfection and perfection never a beginning never an end them so you're talking about something that's outside a train we've got much something for eternity that could come and influence your life you can't make this up you can implicit this you can't pretend this Oh glory to God hallelujah glory if brother Branham was pretending to the bull the bull was gonna kill him he couldn't pretend you have to talk the language yet to talk the language the bull understands he understood the language of love or that language of love nothing could conquer it it's the greatest force there is because charity never faileth see you're not gonna fail this Love's gonna fail but this power we talking about the tenon sail and the devil don't want you to see that that you have a right to access that but Peter give the ladder hope the claim to that this is a PSA flew to knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness come on don't stop there because you have to go higher look at the Lord a shout Oh glory to God you are sons and daughters have access to that which is perfect my quarter no feel like preaching or glory to God hallelujah prophecies gonna fail tongues gonna cease but when that which is perfect is come hallelujah Cepeda Miriam says we are commented that to the perfection now because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture that is what is holding it right now it's waiting for the church to comment to that perfect rapture faith looking for it it means a lot of Shaving don't for me now remember but her mom was alive right he himself looking for the rapture it means a lot of shipping no for me it means a lot for you but together we will make it by the grace of God or give the Lord some praises or glory to God you do with a broom you know you just leave with a bleed so in that context let me read this again it means I never even known for me let me receive enough for you you ever say a carpenter shaving wood trying to get the right angle Shh so when you see the blade coming about oh god you're not yet turn not yet next service I'll figure next week no you're ready yet you must want perfection you must want God to come and do the season let them start to team you don't want an organizational life you don't want a son the Christian life and money living like a devil you want a Christian life every day what about him says what he said no the reason Christians I think it's so real tonight that we should live the right kind of a life because you see many people won't take time to read the Bible but they will read you you are written epistles of God our real true born-again Christian is the word expressed again because you are written epistles of God rather of all men what type of person should we be if we know that our lies is an open living Bible to the unbeliever to express God in our own life so tonight we would hunger and thirst to see the Lord Jesus Christ we as Christians should reflect his life so much till it should be his entire representative we should be that every Christian should be a representative and reflect the life of Jesus Christ so you don't represent this church you don't represent me you represent a kingdom where your father is the king you represent a life of power influence Oh glory to God that's what I told him a new year I represent the kingdom of the Most High God God told me to say that I wasn't representing Trinidad I representing a kingdom so I don't care what people think I'm bringing word from the kingdom as long as the kingdom is behind me doesn't matter what man say because I'll batter from the kingdom the kingdom of a king the kingdom of an army the kingdom of a power the kingdom of protection or we get the Lord a show [Applause] doesn't represent a Minister Association group of men represent this group or the state no not represent the kingdom if what you are inside of you that people read not so much what you see but what you not what you say that's right not all this yappity yappity app because there are three Bibles zodiac Perman this written Bible now this pyramid Bible is what you see if reflecting colors fade virginal but this have to come into you so all the mysteries in the physical Bible is in that Bible so once that Bible is in you you have we only have a son because we need this on earth because we learn read write architect ABC but you think you need this book in heaven we need scriptures on him and you become the very skepticism yet the words of the book you are something on earth you need to read the voice of one crying in the wilderness but haven't seen John [Music] John is the manifested wood of the voice of one Tanner wilderness so when God looked down John talk go are talking about jumbo when I translated in terms of this tiny lamenting voice of one kind of aloneness scripture Oh hallelujah God see you but we're not translated he said he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers who is he talking about whose heart is he talking about who are the tyrannies talking about you are you are actually in the scriptures but you have to come and awaken to that consciousness that you have a word that can still there look at all the Bible you are part of that Bible you are part of the world itself you are actually in the Bible you are the words of the book your name is in the book the preaching come to call your name [Applause] let me sees it so not what you see you can pin something on someone and say this is that and so forth but your life being different from what they seen your testimony of your life is louder than the testimony someone could see about you so people see about his reputation you know he saw he saw his reputation I know who you are we could think what do you wanna think about your reputation that's why you don't have a but about repetition I have a defend my reputation forget that Jesus even considers repetition of a repetition you want the life of Christ I don't be pristine a good name wouldn't have you cinnabar born in same we like all are we born in sin but you won't different no all have sinned and come short of the glory all all of us need the blood and the grace all of us need a messianic there's no need to be arrogant and proud and indifferent no there need to be subjection to this power as we get nearer we have to get more submissive to the will of God because we want to be guided by God all glory to God amen so keep that in mind we are brilliant we are bringing influences every day and the life that you live proves what's on the inside of you you cannot change it it reflects every person reflects outside what is inside and what we say in the reflection is the perfection if we read Christ is perfect isn't that right so he said you should be a walking by little you should be the walking wood of God you're with me mrs. read of all men or I translate that turn around this way you ibises that have been written read all a man manifested Word of God so Peter and John they were ignorant unlearn had no education but Hannah take notice that being with Jesus they were ignorant and unlearned but they were written epistles read that have been with Jesus here we go Jesus was manifesting himself through them cries failed in their flesh manifested made alive like he wasn't Moses so these men couldn't read the book of Revelation if they give them the book to read but they was revelation themselves or glory to God so then reading writing doesn't count when Christ is filled inside of you because he's the function of all knowledge and wisdom he's the function of these know this man I couldn't read them to Rascals come and touch land he said they lied to me they lied to the Holy Ghost there's a man who can't even read he can't even count what they're coming up and money or whatever it is but he know that the holy was revealed to him that they are lying or as the Holy Ghost a the languor because the Holy Ones can't lie cause that a man that would lie or get the Lord a show and that same Holy Ghost is coming back with discernment with signs and wonders and miracles what's all the protected Church give the Lord a show corner coming to judge people he come in to protect the church if it means judging people and cutting them off but to protect his people he's got to do it give me a scripture 1st Thessalonians 4 the Lord Himself descends from heaven with the show to get this bridle gonna let no man mess with this bride no way no way did the Lord our show didn't mess with your salvation he save you he told you he predestinated you and he's gonna fill you he's gonna see you he's going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire [Applause] maybe see that when you give your heart to the Lord who what man was inside idea what past about five minutes you who was married Saturday you come and give after Jesus and you say Lord I surrender my heart to you that was you and God somebody testify but something brick brick your heart that wasn't man do that man kept it no hat man do have the tools to break no heart Jesus in romantic um except my father draw or glory to God no man could come you can't come unless the Spirit of God come down to call you or get the Lord I scream that's why you should be praising God this morning to feel a little conviction to feel the presence of life coming up on your spirit [Applause] let me see those you may be you might be giants biscuit this morning but you could never be man the conviction of salvation that God called you the devil cannot make you deny that you only can tell when last you feel the power of God but you could always tell when God did something on your heart to say I want to repent of my sins you know that was not man you know that was God even upon your life give him praise for that this morning may be seated the church fields is on TEDx s main time I didn't call him on the books I'm quoting from I'm just coaching yourself priest become any cotton I can't preach accomplish I say what it tipsy the church feels that they don't need a Holy Spirit did you say well tell you that and men can stand up and give you such an intellectual talk can almost make you believe it not up stop in a minute then Jesus in a to spirit will be so close this is very like the intellectual talks would be so smooth it would deceive the people it is gospel it is men who can handle that word in such a way that would make any intellectual person if they are trust in the intellectuals they would condemn the Holy Spirit and take the way of man we see that he said the spirit of mine in Egypt you can see the persecution rise siege was have taken away in order that precision could rise a pharaoh have to raise upon you know Joseph one tool if I wrong favor grateful because you see if Egypt when Joseph's gone next Pharisee who is watch so droll they've taken away the order of position to rise then we see God which is real in the wheels everything more see part if I reject Joseph's lie told to live in prison be a good out excommunicated from his bedroom God put Joseph's and chill and he a big vision big revelation and God put him to chill in prison until he could get stripped of this self of this prison let's make a change a lot of things here you have a lot of limitations in precision you don't have the freedom and so you know you less think different when you come out of that you know and Joseph thinking you know what is this I supposed to be this and I supposed to be that and I am bride and I am Joseph and my father gave me special coat special coat man in prison but then when God ready God began to move oh it's not right watch something now and then God move there over sudden now how we can see the wheel and the wheels moving God great span moving everything up to this Exodus at this time wake a calls people back to the land again back to the police in position where he could bless them or butter over it you mean God can only bless you in position that's right you have to come into a position for God to bless you God want to bless you think about it what have you been hanging over your position right here now and you in a willingness spinner or around here watch it look at here I can't drop it out here look look a position here but you fighting God God your position is here if you want to open up a hole a heaven over you you want to bless you materially financially spiritually everywhere possible us out on that one did you hear

results the atmosphere swap with the difference but abandon walk into our meeting and slowly walk in the angel walking behind him and every purpose under commander wheelchair he said because of the atmosphere he didn't master preach you say if we get a seven on our minor in five minutes everybody in here wannabe he will be healed and five minutes everybody or one of the Holy Ghost could be filled with the Holy Ghost it all depends upon the atmosphere you are accurate or you could create the atmosphere what you think I'm doing behind here I am supposed to leave you in there a charge we are supposed to lead you in there is anointing or glory lead you into this power and there is anoying 10 I'm preaching out of the hole I am busting depressional for your frustration or for your demons are casting offer you the free from them no prayers demons or get a lot of shout in the house there are some demons called nor prayers demons they'll jump on Christians and seal them out [Music] but when they were in the upper room they were praising and blessing God continually because the Holy Ghost could only come down on the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that is why we worship that's why we sing that will be priests oh my god oh my hallelujah Oh glory let me see so let's look at something again in the word voice of one crown the wilderness in God's mine that Scripture is a man his name's up the Baptist in the word a virgin shall conceive but in God's thinking that's Mary so we see Scripture go see a person in the world have mysteries but Christ is the mystery of God revealed so when that mystery is converted it has to be converted into a life some people make fun of evangelists because - evangelists get me senator come to the Lord and what Larry teacher positionally please deliver into what position the in and you profit do this on impossible and so on so they have a kind of I think like evangelist for the mind the teacher is the place the person's positionally forward so all this teaching preaching instructing have an endgame behind them and that purpose is ready to receive Christ for you to be formatted with image not to say well you are well educated or well knowledgeable it's the form Christ in you because the master teacher was Jesus right he opened it understand to the scriptures and he opened the word to them guys and when he finished with her me send them onto a purpose they'll knew their position they knew what that was to do they were placed in the upper room they created atmosphere and they waited until they cried out until they asked until they stayed until what was promised was fulfilled when it was fulfilled the commander said this is that this scripture here this here is that doctor was talking about it's manifested it's fulfilled it's confirmed it's vindicated but the same thing has to happen we have to say this is that that the Prophet William branham's because it's vindicated it's fulfilled it's confirmed [Applause] Oh give a lot of shout oh my the life that was in the stock just official Miller with a sonification something hear me away for the bathroom Holy Ghost and the baptismal egos atmosphere spirit birds made away for the Holy Ghost itself to come down in perfection and back to the word so God was waiting for the atmosphere to come that he himself come down in that right oh praise the Lord so he was the Living Word he was the word he was the Living Word and the Living Word comes into us then it does have the same effect on us because it is the same word it's the same thing that's among us he come to brand listen he come to breed back Adam Trese this is good are you ready you want some juice I was like a little like like this course menu let's get some ham slices you know he come to breed back to Aaron's race a living fit in the Living Word of the Living God and he proved right by his action that the weakest st. on earth can beat the devil upon the written word of God we don't have enough events on that I hands empty 5% we talk money we can say it like all your eggs strong inside of here or glory to God he said a weaker Saint could beat that devil on the Ricky word come on we want some demon busters demon jesters come on come on come on [Applause] watch watch he was God himself manifested in flesh had powers without a limit and he never used them what did he do he defeated Satan on the same thing that's it and if he's even he pulled wool over him at that time when he whitewashed the water I've got to Eve she believed it isn't that right and watch he stayed with the wood and so on like that so the devil he is written as written written is not right so you have got to get the living wood in you to have the Living God in you because the word here is God aha here we go when it has made flesh in you let's go deeper the word here is God when it's made flesh in you made spirit and life in you when it goes into your flesh and your feet and becomes life then you become a living example it has to come in your feet on your flesh your first feet is what mental feet is just here then drop down here the flesh yet afterwards it becomes part of you you just in this thing you can't help it or glory the God is part of you or glory that God in my you ie pistol of God read of all men you won't have it like Christ not in the fullness because it was divided up under their Pentecost you are God's living word representatively earth continue to work the church ought to be that way so he was God's Word made manifest oh how I like to get into that God will be manifest in other words made known uh-huh he was God's Word made manifest or made known God's Word made known in other words he was the one that God living to make his word known Christ expressed what the word talked ah we get into something now all this wood and spook when books on what not when I said I wrap up and become flesh all them spoken word books the bride would be an expression of that [Applause] that is why but a Branham says he said that is why the full revelation is the bride wouldn't Madison in Jesus name because Jesus gonna be in that bright that they were gonna shut the Pentecostals because you were say rise up whoa he'll Brian see Garrity because Jesus name will be in you [Applause] [Music] so when you speak you already speaking in Jesus name because yes name already in you said ever cast out that leave leave now when Jesus when Jesus was coming up the mountain disciples cast no special Castle spoon commode ever come whenever I'm butter I'm traumatized it never was telling let me still

pressure we cry out I'm gonna wrap up I could spend two hours more I have 12 of the 41 pages so we don't get far today but I want you to get sittin things he said no we are coming to this great hidden mystery I've been since the foundation of the world no been revealed as these to the sons of God you believe that the true sons are to be manifested waiting for the manifestation sons of God what is manifestation making known now a lot of preachers spring this as making known mysteries and which is also good but I want to bring it a different way today making known is easy making known the trumpets divides the plays one in his son the Hebrew 144,000 are different mysteries and so on but listen to this part from indictment barabara he was the Living Word of God because he was expressing God through himself he was so completely surrendered to the Word of God till he and the wood was the same that is exactly what the church ought to be today that the Word of God is the same know today that did if I'm forthwith the man was the world the phone for Twitter man was the word know they find fault with the word work and to the man or glory to God so this making known is also making the word manifested this maker known is not just develop information or revelation or explanation is making known means Christ becoming manifested do you want to see that then cry for that I want to see Jesus I want to see christ manifested I come for my healing I come for my deliverance God hallelujah oh my my my what we need a revelation of the Spirit oh I'll just keep that I'll just come quickly now the gospel doesn't consist of wood only but to the power and that manifests in the Holy Spirit cause that's the only way it could be done for these signs to follow them that we believe so it would have to be the Holy Spirit that would give life to produce these signs the gospel is good news to every creature how long will it last on to the end of the world isn't that right no the Bible no what is the gospel what is the gospel the gospel is the good news all right but the Bible is the letter are you ready let's go the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so Paul said the gospel come not you only but you the power and manifestation of the Holy Spirit now notice the only way that the gospel could be preached then would be to manifest the power of the Holy Spirit so we have to come up to the gospel the word is like the seed of the gospel it's a big statement let's get it these signs of honor I believe then strictly speaking a man kind of qualify himself as a believer until all this has happened so no church can rightly call himself I believe in church until these signs follow them that's what Jesus said it's making the word manifest so the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operation and the children had a seat at the chair of the kingdom the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operate and to his children is those seeds of the kingdom the word is of course that we know but he's bringing it back the word was invisible listen close the world was invisible on t little made flesh then the would become visible we all want to see Jesus that means the would have to become flesh then when they will become flush we can see it we can handle it we can touch it Oh glory to God hallelujah I have often want to come into a church I've longed to see it I guess when I could walk to the back door front door whatever it was look across the audience and see a perfect Church all in order sin couldn't steal the spirit we'll call it out oh praise the name of the Lord oh my oh my he's talking about a man who could crack glass of water mental conception and a human spirit perverted a damned spirit because you were fashioned in the image of God what would you do if you let God
