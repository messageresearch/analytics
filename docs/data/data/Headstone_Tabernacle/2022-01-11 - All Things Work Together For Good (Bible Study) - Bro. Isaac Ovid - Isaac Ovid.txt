heads forward of prayer almighty god we thank you tonight for your love for your grace for your mercy for your compassion for your faithfulness for your promises for your word lord that is keeping us

lord gathering around your word your eternal word that gives us access to eternity father we thank you for today we thank you for life held for strength for being able to be here despite lord the so many obstacles and challenges we would have encountered today father we have still made it our business to be law accounted among them who have responded to this great call this call to perfection the call to the rapture the call to the resurrection lord and this study tonight lord is all part of that great divine plan lord to see further how we prioritize our time and how we could balance lord this this this this life of this balancing act lord of the commitments to family and to work and to school and to various obligations lord where you have instructed us to put you first so we report for duty tonight with that deep understanding that if we take care of your business father just as jesus had to be about his father's business that lord if we take care of your business father that you would get involved in our affairs and tonight father we give you permission lord as the prophet preached doors and doors he challenged us to open the doors of our homes our hearts our lives and to give you free reign lord to walk anywhere to touch anything to have an input and influence on every aspect of our lives so tonight we surrender our will to you we surrender our thoughts our ideas our feelings lord our challenges he's said to cast all our cares upon you so we come tonight to cast our cares upon you lord this may feel like a different setting because we are not physically in church and it might be a zoom meeting by law we thank you that you're a god of faith and that lord we serve a god of miracles we serve a god that is not limited by time or distance or technology father but we pray dear god that in this room where we could agree where two shall agree touching anything father we have many needs in the church tonight many people who lord are struggling physically lord the virus different conditions different situations we unite and fit for our brothers and sisters father that the healing rain lord will pour upon them that even as this bible study unfolds lord father healing would break forth father lord we don't know who's here tonight and who may join us along this journey for these few moments but father if there's someone who's desiring more of you may you speak to them may you give us courage and confidence through your word boldness lord to walk into your presence father may you lift our countenance and help us to square our shoulders back there's so much against us but it's also so much for us and value taught us that they are more for us than against us so our faith rests upon you tonight may you take me out of the way and encourage your people may you bless your people we thank you for our pastor tonight we thank you for the ministry we thank you for the believers who are here father we thank you for the visitors that may be among us we commit this bible study into your hands father and maybe all for your honor and for your glory in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen amen so certainly uh take yourself you know welcome one and all to our first uh bible study of 2022 and um it is like the first day of school uh we are we are opening back um bible study and our time together in this informal setting to encourage us to inspire us and um and as we walk this journey of 2022 and all of the challenges and opportunities and hills and valleys that we have to navigate that we can do so with a spiritual mind a spiritual focus a spiritual understanding and with greater wisdom than 2020 and 2021 and 2022 as we are here in this year we are challenged and encouraged that there's a great responsibility upon us because if you are here tonight it's because god still has a plan and a purpose for your life you know we are taught through the word that when god is finished with somebody he he can rest them down and give them that rest but if you are here it's because there's a purpose for your life so we want to embrace that purpose walk in that purpose understand that purpose and to be effective in our purpose so tonight it's somewhat of a introductory teaching it's a familiar body of scripture we're going to look at tonight but i want to really slow down um a bit on it tonight um and maybe in driving slowly as we have said in bible studies you know along familiar territory we may see things that we never really saw before so once again welcome to one and all and if you have your bibles it's bible study but we are going to be in romans 8 tonight a very familiar scripture um but i'm excited tonight about what god is about to do for us so romans chapter 8 tonight and i have a title for the study and sometimes i give it to the beginning sometimes i give it to the end sometimes um you know we do different things but i want to call it all things work together for good bible study and really a study of romans 8. i don't know if the lord will allow us to get down to romans 8 28 but we actually want to start from romans 8 plus 1 and drive along this road so buckle your seat belts in get in the spirit separate itself from all distractions because i believe in my heart that what we are going to discuss tonight have a conversation around um can help push somebody closer to their understanding of what their expectations should be and by the way i want to salute god with a message on sunday by one's spirit we are baptized into one body and i'm connecting into that with this bible study as well to go you know along this this this line that we are on as well through his word so romans 8 and we know this is paul's letter to the romans and scattered through this book of romans it is a very i would call it a very complex book because paul says a lot um you know as you go through romans um he unfolds quite a number of things and you can miss it if you don't take your time and really look at it so paul as we know would have written letters to the various churches and to the church in rome would have been a very specific type of audience because although it is written you know to the romans um he would have referenced those that really understood the law that they understood what he was speaking about and we may get to that but let's start from romans 8 1 and it starts really interesting he said there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit i want to rewind this verse a little bit he said there is therefore now in mathematics therefore comes after you have done some good things and you are coming to a conclusion so paul is introducing romans 8. and he is actually basing it on arguments he would have made before so when you come to a halt or slow down he said there is therefore so in other words as a result of what i have said before in the amplified it actually says therefore there is now so in other words you can't even drive beyond romans 8 1 without trying to understand what were the points or the arguments that paul made before romans 8 to where he's trying to go now i trust everybody is with me so he said there is therefore in other words as a result of certain things i've said before there is therefore now no condemnation so the first thing that paul is addressing is as a result of what i've said before there is now no condemnation so then you need to draw now to these key words no condemnation now this word condemnation that is found in romans 8 1 paul only uses this word condemnation six times in all of the letters he uses this once when he is speaking to timothy but it was not addressing this issue of condemnation paul would use the word condemnation twice to the corinthians but he was not addressing this type of condemnation it is only in the book of romans and in only two specific chapters he is addressing the issue of condemnation so he is laying a foundation a powerful foundation for believers in romans 8 1 by saying there is therefore so as a result of what have said before as a result of what i presented before there is now no condemnation and he addressed condemnation in romans 5 where he said in romans 5 16 and 5 18 and for bible scholars would remember this reference so romans 5 16 says and not as it was by one that sin the so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses under justification so in romans 5 is where paul was speaking about by by one man's sin all right and by and bringing that type there so he was he was bringing it there but i wanted to see to see something interesting here as well basically paul in romans 5 16 was also given a clear definition by contrast of what he was speaking about with condemnation so i want to read it again to bring the contrast he said not as it was by one that sin so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation so the judgment was the one by condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification so paul in romans 5 16 was making a comparison between two things that's really what he was doing there between condemnation and justification anybody with me all right so in other words for paul's argument the opposite of condemnation is justified the opposite of guilty is never did it not not guilty and that itself is powerful so the opposite for paul because justified is as he can never did it in the first place so paul was making a point here that condemnation the real opposite of condemnation in his spiritual sense is justification not just our not guilty verdict but you never do it in the first place all right so the other point is romans 5 18 where he says therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life so paul repeats it again that the opposite of condemnation is justification so now let's take it back into romans 8 1. in other words another way to say this because paul only used the word condemnation in a limited context but here is it again there is therefore now this could also be said as there is therefore now justification because he's bringing the contrast or you can say there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus just within this first verse and we could spend 20 minutes in this first verse it doesn't say those who are in church it doesn't say those who are in the message it doesn't say those who are even in the faith it says in christ jesus so i was trying to think about a way to present this that we can kind of see what paul is talking about here you know and i was looking at it like this if you are in your house there are certain things you can do there's certain benefits you could access if you are in your office so for example you might have faster internet speed in your office than in your home anybody with me so because you are in your office your access to do certain things might be greater than when you are in your home it sounds simple but i want us to really understand this in christ jesus thing because a lot of people don't understand what in christ jesus is because they are in church but they're not in christ jesus they're in the message but they're not in christ jesus they might believe but they're not in christ jesus but paul is also qualifying what his research is referring to if you are in the park or you're in the country you might have different cell phone reception and if you're in the city where you are in has an impact on what you could access can i say that one more time where you are has an impact on what you could access so paul is saying there's therefore as a result of what i've said before now now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit in the amplified it says therefore there is now no condemnation no guilty verdict no punishment for those who are in christ jesus who believe in him as personal lord and savior and then verse two for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death now we read this many times but i want to slow down again because paul is highlighting there are two laws that are at work and these two laws need to be satisfied because every law needs to be satisfied so let's take it for the law of the spirit of life in christ so there's a law of the spirit hallelujah and there's a law of sin and death the law of sin and death we understood as moses law or the mosaic law and paul in the book of romans would have spent a lot of time talking about the the issues around the law but he's saying for the law of the spirit of life you know in other words this this new law because they cannot operate outside of law so there there's always a law so we're not dealing with legalism versus not having a law it is a different kind of law so is the law of moses which was rules and do's and don'ts so a different kind of law for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus had made me free so this is not a law to trap you or to keep you in chains this is the law that gives you access to freedom in fact it has made me free from the law of sin and debt in the amplified we're building into something don't worry for the law of the spirit of life which is in christ jesus the law of our new being has set you free from the law of sin and of death and we have to appreciate and understand that the law that we're talking about could not have brought change in our behavior and if we could appreciate this tonight this is why being born again is so important this is why by one spirit being baptized into the body is so important because the law as paul said only with highlights would only make to your knowledge what you're doing wrong anybody with me for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus had made me free from the law of sin and that verse 3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh and i was thinking even within the context of what we have become used to in in our day now the law says put on a mask but the law in and of itself has no power to make you do it in them law is written the law is announced in isolation the law has no power to actually enforce without enforcement the law is almost it has no real value unless you take the law and apply it to you the law itself is weak anybody with me because the law is outside of us but when the enforcement and is the fear of enforcement that makes a law severe or not severe so that is why a law now could be ticketable or there are no consequences because if the law has no consequence most people when you see the law you'll feel like what that had no impact on me many people that's why they're driving and the mass don't women see the poor police why why don't leave the mass down but is when you see the enforcement of the law it suddenly makes the law seem more powerful because you know that when of enforcement connects with the law is a different situation so paul is saying here for what the law could not do in other words for years the law was there it's not that the law was not there the law was there saying what you could do what you could not do how to live how to live and and how to adjust your life it was there it was not that it was not there but the law was weak because no matter how much knowledge you had of the law there was no power in the law to really change your behavior the law was always going to require enforcement the law was always going to create a situation that you're going to never live up to the law because the requirements of the law was set in such a way that it would only highlight what your issues were but not provide a solution to bring you into compliance with the law anybody with me to say it the way paul said it paul said in in romans 7 7 what shall we say then is the lost sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law in other words if it wasn't for the law i would not have even known that i was in sin anybody hear me my is my connection working it's fine okay so paul is saying if it was not for the law i would not have even known for paul saying in romans 7 7 for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet so paul is saying it was law that made me aware of my condition and the law that also made me aware of my condition created guilt created shame but did not provide a solution as much as i tried to meet the requirement of the law the law could not give me a solution so this is what makes the law weak and i want this to help believe us tonight because if you only look at the law of moses and the rules and trying to match the law the letter of the law without the spirit you will find yourself in this cycle of trying to figure out why you're not living a certain kind of a life so paul here in romans is introducing the critical importance not of abandoning the law but of a higher law that required his spirit now because the law that was the law of moses which was an external law was being superseded by another law which is driven by the spirit he call it the law of the spirit because when you're living by the law of the spirit it is no longer a weak law that's trying to get you to conform to the law but it's not the spirit in the driver's seat changing your behavior so it's not forcing you as a believer to meet a standard that seems impossible it is the spirit living its natural way oh come on now anybody with me so it is not trying to fit a a a a shape into another shape and and you're shining and you're stretching you you're trying to drag yourself to live a certain way and and fight delivery to me it's not that anymore because under the law of sin and debt you could do your very best and your very best quite honestly is not enough because the law had no power to give you strength to overcome but this new law we're talking about call the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus once again in christ jesus is the only place this law begins to apply i want us to get this tonight it is only in christ jesus this law begins applying are you in christ jesus tonight are you swimming are you are you inside this thing fully this is not a message to people who who half within and who not sure and who not trying this is people who want to dive deep and and you really want to get all of this i'm not talking about church tonight and i even talk about belief i'm talking about in christ jesus because the more you go in him all of your natural desires begin to fear and paul goes into that because he's building up this argument to get her somewhere anybody with me let's go for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and forcing condemning in the flesh i want us to take that slowly because this is important we've read it what between but i wanted to get it in the amplified it says for what the law could not do that is and listen to what the amplifier says is that is overcome sin and remove its penalty its power so the law was telling you what you should be and what you should live and what you could not do and should do but the law could not give you the ability to actually overcome sin the law was only telling you what to do and not do do this don't do this do this don't do this but you were coming to church trying to figure out how do i overcome how do i live how do i do what i'm supposed to do and how do i not do what i'm not supposed to do anybody with me so the law could not help you to overcome sin and remove its penalty its power being weakened by the flesh because you were born in sin shape and iniquity this law was actually never you were never going to be able to overcome this this mosaic law in your natural flesh condition it is impossible that is why outside of the holy ghost there's no way you could ever live a perfect life oh come on now i hope i hope i hope this this starter resonates outside the holy ghost you could go and live in a mountain for years and not watch no tv no phone nothing at all the moment you come out of the sterile environment the law of sin and debt meets the flesh and all of a sudden you see the gap between your flesh and the law of sin and death because god didn't want it to ever be by your ability in this flesh to meet a higher law but what the law could not do that is overcome sin and remove its penalty its power being weakened by the flesh and listen in the amplified man's nature without the holy spirit if this does set anybody free with understanding the critical importance because the difference between the law of mosaic the mosaic law or the law of sin and that and the law of the spirit of life is only one distinction you know one is no spirit involved and the other you live in by the spirit and once you're living by the spirit this natural law of sin and death you it's under your feet because you have been caught up in a higher law because you are in christ is there anybody struggling to overcome then this is the message for you because it should create such a desire in you for the holy ghost a desire in you for a new walk a new life anybody with me tonight listen so again we still in verse 3 for what the law could not do paul is making it clear no matter how much books you read how much tapes you listen to how much you know the law how much you understand the law how much you believe the law how much you receive the law how much you know how to dress how to speak how to live the law and what defines the law there will always be a gap that could never be met because the law itself is weak to give you the ability to live a holy life holiness cannot be legislated holiness cannot be by rules and regulations young people caleb's get this holiness could never be by the law the law does not have the ability to bring you into a level of compliance with god but god didn't leave us just with the law of sin and death by the law of the spirit of life which can only come by the holy ghost you have accessed in christ to a higher power that is no longer about rules and regulations and do's and don'ts but the nature of christ because you are in christ living his life out of you it is not difficult when you are in christ and in the holy ghost to live a holy life because it's christ living out of you this is why friends it is impossible for somebody to tell me they have the holy ghost or they are adopted or they have the spirit and they cannot live a holy life because the holy ghost will make you live a holy life that's why brother branham said that's what the holy ghost is given for anybody with me so you can lay along rules in the church the law is limited it brings you to knowledge you didn't know it was wrong you didn't know he was in sin that's what the law does it highlights it and paul said it in romans 7 he said i didn't know until the law came i didn't even know what my issue was so the law comes a highlighted issue and it brings you to repentance but repentance is still not the spirit oh come on now coming into your life you can repent every day and it is a requirement to repent but it is still different when the spirit comes into your life are still in verse 3 this is romans 8 that we have read hundreds of times right for what the law could not do so it is impossible this is why legalism young people in church for years and the moment they get to exit a hatch and i preach this before you take the pig you lock the pig in the house you close the door you close the window the pig with no access to mud has no mud to go and play with the pig suddenly becomes domesticated you put cologne on the pig you put a few monday pig you bear the pig you put deodorant on the pig you put on your pants you put in a suit you put in a tie you give him a spoken word book you give him a bible you carry him to bible study he will behave he will shout he will jump because he in the environment but the day you'll leave the door open and the pigs see the mud outside he is dropping the bible dropping this word book because you kept him living under the law of sin and death unless that pig is changed to alarm oh god somebody help me tonight unless that pig has a change of nature and now accepts the existence and the power of a higher law all you can do is lock him up in legislation that can never work anybody with me tonight i don't know if this helping somebody but if this doesn't give you a hunger for lord i want the holy ghost lord i want a spiritual experience lord i know the books i know the tips i know the law i know the expectation i know the standard because brother branham taught us his standard a perfect church a truth without spot and wrinkle that is clear that is clear there's no compromise to that we're not going anywhere less than that but there has to be a way to get there and there's only one way that is by the holy ghost can the church say amen are still in verse 3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh in other words likeness is the difference between jesus and us likeness of sinful flesh so like us in that he looking like sinful flesh dressing like sinful flesh feeling the exhaustion of sinful flesh feeling the emotional stress and turmoil like when lazarus died the sinful flesh the tiredness in the boat but i like how the amplified says it for what the law could not do that is overcome sin and remove its penalty its power being weakened by the flesh man's nature without the holy spirit god did that's what i'm gonna say god did it in other words god provide the solution it is not my solution it is not your solution he himself because listen friends i love to say this god is limited by his own law my so god cannot lie because he his own law there's some things god could do everything yes but there's some things god cannot do he cannot lie and god cannot come back on his own word that's why when he speaks a word over your life he can't even take the word back or you don't hear me tonight when god bless you he kind of unduty blessing because already spoken when the arrow of blessing the arrow of deliverance leaves and heads to your house god can't even stop it that is that's the kind of god we serve so when god said the law required payment the law of sin and death required sin and death god said the only way i could give them a chance in 2022 is to close the loop on the old law to open the door to the new law so the first law had to be satisfied so god looked for a way to satisfy the first law of sin and debt and send his own son in the likeness of sin oh come on now and say i have the answer god created law and he closed the loop on his own law because if he didn't close the loop you don't have a chance i don't have a chance you see why you're supposed to be bold and confident to go to ask god for what you need tonight because god wants you to come to him he wants you to ask him he wants to heal you he wants to fill you he wants to give you the holy ghost he wants to open your understanding he wants you to live a victorious life and he didn't leave it up to you to figure it out he said i have a law here that requires sin and death so i'm going to send my own son hallelujah in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin that's his purpose to deal with sin but this is what happened in the amplified well in the king james it says condemn sin in the flesh and he amplified it says it he sent his own son in the likeness of sinful man as an offering for sin and he this man called jesus did what no other man before had ever done he condemned sin in the flesh moses couldn't do it abraham couldn't do it elijah couldn't do it in the amplified it says jesus he subdued it and overcame it in the person of his own son in other words god sent a representative to take blame and that a representative would take blame subdued it this thing called sin and overcame it bring sin into captivity bring sin into subjection bring sin under control tell sin where to get off tell sin he had no power that he could walk the earth in the likeness of sinful flesh and not give into temptation not given to doubt not given to lust not given to pornography not given to lying not given to oh come on now the lust of the eye the lust of the flesh and the bible said he was tempted just as we are tempted but did not sin he told sin a lesson he told sin listen i don't have to bend to you come on now and he was not doing that for himself he was doing that to release another law a lot in other words god knew that because the law had no power or the reverse of that you had no power to meet the requirement of the law or the law or the power of the law was ineffective to change you he had to bring another type of law that could give you power to meet the requirements of the law anybody with me is this helping anybody is this i know he's not a character we only hear but right now i'm not on our bible character i'm on you as the character you being changed from the law of sin and death that sin and death have no power over you do you know you could walk over sin and walk over that and look at him and look at that no wonder paul could say hey death where's your sting grave where's your victory because he was walking in this spirit he was in christ he was fully confident fully persuaded we're still there so are still in verse three and verse three ends with a colon which means what comes after is related to verse 3. so verse 4 is dependent on verse 3 so it is basically saying that god did this for a purpose and it tells you what the purpose is that the righteousness of the law hallelujah this impossible righteousness the requirement of being righteous concerning the law which could have never been fulfilled under the old structure of the law was now made possible because of what god did through christ no wonder poor can say there is therefore now no condemnation verse 4 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit all right i want to read that in the amplified so that the righteous and just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us in other words god's law still has a requirement to know but god now made it possible truly holy spirit for us to live to the standard of the law in other words you don't need police to keep you in line no more you you you you don't need that anymore you just find yourself in line because the police move from the outside to the inside or you you don't hear me you don't have to wait most most people their behavior change when they see enforcement or somebody and and all of a sudden the external presence of something makes you line up god wanted to move it from the outside to the police on being on the outside but he pulled it's been on the inside so the governance is now on the inside so so you don't have no problem to live a holy life because the police on the inside anybody with me so let's go first five for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh what are you after tonight but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit in the amplified for those who are living according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh which gratify the body but those who are living according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit his will and purpose that's why we are here tonight we want to be connected to his will and his purpose we have plenty other things we could be doing there are people tonight who have no excuse for not being here what are they focused on what's the rare reason the separation of bride and fullest version and why virgin is not it's not me separating it's not is is your behavior is your conduct is your preparation is your attitude it's your approach so paul is saying here for they that are after the flesh do mind the things that of the flesh but they that are after these pretty things of the spirit verse six for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace could somebody describe you as spiritually minded do you make decisions that are that are that are that are in alignment with somebody who is spiritually minded or is it carnally minded in the amplified it says now the mind of the flesh is death both now and forever because it pursues sin but the mind of the spirit is life and peace the spiritual well-being that comes from walking with god both now and forever what's the subject of your conversation you hear people say hey he real carnal boy what does that mean somebody cannot it means their conversation is down a road that has a certain slant a certain tendency that they like it yeah you have people when you talk with them even though they talk about spiritual things they get quiet quite quiet but they start to talk about the politics and talk about this and talk about that all of a sudden you see them light up they're excited because that is what they are tuned to their mind they they everything is exciting but they say well but let me talk about the lord until there's a it's a whole different behavior what don't you understand god is looking at that and paul is making is making it very very very clear right verse 8 so then they that in are in the flesh cannot please god in the amplified that says and those who are in the flesh listen to what it means living a life that caters to sinful appetites and impulses cannot please god where do you stand tonight are you living a life to please god we still in romans eight tonight this is still the same chapter where all things work together for good we're building up to that we'll get we'll rejoice in that part but we're talking about there's a journey to get there and that journey is that separation between the carnal flesh struggling to live to the lord kind of man and the man who has been converted by the spirit by the holy ghost to live under a new law that now becomes easy to live so people can't understand how you're making it anybody with me let's go but ye are not in the flesh so this is now paul encouraging them now so challenging them now ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you dwell in you in you this thing need to be in you again if you don't have the holy ghost tonight what are you doing about it can you say the holy ghost can you hear about all this message sunday a little bit red certain powerful quotes about there's a difference between a christian and a holy ghost failed christian nobody questioning if you're a christian nobody questioning if you love your lord nobody questioning if you believe the message but are you a holy ghost filled christian is the holy ghost pulsating in your soul is the police inside your heart or the police outside if when they see your brother or sister on the street you're fixing your clothes and and you're fixing this and fixing that it comes in that brush is the police in them because the control tower are not on the inside oh don't make me don't don't make me don't maybe come to your homes tonight come and take everybody home at the same time if you have to change your music when a believer is around you then it means the police not on the inside the police clearly on the outside if you have to change your conversation when somebody else comes around anybody with me then it'd be the police on the outside and not on the inside we have to be able to live a holy life when nobody else is watching and that only comes from the holy ghost anybody with me who's 10 are you hearing me tonight yes we're here in isaac and if christ be in you again it is not you having a kind of relationship but if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit of life is the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him and rays of jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwell it in you and friends this here is so powerful because this closes the gap in this time when people don't know where they're standing and gross darkness and death talk in the land it is so important to know that the spirit of god is in you because if it is this mortal body have to fall with this mortal body need to follow the spirit because if the spirit is in you then this spirit shall quicken the mortal body by the spirit that dwell in you so the real christian the holy ghost christian doesn't fear death tonight can i say that one more time the holy ghost feel christian don't fear that because the holy ghost christian understand that if your spirit is in you that spirit will quicken this mortal body so paul is building a powerful this whole everything you read so far is about the importance of the holy ghost and how desperate we ought to be to make sure we can live this thing therefore bridging we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die and that die is not going on that's real death separation from god but if you or ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live and be going into familiar territory i'm not going to be too much longer with you for as many as are led by the spirit of god we know this they are the sons of god hallelujah for all and listen to this amplified for all who are allowing themselves to be led by the spirit of god so this for as many as are led is just beyond seeing many let alone but allowing the spirit to lead them not allowing because being led sheep are meant to be led people allowing the neighbor the boss the friend somebody else to lead them into all kind of places are you allowing the spirit to lead you if you're supposed to be in bible time tonight and you find yourself doing something else who lead and who who leading you you've got the spirit supposed to lead you to closer to god to one to have your walk your your thinking your behavior your motive your objective in the right place right for as many as and i love how the amplified positions it for all who are allowing themselves to be led by the spirit of god not hollywood not the news not netflix not movies not well because other people are doing it i can do that they are allowing themselves to be led by the spirit of god i want to nail her down and um because when people behave a certain kind of way that is not christ like something else is leading them the reason paul have to make this statement is to clarify who the sons of god are we have read the scripture many times but paul is saying for as many in other words only the ones who allow themselves to be led by the spirit of god they're not moving because of the group they're not moving because of people they're being led by the spirit of god who is leading you tonight who is leading you in your decision-making are you seeking the spirit of god are you looking for god to guide your decisions or are you leaning on are you leading yourself where are you getting advice and counsel from we are the beginning of a new year and we are challenging ourselves to be sensitive to the holy spirit not our ideas our ideas we get us in trouble our feelings get in trouble are we emotionally in trouble for we have not received you know this the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father for you have not received a spirit so bear in mind now the context of this because all along we're talking about the law of sin and of death we talk about the spirit of life and this new spirit and this here is in the context of everything paul is saying so he's now making clarity and distinction about this spirit that you're receiving the spirit that you're getting here that we're talking about here is not a spirit of bondage again to fear the spirit you're getting little and listening to the in the amplified it says for you have not received a spirit of slavery leading again to fear of god's judgment in other words the spirit is not about fear in god's judgment but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons which is the spirit in the amplified producing sonship so the production of sonship is only by the spirit not by how much years any message or how much books you read or even your understanding of the word and the unfolding of the mystery that is not producing sons what is distinguishing sons from everybody else is being led by the spirit and the spirit actually producing sons for he has not received a spirit of bunnies again to fear but he have received his spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father verse 16 the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirits that we are children of god oh i love that the spirit himself listens to the amplified testifies and confirms together with our spirit that we believers are children of god in other words the spirit in you has a voice that is in alignment with your own declaration that you are son of god anybody here tonight believe their son or daughter of god we have to believe it we have to claim it we have to say it so not only does god want us to declare that we are sons and daughters of god and but the spirit itself will also join your voice oh come on now and say yes this is the sun so it's not just you declaring i'm a son but a spirit itself will be a witness that you are a son so god has a double entry confirmation system so you and the spirit will be saying the same thing that your son anybody with me oh my if that doesn't give you confidence and assurance because listen you could be questioning yourself and wondering but the spirit itself brings and listen listen to the amplified this here is gold listen carefully here the spirit himself testifies and confirms together with our spirit listen in the original translation assuring us that we believe as a children of god so you might be there tonight saying boy i listen to this thing and i wonder if i'm gonna make it i wonder if i'm a son i'm a son and i'm a son and you're there holding on hoping that at somehow this thing could ring true and the bible is saying paul is saying the spirit will confirm give you assurance give you confirmation because god knows sometimes you wonder sometimes you're there you're upside down story of our loop but his spirit is also testifying yes this this is a son yes you are overcomer yes he victorious oh come on now so so when that spirit in you begin to cry out and you also crying out that is service confirmation that makes you walk with even more confident somebody say amen the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of god and if children then is heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may all be also glorified together let's read that one more time if children then is so heirs mean you have an inheritance heirs of god joined heirs with christ which means you're sharing the inheritance with christ but there's a condition to this if so be that we suffer with him is is anybody willing to suffer sharing in his suffering that we could also reign that you're not looking at the are the suffering as a problem you're not afraid when things go wrong you're not afraid to be any reproach of the word you're not bothered with issues in your life when things happen because all this is part of it because you know you have an inheritance that you'll be also glorified and your suffering entitles you to glorification if so be that he's suffering with him that so that that says after his suffering or because of his suffering it opens even though that we may also be also glorified together verse for i reckon i love this i reckon in the amplified for i consider from the standpoint of fate that the sufferings of this present time and if this scripture was ever relevant yesterday i reckon that the sufferings of this present time 2020 2021 2022 are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us now this alone is a reason to shout because it's like a glory being revealed it's almost like i want you to see like a gift wrapped up and the gift paper coming off and you didn't know what was inside of you oh come on now so there's a revelation about a glory that's in you that only the suffering will highlight the glory because the glory is being compared to the suffering oh oh my hold on hold on let me let me slow down after for i reckon that his sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory so paul is comparing the sufferings and the issues and the challenges he said when awaits when away the sufferings and away with the revealing of the glory because to reveal something means it was hidden to reveal something means it was there and it was not known that it was there so there's a glory that god has to reveal in you it is not outside of you it's in you oh come on now anybody feeling to shout a little bit [Music] verse let's go on verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god we know this in this one roman state his promise is the world is the world scroll here you know adoption manifestation spirit the old law calvary everything is locked up in this one personal for the earnest expectation of the creature for the evil in the amplified even the whole creation all nature waits eagerly listen for the amplified for the children of god to be revealed in other words it's as if there's there's a masking that's taking place people in all these are not dealing with outside the bride dealing with churches are they dealing with people who in this room there's a revelation happening there's a revealing happening there's an uncovering happening there's an unveiling people come into church and there's three kinds of believers but it will come a period a time of revealing and that is what the earnest expectation of the creature waiting for the manifestation or the revealing the uncovering the unfolding the pulling back the veil of who you really are that god dropped you in 2022 to be an adopted son to be a positionally played son and the devil doesn't know it the person next to you in church don't even know who you are oh come on now you don't hear me tonight there are some hidden ones here tonight whatever i'm saying third person with the weaker ones but eventually when they get over there you're gonna see people who you you couldn't believe they make it oh come on now all of this part of the revealing that the whole creation waiting on to reveal those who look like they don't have a chance that they can make it to reveal those who drag themselves to bible study there wasn't really any feeling this evening but it dragged itself to connect the night all of that is being revealed because that you revealing yourself it's god has to do the revealing because he is the interpreter of his own word oh you don't hear me tonight for the creature verse 20 was made subject of vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope listen four listen to what this means friends for the creation was subjected to frustration and futility not willingly because of some intentional fault of its part in other words god is saying everything we're going through the frustration the futility things are looking like it working on behalf of nature everything not because of an intentional thought on its path adam didn't set out to sin adam didn't set out to fall adam didn't plan to sin adam didn't plan to fall but by the will of him who subjected it in hope that the creation will also be freed from its bondage so your frustration is not by your design oh let me let me say that again your frustration is not your fault but god allowed all these things to bring certain things up because the creator itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption the corruption of sin the corruption of death into the glorious liberty of the sons of god verse 22 for we know that the whole creation groan it and travail it in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope i want to pause there for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope i want to read that one more time for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for who hopes for what he already sees doesn't need any amplified in other words we are saved by hope but the hope that is seen is not really hope for what a man see it why what he had hoped for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patients wait for it so our hope is in what we do not see and that speaks to your fate as a believer knowing your change is coming knowing your promise is about to happen knowing your children will be delivered knowing you're going to get the holy ghost knowing you're going to make it knowing it's locked up inside of you to be revealed knowing that the sufferings of this present time is all about revealing the glory in you and you have a hope and expectation something wake it up this morning it will awaken by the grace of god tomorrow it will wake you up by the grace of god the next day it's a hope we have a hope that this body can be changed we have a hope that is grey here the bald head could be changed we have a hope that he had the art rightists and the high blood pressure and the female condition and the financial problems and the marriage issues and the family issues we have a hope and it's not a hope if we could see it it looks like it might not happen but we have hope because hope we could see is not really hope but we have a hope in what we cannot see we don't see much but we have a hope like elijah telling yourself and go look go look he said i look i see nothing but it's because of hope he said go and look again oh come on somebody help me tonight he said go look again i have a hope that rain is going to come he didn't see anything he said go look again until you see i see a claw like a man's hand and then i just say listen don't walk don't walk he say run run and tell him i hear the sound of the abolition run and tell them the rain is coming anybody with me tonight he many many men verse 26 likewise the spirit verse 26 also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make it intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered listen to this in the amplified in the same way the spirit comes to us and helps us in our weakness we do not know what prayer to offer or how to offer it as we should but the spirit himself knows our need and at the right time intercedes on our behalf with sighs and groanings too deep for words oh my you know sometimes they come to a prayer meeting and you don't even know what to pray for you don't even know what to ask for but you're so up to prominent and you know you have a need you have a desire you can't put into word paul is addressing it here in the same way you bring in a type likewise his spirit also help it when we weak when we tired when we have no strength when we barely hold it on when we don't know what to pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered we don't have the words we don't know what to ask for they say lord just help me lord i have a need i can't put it into words i don't know how to ask i don't know how to articulate it i don't know how to express it i don't know how to describe it i just know i have a need i'm not sure what the problem is i don't know how to pray is there anybody tonight look how much stuff locked up in his romans 8. and verse 27 and he that searched the hearts know it what is the mind of the spirit because he make it intercession for the saints according to the will of god hallelujah and that is what opens the door to our scripture and our title for tonight's teaching and we know and this we know is not in isolation it is in the context of everything that was said before because paul is now building feet he is taking them from being under the law of sin a debt to an understanding of the law of the spirit of life that understanding of because of what christ did and because of what his spirit could do and if you walk in his spirit what will happen and that is suffering that you will go through will never be too much that you could bear and on top of all of that when you can't pray and you don't know how to pray oh god he gonna give your words and his spirit himself will intercede for you and on top of that four we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose so paul is saying well if you didn't know before now you know that if you're called according to his purpose if you love god then all things will work together do you believe that tonight that all things god does all things well there's no accident there's no mistake there's no situation there's no trouble there's no challenge there's no trial can somebody say hallelujah tonight could somebody say yes lord somebody say thank you jesus tonight all things all things not something all things no accident you're here tonight not by accident you're here tonight not by chance what is happening in your life all is well all is well all is well god is not surprised brother ovid said it on sunday nobody could pull the world over nobody's surprising god god is not surprised tonight god is not worried tonight god not stressed out thinking about how to solve your problem he has already solved your problem you have to walk in his solution tonight the spirit has already made a way god is not now figuring it out he's not trying to work it out he's not doing no mathematics he has already done it it's our finished work oh you don't you don't have i feel like preaching this is bible study but i feel like preaching tonight because all things work together for good at the equal sign it's good when you have no money it's good when you're trying to it's good because god knows how to do it hallelujah i'm trying to close out and paul billington supporting them in this this year is i i don't know how paul was feeling when he was writing this letter but i don't think paul said and his righteous oh just so because that's so much fire i think paul was jumping paul was moving paul had to put his pen down pull out the razzy hands up if your car put this top in one letter and sit down go this is not a no this is not you writing somebody this is life you're talking about here you know or you don't hear me tonight and on top of that paul is billing he is building on it he said for whom he did for no he said if god know you once god know here before god and now meeting you tonight if he didn't foreknow you he also did predestinate not to be a church member not to be in the message not to come to the message he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son not by the law of sin and death not by rules and regulation but the conforming the image of his son could only be by the spirit that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so god by design by the spirit had christ jesus to be the firstborn among many brethren knowing fully well that there will be many brethren like who in this room tonight that could be counted as joint ears oh i don't know what kind of i would say this is tonight but if we could charge a pulpit you could touch a pulpit if you want to jump and shout you can jump and shout but this is reality this is the best way to spend a tuesday evening you know without no better way to spend a tuesday evening whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover moreover means on top of it if i want to build further i want to i want to hype it up more more over in other words it have more to it god is not dividing and subtracting he is adding and multiplying he wants your fear to be high he wants your confidence to be high he wants your joy to be high you want your expectation to be high he wants your hope to be high so moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called he called it a night not a bible study that can recall that's what he called this is part of you recognizing what you call for and whom he called them he also justified past tense not will justify god write it paul i tell you paul could not be writing this just so he said also justified he had a revelation of finnish work justified already happened when god looked at you justified and whom he justified them you also glorified past tense so when god looked at you he's seen you adopted in him he's seen you perfected you know he's seen seven living voices you know he's seen the thunder that's shaking the devil or no it's in seed form but he's looking at what you are because he is eternal we trapped in time where he is everything is done already you know oh my verse 31 we almost done what shall we then say in other words after all of that long what issue you could bring tonight what problem you could bring tonight that gorka handled he said what shall we then say to these things if god before us in 2022 as we open bible study in 2022 if god be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son because he considered this thing too important to not pay whatever price was required to reach a solution he that spared not his own son he that not only understood the cost of sacrifice he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all in other words he was willing to give his best his best thing he could do for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things all things given to you all things given to you do you know all things given to you oh my i'm not sure about orbit what time we close is not tonight in them because this thing if you catch that all things if god willing to do anything for your sake i'm not sure listen that people have struggled to do this listen i the x the expectation of hope when you see this and you get caught up in the spiritual realm of this thing and he reckons how petty problems are because some people any problem the problem seems like everything else but when they step outside and see the bigger picture i reckon but wait a minute these all these issues under my feet listen you ready to find the devil i'm knocking out you know that's why the bible said they'd say is this the man who caused nation to tremble because it reframed a perspective that this devil has no power i'm trying to close out the chapter has an end so we'll we'll we'll we'll reach our end how sadly not him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect you know what that says in the amplified who will bring any charge against god's chosen ones who have an accusation against you the devil can't even come unless god allow him to come like job this is god's elect we're talking about you know this is not all the age we're dealing with this last age here dealing with bridal who will lay anything to the charge of god who bring an accusation against you it is god that justify it in other words just my um in the amplified they said it is god who justifies us declaring us blameless and putting us in a right relationship with himself in other words it's not even you putting yourself in a right relationship god is the one who put in you in a right relationship that's why he said who can lay a charge who could bring the accusation he said i have this one covered i don't take care about a purple i don't take care but for the thumbs up i am bringing them into relationship with me and only deal with it it is god that justifies i don't care what anybody else said that's what paul's saying i don't care what nobody says it is god that justified who is he that condemn it it is christ that died ye rather is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also make it intercession for us so if you didn't know now you know christ is praying for you making intercession for you even jesus told peter i have prayed for you that your faith don't fail in 2022. so when you can pray god is praying he said make an intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation shall cover 19 uh or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us not through my strength not through your strength not because of what church we belong to but we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded this is paul saying i am persuaded i am convinced when i this is a man who was shipwrecked he get bye-bye by a snake it didn't matter you say i am persuaded everything i have seen has me totally convinced in the amplified it says i am convinced and continue to be convinced beyond any doubt that's the amplified i am convinced and continue to be convinced beyond any doubt that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come no height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is again in christ jesus our lord i trust you were blessed tonight by this little encouragement around this familiar passage of scripture of romans 8 and that he will take it into your heart with a renewed level of focus and positive energy knowing in whom you have believed and in what you have received and of faith and confidence in he who started the work is more than able to bring it to completion to bring it a pass take courage church you have what it takes there is a glory that we just read that is yet to be revealed in you not outside of you not above you it will be revealed by god himself will reveal a glory that he hid there hid it from your family hidden from your co-workers hit it from people who don't believe you can make it it doesn't matter he knows where to find it because he put that glory in you he put that seed in you before the foundation of the world that's why we can declare tonight we are not even the believers but the word in us that he put there that seed that seed germ in us that's the real believer that's your real identification that's really who you are and we are challenged tonight to become vessels that are filled by the holy spirit because only filled christians only holy ghost-filled christian that's the wise virgin now those with the extra oil and we know that the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost shall we pray heavenly father we thank you tonight lord for this little lord bible study a very familiar scripture just a foundation teaching lord to start all the bible study for this year i pray you will bless your people encourage your people follow me you encourage them through your word may the spirit follow this teaching because it is your word lord that you what you would have shared lord through your apostle and that star in the first church called paul that brother branham taught us was the gold standard by which every other messenger lord would be measured and lord to see the faith and the confidence and so many of what paul brought out he was in hardship he was in prison he was in trials and he could conclude at the end of romans 8 i am persuaded i am convinced without a shadow of a doubt after i've been shipwrecked after i've been beaten after i've been persecuted i am still persuaded after things have gone wrong i'm still persuaded after i couldn't figure some things out i'm still persuaded after a struggle i'm still persuaded he said neither death could change my mind or even life and living a good life that took a change my mind i'm persuaded that nothing will separate me and father we don't ever want to be separated from your love that can only be found in christ jesus help us tonight this group of believers this body of believers lord to bear and wrap ourselves in your love because only perfect love can make it over there with our faults with our mystics with our failures there is no way that living to the law would be able to do it because we know the law was weak the law could have never brought change but god has sent his spirit to do what he law couldn't do hallelujah you send his spirit lord true calvary you made it possible to unlock the spirit for a new law to be possible a law of the spirit of life to give us lord the police on the inside no more on the outside to give us lord the holy ghost in the control tower of our hearts help us tonight to be desperate lord to be more like you to be healed to be surrendered to be sold out to be dedicated to be committed and to be able to say like paul i am fully persuaded nothing can move me the newest car move be the negative he can't move me kobe 19 can't move me the pandemic i'm moving i'm still fully persuaded that god is real the world is real the promises are real and there will be a manifestation of the sons of god may you bless the church may you bless the the the streaming service tomorrow night may you bless the special service discover the friday may you bless the service it's coming sunday may you bless those that are here in this room may you bless those who may have made it tonight may you bless lord the believers and the portion of the bride around the world in different situations different challenges we all have our challenges we all have our struggles but we are holding on to hope i hope we may not be able to see but we know there is hope we know that there's going to be a cloud like a man's hand and this latter raid is going to fall may you bless your people in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen have a wonderful night may the lord richard bless you we love you thank you so much for making it tonight may the lord richly bless you
