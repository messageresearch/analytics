of the Holy Ghost with many testimonies of God God bless you Pastor Theo we really love and appreciate you please send our greetings to your wife family and church so brother Paul [Applause] Jacob so this morning I want to share with you the second message that I preached there uh the intelligence of God coming to the BR I think this is a very important message I preached another was streamed on Wednesday night now f is I think these are two very very important messages because this is what we are dealing with since you don't have the idea you don't have an idea of how far they've reaching science and how far they reached with technology things that you wouldn't dream and think about I mean I not here to talk science and technology and stuff but they have they have a fly something like a fly it's like electronic fly but it's really a camera a video camera spy that could go into small places and that fly is flying there and it's seeing everything and recording everything they birds that looking like a real bird there have so much things that you don't have a clue about because I truly believe that the devil was waiting for this hour and this age when the when the devil took Jesus and told Jesus all these kingdoms are mine Jesus didn't say no Jesus did not deny it this here gives Satan's full Reign by having knowledge and not only knowledge the artificial intelligence behind the information that they could access so put it this way is the first time in life they could know anybody anything anywhere at an instant the first time they have that there's no escape the Bible said all that dwell on the Earth shall take the mark of the beast except how it gets into all on the Earth the only way it could be all in is through technology that they could have all so I stayed in a hotel on my way about 9 hours to go to London and then well I had a night night over I I used to be traveling traveling from one spot to the next spot but I think I getting too old for that now so I overnight in London and the Place Hotel I stayed in was no cash you had to have a credit card or card you buy a drink tap and this tap you buy a sandwich tap they don't want no cash and with that now they could record everything that you buy I I don't care what it is if a sweety a quer ball a t people outside would know what we talking about it doesn't matter what it is they will know what you're about that's what they want I think in Europe you're not supposed to spend more than 300 cash or you can't spend more than ,000 in cash in Europe you must use a card they want to say they want to find out they want to mind your business you want to know everything that you're doing it will come to that it will come to that because a new system going to be in place that you can by yourself it cannot be what we have now a new system is coming oh praise God so we would need not our human element we would need not what we think and you know I was sharing something with someone about trust and you know you show trust to God when you don't know when you don't understand when things are going wrong this is when you have to show your trust in God when things are fine you know you have money you go to the doctor you pay your bills you do this everything is fine everything in order but when things are not so fine you say Lord I don't know how I'm get on this one help me that's how you have show trust in God when you do that God is pleased because you are showing he you know he is bigger than your problem he is bigger than your situation he is bigger than whatever you going through and I know you're going through stuff if you're not going through stuff something wrong the reason we are here in church is because we come here to get empowered we come here to get inspired we come here to get blessed we come here to be quickened unto God because the devil is rampant the lid of hell has been uncovered and streams of demon powers coming out of the earth to anoint people every day is a war every day is a battle every every day Devil's going to trap you he want to attach himself to you every day you're fighting sin you're fighting unbelief you're fighting all kind of spirits out there you have to fight you have to understand you're born to fight you were raised up to fight God put you here to fight put somebody say amen I know sometime we get tired but you can't get tired of fighting because if the you get you stop fighting the devil will kill you he come to steal to Rob and Destroy and we here to say no not me no I'm going to get my land I'm going to get back what God Ed for [Applause] me Hallelujah glory to God Amen so then you know we have to look for God to drop down which is the intelligence or the mind of God and I want you to have confidence there's a mind of God for every situation so when your intellect runs out and your logic runs out and what you think and how you think it's supposed to work out runs out you have to trust God let me repeat that when your logic run out when what you think runs out you have to trust God that is faith that is Faith when you're going past logic you're going past your reasoning you're going past everybody thought about the situation and you say I believe you I believe you God I trust you [Music] [Applause] God one of the reason people don't want to pay tights is because they don't want to trust God for the blessing that God say he will get for doing that one of the reason why people are selfish is because they think by keeping what they have they wouldn't be short but when you give it doesn't matter water food I remember my father my father was a man like this he have a dollar in one pocket and $5 in one pocket and they say got te give my five he will give it five that's how my father was and there are people like that they given people you wouldn't even know when they don't have because they always share that's how they are and there are some people who like I tell my say you know have long time people don't want to share they don't want to share exam papers they don't want to share the notes they want because if they want your child do better than a dead child all kind of foolish let people hide now you could make learn to R Roy doubles anything on internet go on YouTube you could learn Italian Dish Japanese dish Thai Dish um Nigerian dish look y I was looking to make a pepper from from from div Ivory Coast because the pepper tting so nice different pepper and I go on the internet to search and see how to do this and do that and do that and I will do that and do that and do and I will get that too and I will have Ghana pepper I will have IV co pepper they all I'm doing this different and I would learn from that you have to be a you want to want to be an idiot not to learn now you have to be want to be foolish anything you want to learn you can learn you have to want to learn and if you want to learn of God you can learn of God if you want to learn about the grace of God if you want to learn about parenting if you want to learn how to be a better husband how to be a better wife you can get that from God oh he was the first parent Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah he's the first husband hey thank you Lord Jesus so before we put on the tape just it's not long so I would just share something here but he said so he's reading the scripture have faith in God for okay so this this is it when Jesus walking he he come to a fig tree and the fct Tre had nothing he curs it next day them brothers come Master Tre dead Roots he say have faith in God if you shall say whatever you say to the mountain be moved and don't this is for you you know don't look like it's looking like it's brother to you it's for you I I look I say no you're looking too this is for all of us if you shall say to the mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart if you shall say to your child don't doubt in your heart if you shall say to that cancer if you shall say to that tumor if you shall say to whatever situation and don't doubt in your heart you you you you you can have what you say do I hear a Shou in the house this morning do I hear a praise in the house this [Applause] morning we have to preach on Miracles because people don't talk about miracles anymore but there's something called Miracles what God does instant Miracles okay the Lord I shout he could give you a miracle this morning a change of mind a change of thought a change your heart he could do it for you this morning glory to God what going to happen when God start to come with his Miracle working power not no talking power you know not no message mystery power you know not no explaining power you know I talk about the miracle working power of God we need to see that you need to understand that Oh Glory he's a god of Might and Power Glory to God so brother mam says what be moved and plucked up and cast into the sea don't in your heart but believe what you say will come to pass you can have whatever things you say us is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it not me Jesus you shall have it he said what power has been given to the church now you can express that by mental conception but when it becomes a real revelation of God you see it before it happen and express it in word form and that word takes a whole and becomes material thought Express how your heart here we go your mind is so filled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts there you are when your mind your leading your guiding becomes a direct place what does that that to do with church membership not do with this is God in you when you're M you're leading your guiding praise God hallelujah becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being oh my what kind of people should we be telling somebody I say I keep the church away from foolishness I don't talk about Bal I don't talk what other churches do I'm really not involved in that and I don't talk that because I don't want you have any funny seats towards any minister or anybody and the reason for that I want a clear platform for the Holy Spirit to come upon I don't want you fight for me I can fight for myself so I don't want to church but your God and trying to say against me is the devil had to fight this battle and I have to fight myself okay give the Lord a shout all I will ask you do is to pray for me oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God you see because when the minister so seized out the people fighting for the minister you know look this week here they arrest a man who threaten some judge and some persecutor that want to think Donald Trump no Donald Trump didn't tell him man that all Donald Trump had to do is open his mouth he telling no individual nothing you know but these people feeling lad because Trump anointing them with the spirit upon him so when it hit them so the feeling led to fight the capital the feeling led to come is that powerful thing to be a leader you know words are powerful you know and not everybody could manage things the same way so we can't just say things you have to think and keep your mouth shut some times you got to be wise understanding what the will of the Lord is he's not right but black man amen so when the Holy Spirit have you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church that would be have no canal canal inside of there you have no caral church member inside of there I can see a lot of things you know but I let that go and now they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the and this is the part I want to get to when the human element goes out so this go mash up all them Fey Fey people and you feel this one like me and just want I shake my hand and all that Fe Fe you got to get rid of that Fe Fe thing you have to believe the word of God go you're human element God want that take a exit because his Spirit have to come in and you have to make room for his Spirit how many how many want to make room Jesus said fighting no demon inside of you you know Jesus I want to come in and Jesus fighting and the demon fighting nothing that know that demon had to get cast out a way has to be made you have to open your bedroom door open the drwing room door open the front door open the gallery door you have to open the the gate around your life you have to open every single door for Christ to come in this has nothing to do with going to church this have nothing to do with coming to this church this have to do with behold I stand on the door and knock If any man hear my voice glory to God you know to come here to hear this this is the [Applause] word no excuses no excuses behold I stand on the door enough who is the eye that's Jesus who is the door that's your door of your heart what it coming to you glory to God here we go when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself then will then the church that's when the church in it power the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power and his thoughts the only weapon remain know his argument that is not no church we can argue that is church this is the church here when the human element moves out and the spirit of God moves in then God fill that vacancy God fills that vacancy God want to fill you this morning God want to seal you this morning God want to baptize you with the Holy Ghost this morning today could be your [Applause] day hallelujah hallelujah then that's when the church you may be seated in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then is your thoughts will become words and your words will become Mater IAL that's when the church in power how your thoughts could become words God give you his thoughts and then it become your thoughts so first say God thoughts then it drop down upon you then it become your thoughts and when you speak it it's your word and it becomes material Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout how many get that now is God thoughts first he leave it there he drop it in the Heart by Revelation then God thoughts become your thoughts now you're thinking the thoughts of of God that when you speak it's not the word it's got to become material now do you see how your family will be delivered do you see how your children will be delivered because God thoughts going to drop down in your heart and when you speak going to be the word and God will set them free Lazarus come forth oh give the Lord some praises the spirit and the bride say come God TS last go and we're going to sing a little chorus and we're going to move into the T prophecy I believe it's on the road when the church would be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from themselves they don't see themselves they have no but nothing but to serve God their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit walk in the spirit to fulfill the laws of Christ CHR then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind Oh Glory to God is this the word is this this not P Church you know there not a Hallelujah glory glory glory and go home this is something to get my revelation this is something for you must want and understand what God is speaking praise God let's stand and sing all over the world the spirit is moving all over the world my Lord the spirit is

our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way say the Lord for as the heavens are high than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways

glory to God you may be seated so this is achievement of science has been a forerunner of spiritual things to come but man looks backwards he look to see what this one achieve and builds on it he look what that one achieve and he builds on it but God looks forward not backward he is looking forward and believing the promises for things that never has come yet this body is going to be changed we are believing in a Rapture believe in a resurrection are in these promises listen to this just as the scientists in his laboratory are working on different things to help man listen to this now the spiritual man is looking forward to something that God promised that has never been created so brother said listen missing limbs will be restored I am looking for that somebody missing a foot they get

intelligence note not intelligence artificial but the bride the bride will have the real intelligence in of God oh glory to God in his wisdom has broken to God's laboratory there's a there's a robot that they make not controlled by man the robot has artificial intelligence and the robot will answer you whatever it want to answer you they put all the information into the robot they do all this stuff and the robot could hear see could talk could answer they have a robot that could prepare menu meals the hands could crack egg and fry eggs and do all kind of stuff put clothes in washing machine take it out without any assistance that is where man reach man want to create another man man by science want to reproduce himself but God told Adam be fruitful and multiply we are going to have real sons born Sons F Sons Sons just like the father Sons just like Jesus Sons just like God it will be a reproduction of the Original Seed Lord planted a seed that seed is in you that seed will come alive Glory you may be seated Oh Glory to God so El musk by technology he has a company to put implants into your brain they did it into a man call Brain interface and this operation is so difficult a human being cannot do the operation a robot has to do the operation and robot will cut the brain and connect all the synapses and all the nerves to this computer interface in the brain and they did it and the object of this interface is that the person could control things with their thoughts with their mind and the gentleman who got that place into him was just revealed about two weeks ago he 29 years old and he is paralyzed from his shoulder goes down so he has no feelings in his body his shoulders come down but with this inter in his brains he is watching the computer and controlling the mous with his thoughts so he is playing chess he is playing games and he is happy to have this in his brain now what they want to make artificial eye artificial Hearts they really want man to live forever outside of the Gospel but all of that it is man's intelligence it is man's thoughts but today we are coming into God's intelligence and God thoughts so regardless of what man's achieved they cannot stop a bride that connects to the mind of Christ Oh Glory to [Applause] God the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness Paul said I will destroy the wisdom of the wise Paul said it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save men that believe Oh Glory to God do you see that the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than man so when David came to his brothers and heard gol David never look at gol size David never look at gol condition prophesy and David did not bother with gol prophecy cut your head off that was

is upon you listen David wasn't ready yet to be king but he was anointed you are not ready yet but you are [Applause] anointed SE so the prophet said all the scriptures let is laying here in the word it just lead out it just take someone to come on the scene to manifest those promises and then he said these words faith in the call of [Music] [Applause] God and you this morning after have Fai in the call of God William had to believe that malach was about himam had to believe that Luke 17 was about him William had to believe that Revelation 107 was about him and you the bride Revelation 527

to be a church member God call you to be a foolish version God call you wise virgin Glory Glory Glory brother Bram to have faith in his calling his faith seed had to be ripened the prophet said where is that R and Malachi for seed the message so Faith could grow Faith could add Faith could mature R and the rightous of God the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith to Fai everything is faith everything of God is the faith Revelation Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah now this is where we at now Jesus himself is the interpretation of the Bible if it's the hand age it must be the hand if it's the voice age it can't be the foot now we are in the age next to come seeing prophe so he was saying he Willam Bram was the age of the eyes listen to these words now there is nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step onto it and the last thing there is the next is the intelligence so God give the prophet the eyes to see but the bride gets the intelligence you are next after the prophet it's the bride oh to God do you see it how many see it after the prophet is the bride to God now listen to this he has governed the body all the way through watch this then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken from his side the next is the intelligence listen which is Christ itself who controls the whole body who controls the whole body Christ who controls all body a man from America no a man from Europe a man from Africa a man from South America [Applause] no Christ controls the entire [Applause] body all right when Peter and the apostles received the Holy Ghost itself Jesus was manifesting himself through them Christ veiled in their flesh manifested manifest Made Alive like he was in Moses so in other words these last days Sons will unveil [Applause] God now to unveil God you have to Veil God you have to have God to unveil God praise God says when the word was in Moses he was God in flesh when it was in Jesus it was God in flesh he changed his mask not his word not his nature and he's the same yesterday today and forever that same God would Veil himself in a fold Ministry God as a prophet God as an apostle God as aor God as a teacher God as a evangelist five gifts five offices Oh Glory to God glory glory understand this in every age had a power to with the devil so God's intelligence came by the seven spirits through seven ages in every age the mind of God came by one of those Spirits calling the names of the Believers in that age every Age The Bride overcame the devil the spirit that is promised to you and me already defeated the devil you are not trying to defeat you are not trying already defeated the devil tonight today we Victorious vibrations of Heaven Victorious said vict on the earth vibrations from Heaven Oh Glory to God we are we tonight we have Victorious vibrations praise God hallelujah hallelujah so brother Bram first Thessalonians 4:16 the shout the voice and the Trump so William Bram he came and identified the shout that seven Thunders that's what gathers the bright together that shout is found in Revelation 10 three and four Mighty Angel open his mouth seven tunders their voices up to get you those standards those ters is not for church members tunders is only for the bride praise God but next is the voice of the Archangel William he identify shout will the bride identify the voice of the Archangel I say yes we are here who identify voice of the archangel which is the voice of the Resurrection call the dead listen Jesus does all three the shout The Voice the Trump done by Jesus Jesus Jesus in the prophet Jesus in a Min Jesus in give some pra Glory so the spirit is the word and the word is the spirit and the spirit is the intelligence and ration identify Spirit coming to the bride that's your scriptures that's your word the spirit and the bride not the spirit and the pop the spirit and the bride because the bride will be the final voice the final age they heard the prophet they will hear the bride the bride has a voice oh glory to God this is beyond this is beyond that this is goding a bride once more the prophet said once more the world will hear direct from God how how would your loved ones come in because you will have the blood on you you will have the voice of Mercy Spirit and the bride say come let him that he say come whoever will that's your family that's your loved ones you are going after them come mini SK come hand woman come it doesn't matter what condition The Voice will go and say come whoo will the spirit and the Bri for the same voice that joh the same voice that someon Lazarus from the grave that voice of the archangel he said Christ is the voice of the Archangel so we know the voice of the Archangel is not a man Christ is the voice of the Archangel no brother said appearing and coming is two different words he appear in his bride and appearing a sign of is coming Jesus comes before Jesus comes to appear us among you he has to appear it will be the appearing of the Lord a sign of the coming of the Lord said the appearing and coming is two different things the appearing of the Lord is now Hallelujah we see him appearing among his people Jesus said nothing can harm this bright not even death for if the seed is planted water will raise it up the SE here a secret the word is in the Bri and she has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word mind of Christ is the intelligence oh praise the name of the Lord praise God so God's word God's message is his mind Philippians 3 he said let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded if okay okay um if if if anything be likewise minded and God shall reveal the rest unto you now in the Amplified Paul was explaining what perfect is those of us who are spiritually mature and grown up have this mind so when when we talk about perfect you're speaking about spiritually mature it means to be complete it means to be full grown it means not to be a b every trial come you carry on every test come you get upset you have to become mature that's becoming perfect in second second Corinthians 10 verse Paul said for our weapons of our Warfare are not caral but Mighty through God to the PO of strongholds here we go casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ in the amplifi that verse five it says refuting arguments and we lead every thought and purpose away captive to The Obedience of Christ think about it the mind of Christ bringing imagination under control bringing every thought into control bringing thoughts into captivity thoughts of Pride eny power you want Power with no bring to captivity so the Dynamics even charity even the spirit is the mind of Christ and the mind of Christ praise God is the Capstone and seven Thunders is the Capstone revelation of Jesus chist said time shall be no more seriously think if it is then the pyramid C like the seven tunders the seven tunders is the Capstone Revelation and the Capstone manifestation when they cap comes Upon Our Lives we have the mind of Christ settled over us Paul called charity the bond of perfectness Charity to seal all the virtues no leaks in the building to God hallelujah glory to God okay let's go there are three elements a man follows first humanistic second is divine revelation and the third is Vision that is th say the Lord then he said it a little different elsewhere he said first is humanistic we say I will pray for that person I'm hoping that they get well next is divine revelation that is when something in your heart an it and you know it's going to happen but the third element is Vision or the word of the Lord made manifest so what is the mind of Christ the thoughts of God comes down into your heart and you express it by the word without a vision but the word is a vision by itself because God said my word shall not returnto me vo so when it thoughts come into your heart is no longer God thoughts it's your in your heart and when you speak it's not your way God word your mouth that word can't return for it oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brother is with a man say how are you Donavan and a man a cancer so brother said why didn't you say something about it and the brother said I didn't want to bother you for the speaks I just put my hand over on him never said a word two days after that there wasn't even a scar what is it the quick them power it will Quicken your mortal this thing is real his air would have eat off his brains would have been gone he would have died but the quickening power then he went the quickening power took me over the curtain of time to see all of you over there brother saw the bride saw you over there you have to see you he said all you ever [Applause] loved and all love you they are given to you and I have seen them all over there what was it the quick power the quicking power open the seven seed what was that the intelligence of man no the quicking power of God he is the one who open those seals he is those seals what's the open of the seals revealing Christ oh my hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God thank you Jesus God designs man body he designed us to come together in Heavenly places and have these Supernatural workings through the gifts of the Spirit of Prophecy of wisdom of knowledge of gift of healing not as an individual so much but as a unit we all together one great body of Believers the Mystic body of Jesus Christ and Satan by the law of sin and death he brought death Satan sends cancer the man recognizes it receives it Satan sent heartaches we recognize it and receive it but if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man how much more god with his power make his La work in Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the law of sin puts in the people but the law of Liberty of Christ has come to set us free from those things and listen to these words I believe with all my heart we are nearing the age when people are going to recognize these things we need a revolution of thinking and that's what the mind of Christ does mind of will give you a new mind to think the way God thinks to see the way God sees to speak the way God speak and to live the way God live praise God praise God if we could thr ourselves completely to God do his will and be lost to our own thoughts and let the mind of Christ be in US them same operation of the spirit will work through US Christ have to die to Quicken us you are you ready you have got to die yourself you have got to die every thought of the flesh so you can receive mind of Christ not your own but his mind you to be completely surrendered your own thoughts your own will your own mind and let mind of Christ operate you just yield myself to him and he uses my mind my eyes my mouth he just yield spoke about a woman when he prayed for her there was not one trace of Luka found in the child the power of God take the bloodstream and cleanse it out then begin to prophesy I'm almost finished I believe that the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored will be Resto glorious power of the creator he can make a Sr appear from [Applause] nothing so you missing an ovary or you missing a spleen or missing liver or missing a finger or the Creator that right back [Applause] out have you heard about the woman Without Eyes born without eyes she came to be prayed for and when by pray a light to swirl by her eyes over sudden he says stop I forgot
