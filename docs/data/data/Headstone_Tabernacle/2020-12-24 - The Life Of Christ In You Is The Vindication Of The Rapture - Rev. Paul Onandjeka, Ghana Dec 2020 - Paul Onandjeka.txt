more time as we have a testimony amen pastor solomon god bless you for the opportunity to ask me to greet the brother jesus christ in your local area and also for the the convention that you have it's an honor i want to thank you for your heart and what you do for god's people uh because you said that the theme is centered around the manifestation of the sons of god i want to read romans chapter 8 and from verses 14 to 23 and just to greet you all in jesus name as various are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry over the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god in children then as as of god and joint as the christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i report that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest exploitation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him was subject to saving hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation growth and travail in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which are the first fruit of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to witness the redemption of our bodies god bless you all um just uh send ingredients to you from canada uh the lord bless you all church and the topic your your pastor was selected is looking for the manifestation of the sons of god when god stands will will be revealed will be manifested and they will be in position to enter to be in charge now the scripture is here that as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god we need god's leadership and that leadership can only come when we have accepted the holy spirit when the power of god comes into our lives it does something either with us not only that it said that we have also received the spirit of bondage to fear fear brings doubt when fear is gone it brings faith and in the absence of fear we need faith in our lives that the word of god will be able to be received it also speaks that we have also received the spirit of adoption whether we cry our father and so this is where we are now we are not only cells of god but we are adopted sons of god amen what does it mean it means that not every son that is born has a right for inheritance you got to end that and god places two tests with that child a paul speaks english is for about a child going through two days and god has sent us a message of child training in a child figure out that daily cause is in the family he can do whatever he wants he'll be seeing everything but to be adopted means this it doesn't mean that god has to look for somebody who's not his child and bring him into the kingdom and that don't pass his child that's no good the way adoption works if god's kingdom in god's kingdom would be their very son that is born in the family had been adopted by his own dad amen therefore god puts those children under the hands of truth and that teacher is a resolve between the father and the son the father is asking for reports the progress of how the boy is behaving how he's doing why because someday he is going to leave all his inheritance into that child for him to manage his properties and if the boy is going to take it and squander the whole thing is nothing to rule and so for us to be manifested at the sons of god we gotta pass the test of adoption god has to trust us he has to believe that the world cannot do what they are doing now we us as children should be able to do what they cannot do they are liars their teeth they don't feel the truth they they satisfied one another we can be in the same world our spirit is not a spirit of the world and so i am beating you all in the name of the lord jesus christ that we need to come into adoption it means then that we have been trained properly our characters have been molded we have received the message and it has done something within us and that what it has done we are seeing an effect of what the world is going through the politicians can't keep the world they are trying their best but they can't keep it look whatever they are doing to make this work has side effects is that they give you a medicine to heal you from something it has side effect on the other side if you take it too long you develop something else they gotta give you something else to go on and that's what they're doing they're changing from one thing to the next hoping that this will work and this will not work but someday and it does cost their own earth to grow things are out of shape nature is blowing we are receiving all kinds of hurricanes and drugs and and shortages of life upon the face of the earth all because the ecosystem is changing a man is part of that because god says that he will destroy them who corrupt the earth and they are all waiting for the glorious liberty of the sons of god they want adam to come back and run again because when adam was ruling them it was at peace but when they were broke then all this chaos came i tried the holy spirit that in the rapture of the lord is preparing to take us from this earth show them very soon keep your ankles strong make sure that not only that the holy spirit in your life becomes just uh one aspect but misha that the word of god has an impact upon you you just want to be like your father if god should be asked the report of us what report will the holy ghost give about you and me and so i leave you with this uh this morning from here that the lord jesus christ bless the meetings will he heal the sick that is sitting there fill those who need the holy spirit to be healed servants should be granted to those who need him above all strengthen your merits and make sure that the power of the of the message of the hour remain strong with you there are so many voices out there stay true to the world and so on on behalf of our local assembly down here we say goodness to you in ghana in jesus christ's name amen amen amen amen you appreciate that testimony hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name amen let's sing that song i will praise the lord no matter what tomorrow brings what it hasn't so i know i will praise the lord

this fellowship if the life of christ is in you hallelujah you are back in this fellowship you are back in this fellowship and it is a vindication that you shall be raptured that you are in the rapture this but the genuine predestination of gods celebration this genuine churn the true gem [Music] in god before the foundation of the world [Applause] it is not your mouth your earthly eternal

all the time but your soul was so annoyed that something will lift you up higher about the thing your soul is in a dimension that the world knows nothing about jesus said they are in the world but

another world or rather in another dimension even here today in the form of the spirits his spirit is united with us our physical eyes cannot see him because they are still physical unless something happens so that we can see the vision but he's here as a principal as real that he was in the day when he spoke to marriage in the grave when he met cleopas on the way of a mouse his presence is here but your physical eyes cannot see him the holy spirit is in a dimension that your physical eyes cannot see this is why brother perovid always used to say no church no group [Music] can contain the holy spirit and say we we are the ones the holy ghost belong to us and the other stuff and the others don't have it is us it is us it is for us amen amen amen amen because the holy spirit is in the dimension [Applause] the holy spirit is not an organization the holy spirit never be a denomination the holy spirit is a person and he is in a dimension no church can say it is for us alone it is for us alone it is for us alone the holy spirit is in a dimension you are also in a dimension and you fellowship with the holy spirit they are in the world but they are not from the world and at that time your soul is in the presence in the presence of the holy spirit in the presence of the holy spirit hallelujah hallelujah your soul is not in cathedral neither in ghana neither somewhere in africa no no no no he is in a dimension and the holy spirit is here as i am preaching he is in a dimension but my soul my soul testify my soul that is his nature be a record you can feel his presence but he is in a dimension [Applause] he will never be a denomination he will never be an organization for he is in a dimension [Music] your sinful nature is changed your nature of stealing of lying of being crook is changed to become its nature and this very soul this very divine nature is also in a dimension and your soul is magnetized with the holy spirit and the holy spirit it is a direct fellowship with your creator no group can say we are the only one keeping the holy spirit it means that you don't understand you cannot bound god you cannot say no god the holy spirit is in a dimension and when your soul is in this very dimension and then you have fellowship with your father and this is the communion that adam had this is the communion that the apostles have come this is the communion for which god sent malachi foreign god said i will respond back and probably abraham said the holy spirit is here is your physical as in the time as in the days where he was at the grave of lazarus you cannot see him but he is present in a dimension and if your soul is caged you know that is hearing when you say jesus is here you know what you are talking about you know what you are talking about oh

afternoon as sure that there is a heaven and hell jesus christ is present at this very moment but the problem is in an invisible dimension we cannot see him but there is something in the soul of the
