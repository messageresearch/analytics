transform our lives but our lies that be pleasing unto you father may your healing virtue flow flow this is our untwine even now leader touch a new father wrote about a mac mail even now leave not

the beer tonight Amen god bless you if our Bibles are ligated to Romans chapter 7 second Corinthians up the tree and then we go to Romans up to 12 verse 50 reading tonight Romans chapter seven million from verse one to six know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law but the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which had an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of a husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if a husband be dead she is free from the law that law so she's no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit on the court for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit on the debt but now we are delivered from the law that being dead where we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit are not in the oldness of the letter and reading from second Corinthians chapter three do we begin to commend ourselves or need we are some others epistles of commendation to you letters of combination from you Yahoo pistol written in our hearts known and read from you from all of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be a pistol of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart okay let's continue and such trusts have we true Christ a God would not that we are sufficient ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who what meters evil ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit to give it life and I'll ask of you from Romans chapter 12 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that what is that what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God s ballheads Father we thank you for your word tonight you come and interpret it to our hearts and speak Lord to us know that our lives will be changed and the image and likeness granted father in Jesus and I ask it amen you may be seated or praise the Lord tonight our title courts power to transform his seed to produce his kind God's power to transform his seed to produce his kind of a conduct scripture from Genesis 1 it says in the beginning God created heaven in the earth it was a tall form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and this period of God move on the face of the waters and God said let there be light and it was light and God saw the light that it was good and God devises a light from the darkness and God called the light day the darkness he called night and the evening in the morning were the first day and God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so and God called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day and God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered again in one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and God called the dry land earth the garden together of the waters called he seas and God saw it was good and God said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so on the it brought forth grass of the appearance seed after his kind and the tree even fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw it was good so if I know from Genesis 1:26 every seek on the bring forth after its kind and but abandonment is invisible unit brightest prenup prayer you seal God knowing she know fragile we are knowing that we are walking on the brittle treads of life of this mortal life not knowing what time that we're going to be someone's to answer on hi let us O Lord lay aside everything in our heart everything in our mind and look straight to your word tonight for you to come and interpret it but live in Oracle's grant it may your spirit fall upon us and anoint the wood or heart that we might go from here this evening better people that we are now but we might have a closer insight on Jesus Christ granted Lord that we might understand the day we are living and the preparation of God for this hour for his people miss our this great crucial dark time that we're now living in God anoint us not only speaker but here and together make our hearts to tremble at your word for the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom grant these things father we ask in Jesus name Amen oh praise the name of the Lord what a prayer oh praise the name of the Lord are you ready for the word tonight so we know we find out that Elohim he men came down and spoke to Abraham when Sarah died wife and this all spoke or agency Brown says and he said I'm going to visit you I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and you're gonna have that baby that you're waiting on and hear the prophecy the Lateran is fixin to fall you have held that seed in there long enough believing but you are looking for coming son but he is coming so right now tonight you're under prophecy of the Lateran fixin to fall so that's that's the seer the Lord nobody could change that nobody could say that not going to happen so the rain is not the problem or glory that God is if the seed is there or glorious his seed has to be there isn't that right so he said the real church today you said God has promised be careful God has promised in Malachi 4 for this last day and Malachi 4 he was saying this has not yet been fulfilled it must be fulfilled because it is the germanized Word of God spoken to Malachi the prophet all scripture has to be fulfilled must be and the Bible is to be finished the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when his anointed messenger arrives of course listen he will plant the seed of the entire Bible plumb from the serpent to the messenger in the former rain so the prophecy was that the end the seed of the entire Bible would be planted that was what peravaram came to do to plant the seed of the entire Bible and there are only two Bibles well Gloria has gone to zodiac the pyramid and this Bible that we have so that pyramid Bible was the seed that per around him the plant a Bible inside of you isn't that right Oh glory to God so this prick Scripture we read and balarama's was given it and invisibly on the bride Paul was given illustration about margin divorce it pertains the greater portion of margin divorce and hold that he's trained in certain order the church can no more be married to the world and the christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it then it can be a woman to be living with a husband while she has a live-in husband no he said I believe is to my belief that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of prophecy no woman is always tied to church because the church is considered a bride she's the bride for the Lord Jesus and if you watch the conditions of one conduct a woman you would see where the church is at you watch anything in the natural and nature and watch it in the spiritual also and if you watch the conduct of woman in the world today what's the convict duck of worldly churches today and the conduct of the spiritual bride the natural so-called cream to be bright notice when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival begins the honey revival when she begins to come back and line yourself up with the Word of God so all this is prophecy the bride will begin to line yourself up back the Word of God watch them again how the scripture at that time there'd be a message sweep up to cut that break or glory that God's of God looking for their hearts that want to line up with this world because the world is the conduct of the Spirit isn't that right and today oh praise God we see the church natural in your intellectual gospel going further and further away from the world in social gospel we find a woman of the world on the streets members of such kind himself and the same atmosphere they have lost the sense of command see there she is that is her behavior but you'll notice when the people begin to try to line up with the word there comes a fresh message from the Word of God straight to the people and they catch that message and line up with it every time remember what the message come to do we pay our hearts for the coming of the Lord is the message of preparation you have a message out for on my second coming I'm John was center for on the first coming of the Lord and the message was PPA either way of the Lord isn't that right so Paul was saying a woman cannot remarry until a foolish husband is dead she cannot remarry as long as her first husband is living by no circumstances at all she must remain single as long as a foolish husband is living and other than that she being silly she recorded an adulteress right he said no watch saw the church when she tries to mix Creed and denomination with the Word of God she can't be married to denomination and be the Bride of Christ at the same time she has got to be deadly to one or the other there's plenty of lodging boys would and Paul was speaking the same thing she cannot be married to a church or worldly creed and be the Bride of Christ if you are married to Christ here we go Christ is the word or glory to God so you get locked in yeah I've nothing to do what your husband said what the church say what the bishop see is what the word say or Gloria has got crisis a word and he's the Living Word he always was the word he is still the word and he will be the word he was the only the manifestation of the attributes of God because he was the son of God so Christ the word was the actual manifestation of the attributes of God and any son is an attribute of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet you could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you and to the Bennigan's of a mother you were brought forth into the earth and becoming the image of your father and then he could fellowship with you so were you sons and daughters of God before there was a moon before there was the star molecule you are sons and daughters of God and you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that she wasn't gone in the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it did you know anything that when you were in your earthly father but you are manifested in his image in the image of God you are made you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship of God I want to highlight that that tonight you were manifested for what for the glory and the fellowship of God God wants fellowship or glory that God don't go to want your silence he wants your praise he wants your worship he wants tell us if he wants your communion with him isn't that right and I'll show us your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual gene had to be in God because you are an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world no we are wrong it so these torches that were about an expression we can't get away from it you have to be a gene in his thoughts you have to be his seed to bring forth his cane because there's a kind that God has there has to be producing this last day we remember seed only our potential until it comes forth you don't know what I see really is or glory to God so it have potential in seed but until the seed be manifested you don't know what that scene really is Oh glory to God the seed after come forth to be vindicated to be manifested to be Express or glory they've got pumpkin seed and wallop watermelon seed it looks similar it's not the same so if you hold the seeds in your hand you don't know watches pumpkin you know what is watermelon but plant it whoa let the rain fall on it let the vine begin to grow then you will see what this pumpkin and what is watermelon or glory there boychik what put the seeds on the earth honey pant it isn't that right hallelujah no the rain is about to fall that's the prophecy 6 into 4 or hallelujah that thank you Lord the nomination has separated the people from the Word of God then Jesus said you through your tradition of me the commandments of God of no effect and through our Creed we have disassociated the fellowship of the holy spirit to anoint the will of God that is for our generation also sit and see any trick of the devil to twist the word that the anointing cannot come on the word to anointed to make it live for your time and season Oh hallelujah and Gordon every generation adds a new part of his book it also gets a goes together like my body was built it started from the spine and wasn't all spine is went to ribs and lungs and her hands and arms and feet and it come out to be the person that I am so God manifested in the beginning he appeared as Jehovah God the Father he has PSS got the Sun in Jesus Christ now we are Pierce has got the Holy Ghost the same God three manifestation of the same God and God has allotted his word from the beginning so we are not in Luther's age we're not in Wesley age we got into the headship age where the Holy Ghost is calling a Holy Ghost Bunch or to be honed and to be cut them to be fitted in the headstone calling you to higher ministry we believe that so just like evolution just like the first thing created and hope that how the signs get messed up because they saw a progression from frog to dis the animals right of the monkey and then man so they saw something looking like it is evolution but God was startled on the small bone right at all not evolution money come from monkey or glory to God God said let us make man isn't that right so what's he saying you know he said like botany like then and in my life he created human life evolution rising higher so has been Gordon his truth just being shot on a looter pulling that right out then I just lesion looter certification the Wesley he the evolution of the spirit or glory that God that's a bill called the evolution of the spirit justification and tip of the spirit certification another tip of the spirit the penny cousin another different the spirit what we going for into the person of the whole course itself or glory their God every wrong has to go higher but because I lost some praises tonight because it's a body he is building that is coming to a head is that that gesture is a body or either God is that right John was the neck and Jesus was the head that chap of the Old Testament and he become the cornerstone of the new testament or glory of God and John the Baptist John Jesus hallelujah John Elijah coming his last day to be the neck as it was to introduce the Messiah his head check the full body word or glory that God is that right so if you're married at Christ she the bride gonna be married to a church in nomination at the same time she cannot live with both husbands they are contrary one to another let every man will be a lie and mine be true a woman is entrusted with certain characters she must not defile a woman is trusted to that there's not a creature like a woman there's no female dog no female of any kind and trusted with the character that a woman is a woman was not even in the beginning of the creation because God no he would fall all other females could not commit adultery she's the only one that could commit adultery and she has been made if she had been made like the original that would have been this complementary to God's great wisdom but she was a byproduct of a man and because she was cast over in that side she also have been given a sacred charge on God for redemption she got character she must not defile her body is given to her a sacred trust no female dog no bird Norah Manimal norther creature like she is the only one the reason it is so sacred is because she has to bring what life into the earth her body is the betting rounds of life dear father that's the reason he gives this a secret trust notice we find her body is the bed and groans therefore it's a sacred trust not to define that I'm speaking out bringing this illustration to show you where the church stands I'm not speaking of you woman whatever you are that's between you and God and you men I'm speaking of the church and Christ and she is given to bring forth life only God Himself can give her husband might be the jewel Mira but God Himself has to produce the life that's in the natural what more in the spiritual which man could produce the life it will take God to produce life or his court to produce life that all life has to come from God any life has to come from God it's perverted it's sinful but life has to come from God because he's the author of life or glory no God can we get a lot of shout life has to come from God whereas the prostitute weathers a whole long it doesn't matter life comes from God someone she has a secret trust of womanhood committed to her she must not break the womanhood I'm speaking of here is a conduct a character around men now keep the church in mind she's kissing and slopping and mixing with everything else but the word let the devil and education and so forth she has a sacred womanhood now we find out she has been given this sacred trust she must not break of womanhood and I corrected to research ildren to be honorable to husband what a secret trust what a responsibility to almond you see why she the type of the church which has there we go the same responsibility as a woman has a secret ability to her motherhood to her virtues to a husband the church has a secret responsibility to prayer to the word and to Christ just the same as all my night all glory to God today here better internet the church have a sacred responsibility to prayer to the word under Christ I went the Holy Spirit told about the man I'm bigger than and right he said the church the bride church comes to the headstone in the last days will be a super church a super race as she nears a headstone they will be so much like him they will be this very image so that is the purpose of this message that we could be conformed to the image of Christ the purpose is best is not about vials and walls and plagues and Rome and Los Angeles dynami purpose that's that's friends the goal for the message the message address the whole it the message addressed all loosens serpent seed but that knowledge is that what images come to give the message come to bring an image that we can become that image because you become what you behold if you don't see it you can't become it you have to see you to become it to become what you behold we stand on a glass and by being changed and being transformed from glory to glory as we see that image we become like that you have to see it you have to see see something bigger than yourself you have to be rather little evil in the banner of the chicken because you only see a chicken you feel you are chicken because you only see ordinary folks you see you all guys but you are not only folks you are causing something higher and when that greek mother is a stretcher swinging and fire when a banyan that little English or something bigger than him more powerful than him that connect with him just like him I'm not sure one of him Oh God hallelujah do you see that tonight and ghostly strike was the inaudible ordinary folks they were smokers drinkers whatever whatever it is tax collectors trust buds and Jesus called him hallelujah Jesus pray and they are not of this world father keep them don't give us them to me before the foundation of the world Jesus praying in a different realm all together and these guys foolish but he said that day you shall know I'm in the Father you with me are you but at the level where they were active will clueless that they belong to a higher order and they wanna bring what after his kind because there was his kind because it had his seed that's why I come to call them that's why I come to call you that's why you are called Osborne how because I get natural thing but because of the gene Jim seed inside of you all could BCE men or glory to God Oh hallelujah hallelujah mrs. listen they will be much like him so much like him that they will be in his very image in order to be united with him they will be one there will be one that is a guarantee they will be one hallelujah no more Twain but one or glory recorded husband and wife is one hallelujah the brain in Christ will become one that's right she said when you see me you see the father because he was one with his father or chlorine of God and you will be one with your Lord this spirit will be in here this spirit will be upon you this pyramid floats for you what day will be one there's gonna be one Lord there's only one said this won't be one baptism or glory love God hallelujah glory to God denominations can never produce this because the nominations take it I put it on a man put it on a system the people trust his system of the church the system the job of the system the trust that oh and any time they would come contracted that they believed the system instead of staying with the world but the spoken word is the own business seed every regional seed after bring forth after his kind or glory now God once we talked and spoken word here we talking original seed was here in spoken word you know you're getting original seed because man didn't speak it is God speaking all was a sudden I must be real to apprentice a prophet you again gosh here's a lot tonight every time you English spoken one is a seed to inside your soul because the Son of Man is the saw and the word is the seed or get a lot of salt or blowing of God hallelujah oh you should be praising him tonight just blessed to be here in spoken with not some man talks not so my name is an opinion not some private interpretation but spoken words enemy doctors cover here that this cover that greeted me and God said let there be light let there be light spoken word that's all for this before this sons my spoken word you must be born again like a winner tonight is spirit that's how corners below the Sun I just spoken word my PSP the word the Holy Ghost selling them that's where the world is the spoken word or we bring back to that brethren we're going back to that come on your son's began to speak your word I'm gonna be easy I'm gonna be delivered I'm gonna be filled I'm gonna be adopted we can speak your word or going a party and God said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose my second thought on these sinners word the brief water pride you can't help it you got to comfort you got to be manifested Oh every scene is kinda be manifested that is a liar tonight you still a healer Timothy live around there we give breakthroughs stay provoke miracles I don't care doctors all are only tonight he's a miracle worker tonight but the doctor give up on you he's still a miracle worker tonight oh don't give up on yourself don't give up on yourself thinking about yourselves don't give up on yourself don't give up on door oh he won't give up on you he's ever [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so any group any system I can't mess it already mess it doesn't matter that go on into the dominant stuff dead help bounce back from nothing because the nomination is not Maccabees the mission is sin nomination is Nicollet and the domination is what quad hits because it's excute god screw the leaves of the Holy Spirit we commence which is dominant and that's what God hates because man fallen woman could do which man could add one committee structure you had your cutting good tours and I go then you don't need Christ you wretched you're miserable you're born in sin you're a liar to begin with every man-jack all these liars think about the dough and the code fancy clothes and fancy car they're liars the Catalina Liars Bible said born and friend sherry Liberty commented world speaking lies because I'm Justin and Tyler Lyons wear white coat white everything is the liars they need confusion they need to be born again then we fire every man-jack need fire hallelujah don't be afraid to testify didn't need God they're making more the knees caught but the need for any halt give me power to meet God need a testimony your witness remember the Connolly but they will be the very manifestation of the wood of the living gorgeous bright denominations can never produce this they reduced their crease and dogmas mixed with the world and bring a hybrid product the first son was a spoken seed would first son what it was said let us make man in our image and all like this speak Adam o Adam comedy motor words then God formed a dustman what you see in all tonight form annals of the earth take some doesn't bring him off from there and put this first man inside of that man got it first time was a spirit man there was no man to destroy there was no physical man but the first man with our spirit man and God put that spirit man and a physical body that's why course it does the lacked and to dust oh shut we came to behave like that I said you know right back where you come from or glory of God you understand what I'm saying because God yes the deepest world oh my now the first time was a spoke more seed of God he was giving my brain to reproduce himself so the object of this thing called brain is for reproduction so Christ having a bribe because he want children after his kind not just as a immaturity of a bride that's to produce his kind a reproduction of the theme original book of acts a reproduction of what the apostle's have that's why William animus Center Tillinghast back to the faith of the fathers because that was the came that quad producing original brother George that is alpha church that's how to be really a church we don't want nothing less than that we act like nobody talked us out to that the Holy Ghost is just as real as when they headed back here we want that same real thing I don't wanna think shorter that nobody's shake no buckle and say hold up no no we want the real thing let's pitch I can make it we can make it a monk are making we can make it if he not gonna make it you can make it if Moses that make it you can make it I can make it you can make it more than he was of hebrews hebrews 11 all and people even people you can make it hallelujah praise God and you have an opportunity to shine like never before because this is a darkest age this is the darkest hour they went cross darkness cover the earth and close that with other people so you like shining light right now because yet but the Lateran is fixin to for a fool yeah you are after his kind or glory not God that she is God inside of you alright so watch so the bright fell like even the bride was given to produce themselves not as somehow he fell by high breeding produce himself she fell causing to die the second Anna which is Jesus Christ spoken C word of God virgin shall conceive and bear a son like spoken-word son coming the Kannada but before he could marry this bride she falling - Adam wife believed God's would live she talked it and died she did then he said from another group of the true seed of the world God will present Christ a beloved bride a Phrygian version of his word and true them and by their will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the version who knows no man-made Creed's or dogmas no private interpretation no private dream no private idea despite only notice here the Lord she already know what God said despite not me like you the devil twisted Eve he asked me what God said Eve said we make a god servic eat of every tree but a tree in the midst of we shall not eat for the day we eat we shall surely die and then you got never tell her we shall not surely die and she received that this battle receiveth nothing except you said a spirit the bride and the prophet will see the same thing and what they say what I've already been said in the world so no new mystery I come in a tiny up Halloween no new interpretation gonna tie me up I okay my angel come over the short shining I weigh so much read back wings I don't care what kind of wings he have if it not but the Prophet said let the Angels I write back where he come from find the wings and all take the same speed you come go back without chp go god has sent you or glow in a gaudy cellar prophet to reveal the entire mystery it has been revealed oh no we can judge the Angels by the word or cuz the Lord our show we're gonna judge them angels by the word hallelujah oh my from a little group of the true seed of the world god represent a Christ virgin bride the word of promise in himself like a mercenary god himself made manifest he there we go will act himself by his own word of promise so to fulfill what was written of him so as he did when he was here in the Virgin womb oh my hallelujah she said be done to me as though I said do it was set by an angel while I was yet written wood so it was written word of British I conceived and everything else but the angel said come along said to her and she said be it done unto me according to thy word they would love him a David loved him and they will have his potentials they would have what say it out here's what his pretensions for he is their head and they are his subjects my movie help me someone the king is he boss lies the kingdom and subjects of the kingdom I mean if you are subject you follow the laws of the kingdom to be back to that Kingdom but he is their head and they're his subjects isn't that right and they are subject to his headship of Christ what a harmony Jesus never did anything until he's seen of the father and

to us tonight we want to hear from you hallelujah what I hear from you glory to Lord what harmony sin John 5:19 so with the bride or nothing at hammer not even net for if the sea be planted the water will reach it up oh I got a big grin hallelujah here here's a secret the word is in the bride Oh glory to God and a magnet Christ or glory to God under silence - or they have a clue you sitting in church bowling game and glory hallelujah and gorgeous loading you up it would see see see see what's in your mercy your flesh do you understand it your mind can hold it but God trouble aside yours they were just dropping the decided yeah but still will be who you are because he's definitely who Jesus was and if he couldn't understand who Jesus was he didn't even think about understanding who you are but you I'll show you sure so a mighty army oh he secured tolls or you or the other prophet saw you and said of people that know that God shall be strong and be great exploits was prophets got in the spirit and I'll show you victorious they saw you overcoming even Malik I saw you he said the half of the children before I send you elijah the prophet and he shall turn the house of the children back to the faith i see them t7 tunnels winter after the voices see it a powerful new strike the church and when the father's church rises you're gonna bring the bread room when the power of that church rises it's gonna bring the bedroom then there will be a general resurrection but the power going to strike the lottery secrets as the word is in the brain and she has the mind of christ it has to be coming to maturity no maturity to catch the main of cars make what could give that mind is supreme a mountain but iran says knowing what an home jesus had to supreme anointing upon him and when this anointing came upon him the spirits upon me he went and sit down with all that glorious anointing he had break up the church here mash up the bench here swing on any channel air he was just sat down because the supreme an item is knowing what an how is the mind of christ the intelligence of god to know what the spirit wants done Oh glory to God hallelujah she does it in his name for she has dust yet the Lord you mean a bribe we loved us a lot exactly Oh My she then it is Gemma ties so the Holy Spirit waters it until it's grown and serve its purpose day in the bride do only his will no man no one can persuade them different this stubborn outside you will have what is stubborn somebody said do this do this do this this stubborn hallelujah no one can persuade him differently they have dust said the Lord or the keep still they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his deeds all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not kind yet then he said let us not like just one killer watch and it was nearing time to be given and Joshua means Savior represent the end time leaders they take this is over Caleb represent the true believer who stayed with Joshua watch God started Israel as a vision with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day Church how God is not moved Israel until its own appointed time so when people find God time taken too long people say this is the time they give me interpretation and has some spooky spirit India will come and whisper something in the air the confirmed TL vision of what the time is using named imaginable so that way I get false interpretation false manifestations false prophecy and false revelation to interpret what God is have a time appointed to interpret he said when the press come down watch it will pull them who a goddamn and manifest and to people and to the partner he said power is a character oh god I just showed power like crazy tell everybody to vindicate some guy revelation Lakia the power God moving them yeah yeah character where's the evidence every test he lost his wife he lost his health he's got an accident he almost died what he has he gone to has he gone to a place of trying all these are things have to be designed because character is not a gift I'm I'm preaching as a gift gifts I'm calling is without repentance I might get have a gift a minister and preach a weapon and have no character whatsoever so God is not vindicating gifts that's why I'd option is the right cleaner son not the right kind of sermon but the right and a son so you could preach your own sermon by delight that you live and become adopted because : adopting the sermon or the message he had adopted a son right kindness son or give the lot some praises or glory to God hallelujah see on your wing so he said no watch no matter how much people said God give us the land let's go and take it they might have said just really love the Commission you're washed up why not do it something he said thus says the Lord in a moment and that was the will of God but this wise God sent prophets knew the promise of God but also new to wait for that it's not only to test to know the promise you know but - no - wait he said wait till them seven thunders to the voices to that group what they will do if a man come and say well is here now it oughta forces and bring this revelation a revolution but I know what is he it was slice em cut it s they could bring more revelations before he said speaking things that is your interpretation when the blast the mountain Bora Burnham said those brothers are wrong and heard the blasts but hear a voice did you get that the bread room with brother branham hood the mountain blossom treat and past but he heard a voice judgment striking west coast there Mooney was a noise but he had a voice Alaska almost sunk Oh hallelujah praise God I went Jesus a device thundered but he was God speaking it handed whenever God speak at unders Oh glory that God but he was speaking to his son God going to speak to you see when the time come God give it a Joshua who has stayed with him by the word for he could trust others he could not trust him it will repeat so he could trust Joshua Carter some other guys oh my hallelujah so God where does he turn out and God being infinite kind of speak one ting and change it to something else to make a better decision because every decision God make is perfect once his word is spoken it can never die it must live on so when God purpose to call you in for he call he can change back that : you can run you can hide you can duck he can change the calling upon your life you have to be called because all he foreknew he called you have to new you know you before in order to call you and we call you justified you have to just define you you have to clean up your act you have to clean up your record and your history that's what he does we call it justified we justify it done passed already he already glorified so you in a project now to go to your process knowing you're justified knowing your glory side you're in between here the devil is a big liar tonight you can't give up you can't let go your turn back sight did not put and let will not know you're too late devil this thing is sealed inside of me I've been sealed by the word I'm waiting to be sealed by the spirit okay the Lord a shout I've been sealed like a revelation now within the be sealed at your spirit the Lateran is fixin to fall or glory of God your rubbers in a sealed your room is sealed you can I receive an x-man seed or chlorine accord because I have received a seed the secret is the weather's of the bride or you are pregnant with God tonight Oh hallelujah oh God thank you Lord and kill order so therefore his decision might be perfect once he says something it has to go all with a judgment if the church has the voice of God and you must get as part of the church but there are so much difference only doctrines so - my opinion the voice of God is the judge so the voice of God is so perfect it's got to come from a perfect resource nassau baram look let me say it kind of feel because it is god it can feel these prophets knew it it can't feel will come from a perfect resource this god is the one who bring in the inspiration who only men move by the spirit spoke as the Spirit gave them utterance Oh glory love what are you at me now with my faith in the word like that I cannot take some private interpretation for the Bible states that the Bible is of no private interpretation he said no display just revealed that so he's preaching and things on fooling Jesse can take me to protect me by let's see he's pretty big nothing ok let's go down now even in the Word of God God is absolutely on a bone the God who is the function of all honor who is the beginning of all honor who is the source of all honor who is the source of all truth has got to stand by what he said Oh glory to God when he come down and call Moses by the burning bush he's up come down because I need the christ of my people and I come down on you going let my people go you said Moses was a smart guy he's the Lord who shall I said suddenly because you know people you know that work I kind of come and see I come in the world with who shall I see sent me horses because they tell them I am that I am sin you Oh hallelujah I can call you mémé just tell them I am hallelujah this God this discord that have no name this is it God they have no name all glory to God the god of Moses the god of Isaac the God of Jacob the court of Abraham the quarter have no name oh he said bring them to this mountain I'm gonna give them my Lords Oh hallelujah I want to unveil my mystery I'm so mysterious I want to chop up some laws at least ago understand how I they'll behave he said put a mock around there don't let that animal cross there any animal cross that no must be killed a comment down on that mountain I wonder predict him didn't Mountain and the fire came down on the horn mati began to shake the people's had a tremble because it was the atmosphere oh god it's so fearful oh my oh hallelujah then the people say don't let God speak let moves you speak don't let that supernatural no internal fire and judgment and trumpets and don't let that happen that Moses speak God say okay I'm gonna send prophets fear or the lightning and thunders in the form of a voice did you get that all that trumpet all that noise all that shaking all that thunder you wrap it up in a voice Tom this voices who is a source of truth then this is if this isn't gold wood and who is God where is cord or D is there God where I'm talking all that is no he said quoting from Revelation chapter 22 if I testify to every man that is priest Pope Bishop state prospector that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add these things God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written into this book now is a nice contraction don't don't take away this call author of the Bible if you add any place here and see something God did you see them trying to be the own God when you said it talk for God like that is like youuuu own God what about dogmas what about only on Scripture creature listen to of all the emotions there's not one an excuse if any man shall take away from the words seen it look the same you know worth of the prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and the things written in that book the air for though he is a preacher all his life though he be a bishop a pope whosoever shall take one word just one more not one word not a word but just one word do you realize was one would be noted one spoken would have God he's daughter to be the truth it caused every sickness every disease every suffering baby every hospital to be built every operation performed every death never died is because of one word you've got to take it away god spoke it and don't mix it with nothing it has to be God said so hallelujah is it after a while the thunders answer why your sign was written first it's not written but you're saying much written after life it has to be in the world seven seas in the book seven seas on the back of the book then the prophets showed that you can have it and the back of the book he take the seven seas on the back which of those funders I sided inside the book under the Seventh Seal put it on us right inside our there so it's not fourteen seals it's still seven seals Oh give the Lord some previous people our lawyer seven seas ready with him seven seas on the outside hallelujah praise God or glory of God but what was on the outside came from me insane or Korena got a closed book a sealed book no man wait and look on it but no that book is open and the brightest challenge to go to the angel and say give me that book oh that book I want that book you have to see your name in that book your authorities in that book your blessing in that book Oh glory to God amen so therefore the sea can only be reproduced by its original Breeden life can only reproduce by its original Breeden if it's the hybrid it cara produces itself all glory to God but the hybrid brings a super crop a bumper crop that's why they have super corn and super tomato and super nice and super that hybrid stuff is not right when a crop of falsehood depth I read a corner bring forth a big crop a better crop better-looking but it is dead planted back and carry but reduce itself if produce a hybrid crop and Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom didn't hook on a man be born again when his old can he entered in the second time in his mother's womb and be born he say except a man be born of water and spirit he can enter the kingdom this is the bottom is that a seed every spoken word I've got is a seed that's right I'm gonna prove it in a minute Jesus said every spoken word of God is a seed every spoken word of God is a seed so when you hear the spoken word you are getting and Jesus first parable was a kingdom of God was a man who went and so and chose seed and some fell on the wayside some fell among rocks some fell among bones some fellow good wrong Oh glory to God the west side of birds come and take it away hallelujah they hear it and just blow away the rocks it's spring of our giant chocolate fish service and disappear after a while hallelujah fell among thorns plunger rock around them and chop them they bring no fruit to perfection what some fell on good ground nothing wrong with the seed check the ground the seed is the word the seed is his seed and have to bring for his time if it's fall in the right ground or give the Lord some praises right wrong is the right atmosphere have to have an atmosphere but I see the trouble inside or chlorine apart I wanted found a good round in port for some 60 for some hunter fall but I'm gonna bring fort or glory of God Alleluia is not the quick jump and up and down noise who's grounded who is in the atmosphere whose and controls that that's he could grow and prosper because he bringing forth fruit Oh glory to God my mom says oh my hallelujah praise God praise God please good thank you Jesus so if we transform it to be changed its to be mean different from what it was it's correct and everything has to be changed it was a lying mire with a smoker with a drinker god transform yo you can't be smoking drinking again it's a change you being change them until you have to keep changing one day your body itself could be changed it's a big changer not just an inside change afterwards your your body can handle what on the inside it's rapture Peroni inside and when the sleeping since appear for 30 40 years that could be a jamming on your body again because your faith will be super anointed when you see them sleeping Saints people that you know in the theophany coming to visit you the let you know the always upon you for this resurrection power what can it happen Oh glory to God you will have the confidence and the faith to believe you'll be changing the very atoms in the moment you think of a name well glory to God the chump of course have strong dedication ERISA or that is what the Prophet said they're going to appear the scripture had it many of the scenes arose and appealing to many we all let us seize the day and going on give a bounce back they will come back or glory the core because the cripton power that's already in you will be quicker than all deliverance because the bride is the magnet the plan is a capstone a headstone there were no bullets on the grill it's just this body after we change but we have a scripture disruption we'll put on incorruption this mortal puts on immortality and we shall be changed or we are scripture tonight a shift of transformation or glory or gonna rupture in scripture a change in Scripture or Gloria gonna turn a car knowing that Jesus went back in there Kripke I say I shall not suffer a Holy One see corruption Jesus went back in that scripture and anointed that scripture so close to the graves and you knew this try this buddy and Trina's I wanna raise it up he knew your scripture you've got to know your scripture or kill the Lord I show em Jesus was rested on what David said we are resting on it yeah resting on Garcia the Lord glory man change change I'm almost done what I give you Anthony Oh glory transforming power from the inside out rapture power from the inside out not tell a soul after your spirit II I don't need one more door up there buddy Oh hallelujah you said what I said after your soul after your spirit and only the rough change the body Oh hallelujah another body forming around his inside buddy he's inside man or change inside idea fire on the inside and fire coming around me on the outside and your body and body in between Oh glory to God thank you lord that's transforming power of God takes something that's nothing I make something wonderful out of it Oh glory to God now in 6,000 years he's everything is perfect he commanded each one of those seeds watch that they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the word spoken should be it was an oak tree it become an oak it was a palm it was a bring forth a pound because the great creator has just sent his word and the word seed was deer before the real seat was formed so when God said let there be a oak tree that was the word bo clea form yet but from that word for man real walk okey so when he said let there be a bride and trinidad there's a word but then that would go on punku and i knew i have you had a real seed of that would do you understand that let her be a super church that's how word seeded but that had to be manifested every seed will bring forth and the power is here the chance from his seed the preferred is cream his pain the kind of God loves many many many or glory of God don't change the nature bring forth this kind will be a pollutant in topple poetry if your palm tree everything after is kind oh my I remember to bring when we put the scene in the earth I'm almost done the sea can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from see the plant so when you put the seed in there is power in the seed if the sea could only talk the season took the desk if the secret only talk is he can put it on put it on I'm I don't pull it on I don't want to be on top the desk I don't want to be on top of stone put they in the grown what me down put me down stop time in your hand put me in the ground I'll perform if you put Manila well I'm gonna write I'm going to die I'm with the brick fort I'm going to break out and you're gonna see what's inside of me because it's a power inside of me it's a silent it is sealed it is colored until the coin the right grown or kill the Lord I shock if the sea can only talk tonight put me in that girl and I'm gonna come for you said if it steered in the right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be because he had made it at me and me the channel but anything that stays in that channel in the line of his world would have to bring for exactly as its kind oh my my mind and he went on and talked about of seats and the spring spring with deform policy deform sons Shh but Jesus had a repellent or Chloe that God we have something that she was a thing called guru mousse when it was on my country something is a kind of grease thing you put on your body and think for musket water still over you like I do like he smell it and things so it's Priya cellphones Priya socks and spray etching and then my schedule atmosphere that is a repellent that you use him like a set as a bear repellent for mosquito repellent for sin and Satan attacks which is the word of God and the Holy Ghost a repellent notice go to a seat of this wood and there's only one thing I could quick in the world one thing that is the spirit oh my for it is a life-giver to the word and when the life in the word miss the life of the Spirit it produces whatever the seed is when the life of the world so the word is having my life so it's not as a dead dead dead dead you know there's a word seed Peter was custody a son denying Christ but the other seasons out of him not like the Saturday and the spirit water was gone informing upper room nowhere else but in the upper room so he's a tyranny see Jerusalem until you be endued perform a high because go honey mana no power is heavenly power not Bishop our non almighty preacher power this is heavenly power and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they went one man they wanna call all of a sudden there was a stone from heaven and suddenly tongues of fire appeared each one of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost they were filled with a different spirit altogether they will feel the Holy Ghost and we find out that the Holy Ghost is the word god help me tonight you'll find out that the Holy Ghost is the same word that Jesus put unto them the same seed but them to them it turned into power or you cyrusi power after the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ones come to activate the ceilings had are you get the Lord a shout or blow either the Holy Spirit transform the season that's on the inside of it I'm just read it the Holy Spirit transform the season that's inside of you all glory oh god I'm frozen no matter what kind of seed it is it will transform it if it as evil it before evil if it's super good
