tonight come into your word speak to our hearts take me out of the way and may you be glorified in our midst in Jesus name we ask it amen God bless you and it's a privilege to be here honored to be here in local Christian Assembly praise God original Church in London amen so brother Peter God bless you your wife Family Church I've known him from as he said many many years with many friends and uh it's first time here and I'm I'm I'm I'm blessed so I'd like you to turn your Bibles to two portion of scripture 2 Kings chapter 2 and Revelation chapter 10 first scripture reading tonight I just came up from Aban we had such Mighty meetings I've never been into a convention what we saw in Aban I Coast my son Isaac was preaching and he says he said that um in every war there's always a turning point it was for Hitler it was for Napoleon and it is for the devil a turning point when the enemy coming like a flood the spirit of God would raise up a standard there's always come a turning point you get this stress and that struggle and whatnot but there comes a time a season a day an hour where something just turns and there's nothing the enemy could do about it so when your hour come that your hour come they try to grab Jesus he said my hour is not yet come you can't take me before time but when my hour come my hour come and when your hour Deliverance come no devil could stop it when your hour breakthrough come nobody could stop it Hallelujah so we are breaking into something now let's read from second Kings chapter 2 verse1 it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind but Elijah went to Elisha from gigal Elijah said unto Elisha T here I pray thee for the Lord had sent me to beel Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to beel and the sons of the prophets that what Bethel came forth to elishah said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today he say yeah I know it hold ye your peace Elijah said unto him Elisha T here I pray thee for the Lord had sent me to Jericho he said as the Lord liveth as I saw liveth I will not leave thee so they went they came to Jericho and the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elijah and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from my head today he said yeah I know it hold ye your peace Elijah said unto him T I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and as he said as the Lord liveth as I so liveth I will not leave thee and they twoo went on and 50 of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view a far off and they stood by Jordan Elijah took his mantle wrapped it together and smok the waters and they were divided hither and thither so they both two went on one dry ground came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from the it shall be so unto day but if not it shall not be so it came to pass and as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire horses of fire parted them Bo aunder Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the child of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took a hold of his own clothes and rent them into two pieces he took also the man of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoked the waters and said where is the the Lord God of Elijah and then when he also had smitten the waters dep parted hither and thither and Elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah that rest on Elisha and they came to meet him and bow themselves to the ground before him one last scripture Revelation 10 8-1 we read and and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word come and interpret it to our hearts confirm it with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated praise God oh blessed be the name of the Lord I know what Peter said could take my time but I'm not going to take my time I wouldn't keep you long but I have something that I want to share with you I have a title the title is like a shout is not a title that you could really read to say well you know is a title but the title is where is the Lord God of Elijah that's my title where is the Lord God of Elijah have an inspiration you shall return from across Jordan you shall return in power I'm here tonight to prophesy the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy The Voice told John go to the angel notice not go to a man go to the angel and say give me that book that book John represented the bride he said take it and eat it and if you take it and eat it something going to happen to you you're going to prophesy now you only prophesy before it happens you only prophesy because there's a time period where the word has to go forth it give the critics time to criticize it give the Devils to laugh and Mock and everything else in that period of Prophecy you're waiting on God it's a time of lingering Hallelujah but you have a testimony it's the testimony of Jesus it's not a testimony of a group it's not a testimony of a man it's not a testimony of a church it's a testimony of Jesus that's the Revelation John got on the Isles of pmos was the testimony of Jesus and when Jesus G them the promise you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you he said You shall shall be a witness unto me to the alls the end of the Earth he never said you shall be witness unto a group onto a church unto a system unto a denomination he said You shall be Witnesses unto me so we want to get one thing clear at the end of it all you'll be Witnesses of Jesus at the end of it all you're going to be like Jesus you're going to walk like him you're going to talk like him you're going to act like him you're going to be like like him oh glory to God that's the promise of the Father the promise of the father is the holy ghost coming upon your life oh Hallelujah notice I did not say that you will cross Jordan I already see you go across and come back I am seeing you coming back from Crossing Jordan Jordan represents death death to self death to your pride Jordan represent dying out we G Beyond you dying out you going to die out and come back oh glory to God you will return in power don't let the devil tell you otherwise oh Hallelujah god promise it and God will not lie Hallelujah glory to God oh praise the name of the Lord so therefore this inspiration you shall return from across Jordan you shall return in power is from the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy he said blessed are they that which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb he said unto me this Revelation uh 9 199 he said unto me these are the true saints of God and I fell at his feet to worship Him He said unto me see thou do it not in other words don't worship any man I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren which the testimony of Jesus worship God so under the testimony of Jesus you must worship God when Jesus opened the understanding to the scriptures when Jesus opened the word to them they then had Jesus testimony with the Breath of God upon them reing the Holy Ghost and with that testimony they went in the upper room and they were worshiping God every service was a worship worship shpping have nothing to do with what God could do for you whether he do it or he don't do it he still deserve the worship he still deserve the glory so when you get a revelation of having the testimony of Jesus it is time to worship Oh Glory to God and the worshiping create the atmosphere for Revival the worship and create the atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to worship and create the atmosphere for your breakr and Deliverance praise God you're not just to look at me you yet to enter in because Jesus has come Among Us the son of man has been revealed the son of man has been revealed you have a revelation oh Hallelujah Elijah have come Among Us and he brought a vision Oh Glory to God you may be seated Elisha represented the bride that's right and that Prophet came and did something for him he P the mantle and pulled it off I like that he didn't give him manle and say go on no he took it and pull it off and that pull off give him a thirst give him a desire give him a passion to know the word give him a cry to get in the spirit give him a f desire to please God that put something in that young man Hallelujah a vision broke on him and when a vision breaks on you nothing could stop you stay here where no way I see something if you see me go hard to see something to get it you have to see it oh give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God you just just come to church and go back home you got to see something and Elijah saw something as the Lord live it I will not going to leave you I'm not going to stay at Jericho I'm not going to stay at Bethel I'm not going to stay at justification I'm not going to stay at sanctification I'm not going to stay at the bapm Holy Ghost I'm going to go to Faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness I'm going all the way Seven Virtues seven tunders seven voices I'm going all the way I'll be sealed with the book oh hallelujah hallelujah that's a man with Vision nothing could throw him off the school of the prophets telling him your master be taken he said I know it hold your peace and would shut up there are men that God tell the Prophet The Prophet said stay here and they stay right there they said the prophet say stay here and they moving they're still dead to this day because they have no vision Vision give you Revelation Vision inspiration it give you faith it give you a passion it give you an enthusiasm it's giv you a goal it's giving you want to achieve that's what it did oh Hallelujah if they don't have it you're going to get it you can't stay where you are we got to Cross Jordan and come [Applause] back Glory Hallelujah the Bible said Jesus returned in the power of the spirit hallu after overcoming the Devil by it is written it is written it is written he was just taking the word and telling the devil like it is give the Lord a shout of Praise he was proving to the devil that we can overcome by the word itself they overcome by the word of God and by their testimony oh give the Lord a shout of Praise you're going to have a testimony not of failure not of shortcoming but you're going to prophesy the book has been open this book is [Applause] open it's not a closed Vision it's an open Vision this book is open we could go anywhere in the book The Mystery has been unfolded the mystery has been revealed it's an open book oh Hallelujah glory to God no man could come now after 40 plus years years of the days of the voice no man could come with some new revelation to bring some kind of sensation not when the mighty Angel the one with the sweat back Wings the one with the seven seal not when that Mighty Angel come down with the book open there's a bride in London come on Hallelujah there's a bride around the world a bride with an open Vision not a closed vision not a church Vision but an open Vision that come from the open book you shall return in [Applause] power hallelujah hallelujah glory to God not a open not a closed Vision an open Vision there's so many churches today and people today and ministers today trying to have a closed Vision you have to come to hear them you have to go to this church to make the Rapture you even have to hear this song to make the Rapture you have to sing this song to make the Rapture you have to read this man to make the Rapture so the foolishness has nothing to do with vision of God has nothing to do with vision of god notice the test for Elisha wasn't Jericho and betel you know no the test was Jordan notice when they Cross Jordan the first thing Elijah said ask what you will now that you overcome ah now that you're going past yourself come on now now you are in the position you're supposed to be in come on now you could ask that young man asks for double portion I feel we have a problem tonight we not asking we ask him too easy we want to disturb God tonight when you finish ask God must say ask a hard thing we we want to trouble Heaven tonight praise God we want to ask we want to expand our asking expectation come on now you want more than a blessing we could take a Revival tonight you you want you want want healing we can take some Miracles yet tonight come on now come on now glory to God we can take s Mark 16 s John 14:12 same works I do shall you do also yes we can have more tonight ask what you will oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah may be seated this old man Elijah this young man Elisha boat at Jordan I love that how R phrase that boat standing on Jordan the old man looking to go home the young man looking to get a vision and that young man dare asks for adoption he dare asks a super Church a super race he he D ask for all these Mighty turple promises that man said give me a double portion I want one for for my soul and I want one for my body Oh Glory to God I want the inside and I want a portion for the outside I'm going to be leaving here there's going to be a Rapture I want Power for my soul I want Power for my body this Mortal will put on immortality we are going to be changed this whole wrinkle body going to be changed all the gray hair will get back black the bald head will get back here we are getting out yeah oh remember the first man God made wasn't the flesh man the first man God made was the spirit man that was the man that was in charge the spirit man God put the spirit man on the earth then God formed Man Out of the Dust and put Spirit man in the dust man so the spirit man was controlling dust man what you think God bringing back God bringing back Spirit man to control dust man power oh power over self power over the lust of the eyes power over the lust of the flesh power of the pride of like God promise [Music] it we are going back to Eden friends Oh Glory Hallelujah man I'll have to to come back to [Applause] London look it look like we have some unfinished business what a p I'm having myself a time this is brother brandham from God in Simplicity you know I have it here greetings I have me greeted people be all right and brother Jessie Roo sends greeting also amen but this is Brother BR from God in Simplicity Elijah humbled himself and stated with what God Said in such a way that it pleased God to take the Same Spirit from Elijah that he promised to shove it three times down the road from here he sure did he promised that it would come and it will come upon Elijah his successor and then come on John the Baptist and according to Malachi 4 it's to be here in the last day God loved that spirit that was upon that simple uneducated Woodsman what we was so edent to his word he would say Elijah do this Elijah would do it and God hid himself in there in such Simplicity but one day here we go when he got old his bald head his Whiskers hanging down gray a few years he had hanging over his shoulders his little old skinny arms the meat flopping on them like that come walking down the road of Samaria them eyes look up towards dis Skies with a crooked stick in his hand he wasn't very much to look at but he had dust sayth the Lord he didn't stammer with it he didn't stutter now great Ahab he walked up and said not even D would fall from Heaven till I call for it God had honored his Simplicity now watch now you see while it was in the simple way and everybody was against him all the ministers Association and everything else was at his throat trying to get rid of him and everything else but in that Simplicity even though he had no cooperation with his campaigns and whatever more they had everybody thought he was a crank God was hiding himself and when it come time here we go for that seed to get ripe that has been planted God manifested himself by sending fire out of heavens and licking up the sacrifice God hiding his implicity and then revealing himself again now we find out he promised these things the trouble is today with so many of us we want to get so Seminary and denominational educated minded that God can't use us God can give a man a St to do something give him a Ministry the first thing you know he will go to catering for what others say and the first thing you know he'll be wrapped up in a bunch of stuff and then God just takes his hand off of him and let him alone and the man still preaching man still teaching but God hands off of him because God want to talk directly with his sons he don't want Mary and Joseph or any intercessor in between he said let us make man have dominion and put that man in Garden of Eden and every evening God talk with him God didn't have a bishop over him to tell him to tell Adam something when God want to talk to Adam he know where Adam is hallelujah hallelujah he could find Adam and God could find you God have your email address God have your cell phone number I God have your telephone God know exactly where you living but brandom said your street number is so and so your house number is so and so God know just where to find you oh give the Lord a shout [Music] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so praise God so listen where there's a no vision the people perish and the vision comes by a prophet so brother R brought a prophetic Vision that all of us have to plug into because that book is what was given to the prophet he didn't have the book himself the lamb had was to take the book when William brandham did not take the book from the angel the angel cried who is worthy to take the book because the book have to be taken not beg oh God book the book God they say cry for the book you have to take the book who is willing to take it that's to take with authority you can't go without Authority for the book you know could I have the book please the book wouldn't move so there's one time you can't be waiting you're waiting for the book no the book not coming The Voice didn't say wait for the book The Voice said take the book you have to start to read the word you have to study the word you have to go in the word you have to open your spoken word book you have to take it and eat it don't chew it like chewing gum no eat it let it go down let it digest sweeten the mouth bitten the belly but you're going to begin a prophesy I'm going to be delivered I'm going to be healed I'm going to have a miracle I'm going to get a breakthrough praise God I'm going to breakthrough on the job I'm going to get a breakthrough in my house my marriage going to get a breakthrough my daughter going to get a breakthrough my son going to get a breakthrough what you doing you're prophesying come on say Amen somebody I'm going to be filled with God I'm going to be filled with the Holy Ghost what you doing you prophesying oh Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah [Music] oh blessed be the name of the Lord so without a vision the people perish isn't that right blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah so when Elijah cross over Elijah told him if you see me go you you got to stay focused don't let nobody throw you off don't let your job your husband your wife your children don't let family nothing must CH the vision because you must know what you want Hallelujah he wanted that double portion he said if you see me go you'll have it if not you can't have it you have to see it to get it isn't that right glory to God Amen now but said Jesus the disciples didn't have perfect Faith because they had Christ with them he said because now the promise was Christ to be in them as long as Christ is with them they couldn't have that perfect fi fate but remember they had power Jesus give them power to heal the sick to raise the Dead cast out devils he said they had power not the faith to use the power there's the brandham Tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got faith to move it now Elijah this end time 20th century Prophet has already been Vindicated spoken word power over nature over tumor we know it don't have to say sels Let There Be it has already been demonstrated when God take B Bram of the scene the power didn't move God didn't remove the power God leave a message that will produce a faith to unlock the heavens like Elijah then to call for the power then so God going to raise up some sons in the last days ah with d Fai not not a Fai because Malachi for came to turn our hearts back to D Fai of the father so as we head down to destination like you're driving on the highway you're going somewhere unless you're just making circles you're heading to a destination the destination is the faith seven tunders give faith is it's something to be done it's something to receive we have a destination we have to pick up the faith first then to go forward we have to go back to what Peter had to what the early church had then we could talk about the change of the body because they had defate they had the Holy Ghost itself they had adoption but the bodies couldn't be changed because the fullness of time was not yet but we are approaching the closing time of the Gentiles we are approaching the fullness of time where the faith have to connect with the power to change this body so there it is the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't have faith to move the power here I got I'll skip that oh praise with a heart full of joy you walk into a sick room knowing exactly what you're going to say you walk in there and you say thust hear the Lord there you are a perfect Fai Hallelujah so this Vision that brother brandham has been restored that's Vision that's what he released he released a vision and the vision is for an appointed time we can't Jer it we can't manufacture it the vision is always for appointed time but we wait on it but we have a vision the vision give us an anchor the vision giv us an attitude because that's what Elijah had he had an attitude don't tell me we stay here no I have somewhere to go I'm on my way to Perfection I'm on my way to the I'm somewhere I'm going I'm not staying here well you're getting old that doesn't stop me because Caleb said I was young now I'm old isn't that right he said what I'm just as strong when I first started off isn't that right so age have nothing to do with it it's the fight that's inside of you say if you don't have that fight tonight we come to give you that fight then the devil is in trouble say oh sister so and so start to pray some more now she's had to fight back Hallelujah fight back Hallelujah tell somebody he will fight back just turn around tell somebody to fight back Glory Glory Hallelujah we going to fight back we going to fight back with faith we going to fight back with forgiveness we going to fight back with love we can to fight back with Grace we will fight back all right last page I'm done to be [Music] continued all right so therefore okay so Elijah uh came down to Jordan and Jordan is dead the thing that will really kill us is brotherly kindness where we have to die we have to say I'm sorry forgive me it's a is a cross that we have to bear but that's the age requirement that we in who would love the Brethren who would be committed to it isn't that right so brotherly carish is a killer they have to say it wrong people like say they wrong they want to be right all the time it takes power to repent is take power to say I'm sorry to power to say I'm wrong we need that kind of power it strips you of yourself yeah I made a mistake I really fail God I struggle I'm struggling we like to talk how strong we are but we have to strip ourselves to see that God want to break us down that we needy of him totally I'm closing I want to bring a testimony from um from from IV coast and the thing of it is when Elijah got the mantle all the time you looking at his mantle and this mantle whoa because you see afterwards Elijah is so anointed that Jordan know what to do when he hit it Elijah didn't stand about D Jordan don't knowest I'm a servant of God part left part right no that talk is not necessary he didn't need to verbalize that he took his mantle strike it and Jordan know a king is coming a son is coming a Son of God is coming Adam is coming and next Adam one like Adam is coming now watch Elisha was going from son to become a manifested son all the critics who standing a far off because they're not coming near they're viewing a far off they're looking to see when you're coming back they're not sure where you're going oh that's good that's good that's good sorry sorry I'm getting excited they're not sure where you're going they think you're stumbling and fumbling but you know where you're going ah but they will recognize when you come back [Music] so when Elijah crossed with Elisha they say man he gone he gone off he he gone he he he was he leave the inspiration he was he leave the message he was he leave that time is a private roomall God get his servant aside apart he got the mantle and recognized the power not in the mantle you have all the books all the tapes he said but I wanted all the message all the time I have all the books I have all the tapes but where's the power ah when he recognized nothing moving there was one thing left where is the Lord God of Elijah and tonight we don't ask for where is some man some man of the hour because brother brandham said no Minister could bring a Revival if the ministers could have bring it we should have had it a long time ago oh give the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] what we need is a cry where is the Lord God of Elijah that's my title here tonight we had some meetings in I coach just come back from and every service are going higher and higher but I want to talk about the last service Johnny Brother Johnny country from my uh from s Leone preach that message and was such an anointing and such an atmosphere there's no way to describe it but I saw something I been looking out for and I know is a sign of what we're going to see happening he was on a platform walking in front and brothers was trying to grab him at his foot grab him by his pants grab he had to pull back when he leave the pulpit to leave to go off the platform he had to run back up because they was trying to grab him that was the anointing that was just flying off it was awesome it was as if the Lord witness a change to the ministry of the spirit because we have a promise of that we have over been over 40 plus years under the ministry of the word under the ministry of Prophecy but it must turn because Dynamics has been here you know in the form of the spirit of Prophecy because God couldn't release Dynamics as Dynamics if we're not ready for it so we can only read Dynamics as promise so Jesus breathed upon them receive the Holy Ghost he released upon them the promise but they have to wait until the day of Pentecost has fully come then when the day of pente was ful come it was manifested listen to this quote and I close with this from God call man brother brh notice the man being a plow boy before God made his name Immortal all the prophets that stood around watching him had to bow to his feet because he had the power of God upon him there's here the prophecy now I'm leaving you with this there's coming an hour when God shall make the world bow at the feet of men and women who have plunged through and crossed Jordan separating themselves from the things of the world brother sister tonight whatever you do whatever you think you cross Jordan with God go on over separate the World Behind get God trained in your own service we are living in before this revival but God is searching out trying to find Hearts Let's bow our heads as we want to pray father God I

devil and God is rejoicing because the young people pack the energy pack the fire and I'm so happy for that and you know brother ID was speaking about uh where is the Lord God of Elijah and as a young person I'm not as young as I used to be but I I'm still young um it is a reality for us to reached the point where it's not just about coming to church anymore but it's looking for the living reality of the Living God and brother Brandon preach a message the unfailing realities of the Living God and many young people we're holding on we we we know it's right we know it's real but we know the devil is bringing everything that he got against us I want to encourage you hold on Don't Let Go don't give up the devil has nothing on you and greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world the the reason you have so many trials so many tests so many ups and down is because the devil knows that there's something in you he doesn't know what it is but he knows that there's something about you you are a mystery to the devil you are a mystery to this world the world will never understand you because you come from God and you're going back to God there's a promise over you and no devil could stop it so may the Lord richly bless you with the channel God bless you your wife the ministry the church let's just bow our heads one once more our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we are so privileged tonight to be in your presence to have this Lord opportunity to gather Lord there'll come a day and time when we wouldn't be able to gather like this so we cherish every moment father where we could have Fellowship one with another under your shed blood because your Prophet told us Lord is only under the shed blood we could have Fellowship father may you bind us together Lord may your Holy Spirit go with us may the words that were spoken tonight Lord return 100 full may it find a good resting place in our souls may you bless brother over for the word that was said and give him strength in his body may you be with each one Lord that's here tonight those that may have been connected and those that would hear the tape Lord we commit everyone into your hands Grant traveling mercies to everyone in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen may the Lord richly bless you the wind is blowing again God bless you again the wind is blowing again just like the day of P the wind is again windowing again the wind is again like the day of P the wind is blowing again the fire is Falling Again is fall again just like the is Falling Again wind go [Music]
