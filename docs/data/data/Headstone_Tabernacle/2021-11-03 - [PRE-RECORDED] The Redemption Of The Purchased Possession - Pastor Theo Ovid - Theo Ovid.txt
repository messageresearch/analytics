[Applause] [Music] oh let's give the lord a shout out praise this morning hallelujah oh glory [Applause] hallelujah well how many on the great expectation this morning i am i am on a great expectation to see what the lord will do among us because he promised to come among us promises speak to our hearts to minister to needs our needs and that's what we come here for to get our souls ministered and to reign amen so before we get into the service that we have for you this morning i want to just share a few thoughts with you from the prophet's message question and answers with the brahma god has a hard time trying to get somebody that he could deal with that will stay humble and meek and stay in the place until god calls him to do something you believe that see a man that god can bless and he will still keep himself a man and not be an angel or a god as soon as a man gets blessed and has a little there's a little something given to him i'm like oh but random freezer a little something just just a little something given to him he wants to be a god he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person what i do me me mine all that that's the wrong attitude god's hunting for somebody who we could bless pour out the blessings and the more he is blessed the littler the man will become and you will never get more of god until you become nothing you have got to belittle yourself he that will exalt himself god will bring a beast and he will humble himself god will exalt you have got to get little before you can get big and you will never be big in your own self you will be only as big as god will be big in you how could we give the lord a shout on that one and this is from says this is the time this is a sign of the answer now i do not believe that there is anything that he has spoken all these years of my life that i have spoke to the people but what come to pass now many people have come with dreams and he would let me by his grace interpret for the people many has come with dreams and with problems that i was unable to interpret and i haven't tried to introduce to you people a gimmick that has all the answers i'll try to be honest to tell you what was truth and i could only tell you as he told me and then as it come to me i could tell you and i want to warn you in this day that we are living in not saying anything against people but when you see a man when you see a person that's got and the answer to everything that's contrary to the word the amen song enlighten that one i want it to be clear this is not gimmick thing we we have all the answers no no no no i want to warn you he said when you see a person that got the answer to everything that is contrary to the word jesus said there were many lepers in the days of elijah but only one was healed in the many years the eighth year more that elijah lived one leper was healed many windows in the days of elijah he was only center one and we find out that there are many things that god does that he doesn't reveal to his servants i'm not hearing you i want to hear a bigger iman than that many thing that god does that he does not reveal to his servant and no servant is greater than his lord and god will not share his glory with nobody he is god oh give the lord a shout in the house and when a servant comes to a place he tries to take the place of god something that will do that you know the plain god then god takes his life and moves him away somewhere or something we must remember that so i trust that these few things will edify you because that's what you're kept here for and defy you and we could be judged by the word because every gift going to be judged every man is going to be judged all of us going to be judged by the word oh hallelujah so we're not trying to compare ourselves with william branham and his experience like years ago there was a brother used to preach all kind of things he was sitting and preach preach for two hours not preach really talk talk they were talkers in those days and he said brother branham uh melt a cigarette pack and a forest and pressure man called thinking man's filter so he can meet a fan he can meet a box of matches he could meet anything and be assuming from that so all of them playing mini profit they could just take a word and get an experience and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk so you find out that i am not interested in those side shows i call them those experiences that belong to brother branham and here's why you have to look at listen carefully not so much the prophet you know but the prophet's prophecy let me say that again not the prophet but the prophet's prophecy you see the prophecy said that they would stagger with and have on a lips staggering lips and tongues and so the prophecy said that now if you're watching jesus you can say jesus never stagger jesus ever speak in tongues and and fall along in the upper room and no no so you're watching jesus but you're not watching the prophecy what jesus fulfilled was his prophecy what is for you is your prophecy so you have to understand that the scriptures prophesy certain things to be fulfilled so it didn't prophesy we would be like brother branham have a hat and go and hunt and so on i'm not living in that kind of area and so on there's a scripture for you to be fulfilled isn't that right so you don't watch the just the prophet but you're what the prophet's prophecy what is to be here for this time look how much that mockery of brother branham for prophesying about the car shaped like an egg that you don't need steering wheel and it was controlled by some power look at all their muck and make fun and look how they have it right now at his normal normal normal normal but he said before the end science will increase so powerfully that they will create the car that don't need a steering wheel he saw people sitting in it and they were playing cars or playing games and whatnot and it was taking them to the destination but that's what they have now that's what they're coming up with now why we are nearing the end praise god he said before the end this is supposed to happen when we see it coming in front of us but nearing the end then there gonna be a bright revival why we are nearing him there's gonna be a super church of super race one we are nearing the end when the power of this church rises it will bring the brethren that we can hear in the end praise god may not feeling for fear we are near in the end russia coming in position we are nearing the end praise god hallelujah the power is moving in the church we are nearing the end the anointing going to get greater and greater move higher and higher why we are nearing the end there's got to be a people prepared why we are nearing the end god can't leave us in this state we can meet the challenger our in this tape something have to happen praise the name of the lord you you understand what i'm saying we had 50 years of this i'm you're not hearing what i'm saying this morning oh glory to god 50 years of mechanics mechanics teaching and preaching of the word we have to switch over the dynamics of the spirit to drive the people to calvary then into the rapture you're going to die you're going to rat you're going to travail you're going to groan your money can't take your hand neither your job or your rank or your post or your house or your car you need a rapture in faith to take you here you need the power to take it here [Applause] oh hallelujah with all your plans you're making make sure god in the center of all that plans oh give the lord a shout it's later down your tank the lamb is speaking like a dragon hallelujah and the prize hat the bride have to speak with the voice of god because the voice of god will be in the prayer the last days oh hallelujah praise god it's a shaken time you know let me be seated we're going to get in this scripture shortly but ram says when christ was going to calvary so much scripture has been fulfilled in such a short time you see it's dragged on but then when the wheel begins to turn its thing off the thing has to take happening praise god i'm telling you it'll be something else you know bomb some revival strikes sisters guys wash the dishes praise god have the problems upon your mind you wouldn't it wouldn't be no longer be a problem those petty little nonsense playing in your mind praise god but your all so fast all what you can overcome or what you can't jump over oh come on you got shake off praise god you will shake that off praise god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah glory hallelujah go give the lord a shout my my mouth hallelujah praise god you maybe see that praise god you have to experience walking with the word you have to experience that walking with their word god said so god saves you god said so you feel it yet touch it you ain't experience it but god said it god can't lie god another man that would lie if god sent a god big enough to keep it god promised it hallelujah he gonna keep it god set so i don't need a feeling to believe it god said it did god say oh hallelujah hallelujah satan that's what god said and then god said it that settles it don't tell me anything about it don't question me about it don't try to twist it here and twist it here leave it like it is it's just share the lord [Applause] enoch walked with god with mechanics with the word and god took him his mechanical dynamics that woman with a blood issue she told herself so my problems she first problem she had was a husband husband didn't want to go to that small church husband didn't want to hear that preacher called jesus making rap as it was on the outside of jerusalem but she pressed away husband didn't want to give enough money to get transportation she pressed away husband trying to discourage her you're not going to make it you're all dead you will die but she pressed oh wait the journey was hard because she had a bloody issue the ride was rough but she had a blood issue but that didn't stop her hallelujah because she was going somewhere she was getting somewhere she had a choice to stay home and die or move forward in faith to a man of god that was standing here she decided to move in faith hallelujah she told herself i don't want to waste my time going to church sitting in a pew somebody's got to tell yourself something she told herself he's like to just touch the helm of his gun and i know have you made all that he made whole i mean she told herself something you got to speak to yourself praise god when god is not even talking to you say something to yourself [Applause] oh give the lord a shout is there any shelters in your house you can tell yourself i'm gonna get a breakthrough today i'm gonna be healed today i'm gonna get a victory today i'm gonna raise above depression today i'm going to press out break out strike out today she didn't cater for the crowd and god will arrange it a lot of things that confront you and that you meet you you ain't cater for because some of you like to have your own way and you never cater for the opposition to how you think how you feel how you see it all you care is for you because you're selfish and it's all about you what you like what you want what you choose what you feel you're supposed to have how it's supposed to be it's all about you but with that woman she told herself if i could touch not if i send a letter out requesting a prayer request or doing that no if i could touch that means she had to get up from where she was she had to make movements to go with her testimony if i could touch she could knock somebody touch him for me touch him for me that's not working if i could touch what do you tell yourself this morning i'm the first hedgehog was the people big men strong men spiritual men men looking super spiritual dead men walking dead living the dead woman all types surrounding jesus part of the crowd set and god arranged like a backdrop of what are you going to do when you are determined when you are desperate and when you know this is your last ticket to get out of what you're in what you're going to do she pressed away i guess the first time it had to be rough to say somebody excuse me i have a mission to get the excuse me how to be rough to pat your way you know because it can't be easy all that crowd there nobody up in the room is jesus talking about this man who raising dead healing sick breaking bread and multiplying it to everybody around jesus he's popular everybody is talking about this man called jesus and she is just one of them but she was not just one of them she was one of them with a fate that spoke to herself that i have to get where no man went before after touch when nobody touched before i have to make scriptures that's how she was she was different different she was going to break she was going to break the barrier she was going to break whatever opposition whatever hindrance that she wanted to break out you know the story she pressed and pressed and pushed went below legs went above roll over she got her dress dirty but when she finally got to jesus she touched she did what she said and if you told yourself this morning i'm here to praise god i'm here to worship i'm here to glorify god because the worshiper once purged oh hallelujah you got to be a worshiper to be purged worshipper once perched no more remembrance hallelujah cleanse purge purify or could begin the lord i shout as we stand [Applause] praise the lord so this morning we want to go to ephesians 1 revelation chapter 5 scripture reading ephesians one one original verse three to fourteen version five within one to ten ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavy places in christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we shall be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had a bounty towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times you might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even him in whom also we have obtained here we go an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who look at all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also trusted after you hear the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed he was sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of all inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory revealing chapter 5 i want to read from verse 1 and i saw on the right hand of him that satan had thrown a book written within and on the backside c with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a lord voice who is worthy to open the book until lucas sees thereof and no one in heaven knowing it neither under the earth was able to open the book needed to look there on and i wept much because no one was found worthy to open and to read a book needed to look there on and and one of the elders said unto me reap not behold the land and the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seas thereof and i beheld them low in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the eldest to the lamb i had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne when he had taken the book the four beasts the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden fires full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying that what woody to take the book and to open the seas thereof for door was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth let's bow our heads with a prayer almighty god we thank you for your word we thank you for this book today that is still open oh jesus may you speak from that book may we hear from that book may each person hear their name and go free unlock the mystery of who they are that they could leave it with the consciousness of god our consciousness of who they are where they come from and where they're going granted lord in jesus we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise the name of the lord hallelujah this morning our title the redemption of the purchase possession amen that's my title this morning the redemption of the purchase possession another inspiration the coming of the lord have a context scripture from ii peter 3 and i want to read it from verse 3 second peter 3 verse 3. this is read knowing this first that there shall come in the last days coughers walking after their own lust this is part of the package of the last days scoffers and saying this is important now saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning i see no change where is the promise of his coming well william branham was the promise of his coming behold i sent you elijah before the terribly of the lord william branham malachi 4 scripture that was the promise i give you a message down for ron my coming amen hallelujah and elias has already come but they don't know the lord already saying with a shout which is the message hallelujah the lord himself already descended started descending ready with a shout then a voice and a trump but he is coming he is on his way we are making ready for the coming of the lord we are not making ready for a better church come on now we are not ready get ready for a better building no we are making ready for the coming of the lord that's the objective of coming to the church hallelujah together people prepared for his coming are you with me for they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth are known by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and peridition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord of the thousand years and a thousand years as one day the lord here we go is not slack concerning his promise as some men count sadness but is long-suffering to us what not willing that any should perish but it all should come to repentance so right now we're under the long suffering of god that the voice of god to god with one more ride one more voice of mercy once more blood speaking from off the altar hallelujah the voice of god to go out to your loved ones to your family it's the mercies of god so don't talk about all dreaded is how dark it is how sinful it is thank god for his mercy i'm mr darkness i'm missing being dread i miss cross darkness covering the people there's a light that's still shining there's a blood walk that we have to walk oh could we give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also the works that are therein shall be burnt up seeing them that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for adhesion unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with food and heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens come on now let me hear the amen shall we now a new heaven and you hear where it dwell at righteousness wherefore beloved seeing you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless an account that long suffering of our lord is salvation he must all be loved by the paul also according to the wisdom given unto him had written unto you and also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which some things had to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction therefore beloved seen you know these things before beware lest he also being led away with the error of the wicked fall away from your own steadfastness but growing grace the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory and honor no forever and ever amen oh blessed could we give the lord and praise these people ah hallelujah oh glory to god so when adam fell he didn't lost just his eternal life he lost his inheritance in that eternal life god was god over the universe adam was a god of the earth isn't that right and we are promised a double portion isn't that right not only the baptism but there's a down payment but a baptism to change our mortal bodies isn't that right because god is not only redeeming your soul and your spirit he has to also redeem your body also romans 8 said but not we not only day but we ourselves have the first fruit of the spirit we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of the body hallelujah so there's a spiritual adoption and there's a physical adoption we have to come to the physical adoption but before the physical adoption there will be a spiritual adoption where god could take his sons and said listen hear him my life is in him my voice is in him my virtues is in him my blood flows to him hear he him oh glory to god you understand what god will do his hour god gonna find some born sons some phil sons some tested cells some tried sons he sent them to the grinder he send them through hell and they come out he send them to half prison they come true hallelujah praise god all kind of child intestines but they're going to come on victorious because god promised that kind of sun in the last days not no church warm plants no no no no no rugged sons god sees sons sons that won't give up sons that wouldn't let go sons that are steadfast overcoming sons victorious sons sealed sons redeemed sons adopted sons in the last days oh hallelujah are you looking for it are you an expectation for it not dying sons fallen sons failing sons but sons that belong to joyous army hallelujah mighty men of god oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah glory to god may be seated so let's get down now let's get on into the harness israel in the church but abandon says watch if we can't have faith for divine healing how are we going to have rapture and faith that alone should shake up this entire message world if we can't have a healing campaign if you can't have faith for divine healing wait homer rapture have no rapture coming when there's no divine healing it has to have divine healing you're going to find out what that is all about it's not by chance it's not like praying for the sick and we are pentecostals and no no no not it's a program of god because the rapture is actually a glorified healing mortal potential immortality corruption putting on incorruption [Applause] so healing is the illness of the rapture don't payment that if god could take our whole liver and make a new liver you don't hear what i'm saying it's got to take our whole heart and give you and quality cancer and yourself and if god can take your female problem and dissolve [Applause] my god if god could take your blind eye and pop that open and give you a new prayer eyes new kidneys god could give you a new job born god could whatever he is god i am that i am whatever you have need of that is what i am that's what we are talking about [Applause] you may be seated i want to write off not from from now on i have no death church i'm going to know rapture you have no we believe in message we're going to rapture i don't have that you have rapture and faith it's not going to take you into the rapture not just faith you're not hearing what i'm saying you have a term for the faith to take you there you have a currency to take care there never certain money to take care there it's called rapture and faith that's what you come to church to get you're not hearing what i'm saying oh glory to god hallelujah you're not hearing what i'm saying this morning that is what you got to get [Applause] listen to this brother branham i truly believe before the church can have the rapture this is before it's got to have a rapture in faith we can't eat my faith for divine healing let alone wrapped in faith you've got to have faith that will change and quicken this body and be taken away and i believe there's a church on this road tonight a power of the living god that men will speak the word here and there it will flash like lightning a church that is coming out not a psychologist not on put on make believe but a real true genuine anointed holy ghost call out church [Applause] how many believe that how many leaves that's what's coming no psychology and let me say there's no apology oh hallelujah no psychology and no apology well this horrendous do it here this is what we see in it it have no excuses it must be this is that that the prophet william branham speak up go give the lord a shout in the house that's what we're here to do to make a church that would make a revival i'm not hearing what you're saying let me hear you say amen let everybody in the house say amen let everybody connected into that same mentor to make a church that would make a revival not watch and steer you understand what i'm saying um when the devil come around he said not here not this sunday he said not this time they onto something let's go by some other church when the demons go in as demons you know that set of devils they were moving in bunches they tried to move in and take over but not inside of here they could watch but they can't touch you're talking about the redeemed they're talking about the predestinated they're talking about the phone you're talking about the elected you're not talking about no ordinary folks oh come on no hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god [Applause] here's the problem you're in your flesh you know your own thoughts and feelings nothing but tuesday night but isaac was bringing it out but a woman uh i do well and jesus needs to get to her she didn't know who she was she didn't know her name in the book she didn't know she is elected predestinated for known of god she knows nothing about that all she knows she's chiving to help see about the children from this man to that man to that man to that man she is messed up but her name is on the book she is messed up but she's elected she is messed up but she is get that you not hear what i'm preaching you you should be maybe some of you not messed up enough maybe some of you don't have never messed up i don't care about being messed up what i care about is my name is on the book because when the lamb took the book all i wanna hear is what's in that book if my name is on that book i could shout this morning i could scream this morning i could sing a new song [Applause] wow [Applause] before not computer technology when a company have a lot of goods they have goods that are going they've got goods they don't know how much remain and whatnot and the count never did a shot on the company to come how much boxes there how much this deal write it down and whatnot so we know we have six boxes here six bucks any inventor technology and computer whatnot it's all in the system so it's the cash out they know you have two more three more one more whiteboard good well go that technology before my technology [Applause] god book is his database [Applause] of the elected seat as your name get called again check out come on are you here you not hear what i'm saying then god know ah then god know what we mean [Applause] no man can take your place no man can take your spot no man can take your position you are checked out who he found you he called who he called he justified and who he justified he had already glorified [Applause] [Music] [Applause] tell me what sin you can't bring up sin when the predestinated come from the lamb's book the blood section of the book you can't bring that up you are justified as if you never did it never did it never did it never did it you are justified so you never did [Applause] god talked to moses he said i believe that the age has come now the miraculous the phenomena the baptism of the spirit notice he didn't say mysteries more word more knowledge more information more deeper mysteries hidden mysteries mystery mysteries the mysterious hidden mysteries the mysterious mysterious mysteries they go like that mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious hidden flip it all the way around do i know because some of them guess so i don't know they just they're making their own mysteries off they making go like a puzzle that like catholic church long time they take the whole whole thing in latin everybody clueless sick followers they speak in tongues for the whole service they talk in latin people don't know latin only priest do not listen to me and think drinking his own wine and so let's give you a little thing and then dice it a new home you're good for the day but that's what the preacher is doing right now they're talking latin a latin mystery and latin language unknown language it's so mysterious the people don't live nothing they say boy there's a man that is my man like my pastor as if god said truly passively rapture but ram said this message and teaching calling such a perfect man is the man that gonna be redeemed at the end of the seven season this is a message that ties the man that's going to be redeemed those virtues must be in the man the man can't comment in here virtues anybody can say that they have all said let me test at this one we have seven virtues okay let's test it you're frightened you can have all these virtues and frighten afraid all i want to see is the test of forgiveness is all i want to see you forgive me that's all i want to know because if you forgive me you would love me i show to your lovable oh come on give them some praises people feel like dancing feel like shouting feel like praising god you can't tell me your virtues you can't forgive you're not case that makes no sense because that is what this age is about brotherly kindness because faith is based on forgiveness what a mighty god we serve he make sure you can't have faith until you could forgive so people could do whatever they want to do don't let it stick on you to hold an earth or a grudge give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] the test is not for them that's when you're making excuses heeded me and ceded me and some excuse that's you making excuses the test is on you see if you would let it go to see if you will forgive because when you break that song barrier of unforgiveness when you break that salary and you can't forgive you know a different room altogether in a realm of communication with god then your communication restored back to god isn't that right no you could speak to the mountain then you could speak to the rock because you have a basis of faith to approach god a faith without fear faith or condemnation afraid of ruling anybody ought o hallelujah so i believe the phenomena the baptism of the spirit power signs and wonders this great pouring of god's spirit in the last days that's the thing that will bring faith into the people that will take a rapturing fate that will take the church into glory i believe it amen what is going to bring it great outpouring of the spirit not great explanation of mighty gifted preachers or teachers when they hear somebody preaching our teacher will come and said you're no christian that's convicted sinner but teaching this position he plays demand so the position he plays the people last 50 years if the teachers are right in that context then the people have been kneeled into position that's why they can't move that's why they call praise that's why they can't get a breakthrough because they get nailed by teachers near them down they know everything but they can always worship god god is the object of worship what god you're talking about how you could be serving god in account worship [Music] we don't emphasize worship enough i am not talking worship because i have nothing to preach i'm talking worship because you need to do that i'm not here to pray worship worship because i have nothing to preach you need to do that [Applause] and i'm gonna tell you when you need to do that you need to do that when you're not feeling good you need to do that when things are working out nice you need to do that when you're feeling real messed up if we don't do that when you're feeling out the tune and the problems in your house [Applause] god do we need lotto it's not because of god the feeling charged by money they're smiling from air to air but if you're getting an accident or something house building down or something happen dread and you come in here smiling and worshiping and blessing god you'll have people just shaking their heads you know who will be shaking their head the devil number one he'll be people say i just don't get it i frustrate them i make the man bounce the car i and they still come back let me just leave that greedy man alone [Applause] let me just leave that son and daughter we need to give the devil some headaches it against him when he expected

god bless given your encouragement because you can't you you ain't feeling would it encourage your body all that is foolishness that's you feeling that way that's your feeling but when you take that off you are son you god thought of you as by the word and preach he taught us you as a son god can't change his mind you know that monkey you're not an animal you're not a sibling you're a son you may be backsitting but you're still a son you can still bring wood on behalf of the father [Applause] you could still know the father will it have sons who say they will do it and they're not doing it and that's what you said they will not do it and they're doing it you could still know the father as well you could be a disobedient son it's not that you don't know what the father want it's just you not obeying what the father wants but you are still a son you can still approach your father you can say i will arise i will go to my father you can still do that nobody can stop you from doing that nobody can tell you i can't approach your father that is your father hallelujah satan can't approach his father god is not his father he was created in the beginning but you came before the beginning you are the part of the attribute taught gene still of god [Applause] is there shouts in the house it's their sons that see in their name because you can't see your name and seeing him again you know the cover memory problem you know i see my name last week and you know what my name is again that's a that's a real problem you see your name then oh you're gonna forget your name when you see your

kind of wearing long dress not ashamed to hide in the face or in this little eye seeing they have no problems with that but my daughters have problems we could have a problem with who they are and the consciousness of who they are if they only know who they are they'll be privileged and proud and pleased and blessed to dress right upright talk right live right through right [Applause] so you understand your porn of the spirit man they stuck on revelation because they could break it out cut their head full they have a fro they head high they're loaded with information and they'll see the people out to drop it on them i wanted people dropping them to drop on them that they can't move three hours paralyzed by words from master teachers man that could craft and make them see what even out there them fellas like magicians you know there's tricks and friction i call that verbal gymnastics but jesus said the promise of the father the promise of the father tarry in jerusalem until they received the promise of the holy ghost he was pointing them to something he wasn't just informing them informing them you open their own to the scriptures but if they understand it open is that somebody close it back up or it's still open right is either the sign open is that you open the word or you open your word how much time do you open it would open your word come back let me open the world again come back over with it again i come back years ago preacher preaching layner foundation leader foundation after after three months helena foundation again i said when is the building gonna go up every three months elena foundation laying a foundation leading a foundation i'm looking down on the ground and see the foundation when is the building going to go up i'm seeing foundation foundation there's only excuses tell the people we are now in the ministry of the word isn't that right the time of these things being made known that is not a leaner foundation it's bringing the word to the people know that we are here where we are in 2016. you can't tell me we relaying a foundation now but apparently said i'm only building a foundation for a short quick message but not a long

road now prophecy soon the coming of the lord jesus and we've got to have a rapture in faith in the church that can be changed in a moment and trick of an eye or we will not go no rapture in faith no rapture there's no if it's on a bot you can sleep on the books and listen to the tips till you know them by heart that is not rapture in faith watch he said but don't worry it will be there it will be there and when the power of this church rises not mysteries not revelation when the power somebody showed power somebody shall power when the power of this church rises it will bring the brethren a lot of prejudice coming until the power comes in [Applause] did you hear that a lot of pressure not coming until the power comes in but when the power comes in they're going to fly in the church oh glory to god all those hypocrites all those liars all those highland shepherds they're going to be busted when god david that holy spirit ministry rise on the scene oh glory to god let my people go pharaoh they are coming out they are coming out they're going to come out the seventh time that's going to bring them out oh give the lord i shout it's the voice of god it's the voice of god in the last days i will give the lord some praises [Applause] right now the argument is on doctrine and teachings because that is what man could argue about but you can't dispute a manifestation everybody know the man was lame in front of it everybody know that his years he's begging his years he's getting coins is he ass people looking down at him it's yes he's that condition for when peter woke up to that man mighty apostle paul peter mighty apostle without other credit card mighty apostle without dollars in his pocket but he's a silver and gold have i none such as i have i give it unto you rise up and walk rise up and walk rise up and walk don't sit where you are rise up and walk [Applause] that's a sign of the resurrection a sign of rapturing fate a sign a man crippled for so long and they could say rise up and walk rise up and walk and the man does having to leap and jump leap and jump not walk like you want to go and sit down they get to get more coins nowhere to go to work because you could walk now you can't no excuse now you can't go on bed now because you could walk now jesus made your hole now watch something now when people see that it's not a wonder glorified paterno remember what we said this morning as soon as a man gets something a little thing you want to be a little god peace at the experience you think by my holiness this might make all i am peter the one who denies jesus is the same one who cares that's me but you see this man here it's by faith in jesus name is this manhole here it's me same peter but this jesus you don't know what i'm saying it's the holy ghost it's the spirit that that man is made all right don't put it with me peter i am full of force and mistake but this jesus you hear what i'm saying [Applause] a that was a shaker for the fire season because the churches were intact unt until the avengers died there was jews maybe season when jesus died they were they fought a sigh relief boy judas was part of the plan to give him so much sylvester between christ and everything everything set along now afterwards they said jesus recently dead but they see no evidence because you just have private ministry going on didn't know what going on that's just among the disciples and elected they don't know anything else but when you see jesus begin to come from the inside to come on the outside to give a demonstration of the hidden power that the pillar fire brought in the upper room when that jesus that they can't see that touch when that fire that's on the inside begin to express itself on the outside in signs in wonders in miracles in the power of god when that begins to happen then the devil have to take note pharisees have to take note status is under that note the message won't have to take note the hypocrites have to take note the backfires have to take note that they have been with jesus right now when the holy ghost fell up a room with a lot of noise it wasn't just what is that people here in the world are going underneath them and the four beasts raise their hands and 24 elders give them a signal they stop in traffic they say amen they say hello rejoicing son that noise when the devil heard about that he said that he's noise right now he definitely hearing noise she's just quiet everybody's settling the in the message yes i don't know what message they're in they're in the message i told the message of the open book once you start to see that book you have to you are one in a million you know it comes like you complaining about your roof have a leak are you upset because i have a hole in the galvanized there's some people with no garbage they don't even have a roof so you better shout it's only a hole you have [Applause] some people complain about their guarantee but some people don't have a p so thank god for your p you see you have to change the pictures and let that devil get messed up he can't catch you out the sink can't catch your outer timing with your words i can do all things through christ i'm fine i'm well let the weak say i am strong he barren let the desert blossom come on now hallelujah you're tired and weary you stand up and give god praise you could say don't die at a time i'll tell you something about that anymore and say todd never say yes you are tired we know that and two more demons come and say we know that all of us support you in your tiredness but when you shake that off and say so help me god you're entirely tired glory to god you can still worship god yes you can still break out yes you can rejoice you could shout you can stand up hallelujah stand up with nobody standing up glory to god you're not standing because somebody ain't standing up you stand up because you want to stand up you want to give god praise you want the glorifiers there you want to join the heavenly chorus you want to join the four beasts you want to join the 24 hours you want to join the rejoice in time for the lamb taking the book that's a jubilee that jubilee is a release actually means freedom a jubilee means going back to your possession [Applause] first seal there is coming forth seven mysterious standards they're not even written at all that's right and i believe that true those seven thunders will be revealed in last days in order to get the bride together for rapture and fate so there's a gathering by those seven tenors to get the bride together for rapture and fate because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it we have got to step further say a step further hallelujah you gotta stretch [Applause] so you got to go past your comfort zone and all of you have a comfort zone where you feel safe when you feel it can't break out and go beyond but we are being challenged this morning to go where no other group where no other man with no other church where no other people when order individuals gone before you're not hearing what i'm saying oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah your wife did not expect in this your husband not expecting this your children not expecting this but it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming rapture and faith is coming the power of god is coming the holy ghost is coming science oneness america is coming [Applause] because what we have we won't be able to do it there's something got a step further we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we have got to get enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept off the earth and we will find after a while where it is written what is he saying there must come a time where divine healing become preeminent in the church listen to this from once more lord we got members but they're weak they love the things of the world better than they do the things of god look upon the churches and find out don't try to deny it i'm reading don't think it's i saying these things yeah i'ma need you to finally cause the speech for me many people say i'm not a preacher that is true so i let it quote spiritually don't try to deny it your actions speak louder than your words you are big muscles but you won't meet the child you are the rapture and feature take the church out before judgments try to hear it numbers doesn't mean nothing i might have a thousand two thousand people in church what are these they raptured like two thousand then compete with pope francis pope are millions so it's not numbers it comes down to the faith isn't that right brethren the entire message i'll reveal it sixth fourth percent gabriel this is daniel there you are it shakes me to think the mystery the things that the church world bats their eyes and say it's nonsense the mystery of who jesus is not the third person not the second person not the third person but the person of god after all the other mysteries of god revealed because it's wrote in the book revealed to the end time generation they can no more seat in seminaries and schools and nominations no wonder they think you're crazy no wonder you think you're foolish no one that they can't understand why you don't clock up with them because here we go yeah because there's a power and a vision behind it a word of god that's been here we go revealed to get the church in order for the rapture under going home so all this revelation was supposed to get the church in order for the rapture for the coming of the lord isn't that right so this new heaven and you earth the bible talk about john say i saw a new heaven and a new earth peter talk about the fire reserved isn't that right to clean up the heavens and the earth what does it do there's some this is from our future home of the heavenly barrier these tissues and sickness and death and politics and sinful men watch and sinful women and evil spirits will be gone away and annihilated it has to be done away because we are going to live here we prove it by the bible what when the lamb took the book what did john said we shall reign on the earth so we are not angels so all of you are angels when you're dusting us when you go home you have to understand because you don't have that you fooling yourself thinking you are some angels we going to reign not in heaven on the earth so heaven is just part of where we going to come back so if we sleep we go so and then we come back so and we who here we have to have a different arrangement all together so god have arrangement for those who've gone on before and those who here we who are alive and remain that's what the bible designate us we who are alive and remain shall be caught up [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah there are those who have died and going on but we don't want we were alive and remain shall be caught up oh glory to god so watch praise god watch all our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when god created it so when god said let there be earth he was saying let there be your bodies [Applause] i'm not hearing you give me a shout on that one when god made the earth he made your bodies that's why he said dust fall man out of the dust of the earth oh give the lord a shout do you see no feeling preaching no no no feeling like creature so when god spoke the earth in existence he was speaking your body [Applause] you are a physical manifestation of the attribute that you are in god right now [Applause] that's why you have to get a new body because we don't have a new earth do you remember what i'm saying there's got to be a new earth for this new body i am not hearing you there's a mystery being unfolded this is hidden mystery [Applause] this is all earth this is putin and obama and we have right now rowley and whoever it is all these governments now that is their business that their world all the tricks for the money and different exchanges and money exchanges and all kinds of things like that that is the world now all the demons in the atmosphere they need atmosphere listen up what kind of satellite and what kind of spy plane all right getting up in the air all that all that burning all that coming down that god universe they're playing up it up there then god had been floating up there when you're looking up in here you have knew it and you've seen some kind of saturn like what are they doing there y'all don't need a cell phone jesus bypasses theophany no we bypass autophagy jesus did not bypass us he often he came from thought toward the flesh so he knowed all things so watching him to us when we get back to our teopony we're going to know all things there's a word for that at that that you shall know i'm in the fire you in miami we only come along on this earth to be tested we only come on the earth to be tried that's why your band passed the word buddy [Applause] and you're complaining about your trials about your frustration but that's what you're sent here for [Applause] when you were sent frustration was written for you my god depression was sitting down looking for you i am the pressure let me introduce myself [Applause] sickness was waiting for you all age great here everything was lined up you see well you're just waiting you know you're young now two years old you can't get great two years old you don't have that but put put 40 years on that now when you see the degree here coming great i say look look hold that you had no gray hair over sun green here come and just drop something over here let me recognize it again you could diet but you're still getting wool it doesn't hide it but you still you stay there you understand what i'm saying so i am saying we are here are you ready to overcome [Applause] i want you to see that i want you to see that say it out to me i am here to overcome or give the lord a shout [Applause] you may be seated you can't change women you can't change money you cutting popularity you can't change your temptation you can't change nothing out there but you could change you and how you face woman money and popularity you could face you take change you how you view whatever is confronting you and you have to understand you were raised up to destroy the works of the enemy yes yes yes yes you will wake up and don't expect no encouragement from the devil because he don't know who jesus was he never knew who jesus was that's why i said if dog be the son of god turn these stones and if he didn't know who christ was how on earth could he know who we are you are fighting for your place in the sun yes you are fighting for your position in christ hallelujah praise so the devil will not believe in nothing because you smoke your drink and lie you live all kind of life and so on he knows it he saw it he had his agents he had his recorder you have his videotape everything else the only thing you don't have is blood that jesus is coming hallelujah someone said that's how he look you did this blood blood blood complaining blood blood lord was the blood i died for them that's why i paid a cough that's why i went to calvary sit and complain and completely keep on complaining but i know it was the blood oh take the lord and shout in the house [Applause] oh [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah how many going free this morning glory to god you're gonna be redeemed by the blood of the lamb thou hast redeemed us by dyed blood [Applause] glory glory glory hallelujah glory to god hallelujah you said satan is the ruler of the earth and its atmosphere you said atmosphere both heaven and earth you may be seated is now contaminated with devils that can accuse us before god jesus is dear to intercede for us while the accuser keep pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this but the blood still covers he came to redeem that elected that he foresaw that is why he said it's so filthy today now watch here's a human heart and he draw a heart inside of it there's a snake watch that is what make the sin the life this one over here has a dove in it so two hearts which is the holy spirit that has a life he has malice the one with snake have malice hatred envy that's what causing it is that fellow inside the deer that snake in the heart is inside of there now when you are asking to forgive you of your sins that has been forgiven and taken away but i think that court is still there so god forgive me for lying stealing robbing whatever god forgive you but the snake is still there that's justification god forgive you but the thing that causes you to do it is still there then comes sanctification watch sets our mind in order of holiness to think right sanification is a compound greek word which means a cleanse and set aside for service the next comes the baptism of fire and the holy ghost that god might dwell in us and the fire of god here we go cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the holy ghost inside then we bring forth the same life that they did back there notice he didn't say teachings he didn't say mysteries he didn't say the letter of the word he said the fire of god cleanses our hearts from sin isn't that right a man can repent of his sins or maybe he's a moral man every more looking woman he finds it's still there maybe he's a drunkard every time he smells that drink it is still there when he gets sanctified it cleanses that desire out of him it takes the want of it away he can still be tempted but it takes the want of it away but when he is baptized with the holy ghost on fire and the other words cleansed burnt out cleaned up and then put into the service of god because our standard direction means set aside for service but the holy ghost puts us in in service excuse me so look i was striking he takes the place where he had to dwell in through the same process he is called the church through justification call the church on vacation then fill it with the holy ghost and fire he took it to a process that he himself the holy spirit himself the son of god can dwell in it amen now watch a mystery what people did not know noah's day with water got judged by water and so on flood and so on it wasn't just that he was redeeming the earth by baptizing it in water so the mystery behind noah 128th year old prophecy and the ark and the flood was god saying i am taken back what is mines i am going to redeem my purchase possession isn't that right he was going to die to redeem everything everything that was lost so he baptized the earth and water when jesus died his blood sanctified the earth there's only one thing left fire fire fire and the same way he redeems the earth he redeems the individual you are justified that's why you get baptized in water you are sanctified by the blood and then god has to baptize it with fire somebody shot fire [Applause] oh glory oh glory oh hallelujah you might be seated but the clients if it is how they preaching today with all these teachings and word then it means that god you don't need you just need water you just need blood and you just need a word that's how god reading the earth but i know what john saw john saw a new heaven on your earth john said there was no more sea but iran said the fire could be so powerful you're going to break up the h2 from the oh there'll be no more water god going to renovate it just god going to renovate your life because god's going to give you a new body it will be a glorified body this body is not the body you're going to see me in my god is a dying man this is a dying body but we're going to have a glorified body we shall not hinder those that are asleep they're coming back for their body and our body will be changed in the moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet of the lord and son that in christ shall life incorruptable we shall be changed oh hallelujah oh glory to god ah even the cinnamon after rice the uncutly man have to rise everybody have to rise because there's a judgment time coming oh that is not the judgment there's one beyond that and i've come they second afghanistan but that had no power over the blood washed once oh i feel like dancing that had no power over the blood watchman my god i feel really pentecostal right now death have no power why were the blood washed once thomas redeemed us by thy blood and us lead us unto god kings and priests oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god who may be seated let brother man on this crime this fire come into the earth what it is to burn he said the battling of fire wholly far from god will cleanse the earth and the heavens around it it is purchased so the redeemed can live on it live in peace notice the baptismal fire is a cleanser from sin from sickness from diseased germs from sinners from the devil and all his group he's to be cast in the lake of fire holy far from god coming from god watch god's notice to make it ready for god to dwell in god in the new world has to come to dwell on the earth god god he dwells in the human heart but he and the bride becomes one and they go to their new home in their new world here we go the same plan of redemption is used to redeem both the world and the persons that live in it so the world has to be redeemed by water in noah's day by blood in jesus day by fire that is yet to come and you have to redeem by the water by the blood and by the baptism of fire could we say amen [Applause] oh holland i know this is not preached much because this is old school hallelujah people want new school and then the holy fire and holy ghost from god comes down by comparing it back now to your human heart and burns out the desire of sin the nature of sin how can he be a sinner and a redeemed man at the same time how can i be in a pawnshop and alter the porn trap at the same time he redeemed us by his blood by his spirit he cleanse us then comes out to dwell in us the church not in our mission the church now watch see satan satan still has a claim because it's a marked but jesus buys it by his shed blood so watch it's purchased but not yet taken [Music] i'm not hearing you you have been purchased [Applause] but not yet taken so what he's coming back for he's coming for his purchase possession and he gives the holy ghost as a dung payment [Applause] of your inheritance oh glory my god i feel the fire in the house in the building do you understand what the common lord is about he's coming back for his purchase [Music] the baptism watch the baptism of fire cleanses it from all germs all these eases all sicknesses watch he redeems it the same way he does his people he makes it all the same his plan of redemption he's the unchangeable god always the same in his plans now in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and dull among us three stages it was attribute first was in god and he thought of himself as a human being and that transmitted him down to be jesus no you will ever be there if you'll ever be dear you was with him then for there is only one form of eternal life and that's god and you had to be part of god at the beginning not what you choose down here he chose you that is enough to make everybody in the church shout this morning [Applause] it's not even your choice and i cash out and i can rejoice and i cannot be happy you got to be crazy i am going to shout i am going to rejoice i am going to be happy because he chose me [Applause] why me what you see in me i know god forget that he chose you just started thank him and we joined i failed here and i failed there and i felt that balaam said when you're going to the other side you're surprised in the world on the other side among the weak feeling what kind of people will be on the side the price on who will be up there all them praying strong and praying forget that laws on your name in the book rejoice shout god gonna bring you through you're gonna overcome you're going to get the devil the final slap oh let me slapping you but you going to get the final slap come on give the lord a shout yes yes yes yes yes you going to get the devil that final kick [Applause] now look at the priests here this is important the priest you want with the nice clothes fancy beard nice thing on top of his head looking very spiritual and so on smooth face looking very peaceful and so on calm and soothing words that is the priest the embarrassment going right down to his head i mean they have a designer for those garments in those days it wasn't normal garments you know that's the priest coming there's no ifs there's no buts but his real wear and walk his special sanders with the gold trimmings and his shoes tip that's the priest he's coming highly respected let's hear about him we find his bottom part here his back life behind him his predestination is sinful [Music] now look at this blackboard here he represent purity he was a priest he was an honorable man he said he had to be a good man or he couldn't be a priest you don't put bad men as priests mafia as priests gangster as priests that'll be at least a good man to be in the priesthood but but you see he gutted by intellectual learning that's the priest so he has no divine revelation he went and studied in the priesthood he knew how to be a priest how to sprinkle the thing lie the candle to the altar how to bless people and so on and as a ritual he's a priest look at the woman woman at the well her first life she was a prostitute she was all mad up but we're done in her watch watch i know when the messiah cometh notice when jesus came and manifested the word because the word is under torch watch watch what happened the priest with his intellectual learning said it's a devil so the priest called jesus the devil because that's what his denomination called it today is what the group say individuals in the group have no revelation they have a group revelation so however they passed a pedal in the head and mess up the head the whole church messed up like that so they have no individual life they have a collective life as dictated and promulgated by the pastor who is not a good shepherd who is a highland because the good shepherd is feeding sheep the word of god and don't put the pastor spirit on the people the good shepherd just put the holy ghost on the people the word that's what the good shepherd does a highland shepherd has to mess them up to attach the people to themselves [Applause] but we get our shout in the house are we preaching to the elected today all right you may be seated what happened this priest but only electoral learning said it's the devil because that's what the university called it what did he do he had no representation so it blocked him out right this little woman had nothing to present i like this she was filthy and dirty as she could be but she got representation [Applause] i could have been amanda i found your whole immaculate one i hope you're not a priest here [Music] this little woman had none the present she's filthy dirty as she could be but notice way down in her she got representation she was looking for this to be made flesh he said go get your husband and come here she's have none she said he said the truth because you have five and the one your label is not yours you had five that makes six your heart she said sir you're not basically i perceive you a prophet amen no more doubt you didn't have to explain it she saw it she believed it and where she went why what did it do to her it redeemed her so she went from black to white the priest went from white to black he was out because he had no representation but this woman who was a prostitute because she had representation she had predestination the hell that's what the redemption is about the redemption is about the predestination [Applause] it's not everybody he said all that the father had given me past tense will come oh give the lord a shout all that the father had given me will come nobody could stop you no child could stop you no sin could stop you no sickness could stop you nothing could stop you you could be boxing 30 years that can't even stop you [Applause] look look at that man going to the pool today yes not 38 months not 28 weeks a yearly pilgrimage to every time i come somebody coming in front of me no no either is normal people after the first two years at that time i ain't going back there because you know what happened is everybody better than me to go inside for 30 years same testimony every time i come hello man to help me you think jesus god almighty wasn't seeing that man granted yes does he test of of of perseverance of tenacity of fortitude of guts hallelujah persevering what's the goal you know they better come every year than to say doctor only charging me and charging me and cutting nothing take a pill take a pill take a pill pick up he'll come back next next take six months this is taking dr pills every year he's going jesus walk up to the man and say well now we made home [Music] demanding advertising youtube or facebook or any people someone read you on the television or i am sick please send somebody to me this is greece this is god this is election come walking down to him will you be made whole this morning today oh hallelujah didn't ask for it did me claim that this is this is redemption at work this is to redeem this man from his sickness from his condition from his ill health to bring him back to health from his blindness from his sickness from defeat from being in prison this is bringing you out didn't ask for it let it come and walk into you will you be made whole it's a question is something that we ask and only you can answer it oh hallelujah you

get a born again christian for god the foundation that will foreshore him and jesus god sent jesus redeem him and the blood speaks for him how can he sin he can't even be seen the only thing he hears your voice he sees your representation so when that blood come and covers you with that fire baptism go take a hold upon your life god didn't see you god only hear in your voice he's seen your representation you are beholden he is beholding you before the father and jesus said father glorify me with the glory i had birthday before the word was they were with me oh glory they don't have a clue what he's talking about but he know what he's talking about because he came from that path that god part oh hallelujah that eternal pact and at the same path we come from but because we bypass that world image because we bypass that theophany we can't remember it but god is bringing back to all remembrance what our inheritance is all about isn't that right hallelujah so watch praise be to jesus hallelujah hey many men he said he talked about the heaven the issue going to explode he said you know when a man received the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around here they think it's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that wait till they would get a baptism so when a man so is he saying you know wait till the baptism all the volcanics and the explosions and everything else and when a man get the bacteria you talk about the scream and the shock that way they were staggering like drunk men in the upper room they were screaming they were shouting they were staggered mary was then with them mary wasn't saying no i am sister mary and i am mary and mary mary have fire to get hallelujah sister married a quiet marina when that fire come and put your bones on fire heart on fire your mind and fire praise god sister mary cooking the best bread for brother husband oh glory to god it's the merry feeling to preach after that mr mary light transform the bread is anointed the baker's anointed cake is anointed everything she puts your hands to the anointed because fire is upon sister mary oh glory to god give the lord let the marriage give the lord some praise people [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god hallelujah now watch i try to speak to the best of my knowledge all that i know how to glorify jesus christ who has redeemed us all redeemed from everything that's the fall consists of he came as a kinsman to redeem the human race back to god and we have the illness of our salvation this that we have now this glorious holy spirit is only the earnest of our being above sin in the rapture amen the earnest is the down payment it means more is yet to come amen it comes like if you have two hundred thousands to get and you get twenty thousand dollars down hold that you have a hundred and eighty thousand dollars coming now if they get a little thing and run with it and do like it that is it you see that's a different thing all together but this is saying more is yet to come okay here have a bomb yeah drop on your head are you ready if there is no divine healing there is no resurrection of the body [Applause] divine healing is the earnest of our redeemed body did you hear that amen healing is evidence our bodies physically it's going to be redeemed you heard a testimony about the woman born without eyes and she came up to the platform to brother brown then he spoke the word for and then a light came and began to circle around the sockets out in the middle of that he stopped i said wait a minute i forget to actually what color eyes you want she said here blue is a nice color and it's finished [Applause] do you understand what that is about the god of make eyes nose [Applause] do you understand your body already made dust of the earth just thou art dust though shall return but god gonna glorify that body because you're gonna glorify the earth as it was you have a new earth it take a new body to come on the new earth [Applause] you understand how important if this tablet could be resolved we have one awaiting [Applause] do you understand what paul saying about putting off this tabernacle this house have a new house check out this place house have another host with him have another building waiting is no big thing get tacked no power over the blood wash one no one in the pocket said death where is your sting great place to victory you have no victory over me because i know where i'm going no devil to hold this body down oh hallelujah is gonna hold this body down you are belonging to the redeemed [Applause] you belong to reading listen to this divine healing is the earnest of our redeemed body did you ever think of that if there is no divine healing when you go to the grave that's all of it you'll be there forever but i think that the power of god that will take a cancer-ridden woman that a doctor has just given a few days she's one of thousands on the records not just the man the person's testimony but a doctor's testimony one of thousands and her eaten up with few hours to live by cancer and by the illness of her redeemed body will put her in the condition it is now what will it be when she draws the full value off of the resurrection of jesus christ i love that otherwise the world was eaten dying and she was redeemed as it was by her and he was healed he said what it was going to be when she draw the full value off of the resurrection oh we're gonna enjoy the full valley we have to draw the full value oh hallelujah he redeemed your soul he redeemed your spirit he's gonna redeem your body you'll be drawing the full value of the resurrection of jesus christ oh give the lord a shout [Applause] so now you can understand why jesus could say as a mortal man destroyed this body and in three days i myself i will raise it up myself destroy it all you have to work with is three days within three days i raised up myself and when he died he rose within three days oh hallelujah try to don't touch me yet i have nothing to send it to my father oh hallelujah jesus body pass into walls time space hallelujah no more time no more space no more distance no more material nothing could stop you glory to god hallelujah he passed to what peace be unto you it is i myself handle me oh give the lord a shout in the house this is real this morning this is real this morning this is real this morning but that same resurrection power that came upon jesus going to come upon you oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah gloria the earnest i'm gonna be seated is a down payment or anything that holds it secure she's just got the illness of it by being healed of a hideous cancer that would take a life now she's sitting there well and normal oh hallelujah prays the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord he talked about and then jesus laid a complete salvation completely van halen if there is no divine healing there's no resurrection of the dead i like to wade over that we have first fruit of our inheritance the earnest of salvation the little touch that we have watch watch watch everybody's saying here now the little touch that we have when i walk up here to that screen a while scream a while ago and hear the screaming and praising god and the holy spirit fallen and tears rolling down cheeks while we were singing all healed the power of jesus name when i stood this morning i heard that little jewett this morning sing i watch that's the earnest that's the donkeyman that is something at the whole of it there is the proof watch it comes upon us and take the desire of sin out of us we have no more desire to sin the worshiper once purged then something then becomes perfect where we stand with the angelic choirs when then if divine healing is the earnest of all redeemed bodies the earnest of our reading bodies and if god can reach down and take cancer-ridden florence ninth and gale watch and if god can reach down to that poor richard mortal that couldn't even raise her hands to shake hands couldn't speak till i could hear her and put her to 150 pounds in perfect health that is the illness of our resurrected body oh hallelujah so you can understand what will drive rapture in faith you will understand the supernatural and the power of god that is among the people to activate this rapture and faith among god's people oh glory to god from who just mentions the deck like you woman claiming you've got the holy ghost how could the spirit of god and you ever do such a thing wearing shorts and so on it's not a filthy spirit it's holy spirit now listen to this when you become subject to that spirit here we go it shows your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened amen that spirit is nothing but the seed word may manifest or quicken so in other words it come right back to the secret is the word is in the bride and then that word transform into power and that's the kingdom of god because the kingdom of god is the word made spirit and power in your life so you're not coming to church in vain you're coming to church to be seated on with the word with the prophecy of the book to get the word in you this is what the devil could not understand for the last 50 years the bride was nailed on by the word spirit of prophecy testimony of jesus the living word the word coming word by word by word but now the spirit the law of the spirit the law of the spirit is in the word hallelujah going to transform that word in your life into spirit into power this is what the devil was that catering for he thought we were battered and bruised just between a long hard word battle but it's not so there's an appointed time i will return in today according to the time of life and you're going to have that son that's not talk now that's not 25 years saying i'm gonna have isaac no no no this is the time of life now there's a time to produce something oh glory to god when that egg hit that sperm that was a conception isaac was on his way he had nine months to him to comfort but he was on his way oh we have a right to rejoice because i feel that egg hit that swim is it just a matter of time now for that baby to come forth oh glory to god are you with me now hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory glory so when a man is born again from heaven i'm going back up a little bit he's somebody a woman of our baby see how cruel she is she gets really kind what happened there's a body what this body now is not alive yet the only thing is flesh and muscles bumping and when the baby comes to the womb god breathes the breath of life into it and then it screams out so the natural body is formed and outside the womb there's a spirit life to hit that body and then you have a baby alive well the reverse is also true we are spirit babes in christ and outside of us have that body that if this body fall down we have a body to go into isn't that right say hey he's bringing it now when a man is born again from heaven he become a spirit babe in christ and when this robe of flesh is dropped there's a natural body teopany a body not made with hands need a bone of woman that we go into and then that body returns back and picks up the glory fight body that's the reason jesus went to hell when he died and preached his souls in prison he turned back into teopening and if corinthians 5 1 if this earthly body be dissolved this earthly tabernacle we have another one we have bypassed that to come straight from god the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin aha so you bypass the attribute of god to be what test it and turn to my sin like adam did but when testing of his word is over when we are taken up into this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skipped to come right down to be tempted and tested and if we come through that there have been no temptation we would know all things the reason jesus knew all things he was worried because he before he was flesh and then we become the word and here we are to be formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word to feed on the word and being predestinated since the beginning you see a little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember it you joined church you tried this nothing satisfied but one day you just recognized it then after you recognized the very word of god was eager food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the living word you heard from your theophany if this earthly body be deserved we have one waiting when moses seen him he see them in a theophany when abraham saw him he saw his name he saw he called him elohim isn't that right he was in a theophany form notice therefore the theophany here we go are you ready everybody alive right now therefore if you have died and entered into that theophany what happens is something he's revealing here the theoretically comes to earth to pick up the redeemed body [Music] if you are here in the air you take the body to meet the theophany there you are you are caught up to meet the lord in the air so those that have died they have to come back for the reading body those that are here have to leave with the redeem body pick up the tea offering so we have to connect we will not hit the those that are asleep or give the lord a shout oh glory to god you come from god you're going right back to god isn't that right hallelujah know the world how did he read in the world first he did when it's sin he wash him with water baptism you drop his blood on it and then now he tore the world out of you and renovate the whole thing by the fiery baptism holy ghost which he will renovate the hood so watch it showed blindly the watch the natural british tree water then blood then spirit isn't that right what happened to a plant that rots this talk the tassel this is shocked then the grain comes out watch showing plainly are you ready the predestinated is the only one that is considered in redemption did you get that let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that is considered in redemption people might think they are making like they are but the real redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back to redeem is to bring back to its original bring back the original oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah almost finished here now praise be to god now watch from the breach watch he said he comes forth from eternity yonder and then he's the king of redeemer he holds it all he called the contestant hand satan they are mine now i've raised him up from the grave he take all the liars and perverters of the world all them like that with satan and destroy them a little fire now watch what happened with eight to fourteen we read it and i'll be holding the midst of the throne the four beasts ellis to the lamb seven spirits seven church ages seven messengers that kept the fire burning and they took the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now watch what's he done watch what taking place you talk about the jubilee this is exactly the breaking of them sees look what take place all creation is groaning no one knows what to do john was weeping man felon lost it no one was able to do anything but redeem anymore isn't that right no priest no pope could redeem it no mary but here in the future tonight he's a mediator and then those under the altar prayed so long they prayed for redemption they prayed for resurrection we have got a representative we have got a kinsman he come to make claims isn't that right he wanted to come back and watch they wanted to come back they are going to be back as kings and priests glory he said i feel good to speak in tongues he said i don't have enough language he said i be held and i hear the voice of any angels he says talk about the jubilee when they see the lamb come and take the blood of redemption the souls scream out we will get it all everything the elders fell down they poured all the prayers of the saints they were presented a kinsmen represent kisman for us they fell upon their faces they sang a new song the one wordy and i heard the voice of many angels around about the throne and thousands time thousands and thousands sing with a lord voice worthy as the lamb that was seen to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor what a jubilee going on in heaven as the lamb leaves in the cessary box watch to come and possess his claims oh hallelujah hallelujah what he died for what he purchased for he's coming to get o hallelujah praise god amen and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth underneath the earth such as in the sea all that is there and heard me say blessed honor glory power in the sun upon the throne you talk about the jubilee you talk about the time when the lamb walk fought the book sealed the mysteries is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is it was put down there before the foundation of the world if your name is on that book that was put there before the foundation of the world oh glory to god and when he opened the book and tore up the seals and sent her down to the earth seven angels to reveal it to the people oh my what happened the scream the shouts the hallelujah the anointing the power the glory the manifestation all john who have been standing there crying said everything in heaven heard i holler and say blessing and honor might power unto him never you talk about a happy time john must have looked in past the curtain of time and said there is john he was so happy everything in heaven he must have cried out everything in heaven everything under the earth said blessing and honor might and power dominion onto the lamp forever and ever my god you made enough bread tomorrow to eat but your name is on that book you don't know why you're paying your pills you don't know where getting money to pay your rent you don't have a good debt to sleep on but your name is on that book all john must have said bless and honor might and power dominion unto the lamb forever oh glory to god brother branham said why not to be shepherds no wonder the monster jumped and shouted on that day when jesus died no wonder the mountains jumped and sheltered that day no wonder all nature broke loose the wind struck the trees they shook and shook and jumped for joy they seen the prophet shepherd they seen it all nature was redeemed they scream and jump the world went in an earthquake the rocks fell off hallelujah and everything has taken place like in any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you it is finished your sin is finished the world is finished your redemption is finished [Applause] [Music] final quote i have seen jumping spells joy spells nobody hurt the mountains rung out the sun went down everything took place nobody was hurt i've seen meetings when the power of god was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world the joy of the lord filled the congregation they stood they screamed they cried they shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of god i never seen anything disorderly and that's always right in order because they recognize that their name that's been written in the land book of life the great prophet shepherd had brought them the message and they were delivered the prophet shepherd no matter what the other eclassical system they know what took place may the lord bless you oh give the lord a shout has the lord revealed to your name your name in the lamb spoke oh hallelujah hallelujah may the lord bless you oh give him a shout give him a shout of praise this morning hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] oh how many appreciate a
