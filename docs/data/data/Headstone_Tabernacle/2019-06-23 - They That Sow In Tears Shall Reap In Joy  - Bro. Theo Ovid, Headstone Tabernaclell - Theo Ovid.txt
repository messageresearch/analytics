bless you we want to go straight in the word this morning thank you musicians we want to look at three portion of scriptures this morning or bless you welcome and those connected to us life we welcome also we want to look at proverbs after for from 2223 one look at Sam's 1:26 and also that's the whole chapter and eclair sees chapter 11 one verse verse four proverbs chapter four reading from verse 20 my son attend to my words in kind an ear unto my sayings let him not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst then heart for their life and the doors that find them and health to all their flesh keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life the readin psalms 126 this is a beautiful Sam when the Lord turn again the captivity of Zion we were like them that dream then was our mount filbert laughter and our tongue with singing then said they among the hidden the Lord had done great things for them the Lord had done great things for us whereof we are glad turnigy no captivity O Lord as the streams in the south they that sow in tears shall reap in joy he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him and our last a scripture from acquiesces chapter 11 verse 4 he had observed the wind shall not show and he that regarded the clothes shall not reap may God bless his word you may be seated in it is look at the show that's what you came here to do you commit to worship come here to praise God sounds 126 when the Lord is the amplified when the Lord brought back the captives who returned as I and we were like those who dreamed it seems so unreal coming out of a captivity seems so unreal coming out of your sickness coming out of your condition coming out of your bondage hallelujah God bringing you out it's something else forgot to bring you out bring your with a mighty hand or glory of God that the hidden will say or the Lord is with them the Lord is working with them look at that I don't let us look at that they passed you hell the pasture captivity devil had them both for years but look at them now or glory to God laughter each little dinner or glory of God joy returning praises we turn and look at them now all glory to God and coming out and oppression they come under the frustration or glory to God hallelujah praise God how many believe you're

rejoice and I will show before your coming out oh not next week this morning [Applause] or glory no God see many home chefs at the convention and we're looking forward a lot to do greetings among us my teachings among us or the church or we have a great time ahead of us and I walk on of earthquakes and troubles and darkness and what kind of stuff but it's up a grid and coming Gorgo to make sure this bright get the devil a run for his money devil and getting away at all they ever think you have it easy he doesn't have it easy or found our fathers their ever easy in the gonna even you run them out you make them fall and run them out or glory to God no board running us right back back to the tree of life back into power back into inheritance bacteria tempted rights so I want you to follow it me priest what this world is not your home look get get camped on inside of here whatever god bless you it is really serving better nothing to beat your chest and say God give me this and I have this and I'll forget that so beating your chest or glory to God be grateful to God that God bless you that you could serve him better the clothes you have is a silver better because I've is to serve them better the hopes you have is a silver better [Applause] the family God gave us or served him better God give the Lord I show I want you to feel so good about that that Robert double your blessing whoa if you act right with God to bless it go go double it up alone because you leave my you will act even better but usually when God people get blessed to forget God that's the sad thing usually when people get real bless they push God in the corner they will either one might and the only strength because I have this and you have that and if I get this God who place them there who bless them they're all praise gone well what was this morning how to explain this kind of service add one child a Fortin in prayer something came to me and I just think it's something altogether different every title this morning is detached when tears shall reap in joy out of old message on the harvest and everything else but this is what I got this morning to bring to you oh you could never figure this thing in I can't figure it out but I know you'll be blessed I feel the Holy Spirit over the building I feel the Holy Spirit over you Thank You Bethany for that song service all right let's go and this is from a message the healed life as a healer notice the Church of the early age they went for from the first three centuries the preach the gospel the healed is sick after that healing miracles begin to die out so people say today that God promised in his word just to be with the fossils and the heal the second it will be primitive age of the church I count that very poor Bible scholar in there's no such Krypton about to prove that God promised in mark 16 his last Commission to the church go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow him I believe they will lay under second they shall recover the first Commission he gifted this chest was the Heelys sick the last commission the gift delicious was to heal the sick he has to be all over the world so the Commission is still in effect isn't that right the unbelievers say that was just to convert the heathens the others I believe the reasons the church lost her place in divine healing or we have a little spirit but is very feeble just enough to move around like somebody about half dead that's about the way the Church of the Living God moves today just about enough to grunt a little while you see I'm not saying that for Jukes but it's the truth just enough courage to go down the children see well I'm a Baptist this Alisha's with power with miracles with sign the one that's command a place where people comfortable how many messages you know YouTube just about as much life as they got that's true some allows it to that I do the same I think if the church listen of the Living God Steve is a place and was freed up and lived in the presence of God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that signs and wonders would be flowing from a like a gush and I think that is where the trouble is you talk about it used to convert heathens that's what God gave it to the church the primitive church was the convert is my dear beloved unbeliever did did you know that there is more Eden study in the world ten times as many as there was two tears of the word is unchristian eyes and the reason we haven't got nowhere is because we have turned all the promises of God into theology into the teaching of some kind of doctrines of men and organization and fail to produce what Jesus said that the signs will follow delivers we put more emphasis on organization and so forth that we have upon the resurrection and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ if we had more prayer meetings instead of sheep suppers and cat parties will be in better offer Christians or glory to God hallelujah they turn the old-fashioned upper room in to supper room or glory to God hallelujah praise God the prayer meetings will do much better and all these theological teaching and explanation I'm anybody said knowledge shall increase but Court promise the tournaments back to the faith of the fathers and theaters all your access the presence of God not your intellect you cap here for presence or glory to God presence have to be accessed or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah let's continue are you with me gets a lot of show [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah somebody real hallelujah the higher has come from your soul but the joy of the Lord you ever see them Pentecostals in their churches happy happy with their pants wearing lipstick I'm the airing and everything at a happy ojik what is good the talking terms and happy and free as ever that's all you ever be and more than that I don't worry lipstick black or the Aryan party no I'm talking about the joypad or give the Lord a shout in the house I'm talking about the joy the joy of the Lord is your strength you are blessed and privileged to come into God's presence the 23rd day of June 2019 [Applause] so let's identify quickly where God put the presents some rubbish in Chapter four let's turn the Genesis 3:4 I'm Brown beginning to speak a little bit he said no my love and precious darling sisters let me please that my love and precious darling scissors do not think I'm trying I reflect upon your loyalty and a gracious precious jewel of womanhood I'm trying to show you here that you were meant that listening to this tea punch I'm not gonna score new and I'm only a servant of the Lord bringing light the Louis and immoralist and most filth eating there is none it is a woman when she is bad salvation is a good woman then fellows like that one but this is were true our let's continue and I'm speaking to all of that low immoral degraded I'm gonna show you here and that the Bible teaches for women not to be preachers and pastors and teachers listen to this behold the man has become one of us now he never said the woman has become one the man has become one to know good and evil Paul said I know I suffer not a woman to teach or usurp authority over a man because Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived Adam was wrong and he knew he was wrong but he was not deceived so continue know therefore the Lord Sevenfold from niganda Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed in the east of Garden of Eden and cherubim with flying sword 10 everywhere watch for his right to keep a sinful condition and what cut him off from it you get that now these cherubim was first mentioned in the East garden and God can't do just little gods or anything like that you have to know what I mean there is the Garden of Eden and there's a gate there that swings out and at this kid there was terrible's now remember he didn't say it cherubim he said cherubims and they were what they was the God the way of the of life who is the way Jesus is the way okay now notice these Chairman's that John saw must have been interested in keeping the Tree of Life so he jumped from Genesis to John Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God they kept the Tree of Life guarded the way of life the way of life he said I am the way I am the bread will come from God know there is a way back to the tree of life and I want to show you know and make this short it's the altar not to say I believe this and believe that not that not that that's intellect nice read right on arithmetic that's what you have to understand the way back to the altar the author's where you bring a sacrifice and the author's where God sends fire upon your sacrifice will get the Lord as so Oh blowing a Cordillera stellar altar you tell me the altar or chlorine oh god get a lot of shout the Holy Spirit I [Music] want to show you know I make it sure it's an altar now this must have been an altar at the God of Eden I'll tell you why do you remember what killing a bear came up to worship so it shows that God's heat and change several ages there was seven mercy seat Oh glory to God seven blood support of course he can on your behalf so God put a moose easy for you or glory that the grace of God by the love of God to be projected to you and we keep you from your sin what said tell me what sin as far as the East is from the West or you have a right they shook this morning when you understand what assault is about what this blood is about what this bump of the blood of Jesus is all about is to loose you and free you from your past from your fears from your sins he's your God can't people see it nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat dear this alt of judgment must become a mercy seat and when this alter if the blood is lifted then we will stand the Judgment Day the fire of God's wrapped the God the tree again the only thing will enter into this gift will be true the blood of Jesus Christ notice Cain and Abel the boys came up with a gate to worship so it must have been God's altar and before this altered he had another altar there was a true altar of God in the heart of man and there's another altar which was representing the holiest of the Holies and the holy place is I feel like speaking in tongues he said can't you see it's perfect the reason I said that because you can't find enough words in my English dialect to express my feeling or glory to God that's why you need to speak in tongues after an altar words after another Thanksgiving you need another language they give göran worship songs from the restored prophecy chorus thought tongues will be restored back in this church prophecies back in the church signs and wonders back in the church give her wisdom give of healing give her miracles all the gifts [Applause] all glory to God hallelujah glory to God amen God in the state Kenan even came up here to worship so it must have been an altar that the God is not right what's the Bible Cain went out from the presence of the Lord from the gate at the garden so the presence of the Lord must have been at the altar and the altar was at the gate it's got 12 verses that the altar Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and God for the presence on the altar and the author was at the gate and kit leave the gate leave the altar walk away from the presence of God no you coming back you coming back to the gate they're coming back to the gate you coming back to the way they're coming back to the altar you coming back in the presence I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'd be with you even in you you come back in the presence a person that will never leave you believe it now believe it this is a word no or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Oh Moses was taken up to him and saw the altar of God now I'm trying to prove my point here you know what I'm trying to do don't you burn see he went up in the presence of God and when he descended from the presence of God God told Moses make everything on earth and after heaven and when he did he made the act of the Covenant he put two cherubim cigar diac so all those who will see what Moses saw so a representation by what he was making concerning the act Oh hallelujah because he manually saw something and God say whatever you see up there make a representation down here or chlorine of course he put the parallels Karen the acts or glory that God let's continue hallelujah mold emotive brass and put their wings touching like this that's exactly what John saw in heaven four turbines on the four sides of the app in the tool of heaven dad in the art scene cherubim that was in Genesis Saint cherubims in Revelation or give the Lord a shout I was sailing and the same cherubim that was in Genesis and this is the scripture these are matrices up to 25 verse 9 to 22 and God speaking the motions according to all that I surely after the pattern of the tabernacle and a pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it they shall make an ark of shittim wood two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof a cubit and a half of the Pradera of a cubit and a half the height thereof don't are overlaid with pure gold within without overly make it upon a crown of gold upon them those are cast four rings of gold for it put them in four corners thereof is your specific it is pouring shall be on one side two rings on the other side don't make stabs of shittim wood over liniment gold don't I'll put the Stars into the rings on the side of the AK the app will born with them the star shall be rings of the ark they shall not be taken from it though shall put the AK the testimony which I give thee thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof a cubit and a half the breadth thereof thou shalt take pool children's of gold beaten work shalt don't make them and the two ends of the mercy seat and make one cherub on one and the other sharp on the other end even of the mercy seat shall you meet the cherubs on twins and the chairman's shalt stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings and their fish al look one to another towards the mercy shall to face the challenge and also I put the mercy seat above the ark under the Act also I put the testimony I will give thee and I will meet with thee o glorious go and I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two children's wish upon the Ark of testimony of all things I will give thee the commandment under the chiller Israel or give the Lord a shout Florrie Dugger there was an order there was an approach that was a weird there was a tingle specified I will meet you there doesn't that sound familiar thought let's continue know that God the mercy seat when God is in the Shekinah glory where was this energy category at the mercy seat they God the Shekinah glory people who listen friends then it goes to shows that every scallywag cannot come dear and take of that you have got to be repaired before you come into the presence of it so God but God's around the altar and wrong in mercy seat around the presence that any and anybody can take up and walk with it or give it law some prison so that is why I said presence must be accessed you have to be given access to the presence of God anyone can read or listen to the word because it is written and spoken but presence must be accessed you must have access or given access to the presence of God the main is where the war is at with thoughts and words the battle in the main but the presence of God comes into the heart and as there is where things are settled [Applause] [Music] hallelujah yeah is where things are settles not in the head in the heart and out of the half half comes the issues of life so the batter said God your heart bullying old thing come inside your heart don't let nobody is speaking to your life that my call to speak into your life cut them off make sure the right person speaking to you cut them off cut out the negative cut down the unbelief quato godless Oh glory to God one time but at random had a man in his cat remind spoke he say broke a blue streak and break the anointing off of him everybody else weaken the right thing you know everybody o'clock to speak to you you know Hawkgirl give the Lord some places and Dolan embodies speak and get the anointing of your life God put a dimension upon your life what gives a lot of shout if you believe God put that imagine upon your life give the Lord a show God put it upon your life in a solid not because you're nice not because you're tall not because you're special he put it because he put it he put it because your name is on that book he chose you you didn't shoot any chose you that's why you're supposed to get in prison [Applause] lori's some sharing with you some inspiration Gordon bring to me hallelujah Israel they were in bondage for hundred years bondage when in bundles you want to get out you want to go

your gifts you have God give them to you God can take it back God get give you a gift of sing I'll give to preach a gift a exhort I give to give whatever gift God give you let's God give you that it's built in it's who you yield that gift to you could sing for the Lord or sing for the devil that's who you want the yield to give to it up well gifted people out there singing for Lucifer beautiful voice but they're not singing for the right person are you with me Alleluia Baram says don't try any person it he said there's too many trying to impersonate they got the Holy Ghost there's too many trying to poison it divine healing there's too many people trying to push their different things of the Lord you can't do that that comes by election oh praise God but if God calls you you are the most thankful person in the world because he has called you then it becomes real to you they mean God really called me yes you mean the devil was messing with your mind all along yes you mean he was bluffin you yes what attracts the Holy Ghost it's the correct in you it's what in you and this is something that struck me the power is from the source not the gift some music and can play you can play guitar piano organ whatever than hands going because the gift are gift up there music no spirit you know just hands moving premature hands that's hands but if you get that musician connected to the power source [Music] is a little more than hands moving it is a spirit moving upon them same hands and the music the same music becomes inspired the plan becomes inspired I say her to sing because ever gift to sing open your mouth and words come out and song come out that's a hue and a gift but if the power saw us get connected to that singing gift or glory to God the devil in trouble Oh glory

he died they know he had risen they had talked to him on the way but that was the thing for them or what but here under their Pentecost the Holy Spirit the abstract fell upon the believers that made him part of his resurrection it made him part of his fellowship the Holy Spirit came and confirmed to them that they would be raised up because they were potentially raised from cowards to praise them they were afraid of the very word that they taught I read it again they were afraid of the very word that they had taught don't let this pass over you they were afraid they know that he was the word but they were afraid all glory to God isn't that right but all of a sudden here come the Holy Spirit from heaven and it's quicken them and the equipment took place there wasn't afraid to make a

quickening power he walked for five hundred years or more and not one time he missed his word but one time did he miss me of himself not what time did he do but keep the testimony everything God

praise God praise God Oh glory to God Amen God gifts is his word God promised me a gift sent a gift you take the gift and then with his word there's a conductor with the gift of God the word is the gift and God put the wood inside of you and the word is the conductor if you do have the word you can't get the conduct of the spirit because it split up the flow to something and or spirit through into the word the Pentecostal feel because it didn't have the word what give the Lord a shout when the Spirit slipped the Pentecostals they didn't have the word because the Prophet William Branham was bringing the word but no he brought the word the secret is the word is in the bride no the word is in you the word isn't me then we become channels of God we become channels of the Spirit that will conduct the spirit or Florida gotcha you have to be under expectation to see the conductor of the Spirit the spirit conducting to the word so here program says the word is a conductor of the Spirit

listen to this he said watch when the first vine come forth the first branch that come out of the way was a Pentecostal branch with visions powers healings baptism the Holy Spirit create signs and wonders the next branch will have to be the same kind of branch Oh glory to God I think this is a final quote I have and I'll be done as a quote that you know the 7 angels message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11 our gentle workers to receive the same pay that the first our workers got I want to emphasize an underline and broad like st. pay not have people not want to pay same tape August big seals opening up all this big mystery on sunset mountain and cloud and angel talk that we talking for all these years the purpose of that is that we receive something simply all glory to God hallelujah so the even time message is to restore again to bring that same thing back get ready but Anthony so brother was telling them about some orange tree and then was grafted in lemon and great food and all kind of stuff he said this sucker Liz of the strength of the vine it lives because the citrus fruit a lemon will grow in an orange tree but it will not the oranges do it lives by its life and the church so call only a crafted chuckle living under the name of religion suckers pulling from the strength of the rain so God has up suckers in this message drawing from the message but representing themselves representing their own teachings and ideas only and what not that's what they represent him they not say anybody tipsy they're not saying what they prophesy they say in their own thing sometime they call hidden mysteries hidden mysteries are kind of foolish things but there's no more he said his spirit and Lee Brian the Prophet will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the world so we kept pushing on new thing what be saying you could read any message or glory of God you have the guarantee that what we've seen is the word Oh blow

cannot be manifested it cannot be vindicated only by the moon said I am the light of the world the world so there's got to come for a power people don't like us to say that because they feel they have it already but I am saying in happy to get just got to come for the power the holy sprit himself the right one or to vindicate or to prove to make that is what he predicted what happened the evening
