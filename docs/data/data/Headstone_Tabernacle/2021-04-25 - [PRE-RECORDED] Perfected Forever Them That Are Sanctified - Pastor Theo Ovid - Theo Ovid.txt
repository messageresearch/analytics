in the precious name of jesus his name becomes more precious every day greetings and happy father's day to all the fathers among us it's a privilege a blessing and honor to be a father [Music] it's part of what god himself desire to be but he is so longing in him to express fatherhood and he longing for us to become fathers in god in the gospel in maturity not children not young men but fathers amen adopted sons hallelujah it is good pleasure that will be adopted he's not scratching his head wondering he wants us to be adopted but because of his love and his honor he has to keep his word judgment is not god vexed with people it's not god angry with people judgment is the nature of god because of his justice unrighteousness hallelujah that is what makes him god and we appreciate him and we love him oh praise god so god bless you again and welcome we certainly appreciate each one of you coming out here this morning and we had a really powerful prayer meeting on tuesday night and i bought an exhortation [Applause] from isaiah 40 every mountain every mountain and hill shall be made low the crooked and even pace made straight level rough places made plain and then you're going to see the glory of god does he amplify the voice of one christ be pae in the wilderness preparing the way of the lord say clear away obstacles make straight and smooth in the desert a highway for our god so the valleys have to get built up the mountains have to get level the crooked places have to make straight and the rough places get smooth in order to make a way for the glory of god to begin to roll down upon your life isn't that right you talk about the mountains the fully hard resistant areas in your life of pride and unbelief critical attitudes and self-righteousness isn't that right talk about the rough places becoming smooth inconsistencies in your lives harshness in relationships to others being impatient and irritable but this one caught me second corinthians 7 14 with my people not not anybody if my people god is very specific he's not talking about others he said my people that are called by my name shall shall humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways then you're going to hear from heaven god going to heal your land humble yourself and that speaks of brokenness pray pray to realize your dependency upon god i love this one to see god face intimate relationship i'm gonna do with friends and talk and you're watching in front of some i said silman listen no no that's you seeking his face turn from your wicked ways repentance that's the only way to turn from what you're doing you have to repent repentance in the wrong like something i preached a while ago about to please god you have to have an intent to please god if you want to improve on your marriage your relationship you have to have an intent for that you can't just say you want to improve you want to do this no you have to intent you want to study you have to have an intent and then the desire to study and other things will be added to that but if you don't have an intent to change you'll see just as you are and nothing could really move you and change you that is why we read the scripture last service about jesus asking that young man if you want to be perfect in other words i'm not going to force you you know yourself you you do this you do that you did it but if you wanna be perfect you have something to give up you have something to let go you have to release some of this stuff in your life in order to make room for perfection to really get a hole upon you because you really want this world to become flesh you really want that you have been church long enough but you don't want that no more you want this word to become flesh the bible said and the word became flesh and well among us it's got to come into your flesh do you believe that amen so four things here humble pray seek god's face turn from wicked ways that's on our side that's what god asked us if we could do that then revival is guaranteed on its way then if we do that he said he's going to hear our prayer he's going to forgive our sins and he's going to heal our land could we give the lord a shout our praise so pride flows and shows itself in independence self-centeredness arrogance when you're praying you show how much you depend upon god isn't that right and the answer to pride is brokenness broken [Music] brokenness is what i know for [Music] brokenness is what i need [Music] brokenness [Music] is what you want from me from me righteousness righteousness righteousness [Music] [Music] what you want from me from me my life [Music] it or give him some praise right now [Applause] [Music] yes oh jesus take my life [Music] [Music] [Music] you may be seated before we go into the scriptures [Music] i want to bring something to you but remember church you're living in the best day you will ever live in right now until jesus comes it will not gradually but rapidly get worse and worse when russia goes down there for that oil look out that all she needs that's what the prophet said it would do and then we're ready for it then in 1914 the world went to war and there had never been a peace since constantly swinging swinging swinging they're holding they're doing the very same thing yet what was they doing holding he said oh god have mercy holding that great thing i saw in the vision the whole thing becoming the destruction holding the atomic holding the wars that they don't destroy themselves until the thing come to destroy until israel turns back and get herself together then the message will go to israel and she'll be sealed with the seal of the holy ghost after the gentile is called out the people for his namesake will be called out and the israel receive a trina year six-month message so we know but i'm saying that seven visions which is a muslim the past before jesus comes again the seventh vision is where america was bombed up you still talk about i know we did this before but i feel that to do it again he said the america built two horns civil ecclesial powers lamb freedom of religion but after a while they spoke like a dragon people who follow the pillar of fire will certainly have a rough time but they are ready for the translation at that time ready to go so i want you to understand it's no picnic because they were called chosen and faithful the elected of god now watch watch there is a fear who knew not joseph what was joseph represented question answer the spiritual part of a spiritual exodus now bear in mind the first exodus was a natural land to a natural land to the land of canaan the second exodus was from a natural land canaan land into a spiritual baptism in the upper room the third exodus is from a spiritual baptism into the land of the millennium that's the third exodus so what ram is saying here is prophecy he said what does joseph represent he said the spiritual part in this spiritual exodus that is what joseph represents their watch their races up now we are freedom the woman nourished over time but finally a pharaoh dictator this is coming to america now who knew not the freedom of religion uniting them together don't let this pass you there come a time where there was a pharaoh first had to come there was a pharaoh who raised up who knew not joseph and that was the beginning of the beginning that was the beginning of the exodus so once you see pharaoh raising up you know we on our way out of here oh hallelujah because pharaoh raising up means moses is coming to deliver the people sethi had to die and the next man to raise up who knew not joseph i don't have to read everything here but while ramsay is growing in power moses growing in power while the dictator risen in power the pride rising in power god even leave us like this oh i'm feeling something now hallelujah so you recognize this is not for church members just all church remember what is the church to go to all right let's read a little further all right there's the pharaoh who raised up who knew not joseph that was the beginning of the exodus and when that thing began to form one under a political power begin to form form god begin to get ready the iniquity of the america was fulfilled the time that the promised abraham was fulfilled the time of deliverance was at hand god permitted a fear to rise up raise up who knew not joseph and ramsay was born after satikan ramses and ramses was not was the one who knew not the blessings of joseph he uh watched and he didn't know what the spiritual side was and i think if any man was spiritual could see what's taking place now we are getting a pharaoh who knows not freedom of religion and at that time he was saying this when our president took his office he would not swear that he believed in freedom of religion this is 963 to exodus but there raised up affair who knew not joseph the same thing today a man has raised up took oat in the white house i will not swear to this oat will not take his oath that he believes in freedom of religion when this new pope you talk about i'll skip that let's go a little further at the time ramsay's in egypt was growing his power was growing the natural man ramsay was growing the natural man the antichrist is growing now through politics not religious yet oh my god all right true politics all right he already got to the white house in religion he got the people scooped up till they already they actually will fall right for it and the denominational leaders practically everyone every church that's in this nation is already in the confederation of churches ramses is growing they're all united together and what they have what does it do it makes a power a beast like the first one now there's a persecution coming upon all those who won't unite with it and a boycott it will be too late then you already took the mark don't say i'll do it then you better do it now ramses was growing remember while ramsay was going in power god had moses in the wilderness he was growing too so it has to have a bride on earth growing too they have to have a bride coming into power if the be system coming into power there's got to be a move of the spirit of god upon a bright bunch called by seven thunders because seven thunders canada right together get the bright faith to call for power to the god to have a seventh time the bunch [Applause] hallelujah they are brought growing it will be a shorter one of these days the time ain't far off when there will be a showdown so what's happening in your home there's a showdown they're not even a bear lion or even goliath you mean your little family issues and challenges you can't deal with it in a christian manner i didn't mean to go there this morning that's the pastoral part okay so watch look at the church now calling out coming into power oh man here we go watch as the scripture says the natural type is spiritual it's the truth look at the church now calling out coming into power this is but the holy spirit coming down the mysteries of god being revealed and set in order and right she is reading the white house the church is pulling himself together not a denomination out of the bondage of iniquities i just love that away from the amorite are people that's free oh glory to god out of the bondage of iniquities that is knowing to do right and doing wrong you coming out of all of that you're doing the right thing you're saying the right thing you're thinking the right thing you're speaking the writing you must come out right [Applause] you have nothing to go and make right you made what you have to make right you make it right you have nothing to repent of you already repent of your what you have to done you repent of it the blood is splashed all over you then you are justified giving evidence and you're free your heart free you have confidence to say father let the fire fall they lay hands upon the sick they have to recover because you have faith you have no apology for anybody you walk you walk you fall you get back up you're a son of god you're a daughter of god you're not now gonna be saved oh we have a bump for you this morning hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah hallelujah you know not getting saved you're not the first recruit you're a soldier they never see as a soldier oh glory to god you're going to fight for every inch you're going to get your promise you're going gonna overcome you're gonna get the victory [Applause] so are you ready for the word this morning or could we stan one or two of the bibles ephesians chapter four one verse verse 11 to 13 and hebrews chapter 10 verse 11 through 17. ephesians 4 verse 11 and they give some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry for the eddy fan of the body of christ to be all come in the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ and hebrews chapter 10 from verse 11 we read every pre-standard daily ministering an offering of times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of god from henceforth expecting till his enemies we made his footstool for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified whereof the holy ghost also be a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with in those days said the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquity will remember no more let's pray father we thank you for your word blessed to our hearts lord i wait on you lord make the world be transformed into the lives and hearts of the people we ask in jesus name may your spirit come and confirm your word to them amen amen you may be seated oh praise the lord oh thank you lord jesus when the dynamic struck the pentecostals they could not come to perfection why this is very important because people looking for spirit they're looking for power but the pentecostal got power and spirit and it didn't come true that powerful testimonies they were speaking in tongues they were healing the sick cast now devils the other testimony woman one time they were cut people got so vexed they got shotguns and shoot at them and the bullet just fallen off their clothing without even harming them powerful miracles powerful testimonies the anointing was blocks away before you even reached a church people were falling on the streets from the dynamic power that was released 1906 pentecostal revival you heard what i said blocks away from the church itself where they were gathered together the people were being healed in the streets the people will fall along in the streets didn't even have to read the church the glory and the anointing and the power was emanating from inside out to the people you just had to be dear they had testimony piano playing by itself people got gifts of playing and music when they just get it they just have to play like if they always play in all kind of miracles and power yet they couldn't come to perfection hallelujah so it takes something more than just spirit [Music] it takes the word and the spirit so god sent the prophet with the word and the pentecostal rejected the prophet and to this day they still have all the gifts they had since way back then because you cannot come to perfection by gifts come on now come on now not your preaching gifts not your teaching gifts not your not your not your tongue speaking gifts you have to only come to perfection by the word jesus christ hallelujah you have to be caught in that perfection i feel blessed this morning to know out of millions of people not then i come to this message you know that i've been called to perfection it's a little more than just come into this message in an endless call to this message but praise god have no perfection that they're getting from it at all they have interpretation so the pentecostal did not could not take the word that brings discipline to be formed into the word image that god would approve sons this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased remember when brother bryan went through someone in pentecost he told he was among angels all supernatural and power of god this was the spirit of god and whatnot until a vision broke and he saw one of those gifted men living with somebody else who was not his wife then that toy meant a spin what on earth is this it was the genuine holy ghost it was genuine spirit operating but something was wrong in the inner man so he went into the cave to ask god what is this and the god opened the scriptures hebrew six i believe it was to show him the rainfall on the just and the unjust amen it's the holy ghost but the seed is not there it produces a different life [Applause] come on now come on now so it's not just spirit but a seed which is the word so then he had to reveal son of man who is the sower of the seed oh hallelujah so we today have a revelation of the words of the son of man come on now come on now come on now that's why we can quote it that's why we can preach it that's why we can stay with it because this is not the words of a man it's the revealing of the son of man oh hallelujah [Applause] some people say we can't preach we had a cold rap we can't preach um no quote no no we can't preach oh yeah we can't preach i can't preach i don't have my own message when the angel came in with the book open that was the message i am not the angel i didn't bring down the book i didn't open the book i couldn't look upon the book only lamb was worthy he took the book he opened the book he loosed the seals and he gave it to the prophet who gave it to us hallelujah did you get that he gave it to our prophet to give it to us and now we stand here in the book prophesying from the book because the word said prophesy again bring back the prophecies so you are sitting today under a seventh under revelation that gave us the insight of the seeds to show for seven thunder manifestation oh give the lord a shout our praise you're not sitting here in vain you're not believing here in vain you actually under a servant under inspiration that brings light on the word to show what seeds to show for our seven thunder manifestation in other words you have got this morning a capstone revelation waiting for a capstone manifestation nothing going to stop it daniel already saw the stone cut it without the hands of man no money bringing the stone oh i'll give the lord a scream a shout in the house listen listen if these so-called super ministers super preachers big preachers mighty men are all kinda gonna bring it why is not here after all these 50 plus years because they can't bring it no man could bring dynamics if they got to send it dynamic is going to be a reaction to our action oh glory to god did you hear what i said [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] god deliberately shut up the heavens and loose sun's in the earth say sons of golden last days they're going to unlock the heavens have supporters unlock you know hallelujah is atmosphere talking to atmosphere that's why she is telling tyri in the upper room until he be drew with power from on him and revelation always brings stimulation and the reason the people not excited and in the spirit because they really lack revelation they have intellectual understanding but when you get revelation it makes you get excited it makes you get stimulated wine is revelation water is water but wine give it up oh yes oh yes oh yes why make you misbehave yourself this time i stagger a little bit you must stand up a little bit you can find a raising hand a little bit you might see him say smiling you don't know why you're smiling but you're happy happy happy you ever see a drunk man you ever see a drinking man he's smiling smiling smiling while we smiling this morning because we're smiling with revelation that god made a promise he's going to bring it to pass you wanna be seated i didn't give your house burning last night if god gave revelation you'd be shouting this morning because another house is coming somebody stole your cat another cat coming you lose your job have a next job dear all things worked at every place you put your foot is yours no devil could no weapon formed come on no don't don't help me oh don't get me started here this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] i now realize i haven't given you the title my goodness the title is perfected forever them that are sanctified that's the title perfected forever them that are sanctified subject coming into that perfection inspiration let us go on to perfection so i know i didn't finish the message i didn't get in the message last week actually last week it was just like a call introduction also hoping that this morning we could get on into it praise god so but abandoned prophesied that the unfolding of the sevenfold mysteries of god would bring on another ephesians in ephesians what we read today we have a promise of a fightful ministry of pastor prophet teacher evangelist apostle plus the perfecting of the saints so god himself put the perfecting of the saints in ephesians he himself put it there [Applause] so we can't go around it we have to go into it all right in other words perfection will be in another ephesians that is the promise therefore the anointing will be only upon the promises the seeds that was promised for the bride i could stand here and give you information about time magazine jews israel that's not the promise of the bribe we can explain the vials the wars the plagues the woman and the sun between the first round is seven vial sex violence seven vile and one of those stuff that's not what we're here for [Applause] the seeds that are promised to the bride therefore all men's ideas all men's interpretation of what the prophet said would die every group every church that twists and turn and interpreted it will die the only thing that would stand is those that stand on the promises as the prophet said it and spoke it because peter said by these promises we become partakers of the divine nature so what the prophet came to introduce was a land of promise it's the holy ghost land of promise in the form of word word on top of word on top of where on top of words [Applause] as far as the devil is concerned you wasting time coming to church because that's fine what he's seeing you're not producing anything but he's a liar he don't understand what god is doing this is what the devil don't get my word shall not return unto me boy what did child accomplish [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my god i feel a power i feel a faith in the building this morning or anything could happen oh yes anything can happen you're rocking under the world you actually under anything can happen inside of here [Applause] remember season when is there anything but over they mean anything yes missing kidneys can be restored got to bring back teeth heart mind life foot toe got to reverse back diabetes cancer [Applause] nothing outside of what he could do i could drop a question on you is anything too hard for our god not the lord our god glory you may be seated listen go go give you a testimonial you're gonna have a testimony you know your neighbor have to hear about your god your friends gonna hear about god not talking no they're gonna hear about the god of joshua the god of moses the god of isaac the god of jacob he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the god we serve this morning he's a god of power he's a god of omnipotence he's a god that delivers he's a god and make a way where there is nowhere oh he could straighten the crooked eye he could cause the to walk cause the blind to see that the god we serve he can heal your home he could heal your marriage he could heal the relationship yes he could bring back your wayward son the way one that's the god do i hear a shout in the house [Applause] you may be seated oh glory to god don't let nobody take away your license to make noise if there is no noise there is no god oh anybody trying to revoke your license the devil where there is god you're gonna find some noise or give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] yes don't worry one day you'll be looking for more words and none will be coming out it's just glorious just glory just glory there's glory there's glory there's glory the minister will not be able to will not be able to minister because something bigger than him something more powerful than him something more majestic than him oh glory to god you hearing a preacher but there is somebody anointing that preacher there is ministering spirits descending on this morning to minister to you who are heirs of salvation oh glory to god demons are on the run this morning all right let me be seated [Applause] like that hallelujah oh that's that song so good it means praise the lord okay so don't know that that that could be interpreted praise the lord you're speaking in tongues hallelujah got it for bc hallelujah 24 elders say praise the lord this one ten thousand time thousands begin to worship you can't come here and let them out worship you you are earthly angels they are heavily injured god put you here to worship does not make him god that's what make him your god anybody could go to a lecture and a preacher and listen and listen good you know and take notes you know there's no worshipping that's taking notes anybody could do that but what you're doing anybody can do that is you have to be there before the foundation of the world he said where was though when i lay the foundation of the earth his son's back dear attribute sons of his spirit you were in his thinking that's why you could show no you have problems but that's that's behind you oh hallelujah your problems is in time but he's in eternity and you are connecting this morning with eternity and eternity is more powerful than time oh hallelujah let's close our time this morning let's push time aside let's break into eternity [Applause] yes [Applause] god being infinite who cannot lie cannot speak anything contrary amen knows everything just as perfect as in the beginning as he is at the ending just as perfect at the end he was in the beginning god is endless like eternity you can never find the corner of a perfect circle you could run through all the ages and eternity it will never have an end to it that's the way god is he is infinite and perfect he always will be the same he can never change he is perfectly the same now this great chain of perfection was broken by time space oh my god i'm in my own world here this morning i'm in my own world here this morning he said that great circle that chain of perfection was broken by time space time came because of sin the circle was eternity but time broke it listen to these words let's see a perfect circle and my wife was a little hicky a little drop in the chain eternity continues on but it's not in perfect condition there's a little gap breaks over this way god had to do that because satan caused it and it dropped down to space of time for trying and the perfecting and the persian of the loss remember remember we bypass our tiophony to be put on earth to be tested and tried that's why time space come on there's a purpose of times peace to get us perfected because when the devil kicked that little kick kicking and and we broke into time space we have to get back into eternity we cannot go back to eternity perverted we have to go back to eternity perfect but he has perfected forever them that are sanctified so you're going to understand why jesus died to bring blood my god forgive me i'm excited this morning jesus died to bring blood sanctifying blood blood that you could understand when he looked through that blood he don't see your thoughts he don't see your mistakes he don't see your failures he see you perfected [Applause] perfection guaranteed [Music] okay so watch god had to do that because it didn't cause it to drop down to space time for the trial and the perfecting and the position of the loss that god by sovereign grace might someday lift that little hiki or gap back into a perfect circle then she rolls on just the same time now time is this little loop it loops down jesus was from eternity to eternity but he stepped into time space and was made flesh and came through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across the place to redeem it to connect it back to god for eternity you help me my god i feel like going across the horizontal rainbow my god i feel like that oh man this place don't have enough room for me this morning did you hear what he did jesus broke through time space come down here to bring the blood to redeem us to reconnect us back or to that ah and i cashed out this morning my god hallelujah [Applause] you see that's all time is then god when it started here the little kink in a perfect circle a little kink in it when god started here he was perfect everything was perfect everything he does is perfect now look before oh my goodness before are you ready before he ever put the printed word this is the mind of god here it is this is the mind of god that he thought before the foundational world was ever laid that's the reason he could put it on printed word [Applause] and say what it would be because you saw it before the foundation it's like you're reading the novel the novel of past personal future in it if it's a mystery book you could go on the end and see who who do what who's the mystery the person you don't want to read the whole thing you wouldn't get the joy of it of course who done it you go to the end and say oh okay she she done it close the book there is no joy whatsoever because why you are out of the book but you could read present in the book pass in the book future in the book that's god [Applause] because he is an eternity he could see past presence and future your future is already done god requires a thing that i pass my god your victory already won glory the quad halal you're already healed my already delivered you're going to process you're going to process double cash stop it your foot your devils is under your feet oh he's under my feet he's under my feet he's under my feet he's under my feet oh glory to god [Applause] come on you sons of god give the lord a shout ride with me you may be seated he saw it before the function of the world and knew just what it would be and spoke it out and he handed down his knowledge to the prophets [Music] so heaven consists of the word so because god had foreknowledged he could drop back in time and the word of the lord came under his eye saying the word of lord came unto jeremiah seeing him so these men had the gift to go up into the space of god and pull down knowledge of god speak to the people prophesy son of man to prophesy what those seers i looked and i saw and i prophesy give them the gifts of vision and so on god have his people he has to get the word to the people because that's to how you're going to be redeemed you can be redeemed by his word why because you are thought and the word comes to express you the word come to connect with you so i do carefully as a professor if you're a gardener a farmer a kitchen worker i don't care what you are the world has to come to you this eternal god had to find you in trinidad i had to find you in your state i had to find you in your country he couldn't you couldn't miss it if you try whether on a bus whether by the beach weather in the park whether in a car somebody had to pass this world to you [Applause] you may be seated so before you were born before you were born god had done put things in place for your parents to be in the right spot to get somebody to tell them about the gospel of jesus about the love of jesus you were when your baptist church your mother was a methodist or pentecostal church or adventist church your mother was attained obedient because god gonna find you there you like a baby a baby methodist you gotta be meant for this i believe baptist you don't know baby baptist i believe any gospel you know baby pentecostal you are son and daughter of god going in some pentecostal church but when that eagle when eternity come long in time and the voice of god thunders oh hallelujah you hear something like where you heard before you hear a voice and you know is that your mother voice is not your father voice it's your heavenly father's voice you may be she said muslim couldn't stop that hinduism concept that methodist couldn't stop that buddha couldn't accept that when that voice thunder every seed out of every nation ultravery tongue out of every people a people for his name sick aren't you happy this morning to be a people called out [Applause] [Music] you may be seated you see you see the others out there don't know the end from the beginning we don't in that sense but we know all things work together for good oh yes they see the self making more money getting more cars getting more houses i'm doing on killing the life out and they have seen 60 coming for them 70 80 and then they're sure they will see 90. and that encounter the same god we're preaching about here right now every day every day every sunday we preaching about that same god but if they cross that barrier and meet him they meet in him who we preaching about therefore if you get in contact with him and him call you you should be the most shouting individual in this building this morning because only who we phone you who he found you who is on you be called [Applause] but mine you may see that if i could sing this in your heart this morning the next stage of that and who he called he justified if that could hit you this morning you'd be running up and down this building justified it's as if you never did it as if it never fell as if he never sinned as if he never failed if you could get there this morning this was one of the most powerful churches on this island you may decide because justification will be clear to you before you could see perfection [Applause] because you are perfected forever them that are sanctified because when you understand this justification you would want to be perfectly completely sanctified to please him who has called you [Applause] every priest stand let me just read something here i want to read the amplified of that scripture we read from hebrews 10. furthermore every human priest stands at his altar of service ministering daily offering the same sacrifices over and over again which never are able to strip from every side of our sins that envelop us from taking them away what a vain sort of thing same sacrifices same sacrifices and you know no results in a certain sense wasting time whereas this one christ not some pastor not some bishop of canterbury not some pope this man christ after he offered a single sacrifice no i like how they describe a minute because they compared it to all them bloods and bulls and all them they often yeah and yelled yeah and yelled that not doing the work it's just giving a conscious well something take my place you know the lamb dead the ox killed i was supposed to go there but they killed that one so next year they had to kill the next one again because my heart deceitfully corrupt there was no power to bring a change within the heart system this man offered a single sacrificial sins that shall reveal for all time and sat at the right hand of god waiting for his enemies should be made stool on these feet you know they're coming that's the confidence of the blood that's the confidence of the world we know we're coming to victory you know you're coming into victory do you know you're coming into power do you believe it coming into power you have to believe it you know muhammad ali you say i am the greatest i'll knock you down in wrongs number two then fellas trembling before them clearing and no no wrong number two out they go because he said he's the greatest i ain't tell you to go and say the greatest now all i'm telling you is to believe what god said and you have to believe it so bad it slipped from your conscious into the subconscious [Applause] so after a while you're living from your subconscious level a christian life how the devil could touch that my god god taken the control tower of your heart devil take your head but god take your heart and by revelation you are justified oh my god you are free this morning some of you don't know you're free somebody remind me of johnny crow he was tied by that tree so long he kept going on a circle in a circle in a circle somebody come and cut the cord and he's still going in a circle because he was tight so long you may be seated that's how they train every fun center all them big big elephant they tied them and they were babies right by the pole right there and everything afterwards believed that six features a circle that's only going when they come big they could cut them now and it's 650 again domesticated don't let the devil domesticate you and say you go to you so far and no more you sure you want to press on there you sure you want to pray a little more why are you going past five minutes i see our improvement you're going to seven don't let them fool you you're wasting your time but you have to tell the devil if my people god said so that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways then i'm gonna hear from heaven he's going to forgive me my sins are he going to heal my land now listen when your land not heal the fake doesn't want to bring forth on them and even if they bring forth a little too big bible don't be fictional yield in their strength [Applause] god's going to bless your corn your wine listen you're blessing with the flow you know don't you want that [Applause] don't you want god to prepare a table for you in the presence of your enemy listen prepare your closure though because god have a chair for the sit down at that table you know come on now you got to prepare yourself hey this bride this woman is never like no no no no you know how long jesus waiting for this bride this bribe will not fail you know [Music] i don't care if you don't see amen on that that is still the truth this bribe will not fail he failed not this eve god raised this eve up listen not to fail in the book it's it not failing [Applause] no no no look look at the paradox of that we are born in sin shape iniquity lying tongue as a bib and god said not feeling amen [Music] gospel that's good news it means god had to do something to make that possible to make rank sinners like us come into a position of power a position of authority [Applause] my god this man jesus by one sacrifice let me read though for by a single offering he has forever completely cleansed and perfected those who are consecrated and made holy oh my and the holy spirit has this testimony in confirmation to this that in disagreement or testament of covenant i will set up and conclude with them after those days said the lord i will imprint my laws upon their hearts i will inscribe them on their minds on their innermost thoughts and understanding a new heart i'll give you a new spirit i'll put within you and i'll put my spirit into your spirit and cause you to manifest my word it's not your legalism it's not your long dress and you don't wear airing underwear makeup is not that hard if that could bring perfection then the bunch of branhamites and all the people in this message perfected a long time but i want to tell you christ my one sacrifice has perfected forever them that are sanctified perfection that a new thing is not a no thing it's the before the foundation of the word thing that's why let us go on to perfection perfected how long till the next time you get your oats with your neighbor this is not my words no this is about the brand till the next time you see somebody some man or woman that's lustful until the next time you see a chance to tell a big lie until the next time you see somebody that can them driving away from church okay he said he has signified forever perfected forever forever save forever say forever again said lord forever he has perfected forever [Applause] jesus saint john 17 sanctify them by their truth thy word is truth jesus said it and they were sanctified tell them they're not sanctified you go and tell them disciples they're not sanctified amen jesus said sanctified and if jesus said it why am i to question it i'm not going to argue with jesus if jesus said you are perfected forever jesus said that [Applause] no listen peter was going through the night crisis not once three times [Applause] [Music] [Music] but that could not stop pieces are matching up into the upper room [Applause] i'm not hearing you where are those matches where are those speakers they were sanctified and afraid they were sanctified and hiding in a place called the upper room they didn't want to go in the lower room they went up higher should the authorities go have some kind of problems get up there maybe they block up these tears fall you know maybe they prove these staircases nothing going in nothing going out the waiting under a revelation of the understanding being open they're waiting under revelation of they come from god they're going back to god they're waiting under a revelation that they are seeds of the righteous waiting for water to fall they await him for dynamics they are waiting for revival they are waiting to be enjoyed poor from on high oh and we are waiting this morning and i know it's coming i could feel it i could sense it i know it in my spirit oh god my faith speaks it oh glory of god for my one offering not year by year not revival after revival not meeting after meeting not day after day you see you've got to get the field you've got to get the condemnation of you got it it has to come out you know you have to see something bigger than you powerful what you had to become and that's what i love about jesus he didn't baby them and say the same works i do all the rascals i can't give you that promise yet if you shall say no do it didn't say call it because i'm saying the wrong thing no he keep presenting what they have to become you become what you behold [Music] you've got to see a mirror and see what you are to become not what you was you're not looking back into the backward mirror it's a mirror that looks towards what you are to become so you talk like it you walk like it yo your fellowship but other people like it you have blessing of life precious fate not present that that that deflating your feet then you driving good good and somebody come shh you said i'm too long by them they empty your tire and you're flat then you had to call the pastor then we had to jack up the car and then we had to bring some kind of thing to pump in the pool please don't fellowship with anybody ever deflate your face your fate anybody pulling you up lifting you up and you that's the people that's the kind of people you want around your life not not madam negative not brother negative and brother it's a person who negative you know i brought it to him like he born late that way he's communicating to this but what do you do with that i can't explain that i i i don't know i leave that alone i say brother just don't miss the rapture just don't miss you after this that this could be too late for the rapture you're born late your business is late come in later what did i i i'm not going inside of there just try try try to be early enough to make the rapture oh hallelujah for one offering perfected forever them that are scientific but around there you are that's the answer to the debt of christ that's the answer to calvary he absolutely with his own blood purchase all sins and perfected forever his believers therefore in christ we stand blameless perfected in the presence of god almighty oh that i want not to resonate resonate inside your system in christ stop condemning your wife stop condemning your husband stop condemning this one and stop it see them in christ they're going to get in christ or i'll say it this way brahma said when the bride gets a revelation of opposition in the word in christ in other words there's two things happening here the word coming to you and you have to come to the word and you have to come into position to recognize who you are you're no longer a son of a uh uh mr mrs branham he said whose son am i now it was something was breaking into whose son of my know whose daughter are you now so when you break out of this family stuff that is so limited and you break into your sonship stuff you see peter was slowly getting it that's why people can say lord is that as you beat me to come because you're talking to me so long it looks like whatever you do i could do too come on now you don't hear what i'm saying come on come on preach back to me somebody peter a cinnamon say lord is that you beat me to come because i look like whatever you could do we could do too because you say we are sons of god and i want to do what you do and call me i ain't going all day on my own but you call me i ask you to believe if you call me i can do it too come on see me somebody come and give the lord a shout in the house well jesus said come amen and peace has to come walking on water no people putting glass and water hunting and walking on it and me because who can impersonation thing like if they're walking in the water then when you check out it's something like lasting the per day humans again trying to get some kind of notice talk about impossible impersonators people looking like trying to walk like like walking in the air like that chokers and right now you know what we're doing we're leaping over unbelief this service is a jumping we we have job since we hit perfection you jumping over the devil to find your personal it going out so he had to try to blow up your pass try to find because you're purified by by the word the word is purifying you this morning and the word could so purify you the devil can't even try to bring back things to your mind you have to rethink and re-strategize how to get to you because god putting you in the cocoon of his silence did you hear what i said god put something over you an insider there where the devil can't see it's god's private dressing room god is transforming you from a worm to a butterfly you always was a butterfly but the process was wormy [Applause] i love him this morning i love how he does process [Music] david phil lost child bathsheba everything else babashiva produced solomon he gonna build a temple god had lived with david and his sin and whatnot but you think god just seen david alone god is the one who said david david you're too bloody love you but for bill that building double bill if you start to build that you'll be fighting all the time i want a man with peace i want a man with wisdom i want a man how to put the word together and cut the stones i want i want a man that could harmonize and connect with to get all the material to put that building together and you don't have the disposition and type to do it so take your son go on go on to be with your fathers oh i love him this morning you didn't go to them the ways go say next we moping moping moping moping like samuel like sammy i'm going to rebuke samuel samuel hello [Music] one of jesse's son samuel don't know who it is but god in the book god no [Music] samuel don't know but god knows season change soul off beat soft it's all off the word so god going and shift the anointing of kingship upon david who not ready yet to sit on the throne but you have to shift it before before you come into power you have to put your noise did you hear that yeah yeah before you come into a position and power you have to put the anointing upon you of royalty of kingship of sanji herb of inheritance of power are you riding with me this morning are you in the word this morning [Applause] david unlikely man likely person among the brothers brothers educated some brothers are degrees somebody's really scottish on different things the objective love every stuff here comes all soul thinking is a straightforward thing now full sponsor rather samuel the street for thing first one there is he watching listen don't look at him see time mashing shoes and everything else any time matching and shooting don't look at that you know because i don't look the way man does look so you have to get my eyes [Applause] [Music] that's the problem today people don't have the eyes of god because god has always used the unusual isn't that right and here comes samuel after all them parried before him in a prayer line and he couldn't annoy none of them he said is there anybody else see god can't fail he can't lie he'd find you you know after he passed all the pentacles and baptists he said who in central who in central who went central who in the north who in the north i can't find or hold you that's your is i knew that's how we found you you can't miss it so when when when when all influence passed through someone said you know what i'm going home maybe i make a mistake no you say is there anybody else yeah yeah david but he's still wrongly with the sheep he says send for david god god can't lie he'll go to me anoint somebody you have to have a witness so god can't lie he's in a prophet to anoint a bride a bride is here in trinidad so i never i mean make up our people so are you part of that right therefore god have to anoint you then you come here for the anointing everybody's supposed to be saying amen with that notice i ain't talk about your faults your feelings your sin your mistakes i didn't talk about that i am not talking about that that is a different chapter this is a chapter we're dealing with the chapter we deal with is bride anointing calling justification election predestination and those that he had perfected forever when david come forward there no cologne no under arm smelling just like the sheep he's seen a boat go samuel take the whole corn honer oil and pour it on his [Applause] head for david david don't know what to say brethren stunned david say well um i hear she bleeding excuse me david just walked and gone anointed he don't even fully know what that is all about the bible said the same day the same time he was anointed an evil spirit came upon [Music] [Applause] now watch process what's possessed to bring prophecy to come to pass watch process david is not only gifted to see what sheep he's gifted in music and in those days music the suit and get them devils running amen so when i even spirit everybody know that he was put upon soul you know it's not they don't know i didn't they say you know what you need some music you need the right tone not that rock thing another heavy metal german thing not that that would just bring more devils you need the right kind of music and we know somebody who can play the right kind of music send for david david don't know fully yet that is his court it is true that is his kingdom david comedy as a psalmist as a hard player and when he plays up evil spirit leave david walking through everybody know david he's a nice guy eventually god making process happen now go light come david defeat goliath and after that this is a singer special soul killer chosen david killed ten thousand that was not the special to sing after that special is when saul said they got a real fight with david he recognized david not right here david is already anointed saul knows that david is anointed he don't know what david commission is no no they don't know what david commission is but what they know is that david is anointed this purpose they don't know yet hallelujah what god ordained for him they don't know yet wanting all of them no he's anointed oh he was anointed because samuel horner come on now come on now brother you've got to be anointed to go forward to go further yes yes yes god is anointing people in here right now [Applause] oh glory to god you have victory over them devils right in your house or give the lord a shout you're gonna overcome power gonna come upon you yes the river ah oh jesus oh glory hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh receive your blessing receiving the holy ghost receive the power of god upon your life receive that anointing this morning god want to anoint you leave you with power this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen this message is a true message it's a genuine message it is real god sent a real prophet oh hallelujah remember when samuel was walking down to the village what are the elders i'm saying comments the whole piece to play because when a prophet comes on a scene is judgment it's a word from the lord men the trumpet when a prophet come but they don't come in with permission and and they have to go and take her back before they speak you know however they are they come you know long beard rugged looking stick oh looking but once they come down they're balling dust here they'll you better shake and trembling because god is with those men the only answerable to god no king no potential only god now the prophet said the church is no longer the voice of god so god going to turn against her he said there's another people in the land under the messenger which will only have one you only have one messenger not two one three and four everybody want to be their own private messenger but that i know what the prophet said under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age he said once more the world will get direct from god that's not on books and tapes [Applause] that is not books and tapes hallelujah once more the world will hear direct from god because the voice of god will be in her bride not some man speaking it's going to be god speaking the voice of the archangel will be in a pride seven living voices all glory to god hallelujah hallelujah there is going to be a manifestation of seven living voices that's the thunder they're gonna shake the devil oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen [Applause] listen listen the law couldn't make anyone perfect perfection without a revelation is legalism that is what it has rampant especially in trinidad legalism trying to legislate righteousness or legislate perfection you can't do it it has failed it has to come by christ through christ by the blood through the blood that is what it's all about oh man because if what we do could make us perfect christ didn't have to die or give the lord a shout in the house did you get that it's very long dress and wearing tie and wear your hair long could make you perfect what what was the problem guys dying just wear long dress wear long tie wear long hair and you're good to go [Music] my sister came up to me she said i want to show you her coat she generally quoted her she said i said i know it she said you know that i said yes she said nah i don't know now she's a bullhead she's disrespectful and i know it but she's trying to check my spirit to see if what she's seeing what she's seen in me what if i've seen it too so she could judge me by what she read in a book because she find this in a church and that nature at that time she didn't say you know church like a backseat i said i said the jewish i say better check yourself you must be back to it the world changed accident now that is that is how bad it comes where people could judge you can't judge a church by an individual that's crazy you can't judge somebody if there's somebody come and say they find this one find out you're the only person the visitor you're the only person baptized the only person is a real believer you don't need to put no coming back you don't even know and you're judging she's supposed to look so who's supposed to look when god called you how you were looking you was recognized when god called you was smelling nice he was recognized he wasn't born in sin he was born somewhere else he was born in the hospital well brethren whether you're born in hospital or in a bed in a mother house you were still born in sin leading the blood of jesus [Applause] so ika god knows i have a problem with men men men playing god men men playing god and people shaken under fear because they fear the man if you come against a man just go strike you that will strike you that will strike you all that's striking is fear not fear god you know and the preachers come and be praying pulpit they want to put the fear of god in the heart of the people and what end up happening is you fear the man in the heart of the people not the fear of god if you have man because we have to work with love let me continue friends there are so many things we could say tonight about the perfection we are always trying to gauge all the eyes of somebody else to make ourselves just a little holier than they are but if we only look at the picture it is only god's grace that we are what we are so nobody should come in here and feel uncomfortable no one should come here and feel like somebody looking down at them just look up at them if they look down at you look up at them i say what you playing anybody playing that up there will tell them the steps to come down come for you you have to come down and walk with all the rest of us out of the building you can't stay up there and float up there in some and that's the whole point everybody would want to be one up i'm ahead of you i am better than you i am more than you what is it god requires perfection he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him he's looking tonight no matter how much you have sinned no matter how much how little or how much you are still a sinner i seen this small and my brother here next door he's still in big sur so you have seen measurement now one half a centimeter sin i want to have two feet and that is another corner she had three feet a sin i don't talk about the brother behind here four feet and the other one you kind of count the other common yards and miles but big sin and small sin in god's sight the same sin could we give the lord a praise so big sin needs blood and small sin needs blood because god is perfect that's what the blood came for to bring that perfection so no matter how much your sin how little how much you're still a sinner and cannot get in no other way but by jesus christ god all sufficient sacrifice and in him you're perfected forever think of it it's nothing you do it's not new pages you turn it's not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and god's grace to you that brings you to perfection and then you are perfected in christ jesus wow it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection you have to be perfect to get there the bible said so it's a perfect kingdom it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to the perfect son of god and you must be a perfect bride amen so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god the waters of separation that watches us from sins the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word i love that description the bloody wood when you leave here this morning you must feel that dripping bloody wood upon your life you're not supposed to leave it with condemnation you're supposed to leave here even with a possibility of being restored being made whole be my will i can't solve every problem i'm not a psychologist or psychiatrist but god knows your problem god knows your situation and god love and care enough for you that that his spirit can withdraw you to come here this morning that you could be edified and blessed that you could be helped and you could be strengthened oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord do you believe that oh glory to god thank you lord so therefore we are perfected absolutely spotless and blameless not one sin on us are you above temptation never do you sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him and god could no more judge us than nothing he already judged us in him when he judge christ he judged me he judge you he can't judge me again [Applause] that's the revelation that's the revelation that's the revelation that's the revelation christ was judged we were in him we have already been judged therefore this morning you are free hallelujah hallelujah denver i wish i had the voice of your angel to bring you to a place where you could see it you have to see it then you are free oh glory to god woman go and sing no more who the son of man set free is free indeed glory you may be seated this has been a tough one to really get through last week struggling i have 16 pages i don't want page three so you know i ain't get very far but brannon the god of this world is on satan eden the god of this world today the worship person of this world today is satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping satan it's satan impersonating himself as the church no this is deep this is not skim milk this is not the developer there were no two horn and red with a big fork we could see that one because that is him but this one here is one we want to focus on it is satan impersonating himself as the church they worship satan thinking that they are worshiping god through the church aha so now it come back now to what it really is so then they love their church they love what they see they love their dreams they love what they feel they love their emotions they don't love the word when they would come because the word checks them the word always come to check you that's what they would come to check me i'm not saying this to you you know i'm hearing it just like you do you know some of the things i'm hearing for the first time you know some of the things that jamming just the same you know but i've got to speak it i still have to say it i can't hold back because i've got to speak it still [Applause] watch they worship satan thinking they are worshiping god through the church but it's the way sitting down and the way you say wait a minute we preached a word look back here at my text tonight satan was the one that preached the word to eve first he said god had said it was a misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day he would let you know all jesus did was perfectly well he will let you know what all moses they were perfectly well when you take the promises that they give for this day then that was applied to another age people ignorantly worshipping satan thinking they are worshipping god as we are warned by prophecy and this is on paul and first thessalonians we beseech you brethren by the coming of the lord jesus and by the guardian they get of him the coming of the lord garden of him that yet you be not soon shaking or troubling spirit on your mind let no man receive you by any means for that day shall not come except the come are falling away first we're not talking about backsliding falling away now we're talking about a following from god and far away from the word are following from the promises are following from prophetic utterance are falling from that yes until the management be revealed he said now this deceitfulness of the church today the son of perdition now people worshipping satan in his this day thinking the worshiping god now let's let him tell us what that is they are worshiping him to a creed we believe this did he prophesy that no you can't find it but it revealed it's a hidden mystery well hide it from me please keep that one hidden watch their worship and through a creed are man-made denominations and queens that brought the people right down to the greatest deception that the world has ever known no matter how much the word of god promised for this day is preached and vindicated they still won't believe it you own this people we believe in signification and you're taking your own you just quit this and quit that unless christ opened the door and quickly to your heart and you come to a place where sin is dead and his eyes all gone it's self-righteousness so the next bottom right here the only close button right here they dress down to their ankle and they're holding these people and they don't press the hair and they don't wear makeup and they don't wear earrings they don't when they're doing that but that is the only self-righteousness until christ comes into your heart doesn't matter if you wear camel skin and you come out of the wilderness and you have beard for days christ is still in your life that's john about this hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah are you with me how can we be perfect true death of christ is not church joining oh blessed be the name of the lord so when the new word come in you are changed you don't have to do anything to prove it your life proves it as you walk you will love peace long suffering gentleness meekness patience that's what you are and the whole world sees the reflection of christ in you but abraham i've seen visions sick healed dead rays when they were laying out there doctors walk away they are finished and go on lady a couple of hours and which will come back and show a vision go down there and raise that person up death dumb blind crippled walk that is not it that's just attributes oh hallelujah paul said we'll do all this but lay all that aside now let's go into perfection the church cannot be perfected through organizations it's get further away from god all the time or further away from each other we draw barriers we separate ourselves seemingly not having a faith and then we leave those principles of the doctrine if we move on to perfection then those little things become of nothing much use all right you see a cling tongue saw reduction doctrine doctrine but when you start to go to perfection them sword play account dealing with the bull is what counts dealing with the maniac man is what counts dealing with the bees is what comes and doctrine can't cut down the bull doctrine casting back the bees it will take perfection to do that [Applause] hallelujah so love came over him and then he tell the bull stop he loves and the bees love dealt with this love what is that that is perfection [Music] but this is deep he said we go into a relationship and we find out the only way that we can be perfected is to be in christ we find out then by the teachings of the bible that's not how we get into christ not by water baptism not by leaning on hands not by teaching not by teaching but by one spirit we are baptized into one body and become perfected through a suffering then we look different we think different we act different we live different not because it's a duty or we belong to church but because the love of god is shed abroad [Music] [Applause] in your heart the love of god strike your heart charity bear it all things saw you so hasty you need charity amen got it exposing your haziness to say you're here he's easy no can i show you your need because charity suffered long and is kind it doesn't puff itself up it's not easily provoked and believe it all things that hope it all thinks it enjoyed all things charity never feel it [Music] all right could we take a little more they gotta take a little more because i'm not finished yet until more is a holiday caught here caught here caught you red-handed you thought you was going to escape. all right okay here we go now god was this great spirit we pictured him a circle curvature of the earth but god is eternal he was the perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect joy perfect satisfaction here we go are you ready all those seven spirits as we get into revelations they come out and made up of god god was perfection everything else outside of that has been something perverted from that amen now the only way we can come back to perfection is to come

lord let me take his now because that's the purpose he died for how many will pledge the same thing i know you raise your hands but i want to read it again for you to know what you're pledging to he said i pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace i pray i will seek daily without ceasing until i feel every one of these requirements flowing that's the whole difference flowing in this statute of minds till i become a manifestation of the living christ for he became sin like me that i may become russians of god like him he took my place lord let me take

can't stop know how to finish this here now hallelujah so jesus he the spirit of god dwelt in the fullness of jesus christ jesus was the word and the words was invisible now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh then the word becomes visible so when you begin to see visible evidence and manifestation of god in our midst it would mean that the word is becoming flesh because as the word becomes flesh the invisible becomes visible you're gonna see god you're going to see god let me prophesy you will see god you will see the invisible become visible right in front of your eyes hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god oh hallelujah so this invisible god is the word amen [Music] ministry of the word but the visible going to be the ministry of the spirit from the guide around the holy spirit watch remember faith and virtue now remember the holy spirit cannot cap the building of god until these things are operated by the spirit he didn't say by revelation he didn't say by intellect he said the virtues you have to begin to operate by the spirit when that begins upon your spirit is subconscious behavior is nazis are coming to oh gosh a nice smile god bless your sister no that's you operating it doesn't operate by the spirit upon the spirit means it's thundering it's flowing it's living through you you can't even help it no i didn't read the story when bahrain said we're all trying to gorge somebody's eyes but he had an experience he went to a restaurant and there was a woman there in the middle age short pants on talking with some man music playing and he said god is this a place that you're going to raise up my children to be in why don't you condemn this place he felt a tap on his shoulder god pulled him to the side broke a vision upon him he saw himself as a child all the sins he doing and whatnot his sins come up to god he saw the blood of jesus as a bumper pushing it off he saw a book with all his sins in it and god mark pardon potency of forgetfulness and then go tell him i forgive you and you condemn her no i know preachers don't preach about that dinner because so much condemnation going on they they don't want to hear about that god told him i you condemn my life i forgive you god nothing more again nothing more nothing more that's testification let's see what he's going to do now so he comes to the woman i said woman listen listen listen i was just condemning you and i was saying this and saying that god show me this you want to break on tears she said i was a christian and this happened that happened on a backslidden and whatnot and right there on the floor they kneeled down in the floor in the restaurant and that one was restored back right there on the floor because the man gets a revelation that the blood is not only for him come on now come on now some people might walk inside that i want to see the woman carrying on so you walk back out not me and that banner not me on that restaurant but the experience changed brother madam's perspective to see through the eyes of god god don't see as man sees that's the problem today i don't have it here but but abandon said how would god take these unlimited fishermen to put them in ministries for the perfecting of the saints why would god bypass the theological exploits in the book of moses in the form of pharisees and sadducees who already know the word them listening to tapes since they're youth them reading scriptures from sunday babes these sins are the talk they need lineage of scriptures so it would have been sensible to get these educated scripture taught people to take on the ministry but god don't think the way man thinks god went first find people who was never in no scriptures peter was just i mean i know smoking grass whether it is smoking and drinking or whatever it is peter was just a fisherman and god said i come to call you to fish for men not not them fishermen thing different kind of fish come come come i'll make you a fisher of men come follow me james follow me philip follow me ordinary man that's collected too nobody loves exactly collector nobody likes caesar to come and contact from them but jesus make sure he picked that one too come come come come follow me too he set it up so so that they have the friends who they like to be following jesus jesus do you pick him if jesus said peter pick pick 12. peter pick family relatives friends all parents partners everybody i follow you jesus jesus and let peter pick him that's why he let them ministers do not pick him no convention do not picking they know brotherless and brother that apostles and personality prophets and prophet had no dominion picking he will do the choosing [Music] look look look look look look holy ghost fell man upper room holy ghost fell upon them staggering what not the first thing they had to do was to pick a man on the church vote for my tires god didn't vote for him go ahead nobody think he coming through you know because he is all yeah he's the church he's riding shotgun he coming against the christians all of a sudden many books say time to call him try to call him up god just do so on the early phone pill on fire hit him so right there with his son and said who are the lord that the whole son is a stalk all the time you think he's a pharisee actually pharisee and he's this and he is that he have always positioned it all them things only in the human spirit you know when god blew that out all them believers bang all our different churches when the holy spirit began to fall it blew all them into petition orders only floating around them that's not them they are the word that's why you don't have to know the mechanics you just have to know the dynamics when that last crop come in they are coming and say oh this book should really read it really i read this one every day read it's time to leave [Applause] [Music] understand this granny grandpa he all fallen down almost halfway to the grave moses come around and when moses come out everybody going you know they carry grandpa to another put him in a cat gotta put him in a ox cart wherever his grandpa go into you know all manjar going to you know that's what we're talking about oh hallelujah now the young child who now come up he's excited he can run down almost don't take down to the lamb he's going to everybody going to because one call so that final call like i said my books are read where you're going yeah we no books you stay there with that you stay but you read no books when will you say let us go somebody just said he called they're working behind some band for so long things have no message come and plagues fall don't you hear me going we going hey master gone hallelujah where are you going i don't know i go with the rest some of them didn't know where they're going all they know they go in they're going out they're going off from pharaoh they're gonna from that slavery they're gonna from sin they couldn't find their failures and the shortcoming they're going out you can't stay where you are tell yourself you're going out god want them out he said tell pharaoh i let my people go let them come to mind among them to worship me yes yes they want to come out of worship do you want to come out of worship do you want to come out to center worship oh hallelujah praise god praise god just one morning close hallelujah so these things have to be operated by the spirit oh my these virtues has to be in there before the captain will even come on it until these things are here we go scripturally proven and sealing to you then you're son and daughter of god i'll close with this this is what page now page 9. i believe that the church is coming to that perfection [Music] that the ministry of perfection where the offices where the apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the perfection of the church them pastors and teachers will be so with the word with the word not with this brother well brother not with his brother no i'm not with that brother you're right i am with the word amen amen the question should be asking is is with the word i don't see him in weak conventions no you don't see many contentions but see if he is with the word these men going to be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the come of the lord i believe that amen oh my praise the name of the lord so i believe god is waiting for the sons of god who have to be powered and then sent into the place of trying until these virtues are scripturally proven into them then place them positionally as adopted sons for this great end-time ministry a great time is ahead of us a great price is ahead of us a great cost is there for us but we are coming to that perfection and he has already perfected them forever them that are sanctified oh hallelujah prove you are in this message by being sanctified the seven thunders is the blood oh hallelujah charity is the spirit the blood come to sanctify you when the church finds this probably love when the church finds his holy decency when the church finds his place in christ it the members of the body come and rejoice with us
