Luke chapter 18 9 to 40. I don't think I ever use this scripture in a prayer meeting or a prayer so as before but somehow uh it came with me Luke chapter 18 reading verse 9 to 14. and he speak this Parable unto Satan which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despise others this is Jesus speaking now two men went up into the temple to pray one of heresy and the other are publican the Pharisees student prayed us with himself gone I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this public I fast twice in the week I give tights of all that I process and the publican standing affairs would not lift up so much as his eyes under him but smoothies rest upon his breast seeing God be merciful to me Asylum I tell you this man went down to his house justify rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be a beast and he that humbles himself shall be exalted may God bless the spirit tonight I have a word five letters Pride that would call Pride I don't know how to explain it but somehow this has been right in me for the past you know two days try and goet before full and the way I begin to see it I if I guess I never saw it that way you know you see people backslide people get into all kind of issues and challenges and you want to know how that comes about but Pride truly goes before a fall and I want to look at pride in a certain way tonight trust that your help they refine and assist you in your Christian work and assist you particularly in praying in your prayer life what is pride of dictionary meaning other resources pride is a feeling of deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements the achievement of those with whom one is socially associated or from qualities or possessions that are widely admired that's Pride the prophet said pride is such a Christian so awful pride is evil and that probably going before a fall really comes from Proverbs 16 18 and 19. pride going Before Destruction and a haughty spirit before so when you see the needle of one's life and and most of the times we come from nothing we come from low estate we come from like sinner level then and God bring us and bless us and whatnot and afterwards people sometimes trip they get tip over with money with finances with buildings houses lands cars whatever and they begin to feel a sense of superiority and a haughty spirit before better it is to be of an humble spirit with a lowly than to divide the spoil with the probe well the Bible speaks here in verse 18. of a haughty Spirit what is this 40 and citizen is out it says blatantly and distinctly proud having or showing an attitude of superiority and contempt for people or things perceived to be inferior so a haughty person acts Superior look down on others 40 people are disdainful prideful obnoxious and they are unfriendly and they consider better than other people so now you're getting a closer picture of how this man could pray that we I am not like that public idea the adjective of proud produce feeling pleasure of satisfaction over something regarded as highly honorable or creditable to oneself having proceeding form or showing a high opinion of One's Own dignity importance or security Pride leads to ruin and don't fall and those who are arrogant will face God's judgment James 4 6. but he gave it more grace wherefore he said God resisted the proud but give Grace unto the humble and this scripture here struck me a certain way now here it is a person in their pride in their Holy Spirit they're praying I want to say praying they are uttering words but it's not true prayer because God actually resists the proud so I don't know Pride can't really pray that I'll see it that way approach Spirit cannot really pray Philippians 2 you could write it down if you want three and four says let nothing be done through strife and or gain Glory but in loneliness of mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also the things of others that any Amplified sale do nothing from factional motives through contentious Strife selfishness or for unworthy enemies or trumped by conceit or empty arrogance instead inner the true Spirit of humility loneliness of Mind Let each regard the other as better than and Superior to himself thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourself miss it again thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourselves Let each of you esteem and look upon and be concerned for not merely his own interests but also each of the interests of others I some things can't be preached it has to be shared and some things are more caught than taught so in Sharon you could catch something the sin of pride is a very serious thing because this is a great obstacle for prayer for your growth and pride as one right to say is a form of idolatry and I see it where one worship oneself instead of God and I call it powered by self powered by you your thoughts your ideas what you think what you feel self-powered and because pride is what it is Pride doesn't give an opportunity to be Dependable to dependent upon God and that is why this is so very important I want to repeat that Pride doesn't allow one to be dependent upon God say for instance somebody who get into some money they get sick they see they get Petty doctor they don't even want to send in a prayer requests because they feel they are in charge of themselves they have the ability to do this and do that um they don't really need God they have money they don't really need God they have power and they use it until it runs out then oh God help me pride is what does not so let's continue okay Pride manifest in many ways in self-righteousness in contempt in Rebellion Pride is what make people refuse to admit one's faults and in Ministry we haven't talked to that so many times people who when they are brought a task or when things are brought to them not me I ain't taking blame for that I take it that that's just Pride on this plane they will not say thank you a glad you put out some attention I will work on it always an excuse always something different no acceptance for what is being pointed to them of their Falls or the attitude of the behavior no they reject that and it's like a rebellion the Bible warns about judgment how God eats Pride and God opposes the proud and will give FIFA to humble but pride is like a door that leads to other sins lion cheating hatred Pride could also blind you from your own sinfulness you know I see people years ago you meet Brethren the boxing and because they really not spoken with books because there have been a message long enough I have a season I've seen my soul and my son now come back and like if they're controlling the powers that be on the outside and they don't some of them to this day 20 years 30 years is still out there all what they were talking about will just talk because no man could come in the father draw and they take quotes to keep you so Pride cause people to despise others and look down on others the cure for pride is humility true humility which is to realize how much we are dependent upon God now you could wake up in the morning don't pray starter go drive pick up your work at the Montgomery salary money buyer groceries eat live have your friends no you can come to church from the church when you want anytime you want you know you have to know what's going on you come and you do that religious activity and you can live so month after month year after year three years but when you're stripped at some point in time if you are in Pride mood you have a visitation coming I'm gonna read it from the scriptures you have a presentation coming those who are in Pride mode they have a visit coming God will visit you so this is an opportunity to rethink look in a mirror and examine your heart humility put us in a position to receive Grace to receive God's love but where did Pride come from another thing we know but I feel led to do this tonight I believe in my heart this is going to help someone there where did Pride come from Isaiah 14 tells us verse 12. and God was addressing Lucifer how adult fallen from Heaven Lucy for Son of the morning or without cut down to the ground which just weakened the Nations so that was said in thine heart what did I know I will ascended to Heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the monk of the congregation and the size of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet though shall be brought down to Hell to the size of the pit they that CD shall not only look upon me and considerly saying is this the man that made it to tremble and did she kingdoms that make the world as the Wilderness and destroy the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners there are churches that feel that they're better than the others they're treated the field they're on top and we rest below are working on nonsense and pastors put that evil spirit upon the people I go to the evil and the people walk in Pride they walk in Pride of the church that they end of the pastor that they have of the system that they have and God has nothing to do with this and when you consider the scripture we read about this Pharisee and Scribe because Jesus the Bible says he humbled himself from the King obedient I have no reputation but he humbled himself and became obedient so in other words in order to become obedient you have to humble yourself I have seen Brethren that have been blessed others watch them they want the bless them but they don't want to follow in obedience they believe that in their own mind they can accomplish and get the blessing the blessing that others got by obedience and to get into that place of opinion you have to find your place of humility and humbling and humility and humbling and having a humble mind is something you could do something you could exercise something you you make an effort or effort humility humbling being respectful good morning good evening God bless you how are you and you know it doesn't cost to be nice it doesn't cost to be kind it doesn't cost to give a good word it doesn't cost a smile and there are people who don't do those things just to be or they said clear to us uh full of virtue full of character full of grace just to be like that and this to me is how God wants us to be so I want to challenge you tonight if you're not like that say God have mercy do like this Republican upset say God help me praise the Lord this is Buddha Brown speaking about Mary Magdalene Mary Magdalene she knew his power she knew there was something about him that was different from anyone else she had Seven Devils cast out of her everybody that ever been free from the Devil by the power of Jesus Christ knows where they are standing you no one can ever come in this great divine presence and ever be the same person anymore you are changed there is something happen to you you can stand off psychology imagine this accept this certain thing some theories and that but we believe in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ when you come into His presence there is something that happens in your life that changes you and you're never the same anymore a man that has ever been in the presence of Christ so she had seven Devil's caption of her pride and envy so he just in this particular court he identified two pride and envy and she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her but when Jesus spoke and said be thou clean all that left her question and answers is on a quotation here and she's saying this and tutors of the earth is in sin and more than that which two tools of the Angels was kicked out and those demon spirits there we go come into people and habitate their body see what I mean they are demons they once existed and they come into the people and give them a nature and Jesus cast seven out of Mary Magdalene Pride boast unclean filthy vulgarity emulation Strife all these things so he identified all these things are spirits Pride unclean filthy vulgarity emulations Strife all these things them were spirits that was made back up back there when God began to make man off of there in his own image created those subration being those spirits so Pride this closet this secret closet despacito closet where the Lord said I'll meet you in dear or when you pray pray to your father who's eating secret Pride doesn't feel any need to go inside idea because privacy I'm fine I'm okay I don't need that pride is is busy pray have its plans its Ambitions Pride have it's it's uh what is that it has achieved so there's no need to pray and ask God and depend upon God for every inch of the way you want God to be dead no Pride don't need to do that pride is self-satisfied but if you have to get a virtual Pride us to die prayers today Proverbs six team we read it these six things that the Lord hate ye seven abominational to him proud look a lying tone hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devised Wicked imagination feet that are Swift to run into mischief a false witness that speaketh lies are needed so at Discord among brethren in the amplifier that first thing that was identified out of the seven proud look the spirit that makes one overestimate himself an unestimate others it goes together so it's not a matter of the person just proud overestimated themselves they underestimate others so when the man was talking about oh he is so righteous and he's not like the adulterers and not like the foreign see that is what that is about okay Proverbs 16 5. reads everyone that is proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished the Amplified everyone proud and arrogant in heart is disgusting hateful and exceedingly offensive to the Lord be assured and I pledge it they will not go unpunity Jeremiah 9 23-24 this this one's is very very interesting Jeremiah 9 2-24 thus fear the lord so this is the Lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the Mighty Man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that Glory it glory in this that he understand it and knew at me and that I am the Lord which exercise love and kindness judgment and righteousness in the Earth for in these things I Delight see at the law the Lord let not the wise and skillful person glory and boast in his wisdom and skill let not the mighty and powerful person glory and boast and his strength and power let not the person who is Rich in physical gratification and will be wealth glory and boost in his listen temporal satisfaction and let's be riches but let him who glories glory and this that he understands and knows me personally and practically directly Discerning and recognizing my character that I am the Lord who practices love and kindness judgment and righteousness in the Earth for in these things I Delight says the Lord so you have to understand that wherever somebody is whether they're in power whether it enriches whether in government whether whether it's a king or prime minister or whatever Minister doesn't matter is God who allow them to be in that position so they can't and he said don't do it don't glory and here is a man has returned to Daniel 4. we want to look at a man whose heart was lifted up Daniel 4 28 is his name is Nebuchadnezzar verse 20 said all this Came Upon Kingdom Nebuchadnezzar at the end of 12 months the bill is big Palace and everything else at the end of 12 months he walked in the Palace of the kingdom of Babylon the king speak and said it's not discreet Babylon that I have built for the house of the Kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my Majesty look at the arrogance look at the pride look at the confidence you manage walking in this Palace and he is giving glory to himself the king speak and said this city is not discreet Babylon that I have built for the house of the Kingdom by the might of my power and for the glory of my Majesty verse 31 listen to this now while the word was in the king's mouth their fellow voice and they haven't seen O King Nebuchadnezzar today it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee verse 32 and these shall Drive thee from Men and I dwell in shall be with the Beast of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until you know that the most high Roulette in the Kingdom of men and give it it to whomever he will the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar he was driven from Men and did it grass as oxen his body was wet with the Jew of Heaven till his ears were groomed like eagles feathers and his knees like buried clothes and at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto him and my understanding returned unto me and I bless the Moose High and I praise and honored him that liveth forever whose Dominion is an everlasting Dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation and all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing and he do it according to his will and the army of Heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say to him what was thou at the same time my reasons return unto me and for the glory of my kingdom my honor and brightness return unto me and my counselors and my Lord sought unto me and I will establishing my kingdom an excellent Majesty was added unto me an external and honor the king of Heaven all whose books are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in Pride he is able to abuse or get the Lawson Praises tonight all this King fell from that high level and God stripped him and when he got finished with him and his mind came back he gave glory to God and he acknowledged that this is the king that is the real boss isn't that something tonight blessed be the name of the Lord so I trust the Lord will help you as you look you know earlier I want to talk about a visitation to the proud and I get that from Reading Jeremiah 50. 29-32 it says call together the actors against Babylon all leader then the bull Camp against it wrong about let none of beer will escape recompense according to a work according to all she had done do unto her for she had been proud against the Lord against the Holy One of Israel therefore shall our young men fall in the streets and all the men of War shall be cut off in that day saith Lord behold I am against thee who thou most proud said the Lord God of hosts for thy day is come the time that I will visit thee and the most proud shall stumble and fall and None Shall raise them up I will Kindle of fine cities and it shall evolve all around the broken so friends Pride will get a visitation of this season of judgment humility keeps in eyes on God blessed in the point spirit is that what Jesus said loneliness meekness so this parable of the Pharisee and the publican it's a parable of humility and pride the Pharisee was caught up and seen his own self-righteous Deeds that's why he could identify adultery and Sinners and identify all these things like that he could list his virtues he went to service he pays tithes he did this he did that he had a list of things he could identify as that he could take off and this poor publican just to the far off couldn't raise his head but he went away Justified Maybe that poor Publican didn't even make it inside the church maybe he was hearing the sermon from outside maybe that Pharisee of course he is regular and everything else but his heart is not right pride is prison Traders reason the times and same time you're Jesus what pride is doing and he left unjustified condemned and rejected by God Republicans saw no good thing in himself Republican was just saying Lord have mercy upon me he was donkas God be merciful to me a sin he wasn't saying that to be humble he was saying that because it was truth that is what humility does humility acknowledges truth and Jesus he wanted to clearly bring this Parable to show this story I know we say parables are stories that have mysteries in it hidden things in them and Jesus said I tell you that this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other and it's amazing that God is attracted to Humble Hearts God is attracted to humanity sometimes people pour and they get blessed and they get overwhelmed I have seated my own self in Ministry somebody get promoted Before Time and it reacts them and you'll hear it on jobs they are nice workers they're working but they have to get the character to go to the next step because if they're placed in a position of power they abuse that power they misuse the power and screw up the whole thing so pride and fix our prayers God is close to a humble heart scripture for that Isaiah 57 15. for God say it the high and lofty one that inhabited eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place but who but who with him also that is of a contrite on humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contract ones what kind of heart do you have tonight Pride Bible said I think they're coming to God must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that presently seek it I believe Jesus pleased this problem as a powerful teaching on humility because I believe humility was part of Christ character it was a big feat of his character in so much that you couldn't could hardly distinguish him from the rest of the disciples I think was Judas had what they say the one that I kissed that's him he just blend in with the rest the Bible says he had no form no complaints that we should design there was nothing that made him stand out because humility doesn't try to stand out even though he doesn't try to be recognized humility not looking for attention so it was important that this parable of this two men went to pray and and how it unfolded because that Pharisee he he's supposed to know to pray he in this thing long time in Bible studies he's been trained he's not Pharisee and we call a Pharisees just half-heartedly he's labeled that because he come to stuff to qualify him to be that but watch something prayers are not uttering words we could utter words but that is not praying we're saying things to God but that is not praying we could be wasting time the Bible said in vain do they worship me teachings and doctrines the Commandments of men so words could be like almost like Creed and death like out of that promotion life or death words not talking to me no you're talking about talking to God I don't want you to wasting time so if we say let's pray and you dear and your pride and your arrogance and your attitude and you've seen in mumbling mumbling that words that you're mumbling going nowhere is still in your drawing room kitchen bedroom wherever you are hearing it tonight it's saying right there it's you and your own words those words that that Pharisee article God that went nowhere it didn't have no change in them it didn't really upon him it could even justify him he was inside the Tabernacle and that Pharisee was public and was outside and Jesus himself said the man on the outside went away just in life and here have no shake you have no specials you didn't have no you get whatever but he pronounced by God justify and the other one says remember me the other one says a lord he rebuke his other man he says we did we stop not this man and he said to Jesus said Lord remember me and those words Jesus response was today you shall be with me in Paradise man never went one to two to one church service never held the Bible never get back in Jesus name or never press play and listen to some tape he just said the right thing he had a heart to know you know what really feel this but not this year it's not something praise be that Jesus or give the Lord some praises to mine you know the Publican must have been conscious of his own sins conscious of his own failures are you conscious of your own arrogance wise with bad attitude towards your husband and they're not even conscious enough to repent of your behaving attitude you think you are not watching that husband love your wife you didn't record and watching that we're talking about God we're not talking about being in church and and going through a message or or joining an adoption or teaching you know what I'm talking something so beautiful and he said I want to point out something to you not on a point of Doctrine and he's talking about Jesus being invited by Simon and there was no foot watching flunky to watch Jesus feet and he sat there and Simon have all his rich friends all around and so on but they make Jesus something like a spectacle is he dirty and this prostitute woman come and begin to cry and and wash his feet and everything else and they're watching on Jesus saying you're talking is nothing and then mumbling grumbling among themselves if you only know what kind of one that is this that that and after a while she said Simon have a word for you I'm saying come in here you serve me terribly was terrible this woman whose sins are many no forgiven now watch Simon have sins but this woman a sins are forgiven she is doing order a service she's crying she's repentant she's getting it right oh my God and this have nothing to do with doctrines Mysteries histories and Revelations this have nothing to do with that this he says was a point in time in Jesus light this is present tense this is real this is not teaching anything this is something unfolding I'm showing you the contrast of when people have wrong objectives wrong motives and they have it all to get you because that's what they're trying to do here try this get it sign a fault and just stick your finger find a fault and point all this and point all that and God allow that woman to come to confirm this man is truly the Messiah is not something else praise the name of the Lord so humility comes from having a real low estimation of yourself Pharisees breed but there was no humility in his plan the Publican prayed and he prayed in humility humility is because we know we are little that we could pray that way we know we unworthy we could feel and we could know and then we could approach God ah about the rapper what about this last day Prophecy in the church the last day prophecy concerning this perilous time shall come for men shall be and this from this point here is church people lovers of their own selves church folks Covetous Church Foods boosters church folks proud Jewish folks blasphemers still in church disobedient to parents still going to church on thankful Unholy still going to church without natural affection they still heading to church true Springers false accusers incontinence fears despises of those that are God traitors heavy high-minded still you want to church lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God and how we look good to go to church with faith having a form of godliness for denying the power thereof all right so we come to the very end now are we going to pray out first Peter fight we don't have verse 5. and Peter's saying likewise he younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yea all of you be subject one to another and the clues flows it with humility for God resisted the proud and give it Grace and humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him so he cared for you let's read that in the Amplified it says likewise you who are younger and of lesser rank be subject to the elders the ministers and spiritual Guides of the church given them due respect and yielding to their counsel I want to stop right on that one and yielding to the country I have talked to many a young one and they don't want to listen they don't want any Council they don't even want to talk they're going through stuff and they say nothing so why do you think there's a Ministry in the church is our parents tell each other don't tell don't tell Brotherhood don't tell the ministry don't tell you don't tell and they're tearing a building on the way to hell but don't tell don't tell but you see that parent or parents they don't care what they care is the control that they have over their children right the manipulative control someone in this helicopter parents over and over over and over they're married and they're still over nobody still they still over the sun they're still over their daughter over it not giving their own chance to develop and grow I know I always preach this sometimes I talk it in in marriage or services and so on that the job of parenting is to bring the child to maturity for this course shall a man leave his father's mother 50 is white you know sometimes you hear me talk about all I want is jehoma Mothers should be in a position to teach their daughters and bring their daughters in a position that they could cook wash and handle a home down the road but some mothers or father help God have mercy what there isn't you have to know what the reason in your own house and if you don't know how you ask God because none of us born with the gift of child reason or or being an excellent father or great father a great mother but we have to learn along the way and if we don't know we ask let me repeat that if we don't know we have we ask for guidance we ask for leadership we ask me and we and I we went through what kind of stuff in raising our children but now we're in a position where we could tell people and give people best practice or what we think are better tools sometimes we talk about getting a toolbox I like to refer to that sometimes you do the best that you can you use the tools you have but there are other tools sometimes no modern times you go in a store and you see their fresh equipment that you never taught was even there and when you use it forget it it improves it shortens the kind of thing you have to do well in life there are spiritual tools they are marital tools they are different kind of tools that if you get it you say oh my goodness I could use it one time I was constantly a husband and wife and I said but you using a three-quarter in spanner to two and a half inch not it can't work if pushing your swim you're swinging it it's not working you have to get half inch to two and a half inch so if you don't have the right tool you're using tools you know you say trying your bag yes but it's not the right tools so let's go again be subject to the Elder Minister spiritual guys of the church given them due respect and yielding to their country clothed yourselves clothed apron yourself all of you with humility as the Garb of a servant so that is covering cannot possibly be stripped from you with freedom from Pride diverse humility is from you that you will be free from pride and arrogance towards one another for God sets himself against the proud the insulin the overbearing the disdained the presumption the boastful and he opposes frustrates and defeats them and you ask yourself the question why are so many Christians unhappy I have seen that some of them have money and The Honorable they are whole school why Pride and God is opposing them God is frustrating them and God defeats them let me read this again so okay where do we get this from it says likewise you're younger submit yourself unto the Elder yeah all of you be subject one to another be clothed with your reality for God resisted to proud and give it grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he cared for you and that is where this comes from any Amplified likewise you who are younger of lesser rank be subject to the elders the ministers and spiritual Guides of the church giving them due respect and he yielding to their counsel in other words you have your own thoughts you have your own ideas let me share this with you tonight there are many times people might come in the office or who might speak to me and they have a problem or situation and honestly I don't have a clue what to say to them but while they are speaking something drops and then I speak and then I will know is not my thoughts that was presented to them when they walk out of the office they have a choice to yield ticket or ignore it some you some ignore those who who yield the council they see the fruit of it those who ignore it they see the fruit of the decision of ignore because when we make our decisions there are consequences seen and unseen known and unknown they are secondary consequences before you make decisions consider and we what are the consequences of resizations many times you hear about Isaac striking it a lot could have managed Sodom not his wife not his children not all his children so even though he cannot manage being in Sodom as a mayor or whatever they get not his family he lost his family by the decision that he made be careful so what God sets himself against the proud repeated I know the insolent the overbearing the disdainful the presumptuous the boost for and he opposes frustrates and defeat them but gives Grace fever and blessing to the humble therefore therefore therefore humble yourselves how do we go demote lure yourselves in your own estimation under the mighty hand of God that in due time he may exalt you casting the whole of your care all your anxieties all of your worries all your concerns once and for all on him for he cares for you affectionately and cares about you watch for me maybe give the Lord some praise this tonight and Thanksgiving God bless you I trust tonight this was helpful to you yeah and I I'm amazed at whole the spirit of God works how the needs in people's lives when it comes to the front when it's brought out holy spirit will pick it up and bring answers and solutions and my mind will be bloom my mind going to be blown and I've seen it unfolded in that way and all I can do afterwards is bless God because I know God is weakening their fears of man just think God put us in time but he operates in eternity so when David asks God about the prospering of the proud and the boastful and the wicked God say have you considered the end because David is not in the Viewpoint to see what that end will be but God see in the end from the beginning so he's seen when somebody stopped he's seen when people breaking out and they're going here and you know things will come out for them and they see men all of that comes to an end now remember once we are in time and we are everything is not going to last you may be strong no but that could not always be things working out perfectly you know will not always be you may you may be in perfect health right now and that will not always be you may be in youth your Prime of Youth but next 50 years talk to me that will not always be time and we said it sometime in some service God put on the time summer until winter spring he put Seasons under there meaning that they are time for you to be between three and five between five and ten between 10 and 15 and you have your changes and challenges he put that there just as you plant a coincidence of his time to unfold and the leaves and come back to Corn you put that in there everything is not instant it unfolds it reveals to time so with us being given as a free moral agent on the earth to make our own choices and live how we choose to live we don't have to accommodate God in our lives we don't have to yield we don't have to Humble ourselves we could continue as we are and God will leave us self-powered become like somebody grandfather who had business and whatnot and leave as much our inheritance and then pass on to the children and the grandchildren and this next Generation now they're born into West they never in it it's their grandfather labored and they benefit from that and they can do whatever they want they could blow some smoke some cooking some and whatever and they still have roommate but eventually it comes to an end their lives come to an end and right now eventually this little service we have here tonight comes to an end and we end it right now let's ball heads heavenly father I thank you for your precious people here tonight that patiently listened and of your word of your truth I don't have a dream to give I don't have my own thoughts to give me I have your word your scriptures to declare this to them that you resist the problem and give grace to the humble God may we change our push the night as well as I believe in it brought out Ohana she wanted Vengeance she wanted Deliverance she wanted a breakthrough to head back up to the other woman in the house but all of a sudden a prayer changed and when she changed her prayer everything changed when she changed a prayer she changed a prayer that you went to bless her with a man child that she will give back to you it wasn't a personal Vendetta it wasn't a pride it wasn't Vengeance it wasn't trying to head back to those who were mocking up but it was something that would declare you and bring glory to you Lord if you're blessing with a son I will give them back to you and somehow when she finished a prayer a continence was different she wasn't stressed out she had a joy she had a smile it's like something broke father you know how you said fit either coming to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder it is something when we connect to feet and no it's going to unfold the way you want it to unfold but I mean you bless the people tonight your sons your daughters the elders didn't the visitors the people who are connected here maybe for the first time God bless them may their cup run over maybe have a heart to do your will I made the other heart that will be humbling before you the great things confront us when they come to us we would make excuses and say you know that's not me and and it's my husband or my wife or not me or because somebody and that is why and that is why and that is all these Nazi excuse will be out the door and all will be a humbling father one time there was this Soldier who had leprosy hiding it for years covered it up but every night to go to the armor and a god there was a little sister who told her told him about Elijah that that he could be healed that was wanted to acknowledge the information to know it is possible then when he went to see Elijah I just said go to the River Jordan and dip seven times and God is pride affected him at first to obey he didn't want to do it he was angry he was upset he taught angels will lead upon him and This Is Us Lord we always have our own ideas or we're supposed to be what is supposed to be done who's supposed to do it and that's not how you work and he was encouraged but sir if the prophet said go and dip sometimes why would you just do it why don't you just obey it and finally he dropped his pride in dismisses arrogance and he humbled himself and did seven times and when he came out he was whole he was well the leprosy was gone father tonight I pray leprosy would leave the people's preach on the preset prayer that something strike I pray that something changed no this was right in me I didn't know why and I just thought it was to get down into it it just couldn't leave me and this is the fruit of it what could release me they come testimonies from this particular special service may come testimony of of Lies being changed and hearts being drawn closer to you in all Humanity granted father in Jesus I asked it bless the service this coming Sunday next week we're gonna have Lord ministering and there'll be no communion but we have in communion this Sunday here two Services where presence be with us in a special way may it be special father May there be a britual Lord and we commit the elders the ministers the whole church into enhance that your care that your love will extend to us that Revival fire will break out May start tonight may this be the final break different Keys was unloaded to us over the months in prayer may this be the final rock this final key this final thing to turn that will transform everything granted Father and Jesus might ask it amen amen friends God bless you don't let this River Jordan keep it from dipping don't let your pride keep you from depends certain times go on dip tonight God bless you Shalom thank you again for being here very simple
