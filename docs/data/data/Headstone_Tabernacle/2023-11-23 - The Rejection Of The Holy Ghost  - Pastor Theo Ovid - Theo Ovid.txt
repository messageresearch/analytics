was but now God bless you and thank you for being here tonight if have your Bibles I like to 1st Samuel chapter 8 we want to read verse 1 to8 Romans chapter 8 want to read from 1 to9 13 to 15 we're grateful to God to be here tonight amen amen reading uh 1st Samuel 8 verse one and it came to pass when Samuel was old he made his sons judges over Israel now the name of his firstborn was Joel and his name of the second ABIA they were judges in bipa his sons walk not as in his ways but turn aside after Luca took bribes perverted judgment then all the elders gather themselves together and came to Samuel andto Rama and said unto him behold thou are old thy Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the thing displeased Samuel when they said give us a king to judge us Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel hacken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even unto this day where they have forsaken me and serve other gods so do they also unto thee and from Romans chapter 8 reading from verse one there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do that it was weak through the flesh God sended his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do minor things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be kindly mind is death but to be spiritually minding is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you and now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he's not of his his let's go down to verse 13 for if you live after the flesh he shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of ab bondage against the fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB father let's pray father we thank you for your word and it's a joy to read your word and to hear your word and to oh God be in contact with this word Lord make this word a reality tonight to every believer here those online those who hear the message and may you speak to our hearts as we wait upon you Lord we such a needy people tonight remember us Lord God tonight and visit us with your strength power and confirm with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen and amen you may be seated praise God I feel blessed to be here tonight oh praise God Amen hallelujah it's always a privilege to me this how I see it I don't know about you but always a privilege to be in the house of God we don't have this right it's a privilege okay our title tonight the rejection of the Holy Ghost the rejection of the Holy Ghost i' have an inspiration to live after the flesh or to live after the spirit your choice it's your choice all right let's go let's get down let the tires hit the road now let's let's go brother BR there are only going to be two classes of people in the last day not 22 not 44 just two both of them is going to wear a mark the mark of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit without a shadow of doubt that's the mark of God and the mark of the beast is not Corona virus and taking vaccine all right all that foolishness that that that gone already now all right the mark of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit without a Shadow of Doubt I preached that not long ago by the Holy Spirit help and the word of God and proved it that the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption without the Holy Spirit you are not sealed but the holy spirit is God sealed and then all that was not sealed by the Holy Spirit took on the of the Beast and the mark of the beast is the mark of apostasy which is rejecting the Holy Spirit you see what I mean glory to God and then when the Year of Jubilee listen prophecy when the Year of Jubilee or the blast comes the people are receiving the holy spirit so there's a prophecy that you're going to be receiving Holy Spirit there's a prophecy that you're going to be Year of Jubilee there's a prophecy when the blast going to come out oh give the Lord a shout in the house this a finished yet is about to get started Oh Glory to God we speak it by the testimony of Jesus we speak it by the spirit of Prophecy oh give the Lord some Praises when the Year of Jubilee or that blast comes the people are receiving Holy Spirit and you deliberately willfully turn it down God has no more or not under any obligation to speak to you anymore then you'll be marked off he said the old types of the Old Testament and type shadow of the new to reject Christ and to turn him down that he knocked at your door you in danger line of being bored through the air Faith come by hearing and hearing the word of God and God will put a blind over your ears that you'll never be able to understand no more and you will do no more than criticize the gospel as long as you live and die and be lost forever Hallelujah the baptism of the Holy Spirit fell the first time since Pentecost in Russia 100 years years ago that's right that's history not Tor you know fell fell people talk about Holy Ghost Fallen it fell not no man teaching and revealing stuff you know it fell in Russia 100 years ago you will see why Russia com in their condition yes that's right that's history and they had the baptism of the Holy Spirit worked signs and wonders 100 years ago and rejected it as a nation and turn it down and when they did they have turned now to an anti- good anti-religious and become communist cold brutal hearted if you wouldn't listen to God he will give you over to a spirit that will condemn you and be turned to a reprobate mind to believe a lie and be damned by it and that is where Russia stands tonight damned in the sight of God because it failed to receive the Jubilee message of the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they has turned over to a reprobate mind they believe a lie and Damned in the sight of God oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God this messenger of Malachi 4 he promised to do it the messenger is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word a birth is to be she is to be delivered of a new birth according to Malachi 4 this is not 1906 Pentecostal birth he said Malachi 4 is to bring on a new birth Oh Glory to God we find out that the Pentecostal was in the womb so they didn't get that birth the birth have to come by the word and the word comes to the prophet so when the prophet brought the word we could be born by the word and by the spirit correctly oh give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah let's ride now now watch this in the church world today there are two systems working now listen read close I want you to see if you're going to say Amen on this there's two systems working in the church world today I'm going to get this off my shoulder and then I have it over with we all know that's the word of God and the denominational system there are two systems that work and I saying that two system work in this message in this message I I'm not talking about outside the message whatever preaching here is in the message we talking about all right let's go all right I'm going to get all right there are two systems that work and it's Jacob and so one after the spirit and one after the flesh Oh Glory to God hallelujah could we give the Lord a shout one after the spirit it means you're going after hallelujah hallelujah you're going after the spirit glory to God and one going after the flesh Oh Glory to God your choice if you want to live after the spirit or after the flesh your choice nobody have forcing you your choice all in the message Esau in the message and Jacob in the message too Esau and Jacob coming to church too Esau and Jacob saying amen one after the spirit oh give the Lord a shout in the house and one after the flesh let's go all right one after the spirit one flesh and what is it Esau and Jacob was fighting in the womb of the mother and even at the time they were born and so is the nominals and the word fighting one against the other now he said they say know these men talking about these men if they pick this up and goes out with it they can make more sense to it he didn't stop there some people stop there and make us feel like we doing stripp like if we making more sense than what the prophet say that not what you mean here we talking about write the vision and make it plain making the same vision plain because the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word no new mystery Liars out there oh glory to God hallelujah where they coming with where they bring in new mystery every mystery was revealed by that entire messenger Prophet oh give the Lord every mystery bride they have the promise to reveal no mystery oh Christ is the mystery of God revealed Oh Glory to God hallelujah all right let's go watch this now these men if they pick it up and go out with it they can make more sense to it here is to bring it to a place you would I want to lay this seed and that's all butam could have do put the seed then he come and said then hope they make it come to life and that is what we striving for here in The Headstone Tabernacle striving to hope to get these seeds to come to life I don't want to be talking talking explaining explaining I want to see sees come to life come alive the word made flesh the invisible made visible oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God watch Esau just a man of the world very religious he's all right good fellow clean moral as far as I know but he didn't know nothing about the birthright he's born that way he is shaped that way wow he's saw no Mysteries he saw no Revelation and all kind of word and teaching and explanation and whatnot but the birthright part but let's talk about Jacob now and Jacob I don't care what he is he wants that Birthright he's the spiritual one he is the spiritual one he little Trixie he little skull but he's a spiritual one them two today is in the womb of the church there's a great big system trying to be formed called the work Con churches and from the womb of the church is coming forth two children you just mark my word prophecy now the word must deliver the word bride Church who who bringing that the word the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride from Christ then them that asleep in all ages will make up that bride that come out of the word they come out of us isn't that right now watch these systems will not grow out of that he said no what they are both in the same field watered by the same water same sunlight one is the word and one is not the word and they are fighting they have been fighting since the First Reformation they're still fighting Hallelujah but say what system are you in two systems one system is after the Flesh and one system is after the spirit now watch this now Israel the church let's a few minutes let's follow her a few minutes she had birth pains at his message every under every Prophet The Prophet had the word and she had shown so much rotness and so much systematic orders in her being until this Prophet shook her off her foundation they were hated by everybody therefore when God sent a prophet the church itself went in the bir pains because of the Prophet Oh Glory to God the word of the Lord comes to a prophet watch and the churches they build so many systems around the word now is around the word they build the systems come on now it's around the word around the same message they build their systems around it around the word it's not the word it's around WR the word that why they using word they're using the the word as as like ketchup or like sauce or like pepper sauce they sprinkle their Doctrine and their Revelations with a little message thing now you know what I mean you season it with that let let people know what you know why still connected with that all right let's go watch this now they build so many system around the word until she shook off her Rock when he come she had birth pains what was it back to the word back to the life there's a prophet speaking there know the rocking is what back to the word back to the life systems doesn't have a life it's only God's word has life the systems are built around it but they do not have life the life is Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and the love of God holy spirit that is life systems are built around that but that is not that oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God Hallelujah huj the systems are built around it where but it doesn't have life it is the word that gives life all right let's go going good now watch something we know the old seed must the new seed can come out of the old seed it must rot not die but rot after his death now this is deep this is something to be taught not just die you know but rot not just die but rot when you rot you can't go back that's the same thing in a new birth we never go back we go forward when you are born again there are so many that's why we have not so many genuine new Birds it because the seed will sympathize with the word of the person but they don't here we go want to rot away from the old system that they were in that's why I had to press the light God say leave more bites you I more that mountain I leave es that mountain leave them alone leave people alone you drag them and P light they get some more bites inside of here and they get some es Shing out here and that will be problems you what I'm saying go I want to see God at the right people because I want God increase our borders increase our Coast at the right people inside of here we have enough little cucko already we have enough of that we we we we could do it less than that all right let's continue watch they don't want to rot away from the old system that were they were in they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system and claim the new birth doesn't work that way the message of the age we found that under Luther Wesley Pentecostal all the ages they still try to hold on to the old system and claim this you can't and people say don't want to admit that were off and they went off the word the pastor was off the whole church was off key and they had to rot out of that they to fire burn that oh glory to God come out at a complete system burn it Oh Glory to God put dynamite and throw everything behind you blow up the bridge behind you and go forward Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah when they talk Elijah stay here he say stay where gigal Jero betel he said no as the Lord liveth praise God I ain't staying here don't pin me down to stay nowhere I'm moving with the pillar of fire I'm moving with the cloud let's move with the cloud oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God they know the old system is dead but they just don't want to rot out of it now rot is when you're really done away with it a claim is made and they are newborn but a claim is only a begotten sign this is deep stuff here now a claim is what a begotten sign the begotten is in the womb I claim this I claim that I claim that that a born yet that's a begotten sign Oh Glory to God he said ring brings forth the new birth you got to rot away from it and just a it all the ages oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God all right let's go during these Church ages there are two Spirits working among right down through here one is denomination the other one is the Holy Ghost amen and Jesus said they were so close that we receive the very elected if it's possible these two Spirits are marking their people for future judgment so the holy spirit is marking you tonight to be sealed Oh Glory to God and the and and the devil amen power is marking people tonight to be judged but the marking is going on all the time oh go put a mark upon them that s and cry put a mark Oh Glory to God there going to be people Mark for the Rapture Mark for the resurrection oh give the Lord some Praises tonight oh glory to God let me read it again these two Spirits are marking their people for future judgment oh my hallelujah hallelujah and brother bam said this let me show you another reason why Satan hates This Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he changes is not he knows a whole lot more than do 90% of theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he's immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action we are talking about turle and and and a secret we not talking about that yet people talk about a secret not a public show I public I Mark 16 that what Jesus say hallelujah watch he said watch thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 AC is the true church that Jesus claim as his own all else is false it has to be take that in the message all else is false glory to God Mark 16 is action hey true church true church Let them fight that fight that with Mysteries fight that with all kind of Cu Revelation fight that the true church with the power of God s Mark 16 in action is the true church all else is all else is all else is oh give the Lord some Praises it has to be here we go you a finished yet now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts hey it wasn't the acts of men it was Act of the Holy Ghost working through men and the bride in this last day going to write another book of Acts if that original Branch if that vine put forth another original Branch it will bring out original Fruit oh give the Lord a shout in the house same signs same wonders same Miracles and here bomb same page oh give the Lord a shout in the house same P oh Hallelujah watch this now remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts and the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it in the message making it lukewarm no Praises making it formal people sitting down dead they kind say Amen making it lukew formal and Powerless you weapon and they have his argument oh give the Lord some Praises no worship no atmosphere no signs no Miracles no wonders no power Oh Glory to God they can't tell when last somebody hit the altar Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah no moving of the spirit oh give the Lord some Praises watch it shows the Antichrist Spirit come to the church defile it making it lukew formal powerless it exposes is Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word writing to the time is casting l a fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows here we go here we go he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works as she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits will came within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit not intellect not human not flesh and B Fighting by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will P us before her he will definitely tart it today as when Christ with to him at every effort hallelujah hallelujah Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them with what true Revelation that's why lacking lacking a true Revelation oh give the Lord a shout in the house Glory may be seated all that was not sealed took the mark of the beast all that had not the spirit of God had the mark of the beast the seed of God is the Holy Spirit the Bible said so every place in the scripture speaks of it it's the mark of God the Seal of God and all that did not Happ was the one who rejected and how did he reject it by refusing to hear it there's a big one here now they want to hear other things the Bible talk about having having itching ears keeping themselves teachers they want Holy Ghost know because Holy Ghost will change you give me the old time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near that's the reason people fear it is good enough for me it will make you stop your lying will save you when you're dying St the devil flying but it's good enough for me give me that old time religion they don't want it give me that old time religion glory glory to God all time Holy Spirit Well Jesus Took the book and sat down and he had a supreme anointing Supreme anointing is knowing what and how yeah like Jesus what happened in the upper room they wasn't saying quietly and talk about like Jesus you know they were staring like drunk men praise God glory to God had a great time Jesus like Supreme anointing knowing what and how and the posing like looking for a picture you put on Instagram my Lord watch this now why don't you come to it why don't you receive it don't set dead believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be sealed into the kingdom what is the mark of the beast to reject the Holy Ghost the borderline he come into the knowledge of the truth ahuh you mean you can come with the knowledge of the truth and be borderline yes because you cross over to receive the spirit so you're coming to the knowledge of the message the knowledge of the truth and remain borderline yes that is powerful now remember how do you get Faith hearing where was is it marked in the hand no in the head no in the ear hearing what did it do scarred over hearing no more no more of that for me I want nothing to they don't want to hear this gospel you know years ago you meet Brethren and they backd they're in fornication in adultery and they will talk this way that the name on the book and they will come back and all some of them G dead and G to hell that believe this message and all they have is just religious knowledge and these are the worst people the hardest people to talk to because they know the word they know right from wrong they know what the prophets say they know what the Bible say but they in sin but because they get set up intellectually and have an intellectual conception they say they the seed and they had this and they coming back they come back nowhere no years they outside things just go downhill and get both some and then Dead and Gone Gone straight to the destination never come back but they have been taught up here nothing really hit down here friends it have to hit down here you know this have to hit the heart some have to hit here you know for it to become a manifested reality it have to hit here you know a lot of people have the knowledge of the truth but the knowledge doesn't Empower you to go over oh give the Lord a shout to take the Holy Ghost glory to God the Bible said Mark those that sigh and cry Oh Glory to God that Mark those who sitting down in church oh God under the lining courts Mark those a s and cry hallelujah hallelujah praise God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what's the last plague that hit Egypt de what's the last plag going to strike this message death spiritual debt people dead in church pastors dead and they still preaching Oh Glory to God deacons dead Elders dead the whole church dead is like a mort dead people dead Saints they have to wait for the sleeping no more dead and alive alive and dead Walking Dead living dead people oh glory to God hit by that last plague it has make them can't praise make them can't worship make them can't live consecrated make them reject Holiness make them just walk in knowledge come to church and go back home and they're still dead as ever make them sing specials and sing songs but they're dead why they singing the dead why are they worshiping the Dead Oh Glory to God hallelujah he said in vain do they worship me Teach of a Doctrine the Commandments of men they push the prophet aside and yet this message said there is a people in the land under their messenger since when the pastor could be a messenger oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God under the messenger we're going to be the final voice to the final age the messenger is the voice that has to be echoed I don't care what Revelation that man came shut your M if you don't say the T say I don't want to hear you oh the Lord a praise in the [Applause] house it have no scripture for God to give a mystery to the man how the man give to the people have no scripture where where is that God send the prophet to some man and then the man will give it to the people he's sharing out he sharing out bread he breaking bread and rejoice that Baptist Church or something Hallelujah go send one messenger messenger come with the bread for the whole age and every man have to be under that think about it now if a man has to teach me then I don't need the Holy Ghost we don't need the spirit of truth no more because the prophet reveal truth what need is the spirit of Truth to come behind the prophet to reveal what is on the on the tapes and on the books that we can speak it back by Revelation by the anointing of the Holy Ghost so I need a man to come and teach me what but Ukraine and Russia and all kind like that they could go on internet and search and find out Hallelujah some people just get the information before me and have no time with that somebody watch

God my wife wife know to me when I come here walking like a cowboy back to me walking like I feel like R all right oh this part is serious you now this part is scary I heard our dear brother Pastor Neville made a remark on his television or Radio cast the other morning that just went over and over in my mind I just can't forget it I quoted to a friend of mine last night and that was this after the taken away of the Holy Spirit out of the Earth the formal Church religion will go right on not knowing the difference have you heard that that was astounding yeah they didn't know the holy spirit so they won't know when it is gone my God this is Aon we talking about any message they'll just be going right on just the same prophecy when the last one is sealed into the body of Christ not give him a book or tape or give him a tablet to reading message and believe not that when the last one is sealed into the body of Christ they will still be going on trying to bring converts to it because they don't know what it is and their former religions will continue to just like they were now it may not sink into you like it did to me where speaks but that was really an Aston statement they' be so far away just in religious rituals until they will not miss the holy spirit because they don't know what it is to begin with it have men who walk on to this message after 30 years preaching this message they never had the Holy Ghost they never had a revelation time unfold for they to walk out oh give the Lord a shout you hear you hear that then Baron said God have mercy on us let alone his absent I don't want to be here when he's not here I want to be gone then for there will be no blood on the mercy seat it'll be dark and Smoky and black the sanctuary will have no lawyer there to plead our case at that time you know the scriptures say the sanctuary was smoking there was no mercy in Blood and mercy is Judgment what we need in America is a changing of the Holy Spirit to take the place of some of our religious rituals Hallelujah my God then he said this later on in a bunch of little so-called Holy Rollers one night I found what I wanted Hall that money could not by in a bunch of illiterate uneducated poorly dressed people Negroes to begin with out yonder in a little old converted Saloon on the floor on the floor on the floor let it again on the floor reading I found a price a jewel when that old looked in my face and said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed was something that I wanted I didn't expect to find it among these people but they had what I needed oh give the Lord a praise oh that Holy Ghost is something oh glory to God Hallelujah the UN today they wouldn't accept what we got but that's what they need kushev all the rest of them need Christ in the baptism of the Holy Ghost it will change your disposition it will make men who they hate become others it will take greed away and Malice and strife and put love and joy and peace goodness and mercy yes in the unexpected Place sometimes is where you find what you are looking for that is from without with without money or without price oh give the Lord a praise Give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Glory thank you Jesus Hallelujah the people ask for a king they want is to be like the other nations and God told Samuel they have not rejected you they rejected me that is Samuel 1 Samuel chapter 8 Samuel 10 verse one says then Samuel took a vial of oil poured upon his head and kissed him talking about sa is it not because the Lord had anointed thee to be Captain over his inheritance praise the Lord and Samuel begin to speak to Saul and after Thou shalt come to the hill of God where is the Garrison of the Philistines it shall come to pass that when thou had come to to the city thou shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a sultry the Tabet pipe pop before them and they shall prophesy and the spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shall be turned into another man Hallelujah this is the spirit of God this is God this is Samuel the prophet proph sign over Saul what going to take place and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for God is with thee and thou shalt go down before me to gigal and behold I will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of Peace offerings seven days shall thou carry till I come to thee and show thee what Thou shalt do oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen hallelujah can we give the Lord some praises strict instructions wait seven days I will come and offer sacrifices and so on 1 Samuel 13:5 and the Philistines gather themselves together to fight with Israel 30,000 chariots 6,000 Horsemen people as the sandwiches on the seashore in multitude and they came up and pitch in mismash Eastward from Beth and when the man of Israel saw that they were in a straight for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and in tickets and in rocks and in high places and pits and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of GAD and Gilead as for Saul he was yet in gigar and all the people followed him trembling and he tarried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but Samuel came not to gigar and the people were scattered from him and Saul said bring hither a a burnt offering to me peace offering and he offered the burnt offering and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of the offering and the burnt offering behold Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and Samuel said what hast thou done and sa said because I always have a reason you know because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days of appointed and that the Philistines gather themselves together at MM therefore said I the Philistines will come down now upon me to gigal and I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered burnt offering and Samuel said to Saul thou has done foolishly thou was not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have esta thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord has sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord had commanded him to be Captain over his people because th has not kept that which the Lord had commanded the brother Brown we find out when this man saw the first thing you know he got great then stuck out his chest we built this big thing we done this when he done it when he got to a place he didn't want Samuel's advice anymore they don't want the prophetic word no more because they getting their own thing now he done it the way he wanted to do it that's what happened today the people has got to a place that they don't want to do it the way God wants to do it am amen they want to do it the way they want to do it and that is what's the matter today God wants Divine Healing among his people the big high fellow say wait a minute days of Miracles pass now what caused Saul to do that when he got to a place that L it blow my mind when I was studying this when he got to a place that he took over the leading of the people instead of letting the Holy Spirit that's it now Samuel told him said now if you go ahead and have your king and all live right and keep God's commandment and do what the Lord says and follow the spirit Saul will be able to preach us some great Mighty messages they had no right to disbelieve Samuel because Samuel always prophesied the truth to them he told them what was truth now if you just let Saul and all of you follow the leading of the spirit keep the Commandments of the Lord everything will be all right amen but B says if every preacher of all denominations would just follow the leading of the Holy Spirit instead of some Creed oration that's why I hate when I see men trying to control other men or other churches you said N I am at war with Nan spirit because God hates that he hates controlling the lady am by Spirit of man he hates that amen all right so watch the following instead of Holy Spirit watch instead of some denomination what some Bishop said somebody else said somebody else said what somebody else said has nothing to do with it I'm reading God sent the Holy Spirit and he is our guide he is our leader not jille or any place else the holy spirit is our leader the holy spirit is our guide and when they even see the Holy Spirit moving they get scared of it they don't know what it is it's it's a stranger to them because they are not taught in that line they have been taught away from the Holy Spirit they are taught just certain things that the church believes go right on like that go through life Call of Christians and one like that I said to a man long ago sir didn't the Lord ever condemn you for that smoking he said oh no he said no I said I've seen you drink myself but look preach I want to tell you my faith saves me I said but Mister let me tell you something faith without works is dead amen I said the Holy Spirit don't live like that I said you may be disappointed I said now Faith is all right but if Works don't follow faith faith is no good and when you die remember it doesn't change your spirit it only changes your Dwelling Place whatever type of spirit you got in you that's the place you will go and sin can never enter into heaven I wonder if the message will understand that he said confess M every night yes you said God forgive me for drinking forgive me for commit adultery forgive me for lying forgive me for Ste turn right back and do the same thing forgive me he said he said well that shows something hasn't changed inside am you're trying to paint the outside kind of white wash it what it needs to be done is to put the blood of Jesus Christ and washed white instead of whitewashed Amen all right let's continue now he said we find out then because Saul here we go this is deep took upon himself Samuel was a little late one day to offer the burnt offering which was the only legal for him to do Under the inspiration of God yes sir and Saul said why do we have to wait for him he went and offered himself he started Leading the People himself instead of letting God lead the people there is where he made his mistake that is where every church that ever organized made their fatal mistake sir I have took history from pre seen fathers Josephus all the early historians I've never seen one time where a church ever come into a great spiritual Revival fell and got away from it ever rose again I want to show you where it's at if they won't follow the light God will lay it right on a shelf let somebody else God able to raise up stones to rise children of Israel you want to be like the world don't be like the world we are different Servants of God are different they are born different they are new in Christ watch this part now the Christian robe is not made up of church made theology the Christian robe is made up of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen nothing less than that and a life that followed that baptism Holy Ghost makes you live right do right act right talk right live right are we in the word tonight now when Saul wouldn't wait on the Lord no more Samuel turned right away from him remember the first time not the second time but the first time that Saul took upon himself to take over the service of the Lord Samuel turned his back on him and walked away from him and the first time that the church lets their leader take over to lead the people the Holy Spirit gets right away from him he the bomb now and the very first time that you go being led by a man instead of God the holy spirit will get away from you too so first the leadership get broken at the top and then it goes down to the people did you get that yeah listen to this the first time that the church let their leaders take over to lead the people the Holy Spirit gets away from them in the message we finished yet know it'd have more things to trouble you tonight you know and the very first time that you get being led by a man instead of God the holy spirit will get from you so in other words the pastor lost the Holy Spirit and the people lost their holy spirit amen because they've been led by a man so it have to first come to the ministry the change have to come at the top yes sir not the minister gets off when the people and then the people gets off from being led of the Lord then he said let the Holy Spirit lead that's what we need is leadership and God give us a leader but we don't want to hear it and the same holy ghost that fell on the Pentecost which we all know was the birth of the new church if that same Holy Ghost don't bring the same experience to you then you got a different Holy Spirit than what was it will make you live a sacrificial life a life full of joy pleasure and the baptism of the spirit leading you into sign one Miracles and things something happened watch we find out Saul said I will do it myself I know how to do it I know about it much as Old fogy Samuel Samuel had proved that he was a servant of God he proved that the Holy Spirit was with him and I he said I'll take you to record this day have I ever spoken to you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass have I ever beg and bum money from you and all these things they said no you haven't done that but we want to have it the way we want it we find out then here we go when a man rejects the leading of the Holy Spirit you know what God did for Saul he gave him an evil spirit to lead him so the churches are still being led you know but not by the Holy Spirit am by a evil spirit quoting word and preaching word now how about that he give him an evil spirit God give him an evil spirit to lead him so when a man rejects the leading of the Holy Spirit or any person rejects the leading of the Holy Spirit you got a devil on you to lead you that's exactly Bible don't expect to have much Amen on that but this is still the word you say I can't compar with this meeting because my church what difference does that make what that's got to do with it I tell you they believe in this and we don't believe in that as long as they preaching the Bible the whole Bible and the Full Gospel Nothing But The Truth Listen to it amen as long as they led by the spirit believe in it let's go if a man is led by the spirit of God God will make himself known to that person God promised to so in doing so the Holy Spirit leads people and God takes care of it then I'd like to say some another thing that evil spirit begin to lead Saul and it led him and today when the Holy Spirit is rejected what will it do you will get an evil spirit to lead you now I know this is a tough call for people to understand and believe they will cannot believe that their minister is led by the devil but we read that last Wednesday that the enticing Spirit come among men ministers and make them say things and do things that are contrary to the word of God that's why you need the guide which is the holy ghost that came with the spirit of truth from the prophet you need to stay what and see what the prophet said Oh Glory to God it's so easy to deviate from the word hallelujah hallelujah now listen but speaks I don't want to hurt you I want to get you to get this just as it was in them days so it is today they don't want the Holy Spirit to to lead them same thing with young people sometime you give them advice you tell them you speak to them they don't want to hear it we some sometime ago talk people don't want to go to God because they don't want God to tell them no son get ready to go they don't want the ho Spirit to lead them so they get an evil spirit what takes place with an evil spirit the evil spirit wants to lead it wants to lead them then and now what they don't want they didn't want God to be their judge and people today don't want the whole Spirit to judge them that's the reason to turn on Samuel because his judgment was of God it was scriptural watch they don't want to be led by the spirit for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God they don't want led by the spirit they tur it down for ecclesiastical man what did they get a evil spirit to lead them people today don't want to be led by the Holy Spirit they don't want the Holy Spirit to judge them that's true friends they don't want the Holy Spirit to judge them no they don't want the spirit to judge them if you get the Holy Ghost and you come to me and tell me you got the Holy Ghost and living like that I can't be a judge but according to the word you missed the line somewhere we need back to get back to Holiness we need to get back to God but they reject it certainly they do now they don't want the real true gospel they don't want the real truth they don't want the holy spirit to guide them they rather have an intellectual Pastor amen now what did Saul do here what here we go now almost there he certainly made a great Army let's find out Saul's accomplishment he certainly did he brought Israel to a great Army he made them all with fine polish Spears he trained them with Spears to fight like GRE Gallant men in other words he had the deacons he had the ushers he had everybody in order he made them all big shields and everything else they were real polish and train all to the very minute they were getting along fine the rest of the nation looked out you know Israel coming along PR pretty good but one day God will let it too long you know until one day there came a Challenger by the name of Goliad folded his arms and Israel shook till their shoes were triming on the ground the old Head and Shoulder Above All the Rest shook with them too talking about Saul there he stood he never seen such a thing the spirit had to take over the god of Israel had to show its power there will be a golad somewhere oh Hallelujah we got he said we have got greatest intellectual best dress crowds we got the best theological seminaries finest trained men ever coming they train choirs they could sing how great thou are now they could sing special after special song after song after message songs

Scholars and theology when it come from the supernatural they were stunted they didn't know nothing about it why didn't David know that his Gallant men because he was feeding in another pasture listen to this listen part last quote he was training under another atmosphere oh give the Lord a so let all stand and praise God hallelujah that intellectual mysterious atmosphere that the other was trained
