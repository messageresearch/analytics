thank you you are so good to allow us to see this year 2025 just just a couple of years back they were talking about white Tok and the year 2000 and all the years that's rolled by and father we know you hold the future we know the challenges and the times that LE ahead has prophesied not only by the oh God the Bible but by your 20th century Prophet William Brown as he prophesied what is going to take place in this bright season help us tonight give us cues give us a word may we hear from you tonight that we help us along life's journey where we all live on this planet Earth we have everyday challenges to face help us and equip us and Empower us tonight to deal with every challenge day by day because it's a day byday battle as bar Anthony preached about the Lord possessing and maintaining was a key message oh God for this season and time to know that we could push and possess but we must also maintain and then we could push some more so speak to us tonight by your word may your spirit come down in a special way Spirit of pray supplication touch his sick in our midst remember brother the clarents Lord and touch them and raise them up in good health and strengthen every other person that may be sick and body May touch them and heal them in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and thanks so much coming out tonight this first Friday of 2025 so tonight I want to take a scripture from M Micah 4 and I want to read a line of verse 10 Micah 4: 10 be in pain and labor to bring forth oh daughter of Zan I right there be in pain and labor to bring forth da of Zan my title for this exaltation tonight is labor to bring forth oh Daughter of Zion now we have had two powerful Services possess and maintain and we need to see Jesus the tong word for them reframing your thinking from why this happened to me to why this happened for me the to me part would seek to blame others or things or go down in self-pity why this happened to me because and who and so on but the for me part why this happened for me that part seeks to understand how this would work for your good or what lessons is in it that you can learn and grow because in everything we go through there are lessons and there are things for us to learn and grow not just to be informed not just for knowledge but how can what you go through grow you how you can grow from it for example Luke 2 speaks about Caesar Augustus the word should be taxed and a just pop up like that everyone have to go in their own City Joseph Mary they have to head to Bethlehem to be taxed Mary's exous wife great with child and so it was while they were dear the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaden clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them at in now the why this is happening to me pregnant Mary and that donkey going a merry way and all of a sudden laws change taxation you have to go to your place of origin and something like that heading down but the for me part that Jesus was going to be born not in the place he should be according to prophecy so the Taxation and the laws that was instituted by Caesar Augustus was to get Jesus in position so it doesn't make sense getting a plard and protesting against the government and fighting this and fighting the question is what is this for now the bride would have to have her labor pains to bring forth Messiah and just as a thought maybe that is what the Press is about the the Press is a a forcing a pressing a stress Matthew 9:36 says he said unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few listen to Jesus prayer request pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into his hands I want you to know tonight whether you're old whether you're middleaged whether you're young we are called to be laborers not uh Li All By the Sea relaxing relaxers not entertainers not we are called to be laborers Jesus actually ask that a prayer go for that he would send forth laborers into his Harvest so tonight I'll be speaking a bit about Labor travail and you would get where I'm going tonight 1 Corinthians 3 three says vers six I have planted Apollo watered but God give the increase so neither is he that planted anything neither he water it but God gave the increase now he that planted and he that water it a one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor here we go get to for we are laborers together with God he are God's husbandry he are God's Building so if this scripture here tonight for we are laborers should eliminate those who want to sit back and relax and watch others labor and understand the calling of God that we are to labor and to labor is to press to travail and I use a word in the little letter I sent out from the pastor's desk pleading prayer I find this very interesting not just prayer but pleading prayer pray or travailing prayer if I could use that word St John 1620 says verily I said to you this is Jesus speaking that he shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice he shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned to joy and Jesus contextualized it he put it in a context here by saying a woman when she is in travail at sorrow because the hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remember no more the anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man take it from you travil travail is a term for the painful Pro ESS a woman experiences in giving birth to a child and this is expressed in Genesis 35 verse 16 and it says here and they journeyed from beel and there was but a little way to come to ephra and Rael travailed and she had hard labor and it came to pass when she was in hard labor that the Midwife said unto her fear not thou shall have this also so this thing about working God worked for 6 days and he rested on the 7 this word about Labor this is why he placed man in the Garden of Eden the Bible said there was no man to tell the soil he wanted a man that would take what was dear and expand it grow it Harvest it add to it and the only way this could have been done is to put that spirit being man into flesh that he could till the soil there was no man to till the soil adoption but I'm speaking here he said um then he came down and taken upon himself while he did that he did that here we go church that he might save you who wants to be saved do you see what I mean by for knowledge the infinite God who knowed all things saw the lamb and he slay the lamb before the foundation of the world and he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and he seen here we go the deceitfulness of Satan what he would do so he put your name on dear that he said that the Antichrist would be so religious so good such a fine fellow such a smart man such a religious man that he would deceive the very elected if it was possible it is impossible because their names were foreordained before the foundation of the world by election he chose them and by and by predestination they know where they are going there you are now this is it here now who could doubt that that is what Paul said that is Paul's writing that's what he taught his church the church listen carefully positionally before the foundation of the world and this is the bum here now when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that he place you positionally then when we have come from the G lands of Egypt through sanctification and is baptized into the promised land for the promise of God is the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption then God having predestinated the church he said all the peoples there'll be million times million that shall walk religious and be deceived the only ones that will not be deceived will be those that have come over into the promised land who before the foundation of the world had their names put in the L Book of Life and come over into the promised land and enjoying it and enjoying it so listen friends what we just read here is that God had his labor pain to bring you and I to bring us forth in his own mind so if God had labor pain don't you think that you will escape having lab La pains but BR they told me to preach 2 hours I done it again tonight let me tell you something BR you are either marked in or marked out and if you got a bit of spirit about you tonight that you know that you are wrong here's the old sort tril a mner bench down here for you to stay here and moan and groan under the labor pain until God comes down and fill you with the Holy Ghost let me read that again he said there's a mest bench down here for you to stay here and moon and groan under the labor pains until God come down and F with the ghost you see huh there are thousands and thousands of people go to church go to shrines go to MOS go to whatever but they go to that with a religious frame of mind they go to that almost like bringing what a sacrifice to God offering to God God I'm here thing but this Kingdom that John came to introduce that Jesus preached about he said the kingdom is preached and Men you know what I'm where I'm going press their way into it so just think about it now you as a parent you as a wife or husband you as family you can't take your children in you can Inspire them to press to get in but you can't drag them as a club this is my children and no it it doesn't work that way it's one by one it's individual it's a little more than going to church is to recognize that you have to die out and you have to be born into this glorious Kingdom and you have to be filled with the Holy Ghost and I'm almost done but the Bram and there a particular C that we know when our church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world that Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as the Pentecost how they grown and cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some Pastor evangelist so when these men believing that they are that without this process here they are deceived when these men just take for granted well a preaching I have a voice I have a gift therefore that is that is not so gift and calling without repentance and that is why I'm talk about a scrap people of ministers because they didn't get into it right they figure that because they could go be the pulpit and speak things and say things that's the end of it as we see go looking for a better sermon he looking for a better man a better man will produce a better sermon I'm going to I right sometime from this m short this is one I discovered this Al so beautiful but I'm talking about God was in Christ reconcil the world for him to himself he says God dwelt in the body of Christ here this one he could have come down from heaven right from the corders of heaven with a full Angel salute if he wanted to he could have been born a full mature man he could have come down with all the pump and Glory of heaven but he didn't choose that he come to a stable born in a Manuel Pine little Jehovah Crying In A Manger little Jehovah playing as a boy little Jehovah toiling as a man he cross his cast with us and God become human when Jesus was born God was human on earth manifesting God what he was here we go he toiled and labored and felt for the teenager he went through every Temptation that we go through did you get that Jesus wasn't lazy Jesus wasn't sitting down lying and just carrying on he toiled and labor so he knows what the teenager go through you know what the young men go through not only that he went through every Temptation that means he was tempted by women he was tempted by money he was tempted by popularity what whatever test whatever challenge whatever issue there was at that time he went through Temptation God did it that he might do his own personal his own judgment Justice his judgment has got to be Justice if there no justice what could does it be to have judgment so he took the penalty of his own judgment and died as a sinner to condemn sin in the world that we to his Justice might have reconciliation back to the throne of God in Fellowship oh man isn't that a beautiful thing tonight as we wrap there's a song I am watching for the coming of that glad Millennial day when our blessed Lord shall come and catch his waiting B away oh my heart is filled with Rapture as I labor Watch and Pray our Lord is coming back to it again we know that soon today but Kelly sou sent me something he was asking the Lord about uh Prevail in prayer and he got onto something from Charles finny about prevailing pay and I want to read some of that I just felt it come in time of what I had prepared labor to bring forth a daughter of Z and I want to read that now this is from a lecture that was given upon prevailing prayer the scripture he used was the effectual F prayer of a righteous man and let much and this to me was kind of mind blown the last lecture referred principally to the confession of sin tonight my remarks will be chiefly confined to the subject of intercession or prayer there are two kinds of of means requisite to promote a Revival one to influence men the other to influence God the truth is employed to influence men and prayer to move God when I speak of moving God I do not mean that God's mind is changed by prayer or that his disposition of character is changed but prayer produces such a change in us and fulfills such conditions as renders it consistent for God to do as it would not be consistent for him to do otherwise when a sinner repents the State of Mind makes it proper for God to forgive him God has always been ready to forgive him on that condition so that when The Sinner changes his mind towards God it requires no change of feeling in God to Pardon him it is the sinner's repentance that renders his forgiveness proper and is the occasion of God acting as he does so when Christians offer effectual prayer their state of mind renders that they felt right and offered or let me say yeah when Christians offer effectual prayer their state of mind rended it proper for God to answer them he was always ready to bestow the blessings on the condition that they felt right and offer the right kind of prayer whenever this change take place in them and they offer the right kind of prayer then God without any change in himself can answer them when we offer effectual fervent prayer for others the fact that we offer such prayer renders it consistent for him to do what we pray for when otherwise it would not have been consistent prayer is an essential Link in the chain that causes that lead to Revival as much so as truth is some have zealously used truth to convert men and laid very little stress on prayer they have preached and talked theyed tracks with great Zeal and then wondered that they had so little success and the reason was they forgot to use the other branch of the means effectual prayer they Overlook the fact that Truth by itself will never produce the effect without the spirit of God and that Spirit has given an answer to Earnest prayer sometimes it happens that those who are the most engaged in employing truth are not the most engaged in prayer this is always unhappy for unless they or somebody else have the spirit of prayer the truth by itself self will do nothing but Harden men in impenitence probably in the day of judgment it will be found that nothing is ever done by truth used ever so zealously unless there's a spirit of prayer somewhere in connection with the presentation of Truth others ear on the other side not that they lay too much stress on prayer but they Overlook the fact that prayer might be offered Forever by itself and nothing would be done because for Sinners are not converted by direct contact of the Holy Ghost but by the truth employed as a means to expect the conversion of Sinners by prayer alone without the employment of Truth is to tempt God uh Skelly I thank you for sharing this with me and this is the last thing I have here from Hebrews chapter 4 let us therefore fear least a promise being left us of enter into his rest any of you should seem to come short enough andless any of you means all of us for unto us was the Gospel preached as well unto them but the word preach did not profit them not being mixed with faith that heard them for we which have believed do entered into his rest as he said I want to go down ver verse six seeing therefore it remain that some may enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not because of unbelief verse 8 for if Jesus had given them rest they would not afterwards have spoken of another day therefore there remain a rest to the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his and this is the verse I want to get to let us labor therefore to enter into that rest least any man fall after that same example of unb listen friends there is no no free R the kingdom of God is preached and every man press your way into it all those people who looking for free who looking to say pray for me pray for me pray for me and they would even pray for their own self they would even pray they are so selfish all they want is for them and if they go beyond them is their family that little bubble Circle that you had they don't even look to get enough that they could share for others enough prayer that they could pray Beyond themselves and pray for others the effectual fervent prayer of righteous man of it that much God want to work but God worked through prayer God worked through people with the right Spirit the right mind God gets sick of Saul Saul was on the throne Saul was anointed Saul was preaching Saul was right there but then God says you know what I found a better man be the man you want others to be lead let us lead each one of us by example let us bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight God the daughter of Zion the bride will must have to come into travail it cannot be some worshiping some are not it cannot be some praying some are not it cannot be some oppressing some are not it cannot be that the bride will press the bride will pray the bride will seek the bride with labor Jesus prophesied of Sorrow bird pains travail but joy when that manifestation come forth Lord you prophesied that the full word is to be borne into manifestation God if that is so then it has to have travail it has to have B pains it has to have the Deep sincerity that you require father May begin tonight in this little group all those under the song of my voice there something still in their

Zion don't give up don't give in don't let go ask God to show you how to reframe your thinking because you have to do that Jesus came to change the thinking of his own disciples to let them know what is possible and all things are possible to not believe but let them know the same BS he do he they can do also to change how they think of things and God want to change how we think about things that we could have Embrace Romans 8:28 we know all things work together for good the devil job come to steal Rob and Destroy but Anthony preach to possess and to maintain we have a right to these things because God give it to us we're not claiming it because we feeling clish we're not claiming it because we have nothing else to do we claiming these things because God promised it that why Jesus died that we could possess these promises and we possess them little by little and we took a little tonight little by little we're going to possess that land and maintain that land so may God bless you may have a blessed evening thanks for being here tonight and may God be with you we thisiss God bless
