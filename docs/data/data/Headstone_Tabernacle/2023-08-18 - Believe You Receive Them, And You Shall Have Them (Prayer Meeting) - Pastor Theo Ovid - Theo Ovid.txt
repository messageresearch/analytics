thank you so much and thank all of you here all tonight that is ball heads for the prayer Heavenly Father we thank you that we living in these exciting times exciting times for The Bride of Jesus Christ exciting times to see the Fulfillment of the scriptures exciting times because we are within the command of the Lord father you are promised appear then to come God I pray that you would send the witness of your Holy Spirit into every home tonight everyone got it here right ready um with the anointing of God sweep into their home their rooms wherever they are I'll minister to them immediately needed and Lord may you through the word make an entrance for us in a child a prayer tonight in Jesus might ask that amen God bless you and thanks again for being here I wanted to look at two scriptures tonight Mark 11 verse 22-26 and also Luke chapter 22 verse 32 the 31-32 and um Mark 11 read verse 22. and Jesus answered saith unto them have faith in God this is after Jesus Christ the fig tree and it dried up from the roots for verily I send to you that whosoever shall see unto this mountain be thou removed without casting to the scene and shall not doubt in his heart which I believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatever he said therefore I see unto you what things however you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and he shall have them when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which in heaven forgive your trespasses Luke chapter 22 reinvoice to table and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan had desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat what I have prayed for thee that I fit feel not and when thou art converted strengthened Divergent may God bless his word it's a blessing to be here tonight and I'm thrilled with what I see the Lord is doing and how the world has been unfolded to us no I have a thought about my heart tonight and it's believe you receive them and you shall have them I want to zoom in on verse 24 of Saint Mark 11. therefore I see unto you what things so ever you desire When you pray believe you receive them and he shall have them so this particular verse is where I want to zoom in tonight whatsoever things what things whatever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and it shall happen you know we know 25 and 26 is like a sub close or like a fine print of the power of praying in other words you're wasting your time praying if ever ought you have a grudge you wasting a time just in words no we could see prayers we could say words but we're talking about praying or real effective prayer which I want to show you tonight prayer push his feet to go on by the words you use by what you see it actually pushes fit to God IT projects Faith to God that's what prayed us so when you're praying he said oh you listen to the words and vain words and whatnot no you want to know who you're praying to because people do that they have those with beads with citizens over and over will be sharp please and there's people who are prayer books there are people who have daily prayer and daily word and whatever it is and that is just seeing stuff that's not praying no listen to this now God can move mountains but fit moves God can heal any condition but fit moves God to heal God can deliver but Faith moves God to bring that Deliverance believe you have received them and you shall have them now I discovered this word it's called appropriation or to appropriate the correct appropriation of faith and the appropriate is to take something for one's own use and I like this definition appropriate to take something for one's own use because it separates you as an individual and it clarifies why Jesus Jesus told his disciples it wasn't one of them or two of them there's a bunch of them if you shall see to the mountain the moon you personal responsibility personal fit personal world so to appropriate is to take something for one's own use it is to take possession of it is to take over it is to assume it is to lay claim to it is to clean so when he says when you pray believe you have received you appropriate and receiving it before you even get it you are saying I claim it you are saying it is Minds personally you are not identifying a general something you are seeing this healing that I'm looking for it's mines and I claim it I appropriate it on my feet I use this part of what I unbelievable what I'm standing for I'm holding on to it do you get it tonight now Jesus in talking to Peter it's important to note that he told Peter the devil want to say for like wheat but I've prayed for thee what was Jesus pray that thy fit feel not note he didn't pray for Peter's Deliverance because Faith moves God that can deliver he preached for Peter's feet and feet is the foundation of the Christian walk and your prayer reveals what your faith has appropriated or what you take possession of or what you take as your own all that you are the prophet said all that you ever will be is based on fit in the wood All That You Are all that you ever will be is based upon fate in this world therefore guard your feet and if you guard your feet you would shun unbelief you would shun people that are want to bring negatives and stuff because you want to protect your feet you would avoid the odds and the issues and other people because you want to guard that feat okay now I want to run through something quickly I will see how the law will do this now no there was a guy but if I'm describe it I don't know the man never seen in my life a man come to me and told me you wanted me to pray for him that will be healed of prostrate trouble and he said I was here once he said he told me the story I was set in a meeting way back in the balcony it was Mr Brandon's meeting all at once listening to this I begin to feel a strange feeling come over me and said then the man turned around from where he was preaching and said the man sitting up there so and so a certain man from a certain place and said he's praying that he will be healed or prostrate trouble and he said if he will only accept it and believe it now he can go home and be well he said something struck me I never felt anything like it in my life and for a solid Year my prostrate never bothered me and it come on me again the man name I guess the money was Mr Church the money was church so Mr Church said then don't you see that show that Mr Brown is false if God heal a man he'll heal him for life I thought Mr Church how many times have you come up on the Silver Hills come around and get all those Nursery Sanctified this year I'm next to you sanctify another bunch of them maybe they didn't have it to begin with God wouldn't be real see said this and Church believe us I want to get this to me Divine Healing and sanctification and the powers of God is as long as your faith lasts in it when your faith feels when your experience is gone it is based that way simply upon the finished works of Christ at Calgary you are sanctified as long as your testimony is right as long as you live a Sanctified life and believe that God sanctify you you are sanctified continent all to his grief on his merits as long as you accept healing and believe your healing and go and believe in it like that you'll be healed as long as you believe it you start doubting it you take a mind sitting here this morning that's not a bit sick let him begin to get his heart believing he's sick then pack him out the building as your faith is so be it unto you that is not Christian Science I am not meaning mind over matter but you see the thing of it is is the atmosphere that you live in okay let's go there's another one I might say to this audience this afternoon how many is Christians perhaps 95 or maybe 100 hands their questions as long as you believe that all right but the minute that you begin to think that you're not that's the time you start thinking right here that's the time your testimony is negative Divine Healing last just as long as your faith lasts with it your salvation is the same everything of God Is by feet and nothing of God can be proven by natural so we are challenging tonight challenging you tonight to believe what you can't prove just just think about it you are believing what you can't prove that God is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek it let's go now he said Abraham could possess that land because God give it to him you know lot was part of that land so Abraham had a right to it he could call or lay hold of it so he is showing how Abram could appropriate his faith correctly like how I want you to appropriate fit to move God tonight correctly you want to be healed you have to move God what's the currency that moves God or what's what's what's the the connection that influences God it's fit faith not so long in the message not how old you are no not how long you are as a believer somebody could come in yesterday day before and because of their faith they get whatever God promised okay so watch this now even better write it you could lay he could call or lay hold of it he said no God you may be the promise and what was this land and all and it was mine give me the promise I know my Kingsman has been taken and all he's got is gone in other words if I apply today I would say Church could see could say and we could pray Lord God here's my brother he's laying here strictly with cancer he's tricking with tuberculosis he's got so and so I lay all of the promise it's my possession do you see how he is showing and revealing here how to appropriate feet correctly you're not open now you're actually doing some cleaning here I layer all of the promise it is my possession you told me so amen there you are then you can go after that enemy the devil and Slaughter it just as Abraham slaughtered the Kings and brought back his possession yet Abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his yet he had to fight to possess it here you are the believer today we're heir to all things we're here to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises yet you have to fight every inch for it that is the way God's got it set up it's always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own you have to fight to possess it and that's what we have to do now you see brother Brandon I need healing the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't gonna get it easy I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you have got a right to go and say give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord the possess of everyone of it I'm his Heir give it back you took my child you gotta mix up with the wrong boy you took my boy mix up with the wrong girl I claim that you see so this is appropriation I claim them I claim my children I claim my brother I claim my sister I hope you could see how you're going to be praying tonight I hope you get appropriate things of the promises of God tonight I hope you can make real claims tonight yes Satan took them from the God's house and Cooks them out there but I'm coming after them I claim them well how you know I'm here of all things it's given to me I'm here I and clean everything that God promised me there you are it's mines how do you get it something you've done no no sir is the unmerited gift that God gave us so let's say somebody backs in vaccine for years they came to the Lord two months ago one month ago this year tonight applies to them they have claims now what the devil will do you've got to say nothing you'll face you have you but faith is unconscious things never want to say well you know you back sitting you you can't move so fast you can't meet them kind of claims yet you know you have to wait a while why is the devil trying to mess with your mind but guard your feet tonight watch it is mine how do you get it something you have done no sir it's the unmerited gift that God gave us it's ours it belongs to us see them cannot hold it if you go to him in the scriptural authoritative word with fit to see in his Minds lay it down Glory say I like that Satan you lay it down you took it from me you give it back I'm serving notice almost done in the message persevere in Chicago second of August 96 extreme he was talking about the word perseverance meet at the persistence and so on and before you can be persistent you have to have faith in what you're trying to achieve and listen to this part and you say no that little would fit means so much and yet we strike it so lightly I hear so many people coming it's amazing see I've got faith I'm not disregarding the effort but you know sometimes those that clean they have so much fit I find has less than those that say nothing about it they are built up to an emotion but not a real fit these are quite a bit different and I hope and what I hope an emotion with hope that being quiet and using Faith see faith is something it's a substance it is not something that you just jump up and haphazardly it at and hope so it is something that you know here we go it is something that you know you have it the thing that you're asking for there is no human way of ever explaining how you're going to get it but you know it is dear you have it it's a substance now if I could get that so that you could understand clearly it would mean so much to the meeting tonight in this night of this healing sins and we are trusting I say healing because I believe that God is going to do it I believe that God is going to do what he promised to do and if I didn't do that I'd be afraid to stand here in this audience that people I'll make these statements that I do make because I had a least bit of fear about it I never emitted that door here we go now you have got to absolutely believe it and you have the Assurance there is nothing can move it no matter what happens you still believe it even though it seemed like it failed you still believe it no matter what happens you still believe it there we go as we close state isn't something that somebody else is trying to get you to do this is beautiful I just look that sleeping alone it's a Powerhouse so you see how appropriation is personal is to take something for one's own use so faith isn't something that somebody else is trying to get you to do it is something God commissioned you to do see see you know I see the lady she's very sick but Intoxicated by drug trying to get well Dr Giver I seen her sit and laugh and rejoicing and what's the use of me going down there after it's already over see someone say but Mr way would have he would have he would have laid there he would have do this but when the woman was back outside yet the vision come she is sitting here tonight fine laughing last night you see you have got to know there we go and you cannot know until you are fit and faith produces the new soul faith is that no faith is a thing that sees it for example tonight fit speaks to you but this is a special night your prayer will be different tonight because fit declares it to be so I am believing that you're going to reach deeper further higher in God by your feet tonight as you realize Faith Swiss God or move God remember the woman with the dead baby in Mexico and Usher was trying to calm Adam and she was passing through their legs and everything else and were around Mark somebody one pray for because you don't know who he is and she push and press her faith went up to God God touched the prophet gave him a vision see the baby smiling she'll let her come what did they do there Faith took that woman from the back and bring her to the front her feet a Mexican woman Catholic most likely wasn't a baptized believer or Saint a God but her feet hit him have him touch his Prophet his Prophet had to pray all of that is in the program and plan of God and the final quote I have tonight as we pray is this talking about the associate Revival is starting the Pentecostal mission in California all Azusa Street he was laughed at with the Negro he was made fun of but he brought a message for that age just a boy a fellow could have this on his own name but the Lord had revealed to him that's it right there reveal to him that this was the age for the restoration of those gifts and they come no matter what said it come and everybody got in the atmosphere of it and seemed was that age and seen God Vindicated and those people could speak in tongue so forth and it happened it happened so tonight with the revelation of Dynamics but the revelation of virtue of officers where the revelation of your Pawn of the spirit to bring forth you as a seed you could pray with confidence tonight knowing that the water of the Holy Ghost is going to come upon you and governor and the last thing I want to close up with tonight is that the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals so you could be your host tonight at individual and the Holy Ghost pours out upon you less bald heads heavenly father I thank you tonight I believe that this is a word and season and I bless you lord it's just this evening that I was able to get these things and I never saw the appropriation the way it came Lord and I've seen it right now all we pray is an expression of the faith that we have and the confidence and trust that you have in you and you said Jesus when you pray believe you have received and you shall receive it's a claiming it's an appropriation it's attributing is already done it is saying it's a finished work it is singing my family's already delivered it's a saying I'm Healed Oh Glory to God it's a saying I'm sealed I'm I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I'm baptized I'm claim it I claim it tonight mighty movement of the Holy Spirit upon my life just as sanctification has to be held up by feet just as justification I shall be held up by faith the Holy Ghost has to be held up by faith every stage of this journey must be a walk of faith we walk by faith at night and not by sight father as the people go wrong in prayer with the anointed come down in a special way give them the anointed give them the unction to cry out unto you for this revival the crafting to you for this promised seal of the Living God the craft unto you for the Holy Ghost on Fire I claim it for them Father I claim the fire of the Holy Ghost will touch every heart every mind every soul may the church be Sanctified by the power of God but it's just been cleaned up from the pulpit to the back bench granted father in Jesus might ask it amen amen God bless you thanks again for being here get on in prayer and believe you have received and you shall receive God bless together and pray tonight praise the Lord [Music]
