certainly a great honor to be in fellowship around the word of god in such a time as this we thank god for his grace for his love for his mercy for his promises for his word that has never failed and can never fail and um uh before we get started we want to go to the throne of grace and um we do have uh firstly a note of praise and then we have two prayer requests uh tonight and that we want to take before the throne before we get into this bible study tonight uh a note of praise i think this request i believe went up uh last week uh from alice robinson wants to give god praise for his mighty healing touch from kovid at the age of 90. she said it's the grace of god her daughter give thanks to god and all those who prayed on their behalf so we thank god for that testimony tonight and we do have two prayer requests uh one for sister christine she's requesting prayer for an infection under her toes it has gotten worse and she's having problems standing and walking and she's giving god thanks in advance for healing and also for sister kangale requesting prayer for her left eye having some high pressure in the eye she did two tests and we'll be seeing the specialist tomorrow please go out to know the results believing god for his healing and if tonight uh there's anyone else who is under the sound of my voice tonight and you have a request that you were not able to send in and you want to lift your hand bow ahead close your eyes as we approach the throne of grace tonight he's a mighty healer he's a mighty restorer he's a waymaker and time and time again we have seen prayer requests become notes of praise so let us bow our heads in reverence and respect to god tonight our gracious heavenly father we thank you for your love for your grace for your mercy lord for lord what you have done for us we come tonight lord not as beggars we come tonight understanding who we are that we are sons and daughters of the living god and you said all i was in god you poured into christ and all that is in christ you pour into the church lord and you died on calvary and you paid it all lord you paid for salvation you paid for healing you paid for deliverance it's already paid for it doesn't need to be paid for it's already paid for so lord we thank you lord that you have given us access to what has been paid for so we come tonight lord to make a withdrawal from what you have already paid for we come tonight to make a withdrawal for our sister christine and we come against that infection lord in the name of jesus christ right now lord may the holy spirit move into that room and touch her from the crown of our head to the souls of our feet lord we bind and dispatch angels against that infection and we proclaim healing in the mighty powerful name of jesus christ and lord for sister kangale lord with that pressure in the eye we pray dear god and even now it will be normalized lord we do not come to believe the doctor's report we want your report and may your report supersede any report from the doctor may you bring healing to her right now father and if there's anyone in this room tonight with whatever situation whatever lord problem whatever challenge be it physical be it lord emotional be it financial be it lord a family situation whatever it might be be it a spiritual challenge whatever it might be tonight lord we bring it all under the authority of the holy spirit tonight we thank you for your blood that covers a multitude of sins we thank you for making a way for us when we had no hope we had no chance we had no possibility or opportunity but lord you have opened it up lord that we can have access to you not by our merit not by our ability not by anything we could have ever done but your love reached us found us called us so father we thank you tonight for uniting us by your blood father we are from different walks of life lord and there's no way possible we could come to know one another had it not been because of you so we thank you for the love that we feel although we may be disconnected in these times lord we are still united as one body as a portion of this great mystical body so father may you touch your children tonight may you touch everyone tonight lord young old lord may you touch every believer may you touch everyone who is strong in faith and looking to get stronger may you touch those who might be weaker and looking to get strength may you give a charge in the church tonight lord to keep pressing the battle we pray our blessing on our pastor lord upon the ministry upon the officers the helps the governments the the teams the groupings the leaders the families lord those that we can see here in this room those that are behind the cameras lord we don't know who they all may be but we pray their god that you would reveal yourself to each one in a personal way that they will come to know you by revelation and by experience may you take me completely out of the way and may you speak to your children lord may you bring my thoughts and ideas under your control and lord may you push it away and may you speak what needs to be said tonight to your children in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen and amen i certainly want to thank you all for your diligence and for your commitment and for your dedication and it's not a dedication to the church it's not the dedication to the ministry it's a dedication unto the lord it's what we do because we are called to something higher and we respond to this spiritual calling that keeps us above the water as it will it's very easy to drown in these times and it's a very difficult time for so many people in so many ways and we are being challenged uh to respond to these different things that are happening around us and um so i pray tonight that your faith you know as jesus would have prayed it would not fail and that you would take courage and strength to navigate what we are going through all the way to the rapture to the wedding supper to being able to share your own testimony of how you made it over of how you made it through how you made it through 2020 how you made it through 2021 and how much of a time the lord will allow us to to be on this journey on this side you know i really want to appreciate all of the all of the services that have uh been going on i am blessed i trust you are as well i want to salute brother ovid for the bible studies he he he took up a mantle over the last few weeks you know and i really want to salute him for that and the dedication with the prayer meetings and certainly for the inspiration for the services that are streamed out um and it's such a great privilege and such a blessing to see the stored up food that god has has allowed us to be able to feast on that uh when you listen to some of these services you're wondering if it's preaching this month or this month and then you hear you know 2018 2016 20 and realize that you know god has a way that when things come from eternity they could apply to time in different ways so we are trusting god tonight um so i like to get into this teaching i i i was telling my wife um those few weeks that i wasn't here i feel like i come here for the first time um it feels you know like like like a new experience so we just go out tonight um as we go into his wood i have a uh uh a thought for tonight it's somewhat i don't want to use the word strange maybe just a word different but in my heart i want to encourage us you know and for a few weeks i've been telling bird over i want to look at this study i want to look at the story and um we were talking and he says weeks are telling me looking at this thing you know i say i still want to look at this study you know and the more i looked into it is the more my mind was blown with how it unfolded um you know and to see how much thing got locked up in there um for us you know so you know when we go through life if i could just talk a little bit before the teaching um there are certain things as you get more mature you begin to value more and more you know um as you get older as you go through different experiences uh certain things take on greater meaning you know the desire or the hunt you may have to acquire wealth or physical assets uh begin to fade when other things may become a priority you know priorities change depending on your stage of life you know you go through a period of time when you're younger where schooling and education may be important and it is a rush to get qualified to get a job and then it is expected or it is understood or it is desired that the whole context of employment and a job is to be able to get a home and be able to maybe have a family and maybe be in a position at a certain point in time to be able to retire you know and when i was looking at these these elements and i looked at the broad categories um of these things most of what people fight for most of what people contend for most of what people argue and debate about really reside in three main areas most of the stresses of our lives can be traced to three mean categories wealth people stress about their wealth being able to pay for things having things not having things you struggle of having things and family issues in and around family and health so if you were to identify three main factors that for your journey of life would be an area of discussion conversation debate contention stress concern worry perplexity it's something typically to do with your family with your wealth or with your health you know as i was looking at the context because for those who have been around for a while i believe that the gospel is is a practical real living gospel it's not so mysterious that we can't apply it to our lives and the struggles of our daily lives how we deal with family and family situations how we deal with relationships and people who are in contact with us and we could consider all that part of family it could be blood family or extended family but i debate around family and people who are in your circle the whole debate of wealth and and and and job and career and money and saving and providing and these things and on your health and i was looking at and just so you know i'm going into the story of job tonight because the story of job is a story that deals with wealth it deals with family and it deals with health these three great factors and if i want to give tonight a title for this study tonight it'll be loss pain and betrayal a study of job loss pain and betrayal a study of job the title may sound somewhat down but i could assure you it's a feat building teaching loss pain and betrayal a study of job and i'm letting you know that it is to build your feet it is not by the end of this teaching you leave sad and depressed but the reality is friends at some point in time we have to deal with loss we have to deal with pain and we have to deal with betrayal lost pain and betrayal would typically affect one or all of these three areas of our lives family wealth and our health many suffer the painful loss and you could combine your words now painful loss of family painful loss of wealth painful loss of health many of the issues in business come from the betrayal something of trust that was broken or breached some of the issues with family is that of betrayal you never thought somebody would have done this you didn't think that was the stand they would have taken and all of these are issues of life that are real to us so i want to journey if you would and kind of see what god placed in the wood around loss pain and betrayal around wealth family and health and to see the journey of this man called job who to this day is still a mystery there are many things in a book of job that is mysterious we speak of job and we preach about job in in a very in a very focused way at times and few people realize that job or the book of job rather has 42 chapters in the book of job so job is an immense drama that is played out for us so by the grace of god i i don't know how far i'll get but i want you to ride with me i want you to drive with me if you will from journey to journey along this journey and by the grace of god if if i could get to the end of the story tonight um we'll trust god to get there so we'll start with [Music] we will not be able to read the entire book tonight so we will read some scriptures we will jump over a few of them and to identify certain patterns and then we'll pull out a few things so but we do want to start with job 1 1 and i want you to draw attention to the fact that jobs chapter 1 and 2 form somewhat of an introduction of this story between chapters 3 and chapters 37 is like another stage of expression of job story and we're going to reach let's call that stage 3 and then after joe 37 we have job 38 onwards which is we'll call it stage four for the purpose of this teaching tonight so stage one is chapter one stage two is chapter two stage three is chapters three the 37 and then 38 on what is four all right i hope i haven't lost anybody so jew of one one there was a man in a land of us or whose which history would place somewhere around saudi arabia or no or north arabia but in that arabian area there was a man in the land of who's whose name was job that man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and extrude evil in the amplified it says there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was blameless and upright so perfect and upright in the king james blameless and upright but we get the picture you couldn't put your finger on this man there was something about him and and this first verse here we are reading about is about his character so it's about a man all right there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright one that feared god and we understand the value of fear and god we have done many teachings on the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom we have we have gone through that one who feared god and he amplified it says with reverence and abstain from and turn away evil is in the amplified so this estude evil is a two-part thing abstain from and turn away f from and i want to just touch on this because this thing is so profound when you drive slowly abstain from and turn away from abstain is when you have the control so you are actively deciding i'm not going to go somewhere because it's evil i'm not going to do a certain thing because it's evil that's the kind of man job was so i want to establish in our hearts and minds this man called job as a tie for us to look at our lives through this lens of job and the experience of job and the struggles of job and yet the testimony of job that we are supposed to aspire to that he would on the one hand abstain from evil which means avoid it at all costs it means not deliberately put yourself in a position that could be deemed evil but the flip side of it and turned away from evil applies to sometimes in life their situation that you didn't control you didn't put yourself there but evil is present it's one thing to drive into a club and you choose to go to a club it's another thing to go to a family member's home and you didn't expect it to be a certain kind of situation but then the change it changes while you're there you didn't know it was going to be that way you didn't plan to be there to see what was going on but because the situation changed you turn away from evil and now you exit the scene or you move away or you go somewhere else this was the metal of this man job and i want it to be practical for us because this gospel that we preach this message that we live for is one that is manifested in our lives and we can see clearly here from chapter one verse one this man is a man who we would call a real christian you couldn't put your thing on him he wasn't wondering what his testimony was it is very clear it covers every base perfect and upright feared god and is chewed evil it's a testimony we should all wish or desire or pray that if somebody were to write about us these are the things that they would see here is a man named so-and-so or there's a sister named so-and-so who is perfect and upright you can't put a blame on them they stand up a certain way and they fear god and they as true evil so we are established on the character and nature of the man because the nature and the character of the man is what leads to the unfolding of what will come next so we're going to move from chapter one verse one i hope not going too slowly but i want us to really really understand what we're looking at tonight all right so two and they were born unto him seven sons and three daughters so here we move from the man to his family you with me all right so we moved from the man in chapter one to a view of his family in verse two seven sons and three daughters now we're gonna move from his family to his wealth we talked about what affects our lives our wealth our family our health so in the first three verses of job we moved from the man to his family to his wealth his substance also was seven thousand sheep and 3 000 camels and 500 yoke of oxen and 500 she asses and a very great household so is that so that listen this man was the greatest of all the men of the east i want us to pause there for a minute because we preach and talk about job but many of us miss the fact that by all descriptions by the forbes magazine of its day by whatever credential you want to attribute to the stature of this man here we have scripture defining that this was the greatest of all the men of the east this is not a news reporter this is not an article this is not an investigative report this is scripture defining that when the assessment is made this man job was wealthy he was the greatest of all the men of the east yet still he was perfect yet still he was upright yet still he feared god yet still he eschewed evil which meant that his wealth his success his reputation the respect that was garnered for him was ghana the correct way he didn't do it on their hand there was no crooked activity his testimony was consistent you could not put a finger to him anybody with me tonight we are building bear in mind again our teaching tonight is a loss pain and betrayal you can't lose what you don't have you will not get pain if there's nothing that could ever hurt you and there's no betrayal if there's nobody to betray you or there's not something worth betraying so we are painting the picture here in verse one two and three thus far and now we move from the man to his family to his wealth and back to his character verse four and his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone his day all right for bible scholars and for the way scripture is written everyone his day is referring to his birthday that that's what it refers to there so if you if you don't study it you'll see it so everyone his day everyone has their day so it's the day of the year so basically every one of these sons on their birthday would have a big celebration you know people there's their pits out there some people when they come they they want to hide it they want to take it secret they don't want to wait to know it's a baby they they take a time to reflect there's nothing wrong with that people have choices with how they treat with their bodies not jobs boys job's boys all seven of them made up made it is a serious it's not a thing to play with all right and his sons went and this is not having me feasted in their houses everyone his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them listen to verse five and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about listen now to this man called you watch the character of the manju that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all so job wanted to know who was there what all you did there i know always celebrating your birthday but i want to be able to offer according to the number of them all for job said it may be without evidence of what took place in the body party he said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts not even from their lips you know in their hearts thus did job continually so job's love for his sons was so great so i want you to show the connections it was not that job was estranged from his boys it wasn't that job had no relationship with his sons it wasn't that job didn't know what is going on with them he was so in tune with them and their lives and what they did and their habits and their customs and their nature that at the point of knowing that they had a birthday party he went and gave an offering to god just in case one of them thought something in their hearts they cursed god and his love for them wanted to protect them so much that he wanted to give an offering to cover them he wasn't worrying if they wanted to give an offering for themselves he wasn't saying i'm so busy mining my sheep and my flock that i hope i don't have time for them and they're on their own i'm giving context i'm i'm not describing anybody i'm not pointing fingers to anybody i'm painting a picture of the quality the character the nature of this man job anybody with me tonight at the rate i'm going i'm not going to finish tonight but work with me so many singers get so good at so long and there's i was kind of trying to get him the essence of it so he could see it as if you're there seeing a man job he has decisions to make he has a business to run he has more property more animals than everybody else and yet still hearing his sons he is not there at the border party but hearing what's going on with him he makes it his business to get up listen what the bible said he did it continually rose up early in the morning so you're not getting up 11 o'clock i wonder if that boys clean up no he is diligent about it he is consistent about it there's no accident with his actions he is deliberate he is intentional he has a plan he is doing his research he's not leaving it to accident he's not leaving it a chance he is interested in the well-being the welfare the success of his boys you don't want them to get into trouble is this coming real to us yet verse 6 now we switch from it is as if the author is now painting these pieces of the picture for us the success of job the man called job the structure of job what makes him unique his wealth his fame his success his family life is the perfect picture of what we aspire to be to have to achieve to do to live the testimony it's that balance between life and godliness it's all they are painted here between verse 1 and verse 6. and then verse 6 comes now there was a day when the sons of god angels came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them now the heat gets turned up and the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou in other words satan what are you doing and i find this question to be interesting because god could have gone straight to the point he wanted to get to but it is as if the author wants us to be clear of what satan's activity was before attending the meeting so when's comments though everything in scripture is deliberate this is not an accidental question god don't have time to just make conversation people there's no idle word in scripture so so this is god saying to us if he was ever wondering what satan is up to let me ask the question so for our benefit in 2021 we could know what he's up to and the lord said unto satan once come as thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it in other words the devil not sitting down either playing pitch playing marble playing internet watching youtube the devil do have time for that he is moving around looking for prey looking for weakness looking for vulnerability looking to see what he could do he's he is actively pursuing stuff i want us to get this so it's a picture here of satan's activity and in the midst of this here we have verse eight and the lord unto satan hast thou considered my silver job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man you know what it is for god to describe you as a perfect and upright man this is not your neighbor you know i've preached if your neighbor have a testimony about you check your testimony if your wife can't say something good about you check your testimony if your husband oh don't don't let me go there tonight never show any reviews here everybody just reverse out that street i'll come another street this is not the neighbor saying perfect and upright you know this is god telling satan have you considered has though considered my servant job not just consider him you know he is given the conditions about consideration that there is none like him in the earth one a perfect and an upright man to one that feared god and a steward evil so basically god the author of this book is repeating of his own choice chapter one verse one of job he is repeating it to the devil see if he didn't read it in chapter one verse one let me tell you about this man jew anybody with me ought to have the kind of testimony that god will say have you considered myself on clarence have you have you considered myself michael have you considered my daughter pauline have you considered don't you know that god speaks about his children as any as any happy proud father anybody with meat tonight it's something else when you see a child who's something you're proud about you want to tell other parents you want to tell other people you want to tell and and it's so god feeling good he says satan what he was doing i know you're too unfro body in people but yeah listen have you considered have you have you have you considered myself on job that there's none like him in the earth you're messing with all kinds of different people but take a look at this one here perfect and upright one that feared god and is true with evil bear in mind friends job is you always book any bible then satan answered the lord and said so satan's answer confirms the fact that he has been considering him because consideration meters started to look at he said the job fair god for not in other words and i said this before i believe in the last teaching in the security profession they have what they call soft targets and higher targets so they say when criminal elements looking for a house they look for soft targets soft targets mean there aren't visible signs of defenses you know so a heart attack it is when you put up a sign beware of the dog you might have no dog on it but just this sign beware of the dog sort of make somebody think twice do i really want to engage with a dog tonight or if you see a camera hanging up you don't know if it's real but just the visible center of a camera suggests that this is a harder target than the house next door with no sign of nobody we have no dog no camera so so so satan is saying the job fear god for naught listen to verse 10 has down not made an hedge about him and many times talk about the hedge about him but the bible goes on has thou has not done made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he had on every side listen i said i rejoice in just this scripture no no no because i recognize that when god said to bless you when david says cop run over this thing is a real thing the hedge was not just a wrong job because of job's testimony the head was about his house because of job's testimony the head was about all that he had on every side sometimes we worry about our children and our family and what we should be doing is getting so right with god so that god expand the edge expand the hedge around us to cover our families oh come on somebody help me tonight oh god help me to live so upright help me to have such a testimony but by my testimony it could extend to my house and i could say as for me and my house we will serve the lord oh anybody feel that way tonight so so listen satan's analysis of the situation not only picked up the protection that was around job it was evident that satan's research also surfaced the fact that job's family was protected those who were connected to job was protected and as a result of this satan say i don't even go in there hallelujah but i branham said you can live such a life that's it i don't know what to do with you oh god help me tonight i feel like getting up this chair i don't know what's gonna happen tonight you know you can live such a life that he devil don't even know what to do with you so satan was admitted by what he saw about this man job he had no weapons he could bring to the table come on now i want you to i want you to catch this here satan was realizing that he had nothing to bring to the stabilized joke he couldn't bring anything and it was not job's hedge it was the lord's hedge that was around job so when god put a hedge around you and put a protection around you and put angels dispatched around you to know that fear you think anybody could come in your area unless god allows it because he is the gatekeeper he is the one controlling the edge anybody with me tonight i try to lay a foundation this looks like but the clarence i was very careful to not call this part one because i have said part one many times i never got to part two so i tell myself i'm not saying part one because per adventure i don't get a part two but this look like it might have a part two wilson has do has not done mean and hedge about him and about his house and about all he had on every side listen this is this is powerful this is not this is not god speaking here i want you to catch this this is listen to the continuation thou has blessed the work of his hands you don't think the devil knows when god bless you you don't think demons are aware that the blessing of the lord is upon your life i want you to i want this to resonate upon you i want you to understand who you are in the context of this current situation to understand why your head should not be down why you should not be depressed why you should not be frustrated though has blessed the works of his hands and his substance is increased in the land all of that satan checking your bank accounting marveling at the blessing upon job by virtue of what his testimony his life and the blessing of the lord and here comes satan putin for the challenge but put further in hand now and touch all that he had and he will curse thee to thy face so this was the challenge now this was if this was a game if this is the game the game ends when job would curse god to his face everybody with me so the devil put this out as the line in his son that defines successful failure of job testimony he says put forth thy hand now and touch all that he had so this was going after substance all that he had all that he possessed this is not touching job now the first issue satan had was touch his possessions and what does he get this and satan because he doesn't know i want us to appreciate the fact that satan doesn't have this knowledge the same way satan had to ask jesus if thou be satan is still trying to figure you out just like he was trying to figure jesus out satan is asking this under the belief that if he touches job's possessions it would break job's confidence and faith and trust in god god on the other hand is looking at this and in his heart he's saying job's fate his trust his love his testimony is bigger than his possessions so whether he has the possession or doesn't have the possession his walk of uprightness is not going to change so god is confident to be able to respond in verse 12 and the lord said unto satan behold all that he has as in all of his possessions his business his money his assets his substance everything around them including his family all that is his possessions is in thy power only upon himself in other words don't touch job at all but touch everything around him only upon himself put not fought thy hand so satan went fought from the presence of the lord let's go on with driving verse 13 and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and they came a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them and the serbians fell upon them and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee while he is yet speaking so he talk in this thing while he is talking they come another and said the fire of god is fallen from heaven and i'd burn up the sheep and the servants and consume them and i only am escaped alone to tell thee so it's like bad news running into bad news running into bad news as soon as one man coming to the end of his bad news a new bad news start right while he was yet speaking i don't know how many people could deal with this this is very stressful while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away ye and slain thy servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee while while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in that in their eldest brother's house and behold there came a great win from the wilderness and smaller four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tell thee so in quick succession this is in one day this is not over a period of time he loses his wealth he loses his young sons verse 20 then job arose rent his mantle shaved his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped lord help us and said naked came i out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return to the the lord gave and the lord had taken away blessed be the name of the lord and the bible said in verse 22 in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly so charge god foolishly means to blame god so in all of this all of this he said not and he didn't blame god he lost his assets he lost his family so in that in this one day think about it friends in this one day we started off talking about family wealth and health in one day he suffered and we talk about lost pain and betrayal we'll get to the betrayal of that but in one day he suffered the loss and the pain of losing his wealth and losing his family and all of that is in chapter one of the book of job that has 42 chapters are we ready to keep driving friends job chapter 2 verse 1 again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord and the lord said unto satan from whence comes down it's as if this is a repeat of what you saw in chapter one and satan answered the lord and said this is ella listen the devil and idol from going to and from the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan no this is there are some things you try to understand and the lord i tell you the lord is wonderful when you unfold listen to see what god brings with in job listen i don't know how many people could really deal with job one and properly survive like it's not like we're talking about this thing but these things are real thing you know losing one child can mush up people losing two children could master people here job lose on the same day you're here you find out that this thing people get nervous break down for less than that way less than that and it really goes to show that those who are built in this age with this hour for the bride who are chosen by god they build different in them those who are built for this this is not everybody those who built this they built different because on top of what job is dealing with here the lord has not considered my silver jew that there is none like him in the ut a perfect and upright man one that feared god and his truest evil and listen to the next line that god hit and still he hold it listen i was studying this and those two words and still i just stopped and i was like and still and still despite it all and still god was looking at job and saying after all of that and still he hold it and still listen you know we are real and still in this room you know you know how much has gone wrong in our lives and still we're here tonight hallelujah you know how much reasons we had to give up and still you're standing you're but everyone's preaching you say i might be a wounded eagle i might have lost a wing but i am still an eagle and the same way you feel when you feel like giving up and chewing in your toe well is the same way god looks at you and see and still this standing 20 21 and still they're standing look what they lost and still they're standing and god is speaking and i and my mind is blown we know these things but when you process it slowly and say look how god come back and say and still so god is now considering the events of chapter one fully conscious of the pain that job went through and still sin you see in other words it's almost like he taunted a villain he said you're considered job i tell you about this job i tell you this job different you challenge him and look he's still standing oh hallelujah look at him he's still standing you thought he went backslide you thought he would give up you're taught he what cuz the message you're taught he would say this thing is not real but look on a tuesday night he's still in bible study you're not gonna not this job not this job no amount of loss no amount of pain no amount of betrayal will take his joy away come on now somebody help me tonight nothing you do to his wealth nothing you do to his family nothing you do to his health will make him curse god will make him recount on his testimony that his god is real he's the same yesterday today and forever and is still able to bring every promise to pass i told you don't let the title fool you this is a fee building message lost pain and betrayal we could handle it we could deal with it nobody said it's easy nobody said it's gonna be easy new road wasn't promised to be easy but we are billed for pressure and still he hold it fast his integrity i love it although thou moves me against him to destroy him without cause so you don't think god knows what's going on you think understand god understand what he allowing to happen to us in different ways for our character to be formed for our testimony to be developed and satan answered the lord and i made it clear in chapter one god allowed the devil to touch everything around him but don't touch him he could have touched his wealth he could touch his family but he can never touch his health he can never touch his person but here it is now the devil goes in for this third element now and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man half will he give for his life powerful statement you know much millionaires would trade all their wealth to get more time on the youth people studied i look back at steve jobs who built apple billionaire he spent an incredible millions of dollars millions of dollars he could have spent he spent all he could possibly spend trying to get a cure for his cancer he was willing to give every check he tried every study natural everything he could possibly try he did everything he possibly could and the devil understand that he said listen skinfish can alter manhattan will he give for his life in other words in the balance of wealth against health and living and life a man will say keep my house if if i'm on a dead bed and and i can trade my house for more time i will take the house does it meet jeff man i gotta share it with it everybody wants to go to heaven nobody wants to die i want to go to heaven when i die and you see you ready to get you you're ready to go no no but not yet here it is devil understanding nature he says skin for skinny or what a man of heart will he give his life put forth that hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold he is in dying hand but save his life in other words attack his health but don't kill him because now that is the full extent of what you could go to now you don't touch his wealth you don't touch his family now you're good at his health do what you want him but don't touch his life don't kill him so went satan fought from the presence of the lord and smote job with sore boils from the soul of his foot onto his crown and he took him a pot's hood this is a piece of pottery like a piece of clay like a broken piece of a pot to scrape himself up with all and he sat down among the ashes and i want to touch on this here we preach about it then said his wife unto him does thou still retain thine integrity curse god and die but he said unto her thou speak it as one of the foolish women speak it i want to pause there because this captures part of the story i want to look at this in the amplified first to see what the fullness of this verse mean then his wife said to him do you still cling to your integrity and i'm reading the amplified and your faith and trusting god without blaming him curse god and die but he said to her you speak as one of the spiritually foolish woman speaks ignorant and oblivious to god's will that bloom of mine so the foolish we are speaking about here when job says to his wife you speak like a foolish woman it's not the foolishness that lives between simplicity and wisdom you remember when he didn't study in proverbs he's simply foolish and he wise it is not the fool that sits between simplicity and wisdom this is the spiritual fool who speaks with the ignorance of god's will so i was sharing in a room that i was in in a meeting and zooming i said listen it's only one of two cities either god is in control or god is not in control it can't be there's no middle ground for this if we as believers believe god is in control then there is nothing in your power you could do that could change or move or impact what god's will and plan is because god is suffering well if i do this then this would be different and if we could do this this will be different what are you talking about if god listen i know people i i tell my my little daughter when she make up her mind to do something i say but what would ticket to change this girl mind and this is my daughter not two years old yet if she wants something and you distract and give her toy hunting if you have pay attention two hours could pass if you slip up whatever she was going for originally she added for that same thing because it in her heart and i say if it had to change somebody's mind you think if god make up his mind about something you can just come and swing around and do something to upset and change god's mind so job was saying you're spiritual fool because i realize it is a there's a will that's beyond my will it's a purpose and a plan beyond my plan here that's playing out that i'm not in control controller you can't pull me down to that level that's a powerful construct so i want to make sure it's cleared of you speak like a foolish woman it is not full as in moronic or idiotic or lack of knowledge no it is spiritual fool who doesn't realize that there's a bigger plan and purpose and god has something he wants to achieve to show to demonstrate to prove out of these different experiences that we go through can the church say amen definitely a part two still in chapter two what and and and job qualifies what he's talking about he said what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil this word evil here in english in the king james is not the evil we think it is in the amplified it says shall we indeed accept only good from god and not also accept adversity and disaster in other words could it not be possible that god carried me through different journeys to bring out what he wants out of me this is what job is saying to his wife there's nothing in the contractual relationship between god and each of us that says it's a bed of roses we serve at his pleasure his least desire is my command anybody with me tonight are there any christians in the house any believers in the house tonight in all this did not job sin with his lips all right we're moving we're moving we're moving verse 11. now this is where the drama this is the answering in of the whole so chapter one was was stage one this is stage two in this eleventh verse here starts the whole of stage opens the door into stage three which is from like chapter three all the way up to chapter 37. now when job's three friends don't we love having friends anybody enjoys good strong friendships when job's three friends this is where so far so i've been using certain keywords so that we could kind of remember this teaching lost pain betrayal family wealth and health so far we have touched on family we have touched on wealth we have touched on health we have touched on loss we have touched on pain now we get into the betrayal part and the betrayal part takes up almost the largest portion of the study i'm not going to go too deep into it because we don't have time and i'm still trying to see by the grace of god i could finish but here it is jobs three friends we are not allowed to add to the word or take away from the word but if a context i could put two you know those quotation marks around that word friends because by the time you uncover these friends you will wonder what a genuine friend really is now when job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him there came everyone from his own place the temer knight and bildad the shoe height and sofa the nama tight for they had made an appointment together and fellas pick up their phones what's up one another former whatsapp group and say listen job in trouble ollie here olay here the man i boiled house bun dong animal gone through a disaster i never said my life the man was the greatest of all time he was only cover-up forbes now forbes we want to talk to him they made an appointment together to come to mourn with him come and sing the sad story with him and to comfort him and when they lifted up their eyes are far off and knew him not they lifted up their voice and whipped that's a real sound they did they went and seen his had a cry and they ran everyone his mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven so they sat down with him upon the ground no i have to give them credit this is friendship i don't know but mike i know so much friends i have who would do this they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none speak a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very great so i don't doubt the fact that they were friends eh then fellas sit on seven days and seven nights say listen i have nothing to say no i just i just hear with you that is real and sometimes some of us that's what we needed yes sir just to know there's somebody there so chapter two ends with job not being alone his wife is upset with him so she's not in the picture children have gone on we will read i don't even get it but later in the scripture job say he called him 77 here come joe when you read this thing it's too much to get to tonight jose it's so horrible he said man who he wouldn't even put to guard his sheep looking at him for me job is there in isolation joe is there with nobody and he still has these three men these three friends these three brothers these three call it believers however you want to put it who at the very least they are friends enough to sit with job not for 15 minutes well i hear well here let's not go on it i have something else to do i just wanted to pass by and let you know that i heard what happened i come to you know just kind of tarry with you a little bit um you know if you need to call somebody i here for you no this was not that seven days adrian seven nights they sat next to job no words being spoken just to show solidarity with job we here with you that is remarkable that is notable i don't know if this have friends left in this day and age anymore i really i i'm not sure but seven days seven is a long time i didn't want it to sink in in the context so let's move on after this so after the seven day period the conversation starts and between job three and job 37 the entire discourse between job 3 and job 37 for the most part except for the intervention of elohu is this dialogue firstly that starts with jobs for a lack of a better word his frustration being expressed and then each of these three brothers trying to help job see what's wrong with him and job having to respond to what he would perceive their foolishness all right so job so i'm gonna try to take us to a little bit of it because if we take this word by verse we'll be here for the next three months of lockdown um we and to get to these subsidiary closing pathways right so chapter three starts with job so i want you to picture it job is there seven days quiet no talk some of us can sit still for hour some of us can't sit still for a day without opening our mouth god help us some of us to death to our fast food you know fasting and praying like you could do a quiet fascination just stay silent and listen to these still small voice this is not one day two days so after seven days we don't know what is now bubbling in job's mind and heart he's not talking the brother is not talking it's just silence and then joe breaks the silence and job breaks the silence with a burst of frustration that is almost uncharacteristic but you know what i love about this i love the honesty of what i call the human condition and the reality that under pressure under pressure and we see it even in the life of the prophet the prophet reached a point where he said he wished he was dead because depression was too much in fact it was not just a thought he tried to take his life so the reality is situation sometimes can get the better of us and we have to thank god for his grace because in the case of the prophet if god didn't stop the gun is a different story so god had to intervene when we lose sight of the north star or the anchor or the pivot that holds us when we feel sometimes so overwhelmed we may not see a way out anybody with me tonight but all of this in scripture is to give us context and to give us advice and solace and comfort that life is real the struggle is real and lost spin and betrayal is also real so here a few words of job after his seven hours is seven days rather of silence after this job open his mouth and curse his day curses day is not this is like saying he curses birdie i regretta was born and job speak and said let the day perish wherein i was born in other words he said but i wish i was never born yes in other words if i wasn't born i would not have have met my wife and had these children and could lose these children if i wasn't born i wouldn't have a business and open a business and lose the business if i would so job is saying let me do paris when i was born he goes but i can't even earlier than his but he said on the night in which it was said there's a child conceived he said chris the day of conception job is the expression of job is like a poet so his writing is like the height job is at he said forgetting our born curse the day i was conceived let that day be darkness let not god regard it from above in other words wipe that day off the record that is that is not depression oh gosh i'm feeling dumb no he said because the day i was born because i was conceived let not god regard it neither let the light shine upon it let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell upon it let me blatantly terrify it and he goes oh no no no no no no no no no no the whole chapter is about him ranting about wishing things were different i want to sum it up like that just wishing things could be different or wishing there was an undo button you know for those of us who use word and excel and these things we have gotten used to the undo button you make a mistake hit undo and miraculously what you're messed up get fixed back and there's a sigh of relief that you don't have to do over what you did before boy i wish life had an undo button you know much time i wish life had an undo button but god never gave us an undo button decisions have consequences and we have learnt as policy in whatever situation to be able to give thanks and to trust god that all things work together for good anybody with me so we went through one we went through two we will sum up three for simplicity as job's frustration coming out cursing the day he was born but ultimately it's him coming to terms with his it is almost as if the reality of his pain has now set in and it has now taken a grip of what he has lost and the gravity of his pain is real they did say it at the end of chapter two for they saw that his grief was very great he didn't get time to explain it express it so his first expression was as most people would when in reality sits in oh i wish things were different by the time we read job 4 and i'm going to try to browse through many of these things before his brother good brother eliphaz begins to speak he starts off nice he say if we are sata community in other words if we dare to talk with you will you be aggrieved so you're trying to approach it nice you know could we have a word with you but who can withhold and separate speaking behold that has instructed many so he trying to kind of warm up job you who instruct many thou have strengthened the weak hands thy words have upholded them that was fallen though has strengthened the feeble knees but but now it is come upon thee and though fientists so the brothers sign their best to encourage job they say listen you encouraged brendan before you has been the one when people don't you lift them up now look at you tooting it here and you curl up in the fetal position they say come on joe come on joe come on job they said now we come upon the undocumented it touches thee and our trouble is not this that i fear that confidence thy hope and the uprightness of thy ways i know elephants good by the elephants are to slip in something there he say remember i pray whoever perished being innocent in other words as far as i know people who perish something wrong with them you know or where was the righteous cut off so what you go into right now brother brother brother brother brother this thing you're going through verse 8 even as i have seen from my little experience i'm not no big senior minister or anything but from what i have seen they don't plow iniquity and so wickedness really be seen so job tell me is us it's just us brothers here tell me what you did because you had a testimony clearly something happened between the last time i was at the convention and now i've seen you in this condition it is not the whole churches here just us three brothers share with me what you did what went wrong because these things would just happen just so it's a cause and effect what you saw is what you reap this is brother elifa is trying to this is supposed to be so this is where now we're coming with with what i call the betrayal part because we will understand from and it is almost and it is clear because chapter 4 has no knowledge of what chapter one and two has with what is happening between god and satan and god's own declaration about the righteousness of job so these spiritual brothers who quote in scripture because they caught anywhere they are coming from lefino by the blast of god they perish there's a quote and by the breadth of his nostrils they continue i read it then let us bring in scripture and revelation and word i'm thinking of the show job job hear level up now you know if there's unconfession whatever it is if there was ever a service to make it right is this service here right now because if we make it right we could have undo this anybody with me that whole chapter chapter four i'm gonna skip it chapter five all of that was elephants trying to get to the root of job's problem by six jobma was responding to the whole speech from elephants but job answered so this is it so a lot of people who don't study job job is a cadence between the brothers speaking the job and job responding that's the pattern of the unfolding of the book of job the brothers sit there they analyze they speak and then job responds but job answered so he's answering this brother and said oh that my grief was thoroughly weighed in other words you're not weighing it properly and my calamity laid in a balance together for no it would be heavier than the sound of the sea and and he goes on by verse 8 oh that i might have my request and that god would grant me the thing that i long for so job has a desire in his heart he is going beyond the words of elizabeth he's saying all he brought is not understanding job is standing up for his testimony even that it would please god to destroy me that he would let loose his head and cut me off then should i yet have comfort so job is going on and i can't get into all of it tonight but i want it as build and job has this long response then by the time you reach job chapter eight you have bilder other brother no he taken a different approach he listened to elipha's speech he listened to job response and he now seen well i hear elephants i get through so let me try this thing then answered bilal we in job 8 verse 1 then answered bella deshawn and said how long will thou speak these things how long shall the word of their mouth be like a strong wind that god preferred judgment in other words he taken a different approach to get to the same point job there's something wrong with your life you did give this whole response to elephants and you're not coming clean with us you're not being honest with us what is it that's wrong all right so i want to skip through this again because i really want to get to a deeper response job 9 and job answer him and said i know it is sort of the truth but how should a man be just with god if he will contend with him he cannot answer him and job is not responding again to what that brother said all right so i want to skip now now zofa the other brother now then answered zofa this is job 11 verse one we're moving a little quickly now we may have to do another study on this i try but the time the time then answered so far and number ten said should not the multitude of words be answered in other words all them brothers asking a thing and they keep skirting they keep bobbing and they keep weaving and should a man full of talk be justified they say job you're talking and talking but you're not coming clean basically with what is secret sinners and brother brahman preaching they say they keep accusing him of being a secret sinner and that was not the case should thy lies make men hold their peace they are accused of lying and when don't make sure no man made me ashamed for thou has said my doctrine is pure i hope job says my doctor is pure and i am clean in thine eyes but all that god would speak and open his lips against thee he said the call for judgment and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom that are double to that which is no dear for that god exactly less than that iniquity deserved in other words they say the judgment you get is less that you really should be getting you see what about betrayal this is brothers brother thompson come to encourage him you know job 11 verse 6 said no therefore that god they know speaking for god no therefore and when i read i recognize how much people have been talking for god without permission you know they telling job know therefore that god exactly of thee less than that iniquity deserve it in other words what are you going through god should have beat you more he said i punish you more they have no clue that this is god boasting about job you see why it's important to know who given your advice and who encouraging you and who your real friends are could we take a little more because i want to kind of i want to i want to progress here so i want to kind of move on a little bit and then job replied in verse 12 and job answered and said no doubt but he had a people and wisdom job gets so frustrated with him in job 12 verse one and job anthony said no doubt but ye are the people and wisdom will die with you in other words you're saying all you're so wise by type all your god nobody that's all that wisdom meaning already wisest wizard will die with all you only have all the answers all you know what wrong with with me this is this is job in his ash heap not letting him fellas move his feet his position his conviction huh listen to job in verse 3 i am not inferior to you in other words those brothers how they were communicating the job started to make joe begin to push back and say listen don't look at my condition as inferior to you you know i am not inferior to you don't judge me by my circumstances anybody catching this when you see the magnitude of this because god deals with us as individuals this is this is some serious and this message has been plagued with casting fear and judgment by people who have no choice you just speak for god and we'll see how god deals with it by the time you reach the verse 38 it's so and so if you judgment and and and cut off continuity [Music] all the time but this is the context people take authority upon themselves they say well you lose that because you do and so and so and because you leave the inspiration or because i believe anyway he preach it and that kind of foolishness and they have all of the explanation and they put in god in the mix as well and job is forced to respond to each one of these things and every and if we go on and this whole book of job and you need to read it we can have a deeper study of it again and then after that third brother speak the first one time i speak again so by the time we reach joe 15 ellie first take back the microphone again to try a different approach then answered elephants in joke 15 should a wise man utter vain knowledge so and fill his belly with the east wind should he reason with unprofitable talk so they're saying listen we we wasting time here because you again will be saying oh it's speeches where what he can do no good yeah though cast it off fear and restraint and spare before god in other words you operating they telling job you operating like you have no fear because you know something wrong with you this turns on its head things people say to you you know i'm trying to get and i have to skip a lot of these things i might have to call you but i want to really get because i have to touch on elohu but i can't touch it today but i want to kind of can i have to bring this back but i want to get now to to verse 38 because i want to at least bring some clue to this teaching here so between verse or chapter 3 and chapter 37 you have these three brothers going back and forth with the response and then you have elohu who is this mystery young man who comes out of nowhere who comes and when abandoned types him out as a representative of god with a beautiful but adult trying to get in there they want to leave you with his hope out of it here so ella who comes and ministers to job probes job a little bit a little different and then for the first time between chapters 3 and chapter 37 for the first time in chapter 38 god appears all along as this dialogue is going on between job and these friends and these brothers job has some questions coming job would have asked questions such as if i could get to god if i could get clarity if i could get answers i want to know why i want to because job wants to understand he knows there's a bigger purpose but you want to understand and he want god he said i wish i could talk to god i wish god could give me answers that's the theme that was good and many times that's what goes on with us we want god to show us why i want this to resonate one of the biggest challenges we have as believers is trying to get to understand the why of things we want to know why god did it this way or why he didn't do it this way and ultimately what it leads to is a questioning of god so job did not curse god but as this story was unfolding what was happening joe was questioning what was happening to him and if his one lesson i want us to leave with tonight is to not question god because one of his questions was where is god where is god in this situation that was one of job's questions i'm going through this thing and where's god why job cried he said i cried to god and there's no answer we didn't read it but it's there i cry to god but there's no answer where is he why is he not answering me i'm going through loss i go into pain are feeling betrayed the friends who supports from your friends accusing me of things that i know is not true and god somehow seems to be silent anybody with me in the midst of my darkest moment having lost family having lost wealth having lost health having endured loss having lost pain having endured betrayal and looking for answers and asking to find it god give me an explanation tonight help me to understand that was job's condition his state as this whole thing is unfolding he is looking for answers to his questions and then we come to verse 38 and if you have a bible to go there with me job has questions he has answers and god comes down in verse 38 in chapter 38 verse 1 and listen to the response and it's as if god says you have questions let me compare your questions with the questions that i have to deal with so listen to god's response to job's questions then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said in other words let me ask you a question this is god's answer is a question i want this to see that god's answer is a question and his first question deals with those brothers who is this that darken it counsel by words without knowledge this itself is a message to preach the darkening of counsel by words without knowledge in other words those brothers speaking without knowledge he said who is it that darknet counsel without knowledge gird up your lawyers like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me so god comes down and instead of answering joe's job's questions he said listen i come down i'm not here to answer your questions i want you to gird your loins stand up like a man and answer my questions you have questions i have questions too i will answer your questions when you answer mine anybody with me tonight this is the part of the building feet can we go for a few more minutes is that okay all right so job said so god come down so so job come down here you have questions i hear you're wondering about why this happened and and why this happened and your issue with your wife i hear you saying your wife think the thing and your children and your business and the economy and kobe 19 and the thing and the church and things you have all the questions no problem i calm down go to your loins you want a man-to-man conversation let's talk girl you know but before i answer your questions i want you to answer mine and god start to ask questions and what is the questions job 38 in the entire bible from genesis to revelation is the only chapter with so many questions in job 38 i believe has 39 questions and it's god asking everyone god come down to job and say job you had a few questions hear what let me deal with my questions first first question where was though when i lay the foundation of the earth declare if you have understanding when they could answer that question i want to hear to this next one who had laid the measures thereof if don't noise or who had stretched the line you know you're doing construction and you pull a line to measure precisely what you're doing who measure that line before i get to any questions about why your salary didn't come in and why your boss talked to your bad before you deal with those kinds of questions about why your son answer your back and and and and in other words your questions can't compare with the bigger issues of what i am who i am what i'm doing my purpose my objective that the fact that it's not you and your your pity party and your ash heap but the fact is you're talking to me now you're wanting to know where i was in a picture and i want you to answer me where was dawg when i singular personal pronoun lady foundation of the it lady measures thereof stretch the line or who laid the cornerstone and when the morning starts sung together and listen he asked him question and question and job listen job had no response sir i want you to see this verse 8 or who shot up the sea with doors so if you didn't know they see outdoors away no the sea have doors and somebody shot them doors and when it break fought as if it had issued out of the room and when i made a cloud the garment thereof and take darkness a swaddling band for it and break up for it mighty creed place and set bars and hitherto and said hitherto saul though come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be saved god's saying who put the oceans to move the way they move who put the sea to move to where you see anybody with me he asked job has though job is you are you the one in verse 12. has double commanded the morning since the ideas since you born on the earth you come monday morning you make the sun move you want me to answer your questions right when you answer my questions because i i don't think you understand i don't think you understand who talking to you hallelujah i don't think you understand how much of a bigger plan and purpose that i have that you you cannot see anybody with me has god command any morning since the ideas and caused the deep spring to know his place that it might take hold of the ends of the earth and the wicked might be shaken out of it verse 16 has now entered into the springs of the sea verse 19 where is the way where lie dwell it so god hitting job question after question that joke i will start to figure out how to answer anybody with me verse 25 who had divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or the way for the lightning of thunder and what god is doing is showing job job listen your thing you talking about and going through and you're arguing about this and fighting about this hear this i have come down now and i'll let you know that there's a way bigger world than your world there's a bigger plan and purpose than your plan there's a bigger mystery about who you are and who i am and you don't even understand all right let us try to kind of and it goes on i can't get into all of it now we're trying to bring another conclusion here job 40. let's go to job 40 verse 3 is where job has a little response this is the first time from since job 28 that's the first time i believe job even get a word in because god was talking the entire time to him and job it says job three job 40 was she then job answered the lord and said behold i am vile what shall i answer thee job saying i have no answer i will lay my hand upon my mouth lord jesus help me job say i will cover my mouth because i recognize i i shouldn't even be talking once have i spoken but i will not answer yet twice but i will proceed no further job saying listen that's all they gonna do either i'm now recognized but please you know because here's what i want you to get church before this point this is the teaching if you get anything at all get this before this point job thought he had the liberty to question god any way he wanted job i want you to catch us again job thought he had the right the authority the permission the privilege to question god's plans his purpose and what god was doing and god is showing him you cannot question me you i have not given you the authority to question me it is not your place you don't have the rank when you can measure the foundation and close the door on the sea come back to me and ask me why i'm doing what i'm doing around your life i want you to catch that tonight church god spent questionable questions saying when you could pull stars into place when you could do that then you could start to ask me why i do what i do oh god help me tonight that's powerful enough now let's say the brains are closed so when job responded like that verse six then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said in other words god started to to to to to respond to joe based on job's response now then i told him to joke girl up there don't like a man i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me with thou also disall my judgment will thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous in other words would you blame me so that you would look good verse 9 has that one arm like god or cans though thunder with a voice like him in other words god is telling job i hear any hero but i want you to know your place this is powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful people walk around are not understanding is a it's a mighty god and take the liberty to put things in their mouth and speak that they have no right listen let us walk carefully you know this would change while you speak even when they're in your sheep i want you to get this clear because job was in he had a reason to be frustrated he had a reason to be depressed and god was saying even that situation doesn't give you right to say certain things verse 10 deck thyself no with majesty and excellency in other words come up higher the clothes he was wearing yes you went to a loss yes you went through pain yes you went through betrayal but verse 10 deck thyself no with majesty and excellency in other words you could do better than that array thyself with glory and beauty you see why i challenge you lift your head up depression is not your portion frustration not abortion cast abroad the rage of thyroid in other words the anger you have inside about what didn't work out get rid of it you see how god talking to job i'm almost done yeah yeah yeah let's let's close out this this thing so god speaks there and it goes on and i will close out with this last chapter of job and we may go deeper some other time but i still want to get this to drive home his message jobs reply verse job 42 one then job answered the lord and said i know oh god help me that dog can't do everything this was the first time now so what we see here now is the job of 1-1 the upright job had some issues that we didn't see that god was actually working out that was bringing job to a point that he could reach this point so god i preached it before has the ability to operate simultaneously on different levels so while god is boasting about job to the devil god also knows that as upright as job is there are little issues he wants to correct in job's life before dropping too highly of himself anybody anybody with me so here it comes to the point now of job's realization now i know that dog can't do everything and that no thought can be withholding from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore listen listen to this if you want to identify the sin of job because elohu said the same thing it may not be the sin that we consider sin but if to use your words and maybe a strong word but the issue if i could issue with job because i still have to lead the repentance is this here therefore have i uttered that i understood not things to wonderful me for me that which i knew not here i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare that i want to be i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear so job is now acknowledging that his knowledge and his revelation of god was at a certain level i've heard of thee by the hearing of the year but no man i see a deep i know that i see the fullness of who you are know that i understand the gap between your glory and i listen this thing is if you catch this if you catch this it'll make you so careful wherefore look at what it brought job to i abhor myself it is like isaiah in the temple in the presence of god he was saying war they wanted you warned to you and when he came to the presence of god and saw himself in the light of the presence of god and he saw himself he said wait a minute wait a minute where is me job righteous upright job said wherefore i ab myself and repent there's no reason to repent if there's not something to fix or to change or to turn around so here it have job now coming to that point through his experience through his question and god pushing back questions to him job reached that point he said i've heard of thee by the hearing of the air i have utter things i didn't understand i spoke things that i had no understanding i already didn't know i thought i knew but i recognized no i didn't know just like those brothers who spoke they didn't know industrial ashes and we'll close out just reading this and we're done for tonight verse 7 and it was so that after the lord had spoken these words unto job the lord said to eliphaz the temenite first wonderful brother my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends listen why listen to what it is which is why it is so careful friends remember the lord show me to tell you so and so i was reading a quote and a lord sent me to tell him so and so and i feel it's because so-and-so is white so and so you see that kind of foolishness my wrath is kindle against thee and against my two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right in other words you using me convenient to your agenda you have not spoken of me god is saying you haven't spoken of me as a lord the thing that is right as my servant job had so he's saying job came to the roo to say the right things about me this is serious you're saying therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and i love gordon go to my servant job the same one who you say secret sinner go to my sibling job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you oh my for him will i accept in other words if he had prayed for you and not accepting it because i will accept job's prayer all your self-righteousness you trying to job's prayer will i accept is that wonderful oh my god man lest i deal with you after you're folly so god is saying i could deal with you you know but i've given you a chance carry them block something and go and let joe pray here because the alternative to that is i will deal with you after you're falling in other words call in my name and your mouth in a way that i didn't approve is fully and i could deal with you i should be with you i could be with you but because of job your job friend go to him and have him pray for you in that he have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my silver job so verse nine so elephants the temer knight and bildar the shoe height and so far the namatite went and did according as the lord commanded them the lord also accepted job and verse 10 we're closing out here now everybody with me and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends so in other words that itself is powerful job's situation also changed when he prayed for his friends which means he not only had to be reconciled with god but he had to be reconciled with his friends the same ones who betrayed him oh my listen i could leave this here oh my oh hallelujah i don't know if you catch that as much as i catch that because some of us would say when i talked to god and he showed me what it wasn't technically them three worthless brothers if i could just give i could never for these chocolates they tell me when i was dumb no no no his captivity was turned when he prayed for them you can't pray for somebody really pray for somebody if it's not in your heart and god will accept the prayer is not real oh my so verse 10 and the lord turn the captivity of job so job would have overcome his loss job overcame his pain job overcame his betrayal when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before then came there unto him all his brethren and all his sisters and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat bread with him in his house and they bemoan him and comforted him over all the evil that the lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and everyone and earring of gold so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had 14 000 sheep check chapter one six thousand camels checked up to one a thousand yoke of oxen check chapter one a thousand she asses he also had seven sons and three daughters and he called the name of the first jemima and the name of the second kesia and the name of the third karen ha pooch and all the land where would and in all the land where no woman found so fear as the daughters of job and their father gave them inheritance among their bridges after this lived job 140 years and saw his sons and his son's sons even four generations so job died being old and full of these may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word there's so much meat in this that i couldn't get to um but when you have time go into it it blessed me is so much so much so much about the struggle of life you know and it's really a real encouragement to see not just the redemption of what job had but i particularly love the turning away of his captivity when he prayed for his veteran who actually caused even more hurt than the loss of his money his wealth and his family because they made him question his soul they made him question his existence even more you know so i trust friends that as we go through our different challenges our different trials or different testings or different experiences in life inevitably because that's the way god has set it up we have to deal with loss we have to deal with betrayal and we have to deal with pain but the greatest lesson of this is not so much of how or what we go through with it but it's really our response and having the right response and having you right attitude to these things you write words saying you write things and it's tied to what brother preached last sunday because thou has done this thing we have to learn to say the right things we have to learn to do the right things and god will bless us he wants to bless us he loves to bless us can we bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight for lord this encouragement lord lost pain and betrayal a study of job lord title that lord it's it's a paradox in itself how out of this we could be encouraged with feet to see how you worked with your silver and job as a testimony to us even through this time lord when lord there's so much going on lord family friends businesses situations challenges lord where in some way or the other we all deal with loss with pain with betrayal lord our families are affected our wealth is affected our health is affected and lord true at all lord the questions we may find ourselves having or asking or wondering or being concerned about the law to see that lord you still have a plan that is so much bigger than our plan and that your plan would stand and lord it took this whole experience lord for job to come to know you by a genuine experience lord he had not gone through enough to know you the way he knew you lord when it was over lord and there are so many bible characters who had different ends lord but to see job's testimony and how it lived out it's such a blessing to us so we thank you father for lord us being called in such a time as this lord as your children as as your jobs as it were lord that you could choose us and you could boast about us lord because only certain people could be called to stand in this day this day is different not everybody cut out for this but lord you chose who are the ones cut out and lord you are comfortable lord to be able to remove the hedge when you need to lord to prove lord that this word can be proven by believers so may you strengthen your children may you strengthen your sons and your daughters your believers who are so faithful lord may you minister to them may you heal the sickening omits if there's a backslider here tonight may they come to know you may this be an encouragement to your church lord may you bless the pastor the ministry the church the believers the visitors those that may hear the tape may you bless the service tomorrow night the prayer meeting is coming friday the service is coming sunday lord as as we we move into this weekend and lord this father's day is coming sunday may you bless especially the fathers lord in our midst lord and those who perform the roles of fathers lord as we saw joe being lord a good example of a father lord lord maintaining a relationship with his children and being diligent to wake up early to to offer prayer and sacrifice for them because he was concerned for them lord give us that burden give us a burden for prayer burden for one another may you bless your church we committed everyone into your hands in the pressure name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen thank you being a wonderful audience we love you and appreciate you and uh trust we didn't go too late but we at home and um we have nowhere to drive home and i don't know how many people have cool few passes so we have nowhere to go but have a wonderful evening may god richie bless you keep smiling thank god for the victory we are mourning overcomers may the lord reach your message tonight god bless you good night
