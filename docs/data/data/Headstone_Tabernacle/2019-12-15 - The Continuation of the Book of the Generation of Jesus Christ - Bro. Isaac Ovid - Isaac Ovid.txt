this morning you believed anything had happened we do have two notes of praises since the christine want to give tongues and praise to God for his healing touch two days ago she had severe pains in a left arm from shoulder to fingertip and sister Helen call and prayed with her and she can now lift up a hand and all the pain is gone [Music] also from sister Juliet I'm thanking the Lord from saving my son his wife and their baby from getting in a serious accident yesterday a big truck ran on the side of the vehicle and I'm praising God at all as well so we time God for that this morning can we give the Lord a shout of praise the name the babysitter for a few minutes so when I test the temperature here this morning you know it's kind of cool outside and kinda rainy and stuff you know so but we thank God a we could be in the house of God this morning and that the Lord woke us up this morning and we could be entering his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise and we bring a sacrifice of fries into the house of the Lord can the church say Amen it's a sacrifice of praise because it has to cost us something hallelu is a sacrifice of praise because there has to be a course there's a price that must be paid to be able to access his presence so we turn Lord for bringing us into the house of the Lord this morning and certainly at this time I want to salute I don't see her upstairs some but I still want to extend the greeting because I don't want to get into the message without doing it but today but over insist over it celebrate 40 years of marriage to be [Music] to limine office that's a generation that's a generation god bless you richly appreciate our pastor this morning [Music] sister will be no doubt helping get prepared for what has to happen after service today so 40 years later generation leader I get to preach to him Alleluia so we thank God for His grace and His mercy you know and as we come down to the end of 2019 and approach 2020 it is just amazing how God works in a way that many times we cannot understand and he chooses to do it that way because he takes pleasure in doing things outside of our understanding and he will choose to reveal when he wants to reveal his plan he will choose to reveal it to whomever he wants to reveal it to under way he wants to reveal it to so in the meantime our only commitment is to stay on the word that is revealed to us and to stay in his presence to stay in worship stay under expectation and we can't get upset with God if we don't see something yet because when he chooses to reveal it that's only when we can even see it can the church say man so I'm happy this morning to be able to bring a thought to you this morning and as we come to the end of the year and you know sometimes people get so legalistic we we understand that Christ was not born on December 25th we know that that's that's not a degree but at the same time it's a profit many times I come and bring a called the Christmas message a Christmas message you know so I have a little Christmas message to bring to the church from a little different perspective this morning but I felt led and I bring some thoughts encourage you along the way because as I was studying the scripture and reading the wood I I stumble onto something and I started to look at it closer and closer and closer my and it's something that I'm sure we know but when you look at it deeper you recognize the grease of God and the goodness of God and I I saw myself in the story and I say I have to share with somebody so I cooperate over that's a word of it what do you think of this because this thing pulsating in my heart I can't believe God could be so good to me and if you can be so good to me I have to share it with somebody you know and when this gospel becomes a reality to you you know because many times we come to church and somehow or the other a lot of people forget when they've been in church for a while that he came from a messed up situation you know it's almost like if they're one of years you know the Bible or you know the message you kind of forget forget where you came from now we're not talking model try to remember your sins animistic because it's under the sea of forgetfulness but it must be a never that you lose that connection with God's grace towards us because it was never our effort our ability our learning in any way form or fashion for us to be where we are today if it had not been for the Lord we wouldn't even be in the house of God this morning and it's good to be reminded that it was his love that projected it was not our love that projected to bring Jesus on the scene but his love was so great that he saw us at the point of our need when we couldn't do anything about it and his love was bigger than our situation his glove was bigger than our pasta his love was bigger than our mistake and that's the reason we could shout that's the reason we could come to service that's the reason we could access healing because it's not the merit of our pass but it's a feed connected to the love of God and the promises that he has made to us through his word and these promises could never fail because God had never lied and his work could never contradict itself so when God speaks something it has got to come to pass doesn't matter how long it takes that's a matter which way it takes it what road he has to go but it's gonna come to pass can the church say man you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah so I have to do something little different this morning because before I get to the scripture I kind of want to build up to the scripture a little bit if that's okay I wouldn't call it comments before the message but I do want to strike something on the Prophet so I could read the scripture in the context of it can the church say man so if the message the first seal with a random Essene last evening to background it's just a little more we find that when John looked and seen that book still in the hands of the original owner God you remember how it was lost by Adam he forfeited the book of life they need new remanent for the knowledge of Satan and lost his inheritance he lost everything and there was no way for redemption then God made in the likeness of man come down and become a redeemer to us to redeem us and now we find out in these pass these things which was mysterious is to be open up to us in the last days so there has to come a point when it is no longer mysterious and it will open up to us and when it is open up to us it becomes a vision that we could write that is now plain that when we read it we can run which mean go into action can the church say Amen now we find out also in this that are soon as John heard this announcement for the kinsman redeemer to come forth and to make his claims there was no man that to do it no man in heaven no man in it no man beneath it no one was worthy to even look at the book so John was in pain because he knew that if this book was not open up we were in trouble forever John knew that if nobody came and tear the seals of this book and take this book we will be finished think about it a prophet said no person at all worthy to even look upon the book hallelujah can the church say Amen and John just started weeping that's a prophet John just started weeping because he realized that it was finished it was lost because if nobody was worthy to open the book you might as well cry you might as well sigh you might as well give up you might as well throw your hands up in the air he know that there was no chance of redemption then everything was filled and quickly when I ran him said we find his weeping stopping can the church say man because it was announced by one of the four beasts or the elders rather when I don't weep John for the Lion of the tribe of Judah had prevailed in other words overcome and has conquered John turning he saw a lamb coming out here nothing was a lion of the tribe of Judah but the Lion of the tribe of Judah was coming for us alone hallelujah the announcement wasn't calling somebody else it was the same lamb that was the Lion of the tribe of Judah it was the same one that was the Alpha that was OB Omega it was the same one that was the root of David and the offspring of David you don't have to try to figure it out it's just who he is he is bigger than the world he's bigger than the stars he is el-shaddai he is show whole bunch IRA kind of Church Daymond John turned he didn't see a lion he saw a lamb coming out he must have been bloody and cut and wounded it had been slain a lamb that had been seen of course it was chilled bloody but a mess it was still bloody if you had cut the lamb and kill it the way in the lamb was anyhow it was back to pieces on a cross Spears in the side nails in the hands and feet falls over the brow he was in an awful condition and this lamb in an awful condition him Porton went over to him that sat upon the throne that held a complete fatal year of redemption it was not part of the deal it was the complete title deed of retention every redemptive nursing every right that could be activated every government that was given from Abraham or now - now was locked up in that book of retention what God said to Adam about Dominion was locked up in that book of redemption and for the first time since Adam can the church say man that book was good getting back into the hands of a rightful owners can the church say man that held the complete title deed every tension and the Lamb goes that takes the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne and took and open the seals and open the book and then what happened we found out that that there must have been a great something took place in heaven for the elders under for 20 elders and their peace and everything in heaven began a cry worthy worthy worthy worthy here come the interim part of the vials of the prayers of scenes the scenes under the author screamer worthy at the olam for you have redeemed us and now you have made us kings and priests and we shall reign on it oh my that's when he opened that book now listen this is what I want to get to you may be seated and we'll read the scripture you see this book was actually planned this is a prophet and written before the foundation of the world this book this Bible was really written before the foundation of the world and Christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it and what a great thing you may be seated and John when he saw it he said everything in heaven everything underneath it everything heard him saying Amen blessing and honor he just really was having a great time for the lamb was worthy hallelujah amen are you ready for the word this morning can we go to the Bible just one portion of Scripture this morning pray to be a blessing to you see what the Lord will do this morning hallelujah reading from Matthew 1 reading from for this one Matthew one eye reading through this one the book of the generation of Jesus Christ see one more time the book of the generation of Jesus Christ let's see one more time so we're reading the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the Son of David the son of Abraham that verse alone is a message because this is introducing something so matthew is writing and he's right - in a level of authority he is bold enough to declare what you're about to read is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ who is the son of David in case you didn't know who is also the son of Abraham and many times I was sharing with somebody we read Matthew and we glaze over these things but this morning with your help I don't want to glaze over these things and Abraham begat Isaac and I said begat jacob and jacob begat judas and his brethren and judas begat phares and zara of thema and Phares begat Ezra and Ezrin begat aram an Aaron begat aminadab and aminadab begat naasson and naasson begat salmon and salmon begat booz of rachab and booz begat obed of ruth and obed begat Jesse and Jesse begat David the king and David the king begat solomon of hill that had been the wife of urias and solomon begat roboam and roboam begat abia and abia begat asa and asa begat a host just so fathom Josaphat begat joram and joram begat ozias and Osias begat joatham and joatham begat each has an itch has begat ezekias and as he has begat manasses and manasses begat amon and amon begat Josiah's and Josiah's begat jechonias and his brethren about the time they were carried away to Babylon and after they were brought to babylon jechonias begat salathiel and salathiel begat zorobabel and Zerubbabel begot a beard and a BU begot a lot like human alike him begat azor and Enzo begat sadoc and sadoc begat Shem and action begat eliud are you with me and Leu begat eleazar and eleazar begat matthan and matthan begat jacob and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ so all the generations from Abraham to give it up fourteen generations and from people until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found out with child of the Holy Ghost I mean Joseph her husband being a just man I'm not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily and while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David we have not taken to thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived of her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the end of the Lord had pitted him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her first son and he called his name Jesus middle ordered a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated everybody feeling fine where is he going of a title this morning the continuation of the book of the generation of Jesus rice the continuation of the book of the generation of Jesus Christ you know so I was doing some study and I gonna kind of take my time not gonna be too long but I just wanna kind of take my time a little bit this morning and in looking at the scriptures I was having a conversation I was saying you know when you read Matthew Mark Luke and John it's really four different perspectives of the same scenario so it's as if something happens on the road and one person is driving by and saying was a blue car that I saw and somebody else drives by and said there were two people in the car and somebody else drives by and says he was driving on the wrong side of the road and then somebody else sees something else there's a policeman flag them down so if you take one piece of the story a policeman flag them down that's all you have but when you bring it all together you get a blue car driving on the wrong side a road with two participants I got flag down because the policeman saw them can the church say men you get the whole story so God in His grace allowed Matthew Mark Luke and John to capture different perspectives of the scenario that took place in that day so that when you read the scriptures there should be no contradiction it should all be the same thing because God is not the author of confusion everything must make sense everything must line up it may take time for your understanding to be open about what it is but it is the Word of God speaking to us so we can connect to what things are can the church say man so as I was reading Matthew wanted I was gonna see whether the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the Son of David the son of Abraham a while back I preached a message about David a man after God's own hands and it really struck me when I was preaching about David and how David was being built up and he was a young boy and no doubt everyone is born in sin and shaped iniquity and and you see the hand of God upon David you see him with the lion and the bear you see him with good light and you see all of this you see David conquer Goliath you see David rise up among his people you see him being the king that was named king and the king didn't even know there was a new king that's how much God loved David to seek God is the only one who could fire you and have your replacement right there waiting for you when Saul is sitting on the throne the holy the Bible said there's a spirit of God left him and the Spirit of God came back into the palace when David came back with a heart the shooter quarter was already anointing T but can the church seaman and I was thinking about the story I see when Jesus came because Jesus came in four names son of God son of man son of David and also son of Abraham can the church say Amen we don't speak too much of a son of Abraham but he is son of Abraham we spent a lot of time son of man son of God son of David but your son of Abraham but Abraham said it four names can I just say man so when I saw sit how could Almighty God choose to have Jesus be comfortable to see son of David when David really messed up as you study as he David went after a man's wife orchestrated and her husband to the front line to fight deliberately it wasn't an accidental positioning he said put a smile in the front line knowing that the first line goes and I seen but God looked at this man quality of it as it is the man after my own heart and God overlooked his failures God overlooked his mistakes and sent out of your generation Stephen will be all the kings and I said God is so different from our thinking because we could be so judgmental that went somebody make a mistake we don't want to associate with them we were to repair that we do even know them we want to write him up but God is nothing the business I realize the writin of anybody I can't find it in Scripture I've got writing off anybody so it blew my mind when I just looked at test David's relationship to Christ and what pleased he was to be son of David can the church say Amen and then when you read Matthew you start to discover something very interesting can you go with me a bit this morning we're going to preach a bit in a while now when you look to scripture genealogies generational messaging in Scripture almost always excludes females it's always the male that I mentioned so when a female is mentioned it is significant can the church say Amen so I try to understand because I'm looking at my walk I'm looking at our walk and many times you say no but boy I really messed up I made a mistake I don't know how and many time the devil come to us with what you did last week what did it last year what family you come from what your parents may have done what your grandfather may have done and all this and bring up bring all this negativity to us it's only self righteous people can relate to this and I said to read Matthew and I realize that in Matthew references firewoman so to be mentioned firstly energy genealogical record a generation record is significant but this one is different this is not any record we're talking about this is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ now this is Matthew but a kindly who is writing this is Matthew the accountant this is Matthew the record keeper Matthew had the option of leaving stuff out if you wanted to but the fact that he left certain things in here means that we supposed to take note of what he had in here 10 the church amen hallelujah if it was not important it would not be here but when the Branham taught us if you don't if you read the Bible and don't see Jesus in every verse of scripture you need to read it again because every word here is important every scripture is given for a purpose so no scripture as as simple as it may be is just yet to take up space quato have time to put his word in book form but to take up space so we want to find out this morning what lesson God wants us to learn from this that no matter what mistake you have made no matter what Paul you may have fallen there is redemption for you because this book of the generation of Jesus Christ is a book of the story of retention how God to take broken pieces and put it back together again how God was applying blood before the world even began he was already slain to make a way for these people to make it because if he didn't do it they wouldn't stand a chance and if he didn't do it you wouldn't stand a chance and if you didn't do it I wasn't send a chance and the church team and everybody feeling fine can the church say man [Music] so as you read the scripture Abraham begat Isaac we notice so the first part of the whole of Matthew's about the patriarchs we know it Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he's going on and Judah and then we find the first female as mentioned it's five along we know them right Thema is the first everybody with me we have Rahab we have Ruth we have Bathsheba and then we have Mary and God chose to use these five women with some real interesting stories now when you think about it some of you wonder Lord why put me this family why you put me in this country why didn't hammer grew up under a nice little house and nobody to I'm to think that Jesus had he had a choice he could have choose to be in the home of somebody who always went to church every morning at 9:00 a.m. and they never miss church and he could he had a choice I want you to get this we didn't have a choice what family we were born in but he write the book before it even happened so he had a choice and he choose to confirm him minds of your eyes with how he choose to even come I think I wanna say that one more time then you have a choice with who your father was did you have a choice who your grandfather was so if your grandfather was the highway robber who brick did you up you couldn't do anything about it this was just the hand that you were dealt but Jesus was different before Adam was even on the earth he knew Joseph and Mary was going to be the house that he wanted a crop in he picked the house in advance hundreds of years before even Kim he picked the house because he had to eat food somebody had to wipe the die upon somebody up to take in the Sunday School somebody and he say you know what I find how nice was the name Joseph adjustment I find a nice little lady named Mary a nice little woman gonna use them so when you see the mind of God this is where people get confused because when I'm really preaching about is predestination predestination because only predestination can lead us to be here this morning we didn't choose this walk this walk chose us hallelujah Mary didn't choose her walk this walk chose Mary saw citizen choose this walk this walk chose Joseph David didn't choose this walk this walk chose David Abraham didn't choose this walk Eva I didn't know that when he was born and he was growing up that from him what's gonna come the king of kings and the Lord of lords David didn't know we and he was tearing the line and the beer come on somebody preach back to me I want to encourage you this morning and you are here today and you don't even know what you are born to do what's locked up inside of you what's already written in the book it's already written because he's the author and the finisher hallelujah your story has been written it's not now being written it has been written and the church him and you receiving the Holy Ghost already written your family delivered already written hallelujah every mistake you made was already written and God put blood blood blood so when we read it you'll be justified as if you never did it in the first place when we read it you are sanctified Joseph or nuit called does he call it justified does it justify me already it's past tense it's already written what can we tell say to these things if God before us tell me who can be against us the devil cannot hold your pass over you that ever pallid holy mistakes over you God already wrote it and he put blood in it can the church semen you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the church hey man he could have put you in a pooty pooty house but he chose to put you in the house you were in because that's what he wanted so he could prove that he's someone who raised you he could prove he's someone who fed you he could prove he's the one who delivered you that's the way he would even be seated for a minute I don't know where but can the church see man so it's a power of choice certain choices God keeps for himself certain choices he gives to us he didn't give us a choice to choose our reach he didn't give us a choice to choose our height he didn't give us a choice to choose our genetic structure but he gave us a choice to worship he gave us a choice to praise Him he gave us a choice see hallelujah anyhow don't let don't ever keep me down that's what I have control over this morning somebody help me please just morning [Applause] [Music] hallelujah you may be seated the sooner you learn that there's a difference between what you can control and what you cannot control all your worries stops most of the things you worry about and stuff you cannot control come on you cannot control your children why worry about them turn them over to the Lord he can take care of them can the church say Amen [Music] hallelujah you may be seated most of the stuff you stress about you cannot control you they are stuck in traffic and you stressed out you can control it you move in you have to separate what you can control from what can be and cannot be controlled you have to separate what God has written about you and the choices you have because he doesn't choose for you it's your choice but his foreknowledge saw your choice before you even here and that's how we can creat destined 8-u these unfor what every day we have choices every day we have decisions to make can the church seaman Abraham had a choice when God said walk before me and be thou perfect he had a choice when God said to him come out of your people into a place I'm gonna shoot come on now somebody preach back to me I'm Abraham left cheek in a city whose builder and maker was God whenever I'm left he thought he would find that he didn't know will sell me wait till for that city what he talking fine that city somebody peeps flat to me this morning you may be seated so court shows how he would come and that's one of the reasons why we've seen later on the Pharisees and me had such a problem with him because he wasn't born in the priesthood he wasn't he wasn't born that's why John the Baptist was such an anomaly you saw those names Salah TL Abby you'd suru barbell Zadok L you'd ELISA Martin and Rehab John all them multi-syllable names then they have just John Doe fight someone crying there whether it's who recruited him who ordained him who choose him whose school he went to who here is up under whose ministry was he grew manna whose ministry what was his pedigree what is his generation because people listening to John and I don't know what church she was in before he started his church got me this morning but that's how God operates he chooses to confound the wise those who think they would know another theologian said when Matthew was writing he wrote in such a way to stick the Jews a little bit so that when they finally accepted Jesus's they recognized early story wasn't really you know there was some there's some stuff in his story and it's self-righteousness you when the carrier server round they're stuck listen is there anybody here who have stuff in yours we can just look over the people for me and see if there's anybody who doesn't have a story this is my story this is my song praising my Savior all the day long so as I was looking at a simple wait a minute not only did God choose how he wanted to come and the line he wants you to come true but he didn't even hide it that is he pawed by the gorge that blew my mind really were anything about it because listen to how it's written everybody with me the Sunday school this morning I know is that he normal Christmas kinda messy after forgive me what is he little measure there go give me right so Abraham begat Isaac everybody at least no depart Isaac begat Jacob who we know his name became Israel and Jacob but I said begat Judas and his Gretchen and listen or descriptor Ruiz and Judas begat Phares and Zara and I could have left it right there you know and then you could go on and far as we got as wrong but I thought about read it said and you will be Godfather Sarah often mom so I say but but if it was me now if I tell you right and this is when people are playing for a job and it right here to rescue me people that's right watch none when your readers are many many people who write it you want really talk about a cellphone I have yet to find somebody who put these stop there do wrong in the resume nobody else tell you you know like everybody couldn't anybody good in Microsoft Office everybody I have to find somebody who has openly admitted and not being good in Microsoft Office everybody good in would in Excel and PowerPoint so no you don't you know what we do now we said I'll create your good good yeah but our do an Excel spreadsheet with pivot tables women do you really could only say well I am not that good there are those who don't know and they say well let me start and invariably after one hour you like I really get too far but nobody puts stuff in their story that would meet this story look cheeky but here we find Matt you not covering up you know anyway - but cover up and there's no conspiracy this what I love about God is transparent you know that's why the Bible said confess your faults one to another I understand iron because his listen is redemption we talking about and Judas begat Phares and Zara of tema so I don't want to go too deep into your mind because Timmons were no stories they have these these acronyms they work now not suitable for work dear my story not not not not right here but his short version of tema Judah had three sons this is Israel and Judah had reasons the first son maritima the Bible said he was so horrible to that girl God killer under the law when a woman's husband dies her brother his brother supposed to marry her so Judah's second son is obligated to marítima and he marries her the baby said he was so horrible to her to kill him - so Judah lose his two sons today's woman caught him on the third son is too young to marry so Judah tells tear my tema when he grew up he were married but he Bible said in two days hot he said not this last boy this woman none taken were two first sons already let me hide this boy so the Bible said Judas cemetery every other widows who could never find out the self and not and if ever said eventually after some time passed he might gets word that the youngest son is now of age but she has got no phone call she again oh what's up she again no text message Julia come on check out these young bro yeah come on check ups you say about already going on here do not give me his word that's when this young boy grows up no this is a story that's already started a girl shaky right so the Bible said that tear my hood hood that Judah was coming into the area she was in there the Bible says she dressed herself as a prostitute and deceived Judah and out of that union came twins one of them is called fairies and that boy born out of that messed up situation is named in the lineage that led to Jesus now it would have been easier for Matthew to guess a and Israel begat true durand-ruel a bigger fire Ambrose nobody whole thing but God is showing there people with messed up stories and even in because the Bible said Judah when he found her what she had did he said she's more righteous than I am because she was seeking justice based on the promise he had made to her to give her a lesson why didn't go and hide the story so we have the first one tima the one who pretended to be a prostitute then we all know the story of Rahab she was a prostitute children of Israel trying to go into Jericho send spies over to surprised and looking for them and when you read it you see most people reading scriptures when vitami solders cannot speculate that it has to visit us there ray about time hiding many back the Bible said under the cover of the roof in the house I heard somebody said I was the first undercover agents they were literally undercover and when they went to rehab rehab say they'd already gone if you run now you might still catch them and rehab because of her profession already got word from all the passers-by about what happened to the Red Sea what happened he'll asking what happened so by the time that man reached her house she said Anna I hear all these stories your anger and wind all I was remember me remember me she didn't actually tension she didn't actress Alsatian yes I remember me she didn't know how it's gonna work out but I can see this story is a story of redemption and one of those men was anointed he give her a call is he hung this cold outside of your window it's a red cord it's a sign of blood cord this is like what we did when he was in Egypt oh come on summary preach back to me [Music] you may be seated and rehabs house she bring up I was the only thing that was left standing in Jericho embarrass it was a general in Joshua army when to this history had brother you know who she is I don't mean to true your affair but you know you don't have past I don't mean it love to you a word to the wise is sufficient do not enter interesting on advice but in Spanish name was Salman something was inside my heart that he couldn't explain but he didn't know his story was already written because he didn't know that he was bad because he along with her Ahab was gonna have a son whose name was Boaz [Music] can the chance amen and as you go on here this is the dominant generation of Jesus if worker finds you it messed up stories and put the pieces together and use them oh god he can take my messed up story and put my pieces together are you gonna use meet you [Music] [Applause] you may be seated I'm gonna story about roots and Buddy mime type so truth I've only could see it but I just is kind of having a conversation this morning I've already quotes a check but nobody kinsman-redeemer all of this stuff and rutan de nexus to offer and Naomi I me or me say what I have to call because you know come out with people I know if I say well all right good one I would say wherever you go I go where you Lodge where you die I die she didn't even know how steep but she was walking in a story that was already written he was a character in the story walking towards a destination because she was part of the lineage of the generation of Jesus Christ no you were sitting for a minute I have polished up to here but she's a Moabite she's an idol worshiper and there's a scripture that says no more bites supposed to go into the temple for up to ten generations and God pull up more bite into the story and brother branham said so when you trace the lineage of Jesus he is part to project I'll out of the relationship between pause and reach God wolf that Gentiles into the lineage of Jesus truth so he could be a kinsman redeemer support you and Gentiles to the bond and the free to the lame and the shake somebody please back to me [Music] hallelujah anybody feeling fine so-called walk the chain that into the story God knew how to do it how to move the pieces together to ensure that his law can never be broken that nobody could see he wasn't qualified that he couldn't do it kinda just a man no scripture contradict itself and now we move onto a DVD DVD king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of urias we know the story about sheba and although order livid Wahoo's etc go choose the adulterous relationship the messed-up story - premiered emption not that he was supporting it or endorsing it but he was bringing Redemption because when man fell that curse of sin was true all all man so there was no perfect person to use the message of perfection could only be preached after Jesus comes because he was the only perfect one so God had no choice but to use imperfection to bring for perfection let me say one more time God had no choice but to use imperfection to bring what perfection but when that which is perfect is come that opens the door for perfection to be manifested in sons and daughters of God [Music] you may be seated [Music] can the church say man anybody feeling fine so if you think you have a story you know but around you see if my father was a drunkard he's not cookies and then there's a coda how many say he said I am NOT the son he connect back to his original heritage he can say I'm a son of Abraham I'm a son of David and the church same but a brand connected to the continuation of the generation of Jesus Christ listen when you read after cheek when we will get it I'm getting excited but God is so good and I love time to do full justice to this but if you want to touch on one name it's not a female because we are dominant females until we get back to Mary but after a brought to babylon jechonias begat salathiel that jeconiah you talking about there's a scripture says out of jacanas loins will never come at him out of jail or never coming so how does God reconcile at instructure because if out of Jeconiah strawberry cliff could be a king then people could clean joseph was really Jesus father but Joseph was Jesus legal father he was in his biological father but he was at the house of David which was the house that Jesus had to be born in can the church say Amen so God had to cut the roots somewhere and I love the legal authority to pass through can the church salmon so that nobody could come and suggest that's why when Jesus entered to say since tina's cook yes fulfill it is not this Joseph's son they trying to connect him biologically to choose it but there was no biological connection he was illegal Guardian that was the man to train jesus any any early thing they hire walk don't put your foot there somebody had to do it you know all I think he wanted to work on is a man that was Joseph can the church say Amen and then we come down to marry the fifth woman and fives a number of Greece we know it creates a lot Exodus woman he America was highly favored power mama woman from the beginning of time to now there's nobody like you because this was written before you were even here before your grandfather was here no your great-grandfather was here this was written [Music] I've come to give you a message you're gonna have a chat this name would be wonderful is name will become Salah his name will be manual Adam has been waited for this child no one has been waiting for this chat Iran waited with this check can the church salmon and God like Allah see when you look at this passage of Scripture and I really want to encourage you with this he could have choose a nice and family innocent way but he still had Jesus born under mysterious circumstances because Joseph when he see this ad to say I see this I don't want to make a public example that would've ever said so I put away quietly Joseph we marry we cook it over something else he didn't want to make it a public story about what happened with Mary but he thought to come and comfort him tell em don't worry because one is in this woman it's up the Holy Ghost and that was comfort to Joseph but no doubt people have been talking because humanity to talk that's the only reason that Joseph would have been thinking about putting our way because I didn't want to be with he talk but God loves to take messed up stories and Mac and make beautiful stories out of it come the church see men but friends his story didn't stop there it is just that Matthew was only allowed to write up until this point but this book this book that we introduced before the scripture so if Matthew was allowed to write further than his age and he was all to see further than his time but George your name was vomit well Angie Johnny was gonna be there but Terry only was gonna be there but we only man you had to see him and he said had to see you but I hated to see you name anyone he's not a literal name but the mystery of who you are because he's talking about us the continuation of this book of this generation of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say man Oh hallelujah hallelu could he take someone so that was the core fan should actually want to drop some course and then we could close out because I want to pull some stuff from what the prophets said if that's okay with you so this all of these friends is the great mystery of God that God could do things in such a way that the world can miss it sent a prophet in a way that the world overlooked it send preachers and messengers and churches because the attention is not on us it's on him it's really his story didn't say the book of the generation of Abraham or David it's of Jesus Christ where the branch said he is a central team of the Bible it was him in the Psalms it was him in all the books it is always been about Jesus and in this day and time he's looking to no close be in the closing pages of this book hallelujah and that is why John was weeping because it's only that book being restored gives us access to come back into our position like Adam had before and I'm lost it can the church Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I just want to read from the prophet a few quotes gauze wrapped gift now you see he's on what rehab this Hallett was a Gentile and she was a ancient grandmother tall Lord Jesus that's a prophet with now for those of you wanna know where I get it from right also when PO s her grandson comfort and married ruth the moabite he also married a Gentile which made jesus also pat Gentiles at least speakin prophets worse now then when they brought their child for his name was open and open had a son and his name was Jesse and Jesse had a son whose name was David all this taking place in little Bethlehem what is it the lineage of the Lord Jesus his background at the great spiritual men were overlooking or the so-called spiritual men hallelujah see and prevent him now in the memories the message Revelation chapter 5 he said see lifted above the shadows out of the grind of 40's we have earnest now of our complete inheritance because Jesus had to come for us to access the inheritance without Jesus coming there was no inheritance so every person along this dist story he said it was fourteen generations and another fourteen generations and along this every time is a step closer or God seen inheritance once inheritance inheritance because only when Jesus came he said it's almost upon us now we can talk about inheritance now we can talk about power listen we have the earnest now of our complete inheritance because Gor has already pulled loose the ground roots from the things a bit and I supplanted us on higher groundz lifted me out transept me transform me from the things of the world took out roots branches everything and lifted me up out automatically out of the old muck of sin and planted me on top of Zions Hill setting in the orchard of the beloved scenes of God listen to the Prophet he is speaking present tense based on Revelation and now we are citizen to that Kingdom brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus all filled and calm and nastiness caught from our minds our water bodies are washed with pure water and our hearts are sprinkled by the blood of the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit is abiding with his breeze blowing through our branches all day long shoving us and pushing us and making us take good roots and agro County isn't that wonderful the earnest of our salvation and the church amen wait I'll go but Isaac I'm talking with the continuation of this generation of the Lord Jesus Christ in other words when Jesus left but a pop world and the devil hood it is finished he taught this whole thing finally closed he didn't next didn't know what to expect because what Jesus did next had never happened before before Jesus everybody else waited in the ground and stayed there Jesus went and bungs back out [Music] [Applause] and when Jesus bunks back out he said because I live you gonna live also when Jesus comes back out he ushered in a whole new dispensation hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah so this morning you could bounce back out because it's in you to bounce back out it's in you to rise up it's in you to shake things off and the church came in and he said if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you that's what'll quicken this mortal body it'll make you shout it'll make you tense it'll make you sing it'll make you go to the rapture hallelujah when Iran said our lost inheritance our loss inheritance has been reclaimed by our gracious precious kinsman redeemer how God came down changed his cast from God and was made man he said God change the level he was at it changed to became man in order to be human to become a human kinsman redeemer the redeemed black and natural worlds and natural people how that God the supernatural became natural let me say that again how God the supernatural became natural and God is about to take natural and turn him into supernatural and the church demon how God the supernatural isn't a prophet became natural to become a kinsman because he could not defy his own laws he had to come by kinsman redeemer ship because that was his plan that's the way he did it God has an order and gotta break his order God as a process and he cannot break his process [Music] come to church hey man could we take some more everybody with me this morning could you take some more hallelujah we are walking in our story this morning we are walking our pathway this morning the steps of the righteous are ordered by God because a story is already written we are walking in the light this morning he is the light that's like we are walking in we are not going to go into darkness we're not going to go into men's ideas our feelings our emotions our past but we're going forward all the way to the rapture all the way to the resurrection and underway to the rapture we pick up our family on the way to the resurrection we pick up our healing on the journey we will pick it up if you lost your toe we pick that up too you lost your piece we pay that up too you lost the revival we pick that up too everything is in our inheritance and Jesus tried to give us access access to the inheritance it's our inheritance it's alway inheritance it's access we are looking for and this morning as sons and daughters of the Living God we have access we are of the generation of Abraham we are of the generation of David we are royal sheets that's why we could be called kings and priests [Music] hallelujah hallelujah everybody should be something nothing to be weighing you down hallelujah nothing should be weighing you down your past cannot weigh you down your sin can and wear you down your sickness cannot weigh you down because sickness is a product of sin if there was no sin there'd be no sickness if there's no sin there be no doubt if there was no sin there be no fear if there was no sin it'd be no depression if there was no sin it be no frustration it because I've seen unbelief that these are byproducts byproducts of sin byproducts of unbelief but when Jesus came he broke the power of sin forever not temporarily he destroyed the whole that simcha never however on the blood wash once up so when we come into his presence and there's blood being creature weak to the watering of the word and you say Lord I am here Here I am send me when God looks at you he does even see what you did yesterday he doesn't see your mistakes it's just blood and that blood still has a bump off giving you access given you access put the plank up in the sky Oh hallelujah hallelujah giving you access to the bank up in the sky halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah hallelujah Oh glory God I'm continuing now critic someone I just warming up in her don't worry we have food after service so we could we could cruise a little bit this morning we got going to cruise control God knowing that man would fall it was no surprise to him your mistake was never a surprise to him is that of course what Pope will do of course what George - oh god yes nothing to surprise God God knowing that man would fall God knowing that man would be lost though he did not want anybody lost but to order the greatest name of the attributes of God in order for it to be displayed had to be manifested that he could be a redeemer he could be a senior man had to fall how do you got me or not you didn't have a choice good hard to let you fall he didn't make you do it but you watch you do it because he wanted to be your oedema you wanted to be your Savior [Music] now you see why I'm so happy now you see why I'm so glad it has been written about me we are also written epistles get excited friends your journey but this D God saw everything take place there's never been a surprise there's never been a surprise my mine you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah no Scripture could contradict itself but a Branham dramatized one time you see when them Hebrew boys were put in a fiery furnace doors angels they don't have the knowledge of God he don't have the insight of God so when they saw this but a party they ran into the throne room one would see lots and me I would go take care of it keep pressing send me but God is not surprised each other say I will go myself it has always been my plan to go myself I don't like sending the representatives when I can't go myself hallelujah somebody please black to me then Hebrew boys he had a choice they had a choice they could have gone back home they gonna see we changed our minds we apologized but you see listen if God or deliver us we shall not bowing down this gospel to could this word to sweet do you've known him too nice I'm not willing to give this up for money for woman for popularity to be in the in-crowd with whatever move and they walk in pulley and the Bible says when they're cut in there there was a fourth man in the fire he was with the call himself a man but it wasn't man he was God he was the god man the supernatural and he was walking in the midst of this fire you may be seated listen listen dear names Shadrach Meshach and Abednego were not mentioned in that chronology we just read but they are in the story enough oh you don't hear me oh no you didn't hear me listen what about Joshua isn't his name day but when Jesus was winning his generation he's connected there too you know why everybody could trace back to spiritual sons of Abraham that's how about Abraham thought it so it is jesus the son of Abraham the son of David the son of David is a royal and the son of Abraham is the covenanted line but this gentile dispensation is royalty or you don't hear me this morning because when the viewers read from top to bottom it was a lower divine act yes we automatically became priests and kings it should have been only the Levites had access but God made can't I be the Levite [Applause] [Music] hallelujah you may be seated anyone in the house this morning come on you're Levites come on you royal seeds of David you royal sons of Abraham spiritual seeds you may be seated no one under left listen listen the ending of a story it's always the best possible listen listen you could miss the beginning but don't miss the ending it's real stress if you seen a good movie I'm you seen 92% and it died frustration but you know you can miss the first 20% and get to figure out who the bad man is and who he could manage but you want to mix it with a really led story you see the bad man on the ground and he couldn't man photography neck that's how this story is about to end except that in this story you watching this story in real time but you also in this story it's a real kind of mystery how you can be out of this story and in this story at the same time because I'm preaching about what you're about to do and one of these days you'll see yourself doing it I'm preaching about you receiving the Holy Ghost and one day you're gonna get the Holy Ghost I'm preaching about your family coming back and one day you wanna bring them back [Music] somebody say man and the circuit a lot of shadow praise you are the continuation of the book of the generation of Jesus Christ listen friends you may be seated but a man who preached what accounts he said when Christ died we died with him he said when he rose again we rose with him so on the elevator thinking we're not reading a story we are reading our story we were there we were there we were represented there the continuation of the book of the generation of Jesus Christ hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is my story when I ran I went so far let's say we were there here let me get Lucifer out so we are all that I'm Lucifer that went over some heads this morning attribute sons of God were there before God created so before Lucifer was created the attributes were already in existence I am older than the devil I am all over the Angels it is if you could see who you are recognize who you are and the power I have seniority seniority over demons seniority over spirits before the world I was because I'm part of God himself I'm an attribute son of God when he was thinking about everything we were there we were there that's why we can say we come from God and we go back to God [Applause] hallelujah you maybe she did different kind of Christmas message right this is not about ninja this is not about a manger this is not about no no that's wonderful but this Jesus he was not a baby all the time as a baby they tried to get him but as you get older and I get more mature he becomes a common to his own and by the time he reaches ministry the devil had not seen anything like it and we have started off as babies not knowing much googoogaga but poor see how long will you drink milk when but always here last week when is good seven course meal lead out for us port in the spiritual and in the natural after service we have seven course meal kind of service hallelujah that we can live and fight a bubble child above all situations situation will come and let them come we are built to handle it let the problems come you can handle it we can handle it that's what we've been built for what we've been born for what we've been designed for what we've been constructed for what we can handle David couldn't handle what we could do Elisha could not do this is the hour for the manifestation of the sons of God [Applause] you may be seated halleluja halleluja the continuation of the book of the generation of Jesus Christ you may be seated [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] can you take someone if you played a game of chess there are different pieces that have different purposes the pawns our soldiers you can't be foolish as a chess player and say I don't want points because I have a bishop and I have a castle the castle and Bishop more powerful and pawns are don't need a porn because I have the bishop if you don't use your pawns effectively you will never survive to be able to engage a bishop or in the a castle but anybody knows who the most powerful piece on the borders the most powerful piece on the border any chess player knows the queen but the authority of the Queen really comes from the king because if there is no king the queen has nothing we queen of I'm a queen I'm a queen I'm at the oakwoods sticker selfie hashtag queen but because the king is on the board because if the King Falls everybody including the Queen finish DM done but the power to move without hesitation from end to end in any kind of way is the Queen everybody with me so in this great strategy because Cora's our strategist if you remember Ten Commandments when Rama seesaw it openly Red Sea and then you say their gore is a poor general he leaves them no retreat it looked like he had I'm listing all good because Rama season understand the power of this guy so core is a strategist but it's only in this age he looked at TV a special kind of ministry called Bryan wife queen these are so many things that could call her because when Jesus was he was leaving part of a ministry for her to finish not that he can't do it but he put enough power in her to finish what he started knowing that he - I won and when she speaks it's born of my born flesh of my flesh spirit of my spirit and it's dropping Wilkie's so you know so any devil come I said I tap you up and then you see you know who I am because this age I said if I hold ministry is is a purpose focused ministry until we all come when that until until means of the time element until kind of eternal check it in English any language dictionary so the fibermesh is temporary but it's brighting is eternalism and this covenant because we're a man said you ring of predestination the ngage recalling engagement ring was put on before the phone is anywhere so you walking around brother Alexis with an engagement ring of corporate destination which means you are guaranteed access to not just walk up the aisle you buy another bridesmaid you walk enough as bride walking up anybody with me this morning I'm gonna try to wrap up somewhere part time with him block any time when I ready hallelujah so let me try to find a place to toast everybody feeling fine you know but a man said when the bride gets to know who she is then the rapture will go you know it's just waiting for us one day your mind just open up know because listen I don't know how it is for you why just given you my testimony but my ex but when I read much you want I see a pot Lord I have a chance because the enemy would make it think you can make it to the Royal Gorge every time the enemy can tell it you give up you know make it you make this mistake this is going wrong I see but if God could use tear my I go to use root and quarter usually have a quarter music and quad or change so when Corps decide to find a messenger for the Gentiles he went on look who I could find boy I'm and Jessica Stephen yes daddy one because I'm looking to confuse the devil God is not the author of confusion but he like to confuse the devil he liked to use unexpected people in unexpected ways to an unexpected end can the church demon so here comes brother Paul who was once all you know very very very wet Bible and brothers had a fight with Wiley he come into it a normal long when I greet your brother I take my brother's greeting but was no heartbeat no no it wasn't like really from the heart it was really struggling because they were still remembering Steven precious deacons even and listen Polly is only when you go through that together you you can assign a negotiation or they know what's think we should do creature how signatures help out and this brother here who wasn't even with Jesus you call a home with him and Peter he withstood Peter to his face who is you and that's how easy it is to see that's and this was a lovely serenity of God where I can't judge anybody it's not in our ability to judge because God could choose to appoint who he wants to appoint and by the time we read Peters last script which you read couple sirs ago he said as was spoken of brother Paul beloved brother to make them know listen don't get it twisted we have no beef between us but the revelation has been given to my brother Paul who has said things that are hard to understand even me struggling to understand because they couldn't see eye to eye with any revelation was given to Paul for the gentle disposition was not given to Peter keys are given to Pizza Hut pizza readily understand it so don't get upset with me by the measure of my revelation God choose a review to whomever you will more about him and that's why when this prophet Malachi fought him as when a Terran said some time ago people were administering a platform thinking this was just another brother sharing would but the measure of Revelation doesn't give in to this Elisha prophet was way beyond their pay grade and he was so low pay they couldn't even understand what was being ministered to them on that category of wood but that's how God loves a man who didn't go to geology go school because I was eating led yeah to a Bible School you have to what minute she grew up under and go and raise up a prophet could barely speak no great education and choose that profit to be part of the story of the continuation of the book of the generation of Jesus Christ in so much that the Son of Man was filled in is the show that the generation was still continuing and he was still calling more sons because that book of the generation described by the populace really this book of redemption it's a book of names of them that is what was being fought for it was a book of names and The Associated inheritance that was tied to these names but if Adam called it book many things the book of inheritance the book of redemption a book a name is the same book it's the individuals in the book and the blessings that are so see where these individuals and Adam was supposed to call these names and they were supposed to have the same thing they seemed to mingle and Adam had can the church say Amen oh let me try to find a way to close out my time is up oh I live in our Peter each let us skip to my mother I said good sub to redeem what not notice it was a lamb ratima a lamb redeemer just like the face God can never change the first Redeemer was a lamb in the garden he was a lamb Bakura fan here it was again plumber open revelation it's again a lamb to redeem what the Fallen condition and the fallen inheritance of a fallen race of people a lamb comes back to a team like ours was at the beginning to redeem us to redeem what he's going to redeem anything that his team is going back someone has been lost if someone has been lost and then it's been brought back again what did we have at the beginning eternal life we was heirs of the world we had life we never had to die we never had to be sick we never had to get old we never had any worries where there's no funeral no graves no evil no death no great years no stoop shoulders no mourning no crime we had life eternal we have the jurisdiction over all the earth we was just a god lower case that's all on the earth walk about the neighbor tree doesn't look right standing there we see a beat-up lot and set over there and it will do it the wind was blowing we didn't wonder will seblak peace be still and it did it what did he come to do to redeem all that back to us again get all that back and now Nietzsche in itself is groaning waiting for what manifestation of the sons of God for the sons of God to be made manifest can the church say many musician to get ready hallelujah and we have the earnest of our salvation now I can take our product at time with cancer and stand with a little breath of redemption and pray the prayer of feet over him and then return a shadow of a man back to healthy man again what will we do in our full possession comes so by the mantle when our full possession comes right then we have a little tongue payment but there's a full possession that is to come nature knows that nature's groaning and we are groaning with it nate is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because Nietzsche was cursed with its master when its master was cursed there Nietzsche fell with the master talking about Adam because Adam was master beauty but animals banished out of Eden power strip from him but when this kinsman redeemer come and redeemed back to man that's the master over nature then all nature is waiting for the man master and the church seaman Oh hallelujah all Nietzsche is waiting for its master and the masses asunder the earth that was given this now God will have his heavens of course but this was given to man and the kinsman redeemer come to redeem us back to that we lost so I want to say all the way he's seen as well as I said because Oh a story from Adam and through Abraham to David it's not just a be that we existed it's a take Blackwood Adam lost so the continuation of this book will end with being black where Adam was the continuation of book will be us and then back in photomania like John would scribble we shall reign on the earth hallelujah are you looking for that day are you on the expectation for that day listen to the prophets say it when the work is finished somebody said when the work is finished listen to the Prophet we will have all things again whatever I said what kind of things we will have all power we have eternal life we have eternal health we have eternal youth we have eternal power we are just eternal with the eternal and then we are all waiting for that time to come so that's what we're waiting on eternal power eternal life eternal health eternal youth and Balaban said this Sevenfold book of seven redemption plans have been brought to us that's what this book holds and when you have
