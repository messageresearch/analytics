this morning we have some sad news it's a family beach and it's going on to be with the lord we want to remember family in prayer and there are those who are sick among us that we also remember in prayer let's bar heads and close our eyes we thank god for her life and our testimony among us and her joy and saving the saints and the love shared the believers and we appreciate her and the time that god allowed her to be among us now another one has gone home and i like to say the long home we have houses but she's going across on the other side another solas cross beyond the river it reminds us that this is not the only place there's no only world there's another land there's another world and abraham was seeking that situation builder is gone the clock is thickened in all of us tick tick tick it's ticking one day we have to aim and meet him so we thank god that is the soul i was saved a soul that went on to meet the lord and that's something wonderful and i trust then that god would help a family that they too would want this precious salvation this this blood apply to their lives and their source so let's pour heads right now heavenly father we thank you for your mercy and grace lord we have seen different saints come true on this move on to the land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever father we thank you for the life of our sister pamela beacon and lord i pray you'll touch your husband a daughter and family father and all the connected family may you visit them with comfort may visit them with your love may you visit them with your grace may visit them with provision father and me your presence be with them in a special way we love you this morning and we ask that you come among us in a special way as we wait on you father and depend upon you in jesus name we ask it amen you love him this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord [Music] so this morning we want to go into the word uh romans 9. we want to read from verse 7 to 13 and hebrews 6 we want to read from 10 to 15. and before we read it let's boyce one more time heavenly father i pray that you would bless the word this morning may it inspire your people who are needy of you in this treacherous and perilous time that we live in granted lord in jesus name i ask it email and amen so you want to read romans 9 and hebrews 6. okay all right romans 9 reading verse 7 neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall i see be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for this word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither haven't done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it it was said unto her the elder shall save the younger as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated and reading from hebrews 6 10 for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed towards his name in that you have ministered to the saints and do minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not that ye be not slutful but followers of them who true faith and patience inherit the promises for when god made promise to abraham because he could not swear by no greater he swayed by himself saying surely blessed i will bless you and multiply and i will multiply thee and so after you're patiently endured he obtained the promise may god bless his word you may be seated oh praise god it's really good to be here it's a privilege to be in the house of god despite the pandemic despite the virus this fight in mutations and all the variations despite all of that but the church of the living god press right on oh blessed be the name of the lord so this morning our title the followers of them who true faith and patience inherit the promises i want to put the whole thing be not thoughtful as a tool longer title so followers of them who be through faith and patience inherit the promises number anthony i preach a tremendous message sometime back but this is only a test and this subject was the spiritual mind versus the carnal mind so i want to kind of hook into that a bit the spiritual man our spiritual mind versus the candleman you're going to see it with the canal believer and the spiritual believer praise god now before you become a follower of them who true faith and patience inherit the promise there was a small exhortation be not slutful oh hallelujah in other words you have to make sure you're not under the spirit of which is slow which is lazy not easily aroused to activity oh praise the name of the lord you sit down like a lump on a log oh that's not the attitude whatsoever you want to be in diligence you want to be in application you want to know what must i do how could i do it how much i press on that is what you want to know be not thoughtful oh glory to god but followers of them who to faith and patience it's not just faith alone because this race is a long-distance race so you have to work with patience if you're just faith and faith and faith it's not coming just yet oh god that just shall live by faith oh glory to don't pull it back he that will come will come oh give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah my god so slutful not me not easily aroused to activity i always hear me say action is caused but inertia just happens so when you see things happening is because somebody doing something action is caused the prophet take a rock and shoot up in the air and then dunk on a whirlwind he said you have to do something for something to happen you don't sit and steer you do something for something to happen if you never praise god before you open your mouth and give them a shout even never lift up your hands to do something yes sit and watch like it's some stuffed dog stuff stuffed all oh glory to god hallelujah amen amen now first peter 1 2 says pete an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers cut out your pontius galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia elect according to the full knowledge of god oh glory to god that's who the bride is you're elected according to what the full knowledge of god not your works not your failures not your past not what you have done not what you will do but you are elected according to the full knowledge of god that's where the election come from that's why god could say jacob i love he so i hate because god knew beforehand the choices that they will take could we give the lord a shout in the house glory lord god amen elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father true sanctification significant of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace

knowledge of god oh give the lord a shout i'm excited this morning oh glory to god talking to a bunch of church members we talking to the elect according to the full knowledge of god who we foreign called who we call it justified and we justified he had already glorified that is why we have a reason to shout this morning glory to god hallelujah men had failed for fear but the bride has been anointed with faith okay the lord i shout the government men don't know what to do but the bride know what to do with the word oh glory to god it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness every scripture had to be fulfilled every word spoken of the mouth of god shall be fulfilled he said my word shall not return unto me void all glory to god but it shall accomplish the purpose oh glory to

percent at least at least you keep it and you bury it you bury your talent none for you take it away from him if you're those that have not the little that they have will be taken from them unto those

and multiply and subtract god come to add and multiply and blessing i will bless thee and multiply and multiply to you and thy seed shall possess the kids of the enemy and because amanda swear by somebody greater there was nobody greater than him so he swore by himself oh that that that we can leave here right now we could close our service right now he swore by himself he don't have to ask our pastor if to bless you you don't have to pass to the deacon you don't have to ask your mother or your father or your uncle or who say you're blight that's a lie or give the lord a shout he swore by himself let the devil know that our god he swore by himself if this don't make you shout i don't know what wrong with your mouth hallelujah if this don't make you shout i don't know wrong with your heart in revelation 10 when that mighty angel came down with the swept back wings and seven thunders through their voices out he swore time shall be no more we're going to eternity oh give the lord a

saved him and gave him his covenant unconditional amen he didn't say abraham if you do a certain thing he said i have ye shall have it notice you will come to me in all age and peace 70 something years before it happened god said already save you not only you but your seed after you when you get to thinking of that when you get to thinking of that without any merits without anything god covenant was unconditional to abraham and god told him he saved him not only abraham but his seed also and abraham being 75 years old and sarah 65 years old 25 years past menopause lived with her since she was a young lady they were married they were not fertile and got told abraham you're going to have a child by sarah the impossibles and abraham believed god no matter how impossible it

the church therefore we ought not to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard we ought to give more earnest heed in other words don't come and just hear a service listen carefully listen with intent i want to know what god is saying you're listening with that intent to find out what is god speaking this morning what god is speaking to me therefore we ought to give the more earnest heat of the things which we have heard at least at any time we should let them slip he said oh god help me to drive this home in this tabernacle this morning i pray the holy spirit will sing that so deep into our hearts we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which you have heard what type of people are we to be when we see the great you overcome down and do these things he

stones we should never be slutful like we are never never be so we will go up to church and we will see what the lord will do sometime and bless us in such a way and then i'll go back and say in a very nice meeting nice thoughtfulness dinner no depression of the word we enjoy it that's not the main thing that's not we would not worship we we should not worship the lord just after we get to preaching the word as we usually do just worship them that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of our life when we at work when we should worship him every time the opportunity presents itself worship the lord by testifying of him oh you mean testimony is worshiping the lord yeah when you tell somebody how you love jesus when you tell somebody how you got saved if they don't even know what to tell just tell them how they get saved tell them how you're like oh you can't get lit now make sure your candle lit to tell them that if not go back home and get it lighted and then come with a candle and say hey i want to tell you something god light my candle praise the name of the lord and let your other part be dipping oil so your light carried out oh give the lord a shout in the house amen every time the opportunity presents itself worship the lord by testifying of him you if you see some of you ladies see a woman in the wrong worship the lord by twerking taking her and saying sister there's a better life than this you may not work when you hear a man using the name of the lord in vain get a chance to one side ship over and take him by the hand and say you there's a better life than this you shouldn't use those words and tell him in a meek gentle way not in our boss nothing usually boss in a meek gentle way because you were once cuss but too you was once like that too and god deliver you so don't play yourselves righteous over anybody oh my god walk with meekness sweetness humility these are words you don't hear much of oh my hallelujah but ibrahim he said god forbid he said what brother lyle and i reset out there sister moore's father how he told me that in the early days back in those days when they were persecuted and turned on from everywhere he was in a meeting once where they had forbidden them to worship the lord in the spirit and a group of people come and shut through the windows with pistols and rifles and our old sister standing on the floor with the hands up in the air praising god while the windows was being riddled with bullets and rifles and the bullets struck the woman's dress and filtered the flow without harming her he said we need to go back is he you hear that ten percent say amen and that god make the woman bullet proof and you say amen amen you understand what's going on here no weapon form okay did you do you understand that that when the batteries had no weapon form against you're gonna prosper the bible means just that the bullet could dip so zip swords zip so if it bonks so it fall off praise god that's why the holy ghost is real power you know america don't have that russia don't have that what we have this morning russia don't have america don't have president biden don't have president putin don't

of the world you could send prayer and the holy spirit take your prayer like an arrow oh glory to god the devil don't want you to know about the power that lays in prayer and the power that lays in the church your children are going to be delivered not only did we prophesy that but your prayer will see it materialized the devil is a liar he will glory to god he have a time limit when that jubilee trumpet belongs became the song all the names on that book shall be delivered he's said that time michael shall stand up oh glory to god and every name written in the book shall be delivered and if your son taught her name is in that book i don't care what they're doing this morning that is not important that is not relevant oh give the lord a shout hallelujah he said we need to go back to the power of god and something that can do the same thing today persecution always gives strength to the church we have had it too easy we get full we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything is just handed to us are you ready it takes sorrows and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit i remember when you were building this church it was sweat it was really barrel it was shovel it was mixing cement and it was a labor to get this going now it's complete we could just walk right in but it didn't just happen here oh glory to god and a revival it will just happen here it will take some sweat he could take some prayers he's going to take some faith he's going to take some promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit oh glory to god i'm going to flush out those who just in for the ride or give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord but abraham if you love god well we should be busy our hopes or desires we should be everything that's in us should be in the love of christ we set so unconcerned when the world is dying right under our feet when you think about it how much people die over a million how much two million three million from death some coronavirus question is are they what is saved did anybody get a chance to testify to these people before they cross over now they're crossing over hustling every minute think about it like a light flashing nice empty asmr a thousand years is one day you know so 70 years when you think you're living long long and again gray and you're getting both see back and all kind of thing and pain and thing as far as god concerned he's just born and gone that's what happened every day you know just life just just like that flashing people crying crying funeral and every hallelujah glory to god our last days there's some names to be called and god sent a message in this last day to call those names oh glory to god and if you hear your name you better rejoice you better thank god god sent you through the family that you could get in contact with this entire message there's not another messenger like it this is evening light message when cross darkness cover the earth across darkness covering the people and the pulpit black like night oh glory to god god send light that you shine our way seven voices seven thunder seven lights seven lamps oh glory to god to shine your way oh that there's going to be a rapture there's going to be a resurrection we shall not all sleep some will sleep but not all if the lord has showed some but not all oh glory to god we shall not all sleep hallelujah but ram say usually you take a state of emergency to trust into desperation it's too bad it has to do that but human beings are so slutful in their mind it takes a state of emergency something arises and when they do it it shows them into a desperation and then it shows what you're made out of you save the water dripping in a form of pipe in the house no problem a dripping drip drip drip your water they get dripping dripping you tighten it it's still dripping yeah fix it a month passed it's still dripping that's not a problem man you know the emergency as far as they're concerned it's just a driven pipe but let's fire us at the burner the matches catch any room you lose your house you lose your car you lose everything you know burn down flat so you see certain things go to love and bring and put the pressure on us for us to get desperate oh my hebrews 12 read in verse 14 to 17 follow peace after all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently least any man feel of the grace of god remember this is not unbelievers and carnal people and people playing carnival and playing mass this is church folks so he's talking to church people like we are yet tonight looking diligently least any man fail of the grace of god least any root of bitterness springing up trouble you just the root of it you know root of bitterness you know somebody do something and you're bitter and you're angry yeah you're angry and buddhists are not don't let the root balance again yeah we get angry we get upset that's okay but don't let that get down inside of you are you going to tell your friend and your aunt and your uncle and your enemy and everybody else has to know this personal enemy are yours and they do it this and they do it that i said forgive them in their butt and give me their butt you ever give them yet anytime you have butter you forget i'll forget them but anytime you have a butt you ever give them your toe when you forget because god don't say i forgive you but let god tell you that i forgive you no but remember what we do last night i can't i can't do that so i'm gonna i'm gonna look for a name and take it out that's why we talk about election up front elect according to the knowledge of god god can have new knowledge if he's obesity he can't come and says oh gosh oh make a mistake i didn't realize they were so bad you know i know there was kinda [Music] no no no god god god nothing that we we in that not not god human does do that but you catch in your mind a victim no no god have x god for knowledge identify you as his seed through christ not to your mother and father no through christ so this gospel has to get to you god has to move mountains he gets it to you god has to come to valleys he gets it to you he has to cross the ocean he will get it to you because you are see through christ i became smoking drinking adultery lying prostitution it doesn't matter what you are in he has to get this to you because that is the sea that's back here [Music] you may be seated now when you see that way you will understand in context when jesus said he needs patches of maria because he had to meet the woman at the well you understand now he was looking for that name her name could be mary jerry whatever name it had it doesn't matter the name her natural name the thing was the seed inside her soul she was messed up on earth but not in heaven we'll give the lord some praises my god so watch looking diligent at least any man fail of the grace of god listen the root of bitterness is springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled least there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one most of them meat sold his birthright and for you know that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sorted carefully with tears [Applause] so esau crossed a line and he couldn't get back with tears he sorted carefully and it didn't come true and the bible exists adobe like that for one more cell of food he was willing to give up his birthright for a muscle of food we find out esau truly represented the canal believer he was an earthly man was of the earth was very religious inclined religious incline he had a religion just like the world today man here we go is not the property of the church a lot of the pastors of the church has their own property that's not what the bible says i don't know what the prophet teaching you man is not the property of the church neither is man the property of the state man is the property of god sons and daughters of god we belong to him because we are bought with a price what a precious price the son of god oh glory to god so no man own you oh give the lord a shout not church on you no pastor owner come hither i will surely the bride the lamb's wife or give the lord some praises esau well represented that group of being religious i'm just as good as the next one my religion is just as good as yours i am satisfied but jacob his twin brother by election which was predestination by foreign knowledge came into this world and was a spiritual man to represent the spiritual people what jacob came to represent the spiritual people you mean trickster jacob you mean scamp jacob your means called dog jacob you mean jacob that trying to defraud everybody of everything he represent the spiritual yes because when you're past the natural part you recognize he's hungering for righteousness and he's hungering for the holy ghost and he intend to get it by any means necessary if it means cooking a good piece of lentil for his brother to offer that birthright he going to do it or give the lord a shout my god and i'm looking at the bride this morning they're gonna get that extra oil by any means necessary or give the lord a shout don't let nobody keep it back from that oil [Music] he he had spiritualism of what was right and wrong and the entire church of the living god is built upon revelation of jesus christ and we know what jesus told peter upon this rock i will be my church and that was spiritual revelation isn't that right praise god no jacob it meant so much to him but the birthright meant nothing to eso frankly he despised it and i say this with all reverences children still does that's right and despises it what do i have to do for them why should i receive the holy ghost i am just as good as you are my religion just as good as yours why should i go up to up there i'm just as good as you are i go to church i got my name in the church book got my team in the book that's what you are that's what you are in the sight of god you've got to be born again and be spiritual minded so it didn't mean anything to esau he despised it and the carnal believer today still despises the boot right and the birthright is the holy spirit how come you don't hear that much but the birthright is still the holy spirit you have to fight for it you have to wrestle for it oh glory to god you have to press for it the kingdom of god is preached and every man every man one more time every man press the intake no preacher pushing you into it oh close no church could push that's why when people start to say this church my church the heaven whether they are liars the pastor line and the people lying too because this kingdom no man could push you into it you got to press your way the pastor is not going to be wrong when you're pressing your way when you turn before god and lean and grinding and groaning and travailing and asking what affiliate with the holy ghost the past has nothing to do with that this is god and his son this is god and his daughter this is calling his people oh glory to god you shall be my son and i shall be your god oh give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord my god my god and we find all this birthright meant everything to jacob now he didn't care for nothing about the birthright and he didn't care what it cost him aha what it cost him everything ever cost watch the free you know devil let it off you're free as an initial stage but he does give you because the wages of sin is still letter you see despite inflation that changed at all it's still dead hallelujah praise god so nobody would freeze stuff everything cost calvary cost the blood the price was paid for us it was a blood price we couldn't get back like that the chasm was too great oh we couldn't jump over what adam did he make a big chasm we couldn't cross over sin kept us done sin kept us born but the bible said when the lamb took the book he said thou has redeemed us by thy blood has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth or give the lord a shout how could mere sinners like us come to the spot to enter our priesthood and enter into a kingship that we could actually rule and reign on his head oh glory to god if we're going to rule then he'd have to start now oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] listen we have evidence that the book has been restored we have evidence the title deed of the earth is known back on the it what adam lost what was manifestation that lasted profit was manifested you owe no other man bringing evidence he himself said what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in his fullness when the press come otherwise i just shown you a demonstration of the power that is to come little fishy i give you back your life in the name of jesus christ and dead fish came back to life before the doctors and touches my wife the tumor will go down and the tumor went down it was stormy sun cometh and shine four days and the weather men had to change their prediction or give the lord a shout because the prophet spoke to the storm and said son come out oh give the lord a shout the book is on the earth the book is on the act glory glory to god [Music] [Applause] you might be seated do you understand since adam lost the book the book never came back down yet because the book was in the hands of the original owner waiting for redemption claims so since adam time that book went up when the devil looking to catch the book to the earth so he end up squatting here not illegal he end up illegal aim and spirits with all bodies fell from heaven looking to activate and jump upon people demon powers he don't belong here the earth is for the sons and daughters of the living god he's a squatter on this earth and one day we will look upon you look upon him and said is that the man that caused nation to tremble is that the man [Applause] let's let's look at it again adam lost the book the book went back and he has the original owner because satan have no rights with this greasy hand of unbelief to hold the book so god himself held the book oh he couldn't do nothing you had to wait talking about wait and wait jesus come he's still out of weight but jesus died to go and get the book and when he took the book he had to have a man on the earth to give the book not just any man but a prophet because the word come to a prophet not just any prophet but the seventh angels message that come at the seventh age so william branham was standing on the earth to catch the book and when he got the book he didn't keep it for himself he gave it to you oh tell the lord i shout no wonder we gonna have a revival no wonder we're gonna have a super church no wonder we're gonna have a super race no wonder we're gonna have that no devil could stop it there is gonna be signs there's gonna be wonders there is gonna be miracles and the power of god will be shaking this world once more the world will get direct from god and it will be plain or tape in church or give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] and i mean that it will not be playing brother branham tape in the church i'm not talking about that who want to do that let them do that but not this church we are preaching the word of god all glory to god and this church is sovereign no overseas on outside the church influence hallelujah [Applause] [Music] so brother branham was a dangerous man to the kingdom of hell because what he manifested the devil never saw before the devil knows he's in trouble he knows that because when jesus died he thought it was all over there was clinging glasses and toasting one another in hell until peter woke up the upper room and said these men are not drunk because you suppose but this is that that the prophet truly speak of oh the devastating just getting excited they're just getting excited oh glory to god when he said silver and gold have i known but such as i have i give it unto you rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ get off that crippled condition get off your wheelchair when you spoke that the devil knew it was the spirit of christ back among the church again back among the people of god again this one who cannot believe a natural believer this was the continuation of god a continuation of the book of acts oh gloria that is what that was oh hallelujah so what conclusion the devil going to draw from this 2020 prophet without a big education humble man meek man and with the power of god manifested through him hallelujah and see him taking off the scene and watching the prophecies i see a bride sealed into the kingdom of god she's written under the dynamics and the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost that they have worked in a small measure while the headstone coming down oh hallelujah and god release the seven seals and the seven angels come from eternity to gather all the scattered word the tied back into the word to bring down the holy ghost why can't i talk like that this thing is in me this court is all over me the secret is the word i don't have to call to you i know i am the coach oh glory to god i've been caught in so long i become the court itself we want to see fire on them quotes and one day god will send that fire on me like never before you'll hear quote after quote after quote by the spoken word oh glory to god what we see manifested temporarily we will see in this fullness there is going to be a super church not not church men's walking things super church with jesus walking in it he said the shout of the king will be in the camp when the short of the king in the camp everybody will hear it when a lion roar the lion is war privately another lion roaring when the lion won every beast in the jungle here in the lion oh glory to god when that land anointed come upon the bride every church every pentecostal church every methodist baptist church all them boxes message church they're gonna hear the rule of the lion among the bride of jesus christ elect according to the full knowledge of god oh i feel inspired this morning oh hallelujah i'm going to preach myself happy this morning oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory my god i can't almight wants to bring god wants god to bring the birth right down to their level but for me and i believe all true christians we meet at god's level i don't care what i have to do or what i have to say or how i have to act the only thing is i want it and that's what we need people to say i want it that's all i wanted i hear any word but i want it whether it wants i want the holy ghost i want the power of god in my life i want the well the artesian well in my life it will take all your blues away it will take all your frustration away what will your mother tell you all over your father tell you all with this when i tell you are you ever psychological kind of thing in your mind and that's why you show all that that's why i saw things that going not going that all that that kind of thing so good that go into oh glory to god only one thing you know you're fully persuaded that what he promised he is able to form and perform and you are one of the followers [Applause] of them who drew faith and patience inherit the promises oh glory to god hallelujah they can't have faith alone fate and patience some people will face and they get burnt out you know they're running but they fail to get another short distance they run hard and fast and burn out they don't see them again they run straight out don't treat the church a man will have to obtain if he obtains his book right he'll have to separate himself from the world just as jacob had to oh that's born of the spirit sometimes okay it means walking alone if you are really sincere and you really receive the book right you don't care to walk alone if the neighbor won't invite you anymore to dinner if nobody will have anything to do with you what difference does it make as long as you've got the boot right that's the main achievement of your life both this sense you have a three-story building and ten cars and a boat and a ship and a aeroplane and whatnot and then the grim reaper come and knock on your door and say tonight you're sold you cry heavy and you have some us dollars and some money in the bank and in back house you tell your computer hold on because i'll give this to the president i'll give this to this and that one oh hold that give me battalion i don't need that currency you know my currency is the currency of debt why didn't they call me the grim reaper i come to reap you tonight the bible tells them jesus said though fool tonight your soul is required of thee you're bigger you say you'll build bigger bands you're expanding your business you're doing this yesterday in your soul it's not just man alone you're not a dog or a cat you have a soul inside of you that's why you're in church this morning if the cat and dog had souls they wasn't in service this morning but you have a soul oh glory to god you can't just stay here you have to leave here come on preach back to me somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god all that is born of the spirit of god are led by the spirit of god and they're walking in the beautiful light of holiness and cleanness okay so i'm on the home stretch here they want to keep it long this morning the elder listen let it go remember turks to understand what i have just said and declare why students have never found paul seen at any time be born again and then be spirit-filled they have been filled it is deer but they have put their own meanings to make it see it but scripture does not say that jesus said saint john 7 37 in the last day the greater of the feast jesus said and cried if any man tastes let him come unto me and drink he that believeth me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water this speak he of the spirit the bible said this directly this speak he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because jesus was not yet glorified so he's saying this is the spirit that you have to get but you can't get it yet because jesus christ is not glorified yet but he is prophesy he that believeth on me after scripture had said out of his belly all of this prophecy shall flow rivers [Music] in other words you are have your own energizer you have your own well you have your own artisan well you don't need somebody to pump you up and push up oh glory to god you don't need somebody to fire up you have fire on the inside oh give the lord a shout now it says here distinctly and emphatically that the believer upon drinking of coming up by coming unto jesus in faith would have rivers of living water pouring out of him and it places his experience at pentecost now keeping this thought in mind we read saint john 4 10 if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that said unto thee give me to drink thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee living water this is jesus speaking more on the world but whosoever drinking of the water i shall give him shall never taste but the water that i shall give him shall be in him as a well of water springing up into everlasting life so jesus bring the context of this well not man jesus himself say how we're going to be let's continue this same living water is mentioned but this time it is not called a river it is called an artesian well there is where people made the mistake because it is called a well and a river they think in one place it is eternal life given by the spirit and next place where they said river in implying a great dynamism it has to be the spirit now given an endurance of power not so it is one and the same it is the spirit that gives life and power that came at pentecost that's why he said when our church is believing that the holy ghost is just as real as they fell on their pentecost we cannot believe less than that is how no new holy ghost is the same holy ghost he came to turn our ass back to the faith of the fathers to the holy ghost that they had or give the lord a shout what is causing this misunderstanding the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not by the word away with experience as your measuring line there's only one plumb line and that's the word now watch carefully and get this peter said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost paul said have you received the holy ghost since you believe this is the whole problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in water but they don't go on and receive the holy ghost you believe unto receiving the spirit believing on jesus is the first step in the right direction which is towards the holy ghost but the people stop there they go as far as water and then stop they believe and then stop the bible does not say when you believe you when when you believe it he said have you received the holy ghost since you believe the exact literal translation is did he haven't previously believed receive the holy ghost the people believe and then stop you don't receive the holy ghost when you believe unto him have repented you go on and receive the holy ghost do you see it that is what is wrong with our fundamentalists they have no power for this top shorter pentecost so i have a new word no fundamentalist so the fundamentalists in the message they have no power when you add talk they stop short of pentecost we cannot be no fundamentalist oh glory to god we can't be fundamental you have to be zealous for god oh glory to god amen they are like yeti comparison the children of israel who came out of egypt and stopped short of the promised land now those children of israel of egypt about 2 million strong they all journey together also they say miracles of god all part took of the same man and water from the spitting room all follow the same cloud by day pillar fire by night but only two reach the promised land only two are real true believers that is correct because the word tells us the rest of them died of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter in since that is so only two entered then the rest were not true believers what made the difference to stayed with the word when the hearth of the ten spies failed and clearness by near and these ten passes don't think there's ten believers you know there's ten bishops ten message poops all right hallelujah and you know what they caused the heart of the people to melt they say we see the land you know it flowed look at honey but what's that but but it's a giant that time caleb and joshua they they come back yet because they're blazing grapes they're blazing fruits at dinner man they're having a great time when they come back in are loaded with grapes they taught in this thing all that all grape juice what rung around the garment they camp moaning you see what happened giants caleb said a short man he got a box stamp on the box and said we are well able to take it let us go up at once at once and somebody said look at your tea shortening her boxy let's go up once to face giants shortest man they came talking about grenada no it's no this the eyes deceiving them they stop believing god you know but guess what shawty made it over joshua killer they made it over isn't that right and what did the holy spirit tell the prophet pick a pen and write he said in the last days let us stand like joshua caleb oh hallelujah praise god amen brother branham so all of us israelites saw the goodness and powers and deliverance of god they did not enter into the rest which is the time of the holy ghost so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of god oh you mean it's like that the message called three kinds and three kinds was journeying out but who gonna cross over into the land itself do you see that now so bare there so that that that rest was a bunch of people in them caleb and joshua they were the spiritual of that bunch you'll be the spiritual of the bunch that's why i say don't watch anybody and say you want to do like them look at the word because you could be looking at a carnal believer you could be following a canal believer don't follow nobody follow the word oh glory to god do you believe that all right let's continue now bubba says i want to go further and when i do i know i'm going to cause some emotions to rise and that is something i'm not responsible for i'm responsible to god and his word and the people god has sent me to i have to be faithful in all he gives to me to see so then he said oh quoting scriptures in john 6 all the father given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will know i cast out no man can come to me except the father which had sent me draw him our reason in the last day but as many as receive him to them give you power to become the sons of god even to them that believe in his name which are born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god now ephesians 1 and he started to read according as he has chosen him before the foundation of the world and we are predestinated under adoption by jesus christ himself according to the good plan of his will then he says this here now jesus christ nations get ready to come is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their brides today the bride today does not simply decide she's going to take a certain man for husband no sir it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his brain so in john 15 16 you have not chosen me but i have chosen you so he gave a scriptural basis for that the word right now according to the word of god the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this chosen of the bride was purposed in himself the purpose of god according to election my stand you can read it any other way you can't read it any other way the hard purpose here we go the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own chosen and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of status before god was god god is the object of worship he was known as the eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind before he was even god when he was the eternal spirit the pride was even in his mind and i was before the spirit become word because the word come in the beginning was the word before it was the beginning it was spirit the bride was back here oh glory to god that's why the bride is connected to spirit oh give the lord a shout do you see that this morning hallelujah now watch watch this now he was known as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of god the eternal are they not the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you see this you will see many things god is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and prove already god is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as god must be omniscient if he is omniscient that is all knowing then he is not no leaning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient the best we could say is that sometimes he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he always had always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is god oh give the lord i shout my god i feel like running around the building hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah praise god thank you jesus thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day and will be translated into substance and form they are already real and eternal and part of god that's why you could tell the devil have you considered my servant job there is not like him on the earth god already knew job can fail oh give the lord i shout glory to god amen these elect were not only the eternal thoughts of god which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these same elect are called by another name romans 4 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed that's why when the heads don't come it will come with shouting of grace grace unto it that you will have no works to boast to show how you made it there's a song oh i made it over oh my soul will look back and wonder how i made it over look at the lord i shout that's the grace of god hallelujah to the end the promise was might be to show to all the seed not only to that which of the law but to that authority of the fate of abraham who's the father of us allah because and he quote the scripture that we read hallelujah thank you lord and galatians 3 29 and if you be christ deny abraham's seed and ears according to the promise according to romans 4 16 we find that god has given a short promise to all abraham seed show promise and paul puts himself on all the believers under the designation he says abraham who is the father of us all and then he goes on not only narrow this definition but rather to finalize it and say in galician trees identify the seed singular with jesus and counter the seed children of promise do you see who you are a child of promise he promised you the holy ghost he promised you deliverance he promised you a breakthrough he promised you a healing you are child of promise oh glory to god and promised as having to do with election and the chosen of god and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the royal seed are the elect of god are the predestinated foreknown of god and we're in the mind of god in his thoughts in very plain language the true bite of christ was in the mind of god eternally do not express until each come forth in the designated decreed season so you had to be here in 2021 you had to be here in this hour this is your season this is your time god has designated for the world to become flesh in you oh glory to god and once the word become flesh the invisible becomes visible oh give the lord i shout in the house we are going back to eden oh glory to god we are going back to genesis thank you lord dr bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and although she is feminine in designation she she's also called the body of christ which is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predecimated in him and came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god in a memory membered body whereas one squad was manifested in one member even jesus christ hallelujah here we go there here we come to the conclusion as the great as the eternal logos god was manifesting the sun and jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead and the eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became a many members spoken with seed manifest in the flesh those eternal thoughts no manifest in the flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called so that's why he said you are not a believer the believer is the word in you do you catch it now it's not your flesh is the believer the believer is the word inside of you oh glory to god watch this now so watch and those eternal torts no manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as ye are so called we did not become seed by the reboot we will cede and therefore will reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to quicken my sheep hear my voice and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turn into a sheep oh glory to god when god find you in the gutter and pull you up and clean you up you are sheep since then when you must smoke in your worst sheep walk glory to god whatever condition you're in he was written to call you oh hallelujah praise god let's let's wrap up here now as many as i love is god's speaking arabic and cheese in greek the emphasis is upon poison i it does not say as many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is as many that are the loved ones of god it is his love in question not ours so once again we find ourselves glorifying in his salvation his purpose his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of god even as he said in romans 9 13 jacob have i loved does it now obtain that since he loved only the many is he therefore in a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn knight to him by no means is this so for he declared also in romans 9 13 he so have i hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it of him that call it and god call you my god you should be happy the silver man love him and honor him and worship him glory to god watch watch this now i'm closing this love is elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from human merit nothing you could do could make him love you more in that way his love is permanent his love is unchanging he call it elective love it's his love not yours oh give the lord an offering of praise [Applause] his love for them is apart from human merit for it says that the purpose of god stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything else before the chain was born he said as many as i love our rebuke and chasing to rebuke is to reprove to reprove his expose with a view of correction chasing doesn't mean to punish it means a discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind oh my hallelujah hearing lies fought the love of god he desired it in love a family of his own a family of sons you begin to pray play something softly a family of sons like himself so before him lines all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and under dishonor the chosen will be his own choosing those who then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their work he reproves with all long suffering and gentleness and mercy he chases me with knees guard hands sometimes his spotter must take the vessel he's working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he deserves but it is his love that is his love another way of his love there is not they cannot be all little flop do not fear this age is fast closing as it does those tears will be bound together as a three-fold court is not easily broken they will have tremendous threefold strength of political physical spiritual satanic power they will seek to destroy the bride of christ she will suffer but she will endure fear not these things that are coming up on the earth for he who loved his own lover them unto the end oh my hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah i don't act clean and pure and holy to make myself a christian but christ in me lives that in me i love him and i'll do anything wrong if i do anything wrong it will condemn me right there and i will say god forgive me every day i got to ask forgiveness every day and you do too certainly you do oh my harley i'm going to skip oh my god the spiritual man has a spiritual soul that can never die the canal mine has a religious atmosphere around him and wants to worship and so forth but that is kana not as unbeliever but the carnal believer that's the kind that was rejected esau represented the man of the earth natural religious inclined but never able it wasn't in him to do it he couldn't do it he never was in him to be able to climb past the things of the world the carnal thing but jacob it was easy for him to do it now jacob one purpose jacob had was the bit right about him says and that spirit of one bird is still representing the world today it's coming to a head now the spiritual believer and the canal man no one could say they wasn't both religious they were they didn't say that once their idol and the other one god they were both servants of god wow i didn't say it the prophet said this esau jacob stevens hallelujah they cannot believer today oh no i go to church do what's right what difference does it make but what the true believer they can't wait they get to put right oh let me just skip down here hallelujah so when they came up to the promised land they were headed to the promised land not invaders but believers believers the same god israel had they come tried to kiss his brother because he was his brother he surely was unrighteous he said but they failed to see his election and balaam can only come and curse and so on like but you can't kiss what god bless you cannot curse the elect of god among the elect only we'll have love in the last days oh glory to god let me see wrap up here okay i'm going to close to this here hebrews 10 i'll go closer with the scripture cast under way there for your confidence which had great recompense of reward for you have near patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come i will retire and the josh are lit by faith and if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to deceive of the soul let's all stand and worship the lord oh glory to god [Music] oh you are on your
