honor oh blessed be the name of the Lord what can we say are you happy to be in the house of the Lord are you on expectation for God to go exceedingly abundantly above whatever you could ask or think this evening so we under great expectation and we thank the Lord uh for what he has done and the service how many appreciate the service last night brother stephanus may the Lord richly bless you tonight and um I'm here to introduce brother stepanus but we also have our precious brother yadel tonel with us this evening how many appreciate our precious brother yadel thornel amen and um we are so blessed and uh before brother stepanus speaks this evening we'll be inviting brother brother yadle to greet the church and I know we put him on the spot but he's a soldier and we know what soldiers do soldiers do what soldiers could do so we are we are blessed so as he comes let's just sing that song God can do it again and again God can do it again and again and again there's no reason to doubt God can do it again yesterday and the day before he is always the same there's no reason to doubt God can do it again oh God can do it again you believe that and again and again there's no reason to

again and again and again Hallelujah why should be done he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah we may just have our seats just a moment we greet you all this afternoon in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's a privilege to be with you all uh in this impromptu way but we believe that God has uh you know all planned out before the foundation of the world you know he is on schedule he's always on time and uh you know we are the ones that ear this Journey on the walk and we seeing things coming to pass but it is already part of his plan and you know the sons of God are led by the spirit of God so you know uh a few days ago brother Isaac called me and he told me that brother stephanus would be coming and he just would like to let me know he would like to see me so I this was the only opportunity that we have and I just thought it fitting to put off all that I had to do and just make it up here this afternoon to see him amen it's good to know Brethren of like Precious faith and I believe that we were there before the foundation of the world attributes in his mind and here manifested on the earth and it's one God we serve we all have one father one Lord and we believe we all going to one place and we all going to be changed at one one time so I know brother when the power of this church Rises brother you're going to call the others brother but if Germany get it before us we all had to be changed in that moment Hallelujah so we will be changed at the same time by God's grace and just for a little scripture reading you know if we turn into our Bibles 1 Corinthians chapter 13 um we could just stand just a moment well I'll just read one verse for you you charity verse 8 never fail it but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether be the tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away we know in part and prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away Hallelujah glory be to God in the highest we may have our seats this afternoon as the Lord had his blessings and you know Paul here speaking to the Corinthian Church you know that is so uh lovely to see that in the midst of all the correction he could address love because we know Corinthian was a church of correction he had to correct you know things uh monetary things among them he had to correct things uh immoral living among them he you know and some of they were a bit puffed up who baptized who and he had to correct a certain popularity Spirit among them uh so Paul corrected a lot of things among the Corinthians and at the end you know he came here and he's showing us the bond the above all that we need and all the tongues and some things not correctly placed in the church but above all at the top hallu is Charity all these other gifts May cease but where there is Charity that never fails and Paul is connecting now that charity with perfect man yes sir not a child but an adult Hallelujah not just an adult but a man and this word that they use for a man is a speaking man Hallelujah so it's not just a man without knowledge because as as although we are Sons we differ nothing from a servant don't we be Lord of all things all right but we must come up to a certain level before the father could place a certain Authority in our hands so Paul Paul here is speaking to them he said we know in part and we prophesy in part and many times things would come forward but all these things are just partial in comparison with the reality that is to come so the Old Testament is a shadow of the new and when you look in the Old Testament there are a lot of partiality in the Old Testament a lot of types A lot of Shadows but as you start to move forward and the shadow becomes more to the reality ity it shows that the image is coming closer to the light Hallelujah as the image come closer to the light the shadow disappears and we come into the presence of the reality so Paul is showing us here uh we see darkly now through a glass but we moving from Darkly through a glass to where we come now face to face Hallelujah face to face brother that is bright age that is for our age Hallelujah we saw the face here hallelujah Moses on a man that God would speak lip to air face to face so we come now where God has chosen a prophet in this hour and we had face Toof face connection brother this scripture relates to our age because our age is the age for perfect realization all that was typed in the Old Testament so in the Old Testament you saw Moses with the bread of life but the bread of life if you try to not the bread of life but the Mana which the Old Testament the Saints eat if they try to keep it for the next day what happened it spoil so that man could only last a certain time but just that was a type of who he would be amen amen but when the true Bread of Heaven came Hallelujah glory be to God in the highest brother a man eat from that bread he never hunger again Hallelujah isn't that right that bread except you eat this bread except you eat my flesh except you drink my blood you have no life in you that was the perfect bread standing there it was no longer partial that bread could never run and watch Hallelujah that bread is the bread that they put behind the veil where the glories never fail and the priest alone had the ability to go in there and pull out some mana and eat so partial became perfect in the man in Christ Jesus but the reality that Christ came back in our day Hallelujah through a Vindicated prophet and we had true interpretation of the word by Divine Vindication Hallelujah because God is his own interpreter of his word we had true bread amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out the mou so partial mana mana was typing quite back there the opening of the full word seven seals for us over in this day where a people could Feast on this and that Mana will never die Hallelujah they had partial water in the Old Testament they drank from that water but they T again but when the real water came Hallelujah the real water to met a woman by the well Hallelujah and he say you drink from this water you never thirst again Hallelujah that is perfect water he start on the last year the feast If any man tunger any man thirst let him come unto me out of his bellies from his innermost beings shall flow rivers of Living Water Hallelujah the paral became perfect in the man Christ Jesus Hallelujah so this is the age now where all those types have become a reality we going to see face to face now this is the junction that we are and moving from anti type to type it moving from Brother h a shadow that we had in there to a reality in this day and it moving now from where you know the concept that man had of Jesus being you know like uh the son all that the father had Hallelujah he poured into Christ but Christ as a son he referred to Jesus as the father but that son brother became the father he actually was the father but as a son he didn't know certain things as a son the day and the hour he said only the Father Knows as a son he was limited as a son he could have died Hallelujah but that son moved from a son to where he ascended on high to the right hand and he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me Hallelujah you know what the prophet said he said if there was another God in heaven he would have been powerless Hallelujah he got all power it move from my father's house to my house so Saints we moving from partial into perfect and perfect is face to face it's bringing us now to that moment in the twinkling of an eye perfect is on top of the the Capstone perfect is on top not down at the bottom now Perfection is for our age Paul planted this is where we come back to spoken word is the Original Seed and we saw a man in our age back as Adam was Hallelujah that is perfection we saw a man brother that could speak and animals will obey we saw a man that no sickness could have stand in front of him amen we saw a man with power brother over the elements brother we saw a man brother that Jesus said Greater Works than these shall you do but we didn't see Jesus create but we saw Jesus in a Kentuckian flesh brother speaking and creating Hallelujah when that which is perfect is come sir it's perfect realization as we near the Capstone she will be a super Church is is his coming bringing us is he magnet magnetizing us we remember the magnet that pass over the the the machinery shop to take up all the shavings is the magnet pull the shavings up when that which is perfect he is the perfect one and it's perfect word coming to a bride hallelujah what SS the perfect word when I was a child I speak as a child but notice at child have the same DNA the father at that age he said father Hallelujah but in moving from Spirit of adoption to adoption itself when that same son will become a speaking son watch the quickening Power don't make you a son the Dynamics in coming to now make you a son because you are Sons we could be reborn Hallelujah and that power coming upon you to change us from children we pass a little adolescence age Hallelujah we pass adul and we coming now to where we can speak on behalf of the Father the Perfection is drawing us Sons into that reality that is where we are by God's grace every day this word comes it draws us up into the fullness of the reality of who he is you know what the prophet say hallelujah when you recognize this word to be Eagle food you have heard from your te then hallelujah we come to a stage where Christ impersonated in his word made flesh amongst us the lamb is on seen breaking the word that is the Perfection that drawing us up all over all the denominations over all the things of this world into the reality of the word we love the Lord Jesus Christ this afternoon I feel so blessed when you sister sang that song just now because on the road the Lord just put my this little thought on my heart coming up and I heard the sister singing it here about charity and we moving from children to sons and amen so I believe the spirit of the Lord is amongst us the fullness of the word as she nears him the word is coming in its fullness of its power performing a work amongst us and we all will be changed any moment in the twinkling of an eye may God bless you all we love you all happy Easter Easter is resurrection over the resurrection that was but oh what a resurrection this is to recognize we are Sons and Daughters of God we are Eagles tonight Hallelujah God bless you by God's Amazing Grace Shalom amen amen you appreciate precious brother yadel thorell this evening amen what a time we are having in the presence of the Lord this evening so we are blessed and God has more in store for us tonight and um I I challenged brother the stepanus you know when he came down I think we told the church originally he was going to speak twice and I say but stephanus you come too far to just speak twice and I I I challenged him and he went to the Lord and you know we had some fellowship and the Lord had it has made it possible for him to speak to us tonight as well so we are blessed to have a stepan speaking tonight and he'll be speaking to us in the morning as well I know I was blessed last night and I've always been blessed by his ministry he's a true servant of the Lord a true heart and a true burden for God's people and I know that God is going to use him mightily tonight to bring a word and I truly believe that sons of God in this season are really microphones that God could speak through we don't have our own thoughts our own ideas the word is already revealed the prophet already came we are just standing here as a microphone that God could speak lip to air to his children and minister to your need whatever that need is tonight I pray that God will speak to your need this evening so may the Lord richly bless you so as brother

whoever may hear this hear this message amen may it be a blessing unto you praise the Lord because there's some big struggles in this day isn't it true there's some big big struggles amen darkness is coming in darkness is coming is squeezing In Praise the Lord and and people are looking where is the presence of light because darkness is so strong and people are missing the presence of light and praise the Lord they they're missing the power to overcome and the presence and the strengths and they're missing Christ in their lives praise the Lord because sometimes the the the struggles get too big praise the Lord and I've gone through that my my my own life I've been through that and I had a time in my life praise the Lord where where there was not a presence of God praise the Lord but the time had an end praise the Lord because time has a beginning and time has an end praise the Lord an absent has a beginning and an absent has an end praise the Lord because God is eternal and an absence is only a space of time praise the Lord maybe tonight the absence is broken the silence is broken the absence is broken there was a time of a Silence of half an hour but one day it was broken one time it's broken praise the Lord amen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord so this is my desire for tonight and I want to speak about it and before I go into it and especially to address the young people in here there some very young ones some older ones praise the Lord and many times we speak about Moses and Moses was 80 at a burning bush Hallelujah and we speak about Joshua this old Fighters praise the Lord of the facei but there were also some young ones some Gideons praise the Lord some Davids Hallelujah some young people that took up the struggle they took up the fight they took up the water hallelujah praise the Lord amen praise the Lord now what is very amazing I was searching I was searching in the internet praise the Lord about a question and sometimes we have questions in our life and I was questioning how old was the disciples praise the Lord and it's a good question and there's not really a Bible scripture to it but many scholars and many people that are studying the scripture they went into it and they wanted to find out about what age were the disciples and I want to leave that with you because this is quite something for the young people I never went in there today it's the first time but the scholars you go into it and they take different hints to say how old have the young people been how old have the have the disciples been and we will find out that if was some young people in that generation is that right praise the Lord now to to understand that what the scholars did and I think we can follow the pattern he said they go in a Jewish custom in a in a in a in a in a custo in a customary of the Jews about a child and it says a child is trained about that age of five years and a child gets a training about the Torah about about the Old Testament and it starts to get trained from 5 years on so after 5 years the teaching starts about the Torah so then they have a time and a season of teaching and he said after about some say about 12 which we know is the age of accountability some say 13 and some say up to 15 years praise the Lord they have been taught by a teacher am but he said after 15 years they're going out and if they're interested and if they have the ability but they must be interested they must be interested in the Torah they must be interested in the law of God they must be interested in the Commandment of God he says then they're going out to find a tutor they're going out to find a rabie and that starts at the age of 13 or 15 praise the lord they're looking for a rabbie they're looking for a rabbie where they can follow and the scholar say where they can follow and pattern his life so they're looking for a very good tutor they were looking for a very good rabbie praise the Lord and they had a desire every one person that say looking for rabbie he wants to have the best rabbie praise the lord and there are some they're trying to look with an intelligence to find the most intelligent rabbie praise the Lord but there are some they have the right heart the seed of God praise the lord they're looking for a rabbie with the right heart praise the Lord and it starts at a very young age praise the Lord so this was so we know so so so the disciples have been in an age praise the Lord where they were looking for an Rabbi praise the Lord so they were at a young age so it could been 15 it could be 13 it could be 16 17 18 praise the Lord very young age so the scholars come from the other side and they come from the end of the disciples and they were counting back and say how old have they been so and um first of all first of all before we go into old they said they said if they were no more children with 13 because they were already experienced they were fishermen they had their own boat they were going out the whole day working already so they had the ability actually to work the whole day and to earn some money so it was not perhaps at the age of 13 but maybe age of 16 or 17 or 18 I don't know I we don't know but another striking thing is he said normally he said at the age of 20 the people are married in Israel as it was custody so the only one that was married was Peter and Peter was the oldest and the others were not married okay and Jesus loved to have fellowship with the young people praise the Lord he Lov to be among the young people and it's very striking because Lazarus and Maria and Mara were not married so it must have been the only thing what I F what they found out if you don't marry was because of leprosy in the family that was a reason not to marry not to continue that so somehow if three of them were not married it must have been some young people praise the Lord and Jesus loved to be among young people praise the Lord and young people were looking for the right rubie is that right praise the Lord so don't take it as a law but take it as an approach to say Jesus loved the young people and he wanted to be around them and he knew they needed a rabie he knew they needed a guide he knew they needed a comforter they he knew they still have to learn praise the Lord this were young how do you say young wine tubes they were flexible they were ready to learn they want to approach something in life they were not settled they were not satisfied with the things they heard but they wanted some more praise the Lord hallelujah and they wanted somebody to follow and to follow follow his patter after the rabie until age 30 so once they reach age 30 they should be mature enough to be become an own rabbie and to get disciples to themselves so they have been under 30 years about and if you look about Peter himself he counted him an old man 60 years 30 years after Jesus pass it made him about 30 years old praise the Lord maybe younger maybe 20 we don't know the gospel of Matthew was written 30 or 40 years after Jesus resurrecting indicating Matthew was perhaps in his 20s okay so this are just like something we we would like to approach that because many days and that's what all the scholars what they writing is many times they they they they you see the pictures they are drawn and you see old man sitting together with Jesus but I want to change the picture tonight because it was young people looking for rabum and John according to church history lived the Longs 60 years after Walking With Jesus he was 90 years old so he was 30 years but probably 20 he said old enough to take care for Jesus mother that's what we know he was old enough to take care but he was some young people praise the Lord so this said this praise the Lord amen a little approach to say that the disciples have been a young young people they needed a rbie they were not ready yet to lead themselves and they said heart they saw something in Jesus he said I see that what he says where was thou where was th you were there under that tree how do you know H you must be the Messiah they recognize Jesus as a messiah we have found him come and see he's the rabie he's the high priest he's the highest rabie praise the Lord I give up all everything and follow Jesus that makes it easy to follow Jesus if you recognize who Jesus is praise the Lord and say we need a rabbi we need somebody to follow praise the Lord and brother they were growing in the face they were coming to Perfection praise the Lord raise up from children praise the Lord but coming to be mature and Al enough praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah just give him praise andall Hallelujah say thank you Jesus you have chosen me I not chosen you but he has chosen you praise the Lord and Satan can do nothing against it he has chosen you praise the Lord he was just looking to pass your way he just looking to a crossroad where he can wait on you praise the Lord where you were coming along praise the Lord he was looking for that place in 2024 where he can meet you praise the Lord and say here I am I'm the big Shepherd come unto me praise the Lord follow me and he said my sheep hear my voice and they follow me and a stranger they don't know praise the Lord and his disciples who have been with Jesus he was a he was in his 30 he was ready a rabbi he was trained from childhood we know when he was 12 years he left his parents and went into the temple praise the Lord he was mature was looking is there a rabbie praise the Lord but he had a rabbie a rabbie in heaven and he told Mary I need to be with at my father's business he had his rabbie praise the Lord and he was talking with the rabbie on Earth but he was 12 years identifying it that 12 years was an age to move out praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah and 12 years he was ready he was prepared he was ready to get some disciples amen according to the Jewish tradition praise the Lord so God had all a program and he worked it out surely he did praise the Lord so praise the Lord here some young people are go going along with Jesus praise the Lord and Jesus wants to train them Jesus wants to train them to stand alone in the darkest hour to stand praise the Lord in 2024 to stand praise the Lord Jesus is training you to to stand when there's no light to stand David was strained to stand David said if I make my bed in hell he's still with me David was a trained young man he knew how to stand he knew that the presence of God is with him always and he knew how to activate the secret he knew how to activate the presence of God praise the Lord read Psalm 23 doesn't it activate the presence of of God praise the Lord surely surely goodness and mercy is following me all the days of my life maybe maybe that was something David said when he was 30 he was trained praise the Lord he said the Lord never leave me he went through his battles praise the Lord and He knews the Lord never left him praise the Lord and he knew how to call down the presence of the Lord praise the Lord let us stand and read the scripture hallelujah praise the [Music] Lord let's go to John 14 praise the Lord and I want to speak tonight about overcoming in the absence praise the Lord because in the absence of his presence there is where you have to overcome young people and you are more than than Overcomers let me put that first you're more than Overcomers because the seed is in you praise the Lord Satan didn't put a seed in you but God before the foundation of the world put a seed in you and there's a promise to that seed said this seed shall inherit the gates of the enemy it shall Prevail in the darkest hour in the absence and 2,000 years ago Jesus was in the Tomb the tomb was closed and it was an absence and the disciples were in an absent [Music] situation and I want to take the scripture for the time of absence in your life let not your heart be troubled praise the Lord let it not be troubled if Jesus says that it finish it amen Lord I don't have to trouble my heart is not troubled my mind might be troubled yes I have reasonings I have imaginations I have reasonings I have I have I have the different things that are coming to my mind my mind is troubled but Lord Jesus you told me let not my heart be [Applause] troubled believe in God and believe also in me the rabbi is speaking in my father's house there are many Mansion if it were not so I would have not told you he's giving them a promise I go and I prepare a place for you Jesus says I go there will be some time of absence I will go there's a time of absence but he said don't let your heart be troubled he said praise the Lord I'm going for a reason I'm going in my absence I have a reason to go I'm preparing a place and that place is not for myself that place is for you be not be troubled and if I go and prepare a place for you yes sir he said I will come again the absence will have a finish in your life absence has a finish praise the Lord the time of her absence of his presence will have a finish because he said I will come again I come again to you personally in 2024 on our Easter Saturday I come to you personally the absence has a [Applause] finish and I Come Again With a Purpose Hallelujah in his meetings to receive you unto myself there's a purpose of the word there's a purpose of the spirit he says I want to receive you to myself that where I am there you may be also Heavenly Father we have read your word Lord Jesus we thank you for your presence Lord Jesus Lord may you open up father Lord this beautiful scripture Lord father this beautiful Promises of your word Lord Jesus that we can go out father Victorious father from every absence in our life tonight father Lord Jesus we pray it in Jesus name father amen and amen amen you may be seated hallelujah amen for the technician you can put up this this first slide with Jesus on the sea praise the Lord and when I speak with to the young people sometimes I just take one or two or three slides and I want to use it tonight too for an encouragement for you and to get a bit better picture praise a lot about a situation of an absence and that's the first situation I want to speak about an absence and now we heard and we know that the disciples were on a training field and Jesus the rabbie was training them for life because he knew there would come a time they would have to stand alone praise the Lord and Jesus is look not looking on the failures praise the Lord Jesus was not looking on the failures of Peter because he said Peter I have prayed for you praise the Lord if you fall in absence I have prayed for you that your face will not cease praise the Lord so here we see Jesus walking on the water praise the Lord now let me tell you now this is the scripture we're taking from Mark 6 praise the Lord and Mark 6 says that Jesus was on the mountain he went to the mountain to pray praise the Lord and he sent his disciples away and praise the Lord and when Jesus sends you you can be sure no devil can come against you except unbelief sets in Praise the Lord so Jesus sent him to go on the other side Jesus told him that in his Destiny is the other side of the sea praise the Lord but somehow in the middle of the sea a storm rages up praise the Lord and Jesus was not present he was absent in the middle of the sea and something happened to them and they didn't follow their heart but somehow reasoning set in imagination setting in if this boat will drown we're in the middle of the sea at the false watch of the night we in the middle of the sea and the reasoning started running the imagining started going praise the Lord and and they were troubled praise the Lord much trouble when Jesus is not there praise the Lord but Jesus gave them the word and said go on the other side there was a commission praise the Lord one time Jesus said go two by two lay their hands on them and the sick shall be healed now then there were a little bit more advanced and they went and they healed the sick the sick got healed two by two they went praise the Lord and they came back rejoicing and they rejoiced that the demons were obeying them and Jesus said don't Rejoice that but Rejoice that your name is written in heaven praise the Lord praise the Lord because he said your destiny is in heaven praise the Lord Rejoice about it praise the Lord amen but here a short while Jesus says go on the other side now Jesus in intention to go also on the other side let us go in the scripture Mark 6:47 and when even was come when Eve Ean the Eve was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land and he saw them toiling rowing now if Jesus saw his disciples rolling trolling rolling whatever he's looking down tonight and he sees if there's anybody in here if there's anybody listening that is trolling the boats the ship the Troubles of life has started a boat to troll and to roll in a hard sea but Jesus is looking down and he sees that but he said go on the other side you have commission go on the other side and he was alone and and he saw them toiling not rolling toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary to them and about the Fourth Watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them now have this picture Jesus is sending them he said go on the other side and he speaks and he says I want to meet you on the other side and he sends them the wind comes the storm comes he sees them and Jesus says I have to make myself I have to go on the other side too because I have an appointment on the other side and he made them as he would pass by it says and he would have passed by them that that means jesus' purpose was to pass by he would have passed by them praise the Lord he had a purpose he had a meeting point on the other side praise the Lord and he wanted to meet his disciples on the other side that was the situation because Jesus he had a big healing campaign on the other side amen he was focused he said there going to be some demons driven out on the other side some lame will be walking some blind will be seeing on the other side praise the Lord and he was making to pass by verse 54 and they were and when they were come out of the ship straight away they knew him let let us go before praise the Lord because his Destiny was on the other side on the other side what happened we come shortly verse 48 and he would have passed by them and when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit praise the Lord they didn't recognize the presence of the Lord they were not trained yet well praise the Lord but Jesus was the rabbi and he says I'm going to train them praise the Lord so he's passing them by he's walking them and he wants to know how is their reaction do they recognize me and the disciples young in age they looking and they say they said is a ghost they didn't recognize Jesus sometimes we didn't recognize his presence we think it's a ghost it's a strange but a great rbie is there now the now the Bible says and take verse 49 and verse 15 together because it's a double dot here they supposed it had been a spirit and then they cried out double point for they all saw him they saw his a spirit and then they saw him double thought and they cried out because they saw him they recognize it's not a ghost somehow they recognize it's a rabbie walking on the water Brothers can you put up the picture again why I love this picture because this picture somehow they created it a big storm and you see how the waves going left and going right now you said it all the fullness dwelt in Jesus Christ 20,000 years before amen the same Jesus in the form of the pillar of fire was coming on the water and a ways moved left and right left and right for a people of Israel to walk through on dry feet the presence of God was already on the water and what it did it put the water to the left and the right you can keep the picture up thank you Brothers now Jesus the fullness of God dwelt in him and he started to walk on the water praise the Lord and the water Stood Still praise the Lord it couldn't move when the presence of God was there hallelujah praise the Lord where Jesus was everything has to set still praise the Lord and Jesus was walking on dry feet praise the Lord there was no drowning because here comes the master praise the Lord 4,000 years ago the same spirit of God was bruising over the water and the water recognized the same Jesus is walking on me now he's going to do another miracle the same Jesus walking on [Applause] water the water recognized it but the disciples did not why was it that the water recognized it that it was Jesus it was strong it holded it the elements got fixed the elements normally is a very solid if you take water and you run it through your through your fingers it just run through but when the master was coming these elements got straightened out they got their mind fixed nature got their mind fixed when Jesus was coming praise the Lord and was carrying Jesus [Music] Christ but the disciples had too much reasoning the water has no reasoning the water is just running the way God told the water to run it says you're a liquid element and you run down everywhere you find space and you Marvel on that one if you have a hole in the roof somewhere the water will come down praise the Lord the leak will be here but the water will go down there because the water will find a way to go down if there's any leak the water will find it praise the Lord so that's the law of water it was given by the Creator and it has no reasoning the problem was the disciples had reasoning praise the Lord praise the Lord but one day was coming when the word says greater is he that is in you when those disciples got adult greater is he that is in you and the elements started to obey elements of sickness had to change their law because their element of law was timely sickness is timely but his presence is eternal and his presence prevails so they were in their imagination in their reasoning and it got them in trouble praise the Lord but the master was training them praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord and Jesus praise the Lord and immediately he says immediately he talked with them when they recognized him and he says unto them be of good cheer it is I be not be afraid praise the Lord he come with a comfort the comforter has come to them praise the Lord now brother brandham in the message the healing of y's daughter he says so we see him tonight going up on the mountain and disciples trust out in the sea and pick up their ores and their little ship sale went up and away they started oring across the other side where Jesus was to meet them on the other side then going in the absence of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord oh Christ then in the visible form on the road over trouble sets in Praise the Lord outside of the presence of the Holy Spirit brother BR says trouble sets in and usually if you start anywhere without Christ troubles on the road praise the Lord that's why an absence comes in our life praise the Lord just just as soon as the Devils sees you out of fellowship with Christ praise the Lord so God Is Watching and the devil is watching you too and brother B says as soon as you get out of his presence then he is a way to tackle then he is a way to come in Praise the Lord right then he will set out for you as hard as he can just as soon as he sees you away from prayer and away from consecration Satan will catch you right then if he possibly [Music] can and I believe we know these times in our lives when we have let down the barns of our prayer life and our consecration to him and give him room give him room in our lives and we all have fallen short of that but the rabbi was training us he was teaching you he showed them the elements have respect when I'm there praise the Lord my title tonight overcoming in the absence praise the Lord when you're alone when nobody is around when you're feeling down when you're feeling sick when you feel that all hope is gone praise the Lord he's training you to [Applause] [Applause] overcome let me move on time is precious brothers please put on the next slide you see a tomb and you see a stone before the tomb when the stone was closed it speaks about another absence of the rabbie and again again again the disciples were called in a situation where the rabie was absence and they saw death has put an absence praise the Lord praise the Lord why was the absence Jesus said and he answered that in John 219 he said destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up again Jesus told his disciples and Jesus told the world he had three days I'm going to be absent he said my absence has a beginning and my absence will have an end and in between was a Saturday that's why I preach about an absence on a Saturday praise the Lord but remember the absence had an end too because he had had a beginning praise the Lord and Jesus he died he laid in the Tomb his body laid in a tomb and he went down now Jesus in spirit he was not dead he was alive he had a commission to do but it was in The Invisible real he said here I have to do a chop and he went down to the souls in prison he went down to pick up the key from Satan on a Saturday praise the Lord SS in prisons there were some saints down there there were in the absence of the light Moses was in the absence of the pillar of fire job was in the absence of the Redeemer for some time Joseph was in the absence of perfection for some time praise the Lord but that absence at a beginning and that absence at an end it started with a death they put this the bones of Jo of of Joseph they put them in Egypt not in Egypt because but he said take my bones in the promised land not in Egypt he said take them out of Egypt because he know the time will come for when the absence has an end and there will be a resurrection in the land of promise so he said take my bones in the right place because my absence has a beginning and my absence has an end and when Jesus was going down on a Saturday praise the Lord and brother Brandon he's so beautifully he illustrates that he said praise the Lord he said he says all demons and all demons had a break Revival a great Revival because they thought now they had Jesus they said now they have silenced Jesus they have silenced the presence of God on the earth because they saw what Jesus was doing on the earth and they thought they silenced him but little did they know the silence was only lasting for three [Music] [Applause] days and they had a revival going on now we have him now he's gone now he's finished and B says suddenly a knock on the door of Hell a knock on the door of hell he says Sayan my absence for you has an end I'm here give me the Key of Life give me the key of hell and he took the key and he came walking and he came walking and Moses heard some steps he said this steps they sound a little different this steps sounds like a redeemer and chob heard the steps he said I know the steps I know my redeemer lives I hear the steps of my redeemer praise the Lord he's coming down a Dusty Road in Hell he's coming down to praise the Lord and suddenly they hear a key a key of life and Jesus opened the door and said come along your absence has an end your absence Moses has an end your absence Gideon has an end your absence Joshua has an end the Lord of host is back in the building I met you there in the battlefield Joshua but now the absence is over I'm back again I'm your lord of the host I come to redeem you praise the [Applause] Lord but in the visible realm you can put up the picture again people said there's nothing I could speak about a seven seal broken 61 years he came back as sea was broken again absence had an end for the bright he said I have some seats under the seventh seal they know my presence they know me and I call them it's time now for Redemption Redemption by Blood and Redemption by power at that time the disciples in invisible realm praise the Lord that's where God put them that's where God put them to train them the grave was closed amen they didn't know what was going on there they was shut am amen praise the Lord and some shut themselves in they went in Jerusalem in a in a house and they said Jesus is gone the rabbi is gone we follow it holy did we follow the lord we've been obedient in all his ways and now they have taken him away and fear sets him a fear Came Upon them but AA was speaking about the love of God and the love of God drives out all fear and when fear is it's a sign that love is missing remember that in your life when there's a fear in your life and we are coming in situation where there's fear in but when the love of God says in your life when you look to the cross and you say it was his love for me it drives out all [Applause] fear maybe in Simplicity tonight fear is driven out he said fear not I will with you peace be unto you as my father sent me so send I you the presence of Charity was missing so they en closed themselves in the house but one day Jesus was coming back again there were two disciples they were Disturbed they were confused and they said we must go out we must take a walk and sometimes we feel like we must go perhaps in nature I must take a walk and on the way Jesus is coming and Jesus is telling him don't you know the scripture am and in his presence a peace starts coming down Jehovah Shalom I'll be with you always but it took till the evening that they recognized him by the way he broke the bread now the stone was rolled away on a Sunday on the third day the stone was rolled away that's when he met the disciples and they didn't knew that Jesus was resurrected praise they still saw Jesus was absent and there was somebody else praise the Lord a disciple a strong one and in the absence of Christ he said I have my own will and if we have our own will Jesus let us go and he said I have my own will I said I have my will Jesus is not there I said I go fishing was Peter he was always Brave he said Jesus not there is that something he forgot that Jesus said in three days Peter and the Bible says they were fishing and the Bible says they were fishing all night and he was asking some other disciples don't you want to come with me and some other disciples says Jesus is not not there yes okay we go fishing too Jesus is not there they wanted to have a harvest but Jesus was not there they fished nothing nothing was finished now Peter was Brave by the hour came amen but his presence dropped down rbie was back in the house in his presence they recognized Jesus was standing on the shore and he cried out to him have you something they say we have fished the whole night and they said there's nothing Hallelujah now Jesus is revealing himself he said cast your net on the other side and brother PR said right there fishes were created in the presence of God [Applause] and when they saw that Peter he was naked he closed himself in the presence of God and he jumped in the water and we recognize Jesus was coming in the morning doesn't the song say he's coming back in the morning he's coming back for me he's coming back for you oh when that bright morning Shar When The Morning Sun arises in your life when the sun of righteousness Rises upon your life praise the Lord the presence the presence of God is dropping down in your [Applause] life praise the Lord praise the Lord and therefore praise the Lord he cast your net on the right side and you shall find and they cast therefore upon his word and they were able not to draw the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said unto Peter it is the Lord am hallelujah hallelujah what did he said he said Peter the absence is over he said Peter rabbie is back John recognized him praise the Lord and he got his Fisher coat and as soon as they were come to the land they saw fire of colds here and fish lay there and bread and Jesus said come and dine [Applause] tonight the master is here he has prepared some fish he has prepared some meat it's ready to eat it says come and D rabie is in the house the master is here the seals are broken as I have descended I come again did he come again and the bride thought he was absent and he's here hallelu tabl spread wide final absence and you can put up the next picture there was another absence Jesus had to take and that's a scripture he said let not your heart be troubled believe in God I have to go and I will prepare a mansion He said I will be absent for you but there was a difference now in this absence for the disciples now in this absence the disciples were trained praise the Lord they knew the absence has a beginning and they knew the absence has an end they were not ignorant ignorant and unlearned praise the Lord they have become adults praise the Lord and Jesus said I go in prepared place and I come again and receive you unto myself where I go where I am that you may be also he said I go but I come again and the disciples knew when he go he will come again he will come in the form of the comforter he has to go that he can come again now this time when he comes again he comes in a different way he comes as the comforter he comes as the guideall he comes as the Holy Spirit he comes as the spirit of Truth and a time of absence has a beginning and it has an end and Jesus told him go to Jerusalem and Terry Terry for a time and the Terry has a beginning and an end but when the time of Terry has an end the comforter is back again he said I come back again the spirit of Truth is coming back again after a short time perhaps after a half an hour it says I come back again The Headstone charity is coming back again but the disciples were trained and with great joy this time with great joy this time not self this time no reasoning the storm was raging Jesus was gone no more miracles no more healings but this time they were not in trouble this time with great joy they went to Jerusalem they went in the upper room that Jesus told me Terry we have learned the lesson the absence has a beginning and the absence has an end and they started to rejoicing they started to praising God they started worshiping God praise the Lord as some people under the seven seal they start rejoicing they start dancing they s is coming back the fullness is coming back it's already operating in me we have the word of God we have the word of assurance we have a better word of Prophecy and they were rejoicing praise the Lord they rejoice hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord

together praise the Lord where the absence has an [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] end praise the Lord they were thanking him because brother says because they knew the seed was in their heart praise the Lord Lord praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord now when he was coming back praise the Lord now he's coming back he's coming back they fear they hear the rushing in the mberry tree there had something is going on there had some rushing of winds something is moving something is changing this presence I know this Jesus I know but he's coming now in a different form he said you shall receive the Holy Ghost ter in Jerusalem and suddenly a licks of fire came down from heaven the presence of God came down to them praise the Lord and the Bible says it filled all the house it didn't left one out praise the Lord praise the Lord L praise the Lord and brother BR says what did it do s it transformed them there was a transformation and yesterday we heard about a transfusion of life and a transformation set in in the upper room from fishes to fisher of men from men and woman of the street praise the Lord from man and woman on the street from man and woman off the street in all kinds of ways found but when the presence of God comes down when the presence of God drops down on a sinner when he repents a transformation starts it transforms life praise the Lord be encouraged
