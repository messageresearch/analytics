come and have the preeminence is Lord come and have the oversight this morning in Jesus name we ask it may God bless you before I take a seat I let you to read a scripture Judges 3 verse 31 just one verse and after him was Shamar the son of anath which slew of the Philistine 600 men with an ox gold he also delivered Israel may God bless his Bo you may be seated oh praise God so this morning we have a special tape we like to share with you brother Isaac and all things are possible Sunday like to share with you title of the message is the inheritance of the Overcomers but before that I wanted to to read about this uh brother Gideon Struck it on Wednesday night about Shamar and it's just two verses in the scriptures I believe mentioned Sha's name and what I wanted to show is that not because it look look like he's not like Joshua or a big name like Moses or whatnot that he as a person might be insignificant but not his fith faith is never insignificant so I don't care how small people want to I know it's not a word SMY f you will belittle you or whatever but your faith is is powerful your faith is counted your faith is significant I don't care if nobody recognizes you nobody acknowledge you nobody see you nobody Shake Your Hand That Faith inside of you that is what God looking at this morning so but brandham said this I seen a there judges a little old fellow named shamba it's found over in the Book of Judges and the Philistines would come in and take off everything they had every time they raise a crop the Philistines would come in and get what they taken off that come like somebody rubbing you every time they get a breakthrough something kind of hit your back the Philistines keep coming back they coming back they're not giving you a chance anytime you feel have a a a week breakthrough a month breakthrough here come them Philistines again to take away your joy to rub you of your amen Your Enthusiasm and your Zeal and you have to understand that shanga became defiant in other words he had enough and you have to come to the place where you become defiant but you have enough enough of your sickness enough of your frustration enough of depression enough of whatever attacking you you say that's enough I had enough I'm not sitting down taking blows anymore I'm not taking down and taking licks from the Philistines anymore I had enough time for my breakthrough time for my Deliverance time for my victory time for me to overcome oh give the Lord some Praises because God going to have a bunch of Overcomers in these last days hallelujah are you with me now Okay so watch this Hallelujah he said and robbing them just like it is today but every time you get your church built up first thing you know somebody comes along and say oh there a miracle pass about some about that time the body begins and begin to feel a moving of the spirit and you're getting a little better somebody said no that's just psychology you're not any better that's the old devil that's coming in to rupt you when you have your faith place in God leave it there don't let the devil come and tell you anything in your mind well you know Sant you know God but love me so much the devil is a liar every time you open his mouth there lies coming out his mouth believe what God said to you this morning and these Philistines about the time of Israel didn't have any Kingdom and just about that time they get all their crops all rais and harvest all the hard work done it would come the there come the Philistines they would take what they had and go back and they sta to death so one day this little old fellow by the name of shanga stood out there I just like that little guy he was standing there in the barn he said well I suppose maybe we'll have enough grain to feed the whole family this year he happened to listen Trump Trump trump up the road come down 600 Philistines all in armor big Spears Trump Trump trump coming to get the crop my all the Harvest all after trying after all the effort here comes 600 armed Philistines to take away what he had I see him look down at his little old wife her ragged sleeve about naked he looked at his little children their faces were pale sta to death and these big old husky Philistines come in to take what they got they show sta through the winter it's about that little church today brother pale anemia we need is the courage and the word of God to stand out there and let them old rubbers come and run them away now shamba said now look here I know I'm not a warrior I can't fight there's 600 men what am I going to do I can see him Pace back and forth he didn't know what to do coming closer Trump trump Trump trump a few minutes all of our oats will be gone all the wheat and corn will be gone everything he had laid up his family would be stabed everything he had would be done taken off into a big enemy country and given to the enemy then the first thing you know God begin to move on him I like that he began to get angry so when God bless you Philistines you can't go with a smile with this thing it's Waring so that man got angry who was moving on him God so God could make it get angry angry at sin angry at sickness angry at unbelief angry at depression angry at frustration angry how the home is how the family is the spirit in the home the atmosphere in the home you have to get angry angry with you oh

his faith was that significant praise God is a reflection that you could get to that Spirit of defiance to defy the devil the Bible say resist the devil and he shall not walk away he shall flee from

here one more time in the house of the Lord and before uh we take our seats let's just read two portions of scripture we're going to read one verse that we read last night uh from Ephesians uh one we're going to read Ephesians 1 verse 11 and we're going to read from Revelation 3 from verse 20 verse 20 Ephesians 1:1 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and reading from Revelation chapter 3 and reading from verse uh 20 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear with his Spirit sayth unto the churches amen may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so certainly want to greet you one more time in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's certainly a great privilege to be among you I really want to salute brother stephanus and his wife and the church for the invitation to be here to brother Johnny and the ministry and the cola family all the churches that are here the ministers that are here all of the specials the music the hospitality the atmosphere there is no meeting without you and once you are here and once God is here then all things are possible because I believe God could use anybody can the church say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord I greet you one more time uh from The Headstone Tabernacle from Theo ID and The Headstone Tabernacle Ministry they send their love and greetings and we are so happy to be identified with Believers of like Precious Faith certainly want to greet all those connected online and we pray that this morning something that will be said to encourage you along the journey can the church say Amen so for a title this morning the inheritance of the Overcomers the inheritance of the Overcomers so there are two things in there we are speaking to Overcomers because you are born to overcome and you're not just overcoming to say that you're an overcomer but you are overcoming and there's a reward for overcoming and that reward is your inheritance so we are speaking about the inheritance of the Overcomers can the church say amen and brother brandham told us Hallelujah that you got to have something to overcome just to be here this morning you had to overcome you had to overcome your bed to get up this morning you had to overcome the driving to come to church this morning life is about overcoming you had to overcome maybe you felt tired but you had to overcome that you had to overcome your feelings sometimes you don't feel good sometimes you feel like giving up but because you are an overcomer you overcome your feelings you overcome your thoughts you overcome your ideas you overcome what the devil says you overcome your past you overcome your mistakes and here you are this morning a testimony I that you're an overcomer you can't help yourself because overcoming is built into you it's a part of you you were born to overcome can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so you're an overcomer and you have an inheritance Hallelujah God always knew that there would be promises for Overcomers Adam did not have anything to overcome so he could not have claimed a reward because he didn't have to overcome can the church say Amen Adam had no trials Adam had no testings Adam had no mistakes he had no problems he didn't have issues in his home he didn't have issues on his job because he was a perfect man but when man fell he had something to overcome can the church say Amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord what are you saying God has created situations for you to be an overcomer brother brandham said when speaking about adoption he said he could turn your wife against you he could turn the church against you he said I stomped him what is he doing he is looking for Overcomers you could overcome anything and you could stand alone there's no group overcoming you overcome as an individual you overcome as an individual if nobody else wants to worship you worship because you an overcomer if no one else want to believe you believe because you're an overcomer can the church say Amen oh [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah in the Bible it says over and over in the Book of Revelation to him that overcometh to him not overcome it to him not overcome it you've got to have something to overcome you have to overcome that's how you have a victory you cannot have a victory unless you have a battle so thank God that you're in a battle oh can the Church Say Amen church if you're not in a battle this morning you should be very worried can the church say Amen if all hell is not against you you should be very worried because there's a seed in your soul brother brandham said you are not the believer but the seed in there that seed is the believer and everywhere you go the devil is seeing that seed there's a light over you when you woke up this morning that light was over you it's connected to the seed and that seed is going to bring forth after its kind there is nothing nothing P nothing present nothing to come that will stop you you an Overcomer false Doctrine could not keep you back what happened in the past couldn't keep you back your mistakes could not keep you back what people said about you could not keep you back can the church say Amen born to overcome you're an overcomer you may be seated it's built into you you are walking today you walked into the house today but when you are a baby you couldn't walk you creeped for a while you maybe stood up a little bit and you fell back down but no baby has ever stayed down when they fell back down it's built into them nobody has to tell a baby try again it's built into them they know that they are born to walk they know that creeping is temporary they know that they are born to speak when they are baby they are not speaking yet but the moment they see their mama speaking something in them tell tells them I'm going to do it too and something in US tells us we are going to be like him we have seen our father we have seen our names we have seen who we are and the devil cannot change it [Applause] Hallelujah you may be seated it's too late devil we have seen too much this message is too real we have seen too much we have believed for too long I might have my UPS I might have my downs but the seed in me that seed of predestination is bigger than your problem the seed in you is more powerful than your situation the seed in you is bigger than your trial the seed in you is bigger than the devil greater is he that's in you than he that's in the [Applause] world you may be seated Revelation 3 verse 5 to him that over overcometh not to him that comes to church not to him that's in the message not to him that read the books not to him that listen to the tapes but to him that overcome it to him that overcome the internet to him that overcome gossip for him that overcome lust him that overcome lying him that overcome backbiting to him not overcome it the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels can the church say Amen this is the mighty Angel the Lord himself he is looking for one person who is willing to overcome everything you may be seated so I'm not preaching to church members this morning I'm not preaching to message Believers the Bible tells me to him that overcometh I'm preaching to Overcomers I'm looking at Overcomers I'm watching Overcomers you know the devil is [Applause] afraid there's more power in your little finger than what the devil [Applause] has the Bible says you are more than conquerors friends it is a comfort to know that the Bible could say I'm a conqueror but the Bible doesn't say that it says you are more than conquerors not just conquerors you are more than conquerors when you sleep at night you a conqueror you wake up in the morning you're a conqueror can the church say [Applause] Amen from the message how can I overcome brother brandham said you've got to have something to overcome and what and what I might need to overcome would be different from what you need to overcome but we are all Overcomers what might bother you may not affect your sister but God could still say you are an overcomer your trial may not be my trial your test may not be my test but every one of us will go through a test and will be tested and we'll be tested and friends when you're in school to go to the next class the next level you have to pass the testest from one level to go to the higher level you've got to pass the test from high school to go into University when you're in University they're not going to give you a high school test can the church say Amen because you already did that when you're in University you supposed to get a University test and we are in the final age this is the last age there's no other age this is the highest University brother brandham is waiting on us the sleeping Saints are are waiting on us so we have some big tests because when we pass this test there's coming power there's a power that's coming to the Overcomers can the church say Amen you may be seated no wonder the prophet preach that power without character is satanic because God wants to make sure that when he gives you power you could handle it could you imagine if God give you power 10 years ago 15 years ago for some of you five years ago you knew how you were 5 years ago you knew how you were 10 years ago but all of our experiences all of the tests and trials has brought us to this spot because you're gonna have a final test you're GNA have a final test can the church say Amen you remember the prophet when that couple came into the Tabernacle that was a test for the prophet the Lord told the prophet whatever you say if you say blindness whatever it is and what did the prophet do he had the power to speak any but something in him maybe realized it was a test and he said I forgive you Hallelujah for many of us we preach about overcoming and it's not a physical thing for some of us it's just to say I'm sorry for some it's just to say I forgive you for some to say I love you and you overcome yourself you overcome your feelings you overcome what you're going through can the church say [Applause] Amen brother brandham goes on in that in that message brother mam said this call is not to the church he said it's he that overcome it the individual that will overcome friends as a Believer you must be able to stand alone if nobody else is standing with you God has never called out groups but from in the groups there's one over there there's one over there that's the Overcomer because overcoming keeps life in you come the Church Say Amen [Applause] notice overcome with the brandham said the god that's in you is greater than the one that's in him the God of this world is not as great as the god of Heaven Darkness cannot stand in the presence of light brother Bram said I don't care how dark it is light will put it out can the Church Say Amen Glory he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches the spirit the Holy Spirit spoke in every age and that same holy spirit is speaking in every service that same voice the voice of the Archangel the voice of power is speaking to Overcomers speaking to the seed because this flesh is trouble but the seed in you is built to overcome we need to bring our bodies under subjection to obey our confession from the word seed because when you're in the right atmosphere the seed can only do one thing reproduce itself so take courage because you could not even be here unless there's a seed in you do you know how difficult it is for someone to just walk into this you canot just walk into the message it takes God to call you one in a million one in a million you don't just walk into this thing if God did not predestinate you you could never see it and if you see this message you should thank God that he put your name in the book and he made a way for you oh [Music] hallelujah what a joy to know that almighty God before there was a world before there was a trial you were on his mind and he knew based on for knowledge that nothing will take you away from this can the church say Amen many people walked away but here you are still an overcomer Still Standing you might be tired but you're still standing you may have been here for a long time but you're still standing come to church say Amen you may be seated brother Henry good to see you God bless you friends Caleb can we talk about Caleb a little bit Caleb was one of the 12 men who was identified to go and see if the land was a good land can the church say Amen Redemption is in two parts it's coming out of and going into so they were shouting and rejoicing because they came out of Egypt but God didn't bring them out of Egypt to have them circling he wanted these Overcomers to have an inheritance and they came to a crossroad where they say we got to send some people over to see if this land we heard about if it is as good as they say it is we have heard the preaching for many years that there's a Promised Land but we haven't met anyone who has actually been there so they got some brothers they got 12 Brothers one from each tribe can the church say Amen when the tribe of Judah came and they had to pick one brother they picked a brother named brother Caleb brother Caleb was special because brother Caleb was not even born in the tribe of Judah do you know that Caleb the Bible said was a kenite Caleb was a gentile who was adopted into the tribe of Judah he was the first Gentile Warrior read the Bible Caleb was a type of this Bride As a gentile bride getting to eat of the same land that was promised to Abraham can the church say amen and those Brothers they were all Overcomers up until that point but when they went into the land 10 of them they looked around and they saw the Giants they didn't talk to the Giants they didn't interview the Giants they stood in the mountain maybe with some with some binoculars because the Bible says they said to themselves we are grasshoppers the Giants didn't tell them that you are grasshoppers they did an analysis and the conclusion of their analysis is is we are grasshoppers can the church say amen and these 10 men went back and brought a report it's too hard we cannot win too many Giants too much problems people have backslid some people don't believe we don't know how long it's going to be they had every excuse Caleb and Joshua they didn't go back with them because they were eating grapes they were eating the honey they were eating the food Caleb's clothes was grape juice ju Joshua's clothes was grape juice the land was a good land they came back late and they say we are more than able let us go up at once let us go now we can take the land you may be seated I want to encourage you we know the story because of unbelief do you know the Bible said that when Caleb and Joshua said we could take the land the people were so discouraged the Bible said they wanted to Stone them and because of unbelief they did not enter into the land and Caleb and Joshua had to walk around with these people until that whole generation died out can the church say Amen Caleb did not doubt Caleb always believed but he had to pay the price of the unbelief of the rest of the people friends it wasn't easy for Caleb think about it he always believed he was a True Believer and he had to walk in the wilderness with everybody else because everyone did not believe can you are you with me Caleb had every reason to have arts and grudges he had every reason because he tasted the land it took him 45 years to come back to the land when he told Joshua you know the promise that was given to me about that mountain now therefore give me this mountain he say I'm still a strong as I was 45 years ago I'm not ready to give up now that's why I say Church many of you have been here a long time maybe like Caleb you believed for a long time don't give up the promised land is in view we are looking at it today now therefore give me this mountain can the Church Say Amen come on you [Applause] [Applause] Overcomers in the message the spanian church age brother brandham says he in the lean church that overcomes what he said overcomes the nians overcome the things of the world overcome these denominations overcome these priesthoods priesthoods priesthoods overcome everything of the world and sells out and loves Christ that's who he's talking about can the church say Amen born to overcome we said this last night you overcame Lucifer when Michael drew his sword you drew your sword when Michael attacked when Michael overcame you overcame when you were born your birth certificate had overcome a written on it that's why everywhere you go you are a threat to the devil's Kingdom and the devil understands this that's why more than once in scripture he said kill the babies because he knew that if these babies grow up what they will become and the devil has tried to kill you a long time ago but too late devil too late too late devil we are still standing in 2025 you can't stop us now we know who we are we know who God is we know who the devil is we know where we going you cannot stop us now can the church say amen and now when we need it the spirit is raising a standard my taking the same word brother brandham said and making that word more positive can the church say Amen Revelation 3:12 him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God in other words young people there's no more backsliding he said I'll make a pillar you can't just move a pillar these pillars in this building you just shake it away he said him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out in other words you can't backslide no more you are rooted you are grounded nothing could shake you the wind could blow but you're still standing others could walk away but you're still standing because God placed [Applause] you amen and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name can the church say Amen Revelation 3:21 to him that overcometh I want you to see these are your promises will I grant to sit with me in my Throne isn't that a Harmony sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame so Jesus is saying as I overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne so overcoming puts you in position to sit upon a throne can the church say Amen Revelation 2 verse1 17 he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Manner and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saying he that receiveth it it's an individual Affair just for the Overcomers Again Church this is not for those who attend services this is not for the make believer this is not for the unbeliever this is for the True Believer who overcomes Revelation [Music] 2:7 he that in here let them hear what the spirit say unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the paradise of God that's only for the Overcomers Hallelujah Revelation 217 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son so only the Overcomers get to taste the inheritance come on you Overcomers our inheritance is close at hand Oh Glory so you'll see when you look at the scriptures every Church age had its identification of what was for the Overcomers now in this last day all of these promises are gathered for us all of the overcoming power all that is Promised in our season and time every promise wrapped up for the Overcomers of this age can the church say Amen what a glorious time to be in we are living in the best time we are living in the greatest time it's the greatest time for the believer it's the worst time for the world but it's the greatest time for the believer arise and shine for your light has come gross Darkness over the Earth but you are shining in the [Applause] darkness Amen to him that overcome it you may be seated in the message how can I overcome brother brandom said even in that worldly Wicked Church age that overcometh so it doesn't matter parents how bad the schools get what they teach our children now they would have never talked about years ago it's evil everywhere Satan is everywhere we are living in Sodom but in the midst of Sodom there is going to be Overcomers in the midst of evil there's going to be Overcomers we said it last night the devil could have most but he cannot have all I believe I'm speaking to Overcomers today Glory but the brandom goes on we find here that God has always had Overcomers he has had Overcomers in every age there's always every time in every age that there's been on the earth God has always had somebody he could put his hands on as a witness on the earth he has never been without a witness though sometimes just one but somebody overcome so maybe you are the only one in your neighborhood maybe you are the only one in your family maybe you are the only one in your home God will have a witness God will have somebody who will stand up for him can the church say Amen oh [Applause] Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory brother bam said in the days of Daniel there was four Overcomers there were four four Overcomers that could stand the test of fire and the lion I just want to make sure we have it because many people believe that coming into the Lord It's supposed to be an easy Journey we serve a great God and many people believe that we're not supposed to have trials and we're not supposed to have problems and everything is supposed to work out fine the Bible said all things work together for good but that's at the end of it through the process God will take you through trials so the earlier you get comfortable with trials and testings is the better you'll be it's easier for you to know there's another trial coming there's another test coming but God promised to never give us more than we could bear there's no trial that could ever come your way that you do not have the strength to overcome brother brandham said we are expected to be tested he that cometh to God must first be tested that shows a true child you heard that so being tested shows you a true child so take courage in the midst of your test friends when brother the Brandon preach an adoption and said he could turn the church against you does anyone want to volunteer for that you want to volunteer I don't think anyone wants to volunteer for a bigger trial no one wants to volunteer when brother brandham said missing limbs will be restored no one wants to volunteer to lose a li to fulfill that quote no one chooses to hard a trial it's it's it's not normal our nature is to choose the easier way if there's traffic on the road and this other road is clear no one looks at the traffic and looks at the clear Road and says I'm choosing traffic our nature will choose the EAS your road isn't that right most people on their jobs if the boss says I have a hard job and I have an easy job line up for who wants a hard job and who wants the easy job I can guarantee you're going to have a long line for those who want the easy job and maybe a short line on no line for the hard job it's not our nature to choose the hard thing but with our Prophet God could tell the prophet because thou has chosen the hard way can the church say Amen you chose the way of persecution you chose the way of rejection you chose the way of standing alone because thou has chosen so only the True Believers could choose the hard away because they know that they are Overcomers can the church say Amen you may be seated so young people don't get discouraged don't give into the peer pressure in the school it doesn't matter what's happening now it doesn't matter what they wear where they go what they listen to what they talk about if it's cool or it's not cool if everybody is doing it if you are the only one who's not going that's okay it's better to stand alone and be named with the Overcomers than to go with everybody else we are swimming Upstream all hell is against us but come on you're going to make it keep on swimming Keep On Believing keep on coming it's too late to backslide now it's too late to give up now can the church say Amen brother brandham goes on when the test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not to him that overcometh the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you could I say that one more time the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to to you when somebody lies about you and you know you're right and you have to forgive it's one thing if you're wrong but when you are right and people talk about you and because the reality is God Is Not testing them he is testing you can the church say Amen it's about you coming to maturity it is about your character being formed into the word image can the church say Amen brother brandham goes on he said Peter said our trials are worth more to us than precious gold you know it's easy to thank God for the good things but when last when last have you thanked God for the trials when last have you thank God for taking you through experiences that he in his wisdom have sent your away friends when certain doors don't open and you say it's a trial you don't know what God is protecting you from there are many things we want and we go to God and we say Lord I want this and I want this bless me with this bless me with this and God sees way down the road that if you get that thing you'll get in trouble and God closes the door and God point you somewhere else and we sometimes we don't thank God enough for closing doors we thank God for opening doors when we read the notes of Praise in church thank God for a new job thank God for healing thank God and that's the notes of Praise there are very few notes of Praises that say thank God because I lost the job you don't hear me this morning because many times God makes you lose the job to find him oh you don't hear me this [Applause] morning that's why the Bible says in everything give him [Applause] thanks I want this to help you Church you may be seated because it's easy to come to church and see the promises and to see the word and to see your name and to catch a revelation but the reality is we have to go to work on Monday deal with family issues on Tuesday deal with a bill on Wednesday visit the doctor on Thursday and talk to the neighbor who doesn't like us on Friday and that's about putting the word to the test because the word is not just information it is to change us so we could deal with the issues of Life can the church say Amen you may be seated this message didn't come for us to have church services it came to change our life so we could live better not just with those who we like but to live like Jesus love your enemies do good to them that hurt you speak good to them that speak evil about you the word still says turn the other cheek that's still the word can the church say Amen you love him this [Applause] morning we are born to overcome there are many of us we talk very nicely to the people in our jobs and we don't even treat the people in our homes the same way maybe that doesn't happen in Europe maybe that's just in my country but it's easy to treat people who are away from you nice and you disrespect your parents you talk terrible to your brother your sister you come to church and you can't hear anything because you don't like the seat they put you in simple things and all of these things are for you to overcome yourself there are people who can't sit in church because they want to sing a song and the Pastor said not today they heard nothing after that they sat in church for the whole service and they still don't know what was preached because in their heart they want to sing a song and God wants you to live beyond that not caught up in emotions this brother didn't shake my hand this sister didn't shake my hand this person said this this person did that friends overcoming it's not just overcoming sin it's it's easy to see when someone overcomes dressing right you wear your skirt the right way you don't cut your hair you don't go to the club you don't drink out alcohol but that's one kind of overcoming but many people have stuff on the inside that nobody sees and they haven't overcome that yet anybody with me this morning The Prodigal Son it would look like he was the one who was troubled he said Daddy I want everything that's mine everything you promised me I want it now the credit card the car the bike the money everything and the Bible said his father gave him everything and he went to a far away land and he lived for a while until his money ran out and when his money ran out he found himself working for someone raising pigs and as a Jew you don't work with pigs what's worse he ended up eating the pig food so that's as low as you could go until he had to overcome himself he said wait a minute in My Father's House father's the servants eat better than this the servants live better than this I'm not even worthy to be called a son I will arise I will overcome my pride I will overcome my failure I will overcome my mistake I will overcome what people will say about me I will overcome what they say I'm a failure and I will go back he did not know that his father was always looking out for him can the church say amen and as this boy began to walk back home his father looking from a distance he said I know that walk it's far away but that looks like my boy he said prepare a party get my robe call the Family kill the fatted calf because my son my son who was lost is now back home you may be seated friends I'm not trying to talk about the prodigal son I'm really trying to talk about his brother who was in church the entire time he never went to the world he was in church every Sunday helping with everything nobody knew what was in his heart because he was always there but when his brother came back home and he heard heard the music and he smelled the food he said what's going on well they said your brother just came back what did they cook what's on the menu well they cooked rice snitzer and they cooked Cal he said he said SCF he said the fatted one he said the one I've been feeding the one I've been taken care of and you know what he stayed outside of the church his father had to go out to him and say why aren't you inside the church don't you know that your brother was lost and now is restored why are you bothered by the celebration for your brother being delivered in other words only when his brother was delivered showed the issues he had in his heart that he had to overcome so Church you have to to be able to rejoice when someone else is being blessed or you don't hear me this morning you must be able to rejoice when someone else is blessed you may be seated I don't know how I'm saying all of this this morning but you could be in a meeting in a convention and you see God dealing with someone and you could Wonder Lord why not me and you could actually end up with bitterness in your heart and you really can't Rejoice for them because you want it to be you there is nothing wrong with you wanting your blessing but you must be able to rejoice when God has delivered someone you must be able to rejoice when God has blessed someone it doesn't make you any less of a person when you rejoice when God blesses someone else can the church say [Applause] Amen you may be seated I don't know who that's for but I want us to see that overcoming is external it has to do with your environment it has to do with overcoming the world it has to do with internal overcoming yourself overcoming doubt overcoming jealousy overcoming hatred overcoming backbiting overcoming animosity things that are not easy to see overcoming what's happening in the church maybe you don't agree with everything but that's why you got to die out because maybe you're not seeing everything God puts a pastor in his place for a reason you can't see what the pastor sees can the church say Amen so God takes us through experiences to build character in US can the church say Amen oh can we give the Lord a hand of [Applause] Praise Glory the inheritance of the Overcomers job was tested he lost family he lost money he lost cattle everything and then his wife asked him why don't you curse God and die that was also a test and the Bible says he said he told his wife you speak like a foolish woman he didn't call her a foolish woman so you got to know you have to know how to speak but he had to overcome all of that and if he did not he would not be what the man he is or the man we preach about brother brandham said in speaking about Job brother brandham said he overcome what the neighbors had to say he overcome what all the church members Bild dad and all of them had to say he overcome the bishop and what he had to say he overcome the Cardinal and what he had to say he overcome the denomination and what they had to say and he stayed with the justification of the word it cost him everything he had even his children can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah so church as I find a place to wind down Noah had to overcome Abraham had to overcome David had to overcome Joshua had to overcome Paul had to overcome irenius had to overcome Martin had to overcome Columba had to overcome Luther Wesley they had to overcome brother brandham he had to overcome what about our day we also have to overcome can the church say Amen Oh [Applause] Glory even Jesus had to overcome when he was there in the wilderness wild the Devil Himself came to him to and Jesus had to overcome three wild attacks it is written it is written it is also written he overcame by the word listen friends even without the Holy Ghost yet the word is more powerful than anything the devil could bring your way oh can we say it one more time those of you who don't have the Holy Ghost yet the word itself is more powerful Jesus overcame by the word to prove to us that the word itself could defeat the Devil any place any time under any condition can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah you shall receive the Holy Ghost but until that time comes the word is your defense the word is your protection the word is your comfort the word of God will defeat the Devil any time any place under any condition [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah but brandom says overcome means to recognize the devil in in every one of his tricks I'm reading the prophet's words overcome is to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks oh Hallelujah you must recognize what the brandom said that the god in you is mightier than in the world Hallelujah Glory can the church say Amen trying to find a place to wind down brother brandham he lost his wife he lost his child he lost the anointing for 5 years brother brandham felt so low he even tried to commit suicide he struggled he contended he fought and he overcame we are born to overcome you are going to overcome every test every trial it is not promised to be easy but you are going to over over come he that overcometh all these worldly things but brandham said will sit with him in his throne and will go in the Rapture when he comes in other words the Rapture is only for Overcomers the Rapture is not for church members the Rapture is not for message Believers the Rapture is for Overcomers but said what should we care what the world says what should we care what anybody else says the great holy spirit is Among Us his Pillar of Fire leads us and guides us his word is Vindicated before us his love is in our hearts the world is in the back and we have passed from Death unto life Oh Glory [Applause] Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory from the message Revelation book of symbols God in this last days

seeing you on fire he is seeing you filled with the Holy Ghost your your situation is temporary but in God's mind you are an overcomer in God's mind you are on his throne in God's mind you are manifested Son of God give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] friends I'm trying to close forgive me I'm trying to close but something's keeping me I'm trying to close out friends what God sees and what we see two different things can the Church Say Amen what we see and what God sees two different things when the Apostle Paul was Saul the world the church they saw him persecuting the church God was looking at the same man and when God saw him he saw a star in the right hand of God the world was seeing him one way and God was seeing him another way oh you don't hear me this morning church don't look at your present situation don't look at the situation of your children don't look at the situation of the church it does not matter what it looks like God has a vision and that Vision must

prophetic Vision we could not be here unless God gave the prophet the word say sweet the words to speak Church you're overcoming it's not based on your strength your overcoming is not based on your
