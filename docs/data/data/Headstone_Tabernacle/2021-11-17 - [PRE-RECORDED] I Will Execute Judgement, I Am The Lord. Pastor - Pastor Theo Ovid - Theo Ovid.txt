email god bless you and thank you for coming and welcome if you have a bibles i'd like you to turn to exodus chapter 12 and revelation chapter 22 for scripture reading this morning exodus chapter 12 ordinary from verse 1 to 13 and the lord speak under moses and aaron the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking unto the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of the month they shall take to them every man alarm according to the house of the father's lamb for his house verse 5 your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out of the sheep or from the goats and let's go to verse seven and they shall take the blood and strike it on the on the two side posts and on the upper doorposts of the houses wherein they shall eat it they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat none of it raw no sadness with water but rose would fire his head with his legs with the puritans thereof and he shall let nothing of it remain until the morning that which remain out of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins grated your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand you shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and which smite all the first born in the land of egypt both man and beast against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord the blood shall be to you for talking upon the hoses where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt as we go to the book of revelation reading from verse 22 russian chapter 22 reading for verse 10. and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he doesn't just let him be unjust still he will just filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be i'm alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are the day that do his commandments that they may have right to a tree of life and may enter into the gates into the city for without a dogs and sorcerers and humongous and murderers and idolaters and whosoever love it and make it a lie i jesus i've sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come let him not hear it say come let him as the tears come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely for i testify unto every man that hear the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things that are written in this book he that which testified these things said surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus may god bless you well let's pray one more time father we thank you for the scriptures that have been read and we pray come and interpret into our hearts and lord move upon the hearts and lives of the people that there will be change all together after this service granted lord in jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated praise god it's always good to be in the house of the lord it's always good to be where you could come to hear from god and if you change your mindset instead of coming to church you're coming to hear from god you would listen and you would receive direct from god so this morning our title uh i will execute judgment i am the lord took that from the scripture i will execute judgment i am the lord subject the token has to be displayed inspiration no free pass no shortcuts god's requirement must be met i want to read it again no free pass no shortcuts god requirement must be met the even time message is to apply the token so you want to go straight in the word are you ready just to come here to receive and to heal and to be edified and to be strengthened and to be built up amen we not come here to entertain you we come here because we believe that we have something to say to you from the lord amen i just backtrack a little bit from last week you come like adam like me whatever i'm speaking you become from attribute to flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if our earthly nam tamnaka be dissolved we have won already waiting now we don't have no permanent thing on this life here you know we only have a time slot whether it's the 70 80 90 100 that's all we have to leave here this flesh have to give up one day he told the man in the beginning dusto at the doctor shall return because he came from thus the first man was not the man the first man was the spirit man that was the first created image the first image wasn't dust man god make dust man and put spirit man in this man but the first created image was spirit man so you are not just flesh flesh you have to blow away the flesh no you were spirit man first and you have to come back to that where god can empower you in your spirit in your heart that you wouldn't walk after the flesh but you would walk after the spirit because the flesh has a law and the spirit have a law and if it yields in the law of the flesh you will do the things of the flesh but if you heal the law of the spirit you will do the thing of the spirit you come here to get empowered in your spirit all glory to god you ain't coming to anoint the flesh man you're committing on the spirit man because you're more than meet the eye you're more than flesh and blood there is something beyond your flesh there is something inside your soul that's what the word come to address oh glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah so we have never we listen we have never become the word we just become flesh man not the word because we come from taught the flesh so you walking on the earth you're not ordinary you come from thought to the flesh who could reveal that ghost in a prophet to reveal that we take for granted but that's a revelation that you was in the attribute mind of god you can be lost if you try praise god you come from god you're going back to god don't let the devil tie you up he was not there before the beginning he is not part of the attribute that was in god's mind he was created in the beginning with the rest of the angels when god created angels but you'd you may be seated but you see in order to stand temptation you have to bypass your teopony you have to come down here in the flesh to be tempted by sin so if you didn't bypass your theophany then you couldn't be kept you couldn't rethink that heal the sin whatsoever but god should have fall make you skip the word part but because you are the thought part of words that thought expressed that means the thought has to come to expression before you speak you have to think it so god was thinking about you and he put the thought in flesh and you was in county valley it wasn't dance it wasn't party he was in fact it was industrial but that just stopped the thought inside of there when time comes from that lord peter come and you come so you are paul come on now change my name that's what we talking about you are not you you are who god say you are my god my god listen but the man said you are the physical manifestation of the attribute that you are in god so in order to stand temptation you ought to bypass your theophany or your word body or your expression you have to come long in flesh to be tempted by sin and if you stand all the father of god will come so it went on to say further we track it last week that here is where you're formed in the word image and we said you are formed by what you go through that's what shapes you like we like to say this is a building here it was built but before it was a building it was con it was cement it was gravel it was bricks but it had to be formed into a building a man can have galvanized wall material that's not a building that's material where the material has to be built and that's the building well faith virtually is material all these things in the book is material that's why you're going to have to have a fightful ministry to put together the material because you are to be perfected faith faith knowledge temperance patience cognitive dc have to come into you it actually have to live in you [Applause] if jesus could live it you can live it because he was the first one first fruit of the resurrection first one manifested son of god [Music] he died listen listen to bring other sons yet die you just say jesus save me save me save me and i'm saved that is fine save in your heart right but we're not talking about saving your heart we talk about the display of the token [Music] what you have on the inside have to come out on the outside it has to be displayed because you say when i see the blood you can have the lamb the lamb inside the blood inside the lamb if you keep the lamb i know the blood because i have a whole lamb here lord look all the blood inside of it do you want to see blood inside lamb he said kill the lamb get the right kind of lamb hallelujah first are you with me then take that blood and put it on the doorpost two side posts on top put it there because i'm coming i will execute judgment i am the lord this is not moses speaking this is some pastor speaking this is god himself come down to tell them this what i have decreed no man can cancel it no man could stop it no man can block it i am coming on to execute judgment oh same as somebody and when i see the blood don't give me no talk when i see the blood don't tell me a box when i see the blood don't tell me there's player tips every day when i see the blood don't tell me what church you're going through when i see the blood don't tell me who your pastor is when i see the blood [Applause] i don't want to hear that i want to see the blood i'm thinking about those i don't want to hear that i want to see the blood i don't know what gets rid of this i don't want i'm not interested in that when i see the blood you know what i'm going through i don't want to hear that when i see the blood under pressure that is irrelevant when i see the blood i blossom 40 years i don't want to hear that when i feed the blood i became your passion i don't care if you whatever happened last night last year i don't care when i see the blood god require blood oh glory to god amen [Music] [Applause] they want a shortcut to heaven hallelujah hallelujah i got on the elijah's garment i'm going out tomorrow to castle hallelujah praise god they want the shortcut to heaven taking as much of the world as they can take you can't take any of it there are no shortcuts you come the way of calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the brazen serpent you die you actually die you literally die to yourself and die to the kings of the world and be born anew and the world is dead there are no shortcuts because they want to come right quick they don't want to grow we grow in the lord that's how when patients hit your good you have to be patient with the lord and be patient with yourself because if you're not patient with yourself you'll get enticed by some fast food spirit that tells you this shortcut will get you where you're going real fast you don't need that you need to grow in god you see when we say we want to get closer to god what we are actually saying i want to grow in god so you grow from faith to virtue you're still growing the knowledge you're still going temperance you're getting closer patience godliness brotherly kindness and you break into the spirit you can't get closer than that after that i am my father and one you ain't getting closer no more you're one with the father now when you see me you see the father you've got the father start to ooze out now he's the immediate virtue power started leaked out from your being oh glory to god that is what the disciples had they had power resident power permanent power not temporary power so what you're looking for is that a temporary blessing to keep you for the weak you want permanent power watch watch watch to represent the [Music] kingdom because this power comes from a kingdom and you belong to a kingdom your father is the king and you are a son of the king they see you you are representative representative of the kingdom oh hallelujah my my my my man not he that starts it he either finishes i see people run some races there and there's problems because it's not a short distance race it's a long distance race sometime when i race somebody take off along the sun and take out the fast and they go and going going ahead afterwards the bun bun bun bun bun and a man who patiently in the rhythm of things patiently all right afterwards you see scrap heaps along the way although hustling all who figured they'd front all afraid to have more revelation than anybody else and they had the man in the hole and this is the own all kind of thing of the hour all of them falling one by one other side of the way and patience mr patience running running this race with patience the ways that they set before us knowing that he that stabbed the good work is able to complete it under the end and you're running with that determination you're running to achieve you're running to get to where you're going nobody just run just because you're running away when you're mad man or something just running crazy no you're not running crazy you have a goal you have a target you want to get there oh praise the name of the lord if you're doing college you're doing an exam you're doing a degree or whatever you have to run a certain way you can't waste all your time everybody are studying you you island and rhyming and everything else no you want to get there and you have a time to get there too always that time now press on brethren it's not here that starts here we go it's he that finishes there are no shortcuts you are disqualified at the end of the race so you can take one you know but then when the race come and they explain what the race is all about you say are you oh you get here so fast see disqualified when you're expecting that gold you have any game burns you're not on the podium at all there are no shortcuts there are no free pass for pastor pastor son pastor daughter elder elder son elder daughter there is no free pass it have no as is you come on now let me help you even on that because god is no respecter of persons oh give the lord some praises people god not even respected because you go that church that has nothing to do with it it's when i see the blood are we gonna come down to the talking hour and all god wanted yes talk and not talk talking not talk display not even the baptist holy ghost that's the circumcision of the heart you're not talking about that we're talking about the life added and coming forward a display of the life that's on the inside no excuses oh give the lord some praises people wait a minute by all this this thing want to live yes why you think wasn't a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the virus if peter could live it we could live it if andrew can live it we can live it if john can live it we can live it we have no excuses there were man just like us they're fussed just like us they were upset just like us they failed just like us but they lived it oh give the lord a shout the bible called elijah a man of like passion [Applause] sometimes we think that brothers like zombies you know like robots left turn right turn watch your hand so yeah right like they have no mind of their own it wasn't a robot one time i'm cheering teasing elijah and he kissed them and i bear come and killed them because mom says his word had to be honored he would have a prophet he was angry don't get them angry don't get these prophets angry their word becomes god's word they speak and the word is anointed just like that you understand the bible how powerful this anointing is and inspiration is when jacob went and dressed up because his mother gave instructions how to trick he saw to get the boot right mother knew he's a special child the mother was in on it and the mother said listen to whatever that fella now fellaini right here you know it's put right put right put right think about it make a song about it talk about it read it put the paper on there just visualize it that's yours brother hallelujah praise god and she was he was encouraged isn't that right and after jacob said oh god isaac are they saying you're feeling strange but how can i hear his skin on the man he's over the hairy man all kind of thing to these guys watch this watch this he was enabled by his mother for the right thing they are mothers and parents who enable the church for the wrong thing but that is namely for the right thing writing is a birthright and after isaac put all the blessing down and he saw come looking for his blessing he said i bless you already he said isn't there one more you mean you lose all right listen he can't come back and take it back you know you see when god lose a blessing on your life did you hear what i said you see when god lose a blessing upon your life no devil no family no necromancy no orbia no whatever no witch doctor no witchcraft could undo that change that cancer that what god has blessed is blessed what god bless is blessed oh hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah no shortcuts if you make a shortcut you'll be disqualified so i don't want to go into trouble down by the river no no i don't want to travel on my river i want to get wherever i go to let it start here when i go down the river must be clean slate amen enter into the joys of the lord clean slate no trouble here you have to check your visa are they checking they already belong here oh my hallelujah praise god remember remember remember but iran gave this story about the wedding and in those days the wedding the person who have the marriage and so on they provide the garment every so that man had to have garments he had 500 people gotta get fired up by the garment because everybody has to look the same and they get the garment at the door that means you have an invitation you present invitation you get your garment you have no invitation you have no garment to get and this man was found inside without the garment and when the king came and said friend he said no email hey are you dressed like that are you looking so different oh you're looking so early who are you oh you're not looking like all the rest of brethren i thought there's one faith one lord one baptism one fire one worship i thought i thought was what i thought was one you're supposed to be looking one you see when they have the one garment you don't know who richard and lupo you don't know who have you don't know who i have hallelujah and that's what the holy ghost make us and make us humble it make us one i don't care if you have one dress and somebody have ten dresses you are still one in christ isn't that right what did the man say pass them out hand them foot they shall be weeping and wearing a national teeth because of what barbara says he didn't come to the door that when he slipped through the window it was open and you take a chance and take a short cut what he should have done was kept the garment and then jumped through the window the only problem is the garment is on the front door so he couldn't get the gum he couldn't snatch one so you end up saying boy like an open boy nobody there no deacon no police go boy go something go for it go for it no dog master come out here so eating everybody else glasses sharing drinking like nobody else nobody bothered with that you know because he gonna be a silver and he could be anybody they don't know who he is there's many guests they have there is a man come out knowing all my guests supposed to have red orange yellow green indigo violet all my guests supposed to have seven colors oh my guess i'm looking for those seven colors how come that man don't have those colors out eagles no shortcuts not either start he that finishes many start the race but there is one finish in it there will be many churches start many groups of people but it'll be one group finish that's the overcomers and then he went on to define the overcomers not a group per se but individuals it's not to them that overcome it or the church body is he that overcome it so that group will be made up of individuals who are overcomers do you see yourself as an overcomer you have to begin to see yourself as overcomer you are going to take charge of your life oh glory to god and don't be a driftwood and let the stream of light just drift you along oh hallelujah praise god isn't that right thank you lord jesus okay here we go so israel was to gather together to apply the token because it was exodus you hear what i say it was leaving time and before you leave it have blood to apply because god going to execute judgment hallelujah against the world and the world system against egypt so god couldn't judge his people along with the egyptians he had to make a provision for them a way of escape and he bring that provision through the lamb which had the blood so you give instructions a family a house a lamb for a house if your house so too small join with somebody else but make sure everybody on the inside on the outside must be blood and i would recognize that blood as a token that i can touch once that bird is there i don't care who is under nothing can happen once they're under that blood hallelujah i don't care who it is jargon pull them in bed them in put them on your shoulder and walk them in get them in anyhow but get them under the blood because when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you if i don't see the blood i'm going to pass through i will execute judgment i am the lord oh give the lord some praises hallelujah so they came out to get together to apply the token and they had to have faith in that token that under that blood sacrifice that they would be under exodus out of egypt that was the second exodus and we are promised a third exodus the first exodus was a natural land into a natural land second a second after the exodus was a natural land into a spiritual baptism in the upper room but this exodus is from a spiritual baptism into the land of the millennium we are leaving here it's a rapture train to get you'd have a raptor express to pick up with oh glory to god amen hallelujah so the token was their sign of what god was going to do for them he was taking them up out of egypt oh praise god so the token what's a token a token is a sign that the price has been paid so when they go to get the bus ticket you don't have the driver the money you pay for the ticket and the driver takes the ticket the ticket is the token and that's i'm saying it now your car go and take that ticket and drive on a taxi and say listen taxi look look the ticket taxi will say wrong person wrong place we don't take those tickets you have to go to the bus isn't that right so that talking only we can sit in place so when god say that token he means that you have to get that token and when you get that talking to driver cardinal that's your right to board when the driver see that guys are not taking you this is my right this is paid for you have to take me on board i see merced already okay give the law some praises people that give you the right hallelujah you cannot be denied because you are paid a price it must be the blood so god made a token give it to israel no other token will work it cannot be recognized and you cannot have the token until the fair speed and then you are possessor of the token which give you the privilege of a free pass oh hallelujah what give you the free pass now the token so when you're passing just show your token they have to let you pass no talking you have to stop go and pay the price doesn't that sound familiar wise versions foolish versions hallelujah the first the white the foolish version had all you know but they all ran out the wise version of extra oil they wasn't taking no chances they wasn't wasting time in church killing a huge pew they want to receive and give extra they want to take in the word because the spirit prays god will only produce what the world has in it so the why is that extra oil and then when at midnight bridegroom behold the brandon come here go y'all to meet him he said my god give us some of your oil of course brotherly kindness [Applause] hold no oats now forgive me forgive me but i want some oil i have a diamond scene for everything if i give you both of our vehicles shopping both of us will be in the tribulation period what i have here to take me straight to glory straight to the rapture go and buy go quick and buy go to them that sell go on buy go and pay the price all the time you have opportunity to pay the price instead of staying on the video or playing on games or doing this and doing that you have a chance to pay the price go and pay the price now they never got it that means those people that were wise they're paying a price because they won't have extra oil let me stick a little bit baram say one day they're all going to run out the last drop in the bucket gonna run out because i have a time too it's not everlasting a whole bucket of oil in the oil stay in there no it's going to run out come on you wise virgins the kingdom of god is preached and every man press shout out press every man press their way into it you've got to get on fire for god oh glory some of you taking things for granted get on fire for god be hungry for god i am hungry for god i am thirsty for god i was scared to come to prison this morning because there's a there's a magnitude of this message here oh hallelujah praise god i will execute judgment i am the lord you're not asking how long are you preaching you're not asking about the sermon he's not asking that the token must be up on this [Applause] play when i see the blood possible it's nothing else can take its place no substitute no denomination no nothing else listen no matter how religious they was how good they was how much education they had how they dress the token was the only thing think about it no man people say he has to be this you'll press your hair they say this this had to be so long and they measured this and that and what can i legally say business what does that have to do with the token when i see the blood if that was the token then we have it if billing church for the token we have it if playing tapes in the church then everybody have it but that is not it the even time messages apply the token god has sent our message for us to say we have a message listen to it the message is something to apply [Applause] because what the message comes is to produce a manifestation [Music] [Applause] pharaoh where you come from kingdom the most high what they can let my people go when if you're looking for gifts for your word moses message was simple let my people go that was a word message to pharaoh no that was not talk you know wherever putting up blackboard let my people go messed with moses he got texts there was no text that was a word to obey if he was say obey are not obeying that but when message is a message come to get the man to act look fear can say okay that's god's weakened okay go go go it wasn't that way fair heart get hardened pharaoh playing hard and god want a right favor because god wanted this pharaoh he want to manage pharaoh because he was the biggest baddest thing in tongue and when god could bring along the biggest baddest everybody will fear god they recognize the god of israel easy he is the real god oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah so most of the jungle with frogs jamming with flies jamming with one in german and pharaoh gets so fed up he said take your frogs take your people and just go and i'm telling you when you start to jam in prayer jamming praise jamming consecration jamming dedication that devil is a run run from them the real serious about god i have to let you go i have to give up on you oh glory to god come on uk let's fight for your life glory to god hallelujah glory hallelujah be a war on pike there'll be a rusted pipe you never opened open up that pike man god you can't have said the lord be with me i shall be able to drive them out glory to god to let little gray hair keep your dog diet if you want to die but don't let that keep you down pull it out of your head if you want to pull it out but don't let that keep you down you are well able more than ever more than ever to be delivered more than ever to be set free more than able to get the victory more than ever to overcome you got to believe it [Applause] before it had the telephone it had them things we call it morse code some kind of talk thing and you had to cannot talk to talk four talks wasn't talk was talks [Music] what painful is this and you're writing down sorry i said yeah he means so he means he says somebody said this is crazy we gotta do better than that i feel i could do something on the good talk and i might believe it he was like a madman who could believe that they come from top talk doctor kitty ting and tong that he presented this man said i want to talk to her i want to talk [Applause] i want to talk talk i want to talk and he decided to press try to invent something to talk then there's a big big thing like big old horn you remember big thing like a cone so and one here and one here think about that i think you're working a little with something like that so but that is what they went through to have what you hear [Applause] then they had the cord you

go beyond the human go beyond eyes and ears and feelings and emotions you go beyond that you're committing yourself to the hands of god the hunger hell is after you but god wants to free you oh glory

it's not just dynamics coming judgment is coming glory to god and it will be cancelled [Applause] neither your blessings can be canceled oh glory to god hallelujah my my are you with me this morning the believing worshiper this is good what must was identified with his sacrifice by the token frankly he had to place his hands on it to identify several sacrifices so you're putting your hand on the lamb watch then the blood was placed to where he could stand under the blood all of that the blood must be over him and that was a token that he had identified himself guilty so watch this had to put your hands on your lamb and the priest killing the lamb is being killed and you could feel life leaving the lamb that represented you you were supposed to die but the animal taking your place he said take that blood blood is evidence the animal died take that blood and put it on a doorpost oh many people want to be christians they want to do it secretly so nobody would know they're christians they're associated they run around with some of them think well no i want to be a christian but i don't want someone to know about it that's not christianity christianity has to play display is token publicly in public life at the office on the street when troubles are wrong in the church anywhere else the blood is the token and the token must be applied or the covenant is not in effect okay now here is bomb here is bomb the brothers are talking identification identifying this person has been redeemed now they were redeemed before anything ever happened amen before judgment the blood means you are you see before it actually happened the blood was applied by faith you don't have to feel anything you applying by faith this blood to your loved ones to your family to your house you applying

believers though this when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over you oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you can't wait for things to happen and then so you're applying the blood you'll be doing like them in noah's day when the rain begin to fall they run into noah's ark and they're upon the north we receive it we believe it but the barriers of god shut the door and whatever god said though god shot no man can open whatever god though god shot no man can open don't let god shut the door coming now coming when you have time [Applause] they were supposed to come in

oh my god my listen to what the prophet said look now watch before the wrath of god passed through the land the blood had to be applied first it was too late after the wrath have done fallen amen i remember when the rat dropped i saw most of you was seeing ten commandments when it dropped it didn't drop on once on everybody you know it dropped in a certain place and start to move and as they move through house by house you're hearing screams people bawling those without blood pollen people dying because they're coming yes hallelujah and when them children in the house say daddy are you sure daddy are you sure because i hear people screaming out there are you sure when the father says son i am sure because moses told us to take the blood and put it in the dopples and i put it out there and god can't lie he said when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over you he's executing judgment tonight but my son that judgment can't touch us that judgment has to pass over us this is the passover for us because the blood is upon our house and when your blood is upon your house there's a passover for you because he's going to execute judgment he said i am the lord [Music] hallelujah glory to god amen the judge of all yet is on the earth oh glory to god remember you may be seated when them seven angels come from eternity my god the god asks the prophet are you looking at the picture the right way turning to the right or when he turned to the right saw this right that was the wig the wig is the wig of a judge so the judge is already here you heard what i said you heard what i said first thessalonians 4 the lord himself the judge descends with a shout he will execute judgment [Music] [Applause] playing time over [Applause] [Music] version 10 i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven with a book open that book flip to daniel and the books were open there's a book their books names church members that will receive eternal life at the white throne but the elected is in that book where seven thunders utter the voices to catch who the elect ninety percent of the ministers we checked the thunders [Applause] and but around preached it he says seven tunnels will cover the bride that's what he said seven ton getting my faith to leave here that's what he said seven terminal bad revival that's what he said and he rejected it they will pay for that [Music] they will pay for that rejection because what they don't understand but one says if this be so then faith is in virtue all these things then the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders so the seventh thunder is the stone the builders refuse there is nothing left for judgment hallelujah [Music] praise god therefore the seven thunders is the fullness of the atonement and that is what the church may reject oh glory to god the bride's going to make it because the bride becomes the word she accepts the fullness of the atonement fullness of the blood which is the token itself literal life of jesus christ i want nothing less than the literal life of jesus christ [Applause] [Music] i don't want to be a nice master nice minister i am not in that or glory to god i want a literal life [Applause] that's my promise [Applause] look look look this bum before it happens for there is coming a time when you will not be able to have any blood applied the blood was applied in the evening time the token never come into existence until the even time luther didn't have no talking the talking come in the evening time with the evening time message listen but this is the even time of the age we live in this is even time for the church this is even time for me this is the evening time of my message i am dying i am going i'm moving out we have come to justification but this is the time that the token has to be applied [Applause] the time when you can't play with it it's got to be done god's requirement must be met that's what i'm telling you don't look what anybody else does i don't care who do what you want the clip to hear who want to do this want the whiskers who want to wear pants we want to do this do what's that watch what god said in this world you apply the blood listen friends it's not a touch of fear [Applause] it's not a church of fear the bible doesn't say there'll be two churches one taking one left no two in the field two in a bed two there's two that one take and one layer it's the individual [Applause] why the animal christ didn't come yet he was the realm of god and the animal life couldn't come upon a human being when the blood left left the animal the life was gone from it it was a different life from the blood so the blood so god god accepted the chemistry of the blood that red physical thing that is what he accepted because the life of the animal couldn't come back but jesus he had a living soul in that right so when he died his soul his spirit could be released and come back upon the worshiper who identify with christ at calvary that's how you become born again because his spirit released to break into your spirit that's why he can offer you a new heart i will give you a new spirit i will give you and i'll put my spirit in your spirit [Applause] that's what he said could be giving us some praises [Applause] in this covenant today there's a difference between the blood and the life the token for the believer today is the holy ghost that's the token is the holy ghost not blood chemistry but the holy spirit of god that is the token that god requires of the church today god must see this token he must see it in every one of us oh glory to god he must see it in every one of us so i want you to get a burden for the token a burden for the holy ghost a burden to get your breakthrough you've got to get a burden here [Applause] therefore as the evil shadows appearing the rat is ready to reported from on high upon ungodlinations upon ungodly unbelievers upon listen professors without a possession so god don't want to be a professor without a possession go tell them there's a line from here to there to the other day all these years but every place you put your foot he's getting a whole description from here to there all about allah is yours but every place you put your foot is yours i'll be sorry you could take binoculars and spidey land from a distance what is his mind amongst these minds i feel less mine's here i claim it and jesus said hallelujah when you're gonna walk whenever walk on the land whenever i walk on your healing on your bridge when you gonna say i'm gonna take it i think will be no a watcher you know some

seal all those who sigh and cry for the abominations in the city all them all them who sign and crying those who have a burden i'll make you sigh and cry not for you so much you know but for the things are wrong you're burdened you're burdened hallelujah if i finish today next sunday i'll continue right now on a channel and oh praise the name of the lord and i'm burdened with what i'm seeing right now i find it to be scary i find it to be shaken what i am seeing right now in this world right now it is shaken to me [Applause] hallelujah i don't want to become all these years and be a castaway i don't want to fight and then lose the battle of the ending no no no i want to run the race correctly i want to say like paul i run a race i fought a good fight i kept the faith i fought a good fight i fought a good fight kept the faith i'm speaking to you this morning i am not responsible for any other church in our group this is who i'm after come for this group here so i don't mind nobody business as you realize another no church business don't worry business what did this one do now as a business i know i'm saying for that i have to do here but i make some promises what we see should make a church that will make a revival he said that what we see should make a church i want to be part of that revival i don't wait and do what you're waiting for revival to jump into it there's some people they're not part of the work they're not part of their labor they're not part of the person or the person they want to part for the ride when the wheels turn in they jump on for the ride you'll get caught with that you know by the foolish version because you're thinking you'll get extraordinary brother nice your brother have revelation he's nice enough to tell you go and buy because what i have i have full of myself my gas tank full another extra there's a distance out of the way the other smokes and smokey double face and i start plenty gas for the burn while i'm smoking them out on my way out so i can't share my oil with you go and get for yourself and the oil is the word really so you see i receive the word because the word turns the oil so you have to come to get the word that you can benefit from the word the bible said many the word wasn't mixed with faith so it didn't profit them the wasting time coming to church that's why we don't drag nobody inside of here i don't pump and you should know me by now i don't do that you pull a goat they pull a cow they pull a bull and you had to tie them feed them pat the head so that it wouldn't the horns trimmed the horns and saw their own no my sheep hear my voice [Music] you have better groups to go to go go but if you want a revival you want to put you you want a hungering and twisting you want the five god upon your soul oh glory to god you're in the right place but this is what we're preaching this is what we leave praise god i don't want to sit down and you're wrestling on the preacher and you're certainly pastor and he had to bring everything like somebody said it might the pastor had the key to your life but all you're looking for he's in life i want to persecute my life i want what he is oh i will give him money keys in my life get the keys to my life and he alone can reveal who i am and all kind of nonsense so what are you father therefore i told you i said flesh and blood how to reveal it unto you since when he passed a revealing this i'm revealing that i reveal any other all right then they're like glue they stick under the pasta whenever you go with a whole bunch of people behind him i'm not seeing nothing i seen sons and daughters listen listen listen god don't have no grandchildren i have [Music] god don't have that concern spoil them leave them up anything i want them just an episode and they said he feel is the right heart to pick him up sometimes no like it's a demand and because he's grandfather you do it i'm trying to spoil you but god don't have that god only has sons and daughters no you may be a baby son a teenage son older son but you are sons and daughters that small little guy is a big man in small formation just put 20 years on him you see them there six months and so on but put 20 years on them it's 20 years and six months we think you'll be rocking in yeah i'm sure you roll limbs up after 20 years and six months this will be talking about so hold on the pastors of the rocky people rock the people rock the people so he said you should be teachers are you taking milk you should be strong in faith are sons of god you're like on the priest again no we're in your mouth you fighting the possess you're mounting could i air shout in [Applause] and that's why the bible said that the fight for ministry is here till we all come into the unity of the faith into the knowledge of god onto a perfect man not a perfect boy or a perfect child a perfect man [Applause] stephen stephen full of the holy ghost start to preach he said paul should i was like that it's not stephen he passed the weather name they stole him philip brown say big big thing going on spirit lift him up kind of meet our money you knock he said um fellas uh uh could i co could i leave i'm feeling like the moon so it wasn't that these guys were directed by the spirit [Applause] paul moon peter mooso distant moon so yeah which man leading them say but yeah you know there's the headquarters why paul street emotional he said i didn't consult flesh and blood so don't come up and quote his business and whatnot okay i rented a pillar of fire and the pillar fire reveals under me and paul's had to drop it on them you know and they have to back off got another sun coming through oh glory to god we can have this agreement but this is son and son this is son and being placed come on now paul was placed and god's gonna have some born sons some placed sons and when you're coming to your place no devil could move your altar oh glory is he jesus he might be seated amen jesus he knew he was the word [Music] so when a man crippled there you must say jesus don't need all that drama because he knew his what the word is god when he will where have you laid him that never was done before just where have you laid him then he said roll away the stone there's two things where have you laid him roll away the stone hallelujah oh god could this man lazarus come forth three words let's restart to come three words and those words went through dimensions every year every minute souls flying over here souls people dying their swords going going going when jesus said that his spirit his word had to find lazarus pull it pull it pull it pull it right back pull everything back into the body [Music] well branham said if he didn't call lazarus by name everybody was coming out everybody was coming out therefore you have a name [Music] nobody to take your name oh give the lord a shout nobody can represent you nobody can take your blessing nobody can take your anointing what god have for you is for you oh give the lord some praises people [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah glory to god amen so the token is the life that the blood worship is upon you you are safe from rat that's alone not membership the life of christ has to come into you which is the holy ghost god's token that you have accepted the blood of his son jesus christ therefore when it is these are wesley luther taught it was to believe and there's obviously the chemistry of the blood but this is the last day where the token is required and that makes together the whole unit for the rapture water blood and spirit and sometimes i want to speak on that i'm seeing it water blood and spirit water seven seals blood seven thunders spirit dynamics to the mechanics oh hallelujah brown quality water age the blood age and now the total age of the holy ghost israel knows someone was coming so did luther wesley finney knox calvin all them knew they knew there would come a time that the pillar fire would return back in the church this was the prophecy of alpha and omega same fire that was in the early church come back in the last church oh glory to god we have been now in a time of lingering since the prophet left time are lingering because everything have a time and season oh hallelujah what is the pillar of hacking on the 70s oh my it's been a lamb all the way through luther's time the llama wesley time but now is the talking time that each house each house must be covered by the token each house must be covered by the token all that inside will be covered by the token and the house of god is the body of jesus christ and my one spirit we are baptized to the body now the very spirit itself is a token security imagine people call it the holy ghost so that means the token the very spirit itself is the token the holy spirit itself is the token not the blood the blood was shed at calvary that is true but the blood went back into the elements and when it's come but from the food he lived on but you see inside that blood cell was a life that is what jesus released when that soul appears inside the blood come out our spirit life was released to go through the earth every generation to pick up every elected gene taught of god [Music] so you could be wherever the spirit had to pick up pick you up is that man pick you up it was the spirit pick you up the spirit pick up the gene thought inside of you didn't know it was there but god knew it was there now that thought could become weird do you get that if somebody wasn't backing god's mind like how they could become the word but because you're thought a word that would express you could come into an expression so regardless of where you act listen peter was a cuspard fisherman he didn't know about word and expression and supersman peter was a fisherman a fisherman jesus i'll make you fishers of men stop this fishing thing follow me and peter drop his neck crash the business to follow jesus peter still don't know what's going on jesus introduced promise to them the same works i do shut you down also if you do not say to this mountain jesus even put anointing upon them one time my brother come and say shall be called for fire like like elijah then fathers they get ideas already they don't have character yet but they want to call fire one time you see somebody cast no devils and doing some things and they not with them they get jealous and they come and say shall we stop him because this is waiting now remember jesus this this is you you and i we we just leave the man alone but i'm saying was getting horrors because that fella wasn't with them so there's a horror story just a leading man alone he said one time he said you don't know what spirit you're off next time what somebody mother come and say lord worship the lord could you put one of my sons on your left side and one of my sons on the right side well the other brothers get so hungry for that day god just wanted like an instant promotion a short cut now just just just get them you know light right and left just say i am not responsible for right and left have a cup you could drink it there's a bitter cup if they could drink it well that's fine but i am not responsible for who's sitting right who's in the left that's human everybody want to be somebody everybody wants some kind of attention some kind of way will feel this and they want a child in this and a child that and child that's human but notice when the upper room experience came all that was beaten out bouncing mary had to get old she's touched she's the mother of god she's mother jesus christ mary had to stagger like everybody else it's one baptism it's one robe it's one experience hallelujah is one lord there's one faith it's one baptism all glory to god you've got to meet god's requirement hallelujah you have no social holy ghost like i want to acquire holy ghost but keep you getting holy ghost it doesn't matter quiet or noisy it

let's take a look at the scripture just shut the two let's read the scripture here let me take a wrap up here i wanted to get to this joshua to want to read from voice 1-18 joshua chapter 2 when you finally say amen amen there's some people didn't see amen so how do we return them when they finally see amen amen all right they see people all right joshua the son of none sent out of two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went came out and harlow's house named rehab lodged there it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in hitherton tonight of the children of israel decision of the country and the king of jericho sent on the rehab saying bring forth the men that have come to thee which are entered in the ninth house for they become to search out all our country and the woman told took the two men and hit them and said thus they came in unto me but i wish not once they were and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark the men went out whether the men went i what not pursue after them quickly for you shall overtake them and she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them the stalk of flick tracks which he had laid upon order upon the roof and the men pursued after them that we have jordan under the forts and as soon as they were pursued after them they were going out and shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up under them upon the roof she said unto the men i know that the lord had given you the land and your terror is falling upon us all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan seahorn and ugg whom you ought to destroy as soon as we had heard these things our heart did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is the god of heaven above and it would be neat now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness under my father's house and give me a true token and that he will save alive my father my mother my brethren my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from debt and the men answered our life for yours if you utter not this our business and it shall be when the lord had given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the tongue wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain lease the pursuers meet you and hide yourself dear three days until the pursuers be returned and afterwards you may go and the men said on her we will be blameless of the an oath which yahweh has made us swear behold when we come unto the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet tread in the window which you did let us done by and thou shall bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of the house onto the street his blood will be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with dean the host his blood shall be upon our head if any man i'll not be upon him you may be seated god bless his word go praise the lord and but i'm talking about this this believe in how that name rehab she was a harlot she was a prostitute but she was a believer and this scarlet cord was representative of the blood and they say hang that cord outside the wall because judgment is coming joshua was god's judgment angel oh praise god god destroyed either was coming they knew it and joshua was that angel oh glory to god are you hearing me now who is the the saudi joshua he was the destroying angel but that token that was hanged out there hallelujah praise god but stephen brought

believe that nonsense for ram says when the blood shall be taken unto you the spirit knows the token unto you the life was in the blood and just think that the same token that used in egypt the same life token was in egypt was in egypt god used a symbol there joshua perfect for jesus the token sign his mission to preach now what's something when joshua come to take the land those messenger may not be with him you know all they tell joshua there's a lady you will see the code hanging outside you can't touch that so joshua have to honor his messenger's word oh hallelujah do you see that joshua come to mash up lick up destroy wreck destroy everything else but when he sees that that your only host was standing that had to stand because the cord was hanging out my god mama you keep praying your prayers hanging over your children your prayers hanging over your sons and daughters you keep on praying don't give up now hang that code over your family oh glory to god hallelujah listen bahram says when god ordered it that house never shook down and when joshua stood there and gave the signal to destroy the whole thing rayam and all our people sat right there with their possession all their possession was in the house safely they just stood there didn't have to look out the window they could read scripture why the bible was going why the battle was going on oh glory to god my god i'm gonna finish here tonight friends it's not even is the condition of the heart the baptism the holy ghost it has to be the token life on display i can't i'll continue next week but but what i want to say with you is this that i'll be fooling you if i tell you anything short of this that you got to meet god's requirement people like to be safe they like to know uh they have the best pastor they are the best church or whatever it is and they have the confidence to be in there and so on that's what the catholic does they have the priests usually say a long time priest you say the whole mass in latin the people don't even know what they're saying secretary men sprinkle two pieces of water and so on like that the people leave here feeling sanctimonious because the priest did it the same thing coming in a different form in this message you got a priest bringing mysteries down it's a mysterious peace priest that'll bring your life that's the one mystery you hear that never hear it show never see it so but the point about it the evening time message is not never see it so never hear it so the evil message is to apply the token try it apply it who want to laugh let them laugh who want to say this let them talk you're applying the token when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you hallelujah listen you have to come to that spot that they've trained that breakup in
