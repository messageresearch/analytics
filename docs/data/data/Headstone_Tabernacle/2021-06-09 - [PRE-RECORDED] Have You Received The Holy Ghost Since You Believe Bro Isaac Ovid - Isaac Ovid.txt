the lord praise the lord from the rising of the sun to the growing town of the same your name is worthy your name is exalted you are bigger than our problems you are bigger than our childs you are bigger than every situation you are caught alone you are caught up by yourself may you have the preeminence in this house may you take your place in this house may you take control in this house may you have glory in this house may you have honor in this house you are worthy to be praised lord you are blessed for blessing and honor might and power be unto the lamb that was slain blessed be the name of the lord are you happy to be in the house of the lord this morning if you have your bibles would you turn with me to two portions of scripture reading from matthew chapter 24. i read it from acts chapter 19. matthew 24 and verse 14. then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh and reading from acts chapter 19 i'm reading from verse one and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coast came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have he received the holy ghost since he believes and they said unto him we have not so much has heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then we baptized and they said unto john's baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated so for a title this morning have you received the holy ghost since you believed and for a subject desperate to possess your individual inheritance and an inspiration another book of acts so this morning we want to really hone into individuals hone into your christian walk your christian journey and to what you have to be expecting and what you ought to be preparing for you know by the branham he gave an analogy he said i believe it was a turtle and he said he took a stick and tried to prod the turtle the turtle didn't move he threw something else in a turtle he didn't respond he said it's only when he took some fire and put it to the turtle the turtle legs flew out and he's had to move at his fastest speed because that is what fire does it gets you moving and it is the nature of human beings who try to get comfortable wherever they're at you moved to a different country you moved a different neighborhood you moved a different job in whatever position you are in it's your nature to get comfortable but within the context of your spiritual journey there is no such thing as as staying comfortable you have to stay moving because you have an enemy a real enemy and this war that we're fighting is not a war against flesh or blood isn't a war against your wife or your husband or your children or your boss so it has nothing to do with that it's a spiritual war because you are under a different covenant what happens out there in the world is different from what you will experience because you are under a different covenant you are here to be tested and for a proving ground that you are not going to be deceived and no matter what temptation or trial comes your way you will have a testimony that you will serve god you're not here to be a church member you're not here to be in the message you are here to have a testimony to show the world to show your family that you will serve the lord that he is your king that he is your majesty that he is your leader he is your guide he is your joy he is your peace you you look to him to keep you going you look to him to wake you up in the morning when the doctor runs out of ideas about what's wrong with you you know he knows because he made you he is your creator he is the great physician he is your guidance and that is what keeps you inspired it's all about him the moment your christian journey loses him as your focus there's something wrong there are many people church is a ritual amen it's it's i heard somebody say it's a casual it's a thing to do it's on your to-do list so there's search on sunday then i have to go and pay the bill on monday and then i have to deliver this report on tuesday it's a thing to do it has become casual to us instead of it being the very source of our existence that this kingdom that we come from is a different world it's a it's a different place it's a different life it's a different law and that kingdom is what we are fighting to press into and the kingdom suffered violence and the violence taken by force with all of our efforts somebody always spoke about it last week you could take a pig and put a bow tie on the pig put a three-piece suit on the pig put perfume on the pig you could put the pig in a limousine and drive it his destination the moment it comes out of the control environment it will go back to what it used to do because that's the nature of the pig and that's the nature of every man that's born in sin and shaped in iniquity and the bible said all have come short but until your nature is changed you'll go back to your old ways until there's something change in your heart you go back to your old ways and the preaching of the gospel is to prepare you for an encounter with the pillar of fire the disciples they walked with jesus they talked with jesus they saw miracles if it was any group of people who should have not backslid was the disciples think about it think about being with jesus by the sheen and you're there on the boat and the storm comes and jesus is sleeping and you are scared and jesus wakes him and says peace be still wouldn't you be persuaded of what this jesus is talking about you're hungry and he takes five loaves and two fishes and feeds thousands of people wouldn't that persuade you of this man's ministry when jesus stood outside of the grave of lazarus and say lazarus comfort how much more examples do you need before you will convince that this ministry is right but yet still when jesus died what did these disciples do they went back to fishing they went back to what they used to do they went back to their old ways for three and a half years as it were they had listened to the greatest preacher who would ever preach they listened to the greatest teacher who would ever teach they listened to god himself veil in 16 elements and after his three and a half year ministry when jesus died these disciples went back fishing so don't be surprised when people stand in church for years and you can't understand how is it they somehow find themselves fishing they find themselves just there they find themselves no joy no zeal no enthusiasm they find themselves their chest in church or maybe not even in church or coming to church when they want to come to church or praying when they think they should pray or when is an emergency because this is how the disciples found themselves until jesus rose from the dead and breathed upon them receiving the holy ghost and in his resurrection ministry he opened their understanding to the scriptures and he placed them under a promise but even while they were under the promise the bible said they were afraid and they hid in the upper room but something happened in their lives when the holy ghost came one day the bible says there was a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting in and cloven tongues of fire divided itself and came out upon each one and they walked out that room without fear and peter said this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel he said these men are not drunk as use of poles but this is that and when the holy ghost came upon peter all of his fear was gone all of his condition was gone all of his backsliding was gone what was it it was the holy ghost itself it was not a book it was not a thief it was not a message it was the holy ghost itself a portion of god had tabernacled himself inside of these men and that is what we need that's what we need in here this morning for the holy ghost itself to tabernacle in each one of us and that's my burden this morning because if you are if you don't know that's what you are supposed to expect or prepare for you will not make preparation for it but those disciples they went into the upper room under the promise received you the holy ghost so they were there getting ready they were there making preparations they were there and they had separating themselves from the world the situations that had now existed that forced them into that place where they couldn't go out where they couldn't worry about what out there because the romans were were looking for them but while they were there god met them and friends is that easy when you have to stand alone most of us we we want to be part of something but those disciples had to stand alone away from family away from friends and among others who had the same motivation others who had the same desire others who wanted to go to the same place and that's what has to happen to each of you you must be prepared to separate from everything that will take you away from your spiritual destination friends we have to get desperate to receive the holy ghost it's not just believing because when paul in acts 19 met some believers he asked them the question have you received the holy ghost since you believed the question is that if you are a believer the question is that if you have the books and if you have the tapes and if you know the message the question is have you received the holy ghost since you believed and if you have not received the holy ghost there ought to be a desperation in your soul day and night morning and evening day and night morning and evening lord i need this because the holy ghost is eternal life the holy ghost is power the holy ghost is your inheritance the holy ghost is the token that god wants to look at can the church say amen the holy ghost will burn the snake out of your heart the holy ghost will take those desires that you are struggling with because you could try to bring your body under subjection and there's a lot you could do as a human and a man you could try with your choices but it's a whole different thing when the holy ghost takes complete control and takes control of your elements takes control of your eyes takes control of your ears where you only go where he wants you to go it's no longer you choosing not to do but you have gone past that stage you have already chosen and has brought over peace last week because thou has done this thing then the holy ghost has the full authority to take his place in your heart and lead you to where you don't even want to go take you to where you don't even want to go because it's a holy ghost it's power the holy ghost will change the way you walk it'll change the way you talk it'll change the way you worship it'll change the way you pray it'll change the way you love it'll change what you eat it'll change where you go it'll make you a christian it'll make you testify it'll make you talk different it'll make you walk different it'll tie you he is your comforter that's what the holy ghost is he is your guide he will take you to your school he will take you to your job he will comfort you and nobody else can that's what the holy ghost gives you for it gives you power it gives you power to press up it gives you power to break free that's what we need [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah that's what we need the holy ghost it's power when the holy ghost comes upon you you no longer yourself when the holy ghost comes upon you they thought that it was peter that they were talking to but the holy ghost had tabernacled himself in the book of acts of on the throne of peter's heart peter was no longer in control peter couldn't stop the holy ghost when the holy ghost has the preeminence he does what he wants to do and that's god's strategy he wants individuals that he can place the holy ghost in and shape the world like he did on the day of pentecost come on young people is there anybody wants the holy ghost is anybody needs a holy ghost that's what this service is about this morning it's a holy ghost service hallelujah hallelujah that's your promise that's your promise don't you know your party is a temple of the holy ghost the reason you were born the reason you were born is to be a tabernacle that the holy ghost can step in the holy ghost doesn't want to fill this building he wants to fill this temple he doesn't want to be tied down to a physical location the holy ghost wants to move wherever he wants to go the holy ghost wants to move in port of spain the holy ghost wants to move in arima the holy ghost wants to move into your family's house how will he move he'll move inside of you he needs some hands he needs some eyes he needs somebody who would surrender and say lord here i am send me take over i surrender i give up i'm no more myself i've tried my way but this morning lord if you could use anything lord you could use me oh hallelujah i pray you break free this morning i pray you break out of yourself this morning unless you get to get unless you get the holy ghost you're not gonna make it you can come to church for 10 years for 20 years for 30 years that's what the pentecostals do that's what the baptists do that's what the matter is do there's no difference of attendance is not the measure of your walk with god how much you read is not the measure of your walk with god but the measure that you have crossed over is when the holy ghost comes upon you peter he graduated on the day of pentecost he didn't graduate when he walked underwater he graduated when the holy ghost came down in his soul [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah shake yourself this morning shake past your religious spirit this morning without the holy ghost you're not gonna make it because the god said when i see the blood i'll pass over you he told moses take the blood up apply it on the doorpost let that be your identification put that on display because the token must be displayed the holy ghost must be displayed that's what the devil hates him he hates the holy ghost because the holy ghost has power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah oh somebody giving praise this morning somebody gave him glory this morning oh somebody get desperate this morning i don't know what's going to happen this morning but i have a burden for the sighing and the crying you have got to be bothered by what's taken place in the world you have got to be troubled that's why the bible says to put a mark upon those that sigh on crime for the abomination we have gotten too comfortable the abomination doesn't bother us anymore the abomination doesn't affect us anymore we tolerate the foolishness but for the pranam said god cannot build his church on a bunch of nonsense it's either we are going to have church or no church at all but we are going to have a church without spot without wrinkle we're going to have a clean church we're going to have a holy ghost filled church we're going to have a church that the sick cannot stay sick that demon powers cannot come to the church hallelujah the house of hell will have to give way to the name of jesus i don't care what's wrong with your life right now it doesn't matter the only thing that's important is the holy ghost shake yourself forget about your bills forget about the problems together forget about it the holy ghost gives you power to take over every attack of the enemy you are born to be sons and daughters of the living god worship is what we do praise is what we do overcome is what we do what devil you talking about have you on the ropes there's power in your little finger that's what with a branham said he has power to push black sickness hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah for too long we have sat and allowed the temple to impede our homes this morning i say enough is enough we are the fathers in the household who will take back their homes and say as for me and my house we will serve the lord we are the praying bombers who will take back their place in their homes and say as for me and my house we will serve the lord it's time to light a fire inside the church time to light a fire inside your homes oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] you may be seated we're going to make this place uncomfortable [Applause] uncomfortable for people who don't want to be christians there are other churches to go to this place would be uncomfortable to people who don't really want god but abraham said in every church there are three kinds of believers they are make believers they are unbelievers and they are true believers we can't kick out the make and the unbeliever because some of them they are good actors but what we can do is make the church so uncomfortable that the make believers feel like this is not for me anymore and the unbelievers say this is not for me anymore you're preaching too hard you're preaching too rough you're preaching too tough some of you are too lazy too lazy as christians how do you want god to bless you and you don't want to sacrifice when david said we bring a sacrifice of praise into the house of god what does that mean it's a sacrifice it's when you don't feel like praising when things are going wrong when you're tired in your body when you're sick all over but yet still you bring a sacrifice and you offer it to god and say lord i'm broken i'm tired i'm wary but i want to praise you hallelujah get out your flesh get out your laziness get out your canality if you know you need to repent repent make it right with god and get on fire for god he is still the same yesterday he has killed us entertained he has killed us him forever [Applause] [Music] [Applause] somebody's gonna break feet today somebody's gonna break free somebody's gonna break free today and light the fire not only here but when you go back to your home light of fire light a fire in your house like the fire in your car throw those music things out that's not supposed to be there throw it out just don't even wander and land just throw it out god your heart because the holy ghost wants to go there got it got it protect it the enemy wants to be there but we're not going to let him be there because there's a seed of predestination that was planted in your soul before there was a world you cannot fail you are not even the believer brother branham said you were not even the believer but the word in you you didn't even put it there he made it that you can't even miss this he made it that no matter what you did you couldn't miss this appointment the devil couldn't see when he did it but he dropped a seed a hidden seed inside of your soul and every seed has got to bring forth after its kind it just needs the right atmosphere so let's create the atmosphere oh because in the right atmosphere satan gets mad he's upset this morning he's upset you're in the house of god he wish you stayed on this morning but you made it to the house of god and because you are here he's in trouble he's in trouble he's in trouble you broke past the burial when you woke up this morning something got a hold of you oh somebody help me preach this morning somebody help me preach this morning you didn't even wake up yourself you might have struggled to get into the car you struggled to get your clothes you struggle up the road you weren't feeling all religious but the devil he knew something was going to happen that's why it was a struggle if it wasn't a struggle there's no blessing but if there was a struggle give the lord a shout of praise because the devil is finished you are pressed fast like the lily you press past and you are here and because you are here and god is here something has got to happen [Applause] holy ghost fire polling was power polygons fire holding us power give me the all-time religion give me the old-time preaching [Applause] [Music] the devil has no power no but everybody said the devil is a bluff that pain in your body it's a bluff [Applause] the condition of your children is a bluff [Applause] the problems in your marriage is a bluff your financial problems is a bluff the devil has no power [Applause] may your spiritual minds open up that you were represented when lucifer got his angels and tried to do a cool up there michael drew his sword and there were some angels some sons of god some morning stars who fought with michael [Applause] these angelic spirits they represented us these angelic beings represented us so fighting in the spiritual realm is not foreign to us it is what we do and that's why god could say whatever you blind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven because he knows you can handle it because you are attribute sons of the [Applause] spirit so this morning you may be seated we serve notice to every female condition we serve notice to apprise us we serve notice to high blood pressure we serve notice to low blood pressure we serve notice to the blind eyes we serve notice to the feeble knees we serve notice to every condition heart condition kidney condition whatever it is every physical condition for the branham taught us those are spirits those are demons and if it's our spirits and demons we are equipped to take them on because there's power in the church of the living god all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into the church there's power here today to cast out devils you may be seated we serve notice just the spirit of lust this morning we serve notice to the spirit of fornication against adultery against drinking against smoking against pornography against every unclean thing we are serving notice to let the devil know that we are counting down to time being up when he has to evacuate this is not an eviction this is an evacuation event give people time evacuation need to move faster we are evacuating the devil this morning from this church we are serving and notice satan a different storm is coming this is our storm it's a spiritual storm [Applause] hallelujah your children are coming back yes yes yes your son is coming back yes your daughter is coming back yes your husband coming back yes your wife coming back yes your brother yes your sister yes say it claim it believe it rejoice about it it's got to happen thus saith the lord [Applause] hello [Applause] jesus said to peter the devil has desired to sift you like wheat in that day sifting of the wheat was not done through the strainers that we have now the sifting of the wheat but the anthony was they would have these almost four sticks as it were with almost like a cloth between a huge it wasn't like one person's job but they would throw it up and throw it up so when jesus telling this to peter peter noticeably he would be concerned because the devil wants to sift you like me throw your life up and down and side to side you don't know where your foot is you don't know where you are he said he said but i have prayed [Applause] that your feet still not listen he didn't say you wouldn't be sifted he said the devil desires to sift you like he didn't go into how and when and how long if just what happened but he said listen no matter what you go to i've prayed for you that through all of what you have to go through your feet would feel not because if you keep your feet that faith is what will keep you going if you hold on to this world and this promise no matter if you're up you're down your upside down just keep your feet can the church say man you may be seated i pray that today your spiritual eyes will open up and the amnesia that you have been suffering because some of you really have to have forgotten who you are to do some of the things that you want to do but as you come to a greater realization of who you are in god it should give you a confidence to tell the devil no it sounds very simple but it's in these day-to-day victories that we win the war [Applause] you are the sum total of every decision you make years ago we didn't have as much lifestyle diseases as we have now but we have evolved now we have young children addicted to soft drink and addicted to juice and processed sugars and different things and diseases like obesity and all these things these are going to happen overnight you don't drink one sort of drink and suddenly you obese it doesn't happen it's a process it is a process you drink a coke every single day there's an effect of that and then people want to lose it in five days and it took five years to reach there and then you have these phenomenal programs lose it in ten days lose it in five days intensities and mathematically it doesn't make sense because it was one plus one plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus 5 plus 3 soft drinks a day and and your spiritual maturity is worn by simple victories every single day the question was asked to the prophet how do you grow how do you grow as a christian and the answer has always been very simple read your bible and pray every day we just sing it in sunday school and that's why i said youth oriented service is not just for young people because we have caught on cold calebs who have stopped growing because they no longer read their bibles and pray every day they have they have graduated seemingly when god told joshua meditate on the word day and night so you will have good success and you want to know why you're struggling and why things not working out and why you can't get a financial breakthrough and why life is so high and why you're stronger than god is just saying i'm just waiting i'm just waiting because the word teaches god never leaves us we are the ones who leave him and but ibrahim said if you ever want to get back to god walk right back to the place where you left him he'll be standing right there because he it's not his nature to leave you it is nature to follow us this is why remember the branham spoke of when adam fell he said it wasn't adam went looking for god it was god went looking for adam adam adam i'm used to fellowshipping where are you where are you adam and adam was out of his position it's god's nature to come after us it is god's nature to reconcile with us and that's why brother branham said god wants to give you the holy ghost more than you even want to receive it god doesn't want to withhold the holy ghost from us he wants to give it to us the prophet said more than we even want to receive it but friends a holy god cannot come and live where there is darkness [Music] and but ibrahim said it like this he said before god could fill you you have to empty yourself and for some of us it's some of us are so spiritual we are full up of our own spiritual self so there are different things we need to empty out of today there are those who have to empty out sin and the world and that's why sometimes and that's why brother braham said there were people who would come to these meetings sinners prostitute on the street and get healed because they didn't have no preconception they were not fact-checking and they were not no they just came in humble sincere they believed and they were healed and people who sat in church for years they would fill up of themselves you know how many scriptures are you know how many books i've read how many old les pray meeting i've been in and they feel to realize that god is still a simple god who is looking for surrender and faith from individuals who are sold out so some of us we have to empty out of our pride lost whatever it is our own way our own eyes some of us empty out our good self i'm always in church never miss a service if you're not seeing me here by 90 day something wrong the road broke and the gap was so big i couldn't jump over because it was just a simple break i would have jumped over and still be here for nine today good self but god is not measuring people on works and on your effort lest that you boast that is you because he wants all the glory at the end of the day said the heston will come with shelton's crying grace grace grace grace because we are all fearless to begin with we all meet there's nobody here but i'm not better than anybody i'm the worst one i want to be worst place i don't want to be better than anybody else because i know is the grace of god to my life if he didn't pick me up until my life were wrong i don't know where i'd be i could get no credit for what you see here this morning it's the grace of god and that is what every testimony should be is the grace of almighty god i was lost i was a sinner i was no good but god rich in grace and mercy pick me up turn me around sent a prophet with a message that i wouldn't be a pentecostal or just religious but tell me there's a wave back our way back to eden our way back to we shall reign on the earth our way back to spoken word our way back to the original seed that's what this prophet's brought oh we ought to be rejoicing oh we ought to be so happy all we ought to be so grateful [Applause] and i'll say it again friends this is not about rules in that same message things that are to be our homework but the brandon was saying when he leaves his house to go on the field he doesn't turn his wife and say while i'm gone don't have any other husband anybody listen to anybody remember that part of red hair i said she doesn't say bill while you're gone don't have an inner wife i remember the brandon goes on to say but what if something happens in the field you say i'll come back and look at those wrinkles and those gray hair and say would you forgive me he said but as he looks at her he said it'll hurt him so much he'd rather die than have to even do that so because of his love for her he will never want to do anything to hurt her and that's what real love is listen it for yourself that's your homework things that ought to be that's your message and i say to young people all the time but these churches have real rules that's what they say a real rule you can't do this you can't do that you can't do that you can't do this you don't do this and i say it's not about rules it's about love because if you love god then it would be in your nature to only do things to please him then all of a sudden it's no longer rules it's he doesn't like this he likes this he doesn't like this he likes us and then all of a sudden your life becomes easy so as a christian sister he likes it and my hair is combed out why would i want to cut it he doesn't like it with his gut awesome he likes it when i dress modestly that's what i'm his queen it's love i said to the church some time ago my wife likes white's clothes in one side colors on the next side telly brothers real rules in my house now have to put the white clothes in one corner put the colors in the next corner but because i love her after finding a way to put the white clothes here and put the colors here because it's easier to wash but that's what love does your behavior you adjust your behavior when you're in love [Applause] i remember one time she made a sandwich and she toasted the bread and she thought that she was doing a good job of twisting the bread with tuna and i say listen i don't like the bread toasted with tuna leave the bread without toasting it now when she toasted that she thought it was the best thing to do you know she didn't toast it to get me upset but she thought i would have wanted but she didn't know so within this christian journey there are things that you may do that you don't know if it working just yet but that's what the word comes for i don't want that toasted i don't want to just adjust a little bit just just and the holy spirit is your guide he will guide you along this journey and as you get deeper and deeper in love you begin to become one so you see certain couples yes they move the eye they know what to do without words being said without words no communication but it's a connection and you read there were men a few words they only spoke when he wanted them to speak but it brought them with one nod they know what to do is this same thing we're preaching about that's that's the message with one nod you know what god saying to do because you are so connected you are the same wavelength his words your words his thoughts your thoughts his behavior your behavior his nature your nature his being your being his attributes you are what are you flesh of my flesh bone of my bone spirit of my spirit bride and groom husband and wife mrs jesus christ and the lord jesus christ bride of jesus christ can the church say amen but that type of relationship with god cannot be intellectual it has to be hard it has to be the same spirit it cannot be your spirit that's why the bible says i'll give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit and then i'll put my spirit in there because when you have his spirit now you could communicate now you can relate now you can talk the same language don't you want to talk the same language with him don't you want to become a deeper christian with him how many love him this morning wonderful so i'm going to assume that if you love him you will want to do things to please him [Music] so how many people this morning want to do everything to please him because there are many people who say they love him you know i mean because the people watch them they're declaring it from the car i love jesus written on the windscreen but their behavior and their action and you know love is an action word so if you love god then your actions should indicate that you love god so if you love god then i shouldn't see you dressing in a way that would not please him i shouldn't see you having conversations about what wouldn't please him i shouldn't see you putting stuff on facebook in a way that if i could see it imagine him because he's seen we're doing in secret if i see what you're doing and they're wrong father's for him and he's here in secret and some of you say you love him and he's doing it in public how could you have a testimony that you love jesus and you will do stuff to hurt him when the bible says christians like grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption greed means the hurt many of us heard the holy spirit with how we speak how we act we spoke about it many many times how the holy ghost like of comes to the lamb dove wouldn't come to the wolf and i heard a preacher's analogy very simple analogy to how sensitive the dove is he said think of a butterfly when a butterfly comes it will land and if you if you act irrationally or it will fly away but we have to attract the holy spirit to our lives i'm giving you guidelines and tips and encouragements for those of you who want to get the holy ghost those who really want to but ibraheem said when you want to get a hold of this what you do spend time with people who have the holy ghost who are your friends who is your advisors who are who who leading you why are you leading anybody or you're just there drifting around do you want to change or do you want i said it last sunday i said that island of baby it still troubles me because sometimes you know even though you know something going to happen i just think they said in 300 years it's the first time in 300 years that the island of barbuda is uninhabitable on there no humans in 300 years i said my wife we're in 2017 that's 1917 18 17 17 17 300 years there are no humans there a month before that people were living life as normal had no idea that a month later their houses would be flat schooled flat airport flat no idea living life as it were in the days of nowhere they ate they drank they gave it to marriage until the day that noah went to the heart and god shut the door they had no idea and by the brandon preachers say one day the last song will be sung the last scripture would be read the last sermon would be preached [Music] and it will not be announced today is the last service it will come unawares it will be all of a sudden the storm is here the bible for years we know it there'll be wars there'll be rumors of wars there'll be earthquakes and diverse places we read the scripture and it's happening all over hurricane after hurricane earthquake this that and you know what it's all it's going to get worse because that's what's supposed to happen where are you going to run to your degree can protect you your company can protect you your money can protect you i saw a report there's this metallic capsule that opens up that you could go into and close it and lock it and it could roll and this supposed to be what the ultra wealthy believe they could go into in natural disasters the escape pod talk about how man creativity want to always find a way out of something they say they have some next bunker that goes deep down into the earth so in case there's nuclear distress you could go down there only rich people and bright people whose was a continuous civilization they don't know where they want to continue civilization and i don't need a degree in aerodynamics or physics to continue it's just because i was born to continue i will be continuing because we shall reign on the earth i don't care how much bunker how much capsule the bible says a new earth they have to find millions of dollars three million five million us to go into this capsule to roll around when one of these days better punch these 16 elements will change brother branham said the rapture is a revelation it will go from outside it will go from inside to out one of these days what you have been hearing will come alive in your soul and all of us are transformational a switch will be hit and these 16 elements will begin to chain them in a quicken of an eye between six and nine we shall be going home [Applause] and when we leave here it's temporary because we gotta come back because we shall reign on the earth [Applause] the whole creation waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god [Music] and friends the rapture is not supposed to be you know the people that cow they can't wait for their after they just want to escape does not escape it's about we being taken away for god to bring judgment we're not trying to escape because we're scared no we're not scared the bible said for he isn't giving us the spirit of fear that's the bible what are you afraid of but he's given a spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father fear is not in our vocabulary in fact many times you just spoke his two words fear not i think about 66 or sometimes he said fear not be not afraid it is i fear not fear not fear not fear not stop being afraid you are just like him we are joint heirs with christ the trees know who you are that's why they are groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of god when born sons filled sons will suddenly wake up and speak and what they say will be created somebody's saying man so who's ready to press past themselves this morning who's ready to claim their individual inheritance who's ready to say lord i want to serve you with everything my all my heart my life can we give the lord a hand of praise the musician can get ready i'm almost done [Music] but friends what we have this morning will not exist all the time one day there will be a last service only there will be a last meeting and while there's still blood and there's still grace every service is a burden in our heart to see you get closer to christ then closer to the church closer to christ to be like jesus that's our prayer to be like jesus to be like him to press past ourselves and to get that that eternal life in our souls you can begin to play something softly we read the scripture there'll be two in the field one taken one left i know you've heard it before but the issues of life sometimes makes us forget how serious this thing is there'll be two in a bed there'll be two in a field one taken one left it's not to the group it's the individuals i don't believe in my heart that there's anybody here today who wants to be left [Music] i don't believe in my heart in the days of moses when he told him to put blood on the door that there were people who say i want to die [Music] so the question is not if you want to go the question is how much you really want to go because we have a requirement to meet the preacher didn't make the requirement the passage major requirement god himself set the requirement he said when i see the blood i'll pass over you you have to be willing to give it all up [Music] and say lord i surrender you have to be willing to say lord i recognize i'm no good i'm no good [Music] lord i need deliverance lord i my prayer life is not what it's supposed to be i'm no good [Music] lord i need the holy ghost i'm no good lord i need a touch i'm no good lord i need an experience i'm no good [Music] lord my heart i need a new heart i need a new spirit i need your spirit i don't want to go on living this way i shared it on the communion service i said the rich young ruler he came with a desire he said master what can i do to inherit eternal life and brother branham said you could never come to the presence of the god and and leave the same he said you will either leave better or you will leave worse friends this man stood before jesus and jesus responded he said obey your commandments obey your mother and your father and all the commandments and this young man he responded and that i guess he would have felt good he said master i've done all of this from my youth [Music] what lack i get and jesus discerned his heart as his discerning hearts this morning through the word he told that young man he said go sell all that you have and give to the poor [Music] and the bible says when that boy heard that he turned away and he left sorrowful and that peened me [Music] why would you come to jesus and leave disappointed [Music] why would you come to jesus and leave sorrowful when he could answer every prayer when he could meet every need but that young man was not willing to give up what he held dear to him and that's why he left sorrowful friends every one of us me included we have something to give up this morning we have to give up something you know what you need to give up won't you give it up today won't you let it go today won't you come back home today won't you rededicate your life today would you say lord i've not been living as i should lord i've been trying yes i've been trying but i've been trying hard enough lord i've been giving you 99 but there's still more this is not just the people who are struggling they are those of us who are strong but we can do better [Music] we are solid we are grounded but we can do more we can pray for more people we can encourage more people we cannot be satisfied let's all stand to our fee [Music] i wouldn't want this service to end this morning without giving the opportunity for somebody to come to the altar this morning [Music] is there anybody this morning you want to be prayed for maybe the world has touched you in some way and you say lord i want to rededicate my life lord i don't want to go homeless here that i came lord but today today i want to draw a line in the sand and say lord i recognize
