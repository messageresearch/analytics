thank the convention bring greetings to you from the little flock back in freet town the grace of God has been with us there and your prayers was a mighty force your prayers for us proved very effective God stood by us and we thank God for his grace so to me it was a training for this season God has to prove his word we in a real season church and I came here with a heavy before the year ends last year the watch night towards the year of this year believe the voice of God spoke to my heart clearly strong voice the season we are in 2015 and my heart still beat towards that but this year 2015 a key is going to be faith is Anointed to believe tonight that ke can be turned in Co if you can believe that you can't have faith by just reading the word the third pool was to connect the bride to voice words bring us back to L somebody say Amen to that the voice of God will come back to the church like it was in Eden where Adam and Eve had the ability to hear from God they did not have a written bible the voice of God come to them somebody say Amen to that praise God Amen like the prophets of old have Bible like this but they had the ability to hear the voice of God and that is your promise because it takes the voice of God to bring forth a manifestation until God speaks there cannot be a manifestation so therefore tonight we going to be raised up into the next level like said this morning that God will send another comforter the word gave them a measure of comfort that was all right but there was another comforter that comforter is called Dynamic the voice of God so the voice of God came hallelujah praise God Amen you have two types of word in the Bible you have the written word written seal then you have seven Thunders that's not written so which one do you want when the bride goes over this Bible becomes a voice and that gives you Faith so therefore tonight the voice of God will speak to your hearts that you are here the voice of God will speak to your heart that you receive the Holy Ghost voice of God will speak to your heart Hallelujah it has got to be a voice it can't come any other way intellectualism has killed the message but God is raising up a fful Ministry a people with the ability to hear from God said this Omega bride will have the Lord or she keeps still so but we cannot keep Ste because the voice of God is moving that is your promise for tonight th the Lord we keep still so we are coming to the season you can only speak for God because the mouth of is going to be put into the mouth of the fal Ministry the fal ministry will speak for God hallelujah praise God that is my burden that's where I'm heading for because I came from logos I'm going back to logos you came from logos we going back to Lo and nothing can stop that praise Hallelujah so therefore tonight seven th Revelation has put you in position to be able to hear the voice of God the voice of God is coming tonight God is going to speak tonight somebody say Amen tonight praise God hallelujah we are not de God gave us here the Bible say to him that hear Let Him hear what the spirit is saying but thank you tonight that we have the ability to hear from God the Lord you shall be seal you shall be here somebody tonight is leaving this meeting with the Holy Ghost somebody tonight is leaving this meeting he I challenge you to believe that you can't go back like you the spirit of God is going to possess your life hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah so therefore this meeting now the is taking the next level in the message we going to be raised up to the Dynamics the voice of God coming back to the church hallelujah praise God is that what you want that's what you're living for that is the restoration take those seven thundering voices to liter turn the heart of the children the prophet said they must be reveal they have revealed the Dively revealed mystery truth is what it will take to turn the heart of the children back the faith of the fathers so are you ready tonight are you prepared tonight to hear the voice of God tonight you want the Holy Ghost tonight you want to be healed tonight praise God hallelujah hallelujah spirit of God is moving the spirit of God is acting God is going to lift up a standards God hallelujah Glory I'm confident tonight that the Jesus Christ going to move tonight to Luke 4 I have a little title tonight charity is here that my faith to identify the fful ministry as messages of the [Music] Resurrection The brotherly kindness of Jesus is a manifestation of the father's kindness Hallelujah Luke 418 it reads on this wi the spirit of the Lord is upon me that's how I feel right now Hallelujah because he have anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor so I am not preaching in this future I believe the spirit of God is here since this morning upon this man God God will anoint them to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the Blind and set at Liberty them that are bruised verse 19 to preach the acceptable of the Lord because over in Isaiah it adds on there to preach the Vengeance of our God and this morning where the Paul brought that out from Isiah the in our heart [Music] and of my redeem God anointed my faith and let me go to Joshua 3:7 Joshua 3:7 Joshua chapter 3 verse 7 and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee and thou shall command the priest that be the act of the Covenant saying when he have come to the brink of the water of Jordan you shall stand still in Jordan and Joshua said unto the children of Israel come hither and hear the words of the Lord your God and Joshua said hereby ye shall know that the Living God is among you this is how you will know that the Living God is among you that he will without fail he will without fail drive out from before you the canites and the hites and the heite and the parisite and the gasit and the Amorite and the jaite heavenly father we are so thankful tonight we come here Lord by faith pray for brother Lord pray that you anoint him anoint his body anoint his Spirit anoint his soul Lord give us one mind pray there Lord that the Holy Spirit himself that called for this meetings will make himself visible tonight so the seven seal shall be plainly open to the people so Christ is no longer veiled but Christ shall be seen visibly father we thank you Lord for tonight that's the purpose of the message Lord Jesus want want to be mindful to thank you for this morning what a great Opening Service faing words of promise we know your words cannot fail and Lord we thank you because we have been L by the spirit of truth because elohim's nature isn't our souls so in our nature in our soul we cannot see we thank you today Lord bless our tonight give the people Faith put them in position to be able to believe for their ceing put them in position to be able to believe Lord for virt power for service put them in position to be able to believe to overcome the things of the world that's my prayer God tonight in Jesus name we pray you may be seated hallelujah praise God so you just had my title charity is here to identify the Bible ministry as messengers of the Resurrection that's our burden I believe the next move of the spirit bring will will will is to bring the F Ministry on the SC because you can't get nowhere as you are now except by a Ministry somebody say Amen to that church for all these years you have been trained how to operate a Revival because a Revival signifies a move of God in power but you have been trained how to get the best out of your Revival like God has to also train men say God cannot send a Revival God men a train not in the School of Theology but they trained in God's R School of training they know who God is they know God heals they know God feels they know God is powerful they know God is omnipotent they know that they know God cannot Li they know God's word cannot fail hallelujah praise God they understand that amen amen so this has been a prayer amen Build Me Up Lord into this let Christ be my head this is my prayer as a minister let working through me on my Foundation of my faith you knowledge Temperance patience Bly kindness Walk In Me Oh Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sick or D denomination no denomination friend or no friend let that work in me let Christ virtue knowledge flow out so virtue knowledge out it not say faith faith is already revealed faith is not flow out faith comes by Revelation somebody say Amen Fai has got to be revealed amen hallelujah praise God Amen now reveal Faith reveal faith is a faith that opens your understanding to understand the scriptures reveal faith will help you recognize it helps you to align your inside with your outside Jesus came back 4 days he opened their understanding but the understanding was to understand scripture to understand what is written but the understanding was Jesus making events clear by prophecy in other words it was a revelation it was a type of faith that makes you see what God is [Music] saying that means Jesus was able to align events with proy saw then they saw that the death of Jesus on the was prophecy they saw the resurrection of Jesus was prophecy he aligned the events of that day with prophecy then their understanding open up so this is 2015 where where are we at are we in the bride now what has God done as a bride of Jesus Christ since 1965 where the went to be with the Lord can we say nothing has happened or something has happened when I believe something has happened praise God hallelujah because I am here I am an event of Prophecy I did not just appear I Ament you are you are of Prophecy you did not just come we did not just appear came according to prophecy you've got to see that to be able to receive the Holy Ghost You' come to see that to be able to be seen tonight you did not just come man did not bring you here brother not bring you here God brought you here the Holy Ghost brought you here you've got to understand that shout amen hallelujah praise God Amen so Jesus 30 days was aligning events of that day with prophecy because the confusion was these guys were Believers but they don't have revealed Faith they had faith in Jesus Peter had faith in Christ Peter said thou are the Christ there was a revelation but it was not a revealed Faith because it did not understand the scriptures praise God hallelujah they could not see the scripture in action so on the third day of the Resurrection they were walking around and they were complaining how there was a man that was supposed to be called Jesus how this man said thought he should res again they did not know that Jesus Christ had already died they did not know exactly where they were at did not know that we are almost in the land of Charity Hallelujah they did not know that the Holy Ghost was about to fall they did not know that charity was only 10 days away praise God Amen can you imagine that charity was only 10 days away and they did not know where they were at they were still asking questions this man said rise again and today is the third day nothing has happened then Jesus Christ was working with them the Bible says their eyes with that they should not know him thank God tonight your eyes are not withhold you will know Jesus because I know charity the spirit of God is hanging over you right now charity is not far from you charity is close to your heart that's how I feel tonight praise God hallelujah can you believe that charity this great promise of God that they were looking for was only 10 days away and they were still confused don't know where they are at don't know their position Jesus was walking with them but they could not see Jesus Faith was not revealed then Jesus Christ had to Blas them say oh ye fools and St to believe all that the prophets have said and he began to expound the scriptures he began to open their understanding that they must understand the scriptures he to align the effect of the day they might know where they praise God let their eyes open let their understanding open breath on them receive the Holy Ghost then they were are placed under the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that is what I came to do to place you under the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is close to you you shall be seal you shall be healed young people your day is come your season is come hallelujah praise God very important there important so outside of that understanding they could not have been placed in a position to believe for charity because if they kept believing that Jesus Christ had died and he did not rise how could he have faith to bring down the Holy Ghost so in meetings like this you just don't come here you came here to receive something from God but you have to be in a position you have to know who you are you have to understand your place you are not a Pentecostal chicken you are God's e you are anointed for the day shout amen praise God hallelujah there's nothing against you nothing against your soul Hallelujah so important is important knowledge so that can only flow out we can recognized by a revealed Faith where we are at because the prde for this age is predestinated to receive the Holy Ghost on the top of the pyramid you you can be in Paul's position the Holy Ghost today you can be in arous position or in Luther's position and get the Holy Ghost today placed you positionally on top of the pyramid that is your foundation that's your place so me you we are predestinated to receive the Holy Ghost from the seventh step somebody say amen that's how peculiar you are that's how important you are important in the eyes of God you and the Omega prde all the other bride ages they are waiting for you to have the understanding that you are on the seven step say Amen to that church you are not coming to it you are there already you just need to recognize it you just need to understand it because God put a seed in your soul to operate on the seven step that's why I preach the way I preach because I recognize I am not preaching on Paul's Foundation I'm preaching on a top foundation I'm preaching the word from the top of the pyramid the sick can be healed the blind can seecer can disappear demons can leave hallelujah praise God no demon power no demon power can hold you tonight the power of God the spirit of God will set you free because why you [Applause] are GL hallelujah hallelujah glory to God okay God has set in the church so we need to have virtue and knowledge to be able to teach the word teach means to impact is an imputation it's not some teaching by explaining because the minister will teach you on virt and knowledge when virtue comes from upon you it doesn't explain it's an interpretation you feel the Holy Spirit come upon you the power of God hallelujah praise God so God is going to impact hallelujah hallelujah teach those who are the those those who have recognized that for this age God's grace and mercy not by their works not because you tried but God grace and mercy my predestination has placed you on the seven St praise God hallelujah all the other all the other Church ages they are all under you they are all waiting for you praise God to come to the realization of who you are when the pride know who she is the rure will go tonight I know who I am let you know who you are praise God hallelujah don't let the devil tell you you are not a son of God because the devil is lying you are a son of God you are eloh you came from Elohim you going back to Elohim don't let the devil tell you you cannot be healed don't let Satan tell you you cannot be free there a lying demon the Holy Ghost told me that tonight somebody here it's going to be healed somebody heal is going to be seal hallelujah praise God and God cannot [Applause] glory for God has set in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelist all for the perfec all [Music] toes means strength so faith is strength knowledge is strength for temperance isance for this virtues in the becomes God at strength so I came to bring you strength the body of Jesus hallelujah praise God Isaiah 96 us son is given his name Shall be Called wonderful his name shall be the government be upon hallelujah praise God the shoulder and the shoulder is the body so God's God's word manifest in when the word come to your when the word is more real in your flesh than sickness when the word is not real Sin is real that drugs and addiction when the word is more real sex that's the word in your flesh God hallelujah praise God hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah now listen close proceed you have to understand the Holy Ghost how the Holy Ghost operates the Holy Ghost is amen amen you understand that understand who you are what the prophet said about you about the state of your soul that was the voice of God talking to you said if you God's Bride for this day you came straight from elohim's thought God has you know these things if your faith is not anointed you can believe that you just you just explain intellect so that's where the voice comes in the faith has got to be anointed so believe I came from Elohim you by your you byass the logos now the L is also called voice world when elohim's attribute elohim's thought when God expressed his thought God materialized himself into voice words the L is not written word that was God's written bible up in heaven word [Music] in when God speaks it goes as a voice because your word is a voice your voice is a word your voice carries a words spoke it went out as a voice the voice of God so John one man reads the word there is logos but to make it really Spirit you have to call that logos voice word so you know it is not just written it's God's voice that's beginning before God created angels before there was a demon this was how you began Elohim became voice then God expressed you as a word Lo that's the seven thund of Revelation they utter their voices where did those voices go they did not go into the Aires went back toos seal those voices into the word that is why you have to find the seven th back in the world voice is slided back into the world but those seven voices that was God expressing your name in the world so that makes you a hidden Mystery in the words so your name is not is not Jones It's Not Your name is a mystery so all God does he shows the mystery that we are by faith wece the mystery that is your name so you are a mystery in God somebody shout amen woo oh Hallelujah I'm excited [Applause] [Music] [Applause] tonight so you are a hiden mystery in God you are God's thought hidden in the word and God's thoughts are his attributes those attribut are his nature so you are the book in the book you are thoughts hidden in the book so you can't see my name in the Bible you can't see my name as because my name is a mystery your name is a mystery sh the word don't know who you are it's only trying to guess he does understand who you are car a mystery in you aables you to receive the Holy Ghost now listen to listen shouting tonight it it's not the shouting that brings out the Holy Ghost the devil also shout but there's a there there is a in you when you shout something happens when you shout something happen that is theery that is theery that is theery when you jump something happens Hallelujah that is the mystery that is the mystery hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah the preacher it is not the preaching that makes something happen the preacher cares a mystery also preach but it Go a mystery that's why some people shout and get [Music] nothing some people they [Music] soan because theer is God there's God in you there's a in you so tonight that mystery will make you receive the Holy Ghost that mystery will see you tonight that mystery will heal you tonight of mystery shout amen tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when I receive the holy ghost3 I did all this Mysteries I didn't know all this message I was not even in the message yet I just raised up my hands preer said raise up your hand I just raised my hands anybody else could raise their but when I raise my hands something happened but God just let me know recently that it was not because I raised my hand when I raiseed my hand I activated the mystery and that mystery brought the Holy Ghost so tonight Hallelujah you can activate the tonight because I know you're going to be seal your time has come to be seal we going to stop strugging with SE people sin is going to be terminated today after you leave this for is going to after thise every is going to after this meeting add going to you young people this is your season you [Applause] that God has not planted the Holy Ghost is to our has noted the tonu it tonight upro it tonight ipro it tonight you can tonight the Holy Ghost tonight hallelujah praise God [Applause] something is happening tonight to you look within yourself mysty is been activated tonight that was the mystery that was the Salvation that was why when you confess the Lord was not the confession but because we are predestinated there was a hidden Mystery there that's why no man can be like you no one can impersonate you because your mystery makes you pear no man can imitate you because your mystery makes you pecul Myster of God this season things are going to happen to you hallelujah praise godu the Holy Ghost is going to activate the mystery in your mystery all promises are in your Myster sh am am so now listen you will not be able to have faith do you know who you are God Super Connect you to this hidden Mystery this hidden power that lays inside of you I was in Cong some years back and his wife went to theel room he said he want the Holy Ghost so I encourage him to receive the Holy Ghost I said go to the meeting in faith if you a seed of God there's aery lay there I give the Holy Ghost but God has predestinated you put a inside of you that mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory hiden mystery as God unfolds the mystery to you you know exactly who you are God is trying to connect you to this mystery that lays inside of you the Myst of God that she might know not an ordinary person you are not AI you are not a Nigerian you are too strong you are too powerful you are not an you did not come from you came from El you came fromom Hallelujah [Music] so that service he went to the meetings he said his wife and I was just preaching the word he had a gift of prayer it was a mystery that when he prayed something happened there was a mystery others can pray hours and hours and hours Happ but most times when the answer comes emphasize how much we pray we keep talking if I didn't happen we emphas the first thing I fasted 21 days you don't see others have also faster than you and they get nothing so we are not really conscious of this hidden Mystery that lay inside of you the Bible said he said a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bring for good things and an evil man evil of his heart bring it for everything is inside of so Revelation is not God telling you things that you don't have you can't believe in what you don't have Revelation help to recognize what you have inside of you what is ration makes you recognize what God has done inside of you you come to these meetings you recognize I'm a Son of God I'm a Child of God God has to give the Holy Ghost I'm going to be healed to recognize that that is what call reveal [Applause] [Music] face Glory so therefore when Falls it will fall as the father's kindness the kindness that's your part nature the pyamid you see all those seven they all had the nature of God that was God dividing his nature seven Church ages but God took back those natures and put it back into the Holy Spirit making God's nature in agreement with his mind what we Byers our is not in agreement with our mind that makes it hard to have [Music] faith because if your mind is not in agreement with your nature you find it had to believe so you have to come back to that order where your mind runs in the dire of your faith which is in your soul then God backs that up so you have the SE of God in your soul but the devil messed up your mind because he knew before 21 when God will save you he must have messed up your mind with Fallen Angel Spirits messed up your emotions you don't feel good you feel oppressed when there supposed to be a SE of God in you when the Bible says we're raised up in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we raised above principalities they supposed to be feeling good and high but your emotions are so messed up you are feeling bad you feel oppressed and the devil through the years has allowed your emotions to dictate your thinking so it makes you think in accordance with your emotions that is how you talk so when your emotions tells you you're sick because you feel sick and your emotions that feeling of malaria or diabetes that feeling prod a thinking in you that when I feel this way it means I am sick then you say I am sick but that is not true your emotions are not supposed to dictate your thinking because you are Elohim thought you're supposed to think like eloh El says by SCP you we are healed that's how to think hallelujah praise God Elohim says there's nothing against you that of things El says your name is in the Eternal and under no circumstance that is how to think you don't have to think the other way around so the devil has worked on our [Music] mind because before we got saved we had no fight in our minds ours was a man so while you sleep when you were in a sleep mode sleep for lack of Revelation the devil came and and after God has woken you up you just realizing now that the enemy has s bad in your mind there some wrong in your mind messed up your emotions people tell you Pastor I am depressed I am depressed you are not depressed you are not oppressed because your feelings feelings of Oppression has dictated your thinking you are not supposed to think like a depressed person because you are not depressed hallelujah hallelujah you are not depressed you're free you're supposed to be happy you're supposed to receive Jo hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah huj so we think in line with our emotions if we have if we have negative about the brother we allow our feelings to tell us that something else wrong with the brother we judge people by the way we feel about them you can just be my feelings those you feel good about to you the good people and those feel bad about because your feelings controls your thinking for me my feelings don't control my thinking the word of God controls my thinking when I feel sick I say I am healed when I feel said I am happy I don't allow my emotion toct my thinking because I came from eloh El thoughts in the mind of God I not a sinner in the mind of God I'm not a fornicator the mind of God hallelujah hallelujah praise God now listen young people this is for you your emotions that's why it's so hard to be delivered because you allow your emotions that is how the devil has trained it trained you very well the devil for one day you shall be called respect all his years to make sure your [Music] emotions now you finding it difficult to believe the word when the word says you are blameless when you feel like smoking [Music] your feelings because those feelings has given you thought so the thoughts is what has to change you must reverse the process when your thoughts change the emtions will change like a A Hallelujah hallelu you think I'm a Son of God I'm a Child of God service the power of God God's power is going to impact your spirit to feel stronger the of God going real to [Music] you holiness is going to be real to you sanctification will be real to you that living in the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is tonight going to EMP you seven from Glory let me tell you something I told my church I told them all these years we preach inspiration but we have not taken time to preach on the issues of life we are not handled the issues what I am preaching now is [Music] issue it's not just inspiration you have the understanding how to handle the devil how to squee Satan your life God is empowering you squee the devil [Music] are powerless Hallelujah [Applause] powerless we have not spent time to preach the of the blood to speak of the ele El that makes the blood to prach the Book of Life as an issue life is an issue issues issues of cond of God put a tool [Music] Victorious hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah many of us come to the inspiration even with the Holy Ghost we are not Faithfully Tau to hand the h Spirit the holy GH is life you have to study it it's your compion when you receive the Holy Ghost BEC your friend you have to understand your friend like if you have a friend you must take your time to understand your friend that friendship to continue so the Holy Spirit you have to understand what the Holy Ghost is how the Holy Ghost operates you know you have the Holy Ghost ho ghost is a life if it's a life it has it own issues has it own issues has it own issues life of God it own issues the issues issues are the elements that goes to make that life we have not taken time but this season the Holy Spirit told me I spent years with the Holy Spirit made mistakes with the Holy Spirit tried to understand how the Holy Ghost operates so the devil can't tell me I don't have the Holy Spirit because I made a mistake no say to that Church of God is hallelujah praise God he is my friend he is my comforter he is my help he is my advocate he is my everything he is my he is my peace tonight friend holy spirit will be your friend will be your advocate comfor trth [Applause] we have not spent time to understand the Holy Ghost it's like a man that was his wife to to a Pentecostal church and his wife told him you have to shout and speak in Tong to have the Holy Ghost didn't know re the Holy Ghost he went to the chur he shed just the same the Holy Ghost what happened to you the first reive Christ my wife is a good PC one day he told me to go to to a church I went there something happened to me something came to me but my wife said I must speak that was when he came in he didn't even know it somebody say Amen to that church you know why don't understand the Holy Ghost for a prophet the Revelation ho ghost is the Holy Ghost is given ghost is given forh Advocate God hallelujah praise [Applause] God have spending time to preach of the issues of life in the book and God has blessed them tremendously addictions in people years to break with the understanding of Life how to understand their emotions and their thoughts God them devil is not that powerful as you think devil is powerless season when the Holy Ghost comes ministry will impact wisdom by virt and knowledge not just carrying on we speak wisdom to them that are perfect those who are mature that wisdom is an imputation of virt and knowledge knowledge how to use the power effectively to give your life over the [Music] enemy without proper knowledge knowled to dire to power and that is wisdom so a man of wisdom has enough knowledge to control Power praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise God so that's the wisdom that the Holy Spirit Will impart it to you the gift of God will come the Min as a needle the needle where the Prophet you know the needle put on the [Music] records says those men will have a chip of Christ in them that chip of Christ will be a needle and they will read out the hiden Mysteries of your life like it was a from Christ he could read the life of the people he had wisdom how to handle the enemy so that same wisdom it can't come by explaining the scriptures anymore it comes with the Revelation the voice of God will imp wisdom in you what to do how to do it to put sat under control so even tonight you may be feeling sick in your body whatever it is tonight that sickness does not exist as far as God is concerned it doesn't exist if you can
