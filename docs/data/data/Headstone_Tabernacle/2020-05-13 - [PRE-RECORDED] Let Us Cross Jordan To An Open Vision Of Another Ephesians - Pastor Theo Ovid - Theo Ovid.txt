to match something much experience against Paul's that's what we need is a match in time but Paul's faith in the Bible that's an example right real match in time don't try to match enable match some of the scenes of the Bible are you ready and if you are sinned act like a saint walk like a saint dress like a scene talk like a saint pre like a saint believe like a saint shout like a saint be like

come from the dust and that does go right back to the dust but at Jean and not your soul that come from God isn't that right o blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm excited this morning I talked about for last week's service I really thoroughly enjoy that about being focus going back past giggle and Bethel and Jericho and pressing your way to that purpose in God for your life and something ought to call you the press and masterfully Balaram says a person can't get desperate and cold until God speaks to them and you come here for God to speak to you amens a lot of stand as we want to go into the word want to turn to 2nd Kings chapter 2 wanna read from verse 6 to eat Joshua chapter 1 wanna read verse 1 2 3 and 3 6 I wanna read Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 and verse 14 so that's cool to second Kings to 6 and Elijah said unto him took tokens begin the Elijah Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as I so live it I will not leave thee and the two went on and fifty of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view a foul and a two stood by Jordan and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smooth the waters and they were divided hither and thither surah d2 went over on dry ground Joshua chapter one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord came to pass that the Lord speak unto Joshua the son of nun Moses the minister seen Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan and DA and all these people unto the land which I do give unto them even to the Journal of Israel every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses verse 6 be strong of a good courage for on to dis people shall doubt divide foreign inheritance the land which I swear on to their fathers to give them let's look at Matthew chapter 4 read in verse 1 then we go to verse 14 then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil verse 14 okay okay oh praise the Lord okay sorry it's supposed to be Luke actually Luke chapter 4 verse 1 and verse 14 I'm sorry Luke chapter 1 and Jesus being Luke chapter 4 verse 1 and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness verse 14 and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit unto Galilee and they went out a Fame of him wrong about throughout all the regions wrong about let us pray father we thank you for your word and we pray your calm down and especially and speak to our hearts in Jesus name I ask it amen and he made you may be seated oh praise the Lord so I guess I was looking at those two scriptures what does them have it better I wanted to get that one and somehow and the patina Matthew amen I have a title this morning let us cross Jordan to an open vision of another Ephesians let us cross Jordan to an open vision of another Ephesians and have an inspiration before the bride returns in power that is what my inspiration is before the bride returns in power now I want you to turn your Bibles to first John chapter 2 I want you to follow me with this context scripture reading from verse 15 to 16 first John chapter 2 reading from verse 15 to 16 and John is right after Peter we was 15 cents love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever I want to read that one again for all the 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world may God bless his word and praise God blessed be the name of the Lord and this is brother Branham from God called man he was saying before prayer I would like to ask this question to people inside out how many in here sincerely would like to go with Jesus down to Jordan tonight and dear cross over there where you could see a vision and see what God really means would you raise your hands god bless you go down to Jordan not down to a seminary Elijah pass right by that tyree here I don't want to that's man-made it's never quenched that taste of a man who is testing for God a seminary or information can never quench that tooth that a man have for God he says what we need you can get men all to themselves away from their school of theology are we from their self-styled ways fearless men men of character with you who believes you and take you at your word and he's praying God many of them standing here present that will give all they got to the Lord Jesus and sello the world go pass Giga the place of confession and Christian beginnings go pass school of the prophets not set back there with theology and go to Jordan to an open vision and when the cross and find that God still lives do you believe that oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord but the trouble today is that ministers very few ministers are trying to establish Christ in the people's heart very few ministers is trying to do that they are trying to establish themselves their ministry who they are their idea their interpretation very few are establishing the Word of God isn't that right because Eve had a lust that loss was foreknowledge is not right and but a banna me spoke about that isn't that right it was wrong for her to do that and we finally what happened there isn't that right and the ministers today supposed to be established in Christ in the people's heart not the church not their ministries not their ideas but Christ and crisis the world so once the word is preached without being flavored and have an interpretation to it you are getting Christ the word because in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God isn't that something else so Jesus Christ isn't that right when he was 12 years old he knew he was about the father's business he was in the channel of the will of God he was a son 12 years old no you know I must be about my father's business it take him 18 years to ripen that comment the position to be positionally place by the pillar of fire by charity at the Jordan River could somebody see a man is not right so during those years of silence he was an idol he was doing something he was in the world we attend to fulfill the word Juno's eight years of silence Jesus was getting a revelation of what the father has to work for his life Oh glory to God in many many many men glory to God they come back if it will faker Ison you want to get the lengthen drive a car leash 18 or whatever and you want it you have to get the information first how you go up or get them man you're getting your documents it gets in your ID card and so on and then you have to find out you have a booklet of the regulations that you have to pass you have to get a deed set but you're not a driver yet did not approve yet did not confirm yet when you get your learner's know you get to go and get you test drive and so on but you're not the proof yet yes there's a pass a test in the yaw to see if we can reverse well under your three-point turn and then if you don't pass there you can't even go out so you've got to pass the first test before you go out in the road because you have a weapon call a car and the car lose you just like that and you kind of drive so they have to test you first and when you pass the inside test you're going for the outside test and then you get approved but that's what we're talking about you could sit and study home to drive what kind of have to drive if you don't go and pass to the process you are not writing to drive because somebody say man you can preach how nice driving is you can explain how to do it but until you go and do it then do it yet so before you come back in power there is something has to take place before this super church and super race and purple and spoken word and doing this and doing that I when the press come down wants to tell them before all of that or get the Lord a shelter before all of that [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just before all of that we want to get down to that this morning oh praise God amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah originally in Genesis the instructions was for man to have dominion over the fish beasts birds what spirit man Genesis - there was no - of the soil but that real man Remis always a real man real man was no flash man real man was spirit man and God word real man into freshman man became a living soul but the original real man was spirit man spirit was leading man no we are man leading but it was very pleasing man now we are flesh leading or give the Lord a shoulder press so if let me see that if we're gonna come back to Genesis if we're gonna come back to original we have to get back to where the split leads man Jesus was led by the spirit come on out come on out where he was going in the spirit Oh hallelujah he was going to power but yet I brought the pass [Applause] alleluiah he was led by the spirit into the wilderness so Jesus come on you have to demonstrate he had power over himself before his ministry could take off because he put any final gear to let that engine Rumble through before that car took off he added us to demonstrate he had power over himself because John described all that is in the world all that is in the world is either under lust of the eyes it's either on the lusts of the flesh or it's under the pride of life every sin every wickedness every evil is under one of that I'm not hearing you this morning I'm not hearing you this morning every issue be a government their kingdoms be it family their neighbors being on the job is one of them [Applause] most of the ass lust of the flesh and the pride of life Oh hallelujah somebody said break it down like that hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory to God thank you Jesus proverbs 6 1619 these six things that God heap yeah seven are an abomination to him number one a proud look here said pride alone because we could see pride you see somebody can walk with pride and people don't know that's on the inside because they can walk with a head door and the proud but God hid a proud look that has to do with the pride of life that have to do with you feeling superior to others and you seen others inferior to you come on Sam and somebody god it's believers in the house [Applause] Oh glorious a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises wicked imaginations feet that be swift around the mischief of false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren God hates that God hates that you see you don't have to be agree with me to be my bedroom we don't have to have the same doctrine to be brethren I'm telling you I am not hearing you even families have fights different brothers and sisters have fights brothers and brothers have fight the services of a fight brothers family will be a ports family let's fight [Music] or give the Lord a shout inside of here Oh blow me love God give the Lord a show yes you heard right let's fight but after the fight is over we are still family [Applause] come on now come on Oh same as somebody let's fight for what is right let's fight for the faith that was once delivered we are gonna fight we pledge to love the president Oh hallelujah glory glory decorum and amen Oh glory to God you may not like me but I love God you may not like me but I love the word I'm not here if I like and compassed represent the kingdom Oh hallelujah which Kingdom the kingdom of the Most High God or get the law some Prince's people [Applause] Oh hallelujah [Applause] all right you may be seated this is actually a continuation from last week so if you didn't give us we keep get it go and hear it you need to hear it oh my glory hallelujah I want to look at Luke for a little bit could find it you do have to find it Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan Jordan seemed to be connected to all this sing boy lies you have to put on Jordan Jesus hid this Jordan Jesus of the hidden Jordan oh my Joshua had to cross Jordan what what is beyond dis Jordan why we have to go past Jordan why why because none of the banks and just watch over yonder Oh hallelujah why is that because Jordan represents death Jordan represent a new day in your life when you cross Jordan is a new inspiration is a new you have that past this may be for if any man be enticed is a new new create shorter Jesus full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the ministers Association and toured a bit on the world no he was inspired to call a convention to discuss his Jordan no he was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he eat nothing and when they were ended he hungered here we go lust of the flesh he is hungry and the devil come while you hungry the temp Jesus the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone to be meat bread you could do it as language there's only stones all wrong and if you are who you are which know you could do something but Jesus wasn't commanded to follow the instructions or the leaving of sita jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God he overcame the lust of the flesh by the word he is gaining dominion over himself that that cannot be enslaved the hip and sleeve him watch Dever take him up to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of tang lust of the eyes what a temptation what you I could see oh this is mine I guess the Devi had never had a projected here and he was a cool scream the extreme and all the kingdoms of this fools and mine and the Devas another him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will give it he's talking big he's not talking like if he doesn't have it he no in charge and he said yeah you know me I could fix you right if tho therefore will worship me all shall be dying what he was seeing with his eyes jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only go shalt serve [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now Satan going down deep he'd know man I mean is hundreds of years have been delivered man man love himself a lot it could be very proud and he brought him to Jerusalem Sita set him on a pinnacle of a temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from there another word sure sure who you are because it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee now if you take that head thing if you take that basket as with us enjoy that if you take that basket as a descriptor see so it's written on your Quincy everybody look for the angels to hold me he's gonna feel like this but Jesus stole the devil and in their hands what you decide the ID uh police at any time no sir - I fought against a stone so the devil listen if you not we need scriptures devil is [Applause] because he could quote it back to try to tie up and Jesus said ancestor unto Him it is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and when the devil was ended all the temptation he departed from him a season and I hope we get to verse 14 so before you return in power all that is in the world you have to face the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life hallelujah but you are going to overcome because there's a prophecy that the bride will cross Jordan and quadriceps future joshua's to take the people over Jordan you don't have to cost Rowland alone so the bridge hallelujah didn't either Oh blessed be the name of the Lord Laurie Lazar so Jesus proved he had control and dominion over his human spirit by overcoming the lust of the ants by overcoming Ellis of the flesh by overcoming the pride of life isn't that right and before adopted son can have dominion over others and other things you must display the meal over yourself therefore it doesn't matter what church you go to doctrine doesn't change you your behavior does come on save me somebody oh yes oh yes people believe because what they believe will take them true but around them teach that he say a got to apply the talkin Branham Tabernacle hallelujah you can't say I believe a prophet you believe Moses and you're not applying the blood Moses said take a lamb Moses said kill the lamb Moses said take the blood Moses said apply the blood and the blood shall be upon or when I see the blood I'm gonna pass over you that's what Moses said Oh glory to God I can't tell you what I feel after tell you what God said come on Sam and somebody I can feel sorry for you but what did God say [Applause] we're not cause the dressings by our feelings and by emotions we are called are just things by the word and the word only sobre Romney must be born again you said you might get up

will never quit lust enough to follow many morally dressed when you see them on the street instead of telling your heads and walking away you will still lust right on just the same because you are alive with the world but when that sacrifice has been received you [Applause] he didn't say when you fast he didn't say when you pray he didn't say when you call him some Hill on some mountain

warfare in the world the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life you can't run from it you can't hide from it you've got to over comment but greater is He that's in you that's he does

happened in the gang Oh hallelujah Genesis chapter 3 if you want to turn your Bibles find it way in the word this morning let's see what happened let's see the technique that the devil use and see if this is all that is in the world hallelujah honey bombard here let's see what happened back there oh praise God hallelujah Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden so he gave a coat he saw the printout and the woman said on the woman we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it Lisa died and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know in the day you eat your eyes here we go shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil listen to how the Bible described it when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes food lust of the flesh pleasant to the eyes lust of the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise kind of life she took the fruit thereof did eat give also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves apron and they heard the voice of the Lord walk in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord and among the trees of the garden and the Lord called unto Adam and said unto him where dogs that I heard a voice in the garden I was afraid he's because I was naked and I hid myself he said who told it I was naked who told you that I was naked you may be seated Oh glory to God but the point is this because he they were filled by the Holy Ghost but I said the Holy Ghost over them they didn't know they were naked Oh glory to God hallelujah you understand that they were really in the spirit [Applause] they didn't know they were naked so when the devil got Easter break then that feel fall off for them then they finally self hide in Oh hallelu so this lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and pride of life is nothing new it's all that is in the world Oh blessed be the name of the Lord could be going forward now

this noise about God fulfilling his promise word again version 10 107 in the days of the seungyun of the seven angels message the mystery of God shall be finished there we go are you ready the hidden mystery of revelation 10 one two seven the last message to the last to change what is revision 10 107 the last message to the last inch is the seven thunders the angel came down not with the book closed with six seals but people open that me all seven seas was pulled back to the injection with the book open and seven thunders show their voices Oh hallelujah that was a message that will travel bright together oh they're bright how to be pure give the bride sweet that was that message right there that is the last message for evil God give the Lord a shout of praise cap is the capstone revelation of Jesus Christ [Applause] LeBron I'm calling the last message exactly fulfill the day when the Sun will reveal Laurie's interchange this messenger Malachi for relish intense Emmys I want

seven seals it will be DS divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the churun back to the Pentecostal fathers so in other words you ready come the river thunders and a tunnel to go till he has back to the faith and fathers isn't that right do you believe that hallelujah so then we go back to paradox I only know about Danny Henry I'm butter brown spoke some things and it came across in French I was interpreted and this was spoke to the Prophet because thou hast chosen the heart away the narrow path the heart away that was walked in your own choosing in other words I didn't have to do it I could cite and go with them if I want to but I stayed but what would the wood that was picked the correct precise decision it is my way watch the Hardaway God say he's choosing he choose the right thing Oh hallelujah that means he wasn't using with his eyes or his emotions or his feelings he choose the way of God oh that's why you have to overcome the lust of the eyes what didn't happen a lot when God told Abraham all this is yours he tell not to choose after before go tell Abraham that he tell not to choose and the Bible said go and look to what suddam his eyes saw his eyes saw the nice water claims the word Sodom and LA and up in Sodom Abraham had the wilderness and whatnot but God said look to the east west north and south all is yours he uses eyes what are you using this morning what do you see in this morning Oh hallelujah so much as Church foolishness to just flesh and blood not even seeing God he do she do he see dempsey and what that said a nonsense have nothing to do with the program of God to see what courts program is look at look at Jacob when they get back home he's studying his brother I want to kill him good I'm Jacob doing this he sent money what I super water but I'm richer than me he sent his wife this way and what not he split them all up until what caught him a loon I went got caught Jacob alone then the injured could talk to him minister to him and he could wrestle with the angel and he knew what he wanted because he knew he can face his brother his money can help him its popularity again his work can help him nothing could help him unique what could help him and he massively angel all night long you know what he did he overcome he overcame angels coming morning I've gotta go yes I will not let you go until you bless me where you're going the car go anywhere I'm too desperate I can't leave it a semi came I've got to get a breakthrough I'm not gonna let you go [Applause] and then he was touched he was touch that one saying you gotta get experience Jordan is an experienced or I'm gonna say it again Jordan he's an experienced Jordan and no football gymnastic team flipping about Jordan and exhausting about Jordan no Jordan is and Jordan no no no Jordan experienced Jacob was touched it make him walk different started walk with a limp no that's embarrassing that you're walking with a limp walking like an old man but he was changed God's ain't no longer Jacob change the name and oil walk with a new name Israel is a name Oh glory to God how could he become Israel will overcoming how could he might walk in normal normal I am Israel I'm Israel home because you say so [Applause] because your mouth says oh you fix this ever better than you name anybody could do that you could go and get papers change but you overcome nothing you're right isn't a piece of paper get it approved by the government but that is not what Jacob getting he overcome he wrestled all night long Gaza for this overcoming I can leave you there every overcome I must have something the confirm is overcoming you overcome the lust of the eyes you overcome the lust of the flesh you overcome the pride of life something has to happen to you you have to come back in power the pasta girl you pass pass help you pass Jericho you come to Jordan you come back empty yes I come back with the same room you have to come back where is the Lord Coronel idea you have to come back and get a testimony the spirit Elisha drop press the pony like shock Oh glory hallelujah okay let me just see if I could just finish this off here because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee and I think and I wondered when I die will it be then it happened to take heaven that portion different portions of deer have missed the king of heaven that's within us that once what weird for what a glorious isn't ours mean this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine and we see a tremendous friction love divine here we go do you see what comment on to the Jordan meant we are down here now let's cross over now let's quit playing let's cross to the other side now because it all belongs to us it's all ours them visions never failed they can't feel because they come from God I believe who's all as if with within me we are not the Harlan that will run back to the wilderness we will cross Jordan prophecy the separation then he says God bread to us the seals that's on the back of the book let us enter into this great place now for Joshua divided to the people the inheritance that God has left for them so he put the tunnels that's the best of the book right that Jordan Oh hallelujah praise God isn't that right do you believe that so there is where the thunders is that the seven thunders is that Ephesians when you cross over you have to cross over into the pandas and the thunders will produce another Ephesians the ton that's my revelation suppose the leaders the Calvary supposed to lead us that depth herself we have to have power over stuff before we are power over others or blessed be the name of the Lord you should come up please God requires a Jordan in every life this one quad-core man God requires a Jordan in every life listen son and daughter listen mother father husband wife you cannot continue living for you and call that Jordan whatever you want whatever you feel whatever is your desire you get it and if you don't get it you misbehave or your carry on because you kind of get your own way God requires a Jordan every life so you like to come around and said d'lita woman I you're a young man the old prophet was trying to try them out you're a young man you haven't had much schooling it's really you haven't had a grammar school education all you know is how to plow you better stay here and get a bachelor art degree not Elijah not that man who once touch God and felt the power of the anointing upon him he said as the Lord lives on your soul never dies I'll never leave you he had a purpose he saw the vision he know what was gonna take place and they both went down to Jordan Jordan means death they stand there the old man under young man it really represent Christ in His Church and dare they stood by the Jordan Jesse is coming out of the Judean Hills the great ripples roaring Elijah which is great here hanging on his back his doom all eyes looked across Jordan and a young man watching every movie made one day young man here we go are you ready was written for a vision to carry out the will of God the other one was going home I love this Frieza they were put at Jordan I just love those words there they were both at Jordan I just love that statement one is going one looking for vision to do the will of God and the Pope that Jordan Oh hallelujah that is what he later told Elijah the Lord had called me across Jordan hallelujah and the two went on or give the Lord some praises people oh my I want to close but I want to just can I wrap up here listen this suffer some say from other was it Moses listens brother Brown I think a minister today that's call of God to step into the tracks where Jesus should what a commission but each that's call of God is Commission to stand in the same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each minister called to stand where he would the works that I do shall you also each minister ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command not just talk but perform the duties Oh hallelujah watch how it must have felt when just my standing in the morning when God said I would not feel you know leave thee therefore I will destroy a Levite and make a week clear for you now there is a great lot of types to go into that Moses was not permitted to take the turn over because he had filled and the church organizations denomination has filled and that's like whatever is up a Joshua generation because all what Moses did it came to a dead end and it couldn't cross so God had to take out Moses of the scene here this part God Disick Eliezer will raise up a new system and interdenominational system by the power of God by the power of God that will take the church into the Promised Land organization denomination has messed it up each one after the own theology each one after the own way of thinking but God will take his holy spirit and will raise his Joshua that will take the church to the promise with no the nominal strings string tied it at all God called ministers author not to be stuffed up a theology but has visited the land to where they're gonna bring back evidence of divine love and power of the Lord Jesus to make known to the congregation that there's a land beyond the river and this is something but a prince had preached he said when we get to the river it divides and separate us once on the other side here we go something happens to you know Joshua in all this knowing that the command was great but having the assurance he could be fearless he could be we call it reckless as long as he was pointed the right way so kind of Church of the Living God be rictus and fearless if the feet is pointed in the right way Oh glory to God amen isn't that right so the first stage is coming out of the land then the second see the Sun of the key juncture the blood but the Telex stage is when the cross Jordan into the promised land where the promised slave go and pass them you said no remember you have to pass by your brethren and they are near the border line if you pass by them to see nothing to them I have given Esau this mountain I have given more of this country I don't want you fussing with them pressure lighten just move true gently you know where you're going don't take up their habits notice not the teachings and of their habits which is their behavior I give Esau this mountain don't touch him I've got something for you cross over and I'm gonna close with this that's my desire brethren to see my church cross over into another land a desire to move over to the other side if there's something a new here first call in there be something to respond to that call just settle down the ship reason enough for you go into some sort of business for you just a joint Church put your name in a book is
