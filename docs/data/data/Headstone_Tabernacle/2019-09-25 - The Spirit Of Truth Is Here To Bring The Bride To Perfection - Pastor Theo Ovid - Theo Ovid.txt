Holy Spirit from partial realization in the perfect realization of who they are in God granted Father in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen god bless you welcome tonight my channel and shake somebody next to you somebody Jesus name email and when we want to look at tree portion scriptures tonight all in the book of John's in John 14 and John 15 and st. John 16 tonight we want to read us in John 14 verse 15 to 20 wanna read one verse in verse of top to 15 wanna read verse 26 as in John chapter 16 to verses there was 12 and 13 praise God cynjohn 14 you wanna read verse 15 to 20 if you love me keep my Commandments this is in red this is Jesus speaking here he said I will pray the Father that he shall give you another comforter so so so Jesus was the comforter that was there but he's talking about another comforter and Jesus was the wood right so he's not talking about the wood as a comforter he's in another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knowing him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless or like orphans I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but he see me because I live he shall live also that day you shall know an arm and my father he and me and I in you since John chapter 15 one verse verse 26 and when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me unless looked at st. John chapter 16 ow verse 12 and 13 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now ho be it when he the spirit of truth is come he would guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come let's play one more time father we have read your word and we already feel a presence here and we are such unneeded people tonight needin you Lord and we pray that you would take me out of the way and circumcise my heart my lips my mouth Lord that I'll speak what you want me to speak circumcise the hairs that I would hear your word only the may not hear an interpretation but may they hear what the Spirit speaks expressly granted Father and Jesus mi ask it email I'm a man god bless you may be seated also good to be here in his presence welcome our title the spirit of truth is here to bring the bride to perfection that's a title the spirit of truth is here to bring the brightness to perfection and the spirit of truth the comforter is here as the guide to bring the bride to perfection hallelujah you ready for the world tonight amen okay here we go for margin divorce but aburana know that the seas are open the Spirit of Truth directs us to the world and that explains why all the Mystics has been dumped rages because the Seas was not open this was not revealed so the open of the seals release the spirit of truth which was a promise to follow the message of the prophet to reveal and show us all things list and guide us into all truth so we supposed to be rejoicing tonight and grateful tonight because you are actually under the Spirit of Truth Oh hallelujah is the Spirit of Truth all these years there's letters in this word of truth to reveal the wood isn't that right remember the beginning the one the only forty five God gave Adam and Eve was to stay behind the world he just missed courted one little phase of it I mean one little phase caused all the trouble sickness heart aches and sorrows one little fees of it keep us all you shall not surely die just one word oh my and something struck me and I don't know if I'll talk about it is Sunday about dark knowledge tact and understanding praise God not getting the right information the right knowledge and this is the age at the Bible talk about knowledge shall increase there is no need for people to be ignorant because full knowledge is unfolded you read must all live in here just type it in google and search it and get it out just not any kind of knowledge - so to do this anything you want to make at the time a mechanic came to me to do some work to fix my car and he couldn't get to me you see something is missing something I went and Google understood I see yeah yeah yeah look at here imagine I tell the mechanic what to do because he couldn't understand where to go from here he come up got a block right there and I could tell him because look somebody show how to do it here I'm not a mechanic but I'm saying it's a shame because the spirit of truth come to direct us to the world the leaders of the goddess into all truth where would God lead us he's a PDF or perfect as a father name is perfect so God not little to church that's like we're agreements that I did not come to build another denomination I come to bring individuals interest - of a perfect man that they might be our house so you can be effectively empowered not just remembered but God anointed God inspired think about it now is that a bad day you know it not know but at that day you shall know that I am the father you and me and I on you so he promised that day is coming Oh glory they reach yet but they're coming that's you're gonna come into who you are and you don't know where I come from where you're going and who you are then the devil if they get permission to mess with you or glory to get the Lord a shout then that change the picture altogether because you are not normal you are not ordinary you not just some Trinidadian your sons and daughters of the Living God hallelujah praise God we believe that so he said God will judge the world not by any certain group he will judge the world by Jesus Christ and Christ is the word Oh glory to God so he's at this group and this group another know the word or glory there's another line up with the group you lined up at the wedding you don't line up it's a neighbor you line up with the word you're not doing what somebody else doing forget what they're doing what does the word say what does the word see any issue how does the word say I'm supposed to be here how we suppose what we supposed to have whatever the word said that what we want we are fighting for this world Oh glory to God we believe that hallelujah praise God Amen hallelujah so God had to release the word first before he released the Spirit Jesus was among them giving them words giving them promises he's I will not leave you comfortless I'm gonna release to you another comforter the world class iam but right now he is with you hallelujah so he's giving you promises okay the Lord I'll get a lot of shout or blowing up gorgeous since the Prophet left the Spirit of Truth has come among us because these defining promises and by these promises we can become partakers of the divine nature so all these have you were hunted for what promises what we will preacher promises not dreams not only ideas promises because these promises watch out to true or glowing of God as well should be prism tonight grateful tonight inside your heart of would sees promises hallelujah praise God praise God so this spirit of truth the recognized to the word was to bring us in the learning of himself he call it that will be in a time of the revelation of these things being made known that you could come into the learning of himself and in learning of himself you will have to learn how to behave yourself or glory the copic or learning of him will bring you into correct behavior and he said the seals opened up we could know how to behave ourselves because the purpose of the seals which is the purpose of the deed is to bring sons back into manifestation and to bring sons back into manifestation is the bring sons back into character which is behavior that the father can identify this is my son in whom I am well pleased I'm not pleased with the store I am pleased with this walk okay the Lord our God hallelujah hallelujah praise God many many many many many man this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased he's not talking about the talk he is talking about the walk you have to walk the talk or get the Lord a shout Oh what we need is thousands of liver cells if they kept precept then you have to live it everybody appreciates tonight but that's the term that are gonna shake the devil there's some real thunder they're on a roll or give the Lord a show I feel inspired tonight glory to God because we are knowing that the Spirit is here and that spirit of truth is we're going to bring you into perfection it's not the spirit of error or get the Lord a shout let me say it again it is not the spirit of error it's the spirit of truth Oh hallelujah all glories are gone so your past can't stop it the failures can't stop it not even your sins could stop it it's coming to you oh give the Lord a shout if it'll shorten that one you in real trouble hallelujah because this bride have to be the word manifested say word manifested say it again will manifested so there's not a bride sitting on opinions on preacher preaching this bride will become the word made flesh all glory to God to hear what I said this bride will become the Word made flesh for four hundred years they were talking scriptures for four hundred years that scribes and Pharisees and Essenes and Sadducees but praise God the eyes higher prophesy the voice of one time a wilderness I went on the Baptist about he came the full run the coming of the Messiah or tell the Lord a shout I'm turned about this one stuck with me flesh or glory to God to introduce the Messiah he said make away and any time Messiah coming you have to make work the harder you have to make away you talk with the Messiah coming toward you in that condition yes away clean up your life clean up your house clean up your mind clean up your painting clean up your attitude because I'm making away you might be seasoned poor glory to God how could you clean to be expecting a blessing and you're not making up with it when God spoke to Abraham an he gon have a child and say rekha have no child it burns a corpse a brahmic McMicken bootie a bomb a crib if I wasn't talking about you know Gautam child nothing there is no evidence of expectation where is your evidence of expectation I tell one minister okay you like to preach now know everything now everything no I say good that's right beside us preacher too I say but sure to be careful that you truly people off the right expectation because you make the people feel there how much I don't have it they wouldn't expect it so if I tell you have it and you have it again praise God you have it to get so if the guidance here you look at my spirit dynamics is here and the form of the spirit of prophecy dynamics is here in the form of the guide the dynamics this year as the form of the comfort of the guide the world that I record the truth the truth will bring it to light or glory to God because the Bible is the roadmap hallelujah and the word have to leave the power is it not being the power something is wrong or glorious God every word leads you into a manifestation get the Lord a shout on that one [Applause] listen when God came at the Moses he say I come down and I come no losses telling people he tested my wisdom God come down we come and for I don't know just calm down God is I come know he's I come down to deliver the object of coming down was to deliver is not information is that isn't a text God come down again taxi come down to do what what is God coming down for why is the angel here what the Angels here for the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is the angel that drives the people back to the world because he can only syndicate the word so if the Holy Spirit comes up in your life he will rock you back to the word nothing either feel good back to the way I shown you early Christian walk and go till I give up things things I was dear to give up yet friends to give up it was painful but you have to do it because was a higher call he call you to meet new people better people and people that you don't know because you become a pilgrim and a stranger or glory to God a people that was not your people become your people o God because we are strangers we seek in our city whose maker and delivery Scott Oh hallelujah bellezza maybe season God's witness the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost itself living in us would never a fee with itself an organization you can't organize God He is God that's why I said notice that all the Holy Ghost it really caught individuals could all the Holy Ghost so you know look at a bunch of scars you don't know who they are hypocrites you don't know make believer you don't know what they are you don't look at that you're looking for Holy Ghost filled oh my hallelujah you can't organize glorious God go back to the beginning watch it we'll go back to the beginning back to the original back the way it started from if you're baptized the same way they did it's pretty sure holy goes the same way it did they will teach the people the same way it did it will stick I've seen from organizations the same way they did and a lot of room for all like the dead who would come there will be clean and like did it they will be filled with the spirit like they were they'll be fearless like they were and the same thing I happen to them will happen to these in the last days that is my contention I want the same thing same penny same power same size no excuses [Applause] want a bigger show than that your promises of the church bench someone give the Lord a show your promise is a nice pasta they know your promise the pasta yet the promise is still true Dodi mamas have a church for the promise the promise is unto you until children the promises the fire promises the Holy Ghost the promise of dynamics the perfection and you have to fight for what you know is yours I don't mind if I have I don't have I don't have I want what God promised and what God promised we'll see you up in the book Oh God Halla will help me tonight that's what the seawall about it was inheritance were sealed up your name was sealed up yeah I know you were sealed up who you are sealed up Oh glory to God so the spirit of truth comes forward to reveal your name do you see who you are to receive where you come from where you're going [Music] my lord help me tonight fermented Esprit that Trudy said on one of the great problems of gopher board Shirley years as a history of the church goes is to find somebody he can completely get in his control he only needs one man you be that man I'm not hearing you I am not hearing you he doesn't need a stretcher no he needs you I'm not having I wanna pee Anna he needs just one just one man you need one man you always use one my mother's time we started a few nights one my another group he just won one that's all he needs cause two men would have two different ideas he just makes one man represent himself to that one person never did he do it otherwise than that no he's got one person today that's beautiful and that person is the one we just read after the Holy Spirit he is the person that God has sent forth the spirit of Jesus Christ in three eart the Spirit of God to manifest and be a Christ through his church and to continue the life of Christ to the church so that church become a channel of communication to reveal God or give the Lord a shot the church becomes a channel to unveil God Oh hallelujah now here he says here when he the Holy Ghost has come and someone said some time ago that the Holy Ghost is actually a mental mind you think that would put the Holy Spirit as a thought but a Bible said when he he's a personal pronoun when he the person the Holy Ghost comes he will reveal these things to you that I have told you Oh glory to God Oh blow you yeah right you ever what Jesus tell them Holy Ghost coming back to reveal what he told them he's an intellectually all glory to God by the Holy Ghost the Spirit of Truth come to the revelation of what you have been hearing you're reading the books you're listening to the tapes but never take the Spirit of Truth to come among the people to bring revelation which is the faith of glory to God upon this rock I'll build my church Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah men say I am some say you like this some say you at that Peter said about the Christ what was Jesus words he said flesh and blood did not reveal that to you what was it the spirit or glory to God that rugged clutzy man that the spirit take a whole upon Peter he was going to deny Christ he wasn't a backslide but that didn't stop the spirit because three the name was in the book you think God when you go back side cause you're knowing I do they're still happy to come to you but that wouldn't cancel anything a concern in your life when you cancel yourself gonna cancel you start canceling out yourself stop let nobody cancel you borden cancel you gotta cancel Saul and he was persecuting the Christian God any counselor Samson when Samson Bathsheba Delilah Gordon canceled David and David fell in sin with Bathsheba or chlorine Akkad don't tell me what canceling you only recall my call to make my through the priests and I or glory to God the spirit of truth is from the Spirit of Truth comforter is here he is comforting you with these words or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God or give the Lord a shout tonight the Holy Spirit is in the building this is a nice this is [Applause] glory you want BC said I need seven the squirrel trees come he will be a witness of him he will speak about him not about some man him price Oh glory to God about glorify Jesus he was the first chapter Gordon sundry times divers manners oh my forgive me no but this is all God give me to present this word this way precise concise to it glory the call beyond the words Therese Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God calling sundry times divers manners stick to the father's to the prophets but in this last day by son Christ Jesus it's the Holy Spirit taking over possession and taking possession of the church to operate Christ in the church then you become as he was he become as you was so you become as he was he become you that you might become him it's above understanding there's no way to explain it don't try just accept it is spoken and suffered just say I believe it Oh Gloria doctor I'm the father there is something you need to know I'm against organized religion he said the Holy Spirit today the manifest in the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because the Holy Spirit will only vindicate the world and I was we wasn't ready for no power yet to do what a bunch of people coming here to see power and Sangha wonders like a backup Pentecostal church I said a fleshly people jumping up looking for miracles like ever signs I kept a blood any hands on in the manifestation no the spirit of true that the come to bring realization the bring our sins our full understanding because the sons of God would be correctly manifested this is no ignorance on this Muhammad that knowledge or technology no decisions on the walking in light this is enlightening sons or glory to God this is sons that might have the mind of Christ because brother Branham came to enter zih and there is no mood for coffee pass the eye next is the intelligence so these are sons that will have God's intelligence or Chloe the God's sons [Music] the intensity consoles of your mighty Oh hallelujah glory to God not knowing just what God did but why God did it that God could reveal as a nun solitaire Suns in the last days that were to declare Jesus Christ you are going to see the manifestation of the sons of God Oh glory to God for my mind my hallelujah so the money person the Holy Spirit is that angel so let me say the angel is here the engine is here to do what I record to do with why the Pentecostal feel they wonder give some different things but they have no life in them they had no word in them so it's a bunch of flesh man man preaching anointed and I've all drunk next day man and early or not the Holy Ghost prophesy next May he was some other woman just flesh just been anointed so cuz I ain't doing that and we're putting a word and men I will use my word in men since that men is me in them if I were inside of them I'm gonna stick it inside of them hallelujah so he put some conditions are wrong it sometime you're gonna sign a contract some fine print and many time yes they look at me find by only sign in sign in you won't sign in alone in a bank watch papers they have you don't read nothing they analyse I will call you wanna money USD fight but I will take your host I would take his car I would take your fridge I could take a stove if you're a pay us or a see boy I need this one titular yes ms:i so I well since I say putting the show yeah but initially for the initial here and sign here and you just do so do so this stamp it and you start Opie stop in any brand new car you sign your card opinion store my son supima I remember time a job somebody stole a car and it didn't read EPO for the car I didn't know that man kennel and I man come and talking him in nice nice I like how their and fronting to you see look like a nice man is icon for that guy I come to repossess that guy I was terrible negotiate and I end up in the guarding was a real trickster I was at use my tricks touch it so the fine print is that character is not activity that's why money never ready help people and the sense of fed them with character as I seem on somebody of a million they're gonna fight because they know somebody had ten million and ten million fine for money so we because I know a man with 50 million I know a hundred million he get a real fight because you don't warm up with a billion dollars in his heart he can sleep good at night he can sleep when you're looking for ten thousand dollars he can't sleep leave a tip on to the only hundred hundred and see if I'm only moving these satisfaction goalposts if you get this you will be satisfied I mean I get it you still grumpy you're still wrapping is still no good so he's shipping on your ship in there when I get this oh boy everybody was see and I go see my house it was he pissed it was he done I'm gonna see it to feel like normal like any fancy can you can have the PP where after Huachuca because I'll come after yours and I recognized is just some machine driving one please see you next please nobody said watching you all that is in your mind I don't know why I said another night that's happened somebody you see satisfaction after combustion if you not happy inside be in trouble if externality gonna make you happy I want that cake I want to blow candles after they blowed you one more key my cake a couple o makki QE the pain we already painted blue painted biggest in unsatisfied instead of self-incurred green things you there's a thirst in you that you are trying to satisfy with things and you a get it yet that a man life is doesn't consist of the things of people says that Christ's have to become your life oh let's continue glory to God God sends a guide I mean we must remember him jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I pray the Father he will send you another comforter and this comforter when he was to come was the guidance to all truth isn't that right and the Word of God is the truth on the word is Christ I am the way the truth and the life he is the word I need the beginning was the word the Word of God and the Word was God and the Word made flesh and dwelt among us then if we follow the real

the Holy Spirit we ready something classic always speaks the word I've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it that's the reason the common of the seals at the finishing these are important question I can explain this and stretch it that long more be and watered on you know this is this is a very compact concise and precise just as it is I got a chance this no just after here to receive it that's the reason the common of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who what is what is how he else his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up here which is by the pyramid here all the way up here which is right up the pyramid by that time so by that time you're supposed to be in Burnet Aquinas you know what I said nothing check people come to church they're not coming to God when a chimeric what is different the view of church becomes different in a comment that is Church the coming into his presence [Music] so therefore the top part got put birthday kindness he got put some my enemy in between but this is how God is read feeding the orange feed into yellow up into green and to blue in the indigo in the violet that's holy faith unlike what if it burned it comes you put in this age it's narrows so you get a lot of people at the bottom see a lot of Jesus in Jesus name present isn't brought bottom there well as you go up you'll notice it's unknown you get caught you get home shape that brotherly kindness you have to put yourself in your brother's place on the matter that brotherly kindness is you not sitting down criticizing because you think you could do a better job that is you really and extend yourself with compassion and empathy compassion on what empathy and pretend when you feel for somebody [Music] like well but of India a son died and I went on the end which was a missile unusual I'd already stiff of the grief side and so on like was their right shoe and about your city supports you this is not like you I said notice not nickname but I feel like is my son John Allen Andrew so that's how I interpreted I feel like it's my son and what will I do if is my son so this is butter brown and I I want to be like that but when he was in India he man came up brain and they might have my shoes honey first thing but about him did was to check to see if his shoes could fit the man you see the man already blind no cord and he might have no shoes I mean they're finding that a lot people come to service to have my shoes you see people sign up on the platform with motion sickness specials but but when whatever I'm finished man was healed God restore his eyesight he said you have to feel for the person and regardless of what somebody do you if you pray for them you cannot you cannot be against them you it takes away you can't you can't bless people and prayer the evil towards them obviously with somebody and you talking to them your vaccean thing in your oh you know all your bitterness you could smell it just all inside of you you begin to pray for that post in castle you can't pretend this young and life is so strange how people want to feel vindicated and wanna feel that they are right and the man is wrong and your one gotta eat them in one got out the light and I mean more you say oh they like Lord is model I shine brighter no you you get more s no you see and you do understand when you curse because this world back on you because you could sit here and somebody blessing you and we bless em fall back on them and decrease fall back on you so it's a cousin and bless so your blessing fall back on you this bless them that hate you bless them that do evil to you press them that you feel do battle you you'll bless them and you move on with your life so it keep your spirit clear it's keep your heart clean and it'll give you the freedom to believe God for them you know we have all kind of issues but God put Berlocq atmosphere that you can enter in the spirit of forgiveness not just I forgive you and you have a knife in your back no not that kind of forgiveness they talk the spirit of forgiveness it means your drop it it means I can hug that person it means you could help that person it means you can encourage that person it mean you could strengthen that person it means doesn't matter what happened in the past your chocolate you let it go you don't want to be like spider-man you're tied to this one you tie to that one your title I wanna grab my aunt every time every person ever ultimate is tied to them they still connected to you because of anything hee-hee-hee I mean more you hardly more whether you have if it's not a forgive tinnitus clicks you got a naughty web now no you're going free no yeah I find myself forgiving people the other night just as the people faking this one I never did that before like I know we're not just in the Miss spirit I do some cutting myself kicks even people out there hallelujah my god but this is real this is very real Oh glory to God so he said you're supposed to be way up there that time where where where we till in brotherly kindness for the love of God to connect with it we always say spirit not comment on drive somebody stone dead you know if i anointed there's no noise you coming on that that whiny a prune they were praising and blessing God so they're praising and worshipping create an atmosphere that the Holy Spirit could come down on top by that and chop them on top by that so you got Konya dead and you pretty good a football cricket match this ain't no so goal six he old I don't want to Salam by the person long time will follow all Steve even could we do it oh oh boy like I guess you could but I mean we are you talking about your sonís spirit of it like this swear to God are you a better batsman you should not do it so you shall do it so also I say watching football somebody kicking the house keeping somebody in the house collect one day one is going to go to what happened then the spirit of it the atmosphere of it therefore if you want to be healed if they want to be sealed if you want help you get in the spirit of it oh god I'm not gonna bless me I come for help tonight I come out and need I looking for it you are looking for a touch from belem authorial coordinate that atmosphere got it right in and do something for you if you come I saw no blind but he must know why I say these things tonight I ain't come yesterday blind but he must hardly anybody passing he kind of coins they said Jesus in next week when they see that is no he said they carry when people say he can hear know yet the carry on my cord it knowing you forget that God is nothing doing you don't want to hear your cry now when I say men are not to sell is written on God wanting hear from you you can't touch him because Tex Tex have no feelings all these modern people if this is rusty that's what kind of text friends and what the but no feeling friends by texting text and talk and talking you the only people of X or get if this is why you ate an Evo why you sent me that for you do nobody poses any on your back you certain things and they send things back now what you don't know God not on that no son of David have mercy upon me that man said a cry out for healing fire subroutine so much that it it went to heaven heaven touch Jesus Jesus turn around and come to the man to ask him what you want to do for me what do you want me to do for you the man bang but he's still asking what do you want me to do for you and I was I want to get from your mouth I want to be healed I want to break through I want deliverance I want to touch yes I want I want you to do something special in my home and my house in my life I want it you want to hear from your mouth not have your mouth closed on your mm-hmm so you supposed to be all a week they bring us into the full stature of the sons and daughters of God that's the reason of the common of the seals first Corinthians 2:10 says but God had revealed them unto us by his Spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God no we are received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for their foolishness of the him if I can he know them because they are spiritually discerned Oh glory to God hallelujah breathe cardamon so the Spirit of Truth was to lead us to the book which is the book the Lamb's Book of redemption it's not right so the mystery that was hit you all the ages is what where Granum kept they got up that we can have the full truth just like Jesus or matter well the our common know is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth so the tree was lost to the ages so we're not to restore this troops that we can come back with the spirit now because directly worship God no not what the worship there no not who they worship they know not why the worship what we know Oh glory to God because the church have been unfolded by the opening of the seven seals we believe that hallelujah hallelujah so only after prophet come and going across and the spirit of truth behind the truth that but revealed the spirit come to Titus all glory that got to that perfection oh my Holly Lou I don't want to keep it long but I have some stuff to finish praise God and this is from the Philadelphia Church each brother said I want to just give the highlights this is the record that God had given us eternal life this life is in his son he'll have the Sun at life not a Sun Hat not like man is made holy by the spirit it is the spirit of who I like that legalism you are made holy by the Spirit it is a spirit of holiness that raised Jesus on the dead that indwells us and makes us holy with His Holiness yeah he stands the Holy One and we will stand with him glory in his righteousness holy with His Holiness I like that holy with his holiness Oh glory to God on his age the sixties the eyes of God time is joined to a close soon the cry will go forth as he comes he is filthy let him be filthy still it is right just let any righteous still he is holy let him be holy still I'm so glad that my wholeness is not myself not of myself I am glad and I am in Christ not all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed imparted unto me blessed be God forever these things said he that is true this is where we go wrong this world true is not of a very wonderful world it does that mean true in the sense of it's the opposite of false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with the passion realization I just love this just have me it's not true as opposed to false true as opposed to the unfolding truth of perfect realization and that they send John 14:21 no that's very common little perfect realization when you know that you know he said this man in in Corinthians you shall know as you unknown Oh glory to God because God know you are certainly well glory to God your friends talking about your mother your father but eyes are you that says the flesh fatter you but you are known a certain way and the promises you shall know as you unknown but before the foundation of the world Oh glory to God that's why I call you because you are before noon you are therefore you can be perfected because [Applause] it means you put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life not tonight but before the foundation of the world that gives you an opportunity to be a real gene of God Germa of God child of God Oh glory to God justified hallelujah whoa we don't go to man I burn around give a reference here watch since this would indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea idea idea of partial realization no you can understand as never before the antitype contrasted with a tight take for example all the manna from heaven court said no angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate for hungry the next day if it was left or wrong it was become contaminated but Jesus is the true bread which manna was a type and if any Mattie's of that better come from heaven he will never hunger again so when the mighty angel came on seven thunders water voices oh it was the bread come back again it was a living bread then Thomas living bread together the bride together - what about how to repair that gift that my back the Lord Himself come to call a bride or give the Lord a shout voices a call Abreu hallelujah you know God if any man eat of that bread I come from heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to compassionate again this moment he partook eternalized here indeed was reality no need of a shadow no need of passion salvation never is the whole of it Oh glory to God hallelujah as the pillar of fire give light at night and was wonderful no light and life or manifested in the fullness of the Godhead bodily is allowed I think I read her first kid that I wanted to watch carefully now and see something really sweet and beautiful I said this this is the end time revelation of himself when the day of grace closes then the millennium comes very shortly thereafter doesn't it well read remember Isaiah 66 I'm calling 65 16 to 19 then he who blesses himself any good shall bless himself in the God of truth and he that swear in the earth shall swear by the God of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they hid for mine eyes for behold I create new heavens new earth and the former shall not be remembered no come into mind but be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create your ulama betrays him and her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more not a voice of crying he said this is about the New Jerusalem this is about the millennium and as we as go into the Millennium hear what he says about being a certain kind of a God and he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth yes that is true but the real translation is not gonna shoot it is the god of the amen so we read it shall bless themselves in the core of the amen he has swear it and the earth shall swear by the god of the amen because the former troubles are forgotten and because they hid from my eyes for behold I create new heavens new earth and the former shall not be remembered but you're coming to mind but be glad and rejoice forever in what I create for behold I created who's a lot my rejoicing our people our great joy Oh glory to God and there shall be no more weeping not a voice of crying hallelujah he said yes he hoover of your Testament the core of the Amen never is Jesus of the New Testament the core of the amen Oh Israel the Lord thy God is one God hallelujah Jehovah of the old is Jesus the new I'm not of God Oh hallelujah the new testament does not reveal another God it's the full revelation of the one unseen God Christ did not come to make himself known he came he did not come to reveal the Sun he came to reveal and make known the father he never talked about two gods he talked about one God I know in this age we have come back to the capstone revelation hallelujah the most important revelation of Godhead in the whole Bible Jesus is God he and the father are one there is one God his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he is the god of the amen he never changes what he does never changes he says it and it stands fast it is done forever so when caught put your name on the book he can't cancel it it's supporting the blood section of the book rejoice tonight give God praise tonight he didn't come up on any piano please let me hit this trust hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah dan barber unquote the scripture these things saith the Amen it's not like that it means that whatever he said is final it means that whatever he said to the fullest age to the second to all the ages of his true church of what a fourth right is exactly right it won't change it means what he started open Genesis he will finish in Revelation he paths to for he is the Amen it means show be it now we can see again why the devil hates the book of Genesis and revelation he hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail he knows what his n will be how he fights that but we are on the winning side I could dance a leader Danton on tonight be on the winning side I mean believers of his world only on the 'man side all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah these things saith the faithful true witness now I want to show you what I find in the thought of faithful you know we often talk about a great unchanging God whose word does not change when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him as very impersonal it is as though God made the whole universe all the laws that pertain to it and stood back and became a great in please don't God it is a so God made a way of salvation for lost mankind at the way of the cross then when after the dead Christ atone for sins and as his resurrection there was an open door to him both full in his arms and stood back it's as if we majored in believing in the Great Creator who haven't created lost personal interest in his creation now I see that it's the whole to many a people think or after think but that's wrong thinking God is governing in the affairs of men right now the Lord shall be in the homestretch he is both creator and sustainer [Applause] so here's covenant in the affairs of men right now Alleluia he's interested in your life tonight interested in your walk tonight and chiseling your pork tonight interested in what's or only what makes you happy what makes you free what will give you joy he's interested in your joy he wants you to have joy it's his will for you to have joy - Oh hallelujah here's what the creator and the sustainer Colossians 1:16 17 for by him all things were created that I in heaven that I know visible and invisible whether they be Thrones dominions principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist he's our sovereign God by his own counsel purpose the plan of salvation of his own elect which he foreknew the son tied up on the cross they established a means of salvation and the holy spirit carefully execute the will of the Father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right now in the midst of it all he's in a mess of the church this creator and Savior God is faithfully working right now among and script these people he is the shepherd of the sheep and that's why I say tonight the spirit of truth is here the guide to lead us into perfection you say with him we rejoice we haven't seen them but we can't steal them we know him as much as our limited senses can let us but one day it will be face to face for that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age parcel realization will be made perfect realization complete realization is a hallelujah we have been looking through a glass darkly but sooner will be face to face we have seen we have been going from glory to glory but we'll be right in the glory and in his glory we shall shine we shall be like him wondrously like him she's the receiver divine Oh glory to God be accomplished in him he will not lie to us about that but one day we will be changing the atoms we will put on immortality we swallow up in life then we will realize realization Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God amen hallelujah truth to bring us our perfect realization not Paschal truth that is inherently genuine entirely without falsehood absolutely pure and timeless eternal sincere heartfelt without dissimulation without guy here because it's a spirit of truth you shall know the truth and the chicken to free you Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God God was this great spirit we pictured him of a seven color rainbow the Buddha would actually cover the earth but now as God is eternal he was perfect perfect love perfect peace will fake joy all those seven spirits as we have in Revelations he said made-up God what's perfection everything else I'm sorry that has these something else put with it from that so he's saying that seven spirits make up God and that is perfection no the only way that we can come back to perfection is to come back to that perfection which is called hallelujah what's the prophetic talk about doing bow like no letter now you're caught that is or glory no goddamn become to perfection and we have eternal life without end we don't anything is just for eternal life now I believe that there's a church comminuted a perfection that the Ministry of perfection really offices where the Apostles on the prophets and the teachers in the passage in Francis for the perfection of the church then passes on teachers will be sure with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the common of the Lord we are nearing that time Oh glory that God lost for money lots of big things lots of popularity these things our debt to the deliverer we don't care a tent or cottage why should I care live or die cinco drunk this is the thing I'm interested in the kingdom of God whether I maintain my home where I maintain my family where I maintain whatever it is let me maintain Christ the hope of glory then he said bill me up Oh Lord into this let Christ be my head not some man in England or America or Europe or South America or Africa as my head he's left Christ be my head nobody on top idea but Christ he's the capstone all alone Oh headquarters my distance will no headquarters not New York no headquarters the capstone head that cries me my head that working through me on my foundation my feet that's in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness working me Oh Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die Cinco drum denomination or nor denomination friend or no friend let that work in me let Christ virtue this knowledge flow out that I might be able to teach those he talking about virtue fluey now for God has set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists not tips he said this initiative you don't need apostles prophet to play on a tape to play back what about Tiffany church you don't need that this is the front you have except this he have to set that not man serious pastor man say that prophet or man say he said try Tom's very flimsy it's a bring of different company enjoy come bring away by bringing a come we have the word here the tribe experience the claim whatever they claim bring it and come don't claim it at a distance bring it and company forward quite as I said this what for for the perfecting and bring in all these virtues into it for that perfection of the coming of the Son of God or glory no each one of the virtues belonging to him and the app yeah got a point inside of them or glory to God hallelujah I'm gonna close well Rama said notice leads a stranger never seen in my life is a young woman much younger than me I've never seen her she said for purpose we believe these things I've taught in the Bible lady to be the truth you will lead a legend do you accept it not because I said it because God said do you believe we are living in last days when the son of man was to be manifested then this is deep that would be that would be all the word that is kind of to luta Wesley Baptist all of that and a Pentecostal all gathered up to the revelation of what it's been the seven angel was to open 16 mystery it's all gathered up into the Son of Man this fullness of time has come to the fullness of his word to manifest the fullness of the body that's the word then the spoken word may manifest by the would reveal the word so you say all that was scattered Malachi 4 William Branham got only review 6 yields it's all gathered up in the son of man who the Son of Man Jesus Christ he is the seventh seal so that's why he could keep silent and just wait until the unveiling of the mighty God or glory the core because Cora to unveil himself well that same God had unveil himself to that prophet has to feel himself in a pride for glory that God do you hear what I'm saying he's a leader in humans because in flesh 16 elements continue to fail themselves in you that's why I said adopted you know let me say that you know that
