The humble shall hear thereof and be glad." Oh, magnify the Lord with me. And let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all of my fears.

God bless you. Appreciate Jason. [Music] You know as brother Isaac said that when somebody have their storm they could talk about that storm. When you have your storm is what you're going to say is what you're going to do is what going to act. And I tell my wife I said there has to be a reason why Jesus would watch them in a storm and say be a good child. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? you are doing opposite to what the devil want you to do. &gt;&gt; Disaster, stress, uh uh all kind of things that going off key. It's supposed to make you weak, supposed to make you bowed, supposed to make you cower and and so on like that. And here it is. Jesus said, "Be a good chair. &gt;&gt; It is high. Be not afraid." What that shows is a demonstration of faith that you believe he could work this thing out &gt;&gt; in the midst of the storm &gt;&gt; in the midst of the trial. &gt;&gt; In the midst of your mind backwards, in the midst of what you're going through right now, he could work things out for his honor and his glory. Sometime we don't know. We don't know how we're going to work out, but we trust him. Hallelujah. He we we trust him that he going to make a way. Hallelujah. He going to provide. He going to open up doors. That's what we are here for to see him make that way. Oh, God bless you. So this morning we have uh but Anthony will speak up be speaking the word for us this morning. Appreciate him. Praise God. And I want to just read back this for for you. Amen. From what we read in prayer meeting, this one verse uh uh from Exodus 4 rather. It says, "And Moses took his wife and sons and set upon us and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. And the Lord said unto Moses, "When thou goest to return unto Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand, and I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go." And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, thus sayeth the Lord, Israel is my son. So God is telling Moses specific words &gt;&gt; to say to Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; He's putting Israel in context. &gt;&gt; He said, "Israel is my son, even my firstborn, and I say unto thee, let my son go, &gt;&gt; that he may serve me." &gt;&gt; And if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. &gt;&gt; So that is where every firstborn in Eve shall die. &gt;&gt; That don't come under the blood. The blood was the requirement &gt;&gt; to be safe and to secure. &gt;&gt; So God make it known in no uncertain terms &gt;&gt; that Israel is my son. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know this morning, you are his son. &gt;&gt; You are his daughter. &gt;&gt; And God want you to be let go. &gt;&gt; God want you free. &gt;&gt; God want you delivered. &gt;&gt; God want you delivered and free to serve him. &gt;&gt; Not to be a better how how do you say it now? A better you and a better me and a better version of yourself. of what kind of foolishness not that &gt;&gt; the call out of Egypt is that he might serve me. &gt;&gt; So in other words in Egypt you can't really correctly serve God as you ought to &gt;&gt; in bondage you can't serve God as you ought to. So God want you out of bondage. &gt;&gt; God want you out of Egypt. God out out of what you're in. Isn't that something this morning? Isn't that right? But Abraham said here he says now Pharaoh double italia bricks because he put pressure on them. He was completely Moses was completed in the hands of God. But the people wasn't delivered because they were still murmuring. And one night when God ordained the lamb would be killed, a type of Christ, the blood was dipped in his weeds, common weeds. And Israel became completely delivered with not a hope left behind. All that belonged to them was delivered. Now you see how I'm reading this. You have to see yourself. You have to see your family. You have to see all that belong to you delivered. You have to ride with the word. You have to ride with what God's saying to you because God is speaking to you by the word. So he said their families, their loved ones, everything was delivered when they completely come under the blood. Then he said this, that's when the church shall be completely delivered. When everything comes under the blood, when your sins come under the blood, when you're smoking, when you're gambling, when you're cheating, when you're stealing, when you're lying, when everything is brought under the blood, there'll be a total deliverance. If you have wronged somebody, make it right. You can't bring that under the blood. It won't stay. You can't bring it. Something won't let you do it. And when yourself is completely, totally brought under the blood, there'll be a total deliverance. There will be a freedom like you never known before. When everything is brought under the blood, brought in submissive to the kingdom of God, then there's real deliverance. So, we have a choice just like Adam had, just like Eve had. We have a choice to do right, to do wrong. To take of the tree of life or the tree of evil and and good and knowledge of good and evil. And if you notice everything man has is is have a good part and a bad part. The tablets the this that anything might make it have good part and bad part because it's a knowledge of good and evil and manlong with that. But we are called to a higher kingdom. We are called to a higher order. This is not the only world. You could live your life a normal life, ordinary life with nothing, no care in this world. But there's a program of God that is on his way that no man could stop. Oh, praise God. There's a deliverance coming that no man can stop. You have to want that deliverance. You have to want that breakthrough. You have to want that victory. You have to want it. You have to desire it. If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. He say, "If any man want to drink, he if any man thirst, he want you to be hungering for God, thirsting for God." That's why you come here for this this morning. You're coming for a breakthrough. You're coming for a reality. You're coming for something to speak to you. God could use anyone. Give the Lord some praises. God could use anything. God could use a song. God could use a poem. Is the Lord a shout. God could use a preacher. God could use anybody to bless you this morning. Oh, give the Lord some praise. Let's all stand and give God a shout in the house. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Where he leads me I would follow. Hallelujah. Where he leads me I would follow my Lord. My Lord where he leads me. I could follow. [Music] I'll go with him. With him all the way. God bless his brother until he comes. Where he leads me when Thank you. will follow. [Music] Oh hallelujah. Where he leads me, I will follow. Where he leads me. Oh. [Music] I'll go with with him all the way. [Music] I'll go with him. I'll go with him through the judgment. Oh, I'll go with him through the judgments. [Music] Oh, I'll go with him through the judgment. Oh, I'll go with him. With him. Oh, one more time. Where he leads me, I'll pop. Oh, where he leads me, I will follow. Who he leads me, I will follow. way leadings we are will follow. I'll go with him with him all the way. Let us praise him this morning. for his goodness and his mercy. Oh, for his faithfulness and for his love. Oh, we thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, may he lead us and guide us this morning. Oh, we don't know the way. He knows the way. He is the way this morning and we put our trust in him. How many appreciate the Lord today? How many truly thank God to be in his presence where there's fullness of joy where we can receive from the Lord faith for our hearts and to live in a time like this. How many appreciate our pastor brother Oid. Amen. Praise God. We thank you.

So God bless you and um certainly want to take too much time um but I certainly greet you in the precious name of Jesus Christ and uh we're looking forward for a great time in the Lord this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have your Bibles, thank you so much musicians and uh thank you so much uh brother Jason. Amen. for the song service this morning. Uh, amen. Praise God. [Applause] Uh, he's one of my mentors, you know. Amen. When I was young in the song leading and, um, he gave me courage to to, you know, to step into that ministry. Amen. So, I certainly appreciate him a lot. Amen. And, uh, praise God. We just thank God for all of the saints this morning. Amen. Just one second here. All right. All right. Praise. Praise God. Okay. So, sorry about that. St. Mark chapter 4, we want to read from in the New Testament. St. Mark chapter 4 and we want to read from verse 35 for scripture reading this morning. Amen. reading from the book of Mark chapter 5 and Mark chapter 5 and verse 35. Yeah. Yeah. Mark chapter 5 and verse 35. And it says, "While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, thy daughter is dead. Why troublestest thou me? Uh, sorry, why troublest thou the master any further? Just talking about Gyrus, right? So Jesus is on his way to heal Gyrus's daughter. And they receive some terrible news uh from one of his servants, saying, "Thy daughter is dead. Why troublest thou the master any further?" And as soon as Jesus heard uh the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, "Be not afraid, only believe." And he suffered no man to follow him from that point, save Peter and James, and John the brother of James. And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that weep, and wailed greatly. And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep, the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. &gt;&gt; And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and enterth in where the damsel was lying. And he took the damsel by the hand, and sth unto her, Talithumi, which is being interpreted, damsel, I say unto thee, arise. And straight away the damsel arose, and walked. for she was of the age of 12 years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. And he charged them straightly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eat. And God add blessing to the reading of his word. Let us bow our hands. Almighty God, we are grateful to you this morning for all things. Lord, you give us life and life eternally. Dear God, we are thankful to you this morning for all that you've done for us, Lord Jesus. And Lord, now we come into this house of praise and worship and the word and correction. Father, we pray that you would speak to our hearts this morning. Take me out of the way, Lord. Lord, this thought that you have put upon my heart to share with your people. I pray that you would come and breathe life into your own word this morning, dear God. For no one else can touch us like you can. No one else can speak to our hearts like you can and make the word real this morning as a living fire, Lord. Lord, that we could be inspired to move toward the direction of your grace, Lord. Grant it, almighty God, we pray your presence come down in a special way this morning as we preach and as we talk about you, Lord. Father, may you draw near to us and help us and minister to us along the way as we need as we draw strength from you this morning, Lord, for the journey that lays ahead for us. Granted, almighty God, bless the word now. Bless this portion of the service. May you bless your people mightily in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning &gt;&gt; where there's praise, honor, and glory. Amen. And we'd like to take a title for this morning's message. She is not dead. She is only sleeping. &gt;&gt; That's the title I have this morning. &gt;&gt; She is not dead. She is only sleeping. &gt;&gt; There's a particular story that inspired me recently. I was listening to a lecturer or educator by the name of Sir Ken Robinson and he shared a little thought that I thought was quite interesting and he was talking about something called Death Valley. Death Valley's hidden bloom. Uh and he was talking about Death Valley. It's actually a place a real place. It's a desert valley in a place called California and Nevada in the desert. and it is known for its extreme temperatures and low elevation. It's part of what they call the Death Valley National Park. It's the largest national park in the cont uh contiguous United States and it holds the record for the lowest hottest and driest conditions in North America. It is the driest place in North America. It doesn't get more dry than Death Valley. Nothing grows there. If you want to plant peas, if you want to plant chive, if you want to plant tomatoes, you don't go to Death Valley cuz it will die. &gt;&gt; It's Death Valley. &gt;&gt; Nothing grows there. There's no encouragement there. Nothing grows there because it doesn't rain, hence the name Death Valley. But apparently in the winter of 2004 it rained. A phenomenon actually happened where it actually rained after years of this never being an occurrence. Right? It rained 7 ines of rain in Death Valley in the winter of that year. And in the spring of 2005, the following year, a remarkable thing happened. The floor of Death Valley was actually covered in flowers. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It only lasted for a little while. But what it proved was that dead death valley is not dead. &gt;&gt; It's just laying dormant. &gt;&gt; It's just laying in a state of slumber. &gt;&gt; It's just laying in a state of sleep, &gt;&gt; in a state of rest. and laying below the surface of the earth were seeds of possibilities, &gt;&gt; waiting for the right conditions &gt;&gt; to come about. &gt;&gt; And once the right conditions were met, &gt;&gt; it had to bring forth life. And a desert that was once dead &gt;&gt; with no signs of life, &gt;&gt; home to snakes and rattlesnakes and cactus, came to life and brought forth flowers. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And it just goes to show that dead is not dead. &gt;&gt; It's only sleeping. And it doesn't matter how dead you feel this morning &gt;&gt; or what is troubling your mind or what you've been going through seemingly for a long time. &gt;&gt; Maybe those conditions are dry this morning. Maybe you don't feel anything. But I'm here to tell you this morning that that that that there is a promise that there is a possibility that maybe you can't see with your natural eyes. But laying below the surface of what you can feel this morning is something that is more real than what you can see with your eyes. Laying below the surface this morning are seeds of possibility. Seeds of deliverance, seeds of restoration, seeds of power, seeds of hallelujah, of the Holy Ghost, of dynamics, of you being healed, of you being delivered, of you being restored, of you being baptized. There are seeds this morning. That seed was always there just waiting for the right conditions, waiting for the right environment. And this morning we are in the right atmosphere. This morning we are in the right environment for those seeds that God puts in your soul to come forth with new life this morning. God is ready. After years of dormcancy, after years of sleep, after years of slumber, after years of silence, I believe in 2025, God is getting ready to pour life into those seeds this morning. Those seeds are in your heart. Seeds that you've been praying about, that nobody knows about. Those seeds are in there. And the devil try to make you feel dry. The devil try to make you feel weary. The devil try to make you feel like it would never happen for you. But I'm here to tell you tonight that the devil is a liar. God is here this morning and he's here to bring you to life. Every seed is going to bring forth after its kind. &gt;&gt; Can I get amen? [Applause] Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Doesn't matter the situation. Doesn't matter the circumstance. Doesn't matter how dead you feel, how dead your prayer life feels, how dead your family feels, how dead your atmosphere feels, your home, it feels like there's no hope. It feels like the devil's got it all. But I'm here to tell you tonight that there is a man in here who could turn on the lights. Oh, and he's turning on the light this morning that you could see a possibility &gt;&gt; with your spiritual eyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is a possibility this morning &gt;&gt; for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; There is a possibility this morning &gt;&gt; for your wife, for your husband, for your son, your daughter, your your family situation, your finances, your business, your career. Don't matter what it is, there is a possibility this morning because there's a hope that exists outside of what you can see right now. that is more real than this one. &gt;&gt; There's a world a whole world happening outside of your world &gt;&gt; that is more real than this one &gt;&gt; that is influencing this world right now &gt;&gt; doesn't just because you can't see it &gt;&gt; doesn't mean it's not there. God sent us a prophet &gt;&gt; in the end time to give us evidence &gt;&gt; of this Holy Ghost land of promises of this supernatural land that we are to possess &gt;&gt; of healing the sick of raising the dead of casting out devils. His whole life was representation of that new land that we are going to possess. That one day we are going to live in that atmosphere every single day. Until healing becomes normal. Until miracles become normal. Until missing limbs being restored become normal. Until we speak organs into existence, hands begin to grow back house. People begin to release. Hallelujah. from prison and from supernatural chains because we were meant to live in that land &gt;&gt; all the time &gt;&gt; because that is where you come from. &gt;&gt; You come from that landlord. &gt;&gt; Oh, and the devil has you only hold you bondage &gt;&gt; in Egypt. But but we're coming out of there &gt;&gt; back to our land of possession, &gt;&gt; back to our position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Because no one can take you out of your position. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Do you believe it this morning? &gt;&gt; So wherever Jesus goes, there is possibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever he goes. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what the circumstance he meets. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's possibility this morning. &gt;&gt; When they first told him, when Gyrus first came up to him and said, "My daughter is gravely ill." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh she's near death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The first report was that she was near death. &gt;&gt; She wasn't dead yet at that moment. &gt;&gt; I don't know what happened between then and the next report, but it moved from bad to worse. &gt;&gt; She moved from near death to death itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And even that didn't stop Jesus. &gt;&gt; When Gyrus first came to him and said, "Lord, I have a grave issue." He said, "Let's go." All right. &gt;&gt; He grabbed Gyrus and all his disciples and they were going down &gt;&gt; to Gyrus's house &gt;&gt; to heal, to do something, to speak something. &gt;&gt; And I don't believe this morning &gt;&gt; that Jesus is a time waster. &gt;&gt; He doesn't waste time. &gt;&gt; So if he headed down there, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; at the first report, &gt;&gt; he already knew &gt;&gt; that he could do something about it. And if the second report didn't hinder him, &gt;&gt; then we got to know that something is about to happen &gt;&gt; because Jesus is on his way. &gt;&gt; Oh, and when Jesus is on his way, can't the devil stop you? Something's got to happen, brother Popwell, because he's on his way. And this morning, he is on his way. He is already here this morning. The Lord himself has descended from heaven with a shout. He is on the earth right now. He wouldn't be here if there wasn't a possibility for you this morning and for your situation. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that right? He wouldn't give it the time of day if he didn't know he could do something about it. &gt;&gt; But he knew he could do something. So he confidently walked &gt;&gt; and the disciples followed him and Gyrus followed him and many other people although also thronged Jesus and is in this scenario is where we find the woman with the blood issue because while Jesus was on his way to perform a miracle there was a certain woman who had an issue of blood who had something she needed and she decided she needed to interrupt the program just before Sunday pray for Gyrus's daughter. She not a need and she was willing to interrupt the program because she told yourself something. Oh, you got to talk to yourself. What are you telling yourself this morning? As a man thinkketh in his heart, so he is. If you tell yourself you can't make it, then you'll never make it. But if you tell yourself, I am a son. I am a daughter of God from before the foundation of the world. And I was predestinated to be healed, to be delivered, to be restored. If you tell yourself that this morning, then there's not enough devils in this universe that can stop you from receiving the Holy Ghost, from being healed, from being delivered, from being restored. They can't stop you. because you've got faith. &gt;&gt; To bore hole, pass through all of that doubt &gt;&gt; and get to Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; You've already got what it takes &gt;&gt; when you conquered in your heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That woman of the blood is, you conquered everything in her heart already. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before she even approached that line. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And in the midst of that press, while everybody was grabbing at the top, &gt;&gt; she decided to do something different. She decided to crawl. She went where they least expected it. She went down on the dirt, down in the floor. She took her chances down there because everybody was trying to grab him up here and touch Jesus and want to be part of Jesus and want to take pictures with Jesus. She didn't come to take pictures. She didn't come to have a conversation. She didn't come to shake hands. She didn't come to join a church. She had a need that was greater than that. Do you have a need this morning? Are you ready to interrupt the program? To interrupt the flow of things? Is your need greater this morning? Greater than your mind battle, greater than your struggle, greater than what the devil throw in your direction. Is your need to find Jesus this morning? Oh, if you seek for him, you shall find him. When you seek for him with all of your heart, &gt;&gt; she touches Jesus. and she gets what she asked for, what she's praying for, &gt;&gt; what the doctors couldn't provide. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What modern medicine could not provide for her at that time. &gt;&gt; At that critical hour of her life, &gt;&gt; she got what she came for &gt;&gt; from Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday. He's the same today. He's the same forever. Don't care how much modern medicine that they have nowadays. It cannot replace the healing touch of Jesus. If you need a healing touch, he is here to heal every sickness, heal every disease, heal every frustration in your mind, every worry, every burden in your mind. He's here to heal it this morning. He's here to bring deliverance to the captive. He's here to bring peace in your troubled soul. He's here to bring rest to your weary soul. He's here to do something for you that no one else can. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Oh, hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever Jesus goes, there is possibility &gt;&gt; because in him is life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in him is light. &gt;&gt; And this light is the light of the world. &gt;&gt; It is the light of men. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; In him there is no darkness at all. &gt;&gt; It doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; I'm told when you light a match and you hold it up against the wall, you will see the shadow of the matchstick. But you'll never see the shadow of the flame because a flame don't cast no shadow. And Jesus is the light. There's no darkness in him at all that you can find. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? There's only light. There's only possibility. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; The blind sees wherever he goes. The the sick is being healed. &gt;&gt; Wherever you go in scripture, the cripples are walking out of their beds. &gt;&gt; The Bible even said at a certain place that many more miracles that Jesus performed &gt;&gt; that are not recorded in the scripture, &gt;&gt; but these have been recorded. that you might believe &gt;&gt; that he is the son of God &gt;&gt; that was sent forth into all the world &gt;&gt; to die for the sins of man &gt;&gt; and to make us free. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? The grass the the cripples are walking. Isn't that right? The gospel is preaching power &gt;&gt; wherever Jesus goes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message called life in 57 the prophet said here and I find out that when he said I give unto them eternal life he said it comes from the word the Greek word Zoe z o e zoey &gt;&gt; and zoe is god's own life &gt;&gt; and then as sure as we are a partaker of zoey we exist eternally like god exists eternally &gt;&gt; therefore by being partaken of God, &gt;&gt; we actually become eternally blessed and saved forever and ever without end without beginning. We become a part of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. When we are sure as we are partakers of Zoe, then we exist eternally like God exists eternally. &gt;&gt; And therefore by partaking of God, we become eternally blessed and save forever. we become a part of God. So therefore, by partaking of God, we become a part of God. Let me say that one more time. By partaking of God, we actually become a part of God. Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right? That's why in Revelation, they keep telling John, "Come and see. Come and see." Because you've got to see this thing for yourself. You've got to partake of it and understand what's going on. It can't be somebody else's experience. It cannot be somebody else's testimony. It cannot be somebody's else's idea or someone else's report of what is happening. You need to come and see. Oh, that's why David said in the Psalms, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed is the man that trusteth in him. You've got to taste this thing for yourself. If you haven't tasted of it, then you haven't partaken of it. And if you haven't partaken of it, then you can't become a part of God. Oh, you can't talk about the Holy Ghost. You've got to have the Holy Ghost. You can't talk about salvation. You've got to have salvation. You can't talk about sanctification. You've got to have sanctification. You've got to partake. You've got to taste and see that the Lord is good. Oh, that his mercies is everlasting and that his truth endure to all generations. You've got the taste of it in the trial, brother Batist. You got the taste of it in the storm. That's the best time to taste Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. He's the sweetest thing I know. Because when the storm is around you, when there's no light that you can see with your eyes, you believe that there's a God in your heart that never failed you yet. And you could lift up your hands in the midst of your circumstance and say, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust him. I love him." I want the devil to know that I love him this morning. And there's no heights, no depths that can separate me from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus. For who he forneew, he called, and who he called, he had justified. And who he had justified, he had already glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? Oh, hallelujah. Can the devil with all his mind battles, with all his misery be against you? I say nay. Who can lay charge against God's elect? It is God that justifyth. It's God that justified you before the foundation of the world that your face will be counted for righteousness. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. stand there with the faith of Abraham in your situation and get the same victory and conquer like the early fathers conquered. &gt;&gt; Same faith it take to slay Goliath was the same faith Peter had to say rise up and walk. It's &gt;&gt; not a different faith. &gt;&gt; Same faith. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; It's faith. &gt;&gt; Pure possibility. Amen. and in God. Isn't that right? All right. &gt;&gt; Me hurry along here. &gt;&gt; So, by partaking of God, we actually become a part of God. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. So, it's so it's so you've got to know him for yourself. &gt;&gt; You've got to know him. &gt;&gt; Because to know him is life. &gt;&gt; Not just the word, &gt;&gt; but the author of the word. &gt;&gt; To know him. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? To have a relationship with him. That's what we aspire to do this morning. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And it's only when you taste it for yourself. &gt;&gt; That's when you can truly tell others about it. &gt;&gt; Because now you become a witness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A true witness &gt;&gt; of what he's done for you in your life. &gt;&gt; It's not someone else's account &gt;&gt; or someone else's story about what he's done, &gt;&gt; but you have your story that you could tell &gt;&gt; about how you overcome. And the Bible said they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony that glorifies God in their age. And right in this age of 2025, you are going to have a testimony of taste and see that what the Lord has done for me. Oh brother, come and see. Sister, come and see. Auntie, come and see. Uncle, come and see. Oh, what the Lord has done for me. He gave me joy when I had no joy. He He gave me peace when I had no peace. He gave me love. He gave me friendship. Oh, hallelujah. He gave me something &gt;&gt; more than gold &gt;&gt; in my soul. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God. Like a stream running down. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Second Peter Peter 4:1 says, "Whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That by these he might be partakers of the divine nature, &gt;&gt; having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust." &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? You become a partaker, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; of the divine nature of God &gt;&gt; when you partake of this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This life that he has revealed in the last days that we are to partake of faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, and so on. Isn't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we are we aspire to this with all diligence. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Because by partaking of this, we become a part of God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Oh my. &gt;&gt; For so entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. So dead isn't really dead. It's just laying dormant. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; We live in the realm of the natural. So therefore when we see something dead in our world &gt;&gt; in our context through our eyes &gt;&gt; as far as we are concerned it is a lost cause. &gt;&gt; It is finished at that point. &gt;&gt; When the servant came the second time with the report &gt;&gt; he was coming to tell him that why you bothering with this mission anymore. &gt;&gt; Cancel the mission. Best we abort the mission because because your daughter is dead. &gt;&gt; There's no hope for her. She she she has already gone beyond the point of no return. &gt;&gt; But with God that doesn't exist and because with God that doesn't exist, his son will do likewise because Jesus said, "I do that which the father had shown me." So if God is not moved by the death report, then Jesus is not moved by the death report because you are living in time but he is living in eternity. Oh, so when the doctor says time of death, oh, it's 11:20 a.m. God has a different story. He says time of life forever, forever, for always. There's no end of life. There is no beginning of days. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; With God, all things are possible. And &gt;&gt; if your objective of today's service today is to get to you is to see that there is a possibility &gt;&gt; that lies beyond the natural &gt;&gt; that God is able to do for you today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that that's our objective to be here this morning and I pray that God will anchor that to you today. Amen. &gt;&gt; By the word of God. &gt;&gt; So because there is no way back from that. We can't see any other possibility outside of death because we've never had an experience beyond death that that confirms to us that that that anything is possible. That's what our natural eyes tell us. But today, God is supernatural. &gt;&gt; He is not natural. &gt;&gt; He is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Anything that you could explain with science and with with this and that is called natural. But when science has reached its limit, when man has reached its limit, when we are out of explanations, then that is what we call the supernatural. Oh, natural science can do this. Modern technology can do that. But when God could bring somebody back from the dead, when God could raise up a broken life, a forgotten life, a brother or sister who gave up on themselves, a young man, young woman who said they're far gone, there's no point of return for me. When God does that for an individual, that is supernatural. [Applause] And that is what the gospel can do. &gt;&gt; That is what Jesus can do. &gt;&gt; For someone who believes, &gt;&gt; it is to him that believeth this morning. &gt;&gt; Do you believe in God this morning? &gt;&gt; Jesus told that silver, he said, "Don't be afraid. Only believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible &gt;&gt; if you only believe." &gt;&gt; Hey, just keep your eyes on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Don't look to the left. Don't look to what is being said on the right. &gt;&gt; Just keep your eyes focused on the goal &gt;&gt; cuz Jesus can get you there. &gt;&gt; Jesus alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? So today he is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. He exists. What does that mean? He's supernatural. Meaning he exists outside of the realm of possibilities. &gt;&gt; Outside of the natural and earthly realm &gt;&gt; that you can see with your eyes. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And of course. Yeah. Amen. Right? Isn't that right? So, what is laying in you has got to come to life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. There's a reason Jesus has come down the road this morning. &gt;&gt; He's come to get you &gt;&gt; because there's something special about you &gt;&gt; and you are being called to a higher place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's going to resurrect you this morning. &gt;&gt; Bring you out from the dead works of in this life and bring you onto life eternal life in Jesus Christ. Holy Spirit works. That's what he's here to bring you to this morning. And there is no devil that can stop him on his mission this morning. Uh he will get to you and uh and and return unto you according to the time of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And I was studying Genesis recently and I realized something here again and the scripture actually shows us where animal life comes from. &gt;&gt; I know we probably read this before, but I want us to read it again. we'll kind of catch what he's saying. What they're saying here in Genesis. It's no mystery that a fish can't help but swim. You know, it always says it fish swimming is built into the fish. Flying is built into the bird. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? It's built in. They can't help but do it. &gt;&gt; Look at this. The fish of the sea and the fowl of the air. When God proclaimed this creation, he said in Genesis 1:20, which 120, he said, "And God said, let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life &gt;&gt; and foul that may fly above the earth." Let me say that one more time cuz I feel you didn't you didn't get that. And God said, "Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature &gt;&gt; that had life." In other words, it was the mouth of God that spoken it, but the water, God used the water as an incubator &gt;&gt; of the word. Just like he used Mary as an incubator for the word to come forth, he used the sea as an incubator, as a womb to bring forth every moving creature, every fish, every squid, every crustation, everything that is seen, every millions of species of fish was actually come out of the sea itself. It means out of the water itself came forth every creature, &gt;&gt; every fish, every whale, every crustation. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Both great and small. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me read it here. And God created great whales and every living creature that move it, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and after every winged fowl of its kind. And God saw that it was good. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And then when you skip down, lower down now to 124, he said he talks about the beast and creeping things. Let me read it. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature &gt;&gt; and after its kind, let the earth bring forth." Oh, so the voice of God spoke on it, but the earth had a job to do. Though the voice of God spoke it, the water had a job to do. The waters had to bring forth of every fish. The earth had to bring forth of every beast of the field, every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. The earth had a job to do. And when God had created all of it, ask me a question, preacher. Where did man come from? Genesis 1:26. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish, over the fowls, over the creeping thing." Oh, man didn't come from the earth originally. He come from God. Oh, this flesh man come from the earth. But where do we come from this morning? Oh, brother Brham said, "When God created me, William Brham, I was before the foundation of the world. He made my being, he made my spirit, I wasn't conscious of it." He said, "But I was there." He said, "Oh, I don't believe you're getting it. Wait just a minute." He told his disciples, he knew them before the foundation of the world. And Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, are you getting it this morning? Oh, brother said, "There's some part of me. There's some part of Alman Neville. There's some part of the rest of you here. There's some part of you, somebody of you, my brother, some part of you, my sister, that Jesus Christ before the world ever began." Oh, and the Brother Benham said, "I think that people today are possessed with this spirit or the spirit of the part of the angelic beings. You are possessed with the spirit that rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie. You are possessed this morning with a supernatural spirit. That spirit won't let you back down. That spirit will not let you give up. That spirit woke up this morning with the Holy Ghost. That spirit woke you up this morning. You put your clothes on. You came into the house of God. Uh you said, "I'm coming for deliverance. I'm coming for healing. I'm coming for breakthrough. I'm coming to get mine." Give the Lord a shout of praise. Woo! Somebody praise him. Somebody shout. You are possessed with that spirit this morning. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Oid said it before. He said if some man is possessed with the spirit of devils. Hallelujah. 10,000 devils upon him. He'll have the strength of 10 men. He could fight and kick. Isn't that right? He's got power. Natural power. And if demons could do that to a man, what about a son? What about a daughter of God that is fully possessed by the spirit of the living God? They become omnipotent. They become unstoppable. They become undefeated because God is in you and God is with you to defeat the enemy on any ground he comes upon. Oh, because you are possessed. Oh, by this attribute son spirit that you once was in the beginning and before the beginning. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful. I feel we got that this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's great. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we can move on. Hallelujah. Glory. Give him praise. Oh yes. Rejoice ever more. Oh, rejoice, oh my soul. forget not all his benefits. He chose you. He put something in you this morning &gt;&gt; to defy the odds. &gt;&gt; No matter how the circumstance look, God put a faith in your soul &gt;&gt; to go beyond possibilities &gt;&gt; and see the impossible made possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God be praised. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you are possessed with that spirit this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something possessed me this morning &gt;&gt; to get out of my bed &gt;&gt; and to give God glory &gt;&gt; and to put on my clothes because I know something has got a hold of me. I went to a meeting one night and my heart was right and something got a hold of me. It held me in primary school. It held me in high school. It held me in college. It held me here on the streets. It held me on the job. It's still holding me. It's still keeping me. It's keeping my wife. It's keeping my family. It's keeping my finances. I am possessed with a spirit this morning that lets me praise him, that lets me worship him. And it won't let me doubt. It won't let me back down. It won't let me give up. It won't let me get. Oh, I've got to get a hold of him. &gt;&gt; He alone has the answer. Jesus alone. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Okay. Angelic beings associate together. I hope you get that. He said that just dropped right down. I said, look, if you got the Holy Spirit in you, then you are a candidate for association with the unseen world, with the supernatural. Oh, you are a candidate. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. When you get that Holy Spirit inside your soul, but the Bible said when the Holy Spirit comes into the human heart, you become a two-fold being. One on earth to die, but one in heaven to live. Oh, your body might be subject to death, but in your soul, you are passed from death unto life. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, you come from God. You go back to God. That's why God redeemed you because of seed in you had to come to life just as God redeemed the earth. Listen, there's no scripture that says, "Let there be seed." It's in Genesis 1:11. We say God said, "Let every seed bring forth after its kind." And then the Bible explained that the seed was in itself in the earth. So when God created the earth, the seed was already inside of it. And what God was just doing was preparing the earth for the seas to come forth. That's why God redeemed you. That's why God paid the price for you. That's why God died for you on Calvary. He was preparing a groundh. He had to redeem you. He redeemed the earth by water. He redeemed the earth by blood. He'll redeem the earth by fire. He'll do for you the same because there's a seed inside of you that's got to come to life. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, set me free. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's wonderful. &gt;&gt; In his body, he has earthly contact with your five senses. But in your spirit, &gt;&gt; you have contact with God through the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and the angels of God visit you, &gt;&gt; speaks with them. Isn't that right? They are messengers sent from God &gt;&gt; to reveal and to bring messages from God &gt;&gt; to the individual in you is a seed of potential &gt;&gt; ready to bring forth season, bring forth fruit in your season of life. Isn't that right? And there's coming forth another time of life &gt;&gt; real soon. &gt;&gt; We believe it to be true &gt;&gt; and that you are going to bring forth Christ. &gt;&gt; You're going to bring forth Messiah. &gt;&gt; Psalms 126 and verse 5 says, "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weep it, bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheav with him." Yes, there's a time of weeping, but it's not forever. Psalms 30 said weeping may endure for a night, but joy, joy, joy cometh in the morning. Weeping is not forever. Weeping is just in this natural realm. But there's going to come a time when Jesus himself will go around the table of the lamb and wipe every tear from the eyes. Oh, hallelujah. He's going to keep heal you from all your hurts. help you of all your troubles. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. He loves you this morning. and he's here to minister to you and encourage your heart even now. God is able to do something for us this morning that even though you're sewing tears, sewing praying, hallelujah, sewing seed, seeking, sewing seed and labor, sewing seed, oh, without a visible sign of possibility of newness of life, uh you're on the cross. You're bearing all things, believing all things, and hope in all things, knowing that charity is coming. Charity is on its way. Charity upon a perfectness. Charity, the absolute is coming to seal the virtues inside of your soul and give you a brand new touch and cap off your life. Oh, so that you go no more out. Amen. but that you become a pillar &gt;&gt; in the house of the go our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Feeling fine this morning. &gt;&gt; Sarah's womb was dead. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; As far as man knows. &gt;&gt; Sarah's womb was dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was barren. &gt;&gt; She couldn't bring forth nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And more than that, &gt;&gt; she was too old to bring forth children. &gt;&gt; So there was no possibility in this earthly realm &gt;&gt; of her ever bringing forth the promised son, Isaac. &gt;&gt; But that has nothing to do with God. Because when God called Abraham out of the tent, he said, "Look up at the stars. Count the stars. I'm waiting for you. Count if you could finish. When you're finished, tell me when you're finished." Oh, the answer is still wrong. You can't count it. He said, "So shall thy seed be." Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are going to bring forth a son. Oh hal. And that seed, oh hallelujah. Is going to be the seed of nations. Oh, and through your wife Sarah, she's going to bring forth this promised son. God didn't talk to Sarah. God talked to Abraham. Therefore, Abraham had to have faith for himself and his house, to walk and stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief. But he was strong, giving praise to God. Did Abraham have struggles? Yes, he did. Did Abraham have mind battles? Yes, he did. But the Bible doesn't record that. What the Bible says was that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God. Oh, you have struggles. You have trials. You have testings. But the seed inside your soul is testifying something back this morning. Uh that in 2025 you come up all the road. Many fell off on the left. Many fell off to the right. But you staggered not at the promise of God. Oh hallelujah. But you were strong in your faith. Uh oh. In your age, in your hour, in the most evil age that there was. God put a faith in your soul, my brother, a faith in your soul, my sister, and he is going to reward it with a glorious, wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost. That sweet Holy Spirit is going to sweep over your soul and seal you into the kingdom of God by the fire of the living God that comes into the human heart. A literal experience. that you must have &gt;&gt; in order to meet him in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Out there yonder, &gt;&gt; he's got to have something in here to recognize you up there. Representation. &gt;&gt; He promised to send down your representation by fire in your soul and confirm the faith that you have in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. In your word for your day. He's going to anoint your word for your day. &gt;&gt; He's going to anoint you to manifest Revelation 22:17. He's going to anoint you &gt;&gt; with a special anointing &gt;&gt; for the bride in the last days. &gt;&gt; And that's what we are waiting on. &gt;&gt; We're waiting for the spirit to come upon us. &gt;&gt; I remember a friend was a student Yeah. was telling me something or somebody somebody's telling me something about juvie &gt;&gt; and they were saying that they went and play Juvie &gt;&gt; and apparently there's this thing that they wait on &gt;&gt; they wait on the breaking of the day &gt;&gt; and the person described it they said there's a spirit that happens there's something that breaks upon the people &gt;&gt; just about the breaking of the day &gt;&gt; they said anybody who experienced jo that's what they're waiting for it's not so much the music it's not too much the mud mass and the this but what they waiting on is for that spirit of freedom to come upon them that lets them loose that makes them break their bands and jump and carry on and revalry and so forth. They are actually waiting on a spirit to come upon them and I said my if the people in the world are waiting on a demonic entity to come upon them to give them freedom then what are we waiting on this morning? Brother Brandham said you know what I'm waiting on. I'm waiting on the angel of God. We are those angelic spirits. We are waiting for our spirits to come upon us. The spirit of the living God to give us power to heal the sick. Give us power to raise the dead. Give us power to give to make us real Christians so that we could walk holy, walk reverence, walk in a way that God will be pleased with us that he could tap us on the shoulder and say, "My son, I speak to you by my spirit. Turn left on this street. Turn right on this street. You don't have to know all the answers. We just trust in God. Uh cuz he has a plan for your life. He knows what's going to happen real soon. &gt;&gt; And he wants to position you &gt;&gt; for his mighty working power to be wrought in your life. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Time is hurrying on. &gt;&gt; So Sarah's womb was dead, &gt;&gt; but it didn't stay dead for long. One time Abraham is out there in the desert. &gt;&gt; Three men come up the road. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's an empty desert &gt;&gt; with three men walking up the road. &gt;&gt; There are not many visitors in the desert. So if three men come walking up the road, that's got to be something special. It's got to be a special visitation. It's got to be coming for them. They were headed in their direction. And Abraham said, "Get the feast ready. Get the fire ready. Get the table ready. We are about to have a visitation. 25 years on believing, but the visitation is finally here. And my brother, my sister, you've got to be under expectation for your visitation. Angels are getting ready to visit you real soon. You better get ready this morning. Get the house cleaning this morning. Sweep the cobwebs. Sweep out the floors. Let the neighbors see the dust flying. We are getting ready for a special mighty visitation. &gt;&gt; Oh, to visit you &gt;&gt; according to your time of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aon's rod was dead. &gt;&gt; It was dead, but it wasn't dead. &gt;&gt; But your natural eyes was it was a stick for a long time. &gt;&gt; Bible actually records Aon rod was what the rod god used. Aaron lifted up his rod and miracles begin to happen. Signs and wonders begin to happen. God used the dead rod, hallelujah, to do all forms of miracles. But one time Aaron left that rod in the right place. He forgot that rod in the right place. Oh, hallelujah. In the presence of the shikina glory. Oh, overnight. What was for years dead? What was for years just a old stick that God used to defy the mighty kingdom of Egypt? What was a old dead stick? God. And in the presence of God, that stick once more came to life. Oh, it bued. It blossomed. It brought forth fruit. Oh, because it was connected to something. something you can't see with your eyes. But you know, you can feel it's a supernatural and it's a lifegiver to the word. And when God spoke every tree into existence, that stick had a genetic code inside of it. And when it was in the presence of the creator, when it was in the presence of the master, certain things uh begin to happen. And when you are in the presence of the master, certain things have got to happen. The sick are here, the blind sea, the walk. Uh you receive your portion in the presence of the master. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why it's so important to be in the presence of the master. When you at work, press to be in the presence of the master. When you on the job, when you on the street, uh that's why prayer is important. Uh it keeps the atmosphere. It keeps the anointing on you while you're driving your car. Lord, I want to be uh in the presence of the master. I want to be sitting at your feet. Uh I want to be drinking from your cup. I want to be feasting at your table, surrounded by your glory, in your presence. That's where I long to be. Uh that's where I want to be always. Help me to be immersed in the presence of God. I want to be so immersed in the presence of God that doubts do not fase me, that trials don't phase me, that circumstances don't phase me. When things don't work out, that's all right. As long as I'm in the presence of Jesus, I'll make it. I'll be okay. He's with me in the trial. He is with me in the storm. Oh, may that be your testimony as a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's what real Christianity is. &gt;&gt; In the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Come alive again. &gt;&gt; Let's talk about Ezekiel. &gt;&gt; All right. Ezekiel once was stand in a valley of dry bones. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; God had him to be there. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "The hand of the Lord was upon me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And carried me out in the spirit of the Lord &gt;&gt; and set me down in the midst of a valley which was full of bones. And he caused me to pass by a rem roundabout. And behold, there were many in the open valley. And lo, they were very dry. And he said unto me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered and said, "Oh Lord God, thou knowest?" And he said unto me, "Prophesy upon these bones and say unto them, oh ye dry bones." Oh, you got to prophesy this morning. Prophesy from the word of God, can these dry bones live? The word of God is here to answer that question this morning. that is not dead. It's only sleeping. It's only dormant. It's only waiting on a word from the Lord, on a word from the master to take what was once dead and bring it to life again. You are coming alive this morning. Lift up your hands. Give the Lord a shout of praise. Let every creeping thing, let everything that had breath, praise God. Let the new breaths of God come into you this morning. While you're worshiping, while you're praising, while you're defying the enemy, the Lord will send his ambushments and rock the enemy in your home, in your life, in your soul, in your heart, in your family. He is doing it now. Lift up your hands and claim the victory of God in the house of Almighty God. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Glory. Glory. Glory. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh ye dry bones. Hear the word of the Lord. Thus sayeth the Lord unto these bones. Speak to your bones this morning. Oh, whatever ache you got in your bones, speak to them bones this morning and say unto these bones, behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live, and I will lay senu upon you, and bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath into you, and ye shall know that I am the Lord." And Ezekiel said, "So I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied, while he had spake these words, while he was prophesying, there came a noise and behold, a shaking, and the bones came together." Oh, those bones are coming together this morning. What was scattered? What was like a puzzle? What couldn't be figured out? Those bones are coming together this morning. Bone to bone. The hip tie connected to the cheekbone and the leg bone to the kneebone and the kneebone to the footbone. And God knows where every bone is this morning. Let bone come to bone. Let every backsliden bone. Hear the voice of God this morning. Ricochet throughout the earth. The sons of God are coming back. Keep not thy sons from me. God is going to drag them from the east. Bring them from the west. Bring them from the north. Bring them from far. House of Israel. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is God doing? &gt;&gt; Getting a bride together from the east, from the west, from the north, from the south. Isn't that right? And even brother oid shared with us on the Friday night service, the prayer service. He said God scattered us throughout the earth. Why? So that he could deal with us as individuals. He want some through the waters, some through the flood, some through great mountains, some through valleys, but all through the blood, some through storms, some through trials. But we've all got to have a testimony of how we overcome. You got to have something to tell David. When he threw Goliath, what are you going to say? When Joshua overcame the Amalachites, what are you going to say? When Elijah had to fight them prophets of Bale, what are you going to say? You've got to have a testimony this morning that I made it through the darkest hour, through the most evil age. God was with me. He is my rod. He is my staff. He was my fortress. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He kept me from going crazy. He kept me from losing my mind. He kept me Oh, he kept me. God kept me from cracking my mind. He kept me uh He kept my family though they were wayward though they were straight away. He kept them. It was only God and God only. Oh, hallelujah. He's keeping you this morning. Lift up your hands and acknowledge the one who's been keeping you this morning. He's keeping your feet from falling. He's keeping your eyes from straying away from the truth. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. When I beheld and lo, the su and the flesh came upon them. The skin covered them, &gt;&gt; but there was no breath in them. So it required another prophecy. &gt;&gt; The bone came together. &gt;&gt; The s news was upon it. &gt;&gt; The skin had covered it. &gt;&gt; The job was almost complete. &gt;&gt; But it needed one more prophecy. One more prophecy. He told Ezekiel, "Prophesy again. One more time. But this time, you're going to prophesy to the wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say unto the wind, thus sayeth the Lord, come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they might live. Oh, God is doing a work in your life. He's putting bones to bone. He's putting flesh upon those bones. He's putting skin upon those bones. We are being prepared by the Lord in the presence of God. What are we being prepared for? One more prophecy. Oh, the bride hasn't had a revival yet, but she is waiting for one more prophecy to come to pass that the wind of God, the wind, the breath of God, the same Holy Ghost wind that came into the upper room that blew through the upper house uh and filled all those that were sitting. That same holy lick of fire that sat upon each of them. Not just the apostles, but all of them received a lick of fire. Mary received her lick of fire. Martha received her lick of fire. Oh, and you are going to receive every man, every woman, every husband, every father, every deacon, every elder, every minister. Oh, downstairs, upstairs, in the back, technicians, receive it, oh the Holy Ghost. Oh, oh, breath of God. Uh, breathe upon these slain that they might live. Oh, you are like Samson this morning. You see a possibility that despite your eyes, you see a possibility. Oh, breath of God, breathe one more time. Once more, Lord, pour out your Holy Spirit. Once more, Lord, pour out your anointing. Once more, Lord, do what you can do, what you promise to do in this end time, in these last days. How we need the spirit of God more than ever, &gt;&gt; more than ever before. Oh my, it's a privilege. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation &gt;&gt; to see what is needed in this hour &gt;&gt; so that we could cry out for it. &gt;&gt; When the disciples went into the upper room, they cried out. &gt;&gt; They were waiting, taring, praying, seeking, looking &gt;&gt; for a visitation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Tarry in the city." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Until you be endued. &gt;&gt; Don't tarry until you feel tired. Don't tarry until you feel defeated. Don't tarry until you feel upset or &gt;&gt; until you're hungry. Don't tired. No, no, no. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Tar until &gt;&gt; until power is come to you. &gt;&gt; Until you are endued with power from on high. &gt;&gt; Until you get a portion from heaven, &gt;&gt; stay there &gt;&gt; until you are visited with this mighty spirit &gt;&gt; that is promised to come upon you. &gt;&gt; And that's what they're waiting on. And that's what we're waiting on this morning &gt;&gt; because with what we've got, we can't hardly do it. &gt;&gt; We can't have enough faith for a tut, &gt;&gt; much less for the rapture. God help us. But God will visit us and give us power. Men who were once afraid to go out in public. They slammed the door open when they receive this Holy Ghost. And they said, "Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved?" He said re repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This gift that we have received shall come upon you also. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh and you'll do the same things we did. &gt;&gt; Signs, wonders, miracles. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit &gt;&gt; doing the same things. evidence that the same spirit is there. &gt;&gt; And that's what we're looking for this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. A continuation of that spirit. Oh my. Me hurry. A long time is going. &gt;&gt; So he prophesied as he commanded and breath came into them &gt;&gt; and they lived &gt;&gt; and stood up on their feet. &gt;&gt; An exceeding great army. &gt;&gt; Oh, God's got an exceeding great army out there. But they're waiting on the breath of God to come by a prophecy &gt;&gt; to make them live &gt;&gt; and act and move as God had for them to move. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; According to the will of God, &gt;&gt; isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. I believe we got it this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lazarus was dead. Jesus said, "I go wake him." Matter of fact, he stick along a little two days more when he heard the report that he was gravely ill. &gt;&gt; Well, isn't that right? And he waited. And some might think that was crazy. What What are you waiting on? But he was waiting on the right time. Waiting on the right season. And when the right season came, he said, "Lazarus is sleeping. But I go wake him." Oh, he is not dead as you think. He is not cut off as you suppose. Oh, hallelujah. I'm going. I've got a mission now. Oh, hallelujah. I'm going to wake up that which was dead. That which was once cut off, that which was lost. Oh, that which is seemingly lost. God is going to wake up the dead. Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right? Isn't that right? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, St. John 11 says, "These things he said after he said unto them, our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I go that I might wake him out of sleep." And then said his disciples, "Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well." &gt;&gt; They're thinking, "That's it. Let him go and rest in peace. And he said, "How be it Jesus speak of his death, but yet they thought that he had spoken of taking a rest in sleep." Oh, so I thought he was sleeping in the natural, isn't it? All right. So he said, "He do well. He's taking a rest." Then Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead." &gt;&gt; Now they understood he's dead. Praise God. And I go wake him. He said, "And I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there &gt;&gt; to the intent that he might believe. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, let us go unto him." And verse 20 says, "Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met with him, but Mary sat still in the house." This was Martha's conversation. &gt;&gt; And then Martha said unto Jesus, "Lord, if thou has been here, my brother had not died." Oh, hallelujah. What a word. Praise God. Hallelujah. She knew that if Jesus was in town, Lazarus couldn't stay in that condition because he is the healer. And once he is around, the sick cannot stay sick. Once Jesus is around, the dead cannot stay dead. Ba said, "If you had been here, he would not be dead." That's why he lingered two days more. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because there was something he wanted to perform and he still came down the road because he knew that there was a possibility. He wouldn't go somewhere unless he knew there was something he could do about it. Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right? And she said, "I know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, &gt;&gt; God will give it to thee, oh she had faith, and even now if you speak, something could change. Even now if you speak, the situation can turn around." Jesus said unto her, "Thy brother shall rise again." Martha said unto him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection and at the last day." Oh, she's plugging into the word now. But Jesus said unto her, "I am the resurrection and the life." You might be looking for a far off promise, but now faith is. Resurrection is not just tomorrow, but it is right now. Now is resurrection power. He said, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. She said, "Believe thou this?" She said, "Yeah, Lord, believeth thou this this morning?" We say, "Yes, Lord. Whoever believe in him shall not die, but they shall live." God is on a mission this morning. The dead cannot stay dead. The cannot stay crippled. The silent cannot stay silent. Oh, you got to make some noise. some Holy Ghost noise. When Jesus comes around, when Jesus is in town, he's passing by your pew. He's passing by your aisle this morning. Say, "Touch me that I'd never be the same again." Oh, touching Jesus is all that really matters this morning. Do you believe it? Give the Lord praises. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus walked down there. Everybody walking around not sure what's going to happen. But then he spoke a word unto them. Roll away the stone. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And they started to complain. They said, "But Lord, he's four days dead. Isn't he stinking? Hallelujah. Doesn't he stink it?" And Jesus answered unto them, "Don't you believe the word that I said unto you? Oh, roll away the stone. Don't you worry. Something is about to happen. But I need to get doubt out of the way. I need to get fears out of the way because what's about to happen? There can be no restrictions. God has to get everything out because his glory is getting ready to be manifested. His power is getting ready to be manifested. God is getting ready to do something. Oh, that no eye has seen that no ear has heard. Oh, nor can it produce this morning. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Life is getting ready to come forth. &gt;&gt; Because life is getting ready to come forth. Doubt and fear cannot occupy the same space. We got to have faith in this place this morning. Roll away your stone. Roll away all your ideas. Roll away all your fears. Roll away all your worries. Roll away all your mind battles. Roll away all your hindrances. It might take a great effort this morning, but I challenge you to do it. Do something about your deliverance. Do something about your breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Listen. Listen. When God is getting ready to do something, he is the God that is unlimited in his power. But he always makes a way for you to participate in your own miracle. God wants you. You don't hear me this morning. God wants you to participate in your own miracle. He wants you to participate in your own breakthrough, in your own deliverance. There's something you've got to do. Martr had to roll away the stone in order to see Lazarus come back from the dead. In order to see water turn to wine, somebody had to go and draw the water pots. Somebody had to go do the job. In order for you to see a miracle, God has you had to participate in your own miracle. If you want to see the valley full of ditches, you got to dig ditches. Oh, if you want to see them full with water, if you want to see a miracle in your life, then there's something you've got to do. You've got to pray. You've got to cry. You've got to call on God. You've got to get next to God. You've got to do the job. You've got to do the work. There's something you've got to do. You've got to get sanctified. You've got to get next to God. Throw out all the TV. Throw out all the trash. Throw out all the internet. Throw out every distraction, everything that would hinder you uh from getting your blessing, from getting your breakthrough, from getting your miracle, you've got to roll it away. Roll away. Roll away grudges. Roll away this trial, that circumstance, what this one did to you, what that one did to you. Roll it away this morning. Say, "Lord, I'm getting it out of my mind cuz I need a miracle this morning. And my need is greater than my stone. Roll away your stone. My need is greater than my stone. My need is greater. What I want from God &gt;&gt; is more important than the stone that is in front of me. and I won't let it hinder me &gt;&gt; from what God is about to do &gt;&gt; in my life. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Believeth thou this. &gt;&gt; So Gyrus daughter coming back around to this. Getting ready to rounds up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Do you love him today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And while he yet speak He was just b busy ministering to the woman who touched him who had the blood issue. That's right. She was just finished ministering to her and saying, "Go in way. Go in peace. Thy fate has made thee whole. Go in peace and behold of thy plague." While he was yet saying this, a second report come. Why trouble is the master? But he told him, "Don't be afraid. Only believe." And from that point on, he took three men with him. Peter, James, and John. And he said, "Come with me." That's not the first time he took those three men with him. Praise God. Isn't that right? Praise God. But he took these men with him. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? Because they had faith to see what was about to happen next. &gt;&gt; He needed faith atmosphere to be in &gt;&gt; because something was about to break forth. &gt;&gt; And when he come down to the scene, he we meet awake. Things are moving very quickly. They have already stopped the clocks in the house. They've already throw the sheet over the girl. They've already beun to prepare the biscuits and to prepare the the they begun to send out RSVPs and notes letting everybody know that our daughter is dead and there's no more hope. The Bible said he came and found a tumult a tumultuous situation. Uh people are weeping in a corner. Someone is is grieving in a corner. Someone is washing up the sick bay and the sick bed and the cloths because there's no more hope now. And this is the hopeless condition &gt;&gt; that Jesus comes down to meet down in Gyrus's house. &gt;&gt; He come down there to meet awake. He heard that she was in the edge of death. Now she's at death. It's beyond that point now. Hallelujah. It took him a while to get there, but Jesus always gets there. And he gets there on time. It might seem as if he's late, but don't you worry. He is right on time. He is right on schedule. Sometimes God wait until things seem impossible. Sometimes God wait until things seem out of cater, until things seem out of hand. But with God, all things are possible. Everything is in his hand. He is right in control. He is right in charge. He's still on the throne this morning. Whatever you need this morning, he's still on the throne. Whatever sickness, whatever challenge you are facing this morning, God is still on the throne. And he's still able to do something about your condition this morning. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, and he said, "Why make ye this a do and weeping and so on?" He said the damsel is not there &gt;&gt; but she is sleeping and the Bible said they laughed him to scorn. &gt;&gt; He let them laugh. &gt;&gt; He let him laugh cuz sometime you laugh the first time it sounds sweet but but it gets sweeter the second time and the third time. And they laughed until he his name was a disdain. They laughed him until he was a heretic. until he could be seen as no more than just a a mad man who has come long after the fact to try to do something about a situation that is too far gone to do anything about. But with God, all things are possible. And he didn't say what he said idly. He is a God that could speak and could back up what he speaks. Oh, she is not dead. She is sleeping. Not only that, I'm going to prove that she is sleeping. We have come to wake her up from sleeping. Oh, isn't that right? And they laughed him to scorn. But the Bible said when he had put them all out, he get rid of them. He taketh the father and the mother. Oh, let them be witnesses of what is about to happen. If nobody want to believe, you sit here and see the works of God. And the mother and the father and Peter, James, and John in their was in the room with him. And he took the damsel by the hand, and he said unto her, "Damsel, I say unto thee, arise." And straight away, the damsel arose and awaits, for she was of the age of 12 years. Oh, and she rose from the dead. Oh, hallelujah. May you rise from your ashes this morning. Oh, may you rise from the newness of life. Oh, he promised to deliver you. He promised to restore you. Isn't that right? And the bride today, she is sleeping. She's in a state of slumber. She's in a state of coma toes. In this message, the Bible says while the bridegroom tarried, musician can get ready. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and they all slept. And the prophet said here, he said, "No, that's the reason today that revivals were supposed to have that denomination's revivals. We haven't had a real stirring. No, no, no, no. Don't think we've got revivals. We haven't. They've got millions and millions of church members, but not a revival nowhere. There are churches, churches, brides, brides all over the world, but there's no revival nowhere. The bride hasn't had a revival yet. There's been no revival. There been no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet. We are looking for it now. The prophet said it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again. He will send it. He promised it. Oh, and that's what we're waiting on. No other life could work in this bride. But these seven mysterious thunders have got to thunder to the bride. Oh, hallelujah. Once more this world will hear direct from God. Oh hallelujah. That's the life that will work in you that will raise up what was once dead and quicken into life ever more. He said listen here. He'll send it. He'll promise it. You can begin to stand. He said now watch. He said there was voices but all how we need in Jeffersonville is thousands of live voices. That's the thunder of God. Thundering out in sweetness and holiness and purity. Undefiled lives walking around in the earth today. You can play something softly. Without a blemish. Yes, sir. Real Christians. That's the thunder against the enemy. The devil don't care how loud you can holler. The devil don't care how much you can jump, how much you can do or this or shout. But what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God. Say anything to him. Call him anything. Just as sweet as it can be and move right on. Oh my. That throws him away. &gt;&gt; That's the thunder that'll shake the devil. Oh, hallelujah. Do you believe it this morning? Amen. Amen. He said, "Well, just like you could say he could preach like Billy Graham or Roberts, some great influential speaker." He said, "No, the devil. No, no, no. The devil just laughs at that. He don't pay no more attention to that than nothing. You can get all the theology you wanted to and all the seminary training &gt;&gt; and the devil just sit back and laugh at that. &gt;&gt; But when he sees that life, &gt;&gt; oh my, that's what makes the difference. He said, look at those disciples down there, that maniac child with epilepsy saying, "Come out of him. Come out of him, devil. Come out of him." The devil just sat there and said, "Aren't you making a pretty shame of yourself?" He said, "Jesus told you to cast me out, and not one of you can do it." He said, "But brother, when they see him come, &gt;&gt; one come walking quietly." Uh-uh. Oh my. He didn't have to say nothing. &gt;&gt; That devil was already scared right then. He knew he had to leave right because here come alive. Not only a sermon, but a life. And it said, "Come out of him, oh my." And that done it quietly. And he knowed what he was talking about. He knew what he was doing. May the Lord bless you this morning. I'm finished. May you come to life in your time and season. May God bless you as we sing and worship the Lord. Amen.

I say unto thee, arise. She just spoke it and it was done. Father, may we leave here on speaking condition with you. Bless your sons and daughters. Bless your children here in our midst.

We must witness to everyone we meet. And in every song we sing, we must tell them the sooncoming king. Just pause one minute. You know, as you sing that song, that's a beautiful song. When last have you testified to somebody? &gt;&gt; When last have you invited somebody? When last have you given somebody a word from the Lord? to encourage them to come out to hear the word of God. I want to encourage you to do that because God have to work. But Anthony said God spoke to the waters to bring forth creatures. He spoke to the earth to bring forth the beasts. God is speaking to you through you that there'll be other sons and daughters. Somebody testify to you. Who are you testifying to? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we shall work while living in this day, &gt;&gt; spreading the word of God as we walk along the way, willing to do his will. spreading the word of God till it reaches throughout the hill. We must witness to everyone we meet and in every song we sing. &gt;&gt; We must tell them about the soon coming king. Oh, sing in me. word just while it is spreading the word of God as we walk along the way willing to do his will. spreading the word of God till it reaches throughout the hills. We must witness to everyone we meet. And in every song we sing, we must tell them of the soon coming. [Music] The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
