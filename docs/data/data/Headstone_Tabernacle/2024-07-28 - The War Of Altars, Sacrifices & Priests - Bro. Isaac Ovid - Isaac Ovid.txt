it is the anointing that has demons under run it is the anointing that carries your healing oh Blessed Be the name of the Lord hallelujah well it's certainly a great privilege and an honor to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen and uh I'll share a few comments but I want to just read the scriptures first so we could get settled in this morning I want to read from three portions of scripture reading from the book of Ephesians chapter 6 also we read from 1 Peter 2 and we read from Revelation 5 this morning Ephesians 6 and reading from verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities that's one against Powers that's two against the rulers of the darkness of this world that's three against spiritual wickedness in high places that's four wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand let's go to 1 Peter 2 and ver9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that he should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time pass were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained mercy and our last scripture reading Revelation 5 reading uh from book verse 8 and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Hops and golden vials of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word shall we bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we are so grateful this morning to be able to Lord walk into your house of praise your house of training and teaching and correction and Lord your house of worship father Lord where we could come and bring our sacrifice to you and Lord where we could come and lift up your holy name and we could acknowledge that you are God and you could acknowledge Lord that you are our King you are our ruler Lord that Lord you have absolute control of our lives and the Affairs of Our Lives father so we come this morning to give you glory we come this morning to give you worship we come this morning to give you honor and praise father any man could read the scriptures but it takes the Holy Spirit Lord to come and bring the scripture alive to us so father may you walk out the pages of the Bible Lord may you take me out of the way may you speak lip to air to your children may you break shackles of their past and shackles of failure and shackles of doubt and depression and whatever it might be father so that we could walk into a newness of Life father may your Holy Ghost move upon your people may you Lord speak to lives and transform Lord both those who are in the sanctuary those that are connected online father we know you have something in store for us because you didn't bring us together in vain you didn't just bring us together for a formality father Lord you abore vain Worship You abhor the ritualistic worship so father we come this morning Lord as Lord a new day a new opportunity to get right with God we come this morning looking for a fresh manner from Heaven father Lord knowing that your food is new and fresh every morning Lord help us Lord by your Holy Ghost to rightly divide the word of Truth this morning that we could be better servants we could be better Christians we could be better Sons and Daughters father get glory and honor to your Holy Name Lord your name is lifted high and you are high and lifted up this morning Lord you are bigger than our problems you are bigger than our mistakes you are bigger than Lord our shortcomings Lord you are bigger than Lord the pains in our bodies you are bigger than our fallings and our failures Lord and the purpose the Divine Purpose that you have placed us here our purpose is our protection our purpose is our comfort our purpose is our joy Lord help us to walk into the fullness of our inheritance father Lord if there's anyone sick Lord before the service is over may they be completely healed Lord Lord not just a touch but a complete healing if there's anyone back s in here this morning may they be totally delivered not just a partial Deliverance father but a total Deliverance if there's someone seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost father it be completely filled from the crown of their heads to the SS of their feet father God if there's someone connected online May the Holy Ghost move father move through the Airways father and minister to the years of Salvation and when it is all over may you get glory and honor to your holy name in The Mighty precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says can we give the Lord a shout of praise amen you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord well it's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord this morning certainly good to be able to lift our hands in worship certainly such a privilege to be able to say Lord you are good Lord you are worthy Lord You Are Holy Lord there's none like you from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same your name is exalted because wherever God is there's a sound of holy holy holy are you Lord Hol holy holy is the Lord God Almighty who art and is and is to come blessed be the Lord God Almighty it's impossible for God to be present and there's not a rising up of Praises so that the glory of God can move in our midst hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord how many appreciate the convention how many appreciate God's servants who came and Minister all the greetings and the singings and the worship and we know it our shadow of a doubt we are closer to leaving this place we are closer to walking on the neck of the devil the devil is shaken because the moment you realize who you are it's finished oh Hallelujah I'm so excited to know that we are coming into the fullness of realization there's partial realization and there's a fullness of realization when you look into the mirror of the word and you see Jesus looking back to you you may be seated so certainly once once again on behalf of the office of the pastor we want to really salute the church for your labor your sacrifice your efforts financially physically your presence your support for all of and and we know that your reward is going to be tied to this effort to this sacrifice God rewards a sacrifice he sees everything your prayers there was a memorial in heaven for Cornelius prayers your prayers are being recorded God is recording every action he's recording every time you lift your hands he's recording every every time you say God bless you he's recording every time you come to church he's recording how you go on your job he's recording how you speak to your wife he's recording how you speak to your husband he's recording how you speak to your children he's recording how you press past your limitations he's recording when you shake yourself and say I know I'm tired but there's something more than this physical being that needs food and he takes a note that you came to church this morning when you had an option to stay home something pull you he took note of that oh come on now somebody speak back to me this morning Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah so I'm an expectation for God to speak to someone's heart and know he will he promised to do it and to see how time is unfolding and I don't know how many of you have seen it but in the Olympics just opened the French Olympics and it's been over the news it's been over the media different companies have pulled their sponsorship from the French Olympics based on the opening ceremony you know and I was sharing with my wife if you take a picture of a worldly concert whatever kind of concert it is if you just take a picture from a distance what you will see is people hands raised and there's somebody on the stage and if you take the picture of a church convention you will see people's hands raised and you will see someone on the stage unless you know which one is which from a distance it looks the same because it has always been about worship the fall and Satan leaving heaven to create the situation was always about worship he wanted the worship that God had and that has been now reflected till over the French opening of the Olympic the symbolism and the imagery and the way it was done a a display or a counter display of the Lord's supper and there's a calf and there's a horse and all the symbol is almost like if you reading the book of Revelation and some spiritual being is there orchestrating because we are being influenced by the spirit world and it's so blatant that the media is saying and most of the news you go go look at it most of the news media saying the how could they insult over two billion Christians and the reality is there are those who saying they're not going to watch one more Olympic sport but that's not true people are still going to go watch it because they are slowly training the people for the spiritual realm this is their convention you know and with the eyeballs on the Olympics they took an opportunity to drop seeds into the hearts of the people and that's what the devil has been doing through movies through songs through all of their movements and the lgbtq and all these things has meant to almost normalize what brother brandham saw when he went down to Hell to see what is going to normalize it so we don't want to be ignorant of Satan devices and we have to realize that we are in a Warfare and there's a spiritual war that's going on that that we were born into this war we didn't just sign up for it we were born into the war the war started before we were here the war started in heaven but we were caught up in the thoughts of God and God in his thoughts he had you in his thinking he had a me in his thinking and he choose his best soldiers for this day his best weapons he left for this day Sons and Daughters of God who will come to a full manifestation because the word will grow into them and the spirit will power that word can the church say Amen oh I feel good this morning so just for a bit of a thought has been on my heart for some time and I was sharing with B over briefly before the service that we have been touching this in different ways but I preach a few messages touching this I've touched some parts of it as well but I want to speak this morning on my titled the war of altars sacrifices and Priests a war or the war of altars so there's a war of altars there's a war of sacrifices and there's a war between priests and if you read through the entire scripture the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation is about this spiritual war a war between altars a war between sacrifices and a war of priests and you have heard it before because I read the scripture you are a royal priest you are part of a royal priesthood so every single person in this room is a priest but I have news for you every single person on the earth is a priest because but abam t as anything could be your God because God is the object of worship and every God has priest every God has altars and every God has sacrifices so you hear singers and musicians they sell their soul to the devil people talk about to be able to get popular or so they make a deal with the devil they give up their soul they sacrifice their soul for popularity for money that's a sacrifice they make at the altar of their God can the church say Amen no wonder God told Moses thou shal have no other gods before me because God was teaching them from way back then there are multiple gods out there gods of your imagination different Idols that people have different ceremonies that people do different things that people do and we in the in the realm of the spirit ought to understand that this is not a flesh and blood thing Hall I read the scripture for a purpose for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places the battle is not you and your boss it's not you and the government it's not you and your brother it's not you and your sister it's you against principalities you against Powers you against yes you against the rulers of the darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places four things we are fighting against this morning we are fighting against principalities we are fighting against Powers we are fighting against the rulers of tactic of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places when you see that we are more influenced by the hidden realm than the natural realm you begin to readjust your position and realize how much of a prayer life you're supposed to have and how much you should cherish the worship you bring to the house of God oh you don't hear me this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah because any wor ship that doesn't go to the real God the true God goes to some other God somebody preach back to me but Bram said you can make your car your God you can make a job your God you can make money your God you can make music your God you can make an idol or God but our God is a jealous God he wants all your worship he wants all of your sacrifices he want a clean heart he want a clean altar he want a clean sacrifice he deserves a praise he deserves the glory he deserves the honor oh Hallelujah and I want to tell you church that as a priest there's a war against your priesthood somebody preach back to me your priesthood is being challenged every day you're being challenged what kind of priest are you oh come on now I'm going to teach a little bit you may be seated Hallelujah there's a qualitative measure that God places on these things when God found David he say he found a better man it was qualitative he said by faith abrel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice so your sacrifice could be okay or your sacrifice could be more excellent you don't hear me this morning brother Bram said God Don't Make halfway Christians but a Christian could be halfway God Don't Make halfway priests but a priest could be halfway there's a measure of your priesthood oh you don't hear me this morning there's a measure of your sacrifice is it a more excellent sacrifice is it a are you a real priest oh let me ask the question another way who are you a priest for because all through the Old Testament priests who were once serving at the altar of incense found themselves serving in the altar of BM read through the Old Testament over and over and that spiritual wickedness in high places we read in Ephesians go search high places in the Bible the high places were altars Solomon built the temple but the Bible said he still went to the high places Esau still went to the high places all through the scripture and they did not break down the high places God had taught them their all back to Abraham to raise to build the altars take it on Higher Ground Hallelujah don't cut it with tools because it will defile it just use rocks read the Bible is there there's an approach to God this thing goes all the way back to Genesis what kind of priest are you that's why there's a war this morning war of altars altar against altar sacrif ice against sacrifice priest against priest anybody with me this morning we're not playing church this morning if the brothers help me let's pull up Daniel chapter 10 to show how real this thing is going to teach a little bit a little Sunday school a little encouragement Daniel chapter 10 we going take it from verse one in the third year of Cyrus King of Persia and we can keep the scriptures up on the screen a thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was called belesa and the thing was true so Daniel hears something is revealed to him his Revelation is something that persuades him let's go but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision in those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks in other words the Revelation created a desperation a burden and an urgency that sent him into fasting fasting is a sacrifice so the Revelation drove Daniel to an altar in his home oh you don't hear me this morning do you have an altar in your home do you have a consecrated place in your home where you talk to God can I drive home a little bit how many of you have been to a store or a business where there are images of different deities and what you may not know is that people in these business come early in the morning and they put some food in front of because they understand Altar and they understand sacrifice and they understand and I want you to understand this friends God gave Dominion to this earth to man it's in the word and for God to move somebody has to call him he said I stand at the door and knock and if any man open I can't open unless somebody open for me to open oh you don't hear me this morning when God came down to deliver he said I've heard the cries of my people and that called me into action so until the cry had risen up God couldn't even move for you to reach God there has to be a way for you to talk to God and God put a mechanism in place to be able to reach him it's called an altar for John the Baptist to be born the Bible said his father was there at the altar bur incense when the angel came at the right side of the altar do you have an altar do you have a secret place a secret closet a secret room a place that's consecrated I was sharing brother over it this brought a sensitivity to me of even how we read Bible and thing now we know because we use our phones for WhatsApp and Facebook and all these things and then if this is your main means of Team wood is that the best mechanism for you to anybody with me it brings a sacredness of altar a sacredness of consecration do you still have have a Bible or is your only time I'm not seeing that there's anything wrong with reading the Bible on your phone or no but your phone is corrupt because priests had to dress a certain way cleanse themselves a certain way they couldn't just walk into the presence just like that they had to they had to be a cleansing process anybody with me a war of altars a war of sacrifices and a war of priests so in those days I just want to show you about the war right Danel was mourning three full weeks let's go I ate no Pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did I anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled this was a great burden it was a great sacrifice Daniel is there in prayer and in the 4 and 20th day of the first month as I was by the side of the Great River which is heel then I lifted up my eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were GED with fine gold of hopas his body also was like the barrel and his face as the appearance of lightning is an angel there and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in the color to polish brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude and I Daniel alone saw the vision so he's there with other people but only he could see it because he's in a different Realm he's in a different Channel his altar is right his sacrifice was recognized his voice has been heard and God is allowing him to see what the person next to him cannot see you don't hear me this morning you could be in here this morning and see what nobody else could see oh somebody help me preach this morning and I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me saw not the vision they're right next to him but they can't see it but a great quake King fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves the presence of the god the presence of the Angel The Presence had those men running for cover therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my cess was turning me into corruption and I retain no strength in other words the presence of that angel from the Lord took all his strength away he was not in his human strength anymore his human he just felt weak in the presence of the Lord amen yet heard I the voice of his words and when I heard the voice of his words then was I in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward the ground and behold a hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said unto me oh Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright For unto thee am I now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me I stood true trembling that's a problem today people don't know the presence of the Lord people don't know the awesomeness of it the sacredness of it the fear that comes with it amen and this is what I want to get to then said he unto me fear not Daniel for from the first day that thou did set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself or sacrifice thyself before thy God thy words were heard amen and I I'm come for thy words in other words the only reason I'm here is because you're called anybody with me this morning but I want you to get to this because we wrestle not against flesh and blood but principalities and Powers against rulers of Darkness against spiritual wickedness in high places but young people I want you to catch this this is an angel from the presence of the Lord that responded to Daniel beginning to pray and fast and call upon the Lord but the angel is saying but the prince of the kingdom of Persia yes with stod me one and 12 days in other words for 21 days this angel trying to get to Daniel and a principality is fighting with him and Daniel had to keep praying and his praying kept pulling the Angel and the angel the angel had to fight principalities so I want you to understand when you pray for God to help you and God dispatch an angel to help you that angel have many times to go through principalities to get to you and when you stop praying the Angels stop fighting but when you keep on [Applause] praying I want you to see it's not no game thing you know but L the angel is saying this now imagine Daniel a man on the earth hearing an angel say I was trying to get to you you know but on my way to get to you the prince of Persia come in front of me and start to fight me and I was caught there not for one day not for two days not for three days so when you think nothing happening you don't even know in the spirit realm there's a war taking place to bring Deliverance to your house and brother the Clarence that angel said but L Michael one of the chief princes Hallelujah came to help me so even angels have reinforcement you have reinforcement we need reinforcement what I want you to understand and this is why we come to church there are some battles you cannot fight alone one will put a thousand to flight two will put 10,000 to flight we need one another that's why the Bible say if two shall agree touching anything people think they could just stay home and stand alone stand alone no if two shall agree who is agreeing with you over your situation who's agreeing with you over your problem where is your reinforcement here's an angel from the presence of God caught in battle for 21 days and low if it had not been for Michael one of the chief princes who came to help [Music] me friends there's a war going on between you and I and principalities there's a war going on between you and I and Powers rulers of tness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places you know just com to church fight fight for your family fight for your home fight for your prayer life fight for the Holy Ghost fight for your deliverance Hallelujah don't stop calling upon Him name don't stop calling him he is fighting for you can the church say amen hallelujah it's a real war but we have the victory we already have the victory Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we go so God we we're going to leave that scripture now Brothers thank you God is the object of worship worship is what led to Lucifer's Uprising he wanted worship he still wants worship he wants worship on your job he wants Worship in your school he wants worship from your money how you spend your money is a form of worship how you spend your time is a form of worship because that's the currency of this world it's material and it's time that's the only two currencies we have so in the old days it was the lamb and the Bullock It's money and all these things how you spend your money is an expression of your worship how you spend your time is an expression of your worship who gets the most of your time is your god who gets the most of your resources is your God because it's an expression of your worship it sounds hard but it's the truth because God is the only God that deserves your worship he's the only God that deserves your [Applause] time God first family second you after that put God first make him the object of your worship make him the object je of your praise God must be first Hallelujah you are royal priest servant the Living God your work must be holy your words must be holy your life must be holy because you are [Applause] priests can the church say amen hallelujah no time for backbiting no time for gossip no time for argument no time for political debate that's not what priests have time to do we have time to lift him up we have time to bring sacrifices we bring a sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord we ourselves have to be oh come on now you may be seated for a [Applause] minute the pattern we have to reflect is the pattern that God gave us in know he was always our high priest and our high priest became his own sacrifice and we are royal priest we are supposed to become spiritual sacrifices offering spiritual [Applause] sacrifices and Bram said the altar of God where is it now so you supposed to be a priest you're supposed to be a sacrifice and you're supposed to be a altar wrapped up in this 16 elements God Is Watching because listen oh come on somebody help me this morning the children of Israel at one point you know they were in the wilderness and all these things and they had to keep moving so the T the the Tabernacle had to move and all these things and the Ark of the Covenant effectively was a mobile a mobile altar when the ark moved before them this was the only Army that had singers and Ark before soldiers because there was power in the altar there was power in the altar there was power in the Covenant Hallelujah but the cents the singers and the Ark had to go first when they had to cross on on the the the the into Jericho into the Jordan he said let the AR go first when they go to battle I read it one time he said let the singer sing and when he sing and sing the Lord s a great noise because worship and the act together is a powerful combination you don't hear me this morning so God always had in his mind this thing about priesthood this thing about Ark and this thing about sacrifice so all through the Old Testament they had a point where they were moving when we be moving do you remember one time the Philistines took the ark and they took the Ark of the cember of George into where Deon their God was and and they G fall down because you can't put a Ark that is dedicated to the most high God next to a false idol that have no power these things cannot coexist that was a war of altars you don't hear me this morning and listen these guys didn't understand understand what was going on Sister Crystal because they live back up Deon again and the next day what happen they find Deon D with he head off he hand off and listen it wasn't no man did that the angels of the Covenant the Angels who understand the celestial realm the Earthly Dimension and the power of the altar that represented God's instructions thou shallal have no other gods before me Hall no wonder but the Clarence when David hear the a coming back David start to dance David start to get on he said the altar coming his wife said David you're a minister he said I want to hear about that he said oh come on somebody preach back to me he said you see nothing yet woo yes see nothing yet [Applause] hallah I'm just going to encourage you friends because you and I we are called to a priesthood we are called to maintain our altars and we are called to present holy sacrifice and the Bible said acceptable to God because you could say well Lord I sacrificing I doing this I bringing my offering I'm bringing my tithe I coming to show I God say I don't accept it so is your offering acceptable and I said brother over time accept it it's a me to accept it it's if God accept it so it's a qualitative teaching this morning was the quality of your priesthood was the quality of your altar was the quality of your sacrifice because God Demands a perfect sacrifice he Demands a perfect priesthood he Demands a Sanctified altar can the church say Amen this morning when man fell Adam did his best based on his understanding because he knew he was naked and he covered himself with fig leaves the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so the high priest came down and but brandom said he slay a lamb and give them lamb skin so he operated now as a priest on the earth and in type show them what the priesthood should look like that blood was a requirement and these things so Adam could now walk now with a covering that God gave him can the church say Amen as you go further in Genesis we see two boys growing up Cain and Abel nobody could tell the difference between them just as if many times in church nobody a difference between you and your brother next to you until The Showdown came because anytime you talk about Altar and sacrifice you are actually activating a measure of priesthood so Cain and Abel two priests if I can use that analogy because they both about to build altars they're both about to build sacrifices two priests two altars two sacrifices amen the war of altars the war of sacrifices the war of priests that's while they was setting it upward urance nobody could tell who is who you know everybody working by their own Revelation if you look at the fact that they com in and worshiping they both get the check mark they're there to worship if you give them the check mark on do they have altars check mark If you give them do they have sacrifices check mark But the quality and the nature of the sacrifice was the difference Cain brought his fruits he brought his understanding he brought what he thought God would want he brought what he thought he could have done but Abel brought a lamb and when he cut that thing that thing that blood just spoke spoke for him and that is where the separation took place right there God accepted Abel's sacrifice and rejected Cain sacrifice but the day touching it but the children of Israel against Moab it was seven altars they all had the Bullocks on it they all had and God in Form and Function Moab is looking like Israel know but God didn't accept it he only accepted Israel sacrifice friends this is a challenge to us where's our where what what are our altars some of us TV is our altar you know and we sacrific all our time in front of this altar we have become priests for the Demonic forces from Hollywood who getting their script and their copy be straight from the pit of Hell and our time and our reflection really tells us because ultimately only when Cain presented what was in him showed what he was and I'm saying this morning every single person walking the Earth is a priest for some God whose priest are you which God are you serving what altar have you built what sacrifice have you place on the Altar and that's a challenge for us friends can the church say [Applause] amen I want to reinforce the point that for God to intervene in your situation he has to be welcomed in and I want to say also remember when Jesus went for the across the other side with Legion and then the spirit say have you come to torment us before our time because the spirits knew that they had a time of Torment coming and because they in the spirit realm I want you to understand the spirit realm cannot move without a body so he said so the spirit said don't send us back again know send us into the pigs because we need a body to operate on this realm Spirits are just moving around in the air you know they Spirits have to move into people that's why God is looking for vessels that are sold out that are emptied out so he could step in and take control the same way God is going to fill somebody with the Holy Ghost is the same way the devil looking to fill people with with what he has as well and I want to push a little deeper I was sharing this with my wife yesterday I said people say this is affecting them in their home and this thing is in the home and I'm saying the only way a Spirit come into your home because you have an altar that allows that Spirit to come in I'll say that again when the children of Israel went into Jericho he told them do not take the accursed thing don't touch the accursed thing because when you take things from that Physical Realm that are tight to Spirits into your house you are bringing a channel into your home that's why the old people say burn certain things because you're opening doorways you're opening altars you're opening channels into your home into your life that's why you dedicate your home and these things you know because you want to set up a consecrated space for you to live I want you to understand it's not a flesh and blood thing even on your job have you consecrated your desk I'm bringing real to because people out there we don't talk about it much we we say people hand dirty and this and for somebody hand to be dirty they they at the altar you don't think they OB a man and it's altars they have you know but the brandham stood and the witch doctor brought the storm but the BAM sent his storm back the doctor brought the storm two priests altars at work and until brother BR say I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ he had to shut down the priest because the priest had accessed to his altar what do you think Janes and jambes were doing playing video games they were priests they were getting power from another source it meant they had an altar as a way to pull power from that to do their Stakes as well this is not a flesh and blood thing and he want to walk in and out of church as if no you are priest also are you accessing your right as a priest do you understand the power you have as a priest that when the perfect sacrifice came and the veil was rent from top to bottom it gave you direct access as a priest to exercise your Spiritual Authority as a priest to establish your altar as a priest and they say Lord your son here in need my house in need I needed to to move upon my house but child in trouble and God could dispatch Angels because a priest has made contact through a altar with a sacrifice God always Honors that in the Old Testament you have to bring your sacrifice to the priest the priest had to take it to the Altar and you have to wait there while he examined the sacrifice to see if God would accept it but now under this New Covenant you are your own priest you need to go to any priest you are your priest you supposed to have a prayer life you supposed to have a holy walk you supposed to have a holy life and you have direct access you have a right over access nobody can stop you from moving into the holies of holies Hallelujah are you exercising your Authority in other words you get a new job you say I claim this amen for the honor and glory of God hallelujah I just got here but I claim this job for the honor and glory of the Living God because a son a priest a royal priest has come to work here whatever Spirit was Bing his place I rebuke it you taking control you taken Dominion because man was given Dominion you have [Applause] dominion you may be seated that's why you can't let anxiety stress you out and sick stress you out and worries because you're a priest the problem with us we not exercising our priesthood come on father as you are priest in your house Hallelujah if you have never done it I challenge you fathers when you walk up this evening say as a priest of this house I take every Spirit under my control for the honor and glory of the Living God you are priest in your family you are priest when you sit down to eat your dinner sit down eat your lunch you are operating as a priest your natural occupation doesn't change your priesthood somebody preach back to me you traveling in a maxi doesn't change your priesthood having money having no money doesn't change your priesthood you are a royal priest you are Kings and priest and you shall reign on the Earth [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah consecrate your life consecrate your phone consecrate your email consecrate your your laptop consecrate your desk thr out the unclean thing tore down the false altars the thing that pull your time your attention all these things false altars broken altars part of the role of being a priest is maintaining the altar keep the fire burning keep the incense burning make sure it's done a certain way not a halfway thing no it's the morning sacrifice there's the evening sacrifice you have to make sure there's a morning sacrifice there's an evening sacrifice moment you wake up in the morning Lord I Thank You Lord I worship you Lord You Are God all by yourself oh Hallelujah there's a morning sacrifice there's a evening sacrifice you know [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah Leviticus 16 verse1 after the Lord spake unto Moses and the Lord spake unto Moses rather Leviticus 16:1 after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they had offered before the Lord and died and the Lord said unto Moses speak unto Aaron thy brother that he come not at all times into the holy place with in the veil before the mercy seat which is upon the ark that he die not for I will appear in the cloud upon The Mercy Seat thus shall Aaron come into the holy place with a young bulock for a sin offering and a RAM for a burnt offering he shall put on the holy linen coat and he shall have the linen breaches upon his flesh and shall be girded with a linen girdle and with the linen M her shall he be attired These Are Holy garments therefore shall he wash his flesh in water and so put them on Amen and he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering and one RAM for a burnt offering and Aaron shall offer his Bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and make an atonement for himself and for his house and he shall take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and Aaron shall cast lots upon the Two Goats one lot for the Lord and the other lot for the scapegoat and heel shall bring the goat upon the Lord's lot which the Lord lot fell and offer him for a sin offering and it goes on and on you could you could spend time in this I want you to see the sanctity and the sacredness and the approach we are too casual with the things of God Amen God is not giving Aaron options and choices with how to approach him but the Brandon preacher message approach to God we cannot approach God the way we want to approach him God is setting a standard and all true scripture it's a standard and we want to fight with how to dress and cover your knees and these these baby things you know because God said if you come into my presence and you're not right you're dead amen amen because I am Holy I'm God and I change not we have and we have to begin and treat our homes must be consecrated do you know one time brother brandham they brought brother BR to a meeting and they brought him to a hotel and when he got there they said this is your room brother BR we have here as he steps in he say I can't go in this room fornication took place here the spirit still there you understand he a spiritual what another time going to car somebody inside the car with him and the guy speaking and but say pooke a Blue Streak break the anointing so but BR was very careful who you allow in his car who you allow in the room because it's a spiritual real you might see it you got but it's a spiritual real you have to be careful God who you allowed to talk to you there's some things you don't want to hear there's something you don't want to know there things some things you don't want to see and young people you see music music is a channel no music is an altar music itself self is a channel it's an altar even in the natural in court cases they talk about what music the people listen to before they before they did the drive by shooting because the music put them in an atmosphere to do what they had to do and we know it from the scripture when David played the ha he was able to push Spirits away you can't find in the Old Testament casting out the demons but music was used to move the Demonic realm and if music could be used to push Spirits away then music could also be used to draw the Holy Spirit to you what music what music forms part of your altar part of your worship what music do you play in your house in your car as a priest I'm challenging us because you wonder the victory you want to overcome and asking how can I overcome and these are the things that you have to be so mindful of so sensitive because you a priest I don't know who this is to help but I just want to make sure you understand these things worship is so built so that while Moses is up there any Ten Commandments what they doing what Giants and Jes lead them to do make a God and make an altar golden calf and an altar to offer sacrifice to the golden calf think about it and the children who would just delivered they there jumping up in the party because it's built into us to worship let's go to First Kings 18 and I want to deal here with Elijah because here's another example we know it the children of Israel true Biblical history you see many times God said them right and before you know it there's some false god and in case of Ahab Ahab brought Jezebel in and Jezebel brought her deities and with her deities people start to erect altars to these false gods and in the result of doing this no one was maintaining the altar of God so the altar of God is run down it's broken First Kings 18 verse 17 and it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth Israel and he answered I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy father's house in that you have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and thou Hast followed bam now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount carel and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Caramel and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long Hal he between two opinions and that's a message to the church this morning how long you want to be between the world and God how long you between your ideas and God how long as a young person your parents bringing it to church your parents coming to church and you and and but you still there trying to figure out if the world is for you Hallelujah you know when they come here you feel something amen you know there's a pull on your heart there's a yearning in you for something more so Elijah looking at them and see them caught in incision because leadership is corrupt Ahab has led them astray but you still could choose so he say how long will you halt between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bail then follow him and the people answered him not a word nobody say anything somebody church just quiet people just there nobody answered they they caught and then Elijah said unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but Bale's Prophet are 450 Men Let Them therefore give us two Bullocks and let them choose one bulock for themselves and cut it into pieces he's talking about the sacrifice now and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and I will dress the other bulock and lay it on wood and put no fire under and call ye on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that answered by fire let him be God and all the people answered and said it is well spoken because at the end of the day when we see fire we know it's God can the church say amen and Elijah said unto the prophets of Bale choose you one Bullock for yourself and dress it first for ye are many so Elijah turn to him he say it's plenty of all you I don't know how all you go and cut the Bullock I don't know how all but I know it's plenty all so all you fix all your mix choose your sacrifice first this is a war of altars a war of sacrifices and a war of priests call on the name of your God but put no fire under and they took the bulock which was given them and they dressed it and call in the name of ba from morning evening until noon saying oh Baal hear us but there was no voice no any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made that's why when you see people jumping and shouting you have to be careful what they doing or know because not all jump and Shout is to the true God they out there doing all kind of thing trying to get this thing to work but it can't work can the church say amen and it came to pass at noon that Elijah mugged them and said cry aloud maybe your volume is high enough for he is a god lower case G either he is talking he can't multitask or he is pursuing running after something or he is in a journey or per Advent he sleeping and must be awake but I want you to catch these people are following their conviction you know they are say this thing I working you know and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner cutting themselves is a form is is a sacrifice so they actually increasing their sacrifice to get this thing to work I want you to understand the spiritual Dimension here at work after their manner with knives and until the blood gushed out from them it's not blood rush out from them they are now doing blood sacrifice these are children of Israel turned to blood sacrifice in honor of their false god and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded in other words people had to give up and see this thing look like it really working and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me hallelujah hallelujah look at the confidence of a son this is a priest Prophet priest in in action now he's about to go to the altar he's about to go perform the sacrifice and in this is a great teaching for us come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down in other words he didn't just go and start to put his sacrifice in place he said this thing need to get fixed first we can't try to offer sacrifice if your altar is broken this this altar is not as it should be and if you right now have an altar that's broken we need to repair it first before we can go and offer sacrifice on it can the church say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah if your family alter is broken get it fixed if your prayer life altar is broken get it fixed let's fix it today let's restore it today Young Brother young sister repair your altar today [Applause] you cannot present your sacrifice if your altar is broken can the church say amen and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the bulock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water so he did what they didn't do he made it almost impossible for fire to catch because he is so confident that the altar is restored he is so confident that the sacrifice was worthy he is so confident that his priesthood is in order that he doesn't have no fear he has no doubt he said come closer he's not ashamed to say come see something come see the manifestation of the sons of God come see a manifestation of the Holy Spirit My Heart Is Right with God I'm not leaning on my understanding there's nobody else standing with me he say I even I alone I'm here but he's confident in his priesthood he is confident that the altar is restored and the day you could stand confident that your altar is restored you could see the host of Heaven Rejoice with you oh come on now Church oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order so the stones would already in place now he put the wood in order and cut the Bullock in pieces I want you to notice it's in order there's a structure there's a system isn't a feeling something no there's a certain way to approach God there's a certain way to come to church there's a certain way you come prayed up there's a certain way you leave even Jesus said when you come to the alt he said when you come to bring your offering if you have ought against somebody leave it there go make it right and then come back oh God there's an approach to God there's an approach to the altar can the church say Amen is that playing church let the god that answer by fire let that God be God can the church say Amen if your altar is broken this morning I I want you to fix it hallelujah hallelujah and he put the wood in order and he cut the bulock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels of water and pour it under burnt sacrifice and under the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time other words I don't want you to wonder if I had anything to do with it I want this thing to look impossible put more water put more water put more water this is not manx this is not a performer this is not a Pentecostal church trying to make something happen no and the water ran round about the Altar and then he fill the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice so Elijah is sensitive of the time he's sensitive of the season it's the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice the brothers were backs they didn't understand evening sacrific they had forgotten all these things but here it was Elijah has restored the altar thank God for Elijah Prophet William Branham Malachi 4 who has restored the altar restored the faith restor the fullness of the word tie up every loose end reveal every mystery showed us how to struct to the altar showed us how to walk in harmony show us how to forgive our brother show us Faith all the way to charity show us a promise of a Rapture promise of a resurrection promise of a new city promise of a body change promise of seven Living Voices promise of seven tunders Gathering a bride a promise of seven tunders showing a bride how to go so we can come boldly to the throne of God and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy Word in other words he's praying there hearing him he's saying Lord I'm not coming with my own idea I'm not coming with my own Revelation I don't have my own inspiration because a true prophet of God is a vessel that allows God to speak through them he is just a microphone I am just doing at your command I want the people to know that what they just saw wasn't my interpretation of what should be done but what I just did was what you wanted me to do Lord make a servant to do just what you want us to do so Elijah is praying on a foundation that I have done all these things that I would hear me oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again you see those words and those are the same words like our Elijah turn the heart back again turn the heart back to the faith of the fathers this is the first Elijah in Hallelujah can the church say amen amen then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the god and Elijah said unto them take the prophets of Baal let not one of them escape and they took them and Elijah brought them down to the brook hean and slew them there amen and Elijah said un Ahab and now listen now now that the altar has been restored now that fire fall he said Ahab get thee up eat and drink there's a sound of abundance of raino Hallelujah Hallelujah in other words God was waiting on the restoration of the altar to send rain soon the altar was restored rain could come ahab's still in a condition you know but the altar has been restored once altar is restored I hear the sound of the abundance of rain and I'm under expectation for some altars to be restored in this church I can't speak for any other church but I'm looking for some altars some men to take their places some sisters to take their places restore the altars of your prayer life restore the altars of your sacrifices restore your priesthood oh Hallelujah and I tell you once the altar is restored I hear the sound of the abundance of [Applause] [Music] BR what does this teach us God's covenant and his manifestation are tied to his worship because the hour cometh and now is that the true worshippers will worship in spirit and in truth how God could send rain and there's altars erected in your life against false gods how could God bless you and you have false gods false Idols false altars but the moment Elijah say kill all the priests break down all them altars now the true altar has been established true worship has been reestablished true sacrifice has been established it's not just my word saying it has been established but the fire of God has proven God has accepted this sacrifice God has accepted that the altar has been restored he has consumed it he has burned the offering himself he has honored the priesthood he has honored the altar he has honored the sacrifice father Let the Fire Fall go tell them I hear a sound of the abundance of rain Elijah is in the prophetic woo and I want you to see something here now catch this the altar is restored the priesthood is established the sacrifice has been accepted Elijah is speaking by the PO in the spirit real he said I hear the sound of a bonance arain and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up eat and drink for there's a sound of an abundant rain and Ahab went up to eat and the drink and Elijah went up to the top of Cel and he cast himself down upon the Earth and put his face between his knees and he said to his Serv go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing so I want you to catch something now Elijah is in the spirit realm he not in the humanistic realm so when he say I hear the sound your B of rain he's in the spirit realm know this sound a reached them yet the clouds a reach yet but he knows that once the altar is restored once his sacrific is accepted once the priesthood is recognized there has to be a manifestation of God that follows a restored altar there must be a manifestation of God there's a connection between a proper Altar and God's covenant back to Abraham it is when Abraham went to offer Isaac and God to stop him he say okay look I give you a provided sacrifice after that he said now I know you believe me now I know you follow me he said now thy seed shall possess he tied a covenant to the altar [Applause] so you looking for God to do something in your life restore your altar get the sacrifice in order get your prayer life in order get your life cleaned up break down the false altars break down the your prayer life in a mess rebuild it get your Bible in your hand get your spoken word books in your hand get your consecrated Place get a spot in your house where you get bagged at the knees and say nothing else here but God and my go in your secret closet oh come on now somebody help me oh it could be in the back of your house it could be in the corner somewhere where just you and God Alone is say Lord I'm making my altar right here you're not doing it for sure is there anybody with me and it becomes your daily altar your daily sacrifice your daily worship your daily prayer your daily consecration in the morning and the evening the morning sacrifice the evening sacrifice and your faith growing you're reading the word every day you're praying every day and the quality of your priesthood is just Rising the quality of your altar Rising the quality of your sacrifice Rising holy acceptable pleasing unto God you begin to turn down the TV turn down the radio turn down the social media turn down the internet because you realize in you are more a priest than an accountant you are more a priest than a secretary you are more a priest than a policeman you're more a priest than even a deacon you're more a priest than even a minister you are royal priest [Applause] oh I feel good Elijah is so convinced no wonder the prophet of God could say it's so close I could almost feel it he said there'll be a super Church there'll be a super race as we near The Headstone it's almost here I could feel it he was seeing the altar restored he was in the fullness of the word in its place no loose and every mystery revealed he know all the material is here he say Rapture and Faith lay in the message it's just a bring the pieces together oh woo friends when Elijah repaired the altar those stones he didn't bring a truck with stones you know those stones were there they just had fallen away he went at fixed back put this piece restore the ancient landmarks bring back the prayer meetings bring back the old fashion bring back a Revival he didn't bring new stones and say listen hold up hold up let me go on and bring the truck with what no the same quotes the same scriptures the same word the same word more positive that's how we raise a standard the same quotes the same tapes it was there all along but nobody was tending to it brother kangali so when Elijah came he looked around he said this one represent the tribe of Judah oh God this one the tribe of Zebulon this one the tribe of God this one represent Faith this one represent virtue this one represent knowledge this one repr represent Temperance this one represent [Applause] patience and once restored fire has to fall because God respects his sacrifice God honors his altars and we said it before a altar like I heard somebody say this Earthly realm we live in spirits need permission to operate here so the children of Israel cried and God say I've heard the cries and I'll come down in response we saw Daniel reach out to Heaven by fasting and brother over always says it brother said it fasting amplifies your prayers so when Daniel called then the angel respond he said I've come because of your words if you didn't call I wasn't coming but an altar with a sacrifice is a direct access for God to drop down that fragrance that oh my good that's right brother Anthony it's a hookup it's a connection God sees the altar he say I can land right here I can make my presence known right [Applause] here hallelujah I heard somebody say a altar is like a runway in an airport if you have no altar no Spirits could land but when you have an altar than the spirit land the kind of altar you have determine what Spirit lands so when you ENT worldly music and worldly music is your altar then you have a set of planes coming in your immigration line crazy and this war of altars and that's why but say this there's these two voices fighting these two Indians fighting these fighting in your head fighting your life because some of us we have two we have competing altars in your life you come to church here and the Holy Ghost come and clean up certain and you start to cut away and and and and the ho go come cold close to you but when you go back in your home or your job your there and your walk we listening to whatever you listening to that open up channels and open up doors and it because the confusion in your life you need to shut down one Runway I don't have [Applause] anybody I don't know if anybody remembers during covid-19 I can't remember which country it was one of the one of these South American or Central American countries at that point they were Banning closing along airports and that kind of different things this country said listen they actually pass parked a plane across the runway because I don't think Co had hit them yet they Park a plane across say nobody Landing they would have taken no chances they Park a plane across the runway so even if they radio and you play get radio say I have no place to land CU they say everything I coming could never spread and this is why it's so much to tear down the false altars to the false Idols because if these altars don't exists you cut off the Demonic realm when we say Satan will be bound for a thousand years friends I want you to catch this if your the microphone on is in the back Brothers the microphone is on if you cut off the Demonic Realm by having no Altar for entry how the enemy going to move if the devil could find no place inside the hearts of the Believers here the devil is powerless let me say that one more time if Satan cannot find a grip on one person in this room Satan is [Applause] powerless and the more you get sold out to God and the more the enemy leaves your life is the more power you have to [Applause] overcome and there's a reason there's filling and refilling and they will refill again because the reality is you want to keep this thing top until it running over until it's fully consumed until there's no room there's no place there was no place found for the devil in heaven you know and we have to reach the point that there's no place found for him on Earth also and no place found for him in your Earth also and but the brandham gave us confidence he said a man could live such a life the devil don't even know what to do with him can I say that one more time but say you can live such a life the devil don't even know what to do with you he say you know what I didn't even stress myself there has to be easier Target there has to be the devil get stressed out he trying to get you this way and this way but you put on your whole armor you know we wrestling against flesh and blood so he come you have your Shield you have your sword you have your breastplate they will say okay and listen you talk to any security professional they would tell you that how the the the the criminal elements working they look for soft targets because it's real work to go after a heart Target if you have two houses one with one dog and one with 82 dogs you had to be a foolish criminal to go on 82 dogs are going brave no you'll go after the one with one dog and there comes a point where you as a son become so fortified when you walk like when Jesus H there and Legion and them say they say listen listen listen you come to talk many because they recognize the power that was in Jesus and you know what that's what Jesus is played is promised his end time bride when you walk his street demons start to cross his street demons start to change and disguise they don't want you to see them know because you have power in you greater is he that's in you than you that he that's in the world do you understand that the greatest trick the devil has to play on you is to let you think you are less than you are can I say it one more time the best weapon the devil has with a punch is to deceive you that you have no power that's why but Brown said the moment the bride gets to know who she is the moment you realize that I'm a royal priest you are a king and a priest this entire service we talking about priesthood but you are King also and King means power and authority rulership and governance Hallelujah and that gives you the right to Reign on this Earth over every principality over every power over every unclean thing [Applause] Hallelujah do you understand that your worship is the most precious worship the Angels can't worship like you the Angels can't sing Amazing Grace oh hallelujah it's not the same when you sing Holy Holy Holy God loves this more than when the angel sing Holy Holy Holy because he paid a price for you he didn't pay a price for the Angels oh you don't hear me this morning he didn't pay a price for the Angels they were created but he purchased you the greatest sacrifice you are his most valuable purchase W your worship has a fragrance of sweetest [Applause] fragrance hallelujah hallelujah when you say holy holy is the Lord Lord You Are Holy Lord you are worthy Lord you are righteous Lord you are Mighty there is none like you God gets excited he gets excited he comes draw closer to [Music] you Hallelujah and listen friends it's a war of altars a war of sacrifice and a war of priests and I am here to encourage you your altar will win your priesthood will win your sacrifice has already won it was the perfect sacrifice there is no sacrifice to compare with the perfect [Applause] sacrifice hallu oh hallelujah hallelujah that's why just like Elijah we can be confident we hear the sound of the abundance of rain because our Elijah has restored the altar every word every stone every wood everything in its place [Applause] now it's up to us as individuals you may be seated we are Kings he is the king of kings we are priests he is the high priest there's a relationship you don't hear me this morning God not rolling alone he could have if he wanted to but the sovereignty of God has him moving with his prde you don't hear me let me say it one more time God is powerful enough to move alone but he doesn't want to do that he doesn't like being alone he was alone all by himself he didn't like the feeling so he doesn't want to be king alone he wants to be king of kings you don't hear me this morning he doesn't want to be the only priest he wants to be the high priest and have a lot of priests you are Kings and Priests working with the King of Kings and the high priests [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh listen the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof but God doesn't want to be king of the earth you know he doesn't want to be king of the earth he already appointed the king for the Earth I'm looking at the kings of the Earth you are the ones who give dominion Genesis 1:26 let that man have dominion you were always the kings of the Earth but Lucifer with his slippery hands tried to get the title D to this earth and it slip back into the hands of the r w and all these years since Genesis the revelation God has been waiting for the king priests to come back into position you may be seated I'm trying to find a place to land this morning but I feel good to know that he included me brother George simple old me the King of Kings want to make me a king to rule with him the great high priest but the Terry want you to to be a priest with him offering spiritual sacrifice not just offering spiritual sacrifice but he made us [Applause] sacrifices you may be seated to confuse the devil and this is so powerful the amount of stuff God wrapped up in us that David and Moses and them couldn't tap into and I preached it before in the Old Testament you had to be in the T in the tribe of Levi to be a priest you couldn't be a priest out of the tribe of Judah it was impossible kings came froma Judah so you couldn't be a king froma levite so that's why when they talk about Jesus say he came off the order of mzc meaning he didn't come a Levi but he tapped into a older priesthood and Levi the priest that Abraham paid tis to him and Levi paid tis through Abraham to MDC the prince of Salem the Prince of Peace Jesus Christ his theophany King theophany who met Abraham Hallelujah and God but kind reserving that kind of thing for us oh God help me this morning what they could not be by a royal lineage we could become that we could merge a tribe of Judah with the tribe of Levi and we could be both Kings and Priests [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you may be seated do you know the only King priest That Ever Walked the Earth before this end time bride is King Jesus he was prophet priest and King he fulfilled all the law all the prophets were Shadows of him all the priests were trying to be him all the kings were approximation of him none could add up to him but when he sto and he stood there he was King priest prophet Redeemer savior healer Master El Shai Rose of shon lily of the valley Jehovah Gyra Jehovah RFA Jehovah nii Jehovah situ he was all wrapped up in there and he said this feels so good it need more than one of thisall [Applause] [Music] Young Brother young sister Church of the Living God we ought to be the happiest people on the face of this [Applause] Earth the musician get [Applause] ready Hallelujah so the high priest oversaw for the great sacrifice God and morphy himself because he became his own sacrifice he performed his own sacrifice and then he tells us present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice he want to move Beyond sacrifice having to die because sacrifice that should have died already dead so there's no more sacrifice to die except the death of self oh come on now somebody help me but the George it don't need another sacrifice for you you know because the perfect sacrifice already died this is like in the court you can't get charged with the same crime twice we were already tried we already found guilty but when it was time to pronounce sentencing Jesus say take me instead no devil can come and lock you up because somebody already take the charge oh you don't hear me this morning the devil can't come and lock you up because you should have been locked up but Jesus said take me and they took him hung him on a tree and brother Bram said when he died we died with him W but when he rose again we rose with him Hallelujah so you may be seated so when we pray for the sick it's not that we are praying for a new healing you know healing already paid for what we're really asking is for God to manifest what was already done what was already past being made present I you don't hear me this [Music] morning through this eternal inheritance with the Clarence God drop a set of blank checks into the hand of the Church of the Living God and he call it power he call it power because power belongs to God Authority belongs to the church and he give us these blank checks called Power already signed he said in the Church of the Living God lays the power what is that blank checks and brother Bram saw this he say you know what only need to ask for big things you know because whatever you're buying on Earth is bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth it's loose in heaven it's up to what you write you want a small car write small car you want a big car write big car you want so when the prophet was here he said haty write what you want you want your sister healing you want money in bank account you want whatever you want just write it and she say salvation of my two boys and that check you don't have to wonder if it could clear it is always clear he said I give you your two boys Church what will you write on this check this morning and listen it's plenty checks Sister Crystal is not one check per person no Brother Andy it's not one check there's no ration on this check system know is a Everlasting Fountain when you need a check it check there the problem with us in the church we haven't been writing checks I don't know if anybody with me this morning you know maybe I'm the only one because I I feel to run around the building just to forgive me but over can I run outside and come back inside because if you want joy just write joy and hand it up you want your family write family hand it up you want your healing write healing and hand it up you want the Holy Ghost write Holy Ghost and hand it up whatever you need this morning [Applause] [Music] Give the Lord a shout of Praise I'm I'm almost [Applause] done trying to find a landing stripo trying to find a landing strip hallelujah hallelujah you are Kings and Priests you shall reign on the earth Hallelujah the Earth is your inheritance [Music] [Music] but ye have we read the Scripture A chosen generation friends Young Brother young sister you couldn't volunteer for this Hallelujah you couldn't apply for this you were chosen for this thing and if God makes a mistake by the clons he can't be God not my God maybe one of them Idols them FSE God them forse Al but if the God I serve when he choose somebody there's nothing could stop his choice the God I serve if he choose me I don't care what devil demon principality power and if God choose you sister June no devil no sickness nothing can come against you because God himself Choose [Applause] You ye are a chosen generation hallah and go there picking now in groups he did it in the Old Testament the children of Israel as a group came but now individuals called back by name the mystery of who you are the mystery being part of him rotating off the go you rotated off of God and nothing pass nothing present nothing could come could separate you from the love of God listen Not Your Love [Applause] Enough the scripture says what shall separate us from the love of God this is not talking about our love to him you know this is his love to us it was preaching a meeting for his own name's sake to protect his reputation the fact that he choose you means he has to do everything he needs to do to make sure he made a good [Applause] choice Hallelujah that is why when you understand this and you begin to pray then the old say Lord Lord not for my sake I know but for your name's sake them brothers know if you want to reach God tap into his [Applause] reputation because God would never have no other God upsurge him he would never have no principality upsurge him he will not have your mistakes upsurge him he is too powerful for that so for his name's sake he will do everything to make sure all things work together for good to them who love God and are called according to his purpose but ye are I'm trying to close out a chosen generation a royal priesthood and I've preached it before when God told Moses this Moses just those Brothers just had to repeat by Revelation what they were told they didn't understand it he told Moses you'll be a kingdom of priests and Moses had to repeat it Moses but just like the the the the prophet Isaiah a virgin shall conceive how could Isaiah explain that he said that what God tell me just say I saying it Moses say you'll be a kingdom of priests and Moses couldn't explain it but here we see Christ Jesus king priest and now look in this room this is the kingdom of priest Moses was speaking about a gentile race because this wasn't for the Jews Hallelujah a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that he should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light May the Lord richly bless you Church the war of altars sacrifices and Priests I want to encourage you to rededicate your life consecrate your altar if you have not built a family altar build it if you had one and it fall apart restore it it's important he say I'll meet you the I'll meet you in there in that secret Closet in that secret room where it's just you and God it's not a show it's not for anybody else it's not he said when you're praying see when you pray pray in secret so God can reward you openly this is not a public altar now it's a holy life consecrated dedicated to God approaching God a certain way approaching the service a certain way approaching the sanctuary a certain way approaching even the zoom prayer meeting is not a casual thing there's an alter established here in a zoom meeting you know we offering sacrifices and you're coming as a priest how are you approaching the zoom prayer meeting how you approaching Wednesday night service you're supposed to be here we supposed to be here but when you're not here and you're at home are you approaching it as a priest are you seeing the sanctity of it the importance of it the fact that sacrifice is being prepared and laid on the Altar and we're looking for God to accept this Sacrifice by sending fire upon it how are you doing your part with reverence with respect with dedication recognizing that the Deacon the Usher the Elder the musician the technician the all pieces of this this this this whole puzzle that comes together in order Elijah had to establish the altar in order everything had to be in its place I challenge you get in order this is not a rebuke this is just a reminder because Elijah stood there in front of the people say come closer I want you to see how to put the thing in order I want to see these stones that have been here all along put back into their place each Stone representing a tribe and we are cut out in this Stone pyramid with faith all the way to charity every stone have to be in its place forgiveness have to be in its place knowledge have to be in its place charity have to come to seal the whole thing and Jesus himself in speaking of altar he say when you come to the altar if you have a against somebody go and make it right before I come and try to lat at the altar because I can't I can't accept your sacrifice if you have alt against your brother you have alt against your sister it cuts off God's ability to work on the altar the altar is there the sacrifice is there you are priest but that ought puts a hindrance between God's ability to land and come to you at the altar so you're there at the altar it looks as if you're doing what you're supposed to do but that art is standing as a red flag a stop sign saying Lord don't come yet to know he say go get it right so I challenge you church if there's something to make right and friends for as long as we here on this Earth there'll be things to make us to make right because God wants to Humble us he wants to train us he would allow people to mistreat use or even misinterpret your goodness your kind whatever it is not just to just to make sure you understand he is God know to break our own self-righteousness to to create this because the moment we lose the Reliance and God and the sanctity of the sacredness of God having the right and the sovereign to accept the sacrifice because we cannot approach the sacrifice if God have to accept it Hallelujah we come meekly we come humbly we come with our right approach say Lord this is this is what I have I bring my worship I bring my offering I bring my tithes I bring my singing I bring you can't come here with a bad attitude I don't care what happened home leave it at the door how could you offer your anger to God you know how much worries and cares we all have you know much stresses we have to deal with but we need to drop it all aside because we come into the altar how I feel what I want my ambition my dream that have to die because we going to the altar when Isaiah came to the presence of God as he get closer and closer he start to realize more things about himself he never saw before until he came into presence and when he came into presence and the Cheri him there the Sarah there and God himself he said Lord who is me and a prophet of God say I am a man of unclean lips take the coals cleanse my lips here I am I Want My Sacrifice to be accepted I want my praise I want my prayer to be accepted friends we're going to win this war God will have true priests he will have true altars he will have true sacrifices may the Lord richly bless you [Applause] oh let's praise him today oh give him glory give him honor hallelujah oh all over this place lift your hands and worship him right now and give him glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah restore your altar this morning prepare me oh let's sing it to be a Sanu [Music] oh let it mean something to you
