will be gathered today our hearts have great anticipation for that hour to arise blessed be the name of the Lord and why we are gathered here today Lord is to confess our wrongs and ask for Mercy that's why we face this altar this morning because we know we are mortal and there is many mistakes in us and we are full of fault but we come to confess our wrongs and to look to our Heavenly Father with Open Hearts for the blessings and renewal of strength and faith that he would give us in this hour as we have assembled together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus God may give us the bread of life that we might be sustained for the future that lays before us have the preeminence is touch as sick in our midst heal the we father restore and revive and bless in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen praise God we want to welcome shelan Philip this morning B she's had amen welcome invited by rusin at this time I would like you to turn your Bibles with me we want to go straight into the word this morning to Matthew chapter 16 Colossians chapter 1 and Mark 16 for scripture reading this morning Matthew 16 Colossians chapter 1 and Mark chapter 16 this morning Matthew 16 reading from verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that th John the Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon B Jonah for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou artart Peter and on this rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it praise the name of the Lord reading from Colossians chapter 1 reading from verse 16 for by him were all things created that in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and then we want to go to Mark 16 reading from verse 15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following let us pray one more more time father we thank you for the your blessed word and we pray that you would come down and speak to our hearts Lord feed us the bread of Life feed your sheep bless your people oh God in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated praise God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh praise God Amen how many glad to be here this morning amen amen amen yes sir The rain that's Fallen outside is is rain natural rain we want spiritual rain amen that spiritual reain is what is Promised amen so it's really good to be here and uh I close off last service with a scripture and it was Ezekiel chapter 34 powerful scripture maybe some of you don't even know that scripture is there where God was dealing with the pastors with the Shepherds and speaking to them just want to continue and the word of the Lord is from Ezekiel 34 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the Shepherds of Israel prophesy say unto them thus sayeth the Lord God unto the Shepherds woe be to the Shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves should not the Shepherds feed the flocks he eat the fat he clothed with wool you kill them that were fed but you feed not the flock the diseased have you not strengthened neither have you healed that which was sick neither have you br bound up that which was broken neither have you brought again that which was driven away neither have you sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them and they were scattered because there is no Shepherd and they became meat to all the Beast of the field when they were scattered my sheep wandered through all the mountains upon High Hill yeah my flock was scattered upon all the face of the Earth none did search or seek after them therefore ye Shepherds hear the word of the Lord as I live sayth the Lord God surely because my flock became a prey my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no Shepherd neither did my shepherd search notice God's emphasis neither did my shepherd search for my flock notice it's not the shepherd's flock it is God's flock that is how he is seeing it he's not seeing it as pastor and that is my church he's not seeing that no no no what he's going to ask of them is the responsibility of being a Shepherd over his flock are you with me watch he said I live say the Lord God because my flock became prey and my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no Shepherd neither than my shepherd search for my flock but the Shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock therefore oh ye Shepherds hear the word of the Lord thus sayeth the Lord God behold I'm against the Shepherds and I'll require my flock at their hands and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neither shall the Shepherds feed themselves anymore and I will deliver my flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them and th sayith the Lord God behold I even I will both search my sheep and seek them out so there's a promise in the word that God himself would come down so the one that is after you is not flesh and blood no no no if you are sheep of God the one is after you is God himself that's why first second Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord himself descend from heaven with a shout to seek his sheep out oh praise the name of the Lord that's what the shout is about Hallelujah the shout come to get his sheep do you believe that this morning oh Hallelujah as a Shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he that he is among his sheep that is scattered so will I seek out my sheep I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in a Cloudy and dark day so what a promise we have this morning that the chief Shepherd himself Jesus said I am the Good Shepherd and the Good Shepherd been lay on his life for the sheep and the Good Shepherd went on Calvary and laid on his life for the sheep that his Spirit could be released to go after every predestinated seed therefore there is no way you could miss it you got to make it you got to be delivered he know his sheep going to be trapped yeah he know his sheep is going to be bound but you are going to be delivered youve got to be delivered even Daniel prophesy about your deliverance he said at that time there will be a time of trouble such as never was seen since the world began but at that time Michael shall stand up Hallelujah Michael shall stand up he's not going to sit down he going to stand up and he will deliver every name on the book once your name is on that book your deliverance is guaranteed once your name is on that book you have got to be delivered no demon could hold you no demon of your parents of your past no generation demon could hold you you have got to be delivered God said so you must be delivered you have got to beer God is not a man that would lie if God said it it's got to come to pass God word can't return void God word have power with it God word will accomplish his purpose you are going to be free free from sin free from lust free from unbelief you are going to be free the son of man came back to set you free hallelujah oh glory to God Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord oh Hallelujah so this morning the title of this message this morning is the true church identified by prophecy amen last service Sunday we had the ministry of Jesus Christ identifi identified by prophecy this morning we speaking about the true church identify by prophecy and my inspiration is another book of Acts Hallelujah Discerning the two Spirits at work that's the inspiration another book of Acts Discerning the two Spirits at work now there is going to be another book of Acts yes sir make no mistake about it the son of man came back just like the son of man revealed himself in the days of Jesus he was the son of man isn't that right he came among them and released promises to them promises that their faith was not ready to grasp but promises he released anyhow amen he couldn't release the promise in spirit form while he was with them because he told them the comforter is with you amen but shall be in you amen I will not leave you comfortless but I'm going to come to you a little while the world see me no more but he are going to see me and because I live he shall live also so this holy ghost that was wit in the form of the comforter in the form of the promised word named Jesus Hallelujah it was all the same that was the comforter in the form of promised word he said this promised word that you are hearing now is going to be in you Spirit form not many days hence but I got to do something I've got a price to pay I have a cost to pay that this Spirit could be released to you oh Hallelujah are you with me oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so he walked with these men men with snakes in their heart men with jealousy men with Envy men who was backing men who were fishermen ordinary men many who were smoking and drinking and he released to them promises that their faith couldn't hold yet he knew they didn't have what it takes but that didn't stop it Hallelujah because he knew they would come to it he even told Peter the devil want to sift it like wheat but I prayed for you that your faith fail not he knew they would stumble hlu he knew what they would for but it's not what was going to happen to them it's what God promised going to happen to them oh say Amen somebody he knew they have a rough time he knew they would struggle but he knew power was coming power was always coming it's just they didn't know it oh give the Lord some Praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God power was always coming because God had a plan God have a goal just as you have set goals God have a goal also he wanted to reveal himself Hallelujah it was one of his goals he was just too mysterious Hallelujah he was just too mysterious so this mysterious God want doesn't want to come and make himself more mysterious no he want to reveal himself he want to reveal himself in Simplicity Hallelujah because he was so mysterious that we wouldn't catch it so the Elohim who was so mysterious projected himself in the form of the Loos which was the word which projected itself to become flesh to dwell Among Us that we could handle him that we could touch him that he could be one like us and the Bible said the word became flesh thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord so I want you to notice God there could not be any in between Ministry between the ministry of Christ and these guys they us to wait their understanding how us to be open yes the word had to be open to them amen their faith had to be anointed amen and the evidence of that Faith being anointed is the quality of worship that enveloped them in the upper room Hallelujah because Abraham staggered not at the promise through unbelief that's right but his faith was strong in Praise giving glory to God am so I will know when Revelation strike you I know when Revelation really strike you you cannot sit in church dead because Revelation is when he has revealed himself to you not your mother tell you something in your ear not the Elder Whispers something not somebody text you something but Flesh and Blood have not reveal it unto you but my father had revealed iten amen hallelujah oh glory to God now listen carefully list this is very important you cannot determine who would have Christ Ministry by the pre Ministry of Jesus Christ all right you can't say this looking like it's I go identify it because if you look at Peter denying Christ he was the last man you might think to say this is that that the prophet Joel speak of so you cannot look at what you see because what you think is going to be it may not be and what you think is not going to be God may make it to be because if you look like Apostle Paul he was Saul before he was Paul and he was fighting the Revelation he was fighting the inspiration he was against the Revelation he was against the inspiration amen he was coming to persecute real Believers but that didn't fight God Amen that didn't give God a problem that didn't give God a fight no Paul was always God's man Hallelujah so if you're judging ministers and Ministries before the Fulfillment in other words if you get presumptuous you will mess up things you would say Paul I write him off everybody talking about Saul he against us and he against the true church and that's how people will talk that's man human that is not intelligence of God amen amen because the intelligence of God will say that humans that see this man offbeat and off key have nothing to do with the Divine you see human is not the divine the Divine is sovereignity the Divine is the all teing all purpose Hallelujah intelligence of God hallelujah not the end from the beginning so when Saul was riding his high horse because he felt he was such a mighty man and he had a real high horse and he was riding to with the Christians on that high horse he was mighty he was proud oh my pray for me the devil want to take my voice pray for me Hallelujah while he riding this high horse Pillar of Fire struck him off his High House amen hallelujah Saul sa why persecute thou me listen to the answer who are thou Lord right there right there amen his encounter amen with Pillar of Fire change everything that's right that's right the pillar of fire that's right listen amen was the game changer that's right that's my how many want to Shou on that one huah Hallelujah there is coming a game changer in this message and it's going to be the pillar of Fire in other words let them write you off God hasn't written you off am let them give up on you let them look down on you let them say you are not this you are not that you not the other oh praise God that still wouldn't stop the purpose for your life to be fulfilled and to be accomplished Oh Glory to God Glory Hallelujah so we find out disease plagues is on its way yes we find out the slaughtering Spirits the angels that produce Slaughter is already here yes they have been here since Hitler time that's right they have been here since Roman time the Roman Catholic Church killed 68 million Christians perish under the hands of Rome it was slaughtering Spirits Hallelujah those same Spirits anoint Hitler to kill six million Jews those slaughtering Spirits in Africa by the hood seas and whatnot those slaughtering Spirits is upon Isis cutting off heads what would make somebody do that is a spirit upon them listen but brandham said the bride will be a haunted persecuted group you don't have to wonder how that going to be now they're on the way they say that the Muslim going to rule the world they want world domination right there a spirit that's upon them people leaving back everything because they're hearing about rewards of paradise eyes they heing about rewards of what they going to get when they die and go over Yonder and they're leaving from England they're leaving from America they're leaving from Australia they're leaving from New Zealand they're leaving back family and friends they're leaving back school they're leaving back money and car they they giving it their all to give to this cause that they have what are you doing this morning do you understand it will take more than just coming to church how many understand that do you understand to whom much is given much is expected do you understand that God is expecting great things out of this last day church and if you are part of it God is expecting great things from you Hallelujah Hallelujah not Hallelujah little things that's why Daniel said the people that know their God sir shall be strong Hallelujah and do great exploits not small exploits but great exploits this is not taught much because people feel they have arrived so they are settled and they contented to be where they are so my God God my God my God but we are promised yes sir to do great exploit and brother bham said that the conditions going to be so bad that Divine Healing will be a great thing things going to come on the earth that doctors can't even know what to do that's right you say brother brandham okay let me just Pi up up a little bit he said what he said now he said now one of these days the angel ped his rra disease broke out men rotted in their flesh where they were standing and the fowl of the air came and eat off the shoulders and eat the Flesh of the chief captains great man presidents Warriors diplomats but said don't come near anyone that got the Seal of God in their forehead he said one of these days Divine Healing is going to be a great thing among the church so let's get in condition you say well brother brandham you say let us that that's that was that that's what God is waiting on we are waiting on Jesus to return and Jesus is waiting on us hallelujah what can we do about it the Bible said the hour has come where his bride had made herself ready had made herself ready so remember you think cancer is something the Bible said there's coming a time when men will rot right in their flesh and the buzzers will eat off the carcasses before they even die cancer is a twoot take to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who at the Seal of God that's listen here we go that's what we are striving for now Hallelujah to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of God before these horrible plagues strike oh praise the name of the Lord you love him this morning then strive fight struggle press your way don't ever give up remind God of his promises remind God he promised to fill you with the Holy Ghost remind God his promised to you of power remind god of seventh the Revival remind God that you are his child you are his son you are his daughter you remind God you had a purpose he died for he didn't die for not he died for you oh glory to God Amen you may be seated huah so I guess I'll do a teaching this morning let's go amen this is from the five definite identification of the true church for the brown the word church on each one of these subjects I have chosen tonight uh one of it is what is the church who set it up what is its message how to become a member of it can we get to heaven without being a member of it the word church means called out they were the people of God in Egypt but when they were called out they become the Church of God so the church means the call out ones people that are separated made different so if God called you out the world and you still look like the world you're not called out you have to be called out separated ated look different be different act different therefore the church is not an organization that's right that's right the church is not a gathering of people the church is the people of God that's been called out of the world to serve in another kingdom so you're not called to serve this particular Church the real church is the kingdom of God how many you understand that Hal ujah and that Kingdom of a king the pastor is not the king the prophet is not the king the Apostle is not the king Hallelujah the king is the king that's how you get a kingdom because the king is over a domain and his Dominion is the kingdom over which he reigns am I songing clear to you out there okay so therefore for the church is called out of every denomination out of every religious organization to work with God you're called out not being governed by a bishop but being governed by Christ in this Messiah Kingdom amen and now if Christ is the head and we read that he's the head of the church he is the head of the church not a man from America not a man from Europe he is the head of the church isn't that right and the church is his body Oh Glory to God so in other words if he connects with the body he moves the body whe he said move the body going to move that's why he said Mark 16 says the Lord himself went everywhere with them why that was the body and he was the head come on now say Amen somebody how many understand that this morning the Lord himself went everywhere with them the reason being they were the body and he was the head wherever the head go the body was going to Oh Glory that was another book of Acts it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles and Christ is the head Christ is the head of this Messiah Kingdom and you cannot organize a kingdom of which Christ is the head amen you cannot denominate a Kingdom which Christ is the head because Christ is King and you cannot take the intellectuals of man and make an organization to which Christ will govern Hallelujah therefore that's a backdrop yeah he's going therefore any companies any peoples any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of God is going contrary to the king amen and if they're going to contrary to the king it would be against the king and if it's against the king it would be Antichrist that's pretty rough and if I got a more voice I'll make it clear it's Antichrist and if you bear with me I'll prove that an antichrist Spirit tries to take a people and call them from organization to organization organize them together which never was the will of God people has always fusted me because I struck so hard at organization it isn't the people in it I'm striking at it's that dominating spirit that makes the people think that we are the people you see once that exclusive anointing comes that the people feel that they are it and we are it and they are not it and we are better than them that is the spirit that brother was bosted oh Hallelujah are you with me so God's people is his called out people and I believe they in every denomination they could be Catholic they could be Protestant they could be Jewish they could be any kind of a church but the real church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ and you cannot organize the mystical Body of Christ and every person that comes to Christ comes out of the world comes into Christ into this mystical body so when Christ died here we go he send back the Holy Spirit to make up the mystical Body of Christ that is why one day the last drop of the Holy Ghost will be finished Hallelujah because everyone that's supposed to make up that body will take up that body there'll be no more remaining Hallelujah and the bride will to be on the earth preaching to the Eternal lost people that once had the opportunity to be delivered repent and be saved they still have to hear the gospel in power yes which signs wonders and miracles amen this is not a beauty contest friends this is not who you like and who you don't like this is behold I send you prophets men Sons pastors prophet he going to send out his men his men not a man men not a chosen men not a minister Association men when God sent out his man that is God sending out his man and that's why Paul expressed this way Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God oh Hallelujah do you get what I'm saying in other words not by the presy not by the ministers Association not by the group no by the will of God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord watch is the so watch who set this church up Jesus Christ no Bishop no group of men no Pope no man-made Powers at all what is the message of the church the first church they will teach is repentance yes sir he say show me the church that teaching it now they don't want to hear but repent repent is like a sinful word like a curse don't don't even use that word repent people not repenting they don't want to repent of anything if Christ here we go if Christ would not let a bunch of men who walk with him for three and a half years go preach the gospel could not preach any gospel until they waited for the Holy Ghost yes sir the church today has to do the same thing amen wait for the Holy Ghost the church today have to do what now if you're waiting for the Holy Ghost how could you be the Holy Ghost because that is what being taught now and preached now that bride is the Holy Ghost the bride is the third person of the Trinity Trinity the bride is the holy ghost that doesn't he make sense oh my so brother brandham from Jehovah Gyra 1961 he said now he have to go to Genesis because Genesis is original it means the beginning is where you get where the church started off is where you get a true understanding of the true church and the false church because there are two churches always has always will have there are two Spirits there are two seeds so when you go and trace it he I'm going to go back to the church the true church and before we could start revelation we got to see where the church it where it began and we could go all the way to Cain and Abel and that is exactly the beginning Cain religious Abel religious Abel and Cain both being Brothers came to the altar east of the Eden gate they both worshiped they both make sacrifices they both build churches altars both worship if Building a Church making sacrifice paying your tis everything else even worshiping God is counted for righteousness then and sacrifices to build a church then that's all right that's religion but God refused King what did God refuse he he refuses altar his sacrifice his labor all of that God refused King so it has to be more than worshiping it has to be more than going to church it has to be more than having an altar it has to be more than making a sacrifice it has to be more than that because if if if that is the case God shall have accepted Cain but God rejected K and accepted Abel's revelation of the blood a bloody lamb that gel cut and blood was bleeding upon the Altar and the Bible said Abel by faith or AEL by revelation or Abel by inspiration or Abel without man telling Abel what to do Abel did the right thing and God confirmed by fire the Revelation that Abel had Oh Oh Glory note note let's flip it now and come to Matthew 1716 where we read about Jesus uh ask the disciples who do men say I am now they know men don't know who he is you know who do you say I am you walk with me for 3 years tell me who I am this didn't know but Peter said thou are the Christ then Jesus said these words Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it to you note the words revealed it but my father had revealed it and Upon This Rock Oh Glory I will build the true church my church his church Jesus church is the true church so the church is built on what Revelation oh give the Lord some Praises people the church is not built on a personality the church is not built on a pastor or a man or a real anointed preacher that's not what the church is built on the church is not built because we have 10,000 people that's not what the church the church is not built on Bibles the church is not even built on doctrines that's strong that's a strong one I'll say it again the church is not even buil on doctrines amen amen so you can know all Mysteries H and have all knowledge the church is not built on that the church is built sovereignly upon Revelation and Revelation is Sovereign he reveal it to whom soever he will that is why you can't write anybody off you can't write Saul off because Saul was going to be changed to Paul and Paul was going to be Apostle to the Gentiles you can't do that because when the time come for God to positionally place his sons no man can touch that Oh Glory no group on Earth can touch that oh my so being religious worshiping God isn't that right so watch so there is a way that God comes Hallelujah and that's here we go that's the only way you're ever going to get in there is to come the way God provided for you yes sir and the whole Bible is built completely upon Revelation the church is on Revelation the revelation of the word oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so the spiritual revelation of the the Lord Jesus Christ when God has made him known to you as a person as your savior as your God as your Redeemer as your healer as your king that's how spiritual Revelation come Hallelujah so therefore may I say that the Church of the Living God is built upon divine revelation not upon denomination organization upon Creeds or doctrines on spiritual Revelation so when somebody preach an inspiration or come with some new doctrine or new thinking or new thoughts and people just say that back because they believe what is said that's not Revelation that is you or anybody believing what they say and saying what they say that has nothing to do with Revelation because that's what Jesus asks his disciples who do men say I am and they say some say you are this some say you were that but that was not what he was talking about because people have a right to say anything Hallelujah they are men that's what men say but when the spirit Elohim revealed to Peter that that's the Christ that was not men saying that was God saying and that's why I told the Pastors in India you've got to hear from God that's what I told the Pastors in India I've got to hear from God I told the Pastors in India as if you have the wait for some man from Europe or America to come and tell all all the promises and say you are are lazy amen amen they just watch me and I watch them right back I said and Joshua have a rebuke for you who are lazy how long are you so slack to go and possess your land you're waiting for somebody to give you your land or God give you the courage to go and possess your land when a old man like Caleb said I was 40 years now I'm 80 something years old and I'm just as strong as when I started out give me my Mountain if the Lord be with me I will be able to drive out the enemy that's what Caleb said hallelujah praise God you have to come to that spot where you have to begin to possess your Mountain God want mature Sons why you think this God leave you for the last age for you to be babied and petted and wearing diapers and and wearing Pampers and whatnot when I was a child I spake like a child I understood like a child but God expect you to grow from baby to young man isn't that right praise God young man into father that God could give you further Revelations further Inspirations and give you into the depth of the godhead and the mysteries of the Kingdom being unfolded to you to know who you are to know where you come from to know where you're going to know not only what he is doing but why he is doing it that the intelligence of God even the voice of the Archangel could break upon you to make it clean and clear to you as we get nearer The Headstone it shouldn't be more questions it shouldn't be more mind battles it has to be a clearer a clearer vision Oh Glory to God as we walk to our bright today it become clear Fe you a glass Darkly but then face to face oh face to face we are coming to The Headstone glory to God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah and Isaac shared a powerful thing with me he said if the people see the promises everybody should be forming a beine TOS what is Promised am you know what a beline is a straight line going to something you ever see b or an making a line just make a line towards where they going in everybody falling in line it's food down that way we are going come on fellas and everybody form a straight line you could follow that and look at them look at them look at them look where they going and they pick up the food and they

glory to God so when you see Brethren going wrong when you see nice fine men fine Brethren going contrary to what the prophet said it is a disturbance to your spirit because they are fine Brethren but they off the word plum off the word hall hallelujah so brother B said when a man come to the church there's two ways he going to go formal fanatic formal or some sometimes fanatical but there's a middle ground and the true church will stay on that middle ground oh praise the name of the Lord are you with me no but brandham he was uh dealing with the church ages and it was a very serious study and he said I sought God for many days for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and God did not fail to answer my prayer for while I read the word and the histories I was enabled by the Holy Spirit to see unfolded a pattern that run through the centuries right to the present day so he was praying he was seeking God and God open up him a key and he get a pattern that he could view that was that time straight on the key given to me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger of each age is a most scriptural one in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible it is the Revelation that God never changes and his ways are unchangeable as he is oh that's beautiful that is beautiful it's a key that God never changes Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 138 here it is an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it's the last time God cannot change God is not learning and getting a new inspiration to take something new look Pope Francis the other day he said God God not afraid of new things that that Pope Francis he want the Bishops to confirm homosexuality and and because they fully confirmed he say you know God not afraid of new things almost appear like they have God in the pocket that's right and they could you know I mean God you had to learn this now you know because this thing changing right now and America becoming Sodom and gomorra that's right and if God do condemn that he have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah so America every nation has to be corrupt in the core before judgment strikes and right now I think there about 32 of them uh sign off for this gay marriage and I always I keep saying I wonder if this the same thing coming to close the churches down that they will have to do it or else close down but but B side it will be closed down oh hallelujah what time that going to be where the church going to be when that time comes everything is on a Tinder Box right now it have the Ebola it have diseases it have all kind of condition it have wars it have tension you name it it's got it and the church lulling along lulling along lulling along oh chug chug chug but some t for from the 1940s oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and I have V8 engine and then super turbo engine and all kind of automatic thing and power business and press the button and start the car and people chling along the whole time come we going in Pennsylvania it's that people with horse and there you know and see them horse and and Clarence is amazed that horse with and and buggy have lights in it too in the night time it have lights and my horse and he have this hat and thing and he way back in the age way back they have nothing to do with electricity they have but they have light way back and way back and way back that's how the churches is right now in this Modern Age that people doing the old fashioned old time way give me the old time way I want the old time singing the old time shouting I want that old time how come how come people don't want the old time Holy Ghost how come people don't want the old time fire Hallelujah you see the thing about those people they believe if Jesus come back he will take a buggy and and he will go in he'll go in this is Jesus now this same Jesus he R long G and he take a buggy a buggy ride take a donkey ride but Jesus taking car and plane because he's the same yesterday today and forever because Jesus ve himself in a prophet wearing a hat and a gun and a suit and Jesus was walking all over oh come on now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it was Jesus the Lord himself descended he had to have a body to descend him glory to God a messenger on the earth Hallelujah Mighty Elijah Prophet according to Malachi 4 oh Hallelujah so this is brother brandham if any man shall take away from the words of the prophecy of book let me back up if any man shall add is a dangerous thing to add to say what the Bible didn't say If any man shall add these things go God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the prophecy of this book God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the team that are written in this book amen thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard can I hear a big Amen on that what the church was so therefore I have no authority to watch any other church as the standard that's right as I said last week there is no man on Earth I'm talking about the whole planet the whole big circle with the ministry of Jesus Christ so I don't have to worship no other man because they don't have that Ministry and and God open up some more things to me coning the fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry not no takeover artists the F for not corporate Raiders right you know have corporate takeovers that's right hostile takeover somebody buy more shares and bounce the company out and vote out the CEO and wrestle and take a company that's not the purpose of the fivefold ministry I'm the fivefold ministry I come for your church is that right get out of here you know fivefold you are a false Apostle you a liar I'm going to expose you do you come with that foolishness oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen oh I'm going to teach you you going to learn you may be seated God already identified by the purpose of the F4 Ministry it is for the perfecting not the taking over of the Saints for the edifying not the breaking up of the Saints for the building not the destroying not the disunity not the breaking of Brotherhood that is not any fivefold that is no F at all glory Hallelujah so I'm so glad that God bringing some more clarity to me to understand how it will work because the fivefold ministry is Jesus in the form of five offices not five politicians so you may be see said amen so before before a man can say 5old he in it show me Jesus first that's right no Jesus no fivefold show me Jesus in your life are you with me oh Hallelujah so let's say it again what the church was at Pentecost is the standard sir that is the pattern there is no other pattern no other no other this is the pattern so once we on the word we have the pattern God gave bam the key he say a scriptural key it's a definite scriptural key God cannot change hallah Hallelujah Hallelujah may be seated Hallelujah no matter what the scholar say God has not changed that pattern amen what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church age closes what the church had at Pentecost was an inable right originally she had the pure word she had the power of the spirit manifested with signs and wonders the original church here we go was not organized by by men amen it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated that's right and despised it was oppressed so if you are original Church to pattern after Pentecost you will be hated not loved no no no hated you know where to be hated who likes to be hated nobody likes to be hated you think I like to be blasting and busting no I don't like to do that it's a tough thing to do you think I want to be different from what everybody else is saying it's a tough thing to be different it's a tough thing to speak different the people follow 400 prophets that were saying the same thing and all 400 were wrong only Mah was right because my heard from God hallelujah you don't go by the multitude you go by the word of God you call by the spirit brother colan you might be seated brother keman was right he had a discernment of me he said but over stand alone if you have to that is very true I was built that way Hallelujah built to stand alone let me give you a little testimony I got baptized February 15th I believe 1975 I was 17 years of age coming to this message brother K was coming May of 1975 in between we there I had an encounter with the pillar of fire and that is why I am how I am I had an encounter with God and when I had that encounter it left an anointing in my soul in my spirit that used to Quicken the word from the books into me after that encounter the experience of reading the books was different I remember when I got who is this man I kissed the book my God the word was so precious you almost feel you could eat the book I kiss the book who is this mzc when I read about the mystery of God and before the foundation of the world and before there was a thought and before there was a moon and before there was a star that's why I am how I am you may be seated but I want to go down deeper that Spirit on me when I went and he had the services D shagas shagas when brother keman came there I didn't know who he was I didn't know his name I didn't know nothing about him I just went because the churches were going down to that and when I heard him preach the spirit in me bought record that what he spoke was the truth so no man could tell me what I believe or what I don't believe you have to be out of your mind I was 17 years old you may be seated February March April May four months in a message just four months and when he finished the pastor that I had I went to him I said are you going to preach what didn't remember any name what that man preach Pastor said he had to call Billy Paul I said what Billy Paul has do with this that man that man was quoting from Brother Brown are you going to preach what that man preached 17 talking to a pastor who he in the message he said no I said then I'm leaving I wonder how much 17 could do that pres now I was 17 when I walked out of a church within 5 months of being in the message because my spirit bear record what was spoken was the truth and I wanted to hear more about that because I was hearing about the bride how seven Thunders gathered the bride seven Thunders show the bride how to be and seven Thunder would gather the bride together and seven Thunders give the bride fate and wait till them seven tunders UT the voices of that group they going to slice and cut I was hearing seven Thunder promises and I knew this bright thing I am Part of That Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah I didn't know much but one thing I knew this 17y old knew that bright thing I was part of that oh glory to God oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God I am part of that that's why I have connected since 1975 and next year going to be 40 years so I will not take no crap from any Minister from any Pastor from any So-Cal present Apostle now anyone I wouldn't take any crap from any man on Earth I'm too long in this race oh give the Lord some Praises people oh glory to God hallelujah I'm going to be one hot potato you're going to burn your hand if you try to hold me oh give the Lord some Praises people don't touch me you could watch but don't you dare touch oh oh the spirit of God is upon me the spirit of God led me all these years and he still leading me who are you sit down man you you can pick you can pick up your pen hold your pen right there see I could tell you who I am I wonder who he is GL I'm I'm a local Elder doing the work of a pastor since 1982 for 39 years waiting to be positionally placed by my father that is who I am let's say it again go don't way you miss it I am a local Elder doing the work of a pastor waiting to be positionally placed by my father and that is in his hands the issue for me is not fivefold whether fivefold or not because even if I'm not in that Ministry and I don't want to say fivefold I want to say Ministry for the perfecting which is to pour the virtues into the people which cannot be done by Revelation it has to be done by experience the man have to have it yes to give it if he don't have it he can't give it and if you think I am up there and I know I am down here and I don't let you know I am down here then you will be deceived to think that I am up there and I'll be a fooler where was Peter before Pentecost up where he was at the same height with Mary Mary Magdalene all of them was at the same level needing Dynamics Peter couldn't tell Mary Mary I'm more spiritual than you you know who I am I preach three and a half years she will say but you didn't I Christ what you're talking about and she was right and he was right both of them was right and both of them was wrong because the argument had to cease come on are you with me now so these guys all of them that the issues that the challenges but we're waiting on the promise waiting on the promise I still waiting on page 304 Hallelujah some take it and run with it they have it already they have they have the Holy Ghost now they are this now they the bosses they the said some you get it they the infallible ones have be laugh reading that they want to be po popes poent Bishops the INF Ono the infallible ones infallible means they can't make a mistake infallible on no mistakes can't make no mistake no mistakes me infallible ones oh Hallelujah they're going to the level of infallibility but brother brand you see a prayer Pray part that pray that souls in prison I'm talking about Lord we have so much faults and mistakes and forgive us and cleanse us th souls in prison that 1965 and brother I'm still asking for Mercy we come to the Altar for Mercy for the grace of God we come to confess our faults our sins that's why we come to repent we come to ask God for his grace that's why we come for as Christians oh Hallelujah I said already somebody said a minister preaching talk about we always thought that God is up there and we down here no we up there too we are Gods that's sound good tell at Isaiah Isaiah 6 when Isaiah saw the Lord hand lifted up St fill the temple and I tell God God we I up there to you know go say where your ladder how you coming up here Saras all around burners you can't come with that foolishness you have to confess who is me I'm undone and then the cleansers come you can't even go out with that we have no ladder to climb up God but tell a man God to take God to put a man in position up there you could climb in the humanistic realm wherever you want to climb you could climb in the intellectual realm wherever you want to climb but in that Spirit realm to be positionally placed it will take God to put a man up there and if God put a man up there no man could take that man up there you could lie you could criticize you could say what you want but I know who I am and I know whose I am and I know what God called me to do and I will do exactly what God called me to do oh hallelujah praise God oh glory to God Amen so when I wake up in the morning I wake up with that sense of purpose I wake up with a sense of determination that the purpose of God for my life will be fulfilled oh praise God so are you with me now so brother BR the true church would always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate like the first one and The Messengers to the churches having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul Hallelujah they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that come closest to Paul who was here we go here here Paul credentials closest to Paul who was I call it one free from all men amen hallelujah so he's not obligated to ask brother this should I preach this should I go here should I go here here should I do this here should I open my church down here should I go and fast and pray do you think I should hold a convention no he was free from all men two he was sold out to God sold out sold out to God three watch he give for the word of God only and four he manifested the Holy Ghost in power that is what we have not seen yet that manifestation of the Holy Ghost in power isn't that right so bam said now with this key so simple so wonderful I was able by the help of the Holy Spirit to read the book Revelation and the histories and thereby in each age each messenger the duration of each age the part each played the purpose of God from Pentecost to the consummation of the ages since you now understand how we judge what the true church was like and what she was at Pentecost and what she was in the apostolic age are set forth in the word of God the book of Acts we can apply the same rule here we go to show how the church failed hallelujah amen the basic error or errors that crept into the first church and were revealed in the book of Acts and Revelation and also in the Epistles will become more and more visibly manifested in each in sub subsequent age yes the true church will always try to be like it was in the book of Acts aha we stri some book of Acts you know what happened in the book of Acts the Holy Spirit told Peter go to the house called Cornelius Peter didn't dial up the ministry's council the sing Council or the local Elders or the local ministers Association of God every month he didn't call them because they might have said you know it's not time to move that way you know Peter because there's Jews you know and um and you know Jesus really come to the Jews this his own their own people so we don't feel that um that's a way to go because uh the head of the council it doesn't feel led you should go because we wouldn't be sending you out Jesus Peter was free from all man so when when when when when Peter was told to go to the house of Cornelius God drop a vision God gave Cornelius a vision it was all the operation of God and you know what happened why Peter yet SP these word and then Peter understand that the spirit is not moving over to the Gentiles how the Gentiles who was the outcast people we didn't expect to come in this revival praise God was now getting the Revival people that we didn't expect to get fire now getting the fire the spirit in the bright say come whosoever will come hallu church now when did the CS come son of man reveal himself give them promises son of man come and die at Calvary isn't that right rose from the dead appear unto them I know I keep repeating but you have to get it appeared on them open your understanding isn't that right open up the word to them send them in the upper room and then what they wrote a book of Acts it wasn't the acts of the minister Association it wasn't Act of a group and a leader of the inspiration and the and and a man leading in the book of Acts who the leader the book of Acts philli was in a Revival B say Philip was in a big meeting and the spirit caught him up caught him up and take him to Ethiopian Uno on his way reading scriptures amen and Philip walked up to the man and said you understand what you're reading my god do you understand the spirit sent him there he didn't have to ask permission if to go if to go it was another book of Acts it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in these men that was the book of Acts know what the true church will always try to be like it was in the book of Acts that is exactly right we have discovered that the word also teaches watch an invasion of error until there's a complete back out of Truth when the last thing when the Lord is about to appear the question now arises in our minds and is important how this is phrased does God forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception I I like how he pH it complete deception in other words the elect could get a little tired but not complete in other words God will not let the elect watch go in a state of complete deception on no account for the scripture says clearly in Matthew 24 the elect cannot be deceived but there shall arise false christs and false prophets that shall show signs and wonders if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect what then the answer is clear before us there's a true church and a false Church there's a True Vine and a false Vine of course the false Church false Vine body will always try to ur the position of the true church and contend that she and not the elect are the real and authentic the false will try to kill the true never the other way you will never find the true trying to kill the false you will always try the false trying to kill the true always that's a permanent Behavior kill kill kill kill kill Hallelujah that's what the false will do that is how it was in the book of Acts and that is how it set forth in all ages Paul founded the church in Ephesus about the middle of the first century and this uh enables us to see the date of the first church age 53 ad the very name Ephesus have a strange compound meaning aen at relaxed the aspiration of this age had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of God whereby they were aiming at a high calling of God began to give way to a less watchful attitude a less Ardent following of Jesus Christ begin to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called The Church listen of God would sink to the awfulness of the depth of Satan it had become relaxed and was drifting the age was backsliding it had left its first love the tiny seed planted in the Ephesians age would one day grow in the spirit of error until the fowls of the air would Roost in his branches so inoffensive to human reasoning what that little plant appear that the new EVE the new church that again she would be deceived by Satan the Ephesians age had presented to her the opportunity for God's best and for a while she prevailed and then relaxed and in that unguarded moment Satan planted the seed of complete ruination so when God wants to restore he plants a seed when Satan want to destroy he plants a seed both our seeds planted that is why false Doctrine is worse than adultery that's right false Doctrine worse than that it L an unclean living because he introduced a seed that is contrary to the principles and the doctrines of the scriptures amen hallelujah so watch his manner of ministering talking about Paul set the pattern that all future Messengers were to Aspire to and actually sets the pattern for every true minister of God Amen Paul was the pattern for every messenger and for every true minister of God will follow Paul's pattern though he would not attain the such Heights in the prophetic realm as did Paul Paul had a three-fold quality first he was true to the word he never deviated from the word listen to the scripture Galatians 1: 18:9 though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that that which we have preached let him be a curse what is Paul saying here he's not saying if an angel come down you now he say if I come back and preach a different gospel than what I originally give you sign me off too that's how complete it was in what was delivered he said if we or a angel he put himself inside of there if I come back and deviate from what I originally said let me be a cursed that's how sure the gospel is that's how sure the word is don't compromise with it and brother Joy show me a beautiful there was a sister you know I guess she was well off and she used to write out checks for brother brandham for for the meetings if the meetings fall short she used to cover the checks and so on and day she came to see brother brandham and said brother brandham the ministers would like to you know open up and thing to you more and whatnot if you only compromise on water baptism in Jesus name and there woman right now check this is Brother BR but say sister if I compromise on the word then I'll no longer be a servant of Christ so then she comes with another she said will the minister say if you say the angel of the Lord tell you to baptized in the name of Jesus Christ something like that then they will believe it he say but they experienced tner than Branch water he said if them need that experience T and Branch water he said if the angel tell me something contrary to what the scripture say I wouldn't believe the angel what what is he saying he is saying you cannot put any manifestation above the word I'm not hearing you I am saying the word is first the angel can come with sweat back Wing tall colorful rainbow whatever it is is that angel speaking the word if that angel not speaking about let him take his wings his rainbow take whatever he has and take it back with him the word is God God is the word Give the Lord a sh I pray God first word first hallelujah hallelujah then Paul said again as we said before so now I again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than what you have received let him be a curse you can't bring a new gospel it too late for that it is too late for that we had 40 Years of the ministry of the word and it has not done what it should have done or could have done why God had it to be so I'm going to give a bum the ministry of the word come like the ministry of Moses It could only bring the people up to the promised land Hallelujah some ministers might dispute that with me the ministry of the word was like the ministry of Jesus could only bring them up to Pentecost reing the Holy Ghost but Joshua glory to God Joshua he represent another dispensation another phase from the ministry of the word to the ministry of the spirit so Christ only brought them up to the land but the Holy Ghost have to come down to take them into the land to possess the very land itself oh Hallelujah are you with me now you may be seated so Moses brought them up to the land but then Joshua took them over every place you put your foot is your Moses couldn't do that Moses Ministry couldn't do that but now with the ministry of the spirit you will have the authority you don't have the power because he said go you alter well and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe hallelujah hallelujah wait a minute you may be seated wait a minute are you preaching signs to follow the Believers yes yes I'm preaching s Mark 16 the Lord himself will go with you you going to lay hands on the second and they shall recover you shall cast the demons out you believe that yeah yeah yeah I believe that I am preaching that we going to have that oh Hallelujah that's a sign of the true church Mark 16 in action Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah hallah Galatians two amen this is Paul amen and when Peter was came to Antioch I with stood him to the face because he was to be blamed Peter couldn't say no mistakes were made Paul said he was to be blamed and when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter before them all if thou being a Jew live after the man of the Gentiles and not do as the Jews why compel us the Gentiles to live as the Jews he busted Peter in front of them all Paul was uncompromising it was a life that had to be lived and Peter was living off the balance so Paul had to correct Peter and guess what Peter humbl himself because if a spirit is rebuked or corrected and not humble the word in you would humble because the word is God what if Peter said Paul you can't talk to me like that you should have talk to me privately and besides that I had the key to the kingdom Jesus Jesus told me to speak into day of Pentecost I didn't like that too much you going to call me aside no Paul rebuked Peter in front of them all let me read it again and when Peter was come to Antioch Paul waited for himall Paul was adopted and Peter was adopted these are man of godall not serpent seed and good one and good seed and Bad Seed these a man of God when Peter was coming Antioch I with stod him to the face now these days they don't even want to see your face the shooing behind your back I like to see people eyeball Hallelujah yeah yeah yeah I am a face to face man that's the kind of man I am Hallelujah that's why whatever I say like somebody some Minister want to find out what else but saying when he's not on the pulpit when he's overseas they could hear me and my messages but they want to know what else I'm saying behind the scenes but I don't say behind the scen that I can't see openly all right that's how I always am I would say whatever I say I could say on the on on the platform on the on on on the roof I don't like a time I spoke to a brother here I say if you leave this church every word I spoke to you still stands there was nobody could leave their CH and say um and I and I am saying I should not tell them this I should not tell them that no no no no everything I say I wanted to say I have said and I'm not taking back because I was speaking the truth and I believe in my heart if I cannot tell you the truth I cannot really be faithful to God honest if I can't be honest with you how could I be honest with God I am supposed to tell you the truth I'm supposed to commend myself to your conscience Amen to be fair to be open to be straightforward with you oh hallelujah praise God so when Paul talk with an authority here Paul this is Paul know Paul on a Groove here right now this 1 Corinthians 14 Paul said what came the word of the Lord out of you or came it unto you only Paul Paul saying the questions for them yes yes Paul doing question and answers Paul said what came the word of God out of you or came it unto you only Paul went on and say he the answer if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord that's PA question and answers hallelujah what a man of God oh I love that man Fearless that's what the fire does to you it make you Fearless it doesn't make you intimidated by man I sign up for the word when I went to New York I didn't sign up for politics I sign up for the word I come to this message I sign up not for politics I am not sign for the politics of this church against that church this Minister against that Minister and if that Minister problem with that Minister I suppose a problem too I did not sign up for that I sign up for the word and everybody knows that that I have a certain stand where the word is concerned that I don't buy any ministers fight any Pastor fight any group fight I wouldn't by your fight I told them in India I represent the kingdom of God not Trinidad I told the same thing in New York Hallelujah I represent the kingdom of God they should have known better amen yes sir and after the minut after I preach in New York a storm came and somebody said the devil follow my message oh that sounds good if it look at it that way but if you flip it the other way it could be judgment follow the message and that will be a judgment sign Hallelujah when truth is rejected oh Hallelujah depends upon how you look at it oh my people look at things very strange you know when the church is big and people come to the church they say Revival they come from the east and west north and south when the church small they say a little flock is said father to give me a kingdom to every sword there's a plaster to fit it when God blessing you with natural things and so on they say your land is be before Jordan and their land is after

lead Israel out of Egypt jwm Council never sent Paul out nor did any power or jurisdiction over him God and God Alone did the leading and the ascending and Paul in Galatians 1 said Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead amen oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and Paul had power acts 148 to 10 and there was certain man at listra importent in his feet watch Paul being crippled from his mother's womb amen so this is a no makeup case this is crippled from mother's womb who never had walked there same heard Paul speak who steadfastly beholding him watch and perceive he had fear to be healed said with a l voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked hallu Hallelujah that was Paul in power the gospel being demonstrated in power Hallelujah truly the signs of the apostle was wrought without patience and mighty Deeds isn't that right praise the name of the Lord and then Paul even said I preach the gospel in power and demonstration he the reason that your faith will not rest in the wisdom of man but in the power of God he wanted it not to be resting on the personality of Paul that could bring all these Mighty Revelations but he wanted their faith to rest on the power of God to reveal and to unfold the word so your faith is not on man personality man's ministry that's not what it is your faith have to be in God able to anoint and appoint able to inspire able to speak by direct inspiration Hallelujah that's where your faith after the rest isn't that right oh are you could you take some more all right but brandham he said let me show you another reason why Satan hates This Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not he knows a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he's immutable in his ways meaning unchanging in his nature he's also unchanging in his ways watch watch he knows that since God right does here we go Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action not talking Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be amen watch now remember this Christ in the true church ah is a continuation of the book of Acts now I just shared with you what the book of Acts was like Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal Hallelujah powerless amen it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word write down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand that now here we go he knows the devil knows if the people get a true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army hallelujah hallelujah and that's what we identifying this morning what the churches is and we identifying it by prophecy because this is yet to come because the church must be rebuilt in the power of the spirit the preachers don't want to preach that hallu Hallelujah but Bram said that the message of Grace the church has to be rebuilt in the power of the spirit the church have been built by word but it has to be rebuilt there's going to come some Rebuilders not by might not by power The Headstone coming and The Headstone coming with shoutings not by might not by power but by my spirit so the spirit going to fall and the church going to be rebuilt Oh Glory to God I can see them screaming hallelujah hallelujah the Sheep of God will come screaming out that David Ministry going to come on the same it's going to be Christ in the bride another book of Acts the spirit anointing the bride giving the bride a voice the spirit and the bride when say come the pride will have a Ministry The Pride will have a voice The Pride will become the word the anointing going to strike the prde the bride will take up the book the spirit of God is upon me for he had anointed Me Oh Glory to God there'll be one more ride the world will hear direct from God oh hallelujah hallelujah oh give the Lord a shout the world will yet direct from God glory you will be seated Hallelujah so she so the people this is the people why the people must get a true Revelation because only the people amen will bring a Revival Hallelujah if all these big anointed teachers some of them gurus I know you have one train everybody look up to him a guru all the miss the turban have the people lives in their hands everybody he is the man he have all the F in them all five he's a onean fivefold oh my God so short of men he he just put everything in one man and the people people believe that in all planet Earth God so hand so short he just take one man and put all five inside of him I say hold that I I it blows your mind but what I'm saying is this the people have to get a revelation you see you have to become to know who you are listen without you there's no Revival because the people have to bring Revival if the ministers could have bring it why we don't have it yet oh this is good this is good it can only get better so watch if the people are manhandled if the people are mistreated how could they bring the Revival I know some Churches beat the people in subjection Beat the people in order some people love to be beaten because they can't discipline theel and they hoping somebody disciplined them I remember a brother came from my next Church to church he say he finally not rebuking him I said not rebuking for the wrong things you're doing I said I supposed to rebuke you for the wrong thing you're doing so you you you know your wrong thing you're doing but that's what they want some big stick preacher and I pledged to God when we had 12 people not to rule his people people with rigor with Force I pled to God I even went on an extreme with that leaving them alone and stuff just commit them to God I purpos to God I saw how ministers handle preach people with legalism how they enter their lives who to marry who not to marry to do this and that what car to buy what car not to buy all kind of stuff and I see was wrong just and I pledged that to God and by the grace of God I kept my pledge yeah by the grace of God I kept that pledge because see I see you as God's people I am not the important one you are that's why Jesus died to get you this fold thing is overblown because the five bringing final touches to the bride it'll be the ministry of Christ to edify to build up so I told a brother I said if a 5old minister you get a tape from a 5old minister or you play a message it will edify your church it will build up your church it will strengthen your church it doesn't mean that fightful man in charge of your church it doesn't mean fightful coming to take over your church it have a Ministry is Christ Ministry and they will be speaking the truth in love not just speaking lovely the truth the truth will come out of the inward Parts you see I share this with you I don't know how many you recall but the Joseph kman speaking about he want to get Joseph rainbow coat how many remember that he's looking for Joseph rainbow coat manifestation and so on I want to kind of break that down a little bit if I could do that in that kind of a way you don't wear a quot inside Hallelujah where do you wear code outside what is he saying seven Living Voices Joseph frow code what is he saying I want that on the outside you hear him testify this is what brother brandham had when you come up to brother brandham something sto you about 6t from Brother BR do you do you understand that now in other words that's the token on display Hallelujah that's the voices on display that is not the inside man that is what on the inside is now on the outside how many could shout on that one in other words the people know is Jesus the feeling Jesus The Experience around you Jesus when you talk to them it's Jesus it's Jesus on two feet ah listen to what the prophet said the ministry reach its Perfection when Christ is reproduced in the natural among human beings that has nothing to do with teaching mysteres that have nothing to do with knowledge that have to do with Christ and his love and his life butam got a re of Brotherly kindness he was tested on it two people come making love in church God give him options 1 2 3 you could say if you die they died you say blind they blind and all those were scriptural things somebody got blind under Paul somebody died and as Z fire died under Peter all those things were scriptural it wasn't that God G him unscriptural choices all were scripture and he said none of the above he choose himself to say I forgive you he say why because he did thing wrong too he had that Mercy he had that compassion it was Christ Living out something so so you could see how God going to release his PO sply because he have to do with hearts and men and men desires and lust so if a man have a wrong lust for power to wheel and say I am it I am somebody or my church is somebody God can't release power to that man he got to mess things up like how they messes up over the ages so in this age of maturity Christian maturity when the life is required not so much the meat the teaching the mystery where the life is required Oh Glory to God Hallelujah the Holy Ghost has to report not on teachings on life if it's teachings the sisters will stand a chance because sisters don't teach and there going to be some adopted daughters I'm not hearing them sister but and sisters the sisters in here believe that do you sisters in here believe that they're going to be adopted daughters hallah because some of them Sons get left back behind you know they don't behave themselves because God asking about Behavior behavior is what sets you on adoption your conduct your behavior your attitude your child training your tutorship these are words you're not hearing now but these are the thing you can't say you have arrived that is Guru business that new age business you're one with God my God I am God that's why Stone Jesus you know that is blasphemy if you can't approve it but Jesus could approve it but if you come and say you a God you can prove it it's Stone you know that's blasphemy you can't claim to be the Son of God and you can't prove it but Jesus said to prove that I could do this and I could do that I could do this I could do that I will do this and I will do that so that said that man let's leave him alone oh Hallelujah so let's go then he said if they get a true Revelation here we go of the two Spirits working in the framework of the Christian Church Hallelujah and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before them so if we have to go forward we have to deser and withstand not just discern but withand challenge them challenge false teachings challenge false Doctrine oh hallelujah oh glory to God Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the gates of hell can never Prevail against it amen so somewhere on this Earth there's got got a revelation of the two Spirits working in the framework of the Christian church somewhere on this Earth do you believe that oh blessed be the name of the Lord the two Spirits we want to find out about those two Spirits because there two Spirits oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Glory Glory Give the Lord some praise His people hallelujah so I want to identify the two Spirits here not two teachings right now the two Spirits amen the life that come out your teachings and so on but the two Spirits turn your Bibles to 2 Timothy 3 if you have a mark you can put it to 2 Peter 1 Also let's look at the two spirits in the church now again we not talking about Doctrine we talking about Spirit Hallelujah this is the false spirit this is identify in 2 Timothy 3 reading from verse one this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come here we go for men shall be lovers of their own selves that's number one how about 20 things here that they could see the Spirits by Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despises of those that are good traitors he highminded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women leading with sins LED away with divers lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth I'll stop up there there for now okay let's just go a further now as Janis and jambes withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds verse 8 reprobate concerning the fith but they shall proceed no further for their Folly shall be manifest unto all men all men as theirs also was but thou H has fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith Hallelujah longsuffering and charity and patience a and let's go to Second Peter 1 let's read 4-7 let's see the next spirit and these two Spirits going to be battling all what you just read is church people you know that is not people peating pan smoking marijuana and taking cocaine that is not the drunkards and the one that drinking liquor this is people this is church members Covetous proud love the self all of that having a form of godliness so they still going to church but look at the bright Spirit here now verse four of 2 Peter where I give unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that in the world true lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue unto virtue knowledge unto knowledge Temperance andto Temperance patience andto patience godliness andto godliness brotherly kindness unto brotherly kindness charity that is the other Spirit Hallelujah that you have to actually discern oh praise God now the church what we just read there second Peter 2 Timothy 3 that is the church members amen their ministers is Matthew 24:24 they are ministering to that church and Matthew 24:24 say there shall arise false Christ false prophets that shall show signs and wonders in so much they shall deceive the very elect if possible and second Peter 4 427 is the true church amen that is the true church and their Ministry is found in Ephesians 4 and he gives some Apostles some prophets some teachers some evangelists for the Perfection of the Saints the work of the ministry for theine body of Christ they be all come to un of the faith another Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen now this ministry for the bride is not an eternal Ministry it's until we all come amen until the unity of the faith not the Son of God in other words this is not uh when the people come to that maturity the 5old ministry Ministry is over that's right it's to bring you to a point where you have the unity of the faith n Son of God and to have your measure when you have your measure you need no man teach you but the Holy Ghost will teach you because you have Christ inside of you with the word in your measure isn't that right so therefore the faithful Ministry is not to take over churches manipulate and control churches that is human Unity cannot and must not break sovereignity now I got these words to speak this morning and this is very very important you see because if churches connect to one church after a while if that is not correct and correctly inspired it will bring a denominational spirit in which the sovereignity of the churches are destroyed and people individuals in the in the church begin to disrespect the local Elder because people start to say that church is their church and that Pastor is their pastor and they're getting their own Revelation and that will not be the will of God so when God talk about Unity it doesn't speak about Unity that contact or contradict sovereignity amen God will not have a Unity that breaks sovereignity because brother Bram said the Lord local church is Sovereign elects its own members directs what it has to do elects its own officers anytime some man trying to instruct pastors as to what they should listen to what inspiration they should have that is off the word that is a reintroduction of the nicolan spirit which was a deed in the early age and then become a and eventually it fulfilling a pope because you st you keep getting men over churches and men over areas and men over men until it reached to a hierarchy that you eventually get that Superman ill Papa the pope himself who is over all oh Hallelujah are you with me so therefore it cannot be a message Pope man of the hour pope of the hour Apostle of the hour or some Apostolic succession some man to follow after b as I told MP it do have such vacancy God don't have those application forms for anybody need not apply to take Brother Joseph Coleman Place he had a place in God that's right and he did what he was supposed to do the another book of Acts empowers the local churches to be who they are Hallelujah and what they have been sent to do isn't that right let's go a little further the f is that to please God W the passion to know the word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of the church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal that is what was happening back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to God the dying out and the People weren Too careful about what God Tau of what watch the people weren't too careful about what God taught of them as they begin to be careful about what the world thought of them oh Hal one little deviation from the word was a step away from Christ people say they love God they go to church they shout Rejoice sing have an emotional time but when it's all over watch and see if they in the word walking in it living in it if they go through all the other and didn't walk in that word they say they love God but their lives tell another story keep your mind on the True Church the true church began on the day of Pentecost isn't that right the true church at Ephesus was not deceived by this polish intellectual speeches they wasn't deceived false Revelations that these fellow had called nians which did not cooperate with the word of God false Revelations not with the word but call them Liars they Ephesians now yes sir false Apostles false prophets but the true church held on to the original teaching of St Paul and the baptism of the Holy Ghost which signs following the way of God is Holiness let this be known to every member here in the body of christall until you live a holy life God refuses your sacrifice the sacrifice must be offered with holy hands the high priest before he could come to offer the sacrifice he had to be holy and dedicated and anointed and perfumed everything before he could even walk in the presence of God to offer the sacrifice is that right how can you go out here and cheat and steal and fuss and fight with your neighbors and everything else and carry on way you do and come here and B oh Lord Praise Jesus I see them speak in Tong people say I see them speak in Tong that don't mean they got the Holy Ghost I hear them shout that don't mean they got the Holy Ghost hear these words the Holy Ghost is alive could we give the Lord a praise offering on that one Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is what a life not a teaching a life a life Hallelujah but said the way started the nians watch the Deeds of the nicians began showing themselves then a group formed they drifted away from the pattern of the word just one word changed now the nians not deed as it was back there it become a Doctrine in this age High priests great fellows hadn't called themselves poops yet now they were like archbishops great fellows you know Renown their Doctrine was formal they were getting away from Spirit fill Holy Ghost LED Church they let them go off into minority call them Heretics but the church the real true church wanted to be free under the jurisdiction under the power of the Holy Spirit and Christ had promised to be with them he was their King the true church has never changed his attitude amen not to be ruled by some board I don't know what you call them now they are cardinals Bishops popes in ones that's I'm say right now that they right now Cardinals Bishop Pop's infallible ones and the word infallible means incapable of making mistakes incapable of being wrong oh my god when here we go when that Satan centered group was formed it began to hait and fight the True Believers insisting that they were the Church of God so this is being the church by enforcement and law and if you don't believe cut you off Smite isn't that right notice yeah we go how organization breaths hatred it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness that is what SM that is what m means that is what sman means bitterness a root of bitterness defiles many so more more def was coming as the age feels it instead of the straight word of God instead of spirit filled men in the church who were led by Spirit given Revelation there were now Creeds bylaws educated guesses of educated men could it be could it be could it be and supp is not be educated guesses of educated men learning has taken the place of Revelation reason replace faith and program replace spontaneous PR in the Holy Ghost it had become a hybrid Church oh Hallelujah already the false Vine was turning loose his anger against the Living God by killing the elect you hear that touching the elect you're touching God that's why the pillar of fire tell Saul why thou persecuted me persecuting the church mean persecuting God allmighty Amen Hallelujah watch the true church tried I the true church kept trying to get the first church to repent but it would not do so it increase in size and influence and it Embark upon a constant campaign to discredit the true seed they claim that they alone are the true representative of the Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah now let's be careful here this message to the angel of the church which is in Ephesus is not the message to the actual local Ephesians Church it is a message to the age and that age had in it the seed of truth and the seed of error exactly set forth in the parable of the weat and tears the false Church organized humanized the government and the word and fought the true Christian the third age revealed the spirit of Prophecy that the worldly Church would adopt nism as a Doctrine oh my Hallelujah listen to around the separation of the clergy from the lady group from the biblical truth of Elders Shepherds of local flocks this is it this is the biblical view Elders are Shepherds of local flocks ruling the flock by the world to the Deeds of the neans wherein the clergy set themselves in rank over one another like I went in India there and different pastors telling me that one brother I guess he was the Arch Bishop because somebody giving that brother instruction and this brother seemed to be taking the authority to be over churches and people asking him who who they should marry who they should not marry what they should preach and he controlling I said whoo whoa whoa I said brother I tell those brothers that guy no Arch Bishop over you all forget he your church is Sovereign listen I had 12 people in my church and my brother challenged me and I said that church in cywell is a sovereign church he said with 12 I say yes with 12 amen that's right what if they B to challenge me I B to challenge me right back that group is Sovereign so because we're 12 people we not sing is that right Margaret Tater former prime minister of England she said some powerful words many many years ago in a conference in England and that time Russia was doing bombs and and missiles and so on and she said very ladylike English way she said the weak tempts the strong so we have to get more powerful weapons so they wouldn't be tempted you you you understand what you're saying there when the strong see the weak this be tempted they feeling take over is they're feeling Domin they want to take over so God put rules and regulations by the spirit not to have that am because he knew once they start that it's po get in once they start that kind of thing where this over this and this over this and this over this you end up with a pope and the pope take the crown and he is God on Earth you know how he is you know how he moving he is infallible he is ill Papa and afterwards when they get up there you know they get a new name too change the name and so on so these guys are real imposters impersonators you name it they have it d p you know they have a triple CR you know from better that gold so heavy two men had to hold that Crown to just touch it in his head cuz say the L leg go that CR is break his head he power heaven and purgatory and someplace else that's right man are plenty power man you you you understand I'm saying that that's the pope and that is what a Pentecostal Church fell to be careful I'm not playing oh Hallelujah I saw another angel a horse riding a Pale Horse and death and Hell Followed him who was riding the angel of death amen that kill everyone on the Earth First with false dine false teaching after brother Ram died so much of false teachers come out riding riding riding until them seven Thunders TR out their voices 1974 a real Revelation that give focus and vision as to what we have to go under to them and P rewards I could preach rewards but how do you get a reward reward reward is the him that overcome it if it don't overcome no reward for you a so it's good to preach rewards the Muslims preaching rewards Isis preaching rewards how much virgins they will get when they go on the other side that's right and how much they going to get in paradise and them guys dying to go to paradise that's right so they blowing up theel killing theel they're going and fight they fighting to D they nothing to lose you that's right think about it they have nothing to lose you tell people what reward here now they can overcome it I give to be a pillar in the house of God you pressing for that pillar you have to press towards to overcome and if you can overcome the little trial is coming right now look a nurse come back from some one of the states with theola and the isolator in in New Jersey somewhere there she's uncomfortable she don't like it 21 days I wouldn't want her for me but guess what is men had feeling for fear the things that are come on the earth people start to panic already ebola ebola ebola oh Hallelujah brother about ger Warfare is disease coming it's coming he said before he stri stri to enter the kingdom of God but here what John said what the Bible said the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressed the way into it so if the preachers if the ministers Don't Preach the kingdom how will the People Press then you can't afford to hear an uncertain song you've got to hear a certain song Because if the trumpet uncertain song who going to prepare for the battle glory to God look across this message they have the books they have the tapes they could get things some brandom Tabernacle they have all of that they have the mess but where is the power which church is groaning which church is travailing which church is crying out oh Lord send the power just now and some Minister rais up with a false teaching the bride is the thir third person of the Trinity and the Bride of the spirit numbing the people with debt injecting them with debt so they don't have to have no desire right now they go on the G level cuz I new AG teaching one with God and and you meditate and you're one with God you are God you are God you have scripture for that too Hindus using it gurus using it too you are God stripped off the desire for the Holy Ghost blessed that day that hunger and to after righteousness blessed that day that hunger and thirst after righteous all these years I ain't come to be natural I supposed to be dying out more coming like Christ not more natural fighting up with the flesh fighting up with the world Jesus overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life before he even went out for the ministry the B is Jordan friends who's going to cross who's going to Cross Jordan who's going to really die out the battle is Jordan and Jordan is dead hallelu brother brandham I'm not finished yet I know it's that kind of lengthy message a teaching message but my God this is the word and you have to know these things you have to know you're not alone you have to know we are on the word we have to know amen the two Spirits that's working and how you can understand what you're battling and fighting Hallelujah you're fighting for Faith and virtue this is the land this is the land here that rainbow to be inside of you that rain listen the de Angels when I see the blood he can't see it on the inside it has to come on the outside the blood was seen that blood that token is the spirit the life have to come on the outside what's on the inside have to be manifest in other words you could say you a Christian but until you manifest your Christianity you're still saying you are a Christian the life have to come out and thunder then it becomes a live voice and that's the Thunder that shakes the devil voice has to live how many have to live how many believe the word must live in them how many understand coming to church doesn't make you a Christian Glory I feel your desire growing for a manifestation in your life you've got to have a desire to see the word manifested because you must be the word manifested to be the bride see that brother Bram said when the Holy Ghost fell in the upper room and the people said to carry on the devil turn over and back and sleep he said they excited that's right they're making noise they shouting they're screaming they acting like drunk men devil say I sleeping on that one call me when something serious happen but when the word start to ooze out to Peter when Peter went to the gate called beautiful and that man was there and he said Silver and Gold Have I None such as have I give unto you rise up and walk devil say this is serious this is serious this is word manifested now they're not excited no more this we have to stop this we have to arrest this must not continue but they are go we now getting started we are now about to write another book of Acts oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah we now about to write another book of Acts amen Hallelujah Glory sad to say you may be seated the True Vine was not exactly immune from this Doctrine but as I do not mean that the True Vine did establish nican idas as a Doctrine fa but a little worm of debt kept sucking at the True Vine hoping it might fall even within the true church men whom God had called as offers were holding that title to mean a little more than local responsibility this is when a man feel he's in charge of Africa charge of South America charge of Europe charge of here and there and he figure he could call up pastors and tell them this and tell them that he believe in other words he make himself a pope yes and they don't want to go out of line because the people are asking we want to be connected to this or we want that and want that so if the pastor take up the authority the people will Rebel and with the connection it have now where people could be connected to this and that the other people could stay home they could do what they want and people undermining churches and whatnot all of that now is a new age a new dimension of things but that is not the principle that is laid down in the Bible that's not a principle that is in the Bible with Paul so I want to tell the pastors even out there who may hear this message don't let no man tell you what to preach what inspiration you supposed to have don't let that happen at all to take control of your churches that is unscriptural because at the end of it all God will hold that man accountable for the flock that God plac In His Hands God will never ask another Minister about you God will ask me you responsibility of you in my hands so that is why I have to preach what I have to preach say what I have to say because at the end of the day I have to give an account and the kind of person I am I don't like excuses that's why I say if you feel it I have fail I'm supposed to provide leadership I'm supposed to present the word to you that we can make it is is not right all right let me see B wrap up here wo my God hallelujah it was not clear understanding of Paul that existed at his time watch watch and they glorified god in me no matter what Authority Paul had listen to this he kept the people looking to God from whom is all authority but the clergy watch was always looking to Divine leadership plus human and thus in giving honor where honor was not you we find the true church was spotted with humanism with nism establish Apostolic succession placed ministers pastors voted in it was only one step for the faler to proceed to bism the Second Step was to be the death of Satan so first a deed then a Doctrine then it go to all this Apostolic succession then go to B bism then it go to the depth of Satan oh Hallelujah he said this age started off in the first of 20th century this age here it was the age in which the true church would return being the bride like she was at Pentecost we know that there must have necessity to be a return of dynamic power the Believers sense this in their Spirits here we go and they begin to cry to God for a new outpouring as it was in the first century listen to this what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long waited restoration he's talking about 1906 he's talking about the hungering and Theo of the spirit at the early age watch it was not for the lattering can only come after the former Reign which is the spring or teaching rign so for all these 40 plus years it has been a teaching rain to forerun the for the latter rain because the latter rain this inspiration reain to bring and make manifest what has been taught now you cannot change the seed in midterm whatever the seed is it going to come forth youve got to have the right seed because the rain only manifest what the seed is the rain doesn't change the seed the rain only manifests the seed and if we plant the perfect man it going to manifest the perfect man and that is the seed that was Ed second Peter 1 427 that's the seed in you that's the word in the bride that's the word in the bride that's the pyramid in you that's the Bible in you oh give the Lord a shout of Praise oh hallelujah hallu hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated I know we little lty but I've got to go right now got to continue right now now watch the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the heart of the children back to the Pentecost had not yet come thus what was T to be the restoration and final quickening unto the Rapture love that had not yet come it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost in it was the devil power as men were under the control of devils this is church realm yet no one seemed to realize it to prove it was not the real thing when the second generation appeared organized and wrote the unscriptural doctrine and build their own fences as every other group ahead of them did so fences organization is a confirmation that it is off because the spirit cannot be organized because you can't box in God you can't fence god with a Doctrine and a teaching he would sneak out he would walk out Hallelujah God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth oh Hallelujah Glory listen to this what we have set forth is much easier to be understood if all believe the doctrine of the Wess of the godhead for there are not three persons in the godhead but one thus we are not born again by the spirit of life of Jesus coming in and then subsequent to that the holy spirit comeing in to give us power if that is true why are we dishonoring the father by not giving him part in our complete salvation he said if salvation is of the lord and there are three Lords then he father must have something to do too but surely it can be seen that Jesus made this very clear that it was he and he alone who is God and he alone who is coming into the believer s John 14:16 says that the father will send another comforter this is Brother Bram interpreting the scriptures SN 14 says 16 the father was a comforter but in verse 17 Jesus said he dwelleth with them and should be in them later amen yes Amen in verse 18 he says he will come to them in verse 23 he is speaking he said we father and son will come into him thus it is the father Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at what time all coming in at one time it's one person a man preach and say father son something missing who missing and man the bride missing father son and man father son and man man make up the godhead therefore man is God therefore the bride is God so father son miss out the spirit so therefore the bride is the spirit that is a real piece of intellectual reason there a a piece of high science that that real high that too high for me this year is very simple for me this is very simple father son Holy Ghost all coming in one time for it is one person comprising the godhead it don't have bride the third part of the Trinity what Trinity they talking about that's foolishness Hallelujah that's just corrupt Doctrine oh blessed be the name of the Lord that advent took place at at Pentecost there aren't two comings of his Spirit just one the trouble is that people don't know the real truth oh blessed be the name of the Lord here we go almost in the home stretch now praise God hallelujah we go The Seven Ages are set forth by Revelation chap 2 and 3 take in the whole span of the fullness of the Gentiles or the whole time in which God is dealing with the Gentiles and the Salvation in every single age by none it says the very same thing in opening and closing in the message of each age unto the messenger of smna titra Philadelphia laia right these things say he he a let him here what the spirit said in the churches notice here that Jesus by the spirit amen in every age Hallelujah addresses himself to only one person relative to the word of that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church amen he speaks here we go he's a messenger to what true church say true church true church he's a messenger of the what true church all right now here we go he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false so even though the prophet is a messenger to the true church he speaks to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all here we go but though it is broadcast for all who come within the range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way so they don't receive it just ordinary this message is received by a certain group this has to be the same group on page three or four wait till them seven Thunders UT the voices to that group who receive what who receive the message in a certain way oh are you ready this is good how many enjoying the word this morning Hallelujah here we go let's describe the individuals in that group because that's not a church that's not a place that's groups that's individual around the world listen to this each individual of that group are you ready yes everybody ready you ready sure you're ready all right each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger not by some Pastor the messenger have to say it here we go those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation all right nor or is the group getting a collective Revelation and that's what we have had groups getting Collective Revelation when one man say something everybody else parot the same thing yes yes so when things get messed up the whole group get messed up when things Falls the whole group Falls no genuine Revelation I told a minister he didn't hear from God when he preaching one of the conventions I said God didn't speak to you I told him that direct I said you did not hear from God because you wasn't speaking for God or by God you were backing up things that was false you see you see that brother over yes I said many other things too Hallelujah but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God that is why brother Bram said the messenger the prophet and the bride says the same thing the spirit the prophet and the bride says the same thing he said he will confounder by the prophet and the bride yes amen the conf is to confus to mess with their minds they can't even understand how the bride could move on the moving he will confounder confuse them oh Hallelujah Paul alone had the full Revelation and this is evidenced by his confrontation of the other apostles who admitted that Paul was a prophet messenger also note by actual illustration in the word when Paul desired to go to Asia God forbade him for the Sheep his children were in Macedonia and Macedonia would hear what the spirit have to say and in what Paul while Asia would not in every age exactly the same pattern mus come on please I think I'll close up here there's not def finish in the message actually this was a long message I have 19 pages I reached 13 so we we can get in close so in every age we have the same pattern that that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken Hallelujah remember Paul wared the people only what he said If any man think himself to be a prophet of spiritual let him ack knowledge of the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord isn't that right how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has one voice which is the voice of God the spirit only has one voice which is the voice of God which is the voice of the word hallelujah so anything off the word is not the spirit speaking isn't that right so Paul warned them to say what he said even as Peter did likewise he warned them that even he Paul couldn't change one word of what he have given by Revelation every messenger of every age will preach the word every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word of God hallelujah The Cry of every age is a rebuke you have left the word of God repent come back to the word from the first book of Genesis to the last book of Revelation there's only one reason for God's displeasure leaving the word there's only one remedy get back back on the word oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God 2 Peter 2:12 and there were false prophets among them even as there will be false teachers among you who prively shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that brought them and bring upon themselves F destruction isn't that right second Timothy 4 3 to 4 for the time will come they will not endure song Doctrine but after their own lust shall have Heap teachers Hallelujah and themselves teachers having itching ears and shall turn from truth unto fables oh praise God 1 Timothy 4:1 for the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the Fate giv heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils oh hallelujah oh it's a terrible time we living in we have to have discernment to discern the two Spirits working in the framework of the church now in every case you will notice that the false prophet is one who is outside the word and we showed you what the Antichrist means anti- word so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends have you noticed how the people who lead others astray bind closely to themselves by fear I want to repeat that have you noticed how people who lead others astray buying people closely to themselves by fear they say if the people don't do what they say destruction will follow they are false prophets for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ oh give the Lord a shout of Praise he will not tell the people to fear Him or what says but to fear what the word says oh give the Lord a praise offering oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God Amen Hallelujah here is prophecy I believe one of these glorious days when this United confir of churches goes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to prophecy then there will form an image unto the Beast and I tell you the True Church of God will be drove together and the True Believers out of Methodist Baptist Presbyterian whatever will go together cemented by the love of God that will make up the body of Jesus Christ oh hallelujah oh glory to God this is Yet to Come Oh Hallelujah prophecies the wheel are beginning to turn oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah praise God but Bram that in the last days these seven voices will be made known to the real true church can you see where the false and the counterfeit is trying to keep great men from places like that oh Hallelujah as Daniel heard the seven Thunders and was forbidden to write John heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with Seven Seals but in the days of these seals to be open the mystery of God will be finished in other words God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God would be revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seven Mysteries would open to the church because in there the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's the seven T the manifestation oh Hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God brother brandom here what I'm saying to you that in the last days the true bride church will come to The Headstone will be a super church will be a super race as the near the great headstone there will be so much like him they will be the very image in order to be United with him there will be one there will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denomination can never produce this oh Hallelujah Oh Glory The Word of Promise be seated is himself like was in Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise to fulfill what is written of him here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has do he the Lord oh hallelujah or she going to keep still oh hallelujah oh glory to God there's got to be a Ministry in the church in the True Church of the Living God so when The Headstone Comes The Headstone is coming or the ministry of Christ Christ will fit in perfectly and bring back the redeemed Hallelujah the complete Ministry of Christ will be restored the fullness of the Holy Spirit oh hallelujah praise God now this last step must come to Perfection that the holy Spirit has to live in the church not more Mysteries not more more teachings we have 40 plus years of the ministry of the word there's a prophecy laying here that the Holy Spirit have to live in the church we have to see the manifestation of the Holy Spirit living in the church living among the people with signs with wonders with Miracles another book of Acts act 16 in action the Lord himself going everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following glory to God glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Give the Lord a shout we almost there oh hallelujah praise God you may be seated Lord I want to finish this here now Hallelujah you know Daniel saw a stone cut out without the hands of man is that right but said the gentle dispensation ends with the coming of that stone that stone that rock that dynamics that coming to end the Gentile dispensation here people don't know when Moses come walking down to Pharaoh Moses had a two-fold me message he me Deliverance to Israel judgment to Pharaoh when the Rain Begin to Fall in Noah's day had a twf purpose to float the ark and judge the world it's restoration and judgment and when the Bride come down walking in the spirit of the pride is a twofold purpose to bring a jubilee to bring a deliver and to bring judgment to declare the day of Vengeance of our God church this is the word this is the word this is the message I'm almost done listen to this brother brandham Christ is that stone he wasn't born of a man he was born of God he is coming for a church that's been reborn by the spirit of God cause the strength of that headstone runs through the church like a magnet here we go I remember being in watching a mill they were shaping out all them things scrap laying all about and a big Stone come a big magnet Stone and pick it up all that was magnetized to it we have got to be magnetized to The Headstone and The Headstone is the Holy Ghost not the bride is the Holy Ghost because the headstone is the Holy Ghost the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost oh God we are promised The Headstone we have promised the Holy Ghost we have promised the Dynamics are you looking for it are you expecting it oh Hallelujah I'm going to close with this the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite the body and when the head and but unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up the Dynamics is the holy spirit so how the bride could be Dynamics it doesn't make sense oh
