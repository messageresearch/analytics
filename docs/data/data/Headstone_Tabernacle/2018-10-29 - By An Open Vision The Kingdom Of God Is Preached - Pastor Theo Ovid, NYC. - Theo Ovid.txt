========================================

god bless you good evening if we may stand up as we start our service tonight are you happy to hear this tonight let us take our Bible just before we start I'd like us to the read through in the book of John the seventeenth chapter and I'd like you to take a time here to read the prayer that Jesus did for you and me tonight this phrase as effect is as effective as it was when Jesus prayed it a Menem and it's in John chapter seven seventeenth sorry and starting from the first verse and Jesus praying say this father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he shall give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him and this is life eternal that they made that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on earth on the earth I have finished the work which thou givest me to do and now Oh father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world then they were and thou givest them me and they have kept thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me ah of thee for I have given unto them the words which thou givest me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for their vine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name for those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are while I was with with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou givest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of prediction that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world sanctify them through the truth today truth thy Word is truth as thou hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified to the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which are which shall believe on me through the world that's for you and me that they may all that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I in them and thou in me that they may be one that that may be perfect that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that I has sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me father I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loved me before the foundation of the world all righteous father the world hath not known in thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and we declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them amen this is Freddie's prayer tonight is so fitting for us as we are gathered here coming from all places different races and different background and we believe that God is here

amana whoops wires dark on every and and we can all understand all the way that God will lead us to that blessed promised land oh and we follow till we die we will understand it better by and by and by by morning when the saints of God I got at home we with the story Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] we are Fanta and dreaming on the Restless sea of time somebody I said howdy tempest-tossed exceeded my son shot in that and of perfectly random 'support away we will understand it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah how many are happy Holi David said I was glad when they said unto me just a statement when they said unto me it made him happy amen amen how much more happy is when we are in the house amen amen I told the story one time how we had gone to service rather to eat after a service and we were approaching the restaurant and next to the restaurant there was some kind of sports restaurant and there was a game going on and I guess it was a well that was drinking there and so forth then we were just next door to a quiet place but next to a very rowdy and you know I was thinking you know we're having a nice quiet dinner here and what if I went over on the other side and said you know hey you're acting too happy or whatever just calm down are you kidding me I probably wouldn't be here tonight to be speaking to you tonight you know why because they were in their place in their element in their spirit but this is our place we're in the spirit on the Lord's Day amen and nobody should feel funny amen about worshiping the Lord Jesus purpose we here for I'm a man god bless you I want to sing a song that we sing here and I think we've sung it around and in the field it's the life behind the name because that uh now I want to try that you turn around and shake somebody's hand but just make sure you keep your seats hey man because it is karate tonight and but it's the life amen I believe that that's a revelation amen because it's not so much teaching it's not so much how well we can expound on the word and unless the life is in the believer amen our living is in vain that's right so I like this song very much because the devil doesn't like it I like it it's a life behind the name oh it's the life behind a name that makes the turnaround and greet some of I be her that makes up our humble it was God who devised a plan that it all he could live give us the life behind the name yes the light behind the name [Music] it's a life behind the name that makes up [Applause] and all things as a man [Music] hey Angie [Music] [Music] [Applause] like behind the name that makes the demons tremble Maui is behind the name [Music] it [Music] [Applause] [Applause] the preachers time I want to get the preacher up to the platform just as quickly as we can I believe tonight we're first of all I want to welcome you all to the original faith the gospel tabernacle and some of you who are here for the first time well this is where we worship the Lord and we're we're so blessed I mean we are so blessed and we have seen God do wonderful things among us and deal with his people in a very personal way and we have learned to always count our blessings and sometimes that we forget to thank God about the little things there's so many things that God has done for you today actually and you forgot to thank him for because he's always doing things for us amen and so we are always indebted to him so this is why when we get together like this there's no reason why we just cannot fully express how we feel welcome those that are online I understand there are quite a few online brother Theo Ovid is well a world traveler he has many friends and in Africa and throughout they're listening in and I'm sure locally throughout America I just trust and pray that our streaming service will be enough we are we're going to try to change it soon - I guess YouTube I think they have a much broader bandwidth to be able to handle the load so but anyway we're glad to be here and you know I am so thankful that you know today if we were to listen to the weather forecasts we probably wouldn't be here today and they're trained men they looking at their radars and looking at you know and I had invited you know brothers you know and to come and and one of the brothers said you know there's gonna be a nor'easter that's coming your way and I say well that's beyond my ability to control that we're having a meeting that's for sure so that's that's all I know so amen so what happened to the nor'easter you see the devil had a plan and God had a plan that's right and I'm gonna tell you something God's plan always with amen probably because if God is with us who can be against us amen amen so tonight I do not want to delay any further our precious brother I have known him for over nearly 30 years we've traveled together around the world when we were young and I took him out to eat yesterday we were just talking and reminiscing about our our age you see we we stand behind a pulpit and come out like a roaring lion and we wake up with assistance in the morning your back is hurting everything else and you know just to show you you're not getting any younger but one thing under the anointing and inspiration of the Holy Spirit amen he gives us the strength to go on a man and brother Theo was telling me such a I mean I I laugh because it was so humorous that if you ever want to know honestly something straight ask a child ask her grand son granddaughter because he was telling me how his grand child told grandpa you know I'm young you know they'll tell you whether you have of something on your head or something I'll tell you what is that you know so I like the I like how that is you know so but anyway they have nothing to really you know that's just a sincerity of their heart so God richly bless you I believe with all my heart that the time is late meaning not late tonight but late in season and we realize when we think that the world our United States cannot get any crazier than what it has been we hear the news of today the world is going insane brother Graham said the world will end up insane what does that mean that means when you can no longer discern when right becomes wrong and wrong becomes right your insight and the world is headed in that direction you know I talk about fake news and so forth or whatever you don't even know what to believe thank god this is why I this is this is my news right here amen long after this world is gone this work this this word will stand forever heaven and earth will pass away but this word will never pass away and this is where I stand tonight just before brother overcomes I just wanted to just read one quote and then I will have our precious brother come because we realized that this is a unity meeting tonight and I appreciate each and every one I I for the sake of time I'm not going to try to name everyone but they've come from probably if we have some time we'll do that we'll do it tomorrow but we'll save some time tonight what we want to tell you welcome warm welcome New York welcome I know that New Yorkers are are considered well rule that's the nature of a New Yorker but when you're born again amen you take on another nature amen amen and we are brothers and sisters no matter what it is that we we may disagree but at the end of the day what I have found out truly after all this time that love and your attitude you see brothers and sisters disagree flesh brothers and sisters disagree but they cannot deny the fact that they are brothers and sisters yes you see and so much more us we may disagree on this and that but it doesn't mean that we should just start start killing each other you see but there's gonna be a unity of the faith I think that with all my heart and everybody you know goes around today in trying their best because I what I like about brother yo but I don't I've never seen he's had any kind of agenda any secret agenda you know we have people that go around oh this experience happened to me and and this and that and and people just follow that experience and follow the person who is speaking about that experience but we realize that every experience that we you and I have passed to match up with the word amen amen because at the end of the day it is the word that's right I'm in our experience you see and brother Branham said about Paul when he was when he met the pillar fire so Paul goes down there first to see if his experience matched God's Bible see after he experienced the pillar fire he wanted to make sure that it matched God's Bible Oh wouldn't it be wonderful today if people only done that again if we made our experience match God's Bible if it doesn't then our experience is wrong I mean simple as that but you don't know how it felt so your experience is wrong it is off door amen amen enjoy the feeling but it's wrong that's right you see it doesn't flash in the urine thumbing you see and what is a urine thumbin it's the work it's the message of this hour and this is why people just going little have going this way and just can you know lost turned around and they refuse to turn around meanwhile then the navigational systems on them you know the turn around turn around make up you may go back well if you know more than a tional system then go ahead but I'm I'm trusting in this navigational system here amen it will never mislead us see amen the urine thumbin and if it flashes see there Amen we got it but if it doesn't I don't care how good it is it seems how real it looks like it was right if those lights don't flash on that Hyrum Thummim it was wrong any matter how much experience you've had how real it seemed to be how presenting it is how educational it is see what a good what a great tool it is to win souls if it doesn't flesh in the word see it's wrong right see it must line up with the word and I'm so thankful that the bride is lining up the Word of God and that's what these this meeting is all about and one last quote because I was reading this some time ago and it just kind of struck me because I feel this is appropriate for tonight and then oh god perfecting his church now this is in Binghamton New York listen this is a personal New York you need a shake in here I say amen to that hey man oh we had chickens sure we need more shakes right we need we need to be shaken and shaken and take shaking until we shake right into the word and God will and his purpose in our lives in New York I like that you need a shake in here I haven't got the ability as a minister to do to do it as a preacher I know I'm a spare tire but my heavenly father see he's big enough to do it and I trust it to him that he'll do it and I love you and I maybe if I am inker if my incorrect way of demonstrating myself or giving out to the way I feel maybe it isn't it's it's insufficient or it isn't influencing you're educated and smart people this is why I say is like what's your education and your smartness because it's just a stumbling block to the spirit see but I know what I'm talking about the Prophet I like this he said I know what I'm talking about he often said I may not know the Bible real well but I know the author and that's the most important thing we can see but I know what I'm talking about I know the love of God I know the power of God and I know that he is and maybe he will manifest himself in a divine gift may the Lord bless you and I say well New York we need a shakin because brother Brown said that the United States we send out the most missionaries around the world and quite frankly we need them the most so I am so happy to receive brother Ovid I love him with all my heart and he is a person that walks alone when you walk with God you're gonna have to walk alone many people are not gonna understand you when I say alone I'm saying not necessarily alone but not with a great great fanfare and a great host of people and so forth you've got to spend on your conviction and you will not have many people that will understand you but now will the pressures of the outside world make you change and if it does you're not called to to stand for this work you're not and so therefore I'm I am proud and I am so blessed to have our precious brother Theo Ovid he's very busy and he took this time to step to New York and to be with us I think he's going to another part of Africa then South Africa after this I don't know how he does it amen but god bless him and we're under expectation amen how many are under expectation I believe that God can do playing a man whatever your needs may be whatever god I told her the over to just have your Liberty whatever it is that the Lord laid upon your heart we are message believers we believe this message amen and people want to say what do you believe I believe this message yeah that's as simple as that so but anyway soon and very soon we're going to see the king do you believe that I snap to our I receive our precious brother soon and very soon we are going to see [Music] [Music] don't cry in there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] pray Heavenly Father we appreciate your love towards us that give us the opportunity the truth at Calvary and through the will of Jesus we could meet each other and our fellowship outside your blood where would they be tonight outside the cross outside paying that price that make us have fellowship one another Lord we are so grateful and thankful for your mercy that you have given us an opportunity to share the gospel and share the world now Lord come and take me out of the way cut out what a gift is to get out of the way and let the pillow fight over my shoulder and speak live to hear to your people tonight made a second on me to be healed many bond be set free those connected on the internet mayor sent our rushing mighty wind bless them and heal them we need a revival father and you promised it and we expecting it in Jesus and we ask it be many may God bless you for your Bibles I like it a turn to Phil Samuel Chapter three wanna read verse one wanna read Matthew chapter 24 verse 11 to 14 they also want to read Luke 16 150 over 60 so first samuel chapter tree first was we want to read and the child samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the words of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open vision next scripture is Matthew chapter 24 we learn from verse 11 the fourteenth a many false prophets shall arise and deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cool but he did endure unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come the last scripture familiar scripture Luke 16 verse 16 the law and the prophets 1 till John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man press it into it may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise God thank you Lord Jesus god bless you saints believers brothers we take it approval egde because we don't know what's gonna happen next week you don't know one off the next year you don't even know the next month we know that America is sitting on the prophecy blues Angelis is on the prophecy yes your life also is on the prophecy Jerusalem is on the prophecy room is on the prophecy even God has to use his word to bring his things to pass so when the prophecy is spoken it hangs there until the time appointed so tonight I have a title by an open vision the kingdom of God is preached it's the title tonight my open vision the kingdom of God is preached I have a subject the kingdom is not in word but in power and Ivan inspirations try even to end and be positionally pleased image striving to enter in and be positionally please now of a context scripture and this on st. mark 114 now after that John was put in prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God seeing the time is fulfilled the kingdom of God is at hand repent II believe the gospel another scripture John 18 then Pilate entered the judgment hall again and called Jesus and said that dog the king of the jews and jesus answered him saying says doubt this of thyself or did others tell thee of me Pilate and said am I a Jew that or nation and chief priests of deliver thee unto me what has thou done jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world we are not talking about church we are talking about a kingdom he said my kingdom not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight and I would be not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence the amplified of that is Jesus were saying my kingdom or kingship or royal power belongs not in this world if my kingdom were of this world my followers would have been fighting to keep me from being handed over the Jews but my kingdom is not from here it has no such original source I like that it has not arisen for source our kingdom is not from here so therefore we are not limited by no Easter

said the world will bow at the feet of men and women across Jordan is somebody gonna cross Jordan today somebody gonna cross over hallelujah I know what Jordan today is brotherly kindness what Jordan

that's what people have done God amen hallelujah glory to God sir before you truly break into the land of the Holy Spirit you have to be blessed into that spirit of forgiveness spirit of not just I

brotherly kindness an open vision will praise God hallelujah breeze goes to this open vision give you an understanding that you have to die that you have to Jordan without excuses without blaming others people people like to justify their position I am NOT going there because I am NOT fellowshiping with this brother because we don't believe the same thing that's a lie you are warmed up you are messed up because they say the Bible said if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves but if we confess our sins he is willing and justifications and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness or glory not gonna we'll be under the blood of Jesus that we have fellowship one with another because the same blood for you is for me is not just one blood and that's blood is for you alone it's what we also say if God forgive you he could forgive me and if God forgives me he can forgive you and if that could brother yes cleanses us I'll be our fellowship one with another so we have a right to fellowship oh yeah we can disagree on this and disagree on that but we cannot fellowship it's too much too much land to be taken you're gonna find about that tomorrow oh please God mr. Maulana oh praise God so by the bottom right description we went tonight from Samuel and so we'll talk about the wood of Louis precious in those days and there was no open vision Eli a priest getting dim-sighted I'm not seeing what he's supposed to see I'm gonna to find this young man and call him out and give him a vision and a vision an open vision is the tyreq word of the Lord see that makes a difference the humming horn you're sleepy at this at that ball but sudden attack would come to you if your vision shaken up right you have a purpose no you have an intent no you have a vision no you have a desire no you have something that needs to be accomplished because gonna spoon to your heart so far I'm saying what is the vision that is the tyreq word of the Lord O Lord our God was precious in those days so hear him is very outstanding when we realized we are speaking from the scriptures it said there was no provision in those days of Samuel where there is no vision the people perish we must have a vision must you're the seed when churches have a vision when countries have a vision when President and Prime is a vision you see in the country in the churches when a family of a vision when a husband of a vision you see the effect of that the coefficient gives a sense of direction we must have a vision and vision comes to the prophets and it's the word of the Lord spoken to them so if we speak according to what the prophets said we are speaking a vision you're speaking division because God will only walk to the vision when God's of wind shall conceive he means that the comma bring a different interpretation that's what he said a virgin shall conceive and when he said that the transformation laugh is Mary will glory the course of the Scriptures is one thing you can get lost in translation he'll be transmitted right the voice of one kind of illness that's the word when God translate that has John the Baptist behold I send you Elijah that's the word translate that that's written bran and he shall turn the handsome return back to the faith of the Father that's the word that's you the children whose return literally back to the fate of the fathers the Amen praise God said whatever I said ah we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour he promises to be can rest assure he would keep his promise and that's the confidence that the believer has in his makeup he promised to meet the need and one reason that the church is in the condition it is in because there are so many voices so many other voices that track the church from the voice of God that is very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God do it spoke in your midst and perhaps never even understand it because it God Himself centered on the voices of the day and we noticed there are so many voices and if God promised he would give us that if other voices are contrary to the voice of God then it must be the voice of our enemy to confuse us and we would not understand the voice of God when it's book because when you confuse the counterfeit your mind still because you're confused you see faith is solid faith is revealed it is our rock you can't be confused that's why the Bible said right to vision and make it clean let's heat up really run because the vision has to bring clarity the quality of the vision oh and that's a noisy because this is it now what Jesus did to those guys walk with them they work with them to talk disciples they understood they did not understand because it was withholding from them so when Jesus resurrection ministry came he brings a bring clarity to the scriptures of the Old Testament he opened the word and openly understand it so now they have a vision they have clarity then he released them the promise out of that vision behold I send the promise of my father upon you timeliness it in Jerusalem until we do and perform on high so now they know and in his spirit now he's leaving with them he's a bad eye he's gone and they're not frustrated and not be pressed in the atmosphere why because a vision a revelation the the expectation every Silvester greetin atmosphere because they're looking for the power that is promised go on and bring you all forgive you nothing gonna get bring you over here books and tips and you're reading reading every day reading listening calling pinyon for that he bring you all to come into a manifestation the word was the word but the word became flesh the word was invisible until it became flesh when the word became flesh then it become visible so what want to be visible in you tonight they say there's so much boy says it get ins the voice of the supernatural get ins the voice of the supernatural this great mighty men or intellectual I'm entered in the intellectual conditions even sheep nation nations they are not overnight people but the sick nations and a person will be a bit confused there's so much voices but the voice of God how will we know is the voice of God question how would we know because it was then in the vinegar that prophet anybody knew brother Branham was the voice of God that's easy you could read and see the test somebody's a manifestation but how would you know other day how do we know is the voice of God because it would be a manifestation of the prophets would so what you after here is this is that that the Prophet will the madam Speaker that is how you know it's the voice of God it will be a manifestation of the prophets word and watch the true voice of God brings back that real living supernatural manifestation of the true Word of God okay hallelujah so we read the scripture mark 1:15 the time is fulfilled jesus said and the kingdom of God is at hand repent and believe the gospel Matthew 24:14 and the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world as a witness and then all nations and then shall the end come and we know that the gospel is not a word only but in power and demonstration of the custom or glory that got the gospel of the kingdom I want to talk a little bit about the kingdom kingdom has a king and that King owns everything including the people themselves in a kingdom the people are called subjects or citizens that's why he Ephesians to Stella's we are therefore no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the scenes and the hopes of God amen the people are subjects they don't vote the king in a hoot amount it is not a democracy it is not the people's choice the King owns everything and the definition of subject is a person who is under the Dominion or rule of a sovereign king and when you live in a kingdom you are under the rule of the king glory to God hallelujah leader so the Bible's about the king and the kingdom and his royal children I could hit a shot on that one not just the king not just the kingdom but his royal children isn't that right hallelujah so no you could understand his horror that Samuel God and he reacted when the King know you can understand sound of reaction from you as good as your king why are you asking for a king give the Lord a shout and God dropped them and said Samuel they have not rejected you rejected me well Chloe look or because they want a man King they want human they want Oh glory that God must be your king I'm a king of a domain the government is the territory and that's what make it a kingdom a kingdom is the governing impac of a king will over territory Kingdom must have a king a king is sovereignty is absolute hallelujah so the Ten Commandments moody says so let it be written it's fear so let it be done that's what their fellows talking when the right that's it the can change the laws they're absolute Oh glory to God our King laws is absolute Oh My so the word Dominion refers to the Kings Authority his domain refers to his territory all kingdoms have few things a king a territory a constitution which is a royal covenant sisindri subjects laws privileges code of ethics army economic security and social culture and protocols all Kingdom have that just want to strike two things territory sounds 24:1 deal it is the Lord and the fullness thereof the world and all that dwell therein isn't that right the Constitution the Bible is the confusion of this kingdom or glory record isn't that right but the system series the people that live under the rule of the king or this is the background on this channel under citizenship is a kingdom it's not a right but the privilege the benefits and privileges of the kingdom only when you access rights to all what the citizen gets Oh hallelujah so case dear but you have access it Cillian is there deliverance is there rituals dear revival as dear but you are accessing and you accessing it as a citizen of God's kingdom and the king is obligated to care for and protect and their one fear because is a reflection of the king himself so that's why the King cuz I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll be with you even in you know glowing cast your cares upon and he cares for years go glory to God and the privileges of benefits that the King put on his faithful citizens so once you are in a kingdom you are personally here is personally responsible for you and your needs that's why the Bible says seek first the kingdom of God and all other things shall be added unto you because once you are in the kingdom he's responsible for your need so don't ever take your troubling God knock on heaven's door you need a healin nothing heaven store financially - nothing eventhough you need a revival you need something at Perkin in your soul Oh glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus please God amen hallelujah so this kingdom concept oh god some you so therefore okay so okay so like in the royal family British monarch the children are born normal children so if Prince somebody or King somebody a couple has called them if their child come to America they would be talking and if they don't know who they are they will just grow up anybody else but backwards whatever it is so they are born as normal children but no re is what but for much of history the young churn of British monarchs were primary raised by nannies almost never mixed with commoners and spent most of the time being drilled by private tutors that would sound familiar in history decorum andrius languages they are tutored into royalty to think and act and dress and live a certain way and that is why you come to church that you could get pink into royalty that is why you come to get the word that you could be transformed by the renewing of your mind because they wasn't born and conscious of the royalty they have to be taught into it they have to be grown into it and you cannot be groomed into a wrong impression of a holy nation a peculiar people Oh God hallelujah Lord give the Lord a shout thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah so you did so the royalty did not like commoners the call us people commoners and you are not commoners you are attributes sons of his spirit and what butcher until unturned under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father so when Jesus rose from the dead he opened up the word open the understanding that disciples are royalty and they are going to receive power because the kingdom is not in word but in power spray is called but I have good news for you tonight the kingdom is preached and every man press their way into it so if you realize is not about church not about church now church is over when the kingdom come the church is over our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name die please God Hebrews 12:28 wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace that we miss if what acceptable with godly fear oh praise God hallelujah so all what I said before no he's a backdrop of what I want reach Oh hallelujah we talked about King we talk what Kingdom we talk what to mean we need topper church we only talk about kingdom repent for the kingdom of God is at hand Jesus taught what my kingdom is not of this world or glory of God in my kingdom was of this well my men would fight for me then the scripture when Allah said that the kingdom is not in word but in power so the kingdom have to come the Bible said he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God did not commit sons of God by some codes you have to get sons of God by power power has to come but we have a promise in acts 1:8 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you so all of these have scriptures all of this is the world do believe it tonight glory to God from why are people so toast about what a Branham the Bible said our last days there come a famine upon the earth not for bread and water alone but for hearing the truth of God now we are more books than ever more tense than ever more babies than ever more reasonable in the famine and that famine is on that famine is all tonight a real falen because it means that the gospel has to be tuned in didn't come like a bunny radio you get a kindly put them on their stations it's not what kind of stations you could go in all kind of music all kind of things but you have to get the right tune the right station right the gospel to feed you it has to be on the right station there'll be a family last days but that bride will not be not Fernando that Prime is season on the hidden mysteries that was revealed by Malachi for bringing listen listen all these hidden mysteries mysteries that people was a fee like auntie mysteries because I think they're talking too much about this mystery you know I just get problems when people talk to some other mysteries and their life is a mystery because you see Christ is the mystery of God

Lazarus come forth like the mystery of God people folded I'm a little beard that's what quit mistreated so all these mysteries and mysteries and mistreated because on the other side we talk about vials and trumpets and woes and one every Sun and the moon and different things on Danielle goes book no we will meet up mother it'll be translated the word so all these mysteries and we're gonna get it then I have it every tomorrow Barham says up in a prayer he said on all these mysteries the purpose of the message was to see the plainness of God that we might know how to conduct ourselves in this world we are living in that was the coat but one says that we might know the penis of God in other words the unfallen mish mysteries ain't nothing to get a head like a head bag your head because you know a lot of stuff then fall any mysteries is that you will see the penis of course and that will show you how to give yourself to come back to behavior so therefore adoption is not based upon a man Ceylon adoption is never being based upon a man's teaching adoption gonna be peace upon the man's behavior I call it the right kind of a son whatever can decide rascal sons political sons mean

Moses God taught Moses was gonna know what to do Moses begin to cry out because the detail and kora making fusses around him all of a sudden God with deep Moses and Moses open up the Red Sea but that's what we talking about nothing much hinder this Brian let me tell you something I love my sting a little bit he's gonna even death gonna stop this bracket there's the first people are needed to conquer death itself she kept proof we shall not all sleep we shall be changed not even that gonna conquer you just think about it that can reblock a common touch because you're deemed to be changed in a moment in a blink of an eye or that's why I show tonight glory forever somebody gonna comfortable flexion to pick on that resurrection Oh hallelujah praise God praise God Warren Paul what a mom said the Bible said they were coming last a famine nothing better alone but what we always hear when men listen when men are putting themselves up like gods and wanted to be glorified and people say

gonna inner what quit who were you walking with did not walk with God and found himself on the King's Highway and he continued walking Oh glory does I keep on walking with God one day gonna find yourself on the Kings Highway or give them or some praises people [Applause] you know Jesus random he said no they have fallen Messiah is Messiah he said do you see the same thing his church become his vermilion memo or the King talk we talked about look how a time right now the church becoming Dominion and he is king over his Dominion and we are kings and priests offering spiritual sacrifices of God the fruits olives giving praise to God and you are messiahs little anointed ones or praise the name of the Lord thank you lord so he was the Messiah which he was because he was anointed by the Holy Spirit and any church that's anointed by the same Holy Spirit is a messiah a little smaller God like small G and someday when this body is resurrected I hope beforehand that Court can get a hold of a bunch of people that will manifest his power in every dimension it's supposed to begin I love that manifest his power in every dimension missing limbs will be restored my god excitement stability you talk about healing I got a missing limbs being restored who you might be leaning for somebody getting back their foot their spleen their spine whatever whatever missing in your body are given unto you O Jesus give them the story about that sleeve taken from Africa come across to America and then the man came I've seen one event when he said no no no rhinoceros I was worrying about that man myself when I check him out I understand way back in Africa his father is a king of the track seeing the West middle about kings and stuff you have Prime Minister what we don't have standard concept they still have it in Africa kings and everything else we're back in Africa his father the king of the tribe and he knows he the son of a king that's right so he walks like one talks like one Oh what does that teach us it's not the environment environment didn't know who he was didn't crush his consciousness of his kingship [Applause] [Applause] you have to be conscious that's why I love what God put not just forgiveness but justification I'm justification is as you never did it no he said it ah you're justified so he have a sea of forgetfulness we don't we remember in all kind of stuff but God Himself big boss God Elohim or father he have a C chord is here forgetfulness when he take your stuff until insider dear not even the delicate fish at all but even himself to pull it out he just drop it and forget it so he see you as if you never did sin so tonight we have a perfect standing under the blood of Jesus Christ yes confidence and reacts given give us what we are or get the Lord on the condemnation of Jesus göran Oh göran so your restoration is to bring you back Internet atomic state where your world before the fall oh god my god 3d means to bring you back to bring you back it means you have to be somewhere before so you were dear yes you were supposed to be called there oh my Africa you know he's the son of a king he is conscious he eats and suspect everyone else environment does not change his consciousness and he's the son of a king environment does not change who he is our environment does not change his behavior excuses oh god because of this dad that's why a coffin dr. Swire coffee I wasn't intended to do that you know but you see when you do that if doctors when I give it to him see that that's what we're talking about nice the environment that you blame the environment that you know I didn't want it rich and I didn't I didn't but he provoked me shouldn't have done that should not have done that but he did it honey bitty bites for doing it see but we have to go past that now that's right one of the child has speaking like a child on the strip like a child when I become a man I put away childish things like a tell the church and I love it God didn't make you higher than the animals he make you a little lower than the Angels you could live better than that you could live looser than that it makes you understand lower than the Angels Oh hallelujah Christ Oh glory to God a man supports Kingdom oh okay I'm almost you finish it finish it very good God's kingdom is not of this hood God's kingdom is in our hearts and Jesus said the kingdom of God cometh ago at the kingdom of God is within you I like that and you say one time he said when they say lo here don't go no no no go go go the kid mother is in you nobody fool you with the kingdom school kingdom so we all come to this church to get the kingdom good to dismantle his kingdom somebody else kingdom lock down one time and CID put the five SB keys our hotel have open the roof kids Mississippi love oh my I was there say oh honey bees but he in his bees oh wow is that the kingdom of God is within you now Christ is ahead of this Messiah kingdom and you cannot organize a kingdom of which Christ is the head you cannot be nominate kingdom which Christ because Christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of man and make an organization to which Christ will govern therefore any companies there we go any people any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of God is going contrary to the king if you're going contrary to the king it will be against the king just digress Barham say that's pretty rough if I just had a more voice we make it much clearer is an antichrist spirit tries to take the people and call them from organization to organization or when I have together which will never was the will of God people have always trusted me because I struck so hard I polarizations it isn't the people indeed I'm striking that it's that here we go it's that dominating spirit that makes the people take we are the people so they're conscious no they are so this kingdom is the mystical body and you're presented God's people is this call Lord people and I believe this they are in every denomination they could be Catholic there could be protests on there could be Jewish there could be any kind of church but the real church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ now you cannot organize the mystical body of Christ Oh hallelujah please God so I'm gonna skip down or praise God oh yes okay so they become full member of the body when they are filled with the Holy Ghost because God took the spirit of a Christ raised his body places on the throne send back the Holy Spirit to make up the mystical body so the Holy Spirit mix up the mystical body which will be United at the marriage supper or the coming of the Lord you cannot organize it it is a mystery and from one as he said know watch the kingdom of God is the word made power so that is why the foolish version will never get the oil because they think that the wood and the secret is what the wood is on the bride it has to be some faithful men giving the wood out not going into you and then that will turn it the power is the kingdom hallelujah watch that for the kingdom is preached Oh glory to God so first Corinthians 4:20 the kingdom of God is the word God would made power what is the kingdom of God is within you the kid knows within you and when the word comes in dear what does this would begin it turns itself into power oh praise God I'm persuaded that many of us friends I receive the Holy Ghost but we have received enough Holy Ghost stuff and to make us stop please we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill your tinkin he was to fill your mind he want to feel you every bit just make you completely totally dead to yourself isn't that right who glory to God the power of his word what is the word what is the kingdom of God we got to belong to the kingdom before we can be subjects of the king oh God thank you Jesus I'm almost done here now Wow for the first time they will come forth for the right age for a resurrection of DOC denominationalism will be a message and this is a prophecy that the full maturity of the wood has turned back again to its full power and being weaved over the people by the same sign that wonders so that means that would prophesy into your heart has to become mature he said what faith isn't ripe enough intellectually we end the message so they have a prophecy over you that your feet will get ripe your feet being right means you have to connect with would have your promise of the holy ghost and the top is that right oh praise the name of the Lord so therefore the bride cannot recognize any other headship but the word and the head is connected with the body and the head is the word and the same word one headship so the bride can have no headquarters anyway the headship is Christ isn't done right Oh glory to God then our head chef is a kingdom I'm continuing the kingdom of God is within you then the kingdom we are not a denomination we learnt a kingdom and the Kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in your life so take the wood tonight take it raw take it beer take a dry ticket I said this is mine Oh

cornice let's let's wrap it up you know watch in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preach you have got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the
