pass as it was spoken and it shall accomplish the thing amen so we believe that tonight amen amen so let's turn to our Bibles without any further delay we like to read a portion of scripture in the Old Testament we like to read from 1st Samuel chapter 30 amen for scripture reading tonight for the message that God U I believe is inspired to me and uh had this a while now um but you know I think the Lord has ordered this day and so I feel that uh this is what God put up on my heart amen so 1 Samuel chapter 30 and vers 1 to8 it's a familiar story and it says and it came to pass when David and his men would come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burnt it with fire and had taken the word women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small that's amazing no one got killed in this attack but they carried them away and went on their way and so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep and David's two men uh two wives were taken captive aoam the jezreelite Tes and Abigail the wife of nabal the car uh the carite and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his son for his daughters but David in encourage himself in the Lord his God Amen tonight and David said to AB abatha the priest sorry ahc son I pray thee bring me hither the ephod and Abitha brought thither the ephod to David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I over overtake them and he answered him pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all may God have blessing to the reing of his word let's bow our heads one more time Heavenly Father Lord we've read your word

bless you 100f is our prayer amen so now for a title I have tonight amen uh for this little message tonight an unprovoked War that's my title tonight an unprovoked War I want to read a story here before I get into it um there a little story uh about a young girl's account and I just want to read it and you'll just grab the gist of it as we go through all right it says the beginning was on February 17th 2022 I was having physics classes online when we first heard explosions 10 km away they then began to land on nearby streets so it's coming closer our teacher instructed us to rush to the shelter when I got to the corridor I heard a loud explosion I only managed to sit next to the wall close my ears and open my mouth to avoid being shocked by the blast wave we then dashed to the basement closing the door only to have fragments fly across the basement the roof and the asphalt I sobbed it was a typical morning yet here we are the shelling continued in the days that followed on February 21st I awoke to the most powerful explosion just a big bang the birds flew and then there was silence it felt like the end of the world we didn't have time to go to the basement so my grand mother and I hid between two walls later that day we had a session with a physiologist uh or psychologist rather at the Village Club where we heard a loud explosion I realized it was somewhere around my house and I remember everything in bits and pieces how I got to my yard there was no windows in the summer kitchen how a window in the house completely fell out with all the pains and how I entered into my room and saw small sharpn piece that pierced the window and hanging on curtain hanging on the curtains when we went into hide in the basement of an apartment building beds on a stove and a table had been arranged there since 2014 when hostilities had first started in our region I was in the second grade then and I remember how it was in our village with tanks firing from the streets I recall how happy we were as children sitting in that same basement when a lady brought us cooked corn and so forth like that she goes on and she said the region uh where I live now is rather safe and I was able to spend the entire summer there I moved with my grandmother to the hostel to her house in July where we now live for free and in the Autumn I began my senior year in high school we be taking exams to study journalism at University I want to get a good education however I am still affected by the War I haven't heard anything from my mother in 8 months it would be a huge relief to learn that she is alive this story I just read is the account of a girl named Sophia who lived in Ukraine and this is her account of what happened in the invasion of Russia in February of 2022 and that is still presently going on right now this attack on Ukraine and its Beloved Country and its citizens seemed unfair it seemed unprovoked it seemed unwarranted it seemed uncalled for and I could only imagine that this is exactly how David and the people of ziklag felt when the amalekites Came Upon them on this faithful day in 1st Samuel chapter 30 let's read that verse again and it came to pass that when David and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South they there was an invasion and on their way through the invasion they happen to pass through ziklag and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burnt it with fire that's what the Bible says that what happened and here is David David in the prior chapters if you read back he was just returning from a disagreement he was just returning from a disappointing campaign uh a disappointing Journey uh he was supposed to go up with some Men of War uh but he could find no favor with them and uh they didn't want to go up with him they told him to go back where you come from we don't want you here so here is David returning from a failed campaign returning from a disappointment uh a disappointing journey of three days only to find more disappointment when he comes to his place of abod his place of living his place of dwelling isn't that right and sometimes brothers and sisters in our very own lives and in our very own Christian Journeys we end up in a situation in a war that seems unprovoked you didn't go around looking for trouble amen trouble came knocking at your door to test you to see if you really want to be a Christian to see if you really got your boots on to see if you really got what it takes to go all the way with God and if you're going to be a Christian tonight then you have to be able to prove every inch of ground that you claim to stand upon and tonight the devil is going to make you prove every inch of ground you claim to stand upon God told Joshua every place where the soul of your foot shall tread upon shall be yours therefore the fight of the enemy is to make sure your foot don't step on it but once you step on it it is yours oh because Footprints represent possession oh and we are called tonight to possess the gates of his enemy we were chosen tonight we were pre we destinated tonight out of all the people in the world out of all the souls that were walking H tonight God call you out of laia to possess this mountain oh Hallelujah Halle where are you at tonight oh hallelu if God be for us then who can be against us oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God Amen we didn't start this war this war started in heaven Michael and his angels fought isn't that right and the dragon took up opposition against Michael and his angels and you were there in that great Heavenly confrontation oh H isn't that right and the prophet told us amen your spirit was represented by those Angelic spirits that was up there in heaven oh Hallelujah you are represented up there that's who you are down here you are here what you are somewhere else your spirit is identified oh with the mighty Creator oh when he thought of you in his mind you was perfect when he thought of you in his mind you were victorious when he thought of you in his mind he knew you were more than a conqueror and because he conquered you can conquer tonight we are conqueror oh more than conquerors through him that loved us and that called us from the beginning oh can I get a shout tonight oh Hallelujah unprovoked you didn't go out looking for trouble trouble come knocking at your door isn't that just like life tonight isn't that just like the Christian Journey job didn't go out looking for trouble job was a righteous man job was there offering sacrifices doing his third coming to service early praying up the service and paying his tithes he was just doing his best am isn't that right oh unprovoked he was just living it out living on sweetness living in humility living an unified life oh praise God Lord hallelujah but the Bible says that the sons of God came up to worship and so did the devil oh the devil loves to come to church the devil loves to come and dress up and play Holy praise God hallelujah amen hallelujah he likes to come and cause trouble and stir up Mischief among the Brethren he is the accuser of the Brethren he is the one who has a form of godliness but denies the power thereof he can come this much close oh but no more he he can't get over into the upper room he can only go as far as Judas and betray the whole thing oh hallelujah we're going to expose him tonight oh for who he is he's a liar and a cheat he come to steal he come to Rob and he come to destroy oh Hallelujah H is that right unprovoked job is living his life unprovoked not attacked you know in peace as it was and here's God calling the devil to one side and say let me bring your attention to something what where are you now coming from devil said I've been to and fro walking around praise God isn't that right looking for trouble God said well look I've got a assignment for you here have you considered my servant job and the devil said sure I've seen him you've got a hedge around him you are he is God's favorite uh he is a blessed man I see that you are protecting him I I've seen him a long time I've been watching him a long time and God said listen I want you to take a crack at him I want you to come at him with all you've got but God said listen this is my game and I set the rules so I want you to come at him with all you've got he said but there's one rule you can't break devil you can't take his life friends I truly believe that if God did didn't tell the devil to not take job's life the devil would have taken his life that is without a doubt because the devil praise God does not want your life to give him glory oh amen he knows that there's no glory in death praise God so if God didn't set the rules of the game the devil would have played by his own rules so God said listen you're going to play this thing by my rules you're going to do as I say and I play out till do anything you want to him but don't you take his life his soul belongs to me tonight oh H and that's how you're here tonight that's how you come through the darkness that's how you come through the shadow that's how you come through every trial that's how you come through every testing every storm in your life your soul was in God's hands and the devil Hallelujah can't take it away from him oh Hallelujah your soul belongs to God you been through the fire you been through the shadow some through the waters some through the flood some through great trials but all come through the blood God will not leave one Soul behind he is a good shepherd tonight he will leave the 99 and he will go after that one tonight not one shall be lost not one shall be plucked out of my pasture we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture the devil had no rights coming against your family devil had no rights coming against your home you live in your life uh to in your part unprovoked and here comes the enemy Hallelujah uh he's entitled to a free blow at your body at your home at your family he God allow him to do that because he knows what's in you Hallelujah God knows what's in your heart tonight and he put something in there to stand a test to stand a trial isn't that right you end up in a war that seems unprovoked you didn't start the war you came and met it here we were born into a conflict a conflict between God and Satan isn't that right Heaven is pulling upwards and the devil and his forces are pulling downwards and we are caught in between what are we going want to do we got to choose whose side we are on tonight because like it or not we are in a war oh hallelujah unprovoked or not it's happening right in front of you if it hasn't started with you yet don't worry it's coming to a home near you to a theater near you it's coming it's coming twice the speed of lightning you better get ready tonight to stand with god oh Hallelujah isn't that right because sometimes that's all you can do everything else will be torn down because everything that can be shaken will be shaken so that the thing that cannot be shaken will remain and that is the word of God God said my heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away and his word says you shall be healed his word says you shall be delivered his word says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost his word says you shall receive power it is not for you to know the time or the seasons that the father is set in his power but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you power is getting ready to fire bomb your soul tonight the fiery seal of God's love is getting ready to be released upon a bride in the last days let's get ready for it tonight a Revival is coming oh Hallelujah pursue the enemy tonight oh we are well aable to overtake them God has given us the power to overcome the enemy on any grounds he stands upon he's already given us the most powerful weapon that ever existed it's the word of God it's the word of God speak that word tonight speak to the Rock oh and let let it bring forth its Waters tonight hallelujah amen and amen my God so David's home got attacked right when he had his back tun that's where the enemy did him dirty when your back is turned you didn't get a chance to defend yourself came without warning came without uh uh premeditation just coming at you from all sides and I myself feel like I I've been in an unprovoked War for about the past 3 weeks the devil was coming through the front door he was hitting the front door then he started hitting the windows then he started scraping at the ceilings like a cloud of Madness surrounding you on all sides praise God first it was my skin then it was my wife then it then it was Ezra then it was Eden and sickness and viruses and diseases and through all of this I had to hold on to faith somehow that God would work it out somehow that God would make it happen somehow that his Deliverance would come to me somehow I am a witness tonight that it is an unprovoked War you didn't go looking for trouble trouble come looking for you oh Hallelujah but God is able to Deliver Us from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall Preserve thy going out uh the Lord shall preserve thy coming in uh from this time forth uh and even forever more and the skin worms destroyed his body yet in my flesh I shall seek God for myself David said I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord the Lord has chasen me sore but he had not given me over unto death open to me the gate of righteousness and I shall go into them and I will praise the name of my God this gate into which the righteous shall enter tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh open to me those Gates tonight oh we are the children of Zion those gates are for you to come back home to your Dwelling Place to the place where you belong hallelujah oh hallelujah praise God sometimes it's when our back is turned it's when we least expected that's when the enemy chooses to come at us that's why we've got to be ready and stay ready for when the enemy would come at you your enemy is as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour isn't that right a pack of lions don't run up against a pack of wild boar or wild Wilder beasts they are smarter than that they can't tussle with those horns they get killed so what they do is they look around in the Safari Plains looking at the wild beasts and what they are looking for is a point of weakness they're looking for a point of entry they are looking for one to stray away from the pack far enough so that the lionesses could come up on approach and without warning they will strike and before you know it they're already upon you before you know it they've already severed the jugular and blood is pouring out and it's too late for the youngling then it's already it's cleaners time isn't that right the lionesses eat the meat first eat the bring the meat back for the the big lion and he has the and share and then he gives the rest to the younger ones praise God and that's the end of that isn't that right that's what the devil likes to do look for a points of weakness where he could tap at you to see where you are weak that's why God has released his spirit in these last days that's why he's passing us through valleys and through tests and through tempests and through Wilderness so he can strengthen the feeble knees so he can strengthen you at your weak points so he can strengthen you in the places where you are weak so that you can be fortified against the enemy who is as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour looking for weak points in your Christianity so tonight strengthen the feeble knees tonight there's a call to war going out oh I make sure your boots are shined up make sure your gun is loaded make sure your knife is on your side make sure your belt is straped make sure you know where your uniform is because at the sound of the alarm we have to go up and take the enemy before he takes us oh hallelujah hallelujah so who's going to go to war tonight who knows whose side you're standing on tonight oh as for me and my house we are standing on the Lord's Side we will serve the Lord oh H let us go up at once and take the land that he had sworn unto our fathers the land that was once delivered the land that was once given on Pentecost when the Holy Ghost poured out upon disciples waiting in the upper room it was once delivered and I know God can deliver it again if God gave the Holy Ghost once he could do it again if God gave his power once I know he can release it again and just like Samson I'm standing at the pillars oh god oh once more Lord send down the Holy Ghost upon this church uh once more Lord send down the anointing send down the power release your power release your Dynamics release your quickening power and may the sick be healed May the blind see May the walk and may the gospel be preached in its power that's what we're looking for tonight that's why we come to church because an event is about to unfold and we want to be ready Hallelujah when he comes he says behold I come quickly my reward is with me it's with him the Seal of God is with him to seal every man in their forehead every woman who was faithful and true who have kept the words of this book he's coming with your reward to give every man according to his worku amen so we got to work tonight but I don't mind working because he died for me I I got to work for him he saved my soul from despair he saved my soul from depression i' I've got to work for him tonight oh how many feel that way amen amen praise God isn't that right so these guys that came and attacked David they were the amalekites Apparently these are descendants of Esau amen this tribe was a pesky tribe to Israel they were like a Scourge isn't that right upon the land these are the same tribes that attack Moses and the Hebrews that were coming out of the Wilderness so many years before isn't that right God had a bone to pick with these guys even back then and tonight they came without warning sometimes the enemy comes that way isn't that right in the days of Shamar when the people labored and sowed and kill their land the Philistines would come unprovoked and harass the people and take their crops take their increase take their Harvest everything that they work so hard to do these these these pests these these these these low lives come and take their reward from them isn't that right and God raise up a man called Shamar who had had enough than enough he had had more than enough of what was Tak place and he took an ox go isn't that right and challenged 600 Philistines isn't that right and he beat the Philistines so much that his actions actually delivered Israel from that day forward isn't that right oh Hallelujah the Bible says in verse two they took the woman captive and they that were in therein but slew not any we were talking about that earlier right and I found that that was such a tremendous verse in the scripture that even though though this attack was happening even though David was powerless to stop what was going on none of the people were killed in this attack and this always speaks to me to the grace of God that is in the midst of every trying situation we can always look and see that it could have been worse it could have overcome us it could have taken over us the proud Waters could have overtaken our soul but for the grace of God where would we be tonight his hand was still in the midst of your storm and you are going to recover all that you lost just have faith in God tonight in the god that is able to deliver in the god that is able to restore in the god that is able to redeem to restore to bring back to a former state of condition there's a promise of restoration in this story here tonight isn't that right amen amen so these four words are very very notably mentioned they slew not any and this is the grace of God isn't that right to David in this situation you can always see in every situation that there's the grace of God in it God's hand was still in it despite what was happening to you despite feeling like you were powerless Hallelujah still God was in it he does not give you more than you can bear and with every Temptation he makes a way of Escape for your soul tonight this is our God tonight he is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and plenteous in Mercy amen and amen if you're in his hands tonight then we have to testify of the mercy of God so David's men came to that City David and his men came to the city and behold it was bur with fire and their wives and their sons their daughters were taken captive and the people lifted up their voice and wept this was the response until they had no more power to weep they cried until they were ran out of Tears they cried until they had no more cry left in them there were just moans and pitiful size of grief and despair this is the situation that we are seeing here unfolding in the scripture David's two wives were taken and so on the Bible said David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him oh these men were human just like us they were had like passions just like us hallelujah they felt the same pains that we feel even in our day and in and in our time and with our situations they felt the same pains that that we feel oh it feels good to know that tonight that this Bible is full of stories stories of men just like us women just like us who had fears and doubts just like us but just like us God put something inside of their souls God put something inside of their beings that was beyond the natural it was it wasn't normal what they were doing by faith because it was something that God put inside of them by predestination that God knows that in the moment when it is needed the most when they reach deep down and inside the call that God put in their heart comes to the four and everything else goes in the backdrop and they said Lord if it's you bit me come oh I I know the storm is out there but I can't deny that it is Jesus oh it is Jesus it is Jesus in my soul oh oh I have touched the ham of His Garment and his blood had made me whole I know what I felt was real I know hallelujah oh and I want a double portion of oh praise God of that mantle I know

thing that I felt I know it's real regardless of what I see around me I can't deny the call is in my heart amen and that's the way we feel tonight something Beyond us is calling us higher friends calling us to the Holy Ghost calling us to a birth calling us to adoption calling us to Perfection calling us to handle that sword to be able to hold it firmly with all the faith that you've God Seven tunders give you Fai to cut out the promises of God tonight for this last day you are the one that was raised up for such a time as this tonight oh Hallelujah you've got to believe it so David was only human he was distressed Hallelujah not just distressed but greatly distressed when you are in it it affects you they always say hindsight is 2020 you look back and you could see clearly and you're not in the emotional thing you can look back and see all what God has done but when you're in it you can't see nothing because it's flying debris everywhere and your emotions are shut and you are you're going through it and it feels like there's no answer it feels like there's no cure it feels like no one is giving you the satisfying portion or or the answer to your problem or the the the the the the the uh uh the answer to your cry but God has the answer tonight he set it up in such a way that you can't find it anywhere else but in the presence of God you can't find what you're looking for unless you come to me Jesus said come unto me all that you are laid burdened and heavily Laden I'll give you rest if you want real rest you'll find it in Jesus tonight amen and amen so it affects you you're not a robot God knows the pain that you feel in your current condition in your current situation isn't that right hallelujah amen so all the people all the soul of the people was grieved every man for his sons and daughters David understood where that grief was coming from that's right he wasn't mad at the people for wanting to Stone him they wanted someone or something to hold responsible for their loss because they felt powerless in the situation here it was everything they had was taken from them and now somebody has to be responsible for why we're in this mess isn't that right and so the people saw no other person to blame but David even though his back was turned and even though he didn't know about it he had no clue what was going on until he returned yet somehow they are wrongfully accusing David for causing all of this trouble all of this unwarranted uh uh uh distress all of this unprovoked wrath that is being poured out upon them and David wasn't mad at them because he knew where he was coming from he he was a mature Christian see when people Point accusations at you and they try to drag your name down and they try to bring you down you've got to know where that's coming from you've got to know that there are spirits at work amen come on tell me help me out somebody you got to know that the devil is at work and he's trying to assassinate your character he's trying to get you to fight at his level down there in the emotional realm where you're having a pity party and oh who is me and nobody understands me and nobody knows the trouble I see the devil wants you to fight down there at that level but what Eagles know how to do is to take the battle higher take the battle on Higher Ground oh Lord plant my feet tonight on Higher Ground oh you take that snake up when he wants to drag you down pick him up and carry him where the air is thin where the air is rare where you can spread your wings and be who God meant you to be lift yourself up in prayer lift yourself up in the anointing lift yourself up in the presence of God the only way to go up uh is to get down low on your knees and get some neology oh and when you do that God will raise you up so they were greatly distressed but but but David encouraged himself in the Lord sometimes that's the only place you could Encourage Yourself you can't find enough courage in Facebook you might find it on WhatsApp you might find it on Instagram you might find it on the street or in your job but but but in the Lord is where you can find encouragement for your soul because Thy word oh Lord is settled in heaven forever when you are unsettled the word of God is settled in your situation when you feel perturbed when you feel shaken the word of God is very sure the word of God is a very secure spot and if you could ever get to the word tonight oh you'll find more peace that the world has to offer if you can only get to the Fountain that's drawn from Emmanuel's veins where Sinners plge beneath that flood uh lose all their guilty stains if you can find that Fountain tonight you'll find peace that surpasses all understanding you'll find the answer to all your problems and even if you don't have the answer you have a Blessed assurance that he will give his answer in his time when he is ready the Tre Hebrew boys told the king we are not careful to answer you in this matter oh Hallelujah you have given a decree for us to bow down and we will not bow down and even if our God don't deliver us we are not careful to answer you in this matter we will not bow down hear it and hear it good we will not bow down oh Hallelujah Hal and the King got mad and the King got mad and he got mad and his Visage changed he was so rought with anger he said fill the fire seven times hotter oh he was willing to sacrifice his own men to prove a point but God loves when the situation gets hotter God loves when there's no way out God loves when they bind your hands in fets and chains of iron and they carry you to the fire oh because he made the fire in the first place oh he's a God that spoke everything into existence oh hallelujah hallelujah oh he loves to get in the fire with his children oh don't you worry little fluck he is in the fire with you tonight oh he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you he is with you tonight oh he said behold I am with you until the end of the earth oh Hallelujah even forever and ever amen amen amen oh Hal word of God is the same tonight hallu and I believe it amen amen David understood see they were defenseless they were unarmed unprovoked attack and they left in ruin loss and destruction but David encouraged himself in the Lord you have to find a way to encourage yourself more than anything else this thing happens all up here in the mind it messes with your mind whatever trial or situation you're going through Hallelujah it messes with your mind because your eyes are seeing things that would cause you to doubt yes
