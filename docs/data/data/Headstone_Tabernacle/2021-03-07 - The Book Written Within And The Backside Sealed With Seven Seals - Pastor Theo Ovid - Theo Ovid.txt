revive and bless your people father and if you approach your word may you'll take me out of the way and jesus might ask it amen god bless you it's so good to be here in his presence while you're standing could you turn your bibles to revelation chapter 5 1-7 we want to look at revelation 10 1-4 and revelation 8 verse 1 first scripture reading we appreciate the messages going past anthony to the door but isaac to know him his life we certainly appreciate amen brethren standing in the gap and sharing this burden and work of the ministry chapter 5 of revelation i saw in the writing of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals i saw a strong angel proclaiming a lord voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man in heaven not in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book near to look there on and i went much because no one was found worthy to open and to read a book needed to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the land of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book until lucie seven cease thereof and i be held in lieu in the midst of the throne of the forbeas in the midst of the elders to the lamb it has been slain having seven owns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne reading version 10 verse 1 so the lamb took the book on version 10 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven through with the cloud rainbow was upon his head his face as it were the sun his feet are still as the fire and he had in his hand a little book open so the book is no longer in heaven but come down to the earth he said his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth carried a lord voices when he land wrought and when he had cried seven thunders after the voices and when the seven turners had uttered the voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which attempt on this uttered and write them not last scripture revelation 8 verse 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about his peace of hafer now let's pray father we thank you for your will this morning and we pray come and interpret it to our hearts lord and confirm the word with signs oneness and miracles and whatever condition whatever needs here may the need be met by the operation of the holy ghost by the spirit and the probe of the spirit and by you having a preeminence in and through our lives in jesus name i ask it amen you will be seated we'll praise god thanks for coming out uh praise god so now that you are here you want to benefit from being here in the service of the lord and you want to apply the word and feet amen because many people uh in israel the word that they heard wasn't mixed with feet and it did not profit them so i said this way to you two thousand two million people heard books and tapes heard moses message but only two out of two million understood what it was all about so it's not who here is who have desired men from what they hear it's not even the word seed is the kind of heart that receives the word seed because some fell on the wayside same for same fall and among among thorns and so on some fell upon rocks and so on but some fell on good ground so there's nothing wrong with the seed the seed is fine hallelujah is the soil and the soil is the environment soil is the atmosphere the soil is where make the difference what happens and the effect of that seed upon your life every service that comes they get come they get seed and it's up to you to receive it inwardly and willingly hallelujah not outwardly but inwardly and willingly oh glory to god i want that seed i want that word i wanted to be made flesh inside of me so this morning i have a title the book written within and the backside seal with seven seals as a title the book written within and the backside sealed with seven seals i have an inspiration the spoken word the written word and the living word that was the title of a message i preached about a month ago the spoken word the written word and the living word amen praise god you love him this morning god is good god loves you you know hallelujah i god love you i better share the quote with me i want to share to you this morning he said well someone might say i'd like to say this to people inside and out you might say but preacher i'm just a poor man god already made me oh yes he does there's a little place in god's heart says the song and it's no one in a song it's true no one else can take that place but you god speaks to you it's you you are the only one that could fulfill that spot in god's heart he waits for you he wants to talk it over with you he wants to have a conference with you come and reason together before you have to meet this judgment because it's going to be terrible then and you can't talk it over then it's too late then you say i'm a bum i don't care what you are i'm a drunkard i'm an immoral woman i did wrong preacher i live untrue to my marriage vows i've done immoral things i have drunk i have smoke i have gambled i have stole i have light i don't care what you have done god called you and said come let us reason together your sins may be like scarlet but it'll be white like snow if you will come let us talk over a little bit and i want you to hold it as an anchor is that i call myself no man could come except the father no man can come and say the father draw him is that right jesus called you the devil's a liar tonight this morning god called you no man didn't call you god called you i didn't give you a backseat in 40 years god called you and the same god that called you 40 years ago he's still calling he's waiting you this morning oh glory and the only reason why he can wait on you you know why he written on you because your name is on that book that we read about this morning that little book that book glory to god glory to god and the devil couldn't go in that book because no man was found worthy to look on it or even to open it and more than that the book is ever sealed with seven seals it had something written on the inside it didn't say something written on the outside it says seven seals on the outside but they have something written on the inside your name was written in deer and god seal it oh glory to god with seven seals and you are going to be sealed [Music] with seven seals oh glory to god amen praise the lord amen amen jesus said if from your heart you don't forgive every person their transgression neither does your heavenly father forgive you so just get that close if there is one art in your heart against any person sinner or saint you are in danger of hell fire you don't want to say amen to that i ain't here 100 say amen i'll go read it again oh glory i'm going to read it again we want to walk around in church and in this message with odds and grudge and long old standing foolishness danger hellfire hell really you know we talk about heaven and power and glory hell just as real you know [Applause] jesus said if from your heart you don't forgive every person their transgression neither does your heavenly father forgive you so just get that close if there's one ought in your heart against any person sinner or saint don't just tell me i love your own sinner or saint don't just tell me about people in the church sinner or sin not you have no right to heart take no odds not when the lamb was unworthy not when the lamb took the book you wasn't ready it wasn't even no you know nothing glory to god when jesus died he died for you he wasn't born yet he wasn't named you didn't manifest yet he died for you and all them devils in hell them devils had going off just yet they're jumping from generation to generation to generation and waiting the holy ghost going the holy ghost jumping from generation to generation to generation you couldn't miss this if you're trying oh glory to god the devil is a liar this morning amen brother heathcliff you couldn't miss us if you try oh god hallelujah glory to god glory to god them demon powers when them all them devils and wicked people die waiting the spirits upon them going looking for our next body to judge up or when a god servants men of god turner god died the holy ghost looking for sons of god to anoint god's spirit is on the earth is god's spirit anointed sons when jesus died seven spirits was released to all the earth it was sent to trinidad all glory to god sent to the caribbean it was sent over your village over your house glory to god god tell jeremiah why it was in your mother's womb i will tell you a prophet to the nation your glory to god i don't care what condition you in this morning if your name is on that book there is no demon to stop you from coming out of that prison you're in this morning you are going free i don't care what sin i don't care what passed i don't care what failure i don't care where you fall and fell you are going to go free this morning oh glory to god hallelujah my maybe seated all right let's go let's get to work second peter 3 verse 9 says the lord is not slack concealing his promise as some men constructness lord hath in no slackness hallelujah but his long suffering to us what not willing and he should perish but it all should come to repentance so the reason that god stretch out time and it's looking so long is because he want more to repent and turn around he wants you to turn from your wicked ways he wants you to turn from the evil ways he plead him he pleaded he pleaded your case or give the lord a shout when you're going down doing your own stuff hallelujah still waiting on you oh hallelujah but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat with also on the works that are daring shall be burnt up seeing them that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons or he to be in all holy conversation that conversation that talk is that that means behavior life holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with favored heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heaven on you earth where indirect righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that's the order be diligent that you can be found in him in peace without spot unblameless not found frustrated who cannot get ticket no more in peace hallelujah oh my so redemption is in two parts we know that coming out of and going into everybody come out of the challenges going into two million people came out of egypt that's something real nice a lot of people coming out pharaoh lost a lot of people but how many cross own into the promised land because that land of the holy ghost is our land that's that all that that they went through israel was in just type amen that was a shadow of the real thing journeying from egypt the world into the land of promise and when you get to that i promise that's where the battle begins you have no fight on your way to the journey you're just complaining for bread and food and water and welcome that journey talk that is processed the real fight begins in the land to get to the land god asks the ministers to go out and bring a report to bring evidence to show that i am god i'm faithful i'm true just what i say about you because they know about their acts on the line god give abraham allah this is god fulfilling this word god they actually questions you know god promised to deliver you become known himself to call your name praise god when the lamb took the book and lose them series that was the finish that was finished right then because you see once the name is loosed you can't stop it then you see the seven spirits is to go out to get their names thrown all the earth are you giving a bad rum drinking adultery fornication line i don't care where you are them seven spirits oh glory to god i have to find the seeds where that oh glory to god and jesus said he gave a powerful power he said the son of man is the show and the seal are the children of the kingdom no the son of man saw the good seed which is the word but all of a sudden the word become children oh hallelujah so you are planted by god you don't even know that but god put seed in you to make you seed and because you are seed god will fill you with the baptism and holy ghost by experience i want to emphasize that by experience he gonna fill you with the holy ghost failure not sprinkling your failure not to feel the anointing failure they don't talk about it but we're still going to say it he's going to fail you he wants to fill you with power oh glory to god hallelujah amen coming out and going into this is what god wants to do now see the vision of what you have to go into oh glory to god hallelujah no sin john 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god hallelujah the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made in him was life that way getting life from in him outside of him no life in him was life and the life was the light of man if you don't have his heart life you can't have the light in him was life if you want life you have to go to him not not dr holy hell he had to go to him not some message pope you have to go to him and him had life oh glory to god you have to see who he is oh not who the church is but who he is in him as life and the life was the light of men isn't that right and the light shined in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not understood it not there was a man sent from god and it was john the same came for a witness to be a witness of the light that all men to him might believe he was not that light he was not that light but was sent to their witness of that light that was the true light which lighted every man that come into the world he was in the world one the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own receive him not but as many as receive him the word to them give he power to become the sons of god this is not an instant thing this is you be coming you've been transformed you are in you're growing you're learning you press him god will expect you just to get baptized in jesus name and your manifested son tomorrow it's not working that way it said as many as receive him to get him give me power pray power virtue power dad knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness or glory to god you are seated down with knowledge and then something have to take place because you can't give yourself faith that's a revelation come give the lord a shout you can't give yourself virtue that's power that's from god [Applause] and that knowledge is not intellectual knowledge that's also from god oh glory to god so that there's three things given and that is like a seed in you and that sea falls down into the ground then temperance is something you do you have to get control i'm not hearing you hallelujah that's what you gonna do that's how you're gonna overcome the sex spirit and the immoral spirit god put that virtue of self-control to deal with all the sexual issues oh come on preach back to me somebody temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness every issue have the ability of god to deal with by those seven perfect spirits that god loose oh hallelujah hallelujah self-control self-control like that we thought about self-control that's not exalting about self-control that's an action in your life oh glory to god you have certain things you're not supposed to eat [Music] it looking nice it's smelling nice they go kill you nobody are forcing you to do anything but somebody offered you you watch it you walk wrong it you smell it it's still smelling good you take a little sample it'll taste good but is he eating he's going to kill you that was self-control coming temperance that's not the angel holding in the back you know cause injured homer hold me back hold my hand hold my hand and hand going towards the cake hold my hand and the angel watching you in your foolishness you plead with the angel to hold your hand oh god that kick and that's opposite oh the game give me power to become that's why brahms said make yourself a christian make yourself a christian don't paint and paint yourself i'm a christian i'm never seeing you for it like me i see me as a christian that don't mean that i see him as saying whatever in the garage is a car it's not so have a lot more inside of there so so don't say because you have a seal everybody a christian make you have to want that other people in church you are not christians they just go to church they are not christians the prophets talk about three kinds of believers this i'm not gonna do it i believe this have to do with life not have to do with belief have to do with life all right which were born out of blood nor the will of flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we heal his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth okay be continuing first john 1 1 2 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which have looked upon our hands have handled of the word of life and this is the part i want to get to for the life was manifested and we have seen it there's not talking about it there's not explaining it the life was what was what it was manifested that means the life can be manifested of course you put a corn on her corn seed or or up tomato seed and you're not sure what life in it bury it and then the life begin to unfold it has to unfold that's what it is all this thing about seven church ages all it was is the life unfolding you know the rapture will be unfolding too you know abraham was he not was walking with god you know and then after what he was not it unfolded all of a sudden he get light and he just took off oh glory to god hallelujah and if you are seed of god it has to unfold so when it was in music when he was in the party when he was in a dance and god flipped you around and turned around and you get baptized in jesus name it was you it was him because all that the father had given him shall come so you can you send your baptist church methodist church pentecostal church you have to come out so god released a message to call you out but not just to call you out to bring you in oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah and this to bring you in now is to bring him to be a manifested son and to be a manifested son you have to get back to the book that adam lost because that book had the authority you see everybody had to be authorized they have laws and rules and regulation by which they give the policeman authority to the locker people and always a man can come and say i'm police because i'll pull uniform and he said i'm a police are coming to the lock you up way about be authority well you know i'm my brother my brother is a real policeman and i borrow his uniform and you know i was acting it doesn't have that that's like paula and peter i know who are you you see you can't come and act that it has to be authorized so that is when you have the legal authority of what is written hallelujah so that is why it was written to give sons the legal authority so the devil had a right to be the chief squatter because no son produced the deed to challenge the devil from his squatting position on the earth did you hear that well adam felt the devil had full rain you know he said good i have full clearance i do what i want to do start to go with the torah babel he's had to do all kind of thing science and technology start that'll go down the road so and god only signed mystery after mystery abraham fate isaac love jacob grace prophet after prophet god laying up a platform to bring back the sons all his objective was to bring back the sons the killing bulls and goats and bullocks trying to make an atonement until the perfect lamb had to come and when the lamb come the devil know this man was a little different if though be if toby know you're who you are if dolby if toby if toby and all jesus has written this written it is also written so when jesus go on now jesus had to pepper them and cast out devils and the first time they seen devils being cast out oh glory to god he started rebuke devils so glory to god heal the sick all kind of miracles the only ones what man or man is this he's had to call some men he said well you always wanted them to you know or or they would be just like me you know or only the little one on me you know i'm only a small version of what i am praise god this is what you're going to be i'm going to reflect on what you have to become because i call you to make disciples oh glory to god and before you can make disciples you have to become a disciple oh glory to god come on preach back to me somebody and i call you to make it so you show them the end game that you are going to be these the fishes of men or give the lord a shout or if the devil only knew he never let jesus go to calvary if the devil only knew even the lord jesus died of all age but when jesus died and he shed his blood and he paid the price i see nobody at the stable nobody have to say bongo stay tied up still you could go free this morning glory glory you you may be seated not the final offer the devil for jesus he said all this kingdom on his mind correct as a squatter and and and all you have to do is to you know you rather go take the car he's trying to get into the calvary because calvary is where the price was paid for what for the book because when the lamb when the one sat on the throne with the book sealed no man was found worthy john began to weep who was worthy who is worthy all the years since adam fell waiting for somebody to get to that book that little book that is written within and sealed with seven seals if we can't get to the book we can't come back if we can't get back to the book we can't come back to eden if we can't get back to the book there'll be no adoption there'll be no resurrection we have to get the book this book is more important than you think this book is more important than your job this book is more important than your wife than your husband than your children [Music] [Applause] i looked you look under there no man were they look around no man were they angels don't worry about no man had to be a man how they be a man a king's man no angel to come and try to take no book had to be a man so god knew he'd take a man to take the book so god became man the word became flesh for glory to god oh hallelujah he has sent no angels to do that piece of work he came himself he had to put on that work himself okay the lord has shout first thessalonians for the lord himself glory to god no man from america no man from china no man from south america the lord himself [Applause] [Music] and you

this morning oh glory to god hallelujah [Music] it doesn't matter how much money you make how much money you have on those cars houses land whatever you still have to come down to the end point oh glory to god to the last pieces of your life where your book will be closed oh glory and god have a book too oh your life is a book your life is a word oh hallelujah every day a page of your life is being turned oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah now my david said come help me number i know to behave myself and operate with a level of wisdom and not stupidity of another wisdom and not being dull hallelujah be sensitive that the common law joy at night if not in my generation the next generation but the lord is coming you already stand with a shout ministers fighting one another they are saying the lord delay is coming that is their foolishness though i have no part of that the lord a delay is not coming he is waiting on a bride that would step forward to produce a revival to get to know who she is who where she come from and who the devil is let me say this to you one thing the devil hates is individual revelation he hates when god could you could get revelation and the reason god could give revelation to the literate you don't need to have head read and write to get revelation revelation is god speaking to your heart direct the word pumping spoken word the man preaching from the written word but the living word which is the logo still of fire god himself he coming and reveal himself to you he asked them who do men say i am some say this some say that some people like to talk about others they can't say nothing about their self they can't give no personal testimony they like to report on what others saying and whatever is doing but jesus calling him give him a question but isaac who do you say i son of man oh glory i have a question for you tell me tell me tell me oh glory to god in the scots in the head because they didn't know they were following without revelation when peter said though i the christ the son of the living god jesus said flesh and blood and we need to hear more of that we need to hear people who break past flesh and blood heart not reveal it unto you but my father hath revealed it upon us unto you and i say lord pete and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell so don't tell me hell beating you up you need revelation he said upon this rock we need to cry for revelation upon this rock we need to get in the spirit to get revelation wrote don't come and look for me and what brother you're trying to say i ain't trying to say nothing i call the minister the word i come to bring the word and the word delivers you the word will bust through your mind bless your human spirit you have to get out your own self hallelujah praise god hallelujah praise god praise god amen for the life was manifested that means the life could be manifested think about it watch age 12 to 30 silence jesus is saying nothing you're going to template and hear them preaching open interpretation all kind of coco revelation and he's saying a word that is control that is temperance the living word sitting in service and here in scribe and pharisees sunday sabbath day after sabbath given contrary conclusions revelations and inspiration when jesus when jesus received his blessing from above fully holy ghost in his fullness i overcome the devil in the wilderness without showing a clue of his power that was resident because you see you see on the outside but you don't know what is hidden on the inside so jesus was given the devil spoken word about the written word so he said it is written man's channel he was quoting the written word he was speaking the word to the devil and he was the living word so the living word was quoting back the written word to lucifer without one display of power he said it is written it wasn't a man called in that you know it was the living word the word made flesh the word of life oh glory to god because god was so mysterious this print form is this a veil this print form is hidden stuff inside the deer you have to seal it up and even with revelation there still remains a supernatural element because god still wants to reveal himself so jesus when he overcome the devil the first thing he did was to hit the temple and when they call up who want to read he he said i want to read they keep calling who want to come and read scripture jesus raised them yes sir first time in many years he came to read scripture and he found the place where it was written because you had to feel read the script they want to read the spirit is upon me that wasn't talk that wasn't prophecy that was present tense he was quoting the written word and it was fulfilling he was fulfilling the written word quoting the word itself the spirit is upon me where he anointed me to do this that that that that and afterwards he said this day you see what you see written here talk over this was spoken by the prophet isaiah 61. this year is not history this is not texas exhort this is a life today so i could say it's fulfilled because i am here and the spirit is upon me to fulfill what about the bride the spirit and the bride say come that means the bride have to come into her position to fight her scriptures to be anointed with the spirit and then you become the spirit's voice spoken word once more the world will get direct from god there's no book on tape thing this is direct from god god coming out your mouth could we give the lord a shout not the definition of logos of speech a word uttered by a living voice a living voice i like that to speak the word so when peter received the holy ghost he was in god's kingdom as a son and he become a channel of god so god could not be released through the lips of a son by spoken word oh glory to god so peter was in the body so for cornelius to get a breakthrough god had to send the anoint cornelius to send for peter for peter to get a breakthrough gotta give it a vision to rise kill and eat something that he knows he don't touch at all and god of the show peter you can't call what you call unclean i call clean so we're talking two different languages here gotta show him you have to change your thinking because he's sending it to a people you don't know about i just understood where you don't even think you have to go you're going so guarded to prepare peter's heart mind and spirit to adjust his thinking what about your thinking where are you going with your thinking your thinking limits you god had to adjust your thinking if you received a different picture altogether so when peter was getting the call a man named come here send for you that's gentile you're talking about cornelius and why peter speak the words what the words what words the words spoken word coming out of his mouth holy ghost glory to god the word written word spoken word and now the seals oh the holy ghost you know the holy ghost is the seals you know the season the back of the book is the holy ghost you know the holy ghost is the seal of the living god and that's used in seven parts you know when god's healed you we see it with seven spirits all on them seven spirits would overcome the devil in every age all glory licked them up in every age red orange red white horse every ears the believers overcome oh give the lord a shout god release the land anointing god release the auctionoid hill god release the man anoint him god release the eagle anointing to make sure the anointing is right to deliver them for the age and he prophesied that there's going to be a super church come on now it's going to be a super race wait till we get to the back of the book them back seals them thunders all glory the dempseys and the blackest thunders them voices themselves in the back of the book as thunders it's also voices oh give the lord a [Applause] shout [Applause] a word uttered by a living voice a living voice not just scripture texts but a living voice some of these texts have to come alive how to become a living voice so it'll be a living word spoken word remember those brothers have no scriptures their words will become in scripture oh glory to god do you get that when the holy ghost hit them there they were the living word and their words become scripture peter words become scripture first peter second peter first timothy second timothy what give the lord a shout [Music] [Applause] they will not rehearse in the old testament they were saying this is that that the prophet jewish speak of this is that the desire speak of this is that and you and i we will be a continuation of another book of acts take the lord amen brother kangali okay the lord this is a place to shout this is a business scream this is a place to worship we know what we worship we know why we worship we know we [Applause] worship maybe it's easy understand this the baptists don't know this the pentecostal ancestors they know that church group could access this but those who are cooperating with a message understand where jesus dies to save us that wasn't just he died to save us he died to get this book because the restoration of this book means your inheritance restored your life restored your deliverance your family your loved ones spoken word healing all you have need of is in this [Applause] book watch look how good this guy is at the bible genesis isaiah revelation devil job just keep you away from the book you know david said thy word have i hid in my heart that i not sinned against me he hide the word in his heart oh god because he knew he was a covenanted son when david was in a condition and his spirit bung up he said lord restore unto me not my salvation you know the joy oh glory when your joy with our weight trouble when your joy went away you're not reading the bible when your joy went away you don't want to come to church it's a stress it's a strain when your joy weather away you're struggling but when you get back your joy you say i was glad when they said unto me push back the coronavirus yeah yeah yeah yeah there is only time you know it's a more place to come because the sons of god are going to stop diseases all glory to god god just testing us we can stop cancer stop humor stop diseases if we should stop that you tell me we can't be back at children come on give the lord a shout [Applause] let me see god didn't waste time when you put your name on the book god not only dumb dumb business hallelujah no no fixing up your name like um let them come true don't talk that can i talk it's before the foundation you hear what i said before the foundation before the beginning oh glory to god before the beginning before lucifer was created before them devils befall them grey hair and back pain and this and they feel it all put your name on that book no wonder why all glory john said all in heaven all under the earth when the lamb took the book jumps out to get on the eldest cast on the clung or glory that got the jump of the children they start to say this is time to shout them angers only looking though their means are doing understand what on earth is going on they may enjoy they get the revelation that we were lost that we fail we have to get back and the only way back is by this book this book is bringing us back this book written within on a backside sealed with seven seals this is the book to bring us back adam had the book because adam was a son in image and likeness having got intent and purpose and adam had the book to call the names they call it set they called hebrew to call him he was supposed to speak it eve produced it by spoken word adam was supposed to be a living word bringing spoken word and them sons conceiving by spoken word spoken with sons so when jesus come the first thing he said not the second another you must be born again by the word and spirit so he's showing you how to come back a spoken word so you're not born by flesh and blood but as many have received him the damn give you power that were born not the flesh and blood [Applause] born by the incorruptible seed of the word of god whose son are your mom whose daughter you know is that your mother and father they give you fleshly features and whatnot but that germ inside them cast up that oh glory to god hallelujah you have to come forward the devil have to give up on you so now remove him where the devil can no longer touch you where's you giving your own self trouble oh give the lord a shout in the house my god you're not making of you to preach you know making me feel to preach you're getting away where the devil can't touch you but you can tie up yourself you can bind yourself you can trap your own self [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you mean you can yes how's somebody give a story another real story but it's something that you gained from it alaina man walking in the jungle i demanded the lion are you stronger than you can i said no you're not different things they're arguing back and forth i can't have a big picture of a man conquering a lion and the man tell the lion you see that i tell you i'm stronger than you look at that picture you rely on us who draw that who draw that when the twelve spies went into the land they say in our own eyes we like grasshoppers it's a giant who draw that in their own eyes this they oh they dismodify themselves i know another word they belittle themselves they bring the self to grasshoppers it's not the temptation is the issue is that is the power because if you recognize you have access to that and you focus on that you walk on top listen you see how they put their foot on the king's neck in the in book of joshua you'll be putting your foot on your trials don't tell me you can't do it because peter walk on water without the holy ghost don't come with that don't tell me you can't do that we have a lot of things we could do even without the holy ghost they had joy without the holy ghost they were praising god without the holy ghost they were worshiping with all the holy ghost come on now they were standing for the world without the holy ghost but the holy ghost was coming oh give the lord some glory now watch voice of the throne voice of the stars voices there was more in version four here five out of the two and proceeded light and turn the voices not one voice voices what was it god speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits when the true anointing of god speaks it's the voice of god to reject it is to remove the candlesticks see voices the voice of the seven church edges over here in the corner the voices speaking with ton and lightning nowadays they say oh we don't believe in seeing hell in the pulpit oh mercy we need men of god men who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people assuming he said if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you are not you're still a preacher so all of you here today we are preachers all you're a preacher all right watch if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people of sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god wait a minute a live sermon is a voice a torx man is stuck it's the written word but is not yet the living word until until it lives and that becomes the voice so speaking spoken word a written word living word when it comes into your faith and your flesh then the word is living hallelujah praise god it was beautiful in the bible study last but isaac brought out that joseph himself didn't understand the trajectory of his life in egypt just dictating the grain history of pharaoh so he thought he was blessed to be in the managerial ceo position to be assistant to pharaoh to run the show but when his brothers came he recognized it was a little more than that that all this brain storing stuff is to preserve his family's life that god have seen on the earth so all the trial and testing you go through you don't know god has been in labor pain for you what stuff you're talking about god was in labor pains when he was bringing you forward that's why i have confidence that you're gonna make it i have confidence that we're not preaching in vain and the word going on there's nothing there glory to god praise god praise god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah glory give the lord a shout glory to god brother lyndon you're sitting there but you don't even know a vision came about you about ten years ago that you'll be here that you'll be back it looked hard it looked difficult but here you are god can't lie oh give the lord i shout glory to god if the vision is of god it will materialize oh glory to god nothing gonna stop the purpose of god i am watching visions come alive there's more to come there is more to materialize [Applause] glory hallelujah oh my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god it had to be a really emotional something for joseph to see his brothers come and all that they said it wouldn't do they were doing automatically they're bowing they're bowing they're bowing they're bowing jaws if they ask them to power and every knee shall power every tongue shall confess and prophet said the world will bow at the feet of men and women who cross [Applause] jordan this message is real but abram is dead and gone but the prophecy are dead and gone many man impersonating to take his place many men want to be the man of the or or kind of foolishness but there's a body bride around the world that god could take care of them [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's why when i go indian use of i stand in brother say listen i ain't committed to run no show to be no dis on that overall yeah i come to help all you support all you encourage all you but all you have to see what what god put all the here for i will not be answered for india for africa for europe all about the priests no just have head sometime like here are all the rascals i'll be here inside of here all the attitudes out of here that's what i'll answer for that's how to pump that word hallelujah that's my responsibility to find you out to throw the word at you see if we could hold it jesus wasn't asking they're ready he said the same as i do shall you do also and i'm going and cuss just now oh give the lord a shout hallelujah he said if you shall say to this mountain men no and all he goes let me be seated are they they come to jesus lord lord we see our man preaching your name and he's not with us shall we stop

belong to our group it's not a group thing [Applause] it's not a group thing there'll be two in a bed [Applause] one take and one left watch the preachers call the preachers on liver too if they can't live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons all right here was voices are we reading jesus a man of the hour our next prophet our next dis yeah what balance do we need how many is thousands of live voices that's not one one in thousands of live voices watch the thunder of god wait he said that turning out in sweetness holiness purity undefiled lives walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's the thunder against the enemy now let's hear what the devil is saying about this right yeah what are you saying you know the devil don't care how long you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or shout what hurts the devil what gets him upset what getting belly gripe what get him to retreat hallelujah what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil not when you're cussing your husband not when you're quarreling not when you're fighting and making war on the house that's a troy no devil did you ever sign in that he said come on now you could do it loud raise a little more keep fighting the flames of argument dispute debate people come in this year they're not talking about hallelujah hallelujah i can see the accusations you see that lord you see for yourself and they believe it that's what they say but look so when you sit down between all here he said this is my seat i have a right when you pull back and say wait some of this can work let me get all this foolishness devil have to take us leaving he can't stay there but the more you're carrying the foolishness is the more he not only sits he invites others to come and sit with him too all glory of god a house divided cannot stand [Applause] there is going to be a unity of the faith let me see if i could wrap up here i ain't finished half this thing oh let's continue you say well if he could preach like billy graham or auroba to somebody a great influential speaker sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing influential speaker that i even bring laughs watch this you get all the theology you want and all the seminary training devil has sit back and laugh at it but when he sees that life sees that life so now we want to go now in the spirit realm of what the devil sees oh let's continue so watch the disciples was down there the maniac child with epilepsy same comment of him never come out of him devil come on come on level come on endeavor devil sitting there said no aren't you making a pretty shame of yourself but ram is showing what the devil is saying to those disciples he said now he say no he said no watch now you see what you're doing jesus told you he commissioned you to cast me out and not one of you can do it but brother when they see him come jesus that is coming down the mountain walking quietly he didn't have to say nothing no spoken word necessary this is living word now and in this realm of the spirit is flashing lightning thunders voices shaking from a distance every devil in hell know what is walking oh give the lord a shout you can't make this up you can't pretend this you can't hide behind mysteries for this come on [Music] you come walking quietly he didn't have to say nothing the devil was already scared right then there's a man walking and that devil shaking now there's a man walking he said he's a preacher he said he's an elder yes

are we going to have that yes yes yes yes we're going gonna have it when the son of man cometh shall he find faith in trinidad yes yes he sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to defeat [Applause] so the mystery is not just in what is written it is what is in the back of the book the back of the book reveals the book the parts of the book have the voices the back of the book have the life the back of the book have the seven thunders and the seven thunders are the seven voices shake shake [Applause] shake [Applause] [Music] let me read it again he didn't have to say nothing that devil was scared right then he know he had to leave because here come my life not only a sermon but alive and that's why i keep hearing me saying over and over god is not adopting a sermon he's adopting the man who gives the lord some praises hallelujah glory to god so in the realm of the spirit hallelujah live voice not letter being spoken but the living word speaking the written word that is the thunder that shakes the devil because it will speak for itself oh glory to god hallelujah what abraham said behold no in the midst of the throne four beasts elders to the lamb have seven spirits of god sent forth to the early earth what is those seven spirits them seven messengers four verse seven the spirit become men who glory got seven messengers seven spirits seven men all glory to god every messenger

you have to be sealed the written word come to you the word is in you oh glory to god but the back path is the spirit path it's the voice part it's the thunder spot and that's why the devil fought it all these years fought the thunders oh glory to god there fought it fight it they're still fighting it but we still preaching it we still fighting for it there is something in us call of a second peter 1 427 because we have a revelation that this being when it's completed is the servant of god in the church of god that's going to rapture nothing is going the books and tapes not going into

trying to open up power over elements we're going back to eden we're going back to power we're going back to the manifestation of the sons of god muslims come up please i'm not finished but [Applause]

that jersey everybody will know you got it hallelujah listen it will testify for itself he god will let it be known among men not even you he will point you out this is my son you know [Music] [Applause] i escaped let me just one or two things i'll just wrap up here god's person if god acted any one time on a certain circumstance if that same circumstance arises again he's got to act the same way god's behavior is his person what he is in his behavior declares his person that's why the holy ghost can't be behaving one person and misbehaving another person because god's behavior is his person so when we talk about the person of christ we're talking about christ's own behavior in that person oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus all right i want to skip all of that noah was a sign of deliverances people a sign of judgment to the lost world the very water that choked the world drawn the world was the only means of saving noah say something softly the only thing that could save him was the judgment the only thing i'll receive the church today is the judgment i'm closing here but i believe the church is beginning to hear the message beginning to understand we have got to lay in the presence of the sun we have got to be ripened our fate isn't ripe so you can have hate but your feet could be green your feet want to be mature your feet need to be ripened you said no we are hearing the message of god give us and seeing the signs that he showed us and proven it by the bible in here but how the church needs to lay in his presence to lay and stay in his presence he said till it tenders up you know gets sweet in the spirit so it can be done sometimes speaking a message you got to get harsh but when the church once gets it the elected is called and separated then in the presence of god i know it'll be something like that the people was there when it takes the rapture final quote i skipped a lot of stuff this morning he said well if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer much time in prayer if you only knew what time in prayer meant sometimes when you were in prayer god changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen this boy has close eyes in the presence [Music] touching your gravel [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh
