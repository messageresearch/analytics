the spirited undefeated champion bo time on the field on this pewter champion Oh [Applause] [Applause] you gonna pray [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] god bless you good morning if you have a Bibles and lecture invite attention to Genesis 1 and sin Luke chapter 4 Genesis 1 I'll read verse 26 through verse 28 I'm sure the scripture we all know very well certainly many of us can really you know without eyes closed but let's go and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth amen syn look when it's you you know really pretty lengthen portion from there you know the Bible said that I got some Conda scriptures which I'll show you in a minute but the Bible said that Jesus Christ as a son lent obedience by the things that he suffered so Harry is one of those scriptures as a matter fact a major one where Jesus Christ is reigning obedience now when you see that when you read that it doesn't mean he was disobedient and then he he had to suffer to lend to know like that if you do know you you know that somebody means that's what it means it means that the things that is suffered the challenge is the things that came across his path his suffering his pains the circumstances he learned that obey the word under those circumstances really pays off every circumstance every challenge everything that happened let him understand was an experience was an opportunity for him to learn the way you obey the word those circumstances have got to obey the word also that's what it means amen so your challenges your circumstances is not a kill you but an opportunity to learn obedience to land that this world works this word every circumstance in my life will abate if I obey the word and let the word have his way the circumstances have no choice but to obey the word here's the master of every circumstance he speaks and every circumstance stands at attention the master is here watch how Jesus Christ as a son and is I example citizen how he learned obedience by every circumstance every pain every suffering every temptation every challenge so look for verse one array through 22 is the lengthen one but I'll try to run through it and Jesus been full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil those are the things he's suffered your temptations your sufferings amen I mean those days he did even nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto Him when he appeared most vulnerable if thou be the Son of God command these stones that will be made bread and jesus answered him saying it is written learning obedience to the word obeyed the word himself and took the word to apply to the situation to the temptation to the suffering knowing that every temptation every sin every situation will obey the Word of God and you are learning their obedience is better than sacrifice amen and Jesus said it is written the man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God the devil is not done yet your traditions are not done yet your challenges your sufferings are not your pins are not done yet and the devil take him up an high mountain should on to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time you know like you know flash in your mind your thoughts your thinking paths and your thinking process just shows you everything in a moment of camp what you could be how you can you know just just take a chance and compromise on that what a little bit or do something that nobody sees it you know just do something it doesn't matter a Kurd understands and the movement of time just shows him and in his mind in his thoughts because you're he presents you as a third God does and the devil also presents you as a thought amen and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is deliver and to me and to whomsoever I will I give it you think that they ever don't know scripture I will give them to you not just that and the glory of them now you know man had fallen from the glory of God so the devil was sniffing that this man here is come to restore man back to the glory of God so you wanted him to a king that pouria book because that Steve that that glory of God is not gonna be funny for him when man comes right back to that glorious Adam having the gun of Eden the devil knows he's in big trouble then you think the devil is in trouble now wait until adopted sons begin to rise up and the devil knows they called sleeves this man had a lot to do with it so exchanged one glory for another glory my glory is way down the road don't know that I'll give you this glory right now the glory of the majesty to own all of these things here everybody in the world worships you great temptation pain suffering do I do I not do I do I not but submit to the obedience to the world submission to the world under the control of the world father not my will but thine be done no I won't take what the devil's telling me I will take what your word says I'd be obedient to their word and he found strength and virtue once he submitted to the control of the world like that now what the gracious words that came out of his mouth and jesus answered and 17 get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve finding strength in the word for every one of your situations a man been in obedience to that will let the world step out of the way they really give both the prompts that they still learn how to get yourself out of the way and let the word way the what fight feed a champion of love amen verse nine not done yet more suffering and he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast doubt cast thyself down from thence from there just cast yourself down for and for it is written verse 10 he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee so is a war of courts now of course the devil lands fast here lent the thing that would you know you'll learn what you're opening doors people who do those things I'll get to in a minute people who do those things know like that you have to learn what the competition is doing and I can if he wins I mean and he's walking don't be don't don't be proud copy it as bona fide you can make it better and that's what the devil did here real powerful tactics so this thing is working against him this man is bringing in the world the world the world so let me also bring you the world so he went into the world not that he respects the one he has no respect whatsoever for the world but just the water got too used to manipulate too cheap to deceive that's what he was about but he modern marriage match this was not any man this was a man that had been trained to let obedience by the things that he suffers to know that every temptation every trial every pain every every circumstance that seem so calm against you is an opportunity by God to learn obedience to learn that the work does work that what God says he will do and when you learn this time around next time it becomes easier to believe that's what it is here these what works this word works amen so that there will begin a quote to war of course that's why we don't get into any oh of course in anybody but the Panem said it would believe it that's arrows eighty if we are still searching keep on searching move on man go on Simon we have found a man our resting place in the revealed Word of God sent from that from God through that great larger prophet malachi for for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee very smart you know all those things you remove something from me there is no other ways then you check this way I'm trying to jump from the pinnacle here father is this your way is this your will I want to be obedient to every word and go see my son not my way not my will but Jesus was the word himself and that's why you are getting to to keep thee removed in other ways and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone and Jesus answering said unto Him it is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and when the devil arraigned there is all the temptation he departed from him for a season but he learned some more things to know that this what works befits the devil any time under any condition even when you are weak and vulnerable like Jesus was it would always defeat the devil amen verse 14 and Jesus returning the power of the spirit into Galilee and then one of the fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and it came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the Prophet Isaiah's and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he anointed me to preach the are to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he left out on the day of vengeance of our God which in all those news Bible readers message students Obama because there was no is rightly dividing the world I'm making the word present tense because the day event declaring the day of vengeance was left to these end time bright and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them the one the synagogue were thrusting on him that's why I believe when you come a church leave all this side talk thrust in your eyes and him not the missile appropriate but the word that's been spoken because Jesus Christ is the mystery of God every word every mystery revealed amen and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witnessing now one that I have the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth amen I made a lot a displacement through enormous the only words richly bless you let's bow our heads what a pray our Heavenly Father thank you for this blessing our blended time of fellowship that you have been giving us these past few days I pray now Lord that your Holy Spirit will help each one of us here I pray will help me especially Lord as when they ever to go any award to bring a context to your people

really so but I can talk so I know if you are coming to preach you don't have this kind of chat oh my child is mine is one word control and and I got a few corner scriptures as more fact in all truthfulness they're more than a few hebrews 11:32 to 40 which is where you find the heroes of faith in the Bible for charm will fail let's talk of Gideon and Barack and all of that then also Colossians 1:9 29 white speaks about Christ in you the hope of glory and the Hebrews 5 verse 8 verse 9 what about as a son he learned obedience by the things he suffered and then revelation 3 in verse 21 he that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame I also overcame and I'm settling with my father in his throne amen my inspiration Christ in you the hope of glory and

again I'm just trying to talk to you and on this is a bit of control this morning now control that say what that are fun very intriguing for a long time especially as it comes and applies to you know Christianity I said this was in the message because we are all here we all about control now you may not understand I believe that but I let you see that in a few minutes we heard all about control that's why you were here that's one here that's why we get a church that's why we do the things that we do if we really mean to be in the rapture because you know what and and not just those were the message most any human being you see in Our Lives struggling for control it's even the business war you seen the spots war you see all over every facet of human existence you see men they're swimming

I don't of control I lie you know where this is coming from God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion control control it's in bill is in equating man this control you won't have dominion you want to protect your space are you can somebody relate can you relate that's that's words you can wriggle out of that even when you feel that the nicest person you let everybody have their way give her their space not true if a man made in God's image Christian unbeliever human control now when God made man he mainly mean its own image but like I said many times many times we want to make God in our image we want a God who will be in our image who would be like horse is only in our church our group that's God that's it got in your own image but God making man in His image you try to cope with him and clip with his word he doesn't have to look like your group every believer doesn't have to look like your group or your church but when it must be our group our church our pastor our deacons you gotta got in your own image that's not how I did it that made man in his own image he's not missed what we likes do you maybe see that just talking to your a man so this man image is premium the pitiful cannot even and give him three things brother branham said we do not know these things the prophet a great prophet right straight from the man of God William Bramley taught us these things now many times even this is this Commission area don't you ever formally think that this message is failing or that's a law there is nothing like that but if you ever let the devil get you to feel nothing is going on nothing is moving you are defeated you might as well go going home somewhere this measure is stronger now than it's ever been because studies get it ready maybe see that God Amen you are stronger today than you were yesterday I'm not talking about what you feel I'm telling you it no soul the devil is not scared of you today than it was yesterday amen so you'll be seated so God made man in his own image after his likeness but we wanted God in our image after our likeness what we like and then we'll find the court on the scripture to make God Satan to me by the pen I'm sage that's a God in your own image so when God made these men brother branham Taurus you bring from the scriptures and let us see it that God give this man three things because when he fair is that Adam lost three things number one he lost his fellowship with God number two he lost it alive and number three in his eternal life he lost an inheritance a man in his eternal life now let me explain something to you here fellowship with God is a right as a son of God eternal life is this a right understand of God you don't have to do anything extra to earn eternal life a listen of God neither do anything extra to and fellowship with your father even in the natural and natural your son what is a good boy or a bad boy he's your son he has access to you all the time amen it has your life flowing through him well I'd assume that boy too late your life is flowing through him same way with God can somebody say Amen the devil is not much glory because greater more powerful is he that is a youth and the devil in the wall lying to you try to stop y'all but he cannot do it you cannot do it the other pure virtual sinless para Jesus Christ and amen amen you maybe see that trying to keep it up on my time here because some of us I'll triple a key I need some training because break a judge in less than one hour put me on that prove it what he doesn't one hour I'm doing four hours I mean unless we have much what now he really yes back he used to be remember the chip was preaching he was a leader in that department I'm but she was pitching you know the time by this sweat even though our old church you know you know heat so and one much avoid speeding when he sweat over here no he's gone two hours when it's gone to the Lexia you know he's like four hours and I said I'm only just getting started so we get a preamble I get leg us some time to Train us how to get your point through in one hour I'm sure they put Legos would love that very much oh yeah no don't tell me you won't love that I can see you how you look at your watch alright and you're making like lyonia I see all that come on Legos you're an Abba together for too long I know that but I okay you got to come with me but the Chivo brother talks and Fergie brother Moses when it comes here it's from Legos we have got to put in there what there or something you know what everybody was in family is doing 50 minutes but don't be scared I won't keep you for hours and that's what the cheapo stuff you know so I was behind him in that department and but the talks would do it in both talks but I'll do it in one hour half hours but they serve that cheap when I working all the time so they upgraded they upgraded two meters up you know so wouldn't lead them to long so but talk to the spiritual so anyway got mid Manny's image again these three things and when man fell he lost these three things so we know from there he had these three things before he fell fellowship eternal life and inheritance in his talent now then here John we say but what it was was the authority the power the control over the earth that was the inheritance your son is your son but you know where you are right in your wheel to give your children the inheritance it depends on certain things and brother bidam Taurus in God's economy that son has got to be the right kind of as soon because this inheritance is powerful these returns placing on the same level as God himself so you have got to be the right kind of a strong firstly before he will give you this inheritance in life now Adam did not how to prove to be the right kind of a son because God made Adam not a channel but a male in his own image made him mature perfect men include image as though he had go through the process to be the right kind of a son I gave this inheritance in life but when Adam sinned unfair they lost all three and God immediately because Adam is shown is a son you can do anything about that goddess in the forces children he will never divorce you no matter how beaten up how black and blue you up in Vietnam he will never divorce you if you can just find your way back to the cross you will find your way back home but devil can keep you and put a wet believer your father you know always was a son you always will be a son hallelujah glory you may be seated but the the thoughts in the the inheritance in life got in Norridge topic immediately you restore the frost to those wise who writes as a soon it not to be the right kind of soul not to be any type of Sun it's in a life flush with his father but the inheritance is the only given to the right care of children with God felt Adam here built Adam up to that smoker when Adam fell said no this is no longer the right kind of song I cannot him that will that inheritance to have my two main to himself alone I cannot give him that but I restore back his inheritance I mean iris took back his fellowship is eternal life you'll never be lost you'll always be my son and so from that time the church has been how to come back to that inheritance that's supreme control on the face of the earth that's why you and I have this craving for control on the instead of us we want to come back to rulership we want to come back to sonship we want to come back to social Authority to speak and our water back just like that [Applause] amen glory so follow my story so that's where the craving to come from God send man out I'm gonna say I'm not going to restore this control they didn't how it turns back to you until I see you and see you under the control of the one who proved to be the right kind of a song amen and when I see that I will call you a shy give you three more words here is my son much Spearing freely and that's always Tamia like for the OVC last night Amen cause original plan for a mantis 10 like the original mannequin of Eden possession on Timothy 20 spoken what authority power to control the earth total all the elements amen am i against the amen amen so when Adam fail brought us back to this spot here and that's why I said you mean all of us something on instead of us look longing for control you see it everywhere you see in your home life you see it at school you should be doing husband and wife you see within the children it's in the business world the husband wants a control his wife do I want to control the children the joy to control their parents what must happen to a husband this general control that church this must want to control the whole church control it's man of us it's part of who we are amen but we we have got control figured at wrong big-time big-time because God is a God of control gaara's didn't listen to just hang everywhere a God of control but the devil has put a battle rap on that what control it means like you any prison means they control everything you do it means you can do anything you are just heading there and you just have to like stay in a straitjacket no that's what we think but that's all have got TDT how did Adam get here to have these three things it's an alive fellowship and inheritance how did you get there you have to go all the way back to this grid three four mystery which is Christ in you the ultimate abilities Christ in you to put Christ in you and give you hope for that glory that Adam had in the can of Eden Lorie boy are you following me alright the preachers of preach so um and I hope I'm not too fast as by etching will you come with me he said no and I am preaching and I'm generally the brothers dealt with here of his league in this place here here so they have to rearrange the hall to accommodate my pitching staff you will think I will lend so when I went there I was very conscious now like that you've got to be measured and speak really slow so and I thought I did my best my best one fresh pitch in my fridge that's the brother the chance the height I do was it okay beside he said you killed me I fell on his neck I said I'm so sorry brother you know so but let's see now I understand I understand well you know I didn't get to help this year it's God's great 3/4 mystery which was God having the preeminence ease the continues over Christ by the word and correct all past haven't control by his word over the brown call it preeminence ease but it's control controlling the bread lab rat learns to obey the word all the time and here's a secret when you learn to be something to the world every second miss around you will lend the same thing to the circumstance around you cannot stand against the watch the what will create a hole in the wall if there must be hole in that wall Oh hallelujah [Music] no three for me she's not just catch phrase because I hear these days L name logos bright that's fine but don't take the water out of context Malakai him and reveal what the three four machines nobody needs to shed more light on it nobody's to explain anyway hello him logos bright what it means is that Elohim God having premises and control over Christ the bright the word and Christ having privileges over you the bright and number three is not the bright is Christ and the bright - in fact readin which is crashing you the hope of glory amen amen so here's the secret here so they can live even in the game of Eden here was Adam block out of the theophany in the beginning made his spirit man on the face of the earth and here was Adam spirit man Adam and later Genesis 2:7 this female was put in the body of flesh and man became a living soul and this man Adam went open down the gun Avedon in the image of God with absolute control over the earth God was the god of the universe but his son Adam was the god of the earth in absolute control over the earth but how that worked how that works which you know but also repeated to you how that was that God had control over Adam and so Adam could control the earth one had to come first God her to have preeminence is over Adam first and control over the earth automatically followed that's what we don't follow signs don't look for signs signs follow the believer the believer has come to preeminence ease has come to control by the word amen amen amen amen so Adam there he was in total complete subjection to God on his world the world in his soul Sharon split of Elohim in his soul Genesis 1:26 to 28 with a command Commission to subdue to rule to control the earth and so Adam was under the control of God and because of that you could control the but the very moment the very moment that Adam went away from the control of God the very minute like brother Delia things are said like that nothing happened when Eve you know these would be nothing happening and you watch brother banner be always about when Adam fell when Adam still win Adam failed once Adam soul or his birthright and God lost control over Adam immediately Adam lost control of the earth it was instant to tell you it out of that days you will die and he's gently odd I knew something change something change on the spur Adam knew that you know we all love control I mean you get adopted and you won't love it you'll be happy that's all they ever knew have you ever thought about Adam before Eve came on the scene the only man on the face of this earth no fellowship no way to grow no matter who is father and mother and you know laying things no no nothing he was just alone and then go MIDI for him and they had fellowship with God and it was in absolute control over the earth touch all over the earth but once he did this sin and listen to the devil in the form of this happen through his wife Gold lost control over Adam and rather the symptom instantly that I'm lost control over the earth you cannot eat a cake and have it Eve God be God 7 so like we all do something wrong so he he tried it again he snitched on me one Orleans but you will know you know you will know when something but you know so he tried to like this to remove this way I moved away nothing happened try to access that control like before I want to walk on the water and if I were himself sinking he run back you know that contain was gone away from him I noticed that he was naked which wasn't an issue before he looked at his wife she's naked he knew these not proper so he went right away to try and get that control back let's do something let's do something no that's how we are we never admit until we up into the world do we up into the wall and we have to are forced to admit but instead of falling man don't do that so you went and the fig leaves uncovered himself on his swim so you see here also Easter I begin my free with means something went wrong he you know like like something you stretch in front of the power is gone just kick off the cheetah should I call me actually I just many which I just look who's talking it doesn't its way it's a lion come here the general straddle the of a tiger just coming like that graceful like that I'm started getting afraid he said no something's going on here I gotta hide these animals will cheer me up I gotta hide from all these animals because they with the earth they had the latter rule he got afraid he said I was afraid so I hid myself fear came in he was afraid with lots of control his war just turned upside down that's why you are now on control control put stays in place control gets you in order control set things the way you think you want them to go like Adam when we feel out of control we just don't feel right because God made us to control to be the controller on the earth so when we feel out of control that's another subject while we feel out of control I just want to you know stay here on you know Genesis and Adam you know I'm selling out to the devil through his wife's reasoning the Adam wasn't deceived when you feel out of control when you feel not in control things just don't feel right unlike Adam we kept control wrong Adam to fix this pyramid we also control look at what he did look at what he did it made figleaves wrong action God came down Adam Wainwright now he said I had the vault work in the garden and I was afraid of all these animals running around here and me I don't strong and I hit myself wrong action but Adam who - you - you were naked have you eaten the food that I did simple answer yes simple answer yes Adam said yes but an explanation not a laughing matter my mother and said you know it's because of the woman that you yourself gave me I was in fine you know I still maintain I didn't fall without her well you give it to me you give it to me wrong action simple answer yes but what he was doing he was he did wrong he was caught red-handed but the blame is not mine alone out of control playing the blame game it's my wife it's my husband it's my brother is my sister is the pastor is Julian oh come on now come on now [Applause] Bhavana me Nigeria okay I mean I did this is on top for me so I know that's why I went but always come around wasn't that trouble is coming because he can see things that you know of course whatever but you know I don't mean to be controversial I apologize about that up front but I don't like living in denial I don't like delicious even myself I'd like to call it spirit spade and if I'm wrong and wrong I can get over your head and because your pastor is talking you can keep quite both boys not gonna keep quiet they don't respect no possible response children and bumps are going to be tabla sincere anyway so Adam put a blend in you know what it was like everybody is wrong because of what you are done you can never talk to what you did anyway you own up everybody must take a blame for it because you felt out of control the blame game the victim mentality everybody's against me if not for my wife if not for my husband if not for the church even though for the country if not for the press that has been everybody for second sense because he feels was totally out of control and we got control wrong totally figured out wrong lost control we want to get it back and Dan wants us to get it back so how do we get control back O'Reilly what's the right way to get back this control how do we can control right we go back to God to go back to God he's the devil country he said in the Bible let everything be done decently and in order God dwell all by himself thoughts in his mind and became the logos well he wasn't of the logos quit at Angel's the word quit at angels angels worshipped him and when angels watched them then those are rewarded heavens son there's no panic in heaven the word he's in control is that gutter control things go wrong it was all well thought out it's all English program things can never go wrong nothing can go wrong but what God would allow it and the word control that they will control it war in heaven through Lucifer out and he's 1/4 of angels and human our wine heaven became human battles and got him on the earth and created the heavens and the earth the god of order and control I wish I had the picture to show you the the great universe that he created but let me give you statistic the skies the heavens boughs it declared some men declare the glory of God and the firmament shows his handiwork and in the stands that you see at night they are billions and billions and billions of them many of them are bigger than our earth and those tears are on planets and it grew a planet's from a galaxy I mean galaxy has its own and the planet it run that strong now our own galaxy our own galaxy and most of these galaxies are spinning around me now we don't feel it because of God's great wisdom but this earth this earth is an and the galaxy the way in is spinning around at the breakneck speed of four hundred and ninety thousand miles an hour these are galaxies this this Galax that were in it spin around spin around spin run for an eight thousand miles an hour we don't feel it and even have that great breakneck speed to for our God to make one single rotation you don't have many years on it it wouldn't at least two hundred million years for our galaxy to make one single nation around the Sun and God keeps all that they're absolutely controlled in order of them I go and run like that are the wrong things in space by his word here's what keeps him on the check his word is the controller that controls all of this news and keeps them in their space Laury Laury the ecology and you know what you know what that but over a billion all the galaxies not planets over a billion other galaxies out there like our galaxy uncle where are these happens on the earth and the hanging space there at this speed Ranelagh I don't right he's a God of order I have is not run under control and it control them by his world are you following me control him by his world and this Great God come right down to you and I and could it Adam in the Garden of Eden this great God what is man that thou art mindful of him or the Son of man that you will visit him acquainted man in the Caribbean and put amen the same way he wants to control this man and brother Panem Toros and you know when he came down gen 1:26 that was God coming down this control tower in Adam at the control tower was bad the word the seven spirits of God in Adam soul and in the physical do you see this control of God right down to everything that God knows is a God upon saw in Adams body your body is so controlled so controlled you have a control center in your head control the whole human body every cell has a control center everything is so controlled he's a glad of control and that control bring some order so God so God when he gave Adam to control the earth he was sitting right on Adam strewn in Adams heart with his control tower it chose man's had to be his control he was seated there in the form of his seven spirits and Adam was subject to this control and then the earth was tomato Adams control Amen glory to God a man can you share hallelujah are you following our story it's a beautiful story of redemption now like I said the devil gives a rap went about control I wish I'd want to control me it's very young people you want to control me I'll lose my freedom they'd let me watch them what I do know here was God controlling Adam in the Garden of Eden God was absolutely in control watch in this control like by the daily preach and choices watch in this control in this control why did God tell Adam of all the truth you go eat but this one don't eat but it's your choice I give you a choice not inside God's control got left room for a choice that for Adam to be or not to be for Adam to obey or not obey that's why so we get control one number one we control you get a do it yet parents control that children you know do the same do this here all God didn't do that the controller is not your word those priests of us when don't respect your word the respected mascots word is the same don't control your children but God controlling his son Adam he told him this is what I'm going to do but if you choose the other way no their consequences with your choice so God's control leaves a room for a choice I know why you know why nobody grows on the very controlling atmosphere nobody goes why you Anna Church everything is control sit down stand up you can't even think for yourself when you're at home sit down turn up okay you do this here the church the pastor deacons do this here and the pastor's get away to take it away from them and do everything by himself and they the deacon you know you will never grow the same way in a home somewhere at home when you don't give the people a chance to be I'm not to be too to grow to make the mistakes to learn that's what choices are there the process of choices lets you go through thinking it through if I go this way if I go this way these are the consequences if I go that way these are the consequences just talking to you and I hope you are listening if I go this way these are the consequences if I cross out the consequences no I will go this way and not that way and in that process is a maturing process through the thinking process that's why God gave us choices to think through your choices and in control he lets us have room to be or not to be it doesn't crowd out our space so it's a lie when the devil says husain is all about controlling you control the people's minds no in cost system of control you have a choice to obey or not to obey in the damaged stem of control he gives you no choice even why you don't want to do wrong he forces you to do wrong you know like the prodigal son is the I don't like any Sonia too much controlling this woman here I'll go to my father say father I'm tired of this control here I'm gone an Italian said no you're not going proving that he was wrong in the first instance father let him go and the control he was getting the way from run away from from his father didn't meet away went didn't meet the control he went on was so all his substance it was free freedom to do what he wanted to know this control gives you freedom not to live like a freedom to do the right thing freedom to shun the wrong and do the right thing that's God's control and you'll give you a chew on that simple opportunity to have the choice to do the right thing or do the wrong thing when they get to that age of accountability if the choice is the choice Oh glory to God amen amen so Adam when he sinned and he lost control you were gonna pet the control right back I need two wrong things and that's like I said that's what we all do we want control and we do the wrong things it becomes my way or the highway makes a domineering dominant you know nobody must be our way and no other way that's not God's we have control and you'll never come to adoption like that no you will never Oh glory I'm not making sense I'm almost done I'm almost done so God will learn for me how this control comes about can I have the first my first picture there all right hello him have thoughts on his mind and that makes sense right and then Elohim pour these thoughts into a body called the logos a body like this body but with the better scene it's supernatural body and all that and these thoughts narrowing became what seats in the loggers Adam was it funny narrow him you wait for the narrow him I was a sudden arrow him so what God in Genesis 1:26 was he took Adam seed in the logos viruses got created man in his own image of that seed he created a perfect man and that became the spirit man in Genesis 1:26 228 and you were still there as a throat a seed what in the Lourdes and what Adam was to do was so standing in the time of season call you out and here you would have come God take your seat from the loggers and this is your seed and your serum your seat on your seed and God took it out and created the purpose of creation that's the only the quitter that can do that that can take a seed and walk in and form it into the image of God seven perfect spirits that's what it did in Genesis 1:20 2018 Genesis 1:26 was not a feel funny it was a you're funny seed that was created and fashioned into the image of God and then Genesis 2:7 it took that spirit man put a flasher on him but this you're funny this seed was Adam soul and put a flashing on him I'm just used to seven says go from man just one twenty six was the creation that's the equation this happens on the inside and then from man on the face of the earth no man can do the Christian on the inside only God but man can do the forming on the outside like public charge was talking about the Nigerian doctor they can work on the flesh they can work on the body they can American shadow to a prosthetic limb and you have things they can cottonseed up but no man can cut open heal the soul only God can do the walk of creation on the inside next picture this was Adam before the fall in his soul was seven perfect spirits that was a spirit man and that's when I was a control tower the control tower was not Adam it was the world got controlling by his word and I was under the control of the ward in his soul and man just became a living soul when he put flesh on him the so the what image lived out through the flesh man became a living soul well watch it when Adam fell what happened I don't you need to understand this you know what the battle has been for you and I the devil knew with the word madam soul he has no chance so what he did he came and began to attack his spirit it ever can never get your soul began to attack his spirit where you have the affection memory reasoning imagination conscience began to attack it has God said to reason of the world got said if God said no that's not what it is here this was the controller the world in the soul and he speaks the spirit listens it speaks the body listens and man became a living soul the soul lived through this flesh this spirit could not stand in the way but the devil came and succeeded in getting me here and government to reason the word has God said no God hasn't said and all that and then when man fell he fell short of the glory of God this was the glory of God inside and this glory of goemon's fell this really became shortened it came from being a stature or the fullness became a little seed in his soul the control tower was with the usually a little seed and the devil got in here introduced another control tower to began to reason the word so after the fall the control tower the what image became a little seed and thus a man have seen and fallen short of the glory of God the glory of God you're funny in seed form in your soul seven perfect spirits the nature of God in your soul the fall became reduced because man fare reduce to this little protein amen so the control tower did not did no longer have the power that he had to control the spirit and the flesh because the devil got in here with his own control Lucifer's control tower the human mind which is your brain to reason things out can you say Amen amen so brother sister that's been our story can give me the third one I'm almost done really all right that's been our story this your human mind the brain the physical brain is the body but that is the spirit that makes you work and that's with your human mind so the human mind works with the brain and like I explained before right here is your emotions right there the front of the brain is where you have the reasoning and when you live in your human mind at the level of your human mind what you are doing is that your reason and your emotions at work all the time all the time the control tower is to shut up your soul is no longer controlling like that when you are living in the humanistic realm your soul which is the control tower for God instead of shut up and this is the devil's control tower your reasoning and your emotions your intellect you select your mind you read the Bible and then your intellect your mind know this can happen the doctors say that can never happen and all of that I know what you you can check this out not me saying that because all your sensations come through here emotions are given an upper hand all the time when you stay at this level here your emotions will always win against your reasoning that's why when you know you know something is wrong to do while your emotions get you so under control so angry you know I should be angry like that your emotions we know the time between your emotions and your wrist your intellect your emotions you are wired the originals will get the upper hand all the time so when the fall happened the devil religious to live at this level what emotions versus your reasoning have God said yes and no gods say we shouldn't do it but no you will become whatever and he put his hand in here the emotions felt good and the motions versus your reasoning the motions are given an opera hand all the time whatever controls your emotions controls you so for a man that's his teeth and God said I will not give you back that inheritance in life until I can get men back to the spot to where the control tower will be set back in his heart in that had compartment and that controls how we control the intellect will control the emotions control the body like it did in Adam before the fall that's been the Gospel story to get mom back to that spot to where God can take charge again and control your reasoning control your emotions control your flesh body that's been the Gospel story and that's why I sent you a prophet a man you may be seated glory now can it send it back to the picture before this one right so here we are these where we are headed for but this is where we are when we come in to this world a little seed in our seed of God is a little seed but it's not the control tower normal the control is taking place here from your reason and emotions than your flesh and your your insulation and all the time your emotions always win because that's why man has become like one of us to know good and evil and he said to him that knows what is good and does it not to image sin that's how we seen you know good and you don't do it because your emotions control you they catch your your feelings Frost and they guide what you do we act and then think little so that's been the wall but when you become a Christian when become a believer this sit in the soul is walking up and that is Johnny to go back here we are going back where we fell from they will not leave you comfortless is that I will come again he will come and save you said to the weary one your God has Charlie come he will come and save you or let's drive it home now and go out of here glory you may be see the glory so when you become a Christian this Syriac went out Gus control tower begins to come back into the human soul because God controls by his world not by the parents words not by the pastor's words by his words they control the universe all of those galaxies are there by his words he doesn't cry over them like a helicopter it is the Sun staining his flesh is this wondering then don't know his word because what has not power in itself amen to make this pass on the moon and the Sun and the galaxies to hang in their spaces this one has the power why one does not have the power to keep your children our control to keep the reason your children under control Laura glory you may be seated just talking to you so goods in the process of taking control but over Adam when Adam is totally again under the control of God the earth will automatically commander Adams control will be back here will be back here seven perfect spirits the image of God the what image in Adams soul undaunted into his flesh again and man will go up and down the earth again like Adam just see the Lord or keep still and that's what the devil fights that word so bad he pollutes the water he dilutes the word interpreter word but thank God down through the ages we have examples examples of heroes in the Bible who correct dreams of the water God clear for the day and age even in the Old Testament and this was selling their soul and had them under total control and when this word is in the soul and after that control the flesh is subject circumstance and run is subject this one in the soul masters every circumstance hallelujah let's call some on the scene Moses the prophet Moses then he was is been spoken about in this village I don't have to go through all of that for hell was Moses at the Red Sea God atolan lie below his fellows then come back and watching me on this

seated for a few announcements amen servius continues at 3:00 p.m. at 3:00 p.m. doors will open at 2:30 p.m. this evening so we set three rows of them at 2:30 p.m. this is a new month happy September happy new month and with this new month but all that has been led to turn up the heat as it were so from this week there'll be no more felicity night services we want to have services coming Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and we want to really encourage you to make an effort for some of you if you could come straight from work that works if you want to carpool that works but make an effort Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. it will be a live reaching service and this coming Friday at 7:30 p.m. as well we want to come back into the house of God and I really want to encourage especially the young people to make an extra effort to be in these services you have more opportunities to be in the house of God and this by God's grace is also Scripture as the day approaches that we are to gather together more frequently so we want to really put some more commitment and effort to this and going forward our order of services will be Sunday mornings at 10:00 a.m. Wednesday nights at 7:30 p.m. and Friday nights at 7:30 p.m. and invite somebody out testify to somebody but the random said if you don't testify you'll find yourself back stood in one name you know it should be part of your everyday walk to talk about Jesus talk about his goodness and but around us and we are all preachers it doesn't require coming into the pulpit but your life is a testimony as we heard that powerful testimony from a young man that British Stephen impacted and it's a life if we're this even was just seeing words and the love was not being expressed that a young man will pick it up because they are looking for reality but the love that was this was displayed or express to what time was so compelling that it it warranted a response and that's how we we ought to be you know I'm on the expectation friends because we are leaving this place and I can't wait to go I can't wait to get out of this sinful world but we also have a job to do before we leave here because the body of Christ has been hurt and affected we have lost young people we have lost different ones but we are not leaving them behind before we leave here we will see a restoration of the young people we will see a seventh underpriced revival before we leave here we're not leaving here sick nobody's leaving here the press we've got to let the devil know as we bought a rap to express we made it and but the brandon said when you get over there you look around and see people are you'll wonder how they made it what is the grace of God it's the unfeeling amazing grace of God and the Prophet said the head store will come with shoutings crying grace grace grace unto it so I encourage you pray more than you've ever prayed before I encourage you worship more than you ever worship before with Apollo and check her one time said do something different if you if you used to raising one hand raise two hands if I used to pray in half-an-hour pray for 45 minutes but whatever you do do something more because whatever more you do it's a more results you're gonna get in your school do more you get more results in your Christian walk two more you get more results in your marriage two more you'll get more results in your prayer life two more you'll get more results in your reading read more you get more involved in your worship worship more you get more results is that what you're looking for more results in every area of your life as but Allah said in yours caught in Scripture in all things pertaining to life and godliness come to church shame and so I look forward to seeing you here this Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and Friday at 7:30 p.m. and we asking the choir members just stay back for a very short meeting after service and maintenance group 4 please meet with brother Marlon Alexander after the second service and last and certainly not least we have delayed this for some time but we do want to take care of this so next Sunday after service we will have our post convention meeting which we should have had a while ago so it is asking all those who are involved in operations on planning for the convention to please repair your reports your comments your suggestions so as we prepare to boot wrap up this year and what quad will have for us next year will be more prepared by the grace of God so me the Lord richly bless you archers deacons brother Anthony just want to get a word to the parents and try to encourage your parents to get a burden considering your children I know enough school and college and different things like that but that sometimes could be a real excuse you need to put God first have a burden to put God first and see things we hold so smoothly and one time I had a family and he was always busy doing stuff doing stuff doing the stuff and make an excuse about study and school and whatnot when his results came it wasn't that hard and we all and the guy who got it once he was in sports he was an all a man of things so he was a big question how come you don't have all this activity and this guy have all this activity and still to perform it's interesting it's just what you put your heart to what you put your mind to and if you change your attitude in your thinking like I recognize some in the press services I don't see young much young people at all and I wonder why somebody young people I don't know if they could even pretty think about it now we want them to be able to pray we want them to if they don't know that they will learn to pray that we could get them to learn to pray and get involved in cinah would a prayer and we want to see that so I want you to know that things are changing we're gonna keep our finger on the reset button I think everything is reset and get it just right so when your miss service don't be a phenom be a surprise if they get a phone call to ask why squirty but we're gonna keep that button down until everything is reset so things are gonna change and you have to change what change middle or bless you see you this evening presently oh god will make go and where there seems to be no way [Music] away [Music] oh it's true for each new we will where [Music] Oh God [Music] where there seems to be no [Music] we'll make way
