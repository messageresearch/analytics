as we continue now we commit ourselves and your word and this time into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] amen the Lord bless you church I will take time to greet you as I should but another not to keep you standing I will suggest we read the Bible so you can take the comfort of your seats we welcome ourselves again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ please if you have your Bibles with you I would like for you to turn with me to the Book of Luke chapter 10 we shall read from the book of Luke and we shall also take from The Book of Joshua Luke chapter 10 I would like to read from verse 30 to 35 30 30 3535 sometimes you have to speak for both ways because some understand it as 30 some call it 30 all right if you are there say [Music] amen and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which striped or stripped him of His Garment and wounded him and uh departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise the Levites when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as he Jour it came where where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an in and took care of him and on the tomorrow when he departed he took out two pens and gave them to to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee amen let's please turn to the Book of Joshua Joshua chapter 2 we want to look at uh one of our shadows in the scripture tonight Joshua chapter 2 I would like to read from verse 8 to 17 and I'll pick few more verses from Joshua chapter 6 and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof and she said unto the men I know that the Lord had given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the hamit that we on the other side Jordan seon and OG whom he utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain anymore courage in any man because of you so meaning that they believed what they heard for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have shown you kindness that ye will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and that you will save Al life my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from and the man answered her our life for yours is our business and he shall be when the Lord had given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with the then she let them down by a C through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you up get you to the mountain let the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there 3 days until the pursuers be returned and afterward you go your way amen finally thank you for bearing with me Joshua chapter 6 I will take verse 10 16 17 and 18 verse 10 16 17 18 and Joshua had commanded the people saying shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I be you shout then shall he shout verse 16 and it came to pass at the seven time when the priest blew with the trumpet Joshua said unto the people shout for the Lord had given you the city and the city shall be ACC even eat and all that are there to the Lord only R the allot shall leave she and all that are with her in the house because she heits The Messengers that we sent and ye in any wise keep yourselves from their caused thing lest you make yourselves ACC caused when you take of the ACC caused thing and make the camp of is a cause and trouble it may the Lord had his blessings to the reading of his holy word God bless you you may be seated I would like to thank the Lord very much tonight for giving me this privilege to stand before the Believers in this part of the country at this time I so much thank God for the opportunity I would like to appreciate the gesture of our their Pastor here brother Char for uh giving me this opportunity to stand before the believer to be of service trusting God that along the line can be of a blessing I would like to appreciate all the Servants of the Lord that both behind me here and in the audience for all the support that you have given and the ones that I will enjoy tonight I appreciate the Servants of the Lord who have spoken for the grace to yield themselves to God to bring such Mighty blessings unto us I want to assure them that we can never be the same again after such wonderful times that we have enjoyed through their ministration may the Lord bless their labor and let them bring forth many fruits that will abide so we appreciate Pastor AK brother Pastor rmon Thompson [Applause] Thomson I was privileged to see Pastor the in Maracas there's a beach called Maracas in three and Tobago and my host thereor makes it a duty even if I spend the weekend it will take me there for B and [Music] Shar so in one of our B and Shar trip I was privilege to meet with him and we had a good hand shake and get a little appointed but I never knew he was there until just a while ago during the service may the Lord bless you sir [Applause] well I don't know who Pastor mua was talking about a while ago but all the same if that is meant to be me I want to say I do not deserve any bit of that but I appreciate the kindness of his service to think that much of [Applause] and I pray that the Lord will bless you richly God bless every one of you who taking time of your Shadow to be part of this me all the sacrifices that you have made I pray that the Lord will repay it very greatly to the glory of His holy name the Lord bless you amen and uh I bring greetings from home Pastor sends greetings so do the people back at home in the church the ministers the officers all the congregation told us to give their greetings like has been said I came with some of the we're just happy to be with the Saints here this time for Fellowship also my wife and children also told me to give theirs everyone is doing fine by the grace of God and I'm sure they'll be happy to know that the Believers are you will just indulge me to recognize the pastor Martin [Applause] pastor there are men under whom we have grown it's a big support for me to see them in the audience God bless everyone of you God bless the Servants of the Lord tonight if the Lord will be our help which I trust you will I would like to speak on a subject which I called the making of Jericho's cause Jero became aaed that's what we want to look [Music] the Lord Jesus Christ was given the parable in the Book of Luke chapter 10 I'd like to let you know that it was Christ himself speaking and in this Parable was talking of a man who was traveling wrong direction the Bible said he was going from Jerusalem to Jero Jero a normal Journey should always be from Jero Jalem don't worry you will appreciate it as we go on but a normal Journey should be a direction from from Jericho J to Jerusalem Jerusalem Jerusalem is on the hill if you travel to Israel even physically by geography you can't travel into Jerusalem you are sent into Jerusalem is on the hill while Jericho is in the valley so people should when you are traveling from Jerusalem going to Jericho you are descending or you are condescending but when you are going from Jericho to Jerusalem you are ascending I like the song I like the song that says I'm pressing on the upward Way new HIDs I'm gaining still praying as I'm onward bound Lord plant my feet on but the case of this man of this brother instead of going from Jericho to Jerusalem he was coming from Jerusalem to Jericho he was traveling on a wrong direction why was it the wrong direction because Jerusalem is the city of the Blessed why while Jericho is the city of the ca you cannot be leaving blessing and accepting a cause you must be moving out of your causes amen whether generational or individual and going into blessing so for a man to be doing a reversal of trip it's a wrong direction and I see want to tell you tonight that Jericho has got nothing for you because we shall find out what Jericho is tonight it has got nothing for you if you will ever be blessed at all you must come into Jerusalem and every true Seed of Abraham Longs for Jerusalem because it was their father's teaching to long for Jerusalem If Abraham never left anything at all for his generation he left them the the Legacy the inheritance of Jerusalem it was the mark of the beginning of the Journey of Faith when the Lord told Abraham to leave the land of the childes to a land that he was going to show him God had that place in mind he was going to show in Jerusalem because it is in Jerusalem that Resurrection will take place it is in Jerusalem that oh friends Hallelujah even do you know that your Eternal place of is going to be on that same [Applause] spot you are not going to live eternally in heaven no no no no we are going to live eternally on the earth and because you are the Bride of Jesus Christ it is the good desire of your god of your husband to give you your AB Bo in the capital city that's right I want the church to know that there is going to be degree in eternity you are not going to live as a second class citizen in eternity but whether you agree with me or not there will be second class citizens in eternity you don't believe that there will be second class citizens it is not a slip of tongue I said it so you can coach me I said there will be second class citizens in eternity but I believe tonight I'm speaking to First Class [Applause] delegate let me tell you the blessings of first class delegates they are going to have a rapture they will be there they will be in the wedding supper they will enjoy the Millennium and when eternity comes they will live inside for S [Applause] City but second class citizens they will make Heaven quite all right but they will never make it by Rapture am they will miss the Millennium they will miss the wedding supper and they will never live inside the four S City that's right there will be Nations around the city and they have got to have Kings over them Hallelujah where you living every day Hallelujah they will not be able to come inside it is only their King that will come in once in every [Applause] cycle and when there come on in every cycle the only svir they will take maybe from your own garden the Tree of Life leaves just the leaves just the leaves to go and show to their subjects here we have healing there will be no more war there'll be no more problem we are together permanently but that is all they could enjoy of the first quar city aren't you a privilege [Applause] people whether you take it figuratively as the Heavenly Jerusalem don't forget it will be here or you accept it as the Heavenly Jerusalem on Earth it will be here and that is what make Jerusalem the city of the Blessed would you want to leave that for something else so what do you think of this man here who was leaving Jerusalem I'm coming into Jericho a city of those that are caused he was [Applause] backsliding let me say this very well this land of Israel or Jerusalem or Palestine or Canaan for God to get it for the people of Israel it cost God a lot the Redemption of that land wasn't cheap pharaoh and his army had to perish in the Red Sea because they tried to stand on the way is that right the Waters of Jordan had to open up God had to create water from The Rock he had to send Man From Heaven he did so many things waved every Supernatural because he wanted to give his people an inheritance and because the the Redemption wasn't cheap that was why God commanded every true Israelites that no matter what happened don't leave that land because it's my god-given land to you stay in there and when times are bad when times are good those who have heed that instruction have always come out Victorious now me and his family disobeyed that instruction you know what they came up with by the testimony of Nami she said I went out full but I came back empty meaning that God wants you to stay there [Applause] there no matter what happen stay there because that is the city of your blessings let's follow this man when he left that place the prophet said for us to have our ground today he said we have a ground today called the secret place of the most high and this ground is the ground of the message of the hour and then we are also under instruction from the message invisible Union brother Bram was talking about it he said the pilgrim fathers were looking for a land where they could have freedom of worship he said but today spiritually speaking God has given us that land and he say you and I must stay in there because that is the part to Eternity now this great economy of God uh I do not have a board here so we can call it like a ring here like a circle I always use this as a type why because eternity brother Braham said is like a ring now you are not called to stay outside you are told to stay inside is that right now the power of the church is as long as they stay inside because inside means protection inside means Authority as long as you stay inside the devil will only be a bluffer in your life whether you are praying against the enemy or you are not praying against the enemy as long as you abide in the word you have an automatic protection it is not much of your prayers that God actually wanted it is much of your obedience you love him tonight now when you stay inside here before the devil can get you he has to undergo what you underwent to stay inside here do you know that for you to be inside here you will ordained in the very thought of God as a predestinated seed at an helect an ordained to this very salvation Satan must meet that requirement the reason you can be born again tonight the reason you are born again is because there was something to be quickened let me tell you church if you are born without this thing to be quickened you can never ever be born again it is not the new birth that makes you a child of God what the new birth does is to bring you to the realization that you are a child of God you were always a son and you have been ordained a son even before you were manifested because in the thought of God he had you in mind he has the picture of who you want to be who he wants you to be he ordained it right within him and because the thoughts of God are [Applause] Eternal let me tell you something about God's thought they said thought what is thought Express now if I promise this brother if I think in my heart to buy a thigh for this brother and I did not say it out you know nobody knows even himself does not know so he cannot hold me responsible if for instance I'm not able to do it I will feel free because I haven't mentioned it to him but that is the thought of a man the thought of God is [Applause] different when God thinks about anything whether he says is out or he does not say it out he holds himself responsible that is why brother Braham said the thought of God is as real as his [Applause] word and this is why if you were in the thought of God which I believe you are this is why you are manifested this is where you were born by your parents this is why you are here tonight there is nothing under Heaven that could have stopped your coming even when you were conceived and if your parents ever thought that it was a mistake and they attempted aborting you you will be un abortable because you are the thought of God you cannot abort you cannot stop the thought of God Is that real so God put you in his thinking and that is why you are manifested now when he thought about you he never thought about you as a sinner he thought of you he conceived you because he is the holy God he conceived you as a saint but when you were born here because of the condition of your birth which was a permissive birth it was a permissive process but it remains unacceptable even though God permitted it he refused to accept it that is why he says You must be born again if he accepted your first birth he will not make it a must for you to be reborn he allowed it but he will never accept it but because of the condition of that birth you came here without a fighting chance now what was breath in you was your flesh by your parents but your soul came from God now God takes the picture of you by your soul not by your flesh and that was why when you became manifested the Reckoning of God for your life is in relation to your soul no matter what your flesh is doing God refused to accept [Music] [Applause] it God refus to recognize it now if this is not true then there there is nothing called true justification God was looking at it but you see the reason he followed you around in does your Reckless living is because he has a deposit inside of [Applause] you so it was the deposit of him that connected you and when you do your funny funny things he just do like this some things might be embarrassing he closes his eyes and when you are over he still following after you why because you are his thinking now when people are looking at you ordinarily you don't look like somebody who could amount to anything spiritually but God told Samuel you look at faces I look at the AR and as long as God looks at your heart he sees his representation he sees his Gene and by that Jin he continue to follow you knowing all the time that you will come to your realization so your ordination was unto life before the devil could get in here his got to have the same ordination but he doesn't have it the reason you could repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and receive the Holy Ghost is because you were predestinated [Applause] so if the devil wants to come in here he got to also repent he got to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he got to receive the Holy Ghost if he's able to do that he will no longer be devil he will be your brother but Satan cannot repent one of the attribute of Satan is that he cannot repent and as long as he cannot repent he cannot go further as long as he cannot go further he cannot come inside so he will remain outside you will remain inside stay inside Church of the Living God now when you take a notion to come outside like these men here that we have just read the first attitude of God is not to attack you God doesn't behave like that us you say how do you know you can travel to the Garden of Eden when Adam fell out of favor by sin the first attitude of God was not even to attack or to condemn Adam sinned and ran away is that right now he is supposed to be the one looking for help but he never even waited for help to come he ran away but when God came he was the one looking for his own son meaning he is a god of reconciliation hallah brother brah said God's first attitude is to woo you and plead with you and have conference with you to bring you back inside because he knows you are not safe outside you are only a strong Church of the the Living God as you can abide inside so that is the first attitude of God son come back inside daughter come back inside don't stay outside it's not [Applause] safe it is when you reject God's provided plan for reconciliation that God takes it further you know why we have to take it further because it cannot lose you [Applause] you do you know Jesus already offered Thanksgiving over your life read your Bible he said father I thank you because all that you gave me I lose none isn't that what is said how can he offer Thanksgiving on my life and recount his Thanksgiving he will not be better than me because that means he doesn't know the end from the beginning but because he knew the end from the beginning he knew that I cannot be lost so he offered an advanced Thanksgiving on me on you that Thanksgiving cannot be withdrawn so this is why he cannot lose you whatever it takes he must get you inside the prophet went further to say you might as well also hear this he said if you wouldn't mind him instead of him to ever allow you to slide into blasphemy he's got one more option you want to hear that he's going to take you off the scene aha aha it is still his goodness because he cannot afford to lose you he's got no replacement for you in his kingdom so friends let's stay inside so this man who was supposed to be in here in his Jerusalem started descending when you reject the wi of God the next guest you will meet will not be Angels if you are becoming spiritually stubborn let me remind you you wouldn't see Angels after you reject God reconciliation plan and it doesn't change the fact that you are a child of God uhhuh the next people you will see are the people this fellow saw thieves and robbers [Music] and you know who the thief and the robber is if you don't know read John chapter 10 Jesus call him the devil so he's going to come with his agent and they are going to M you they are going to wound you they are going to Hur you so bad and leave you half dead there are so many moving cses all over Inu they alive but they are dead all over Nigeria they are there all over the world they are there brother Braham said half dead means physically alive but spiritually dead so they left this man so wounded because he was traveling in the wrong direction he shouldn't be going to Jericho Jericho has nothing good for him but you see it was this condition of half death that brought him his Blessing because the first thing that did was to stop him on that journey and while he was wounded in the middle of the road he be everybody became helpless until the Good Samaritan came the prophet said that Good Samaritan was the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] himself and he cleaned his wound and he washed him and he dressed him with the first age and started looking for an inkeeper Hallelujah we've got many inke Keepers tonight the pastors are inke [Music] Keepers he was able to get one and he took this man there and he said treat him at my expense that means this boy or this man will enjoy unlimited treatment because my father is rich in lands and houses he holdeth the wealth of the world in his hands of rubies and diamonds of silver and gold his cers are full his God riches Untold treat him at my expense I'm going to give you two pennies the spirit and the word oh may God bless the pastors God knowing god knowing what it takes to treat the wounded he gave them the spirit and the word meaning that if you don't have the spirit and the word you cannot treat this end time wound it is not programs it is not devices it is the spirit and the word when people are getting Wayward what they need is the spirit and the W nothing more nothing less we need the proper diet of the word we need the Holy Spirit God will take care of the [Music] rest the two pennies are the spirit and the word and he said if you need any other thing when I return I will had more so if you are wounded tonight there is hope for you come for the Spirit come for the word and you will be F you love him tonight but then church that is just a background this is where we are going why did Jericho became ACC caed why wasn't it like Jerusalem because ordinarily if you read about the history of Jericho is a wealthy City and it's a Gateway City where they enjoy enormous tollgates so you may hardly find a poor man as a citizen of Jericho but despite all this credential God bless you brother and L despite all these credentials this city became Aur why and from here be I begin to draw a parallel because you must know that the stories of the Bible are not stories like your novels it is the story of life and this entire bundle of story of Life the conclusion is that they are prophecies they are shadows of things that are to come brother brah said they represent your Shadow and today you represent the reality so why did Jericho became a cause there were some people who were called The Exodus people how many knows we in another Exodus we've been through exoduses in the Bible and we're in the third and the final one the first Exodus God was calling a nation out of a Nation the second Exodus he was calling a church out of religion and in this last one is calling the bride out of the church now the prophet said the reason we need to look at the first Exodus critically is because this is the last day and the last day will vindicate the first day meaning that the first Exodus was a seed Exodus whatsoever was planted there will come to full harvest in this last Exodus you will realize that brother BR brought to us the truth of serpent seed is that right and it looked like a Greek when he was saying that one woman within the space of a period became impregnated by two beings Adam and the serpent is that hot but thank God for election that makes us believe hot [Applause] things now 1958 was the year the prophets publicly and directly without drawing inferences preached Serpent and in order for God to back up the prophet God allowed a white woman to be impregnated by two men black and white that was the first time it will happen in the world history and this woman gave birth to two children of two races one was completely black and the other was completely white and uh it became a puzzle the white husband came and said I'm just going to be responsible for my son because this one is my color so it fitted perfectly white versus white he said I don't know about this one and the woman had to confess that I was with my husband over the night then I went to play with my boyfriend who was a black man at some point and in the interval of hours she became conceived by two men now it startled the world but one man was not startled the prophet came back to the church he said have you seen what has just happened it was the last day vindicating the first [Applause] day if we were not in the Garden of Eden to see what happened we are back here in our centuries and seeing the same thing repeating so it was true that Eve was conceived by two beings so this last Exodus must vindicate must have all the Articles and the characters of what the First Act and that is why it is important for us to look at it now when this first Exodus people started journeying from Egypt they came to a place they've journeyed and had many victories they crossed the Red Sea they went through the Wilderness they enjoyed all the supernatural of God they even came to Jordan and the Waters of Jordan parted for them and they left a memorial but then they came to a place they called Jericho now this city of Jericho being a Gateway City always has his Gates opened but when The Exodus people were ready to pass the Bible said the gates of Jericho was deliberately shut are you following my story deliberately and intentionally shut because of the Exodus people now the prophet said the life of God is wrapped around Israel meaning that if you shut out Israel you have automatically shot out God and I'm beginning to look at the seven Church ages when you look at the Philadelphian Church age the Bible the prophet call it the age of the open door are you following meaning all the ages since the beginning of the work of reformation in Luther the Hedge was so opened for people to come in and and come out there was more inflow coming in but it will surprise you that an age after Philadelphian age the next one laia was an age that closed his gat all right we're coming Jericho Gates that have always been opened but because of the Exodus people read your Bible is there suddenly became short and the ages of the Gentile that was open so op until God called The Prophet called the age of Philadelphia the sixth age the age of the open door you will expect the opening to continue to the seventh but by the time it eats the seventh age it became shorts and not just shorts to everybody it was short to only one person because only one person had the testimony of behold I stand at the door who was that the Lord Jesus Christ laian shut his gate against Jesus just as Jericho shut its gate against the people of Jesus so figuratively they shot it against Jesus why and the leader of the Exodus went to make some appeasement to the king of Jericho said you don't need to shut your gate on hor open it we are gentle people we are Christians we don't take on due Advantage we just want to pass through your land we need this experience to enter into our land the king of Jericho might have said isn't there other places that you can pass why must you pass through my land and the Lord replied it is Jericho that I have ordained for my people to pass through I have no alternative God does not make provision for Alternatives because it must prove to you that I'm in charge of this it must prove to you that nobody can stop me I have no other alternative plan it is human beings that come with Plan B God doesn't have plan B he's always plan A and nothing more he said this is where I want to pass say you can't pass here we have shut our gate okay let's enter a deal if any of our cattles or our children became excited and they take anything off of your land we'll pay for it we don't need your money don't just pass such an hatred brother brah said they don't want a Revival simply because these folks do not belong to their group it's in the message it said they are so carried away with their denominational grouping let me tell you church let me tell you Church the reason some people in The Exodus were not able to go beyond the Wilderness was because when they physically came out of Egypt Egypt never came out of [Applause] them so there is always a physical Egypt to deal with and there's always a spiritual Egypt to deal with [Applause] I want you to know that Pagan room is not as powerful as Papa room you didn't catch that Pagan Rome is not as deadly is not as destructive as Papa Rome Pagan Rome is political Rome Italy when he was in charge under musolini taking control of the earth as one of the eims but is not as tough as the spiritual room who is taking charge of the earth through Vatican let's leave it as [Music] that because if you read Revelations chapter 13 you will realize that this spiritual room is deadly and NOS nobody it does not even have regard for God so but it is important you are delivered of the physical Egypt and also the spiritual Egypt if you have come out of Egypt let Egypt come out of you it will be your total Deliverance you know the problem of the people in that Exodus when any challenge came across their P even though they have left Egypt for close to two years oh are there no graves in Egypt why have you brought us here to destroy us when they get hungry oh we remember the Cucumbers of Egypt we remember the gxs of [Applause] Egypt they came out of Egypt Egypt never came out of them that is halfway Deliverance you need total [Applause] Deliverance spiritual men will catch [Music] it you love him tonight so this Jericho never wanted anything about the Exodus Revival they said they won't pass through here well if you know the credentials of the walls you will appreciate the confidence of these people to stop The Exodus children we are told that this wall on the surface is as wide as a six lane road because it could run six chariots apart without touching each other so in our modern day it will be like a sizling road so why with concrete and it forms a round circle or a four corner Circle all over the entire Jericho so these people have confidence in their worlds spiritual men it's unfolding to [Applause] [Music] them you will soon realize that this is only ordinary p cing it does not have any substance they have strong confidence not only confidence arrogance Pride unusual boldness about this wall of Jericho brother brah called the wall of Jericho [Applause] denominationalism hey hey wait in the 50th year of Aza jubile listen to me very well it was supposed to be a celebration and they never got any better [Music] person [Music] e e e e e will have an another [Applause] Jubilee now Pentecostal Jubilee was a jubilee of Beth we need a jubilee of growth because after birth there must be growth in order to continue to sustain the joy of birth in 1963 presented us with another Jubilee which was a jubilee of growth 50 years when the full word of God was born into manifestation and it came with another indictment what God called us out of we have found ourself in it but the prophet left us with the promise he said in the Year of Jubilee the old Fighters must giveway in order for the children of Jubilee to receive their [Applause] freedom so Jericho wall was so thick and these people had confidence even Joshua had no idea of how they will ever enter through that wall and pass by the Bible said it was so short and the people who shot it were not even ready to have a conversation but do you know what happened in order to pull down this wall there must be an appearance because only God has the formula to pull down the wall God allowed this church to pass through Jordan and after Jordan he called for a fresh circumcision and The Exodus judge was obeying the Bible said the second circumcision became necessary because all the old Generations who rebelled against God have died out the new ones that were born in the wilderness needs to be circumcised in order for them to be prepared to receive the visitation of the almighty God after this circumcision Then There came an [Music] appearance suddenly Joshua was standing I think Pastor Ray touched it somewhere or was it brother Isaac Joshua was standing and all of a sudden the angel of the Lord came down and when it came down Joshua Drew out his sword are you for hor or you against us even God who knew that he is bound by his word quickly introduced himself there's a reason why he did that because he has promised Joshua beforehand no man will be able to stand against you and this Joshua this Joshua believed everything God told [Applause] him you think God does not believe his own word he beli his own in the message perfect faith when God came in flesh the prophet said for God himself in flesh to be able to do what his own word said he has to read it and believe what he said concerning his own self so it would have been very dangerous for him not to introduce himself fast and when he did Joshua said ah ah so it is our Lord up here then he told him put up thy [Music] shoes and as Joshua hallowed the presence of God why did God came down he came down for only one mission to give the mystery or the revelation of how to pull down the wall of Jericho read your Bible is [Applause] there and he told him this is not a job for bulldozers this is not a caterpillar job this is not Earth moving equipment job but I'm going to give you the prescription you follow it and all will be well this message of the how is our Everlasting prescription and is good for everything is good for anything follow it and all will be well God has to come down have we traveled very far we've traveled very far listen to this let's begin to draw the parallel laian H shut his gate don't forget that Revelations 3 verse 14- 21 told us that the gate was shut the one who was supposed to be inside was outside if you keep Jesus outside you have kept life outside so inside will be what Darkness if you keep Jesus outside you have kept light outside inside will be what darkness and death that is why laian condition became so bad for you to stay inside because they kept Jesus outside by keeping Jesus outside they became miserable riched poor blind and on top of it they knowe it it not spiritual [Applause] Amnesia you cannot live inside that but they don't want you to go out in the message Feast of a trumpet the prophet said for 2,000 years the denominational WS have blocked the movement of the Holy Spirit [Music] Spirit but something has got to be done you cannot prevent Jesus because he's got people within that wall to be delivered and he has to pass through it in order to bring out his own you say Jesus pass another way he said no I have no alternative I must go through here he said behold I stand at the door listen to what he says if any man open to me in other words laian will never be saved as a group there will be no Collective salvation for loud here when I say laia that is Pentecostal loud this year because we traveled from justification of Luther and came into the sanctification of Wesley and came into the new birth of Pentecostals or Pentecost but birth is not the end of life is the beginning of manifested Life this little brother here was born one day but inside him as he is here now is the potential to be a father hey wait a minute to be an adult to be a husband to be a father a grandfather even a great [Music] grandfather but all this potential in order to be revealed needs just two things the right atmosphere and balanced diet as you give him the correct food and you keep him in the right environment leave the rest one of these days he will send you his invitation card you will come to his wedding one of these days because it was already in him and it's in you brother Braham said when you receive the new birth you have adoption in potentiality right there Lord hallu what you need is correct diet pure spiritual food in Du season some of us know the destination but the challenge is how to get there if you don't know how to get there you will keep jumping you will keep excited you won't get there at the end of the day you feel frustrated you will say let us assume I am there assumption doesn't take take you there you must go through the road the road is a revelation of the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] word why will God insist on Jericho because Rahab was there hey hey hey hey hey hey I'm striking a shadow tonight RAB you will realize that RAB was a type of the Bride because it was the generation of Rahab that produced Christ in flesh and it is this R generation that is going to bring forth Christ for this hour [Applause] RAB was there so it is of necessity that God must pass through it he doesn't have business in Jericho he's not going to live there but his God is one in there God is not going to live in laia that is blind wretched miserable that's a poor condition but he's got people in there that he must bring out [Applause] and do you know how God brought out RAB he sent after God gave Joshua the formula it looks so silent amen it looks like nothing has happened we only heard of the appearance of the Angel and it said this he said that but you see it was after he left that Joshua began to pray what the angel [Music] brought what a silent hour what a silent gospel and after we have run through the Journey of justification we came into sanctification we came into the Pentecost New Birth friends we needed something more if we're going to meet the condition of this hour because Pentecostal cannot meet the condition of this hour we needed something more even these that we needed the prophets did not know what God has given him this far is to be able to explain things that are written around the media structure it couldn't explain what was inside and it will take what was inside to start rapturing faith in you and her it will take what was inside to give us a lift that we needed to fly out it will take what was inside to bring to us the realization that we are not denominational Bard chickens because up to that time from Luther to Wesley to pentecostales year the identity of the Bride wasn't clear it was all congregation ah [Music] oh everybody looks the same everybody feels the same but we needed something to separate possessors from professors I'm using the language of the Prophet brother brah said Ramses and the Moses they were raised in the same Palace and they dwelt together for too long but the hour must come that they must go their different [Music] way deceit cannot be air with the shock it was good a shock has carried it thus far but this shock must give away so that we can harvest the [Applause] seed it will take something more than Pentecostal Revival brother Brown said their Crossing of Jordan was a type of their new birth that passed them from death into life but after Jordan Jericho was [Music] waiting and this Jericho stood solid to challenge The Exodus people this is why the angel had to come down and in order for us to be able to pull down the walls of laia and get the RAB house [Applause] the has to come down again and seven angels came down that was why when the prophet used the Crowbar to knock off the head of the stone and when that precious stone became appeared so innocent the prophet said it is the truth in the Bible upon which nobody has attempted interpretation but you watch brother brah couldn't talk about it like he talked about the things around when we are tying the loose hands this time around he needed more than the grace of a lan messenger he needed a Grace more than that of a seventh angel messenger of laia because even as a seventh angel messenger brother Braham said there are so many things we have guessed at at the denominational ages of the church Hallelujah but now we needed something that will take care of all the guest work and bring the Perfection with perfect interpretation to clear every ignorance because for 2,000 years yes Jesus has been interceding for our ignorance but the days of ignorance intercession will soon be over because the full word of God is going to be born into manifestation this is why after the full word of God was born brother Braham said the scripture has been perfectly interpreted and it canot be thoroughly and perfectly understood [Applause] we needed something more than what we have heard this is the reason instead of the Prophet waiting to explain it he withdrew himself he was in the East he started going west to do what to have an Angelic encounter that will reveal Jesus again in form of the cloud God bless Pastor H for the cloud message you see the reason why the devil is fighting the [Music] cloud let me tell you without that ring of mystery you are not better than a Pentecostal believer I'm telling you the devil knew what that holds for you this is why he's fighting it it's a smoke of an aeroplane that's blasphemy the prophet said it wasn't a smoke of an herlan seven angels actually came down before Witnesses Fred stman was there Goman was there they took cover they knew something happened because God came down what did they come down to do hey hey hey the you see the devil doesn't like this now but he came stop it what did they come down to do to give brother Braham another commission the commission the revelation of what it takes to bring RAB out of [Applause] laia because you need beyond the first pole you need beyond the second pole they were good but they attracted all kinds from among these all kinds we need the T to saive out the bride out of all kinds and this was what they went w for and when he was coming back he never knew they took the picture he left straight for somewhere to appear in a court and make intercession for a boy who was on the death parrow and when he came back one of the officers in the church showed him the picture amen and uh the picture attracted him so well because he could relate his experience with it now what this Brethren don't realize attacking it was that 6 months to one year before brother Braham has prophesied it says is this the time and he explained the mechanism of how it will happen because he saw it as a vision and do see the Lord can never [Applause] fail then the prophet took the picture and kept it for a while but the first time he spoke about it he said this picture I never realized it was taken but it could have been taken two days before or two days after I was there if it was two days before it was the angels of God lowering down to give me my commission if it was two days after it was the angels of God going back after the commission that was his first public statement on the Ring of mystery then he began to explain that this took place he said when this Angels Came Down they swept me up in the Pyramid of themselves he said because the truth of the seal and the Thunders l in their midst and after they brought him back they told him you are in West go back East which is jille and for the next seven nights you are going to preach the SS so they gave him the formula and he preached that in his church Joshua preached it in in his church and after the summon wait for it the tape boys who had recorded the message brother Braham said it was the two tape boys Hallelujah spies who went into Jericho under cover and when they were going the Lord was guiding their parts to the house of the predestinated you did not believe the message by chance [Applause] you say I didn't just know it happened yes you are right but God knew why it happened of all houses that these two holy Brothers could go why the house of an allot you think they went there for paston patronage no sir they went there for Spiritual Recon ilation even this woman must have been worried herself because in her house she has an inn and then she will be in her home place expecting that at some point if her service is needed they can call on her but he find out that these two gentlemen were not calling on her so what's wrong with this kind of this is bad Market and uh maybe one day she just went there to his drop what what what are they here for and then while you was withdrawing she hear good morning friends if you are not familiar with the tape you won't understand what I've just said ah she had good morning friends we just finished some meeting in Oklahoma we are now moving to the West Coast and she waited and listened for a while and the message was becoming something else she knocked the [Applause] door excuse me come out what is the tape you are playing oh sorry we have message Believers we are just playing the tape of the message of the hour and they begin to testify and she said wait a minute don't tell me you are those people for whom your God opened the Red Sea ah we are are you the people for whom God opened Jordan yes we are are you the people for whom God destroyed the kings of the amorites seon and OG yes we have are you the people for whom God Reign Mana from on high yes yes we are are you the people for whom God created water from the rock yes we [Applause] hey look look look look look look look look look my house have seen the glory of God we have heard these things now when Rea began to make confession she never confessed only for herself she confessed for the entire Jericho because it was this a confession that sealed the Doom of Jericho wait for it you will catch it now he said we have heard are you are your god did this did that did that did that did that and because of these things we had your fear had come upon us meaning they believed those things they are but despite this believing there wasn't something in them to obey it watch out Church brother Braham said don't come this far and say I believe he said if you truly believe obey are you here if you truly behave yield yourself submit to it [Applause] he said look look look don't mind my people all we are doing is out of panic all we are doing is out of fear but I don't know how this matter will end the T boy said we know how this matter will end you see this your place whether you like it or not we are passing here we have the formula to pass here it will be revealed in the days ahead and this tape boys begin to share the message of the hour with this sister and something in her begin to ignite until she requested for the token hey R up the hot ask for the talken she want the baptism of the Holy [Applause] Ghost Church of the Living God don't forget her name was RAB the but when RAB the hot heard the message of the hour something in her hallelujah hallelujah the real heart because brother Braham said that Gene of God in you was meant to be your real you uh-huh this is the reason all that you did before the quickening of the Gin people say I have passed me I don't have passed listen to me very well me I do not have a past because what was to be real me never ever sinned and will never ever sin we must let the church know the meaning of true justification what SED was your hold you what did wrong was your old you your real you never one day [Applause] wait wait wait do you know why Esau was confused when he saw Jacob you don't know God bless you it was because he was looking for [Applause] Jacob it was Jacob he had problem with it was Jacob he believed stole his better right it was Jacob he believed tricked him but it wasn't Israel unfortunately for Esau before Jacob got to Esau he had gone into conference with God for his real him to be activated so by the time he appeared before Esau it wasn't Jacob it was Israel you cannot hold Israel responsible for what Jacob did is not possible listen to me Church of the Living God is it fair is it fair to hold Israel responsible for what Jacob [Applause] did wait wait then if it is not fear does isau have a right to tell Israel I forgive you he has a right to ask him by forgive me for what I never did it to begin with what are you forgiving me for am I am I Jacob even is will say no no no then get out of my way I need to go into my inheritance Church of the Living God you need to understand this otherwise you will never be a Christian Israel had no past it was Jacob when the Bible said listen when the Bible said Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness then he came back and robbed it in very well he said Abraham St not now you and I will say I can show you in the Bible where he left to the face of God and say let ishma live before you you can't show me any longer because what you will show me is not Abraham what you will show me is Abraham you are no more habram you are no more Jacob you are Israel you are Abraham who shall lay anything for the chge of God's elect it is God that [Applause] justify H Hall Abraham was to be your real you and let me tell you as far as God is concerned there was never a time he reckoned with Abraham that is why everything Abraham did when God invoked the Covenant he didn't see it Abraham brought forth ishmail but God came and said Abraham take thy son thine only [Music] son thine only then you will go you will go back to the Bible you go back to the Bible you say God did you forget they said by your nature you cannot forget this ishmail is old enough is too conspicuous to be forgotten that is existing it's 25 years old at the time we are talking about how can you say Isaac is the only son of Abraham God will say how can I not say that what is the son name of ishmail Abraham what is the s name of Isaac Abraham that is your true justification brother Braham said your hold record your hold book in The Book of Life not in the lamp section of the book of life that old book God took it off rap it and throw it far into the sea of his forgetfulness never ever to be remembered it does not even [Applause] exist and you will be here and allow the devil to say it's is bringing my which P it's because you have not accepted your justification [Applause] oh accept it [Applause] tonight you love him so as far as God is concerned you can keep dwelling on RAB the harot God didn't even know RAB theot existed because this same one you called R of the hot when she heard the message that quickens that gy she hungered for the new birth she hungered for the token did she receive it [Applause] yes and the moment she receiv received the talken see the Bible the value of our life Rose High amen do you know what the tape boy said Believers predestinated seed manifested believers who came to play the T they said if anything happened to you by this token the life of the two of us will go for one life of yours by the token the value of our life was raised to equal the lives of two tape boys [Applause] when you receive the token it raises your life value I'd rather be an alltime Christian than anything I know but church let me say this when this taken takes are hold like it did for Jacob like it did for Abraham it changed things completely you cannot relate their new life with what you called the whole life there was a complete change so this blessing will never make you a religious sinner uhhuh I've been Justified and you are still living wrong you never know it it is the work of God and it does [Applause] happen but I'm wetting your appetite even if you are down this evening don't stay down because there's provision for you if RAB was as filthy as she was and Mery could Rite [Applause] aive there is no life that is hopeless is here tonight no matter how low down you are there is power in the cleansing blood of Jesus [Applause] Christ look at that woman at the well she was so Lo she couldn't come out when others come but the Bible told me something Jesus was to pass away it was an appointment because even though she looks so dark outside but there was light to be quickened from within I believe there is the light of God in your heart I believe the gene of God is there otherwise you wouldn't be here you wouldn't love things like this let go and let go this evening and when she was presented with the message of that hour their requests have always been similar RAB asked for the token the woman at the well asks for the water of life it is the same thing and the moment she received it the Bible says she let down a picture and all she goes into the Town come see a man who told me all I ever did she never returns to that old life again because the change took place the prophet said God never told her everything she did but she believed that if she could if he could tell that much he could tell all blessed are those who hunger and task for righteousness they shall be filled you love him tonight but this sister was matched when they gave her the token she didn't keep quiet so okay my own case is settled how about my father the T boy said bring them in how about my mother bring them in how about my brothers bring them in my sisters in fact bring as many as you can bring in under the token that is a sound believer you know you and I have a promise I don't know how you feel about it but it's all real to me the Philippian Jailer when he saw the miracle of God he was too embarrassed he wanted to kill himself Paul and Silas or whoever say don't kill yourself we are here we are Christians we don't take on due advantage we are here he when he saw that with that one sermon he saw a life that played out like that he preached so much to these men until he said s what can I do to be saved they said for you to be saved let us show to you that it is not only you that God is interested in he said believe on the Lord and thou and I can show you from Genesis coming to Revelation to show to you that God's Plan of Salvation has always been for you and your family and he has never changed that [Applause] idea the Bible said one of the only reasons why God love to expose himself revealed things to Abraham is because he knew that Abraham will do what teach mothers are you here you've given the teaching to Sunday school teacher no sir you've given the teaching to the school teachers no sir it is your job to bring up those children if if the gospel of Matthew Mark Luke and John is going to be successful in their life they need to take the Fifth Gospel first you know God's mathematics is very tricky it doesn't run 1 2 3 4 5 mother is the Fifth Gospel but it is the First Gospel a child needs in order to make the four gospels meaningful and brother Brown said you can do more on your knees for those children that preachers can do behind the pit but you know what you cannot give what you don't have it must be in you to give it to the [Applause] children but let me say tonight that God will judge your influence upon those children the reason the daughters in America became strict tees was because their mothers were street workers the prophet said so so it's a generational Heritage what are you passing on to those children think about that this evening because it is God's program to save you and your family when we come to the middle of the Bible Isaiah told us that the Heavenly Jerusalem the new Earth and the new heaven Isaiah 65 that God is preparing for you and I he said so that you and your Offspring will be there [Music] God did not design Heaven only for you he designed it also for your children but as in every age and every Exodus Satan will look for a deal why was Pharaoh interested in the little children when he came under the heavy pounding of the plague he said you had us we even give you everything you need for service you go and serve the Lord the children did he not say so he said so because he knew that the continuity of that Revival depends on the continuity of so he wants to kill the Revival by destroying the little children but you got four things to do Church mothers and fathers are you here you've got four things to do the prophet said you must believe that if it works for you it's going to work for them to do that you don't look at symptoms their condition may not make them look like proper children but don't ever call your child a serpent [Applause] seed if the lord gave those children to you he never gave them to be an Affliction in your life the Devil May interfere but you've got to buckle up on your knees and win them back for the Lord Jesus Christ he said the first thing is believe that if it works for you it will work for them then number two live a life worthy before them number three spend time to share the word and to pray with them number four read your house of every wrong atmosphere create the right environment things that shouldn't be in your house throw them out all those dirty games and nonsense throw it out the door if anybody ask you what are you doing we are doing house cleaning environmental sanitation we want a place clean all the dirty dresses all the dirty magazines throw them out [Applause] when you do that brother Braham said leave the rest to God you hold on for them leave the rest to God they will come in Rab was too smart a Believer she brought a family under the token and when the T boy finished that business that's all they came for in Jericho they left and the next thing the the church kept advancing this laia is going to be judged after the Lord takes out every re this is why this is the time of coming out and going in we're going into something else I don't live in laia any longer that's why the Deeds of laia don't bother me because my master stood outside my husband stood outside he said be old I stand at the door and I'm knocking now watch what he said in this knocking he wasn't interested in Saving in getting everybody it is in the whosoever that whosoever has got to be predestinated how did laia get into that condition it was this same La this year follow with me now as we close this same laia in 1962 was crying for Revival if you are familiar with the message this will be nice for you they were crying for Revival brother Braham said there is no time they will print a a magazine that it will not be oh we need Revival it is not too late yet there will be a Breaking of the day we love the Lord Herod of Hope Revival then the prophet came to the church in early 63 he said this cry for revival can only be satisfied with the unveiling of the seven tunders he said so come in quiet home isn't it then shortly after he started opening the seals one seal one night one seal one night then on the seventh night or the eighth night because it jumped or the ninth night then it became the seventh seal which never became just one straight jacket thing the first seal was the first o Rider second seal red horse rider T seal uh black horse rider the fourth seal pale o rather fifth seal Souls under the altar Sixth Seal judgment seal seventh seal silence and the prophet said what is in this with nobody knows but we need to know then they began to tell the church they've unfolded into three but I will speak of one of them and that fold that I'm going to speak on is the seven [Applause] Thunders then he began to say it's are these seven tunders are the Revelation contained in the seven [Applause] [Music] seal and said you and I need it I told you we know the destination but we need to know how to get there the destination is full stature it's an adoptable child but how will this child become adopted he needs to Fellowship he needs to eat the open book The revelation of the tenders he need to eat it when he eat it he will work upon the atoms of his body and change him from Glory to Glory till he come to full sture he needs to hit it you need to hit it because that is what the open book is all about Hallelujah and brother Braham said and we yet a humble little group Hallelujah he went back to that cloud again Hallelujah and he began to talk about it he said these Heaven Angels came down and unfolded the entire mystery of the Bible to us and we yet a humble little group we are here enjoying the entire opening of the word we know the truth about marriage today we know the truth about divers about serpent seed about godhe about many other things he said this were the revelations that the word brought To Us by the opening of the seals [Applause] you will say we know some of them before the opening of the seals your faith your Revelation wasn't perfected until the opening of the seals it perfected what you knew and it opened what you never know it is these entire things you need to eat like this little baby in order to come to full statue so this is the destination this will take you to the destination that why brother Braham said the messenger of this age will do two things do you believe that he said one according to Malachi 4: 5 and 6 it will turn the heart of the children back to the fathers do we believe that will it take us to a laboratory to do that will it take us to the sergeon table to do that wait for it then it said according to Revelation 10:7 he will reveal the Mysteries of the seven Thunders did he say so so seven Thunders are some contents to bring us to full stature when we know them and eat them we are automatically growing the adding the prophet talk about is not the adding of subtraction of of mathematics you must understand that come my little brother brother Isaac declar the state of emergency yesterday so I will go beyond protocols to liberate the people of God bring him up under state of emergency you don't work by any Constitution so forgive me brother if I'm getting out of protocol the Church of God I'm running late sorry I will close now the Church of God must know this how do we hurt to the hand of this boy explain it to me but would this hand be headed to would this leg be headed to is he going to remain like this permanently he's going to grow like yours how did we Hur all the things to be added was inside the day he was born what you give him to do the addition was the food as you feed him you keep him in the right atmosphere the addition takes place you see him one day you say you are now a teenager you see him another day you are past a teenager you see him another day you are now an adult you see him another day you you are now a full grown man even if he's not doing anything about marriage you are asking him what are you doing because he has added enough to get marriage watch upon [Music] watch brings a man to full sture this is the way it is friends and that is what you and I needed re up requested for that and she got it and we requested for that and by the grace of God we are getting it you know why the Reason God abandoned loud this year was because just as Jericho testified laia please give me just 10 minutes is that okay is that okay just as just as Jericho testified we have Ed laia also testify see their testimony one day they invited brother Brown when you go home read the message in indictment they invited the prophets under cover that we want to Fellowship but the Lord knew they wanted to challenge him so the moment they mentioned the prophet the god of the Prophet attended the meeting and he listened to all their conversation before they brought their invitation the god of the Prophet went home to meet the prophet and said they they are come setting you up for a showdown he said but go there I will be with you so when they brought the invitation they said brother Braham oh God bless you the Brethren love you they want to have a fellowship with you please brother Braham said brother uh let's suppose let's think believe that I will not be able to make it can you represent me there uh he said uh it is you the one it is you the one the prophet said okay if it is me the mon I will come he said but you know what you are not actually inviting me for Fellowship you are inviting me for Showdown brother Bram how did you know I will be there for you to know I know the place you have rented to have the meeting they will not give you brother brah we have paid for it said it doesn't [Applause] matter then number two when you gather brother so and so we sit like this this will be the color of his shirt of his tie of his suit brother so and so brother so and so when that day came brother so and so the first thing was that sorry we can't give you this place we just check from our record somebody else had paid much earlier we are offering you another place the same place brother brah said they will do the meting it came to pass then on that day brother so and so sat like this brothers who are so sad like that the brother who brought invitation said before you call Brother Braham excuse me you may have your opinion about this man but I want you to know he knows what he's talking about and he's not afraid of any of you ah he told me we shall not have this that place we shall have here we are here he told me you sit like this you are there you will sit like this you are there I think that should have made them repented but they refus but it was God's way of allowing them to hear it then the prophet stated all the things that we believed and after he said if anybody have a contrary view with your Bible come here nobody came out till today they haven't come forget about this their little gener ation Rascals talking nonsense their fathers never [Applause] came they had enough opportunity they never came so we shall listen to this ones after the service instead of coming out they kept quiet after the service brother Braham oh we are so sorry we don't know that's how the thing is as a matter of fact we are coming to be baptized again I'm going to buy 70 of those tapes and send to all my parishes brother baram waited in 1965 they never came maybe if they come today we will be the one that we baptize them but they never came and the prophet in the message indictment came back he said do you watch those folks who said they were coming since 1958 of 59 they said they were coming we haven't seen them he said but do you know what they have done and do you know in that meeting it was over 300 that was like man camel Showdown again do you know that was representative of all the Pentecostal L this year see what happened it said they never came he said but do you know what they have done they confess that that thing was the truth they believed it was the truth but but refused to walk in it they committed unpardonable sin read the message indictment laia commit what is unpardonable sin in the message of pardonable sin brother brah said it is hearing the truth accepting that it is the truth and refusing to work in it there is the unpardonable sin so the church what committed unpardonable sin and the prophesy from that moment God will never save a church but he will bring individuals out of the church so there will never be a national Revival or a national salvation it will be one year one day coming out of all denominational grouping then in 1964 he pronounced them irredeemable in the message recognizing your day and its message he said loudest went past redemption in 1965 in the message ashamed of him he pronounced them dead that is why what you have been seeing today is a dead form of laaia I pity those of you who are still excited by Pentecost You Are exacted by a dead form it shows you are never born again because when life move it moves with everything if you want the true justification it in the message true sanctification is here true baptism is here then if you get through of those things you are going to be adopted it's as certain as anything finally RAB got out of love this year or Jero as you may call it and became what by the token became inducted into the economy of Israel and by that became marriage ah under no circumstance must you as a Believer marry an unbeliever it does not have a type in the Bible for you as a church member to follow before RAB could be marriageable in Israel she was inducted by the token she came into the economy of Israel by Redemption Ruth also came in by Redemption everyone that will be marriageable must come in by Redemption don't go out and pick them because you cannot redeem [Applause] them if you don't like that I'm sorry but I have a responsibility I've got to tell you the truth under no circumstance [Applause] and reab got married to a general in Israel and they gave birth to a child called the boas and boas got married to another redeemed Gentile and they gave bir to A Child Called HED and HED gave back to Jesse and Jess gave back to David and from David came the Lord Jesus Christ so the linage of these folks produce Christ when we marry right and receive receive the true justification will produce nothing but Christ outside of Jericho God bless [Applause] [Music]
