every single one of his children what an honor and a privilege it is to be able to recognize that you know the prophet has said that it's the greatest privilege that man could ever have to be able to speak with his lips to the ears of the Lord Jesus Christ to God Almighty to be able to offer our praise in spirit and in truth what an honor and a privilege it really is we certainly never want to

ears to hear what the spirit saith let me get out of the way father and just allow you to have the preeminence that you desire tonight father Lord we just love you and we thank you and we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians if you have your Bibles tonight I would just like to read out of First Corinthians chapter 1. First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 26. we'll read down to verse 31. foreign Corinthians chapter 1 verse 26. for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and the things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord let's just bow one more time gracious Lord Jesus we pray that tonight father that we could just glory in you and Lord that it wouldn't just be for tonight that it would be for all time Lord if there's any anything good Lord Jesus in our lives let it be you that we talk about father Lord to think about how you've brought us through this world father to the place that we are positionally in tonight there's no way that we could ever have done it not one of us on our own if it were not your will so father tonight we just thank you and we pray that we could just bring Glory unto you that we would glory in you we just love you we thank you we ask that you would bless the reading of your word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly good to be back after our trip and to be catching up we've had uh a lot going on recently and we're certainly thankful the Lord has given us the ability to do what we've done what we're doing and go through the stuff that we are going through um but yes it's certainly good to be back and and getting sort of on top of things um if nothing changes in the next 24 hours or less it looks like we will be able to have 27 people here in church on Sunday we're certainly looking forward to that really looking forward to that I trust that the Lord will continue to allow things to change for us so that we can do that and Lord willing the end of the month or you know sometime next month we could be at full capacity here which is just enormous we were talking about it earlier and I wasn't sure what the capacity is for outdoor Gatherings but it was mentioned that it could be 150 people with this uh new restriction tomorrow so I would say this if if that's the case then I would say plan on some kind of spur of the moment picnics we're going to have some fellowship brothers and sisters for those people who want to those people who can not everyone can just drop everything and and come but you know uh we had a little taste of it in the parking lot here on Sunday and it sure was nice to see some familiar faces just to be outside and and and to be together to Fellowship so it looks like the restrictions are lifting and what a tremendous thing it is it's going to be glorious um we have a spring cleanup lined up for the church um I believe it's June 12th is that right June the 12th we'd like to do it from 10 in the morning until three in the afternoon we know that many hands makes light work so if you feel inclined if you feel inspired to bring a pair of hands to the church and come and we'll do a little cleanup and it in years past not last year but years past it's always been a nice time of Fellowship afterwards as well you know everybody brings uh brings a little bit of Fellowship to the table and a little bit of food yeah um we certainly excited about it so we're looking to full capacity in July and I don't understand what that will even be like but we'll trust the Lord will actually bless us um tonight I have a direction that uh I just feel impressed to go in and uh we'll just see if the Lord won't bless it it's kind of like almost two things at once but you know um just reading in the in the seals book getting into a little bit of the seals how brother Branham talks about what the word is and how the word represents itself to us as Believers and not just to us but through us brother Bradham says in the fourth seal that the word itself is a spirit it is a spirit in word form and then you see it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts you know we talked about it on Sunday that it's a revelation to the True Believer we wind up getting things revealed to us and uh many times people they have a a theology and we talked about that theology if you look it up actually in Merriam-Webster a current dictionary it's one's belief in God and and that's all it's pretty simple and straightforward it's not even the instruction or teaching from a school it's just one's belief in God but if you look at old Noah Webster's Dictionary he talks about it in there and says that there's two two directions of the word Theology and one is natural carnal and the other one is revelation and we know that the word itself that we talk about tonight is truly a revelation because anybody can say the word word anybody can talk about the Bible anybody can say Jesus we know that millions and billions of people both have Jesus and the word and they're baptized in titles and what that does is it stops the power of God from being completely Unleashed in their lives but also we know that Spirits travel on words that's how Spirits travel so that's why it's so important to make sure that we are careful what we listen to we need to be careful what we watch and you know it's just becoming more and more clear to me in in my life it's important who we listen to as well as what we listen to we can take many different people's words and if we're not careful there can be words coming into our lives carrying spirits that like to try and get in the way of what we're doing try and get in the way of God's program we know that if we're sealed into the kingdom of God if we have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we've met the requirements that we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives Satan's going to come against us with all of his might he's going to try and try and try he's never going to give up he's created to be that way but what we're talking about tonight is the word itself is Spirit and and it itself is in word form but when those words are spoken off of the lips and the voice of a True Believer it's no longer just a True Believer speaking and there's a quote for it I'm not going to get into that tonight I just wanted to try and set a little bit of a background about the importance of the word and how God he never chose the great programs in this world we just read it tonight that God hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise he goes exactly against what it is we think should happen carnally speaking our theology is is a waste of time but when we talk about revelation now we're getting somewhere especially according to the message of the hour because we understand that that word itself is actually spirit and when that word is on the lips of a True Believer who has been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins so that they could receive the gift of the Holy Spirit the true baptism of the Holy Spirit it burns out all of the dross in their life and when that word comes forward on the lips of a son and daughter of God it's no longer the son or daughter speaking is it it becomes full adoption and you know brothers and sisters even though we can't see it when we come to that place in our lives where we have everything in line and we know that the word itself is a spirit and that word is in spirit form and that word is on our lips and we're speaking it all hell trembles when you speak the word that way all hell is afraid of it you know the Devils they recognize Jesus but the most religious people couldn't same thing today brothers and sisters most religious people will look at us and say frenetics weirdos cults they'll have all kinds of different names for us but watch when you get around someone who has a vicious disease or someone that has a devil you ever seen someone that's all all crazy in the head as it were on the side of the road and walk up beside them you don't even have to say anything we've all I'm sure had experiences that way the Devils can't stand it when a True Believer gets close to them because they know they know who's standing by them you know I just have a couple of quotes as we get into our thought tonight um how brother Branham he says that the word is a spirit the spirit is in word form and that's what the Bible is and and talking about how God he likes to hide himself in Simplicity and reveal himself in the same he hasn't chosen the great things of this world to reveal himself in he didn't come to the the four seasons of Bethlehem did he even though there was no room but he didn't come in a great godly way he came to a stinking stable where there was animals how many of us would ever want to go to a stable to have our first child it just wouldn't happen we would go and and and go in someone's house before we would do that but he chose it was no accident there was no room at the end it was no accident that everything happened the way it did that they wrapped him in swaddling cloths the nastiest stinkiest probably hardest cloth that there was around they wrapped Jesus in as a fresh newborn baby there's no accident that they use that that that that cloth that went between the Yoke of the ox that absorbed all the bugs and the sweat and and all the grime this freshly born baby the Lamb of God was wrapped in that cloth it's no accident everything happens for a reason brothers and sisters but just talking out of the fifth seal here just going to read a couple things brother Branham says now now let me just let me just review that for a minute what makes God great is because he can make himself so simple that's what makes him great God is so great he can make himself in such a simple form that the wise of this world can't find him they just can't find him because he makes himself too simple now watch and this in itself is the mystery of the revelation of Jesus Christ see this in itself there's nothing greater than God and you can't make anything as simple As He makes himself see that's what makes him great see he goes on he goes on to say but the Way Up Is Down In God yes I like how brother Bradham tells this story here he tells just a little bit of a story here I've I've went into people in their offices and so forth that were really were were men big Kings see and potentates and monarchs and usually them are big men then I've went into places where a guy got a change of clothes maybe some Minister that wanted to argue with me a while and you would think that the world world couldn't run without him see that's a pretty important man and you would think that the world couldn't run without him see and that's just puffed up in the head see but a big man a big man sits down and tries to make you think you're the big man see he can humble himself imagine that I was having a conversation on the way to church with someone about how some people are like that and you know it doesn't matter whatever the conversation is that's happening in the moment they have to grab the conversation and take the conversation and make the conversation all about them did you ever talk to someone that's like that it just doesn't matter every time you get around that person they just have to grab it and make it them it's all about them it's funny how it works but you know what brother Bradham says the prophet says but a big man see he can humble himself he sits down and tries to make you think that you're the big man it goes on to say and you see God is so great till he can humble himself a place that a human being can't climb down that far you see that's all as long as you're going towards wisdom you're going away from him it's amazing when you look at what what he says and and how he says it and you know I'm not going to go on and and read all of it because there's so much here but just thinking about how how he hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same and and each one of us are are subject to that very thing I mean there's some great people in in and amongst our group and uh I certainly know that and I'm thankful to be a part of it it's wonderful to be a part of the body of God of Christ here on Earth but you know he's chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty when we think about our lives how do we ever get to where we're at and I don't know about you but I've got people in my life and my family they would probably look at me and think how did he ever wind up where he is today and you know all I can say is is Grace Grace God's grace that's all it is it's it's that Grace that keeps me from day to day there's no way that I could ever be where I'm at were it not for God and and when we actually get to that place where we have that true Revelation our own theology in a revelation way it it it it it turns into something almost like a connect connect the dot picture in our lives we can go back and start to connect the dots and we begin to see a picture and and it's amazing because we know there's no way that we could have gone through the situations that we have to get to where we are and still love the Lord you know we talked about it a long time ago the difference between a Believer and an unbeliever is is when God puts us through a trial when he we ask him to answer a prayer and he doesn't answer it the way that we want it answered the True Believer says you know thank you Lord because I know that that answer is for my good even though it's not what I want I know it's for my good and I thank you Lord and and we go on and we worship in spirit and Truth we don't get upset we don't get frustrated and say he doesn't love me we know that whether we have flowery skies and bed of ease is no approval of the Father's Love right we know that how do we know he loves us because he said so how do we know we have eternal life because he said so how do we know that we are who we believe we are he said it and I just keep going back to that thing when I had that conversation with the devil I just believe I did I don't know how many others out there do but you know when he says who said I am said I am that's all and and there's nobody else I am the beginning the end the alpha the Omega the first and the last in one one word m present tense I am what a what an amazing thing that is it's tremendous the word itself is Spirit brothers and sisters it's spirit in word form and then you see when it's quickened or brought to life when we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have that Revelation in our lives the spirit of the word goes to work and acts it does every single time not just sometimes but every time and as Believers it can be really difficult to not get caught up in a situation and actually utter words that we shouldn't utter say things that we shouldn't say I think we talked about it on Sunday if you want to see a situation change just talk positive start to speak positive the world is totally tapped into this but sometimes as as brothers and sisters it can be tough to actually not get caught up in in Satan's game I don't think we do necessarily I know I have and you have to go and make it right again you have to go and say you know brother I don't don't really think it's right but I said this and you know will you forgive me but you know brothers and sisters tonight we know that he's chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and the base things of the world and the things which are despised hath God chosen yay and the things which are not to bring to naught those things that are and and and the things which are not n-o-t is uh things that just aren't being able to say that you know I just don't have this or or this hasn't happened it hasn't materialized in my life yet it's like a brother or a sister who is looking for a mate a husband or a wife to say that I have not found that person yet but you know what there is a person for each and every one of us and and there's a whole I mean I'm not going to get into that tonight but what I'm saying is the word not in this scripture is not it's something that isn't quite yet but we're going to speak those things by faith and that's what they're talking about here what Paul is talking about the things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things which are not you know how Abraham called the things that weren't as though they were and the things that were as though they weren't it just totally lines up with this scripture here because the next part of it is to bring to not n o u g h t the things that are to actually see those things diminish to see them actually disappear it's interesting that no flesh should glory in his presence not one of us has anything to bring to the Lord not none of us has any glory to bring but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption who who the entire plan of God through Jesus Christ has made all of us Worthy that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord that's the only thing we have to glory in brothers and sisters he goes on to say in Chapter 2 and my speech and preaching was not with the enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and in power remember the word itself is Spirit where's that power when that word that spirit is on the lips of his children right Paul didn't come to them with the enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and Empower that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God how be it we speak of wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory that wisdom he's ordained unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory just want to read these two verses here the next two because I don't know I just feel it's where the Lord took me tonight but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the Deep things of God tonight I I just wanted to read a quote I can't even explain it to you um other than it's the leadership of the Lord brother miles do we have feedback on the speaker sounds like the monitor's got some static I don't know that might even be coming through the home sound um anyways out of beyond the curtain of time Billy Branham says I am more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy I feel like we could just stop and take a study just on those last two words Supreme maybe three Supreme Beauty what is that and supreme Joy a place where there's none of that stuff no a perfect place no jealousy no tiredness who's tired here tonight I could raise my hand no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy he goes on to say whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody and you know I just have to say this there's some people that believe that love love corrects and by actually going out and and straightening someone out on whatever it is that you feel led to do that for you're actually loving them and in some cases maybe but you know what save that for your children I would say for your brothers and your sisters just love them just just show perfect love that's what the prophet's talking about here and if we have any questions about what perfect love is just look at Jesus in the Bible the only ones that he got mad at were the most religious people right the most Pious ones the ones that were the most polished the ones that knew the word the best the people actually that he loved and treated really good were the ones actually that nobody else wanted to deal with he says whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even your enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love if you're not saved except Jesus Christ as your savior now if you've not been baptized in water be baptized now if you have not received the baptism of the spirit the Holy Spirit receive it now press on in that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time Hallelujah glory to God Amen so that's such a wonderful thing to think about how how he talks about that perfect love and really brothers and sisters that is the only thing that's going to make it there if we think about our lives and think about all of the theology that we've got and our understanding according to the traditional teachings of of man even about the message of the hour have we got perfect love because if we don't have perfect love then we're lacking something because he says that's the only thing that will make it there I can tell you that I honestly just felt so impressed to go this way tonight and and I got some news that somebody passed away after the leadership for this I thought why on Earth Lord are you taking me this way you know sometimes brothers and sisters we get we get blue we get sad we get down in our Spirits we still are human beings and we live in this Human Condition and and sometimes we just can't control those things they happen especially if we've lost someone that we love and I don't think there's anybody here that really hasn't lost someone that they love in their lives everyone has been affected by this but you know what get perfect love because if we get perfect love we get to go there it's tremendous so tonight I'm just going to take a bit of time I hope it's okay I'll try and do it in 40 minutes 45 minutes I want to read the story out of beyond the curtain of time and how brother Branham describes this he says how many never did hear the vision of the lord gave me let's see your hands up that never brother Neville have you got your little book there perhaps maybe you would just read it for them right here just for the next moment or two I believe it right here if you will remember Brothers and Sisters Perfect love is the only thing that's going to make it there and that's what he's talking about here and and what's perfect love gonna demonstrate by it's going to be the the word on our lips and and knowing that the word that comes out of our mouth is spirit it's not just words when we speak it's powerful it's sharper and quicker and sharper more powerful than a two-edged sword right Discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart but the Branham says right I believe it right here if you will brother Neville reading the following article of brother branham's printed in the Full Gospel businessman's voice this is out of beyond the curtain of time it's a message the other morning I was lying on my bed I just awoke from sleep and I placed my hands behind my head and relaxed with my head on the pillow then I began to wonder what it will be like on the other side I realized that I have lived more than half my life if I live to be as old as my people and I wanted to do more for the Lord before I left this life I think there's probably quite a few people that can say Amen to that when you look at your life and you think about it if you're promised three score and ten I can say that I almost fit that description myself it's amazing to think you know how many more years we don't know he says I Heard a Voice saying you're just starting press the battle keep pressing As I Lay these pondering they there pondering these words I thought that I just imagined that I Heard a Voice and again the voice said press the battle keep going keep going brother Neville continues to read still unbelieving I thought that possibly I had spoken the words myself I placed my my my lips between my teeth and held my hand over my mouth I tried doing that thinking about it huh there's no way that you're going to say a word that's what he says he did I placed my lips between my teeth and held my hand over my mouth and listened The Voice spoke again just keep pressing if you only knew what is that the end of the road why I seem to hear the music and words of an old familiar song I sent this out a little while ago I would send it out again I listened to it over and over again myself it just does something for me and and my goodness I seem to hear the music and the words of an old familiar song I'm homesick in blue and I want to see Jesus I would like to hear those arderabelle's chime it would brighten my path and banish all fears Lord let me look past the curtain of time then the voice asked would you like to see beyond the curtain would you like to see beyond the curtain I answered it would help me so much but the Neville continues to read what happened I cannot say whether I was in the body or whether it it was a translation I do not know and I know myself I I I I I I I heard this story myself initially the first time and I thought you know maybe I don't know but then when you start to see things connect like the dots we talked about a little earlier you can look at situations like this and say you know Maybe for those people who haven't heard this story you know I would say let's just turn over quickly to Second Corinthians it should be pretty close second Corinthians chapter 12. just to just to bring this out here sometimes I think it's many times I think it's super important to make sure that the you know there's a scriptural identity for these things so remember he says what what happened I cannot say whether I was in the body or or whether I it was a translation I do not know and Paul in in chapter 12 here we knew that uh we'll just start with verse one it is not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord he's going to get into this in a little while in verse 2 I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such and one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is it is not lawful for a man to utter of such and one will I Glory yet of myself I will glory not Glory but in mine infirmities and we know he goes on to talk about that and I don't want to talk about his infirmities today I just want to point out the fact that Paul the messenger for that age for the first church age he had a similar experience so this isn't really foreign if we look at it what happened I cannot say brother batam says whether I was in the body or whether I was it was or whether I it was a translation I do not know it goes on to say but it was unlike any Vision I have ever had how many Visions did the prophet have that that statement alone is astounding to think that he's probably had thousands of visions you know he's told many of them but how many more did he have that he didn't speak right but this one he says this one it was unlike any Vision I ever had I could see the place to which I was taken and I could see myself lying back there upon my bed I said this is a strange thing could you imagine that there were great numbers of people and they came running to me crying oh our precious brother first came young women apparently in their early 20s and as they would embrace me they said our precious brother young men in the Brilliance of Young Manhood with eyes glistening like stars on a darkened night with teeth as white as pearls embracing me saying our precious brother then I noticed that I too had become young again imagine that brothers and sisters this is not just an accidental documentation of a vision that someone had this is for a purpose this is to encourage us I believe that's the reason why the Lord took me this way tonight if there was one thing that I could say I just hope that the Lord would encourage Us by this story tonight that we would all just leave this meeting remembering perfect love is the only thing that's going to make it there and set aside all the stuff in our lives all the stuff that maybe seems like we need to be right or or someone needs to be wrong or we need to do or whatever none of it matters the only thing that matters is perfect love because that's the only thing that's going to make it there he goes on to say young men in the Brilliance of their manhood with eyes glistening like stars on a darkened night with teeth as white as pearls embracing me saying our precious brother that I noticed that I too had had become young again I looked at myself there and turned and look looked back at my old body lying there on the bed with my hands behind my head I said I don't understand this as I began to try to comprehend the place where I was I began to realize that there was no yesterday and no tomorrow there no one seemed to get tired can you imagine that no yesterday and no tomorrow you can't even really get our heads wrapped around that no yesterday no tomorrow nobody getting tired there as a multitude of the most beautiful young women I have ever seen through their arms around me I discovered there was only a great love that overwhelmed me I believe that's that perfect love he was talking about right there there was only a great love that overwhelmed me and no physical attraction as in human behavior I noticed these young women all wore their hair down to their waistlines and their skirts went down to their feet for the Neville continues to read after this hope my first wife hugged me and said my precious brother then another young woman hugged me and hope turned and hugged the young woman I said I don't understand this this is something entirely different from our human love perfect love no jealousy no anger no hatred no sadness no sorrow no death something entirely different from our human love he said I don't want to go back to that old body on the bed then a voice spoke to me this is what you preached that the Holy Ghost is and I love how it's worded because it's not how the Holy Ghost was right remember how we said I am the present tense how the Holy Ghost is right now hey even right now tonight then a voice spoke to me this is what you preached that the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing cannot enter here without it we know brothers and sisters it's the wedding garment it's the token it's the Holy Ghost in our lives outside of getting the Holy Ghost we won't enter that we won't be there that's why we can't stop preaching it it's it really is the Zeal for the age is to repent and not just repent but have an outward expression of the inward work that repentance it causes us to want to do everything that the word says that we should do if the word says that we should get re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for their mission of our sins even if we've been baptized in titles there's something inside us that says Amen to the word just like Mary said amen to the word just like the woman at the well said amen to the word there's something inside of us that just says Amen to the word and we just want to follow it and when we do follow it brothers and sisters then we get that perfect love in our lives and and that's what makes it so alarming for the first little while when we start coming to church and we start to have that regeneration excuse me that regeneration in our lives Things become different we're a new creature in Christ Jesus and we look around at everyone else and we think that everyone else is having the same Revival experience and many times the people around us have kind of forgotten that experience in their own lives so we go from the moment of of of coming out of sin in the world to being around Angels everyone's Angels everyone is the same place that I'm at right now tonight when I'm revived like that I got perfect love for the first time in my life but then we start to see The Human Side and Satan comes around and says did you see what they did you see what they said that guy's a Christian that guy's a believer you know what brothers and sisters that's just the devil's trick everyone is in that place everyone is having that Revival in their own lives but Satan comes around and just tries to get between us and mix it up and try and make us think different things and and have different thoughts that's why the word gives us a formula an exact formula how to deal with things but Satan comes around and tries to get us to believe that now we're not amongst a bunch of Christians we're amongst a few devils and that's not the case at all we're just dealing with the human nature all of us have personalities and we're all just trying to make it right trying to to press on towards the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus but we're contending with this flesh this hybrid condition and sometimes we'll say things sometimes we'll do things but you know what happens when we truly get perfect love that's when something will rise up inside us and say you know I I don't think you meant it that way I don't think he meant it that way we'll go home Angry and we'll wake up in the morning and we'll say oh Lord thank you for saving me thank you for what you've done in my life and you know that thing that was bugging me last night I know that wasn't them that was just Satan trying to get between us and I'm so thankful for the Revelation that you've given me because I can discern that I've been given the ability to discern the spirits according to your word I don't just get slapped around by Satan I'm above that and beyond that I'm a mature son and daughter of God I've been adopted I've got perfect love in my life that's what happens when we get perfect love we don't just get slapped around by Satan we don't have a a grunt on we don't just drag a ball and chain in and out of church we heard it said many times that people come in with their their luggage and they leave with their luggage the word says to bring your luggage and leave it at the altar just just let the the word wash you and take away the burden we don't have to leave the same way that we came in perfect love brothers and sisters I'm going to stick on that for a little while I don't know why I just believe it it's really the Holy Ghost it's the token the spirit of Truth then a voice spoke to me this is what you preached that the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing cannot enter here without it brother Neville continues to read next I was taken up and seated on a high place this is awesome next I was taken up and seated on a high place all around me were great numbers of men and women in the bloom of Youth they were crying with joy oh our precious brother we are so happy to see you here I thought I'm not dreaming for I can see these people and I can see my body laying back there on the bed can you imagine that being able to see those people and then see your body there on the bed at the same time it's amazing The Voice spoke to me you know it's written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people I said yes I remember that in the scriptures but there are not this many branhams The Voice replied these are not branham's these are your these are your converts the ones you have led to the Lord you know how brother Branham tells the story I think it's of Wesley Charles Wesley I could be wrong how one woman had the desire for a meeting to bring the word to people and only one person came to the meeting and that one person was a man I think it was Wesley he came and and got saved in the meeting the only one that came to the meeting that this woman was trying to get happening and you know what happened I think brother Branham said a million people came to Christ through this one man one person and to think about the prophet for this age how many people how many really millions of people know the message of the hour how many people have perfect love I believe there could be a lot of people there brothers and sisters lots of people we know there will be based on what he says right here some of these women you think are so young and beautiful were more than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord but now there they are in their theophany bodies that's what he's seeing is the theophany bodies of everyone the perfect picture made without spot or wrinkle hey the way that God created us from before the foundation of the world he says no wonder they are crying out my precious brother then the multitude cried together if you hadn't gone forth with the gospel we wouldn't be here what that must do to someone in a position like that to think that they serve the purpose if it wasn't for him being honest with the word and you know I can't help but think about it when when I I read this and think about his prayer at the end of the seventh seal message and if I have to go down to the river and the waves start coming in I have to lay this old sword down let someone pick it up who will be honest with it right and and to be able to do that means that will actually be preaching what Paul preached we'll be preaching what brother Branham preached to deviate from it though brothers and sisters is going to be uh we're missing out I asked oh where is Jesus I want to see him the people replied he's just a little higher someday he will come to you you were sent as a leader and when God comes he will judge you according to your teaching I love how he brings it back to the word he says I asked does Paul and Peter have to stand this judgment also the answer was yes nobody is going to be exempt from the word but you know he said it there's only one thing that he's going to judge the World by and that's by Jesus Christ which is the word and the word itself is Spirit it's spirit in word form I asked us Paul and Peter have to stand this judgment also the answer was yes he continues to read I said I preached what they preached I did not divert from it to one side or the other where they was baptized in the name of Jesus I did it too where they taught the baptism of the Holy Spirit I did it too whatever they taught I taught also I say Lord let us teach exactly the same thing let us never deviate from that teaching let us get to the place where we have perfect love in our lives where we don't get upset when the the Lightnings flashing and the plane is rocking and the enemy's guns are are banging away at us trying to get us off don't worry about it if we got perfect love we know who's in control and and nothing can kill us brothers and sisters imagine that you can't even die death cannot even touch you if you have the Holy Ghost in your life if you're a son and daughter of God you can no more die than he can die and if he can die he's not God were they taught the baptism of the Holy Spirit I did too and you know myself that's all I can say is uh maybe not all I can say but when they were baptized in the name of Jesus I did too where they taught the whole the baptism of the Holy Spirit I did too and whatsoever they taught I taught also I don't think we could ever ever ever ever ever ever overestimate the importance of the Holy Ghost in our lives especially based on what he says here the people said to him after he said those words we know that the people cried and we know that we're going back to Earth with you sometime Jesus will come and judge you according to the words you preached us then you will present us to him and all together we will go back to Earth to live forever huh and thanks be to God that it will be a renovated Earth it will be all renovated by then he says I asked do I have to go back to Earth now they answered yes but keep pressing on as I began to move from that beautiful joyful place as far as my eyes could see people were coming towards me to embrace me crying my precious brother can you imagine that just as far as your eyes can see people suddenly I was back on the bed again I said oh God help me never let me compromise with the word let me stay straight on the word I don't care what anyone else does Lord let me press on to that beautiful joyful place and you know I'm probably not going to say a whole lot more tonight I'll call the musicians now and I'm just going to read a little tiny bit more he goes on to say I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy says hallelujah whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love it's love how he gives this instruction it's not it's not nebulous it's not unclear it's not confusing it's simple and and and understandable whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love if you're not saved accept Jesus Christ as your savior now if you have not been baptized in water be baptized now if you have not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit I love what he says here receive it now [Music] he doesn't say get it no because it's not something that you go out and get but you simply receive it once you've met the requirements just receive it now press on in that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time Hallelujah glory to God Amen maybe stand with me tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're just so thankful for your word so thankful for the word that you would give to us Lord that would be spirit in print form Lord Jesus to know that you have chosen the the base things of this world to express yourself in Lord Jesus the the simple things in this life Lord you haven't chosen the great things to express yourself in and through Lord I believe that's how every one of us feel when when we get your true Holy Spirit In Our Lives it causes a true humility because we recognize that there's nothing that we could ever have done to Merit your favor it's only by your grace that we're saved through faith not of Works lest any man should boast only your Amazing Grace Lord father I don't understand why you took it tonight this way but father I do know this that really the only thing that's going to make it there is perfect love and I believe that maybe that's the only message
