========================================

thank you I'm glad on Thursday I called the pastor and said I felt led to read a poem because the way I was feeling this morning I wouldn't be standing here but I had already committed so this poem is called kingdoms it's based on the idea of free moral agency and how we can choose daily though we're Sons and Daughters of God which kingdom we give Credence to do we let our crop DNA rule or do we choose to give our Heavenly DNA preeminence for a long time I thought you know what does it mean to give God preeminence and we know Christ is the Living Word and if you truly want to give God preeminence you have a little spark in your heart Let It Grow and flourish that is truly given God preeminence that is the Living Word here we go choose you this day Heaven or Hell two kingdoms stand with differing spells Satan's realm were Shadows creep and God's domain where Faith runs deep in Satan's Eden Up Is Down in chaos reigns with an eerie frown deception flourishes twisted and cruel where wickedness thrives a venomous fuel but in the kingdom of God light does shine a sanctuary of love Oh So Divine where truth prevails Triumph and bold and Mercy's Tale in every heart's told opposing forces these Realms do share a battle on scene Beyond Earthly glare Satan's Temptations so enticingly sowing while God's grace and blessings perfect love honing trials in God's kingdom a blessing to find a pathway of growth to clear the mind each obstacle faced strength is revealed Faith deepened wounds healed and courage unsealed but in Satan's Dominion nothing but despair punishment's cruel burdens too hard to bear Temptations like snares lore Saul souls to fall desperation Echoes In darkness's thrall yet through these dichotomies a lesson we glean that blessing spring from trials unforeseen for in God's plan resilience is found Victory emerges with a triumphant sound for in sorry so let us Choose Wisely the kingdom we embrace through our decisions lay predestinations Chase in God's kingdom trials evoke growth and might while in Satan's grasp nothing but bruising blight Up Is Down and Down is up the great Paradox that fills eternity's little hiccup blessed is the kingdom of God a beacon so true it shall guide us steadfastly in all that we do Lord bless you all [Applause]
