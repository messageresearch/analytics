Jesus and but during the week I was just pondering over that Sam 150 and how David was sitting on the same praise the Lord with the harp with the with the sound of the trumpet with the team bro with organ and I wondered you know why would God just be interested in musical instruments and then I remembered also in the Book of Revelation that's in heaven they have the Hop they have these instruments God enjoys our voices but he also enjoys the instrument so uh bear with me this morning the song is I must tell Jesus [Music] um [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

Lord [Music] amen Brothers it was wonderful this morning I really appreciate the exhortation by Brother Toby as well how the scripture talks about instruments that's so true there's one that talks about and oh brother many many years ago but the Kim dingwall reminded me of that it says play with a loud noise I believe there will be no silence in heaven when we're there and we will sing and worship with who knows what instruments we'll have there but we're trusting the Lord that we'll be able to give him the praise that he's worthy of across another land but in the meantime here we are today thank you my brothers it was wonderful thank you brother miles really appreciate the organ thank the Lord for just putting it on your heart to to uh to take up that instrument I know you've got many many talents and it just always amazes me how talented you you are but I thank the Lord you're giving it to the Lord It's a Wonderful Wonderful blessing I'm sure to your parents to all of us we certainly thank you for it God bless you stand with me if you would if you've got it along on the song service this morning but I believe God has received praise now let's give him praise with our ears and listen and hear and understand as our pastoral always talks about not just but the Holy Ghost in us but the Holy Ghost working through us and may the word have that effect on us as we hear the word this morning that this next week as our brother prayed that we give our best to the Lord Jesus praise be his name this morning you are beautiful beyond description well you are beautiful beyond description brother Mervin would you come oh tomorrow [Music] [Music] [Music] who can fathom the depths of your love oh you are beautiful beyond descriptions [Music] [Applause] [Music] all

work comprehend nothing ever [Music] your Infinite Wisdom who can battle the depths of Your Love you are beautiful me on [Music] the majesty and true [Music] [Applause] [Music] all praises [Music] amen we're so blessed people this morning amen while you are standing maybe if let's check if uh I have a lot of uh slides here I hope you will not get bored but uh when you're talking about the word and the message you must be not bored at all because these are life amen and uh I was just thinking of uh uh maybe this is this could be a sequel to the the one that I preach in let bridge but uh there are only few families that went there so this time I'll uh I put the the code so that we can prove that time it's not it didn't come from me it came from the prophet of this age and we'll just putting them together right so that we know what we're talking about is the truth nothing but the truth because when when it is that said the Lord through the prophet we cannot reason out amen and uh he pointed out as to the absolute always which is the word which is Christ himself amen Anna since uh while you're standing maybe let's read the first first verse here actually my topic is thank you musician sorry it yeah you can keep that one yeah that will be best for me amen so uh I entitled this uh sermon or preaching or teaching combined right the process of the Rapture in the bride amen and uh yeah I put a lot of uh uh verses and quotes So that at least we can go hopefully we can finish in before 12 or something but if not then maybe The Minister's other ministers can pick it up but this one is an important thing and it's an exciting uh topic because this is what we're longing for amen there's a reason why we come to church right is to have this complete body change and we know it's a process amen you were not born and then right away you're an adult right it maturing there's a maturing process you can say so let's read the first Thessalonians uh uh four 15 to 18. for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive praise the Lord are you are you alive this morning and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen let's bow our hearts this morning oh God we need your anointing Lord we know you're already present from the start of the service Lord you have set the atmosphere Lord and we just want our hearts now to be open to receive your word completely Lord without any doubt because without even just one person doubt it will affect the whole thing because your word is pure therefore we want it to be a to be received completely without any hesitation without any doubt without any compromise oh God may you anoint my lips Lord lips of clay that just formed and I want to set aside myself so that you can speak to me I will just be your mouthpiece this morning oh Lord that your your your bride your your people Lord this morning will be blessed and then they would know who they are oh God very important thing Lord that this spiritual Amnesia will just be gone will be healed by by the feeling of your word by the preaching of your word oh God me may you bless the service from beginning to end and whoever will be streaming Lord and and the the people who are present in person here in the service Lord will will will just enjoy your word and the message of the hour Lord because the message of the hour is Christ in US completely it has been prayed several times we know all these words Lord May Quicken into our hearts Lord by receiving your full word this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen so uh this this is a background of uh the timeline that I've been preaching many times in different places but then the thing is if you want to know where you are check the you you must know the time where you're living in and and besides always it's being uh it's being said in the word and in the message that the the the the the the evidence of having the Holy Ghost is the ability to receive the word for your day amen it means it's important to know the message for our day amen and and came through the seventh angel messenger of Malachi for we know that I'm speaking to Believers this morning I believe amen and then we'll just uh we'll check how it goes and and my the topic is uh the the process of the Rapture in the bride and let's let's define some terms a process means it is composed of different steps before it can be perfected or before it can be completed the simple meaning of a process so it means it must undergo certain steps right so being a child if you are born then you have uh how how can you mature you have to eat feed and uh you will grow as uh as time passes and it's a process you can say it's a timeline right so and how about Rapture Rapture random or even the Bible said you cannot find it in the in the word the mean the the Rapture itself the the word rapture itself but it but it means meeting in the air body chains and then meeting in there that's a Rapture but then it's a process didn't say the Rapture is a process but then he said he put it in different uh perspective like for example the new bird the new bird is uh in physical form or natural it's a uh the water when when a woman gives birth right the the water will break first and then the blood and then the life it's the same as the new birth spiritual you have to undergo justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost we know that's the the completeness but then at the same time because we're Eternal people be predestinated before the foundation of the world completion it it doesn't mean that you're done at that time because you have to go through eternity amen like uh when you say Justified uh Justified Sanctified baptized with the Holy Spirit then you have to live the full word and because in new Heaven and even when we cross uh when we cross a millennium because the bride will only be the one who will be considered in the Rapture amen and and it's through the message of the hour only because this message is for Rapture right it's a the rupturing faith lies on the message of this hour but then at the same time we have to also think of what Brian Brandon is saying rapturing grace we have to be gracious as well because there are other people on this Earth that might not be bright but they will be in the in in the second Resurrection Amen in eternity because it's not only for the bride you can say the uh they are outside the city there are other people the people that we meet in the school at work whatever we are giving them opportunity amen that's why the bride's Ministry is very important it has a purpose and it's a very very important purpose amen and this is uh imparting life you can say I don't want to be ahead of myself but uh let's let's try I'll be watching that clock and hopefully we can finish it so that so there are six raptures in the Bible uh in in the message the Rapture random uh clearly uh uh discuss them so the first one was Enoch you can see that in the in Genesis 5 24 that's Before the Flood that's in 3017 BC this is a timeline you can see that uh it's just like a time travel so that this we can enjoy where we are right so I'm just so passionate with timelines because uh almost everything that we we studied it's uh it's about time and that's the reason why we're called anti-message Believers because brother Branham identified that we are at the end so end time that's why we're called end time message Believers so bear with me I hope you will be bored with the with this presentation but uh uh just bear with me this little thing that I put together I hope it will be a blessing amen the first is eno right that's Before the Flood and then who's the second one Elijah that is in 896 BC Second Kings to 11. that's the second Rapture brother Branham was saying and then the the third one is uh Jesus himself right in uh it's about 33 A.D because uh the ministry of uh Jesus Christ started when he was 30 and for three and a half years that's the first half of the 70 week of Daniel that's not our topic today but it falls in that it's related to it and that is uh in Acts 1 9 to 11 that's 10 days before the Pentecost right so uh uh he was there when when he resurrected for 40 days he showed himself to his disciples and then uh that's the third uh the Rapture then the Old Testament Saints we know it's the same time with Jesus Christ around 33 A.D that's after Jesus death you can find that in Matthew 27 50-53 when uh when he gave up the ghost you know you know the story there and then uh the Rocks were opened the uh The Grapes were opened and and the sleeping Saints of the Old Testaments Old Testament came alive right why because they were waiting for the perfect sacrifice right and who's that perfect sacrifice is Jesus Christ himself right so when he came and then gave up the ghost so all the saints in the Old Testaments they woke up amen that's uh that's in Matthew 27 52-53 amen that's what Barbara Branham was saying amen and the fifth one which is US amen this is for the New Testament Saints which is the Bride of the seven Church ages it started from uh Ephesus onwards right including the apostles amen uh this is the uh the this Encompass anyone that died after Jesus Christ resurrected when they were still alive at that time then they cannot be raptured because they're still alive right so but uh during that uh time period from Seven Church Asia even with the apostles up to the last age this age we are waiting for this Rapture which is uh the the verse that we read in first Thessalonians 4 amen we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which are asleep anyone that were already that was already dead during the seven Church ages they are just waiting for us to be perfected amen so that's why let's not hinder them right we need to look for the last predestinated seed that's the reason why we're we're doing this amen we because we cannot be perfected without even the last predestinated seed because Christ will or God will not be perfect without that Single Seed that that is missing amen who knows where where he or she is right now who knows who he he might not have been born how long it would be we don't know but we know there is a promise for us amen so that's the PIP Rapture that's for us then the sixth one is Moses and Elijah of Revelations 11. this is after I don't know if it's clear enough for you here but uh I know in in in in the streaming might be very clear uh you can see in here Moses and Elijah Revelations 11. this is at the end of the three and a half years tribulation before the Millennium will will set in amen so these are the six raptures saying so three in the Old Testament that included Jesus Christ and three in the New Testament amen because the Old Testament is by law and uh the New Testament is by Grace amen and that's why we should be the most gracious people on Earth otherwise we will be uh judging people oh help us Lord amen so so let's uh let's continue so just just to read the message the Rapture here uh it is come a paragraph 152 to 153 1965 the Rapture now it's the first thing is the sounding the first thing is a it's a shout and then a voice and then a trumpet shout a messenger getting the people ready amen the second is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice that allowed Boys in Saint John 11 38 to 44 that called Lazarus from the grave that's the second step it's a process right so the first step is a shout the voice and then getting the brain together and then the resurrection of the Dead Sea to be caught up with it now watch the three things takes place the next is what a trumpet a shout a voice and a trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which is always at the Feast of the trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that will be the bride's supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky amen Let's uh let's be thankful on on those coats amen and then to understand the uh further I I put the timeline of the three comings of Jesus Christ also this it has been prayed several times in this Pulpit also and wherever we uh we listen to first coming Janda Baptist for around the first coming the second coming the second coming and then we must know that the second coming is also a timeline let's let's try to to check it amen the first coming is to redeem his bride amen that is from birth to Calvary that's Jesus Christ himself amen that's the first coming of Jesus Christ the second coming is to catch away his bride which is the rapture from Pentecost to the seven Church ages so you can see it's a timeline after Jesus Christ left and then up to today until the the catching away that's the second coming of Jesus Christ so it's a timeline you cannot just say it's just one time that's why when we talk about appealing and coming they're all talking about the same thing but then you have to put the timeline together so that you will not be confused did he already come yes he came in a spirit form he's living through us right now right and what are we waiting for is the Trump of God which is the married supper amen meeting in the air the full body chains but the body change as we say it's a body change is a rupture so it's a process the more we eat the more we grow right amen so I'm putting something as uh as the Lord leads me Charles Spurgeon it's about process right about maturing he was asked one time in his day he was asked what is more what what is more important reading the Bible or praying you know what he answered which is more important to you breathing in or breathing out amen what a beautiful reality right that's why you can see that that's why the song it's so important read your Bible and pray every day as you grow grow right it's not only for children it's also for us adults we need to feed and pray feed and pray feed and pray you can never overemphasize the importance of prayer that's why you can never out do praying you can always pray and you can always feed the word and it's the same as the wool uh the Sheep he just needs it just needs to feed and the wool will just come out amen so we need that right breathing in breathing out to live amen so that's the second part I'm just putting something here as we go the second coming of Jesus Christ is from after Jesus Christ left and then up to the catching away amen how about the third coming it's it's to reign with this bride in the millennium that's the third coming of Jesus Christ and and that's through the the full Millennium itself amen that's the third coming of Jesus Christ so uh we we are more interested on the second coming because that's where our parties in the third coming we will we will be with him when we come down right with him uh we will be under the souls of the faith of those who who are not Believers right uh and uh we will live with him in the Millennium for for a hundred years and then we cross eternity later on okay so let's uh Let's uh back that up with with codes right in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride Jesus comes three times so you can see anything that I put I must find it in the message right so at least I he will tell me it's my own idea that's a denomination if I put my own idea forgive me if if I do I'm ready to to uh to uh uh repent if I make mistakes forgive me I'm just your brother here and we we must be having this Liberty together right so even even only 12 people are here including myself but then those who are streaming I don't know who they are but I believe you'll this these are Word of Life right this is the word of life so Jesus comes three times and we must base our life accordingly because when we say we're message Believers we have to check what the message say and it must line up with the Bible amen Jesus comes three times come once to redeem his bride that's that's what we we checked a while ago next time to get his bride that is to redeem uh to to to rupture his bride to cut to catch his bride next time with his bride amen so that's that's the first uh uh quote but there's so many I I just put the the most important one so far now notice and this the coming of Jesus to 60 times it's bright he comes the next where caught up in the air to meet him in the air we caught up to meet him he comes to receive his bride the next time he comes he comes as king and queen to Reign on the earth with his bride three comings right amen so you see three comings so at the same time these three comings we have to understand the sonship of Jesus Christ because sonship is not Eternal said it clearly because asan is begotten therefore it has a beginning if it has a beginning it has an ending amen but then he's Eternal we know he's eternal by the person of being uh being a god it's the same as us being the bride of Christ we are also Eternal beings but we we were born here in this Earth so therefore we have an end but then the thing is the body the theophany that we have that will be changed later on is eternal it's a and then when we accepted the message actually even before the foundation of the world that seed was implanted because of his foreknowledge he predestinated us to be sons and children of God and to be a bride on a different level of uh perspective they're the same it's about Redemption amen it's about going back to him amen what a beautiful reality okay sonship of Jesus Christ so the first he came as a son of man there are so many verses here can you read it I don't know I'll just mention it Matthew 13 57 Matthew 21 11 Luke 24 19 Jan 4 19 acts 7 37 son of man Ministry is a prophet he came as himself Jesus Christ himself when he became the lamb that is uh ready to be sacrificed on the cross amen that's the son of man Ministry a prophet amen Son of God that's the Holy Ghost dispensation it's in John 14 16-20 and John and John 16 7-13 amen that's the Holy Spirit dispensation amen so and then the third sonship it is called son of David it's in you you can find it uh he will rule uh as a king in the Millennium and we are his bride amen and that that can be found in Revelations 17 to 14 17 verse 14 Revelations 19 16. First Timothy 6 15 Jeremiah 23 5 Isaiah 9 7. okay he will be king in the Millennium but this is the important one this is for us actually we've been preaching Barry was also preaching about this and many other ministers the son of man before that so he before this uh being a son of David Ministry in the Millennium there will be a little season here uh which is for us including the including brother Branham of course because he's our leader he's our he's our messenger for the for the AIDS son of man Luke 17 30 and Revelation 10. let's read the the verses support our supporting quotes Okay does God change his mind 1965 uh April 27. now Jesus said just before the coming of the Son of God or the the second coming that this age that we lived through he come as son of man a prophet amen because that fulfills the scripture Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me we all know that was Jesus don't we amen so we had to come according to the scripture a prophet he never called himself the son of God he called himself the son of man a prophet but now he is through the church age now he has been Son of God in the Millennium he'll be son of David sitting on David's throne but between this time and we find out by the scriptures he is to reveal himself again as son of man a prophet amen between this time if you check this thing but now he is through the church age now he has been Son of God in the Millennium but he'll be son of David sitting on David's throne but between this time we find out by the scripture is to reveal himself again a son of man a prophet because the word of the Lord comes to prophets only never to theologians it is the prophets and the Lord said he did nothing in his unchanging word we just talked about until first he shows His prophets at the end time them Seven Seals that this bride has sealed up the Sevenfold mysteries of all Christ has to be revealed first and it can only be brought to a prophet we've been looking for that for years and we believe that his spirit is Among Us now when now amen we find so this is 1965 but uh we're we we are the beneficiaries of this message and we've been uh we believe this by all of our hearts I believe otherwise we won't be here amen so that's why you see uh all this Revelations that came through that prophet of Malachi for Revelations 10 7 it's in us now right right now and uh we're just continuing it amen so so you can see son of man Son of God Son of David but between the Son of God and Son of David like what he said it's a son of man ministry again before the Millennium so it's very important when when when brother Branham is saying that because actually this one was corrected by Brother Ken I'm so thankful that brother can just cross-examine everything because uh I believe everyone should do that but then the thing is that's that's what we need to do because we were given a very good or very strong message very very powerful opening of the word then we must live accordingly right we must we must feed on it and uh and and check if if there's an error let's accept it right because correction is part of growing growing up right so we need to do that as brothers and sisters that's why we need the we're so thankful uh in with this church that it recognized the fivefold ministry other churches they don't right it's only it's either they just play tapes they're thinking that's the fivefold although the fivefold ministry is under the prophet of this age we're preaching this the message and the Bible under the prophetic Ministry of uh uh Malachi 456 uh and and the prophet which is very Branham right so the question now is can you get raptured without this message it's it's I can say it's no because the thing there is the the opening of the word like Phil preached last Wednesday right it was not revealed to to all the ages even at the seventh loudish here with suspentecostal but during the bride it got revealed totally and uh we'll we'll check on that right so you can see son of man Son of God Son of Man now and before that and then it will go to Millennium but you can see this this small thing here the son of man Ministry Luke 17 30 Revelations 10. let's enlarge it amen so uh this is composed of the seven Church ages you can see after Jesus Christ left so there's around 20 because 33 A.D he left and then uh Church ages started at 53.80 so there's about 20 years of Gap when when uh offices started right so that's the seven Church ages up to here this is the seventh Church ages up too loud this year but then I want to cross-examine dissect this uh small thing here so let's enlarge it okay Okay so if you can see it's it started in 1963 up to today that's the first Thessalonians 4 16 because the seven seal was opened in 1963. right when we'll discuss more on this Cloud because this is a very controversial one but get just revealed it to me while studying it to to put something into perspective I might be wrong but uh it looks uh when you checked further you would know that uh this cloud has very good significance in I mean it's an important milestone for this message amen because if you don't have this how would you uh put or tie things together right the seven seal Revelations 10 1 and he was the one descending We Will We Will dissect that one by one later so so you can see if we put the shout voice and trumpet in a timeline it started from 1963 up to today but then the thing is if you will check 1963 to 1965. that because if if the seals were opened actually they were opened even before Revelations five but then it was handed over to Briar Branham when he opened in March 17 1963. he was just revealing what was open because the the the mighty angel that came with this hand an open book so it means the sales were already loose but then what's the content of those sales it has to be rebuilt to profits that's why every day Branham is on that uh little room there and then he's praying and then all his thoughts were changed by by the Holy Spirit by the pillar of fire every time but then we're so blessed because he he corrected it through the prophet that's why it's so important to understand that we need a prophet right for this AIDS we we cannot just uh we cannot just say oh it's already revealed to me how it was revealed to you it's through the prophet Amos 37 very important amen so so you can see 1963 to 65 that's the shout and then it's continued with the voice actually shout shout is a loud voice right what is a shout when you're when someone is uh uh is in trouble you have to shout hey get out of there it's you'll be in trouble so it's a voice that came out right so a shout is a loud voice and then brother Branham was taken of the sin because Jesus Christ must increase same as what John the Baptist uh uh in John the Baptist ministry because Jesus Christ is already there right so he must decrease so that Jesus Christ can increase so in this case Brian branham's Ministry he already uh being the uh elizar he already introduced Christ to us and we are married to Christ already so he must decrease so that Christ can come out of us we're being impregnated by the word of God so that we can be full full grown matured matured person in the in the uh representing Christ in this world Amen that's that's the maturing process we will uh represent Christ up to the up to the trumpet amen up up to the Trump of God meeting in the air so that's the ministry we have it's so important amen I cannot over emphasize so 1963 to uh to present is the voice Ministry and we're continuing that after brother Branham left and now the trumpet which is the actual literal coming it's a question mark because we don't know the exact hour right so who who can say even even brother Branham he said the I predict I don't prophesy it's 1977 but it didn't it didn't happen naturally but then spiritually we know it happened because uh uh America became dark the world became dark you see what's happening right now it's oh it's so dark in this world right now that the only light is because of the presence of the Bride amen so this Trump this actual Rapture but then the thing the whole thing is a process we received the message of the hour and the voice that is in the bride right now is continuing and preaching to the lost but the bride will accept only the bride will accept this message because this is a this is a rapturing message amen uh all those denominational thing including the Pentecostal because uh I I would say even even here I will prove to you with many many uh scripture many quotes that we are at the bride age we've been telling that we're at the bride it's we're at the bride age let's let's be open right and then uh enjoy what brother Branham said and then let's compile them together amen so seven Church ages so you can see here the cloud it's in Revelation 10. and uh uh the church is just up to load this year but then let's continue so the son of man Ministry is the bride age you can say because this one is where when the seals were opened then you're living you can say because you're you're Eternal bound even though you die you still gain to live with Christ to die his game whether you die or you live it doesn't matter because you're just changing Dimension right and and the and when the word was fully manifested and and and uh and opened up even Daniel like brother Phil was preaching it was not even allowed for him to to uh to reveal it and to write it seal it up up to this end and we're so thankful Branham is saying what age do you want to live I want to live in this age because it's the Golden Age although it's a difficult age we can we can find there's so many distractions it's so hard to focus is saying the only reason why we're still here is because the bride is taking care I mean uh thinks of the cares of this world right one of the reasons you can say we think so much of the cares of this world that uh we're losing focus and we're so thankful God is doing something in this church you can see the the progression here Bradbury is uh it will be he will be a full-time pastor and uh you you can see that and of course uh uh like what I've said the fivefold ministry is so important and we we are very thankful that he recognized that and uh and and we know Ephesians 4 11 is for the perfecting of the Saints edification of the church right until we come in unity and we will find in this last age that all the ministers must be United it must not be a a show or whoever is better or what right we need each other and even brother Branham said the bride has a Ministry the bride meaning everyone even though those who are not uh behind this Pulpit he said is composed of this fivefold right so I I believe it that's it is the rising of the sand anyway so you can see Let's uh so uh I put something here because God just revealed this to me while while reading about this Cloud because it's very controversial they're saying because uh the cloud was photographed February 20 1963. but then that at that time Branham was not uh in uh was not hunting yet because the time for hunting it's March 1st to March 10th I believe I I did the research here bear with me I so in 1963 it is uh March 1st to March 10th that's the javelina hunting season in Arizona okay but the the photograph was taken February 20 1963. so those who are Skeptics those who who are defectors of this message they they put that as a big deal because this one this cloud is a very important uh uh milestone in the message and an important event right so I put together something so let's discuss a little bit uh February 28th This Cloud was photographed as a live magazine I believe and then brother Branham in his uh uh life story you can see he was hunting March 8th March 8th with the with brother Gene Norman brother saltman right that's uh when the vision of uh seeing a cockleberry on his pants right and then there was an explosion that's March 8th so it means he's not against the law he's not violating any law because other people are saying if Brian Branham was their February 28 it means he's violating the law because it it must be March 1st to 10th but then you can see in his life story he even went to to Houston first before going uh uh you know before coming back right and then have that hunting Javelin hunting okay let's let's do some principles so remember that February 8th evening that's when the the uh the cloud was photographed and then March 8th that's when the vision was fulfilled that Vision was mentioned in the is this the time of the answer right so that is in 1962 I believe in uh that is this the time of the end uh okay there you go uh bear with me okay December 30 1962. he is not sure of what that vision is all about about that explosion right but uh uh is it is going to be dead and uh but he's asking the Lord for for for uh for answers right so he he didn't know but then the thing is that that hap he explained that vision and then in March 8 that Vision was fulfilled okay let's uh so February 28th to March 8th okay so let's uh let's do some prophetic time principle so in in Ezekiel 4-6 and when thou has accomplished them lie again on thy right side and thou shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah 40 days I I have appointed the each day for a year just for background here and then in numbers 1434 after the number of the days in which he searched the land even 40 days each day for a year shall you bear your iniquities even 40 years and you shall know my bridge or promise if you check these two scriptures you can deduce or conclude that one day is one year prophetically because there are other prophetic principles like one day is a thousand years and so on and one week is seven years right so but for this one we we just want to check hindsight because uh we're we're students of this message and the Bible we we need to check if we're really interested in that let's just check right so I might be wrong but uh bear with me if I'm not but the thing there is uh we just try to prove something here so prophetic time principle so one day and what is one year okay so half an hour space in Revelations eight one to two let's read it all together uh it's there anyway and when he had opened the seventh seal there was a silence in the heaven about the space of half an hour and I saw the seven angels which stood before God amen so let's do something calculation right it's a bit of a Sunday school and then let's do some mathematics as well so half an hour is uh half an hour is 0.5 hour right so if we uh if we multiply one day to 24 hours right and then one year per day that's our principle a while ago multiplied by 360 days per year for a prophetic day what will be the result seven and a half days so now I'm just deducing from February 28 1963 evening to March 890s because uh that Vision was fulfilled the blast it's around 8 8 in the morning so but the the photograph was was taken 1963 evening so let's count February 28th that's already evening March 1st second third fourth fifth sixth seventh and then on the 8th in the morning so how many days are those seven and a half so while it is photographed it's between the Earth and Heaven it's on the bridge right and then at the seven and a half day brother Branham was caught up by the seven angels right so I'm having Goosebumps now because the thing is I'm just trying to prevent them when I was reading it I was so thankful that oh Lord thank you for such thing I mean can you disprove it now I mean even by calculation right so even this is similar to the 70 weeks of Daniel where where brother Branham was saying but then he corrected it but then you have to put together so that because brother randomly is a Vindicated Prophet right he might it might not have been rebuilt previously but then God corrected him later on after the opening of the seals but we don't correct Branham we he is corrected by the word amen we don't have that authority to correct him it's the word that will correct him amen so seven and a half day so it was photographed and then at March 10 on March 8th he was caught up so if you check it's it's almost perfect about space of half an hour the the Bible is saying it's not exact about about the space of half an hour it didn't say exactly half an hour but then the thing when you calculate it with prophetic Ministry with the principles in the Bible it's exactly seven and a half hours amen who I'm so I'm so thankful I just thought that I have to put this I just bought it today well while in that room because the thing there is it just came to me last night and then oh I have to put it at least at least to prove that the cloud is a Vindicated cloud and that's Jesus Christ himself descending amen and then and at the same time if you check the second verse here and I saw the seven angels we stood before God who are those seven angels the seven Church age Messengers amen the Perfection you can see amen and that's why that's why those who are thinking that the the seven the the seven seal is not open yet let's let's think about this one maybe just put you on on a thinking uh uh Pro as a student perspective you always question something right you want to prove something when when Jesus Christ came down Revelation 10 1 he already brought the open book so it means all the Seven Seals are already loose because otherwise it's not open but then it was handed over to to Briar Branham although you mentioned uh the first seal was open the second seal was open but actually the book was open but in Revelations 5 it was still closed but then when he descended and then this this uh uh this cloudus Photograph that's the thing that we will cross-examine Revelations 10 1-7 verse five verse later if we have time 11 30. so let's uh let's move on I'm just so thankful uh uh with Revelation amen so let's continue so so March 28 96 today evening to March 8 1963 morning that's exactly seven and a half days so uh so going back to our topic actually uh the reason why I put all these things is uh to to understand what the bride means right because uh we are bride of Jesus Christ we always say that because it's in the message but then we have to know what it means because there are different definitions and we must put the proper definition right where we belong okay I mean where where uh where it is applicable to us okay so definition of the bright by Noah Webster 1828 it's a woman newly married so the topic is still the process of the Rapture in the bride right so it's important to know what a bride means uh that but the name is applied to a woman at the marriage Festival before she is married as well as after the ceremony so that's a woman newly married a woman a spouse or contracted to me to be married is also a bride but in in our context if you already accepted the message and it's being in process right now then you're not espoused or contracted to be married you're already married amen and we'll prove that by by many quotes let's let's do some uh some study here by Strong's uh uh Strong's Bible concordance it's in Hebrew 3618. the first one it's called Kala so from it's it's called a bride as if perfect hence a son's wife bright daughter-in-law spouse so it means uh this is the the Hebrew meaning about in Greek it's called nymphet from a primary but obsolete verb a young married woman as well including a betroth Girl by implication a son's wife bride daughter-in-law so you can see uh it just proved that Noah's dictionary is correct there there are different definitions and uh in Spanish they call it Novia actually brother uh who's that brother Aaron McGarry preached that I think one time in uh in bar Chad's thing because uh in Spanish they called them Novia but actually a Novia means a bride a woman on her wedding day a girlfriend a person's regular romantic companion or fiance a woman to whom someone is engaged so in checking this which one is applicable to us right a person's regular romantic a woman to whom someone is engaged a woman on her wedding day so on wedding day but then for us I want to proceed with this so that we can check Revelations 19 7-9 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the merits of the lambis camp and his wife had made herself ready and her was granted that she should be a raid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the married supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God why why I am I am emphasizing this is because the Rapture which is the Trump is going to the marriage supper we're not going to the wedding we're going to the marriage supper amen and uh you see here the next proving his word uh now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty showing and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now what's close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to do to join the church to the Head unite very important word unite the marriage of the Bride amen the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifesto manifestation of the revealing of the son of man that's why now it's so important to put the things together we are in the son of man Ministry in the bride right now let's continue not a clergy man I don't know do you see what I mean see it's son of man Jesus Christ will come come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it will unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper right amen she's already United very important she's already united we have already the consummation see we go to the Mary the wedding supper not to the marriage fill your flesh self of all the Flesh of mighty man because the merits of the Lamb has come but the rapture amen Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the Lord when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and when they does it and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the world and the church Capital C very important it's not the small C amen becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing amen very powerful the invisible Union of the Bride oh that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day that's why it's a process day by day as we feed on the world amen we become the word amen because that seed belongs to him amen we just need to be in the presence of the Sun s-o-n so that we can mature amen why it's cumulate accumulating so fast out there in those deserts and things taking place that I couldn't even keep up with we're near the coming of Jesus to be United with this church where the word becomes the word called the call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts amen whoa so now uh let's summarize the marriage process by those coats let's let's put them together juice natural which is the sry lights and you spiritual the bride let's let's do I I reduce it to four steps so that this is easier the first step in a natural juice marriage is you have to have a decision right and then you can have an engagement and then you will go with the marriage ceremony and then you will have consummation that's the first step and then after that you go to the marriage supper which is the feast that's the second step right you're already United before going to the marriage supper amen and then after that what will you do you go honeymoon right and then after honeymoon you live together that's the process of the natural natural marriage how about the bride the first step is Christian maturity when you accepted Jesus Christ you will feed on the word which is the Bible until you become mature as a bride because Jesus Christ cannot marry an immature bride we have to be mature amen so so you can see there up to consummation it means Christian maturity to Invisible Union which is now when we feed on the word we are being united with him we are in consummation with him right we we are already married with him then we can go to the Second Step which is meeting in the air until the three and a half years of tribulation that's why we're going to the marriage supper not not to the marriage because we are already United otherwise we will commit fornication if we are not married and we are already being united with him amen it's so good also to know that a marriage is a marriage certificate typically it's not a marriage contract sometimes they use marriage contract because contract most of the time has end you're already married so once you're married with crisis forever amen meeting in the air and then what will happen in this meeting there and within these three and a half years Jesus Christ will reveal himself to the 144 000 and where is the pride at this time he's in the palace amen that's why the the the verse scripture used by Brother Branham I think is it Psalm 27 or Psalm 25 where he will hide me in his Pavilion while there's tribulation oh Bride of the Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ know who you are amen no let us know who we are because we are so privileged amen so this is the one we're waiting for right now but then after that the honeymoon is saying is the Millennium to rule with the ride of iron right and then Millennium the Time and Eternity will blend and that is the new Heaven and new earth the New Jerusalem amen isn't that beautiful if we if we if we put things into perspective amen we're so thankful amen so the bride age you can see Let's uh uh let's try to to read the most of the quotes So that at least we can finish something so we are in the bright age this is the this is the one we're waiting for and this one is happening right now right the shout and the voice it's only the Trump that we're waiting which is the married supper amen which is a gathering Feast amen so Ministry of the Bride in this last eight we know that uh this one and the voice which I heard I'll just read it so you don't need to open your your Bible revelations 10 8-11 and the voice which I heard from Heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand you see open in the hand of the angel with standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went on to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon I had eaten it my belly was bitter and then and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings if if we if we just do a quick one here there are three again three steps you have to eat the word right John is the type of the Bride he was the one who who took the open word open book from the angel it means he's feeding the word fully and then there's no there's no uh there's no more seals in it and he ate it right but then if you if you check uh verse 10 here in my mouth is sweet as honey because it's it's the message of the hour when you when it was revealed to you it's like so sweet in the mouth but then when you realize when you live according to it it's so bitter it's so hard to live according to the message of the hour because it's Perfection right but Perfection needs a lot of pruning it's like grape right when when you prune the grape it will bear more fruits so that that pruning is like tribulation amen or Affliction right in this in this uh or trials and sufferings all these things will perfect our character right and it's so important right it might be difficult but God is faithful and he doesn't see our sin because we are already covered by the blood and that is already effective amen but you have to accept it although he came for everyone but only the ones who will believe completely will be saved and have everlasting life but uh you can see a lot of people that don't believe in God right but I have mercy on them but we're so thankful God just revealed it to us meaning believe is a very very important word because it means you will receive the word completely you will act accordingly right there's no doubt that's why the the original sin is unbelief in the word of God that's why he said John 3 16 right believe in the word and you will be saved amen so it was bitter in the belly because you have to live according to the message but then the third one or maybe just to give a how how can you uh what's the antidote of this uh bitter in the belly you have to eat the word over and over again at least it will it will be combined with the sweet in the mouth and bitter in the belly then you will be used to it right so I you know bitter are good typically in the old days medicine are bitter right but now they change the the taste so that it's easy it can be easily taken by children right but even the the old people they don't want bitter things but then it's good for us right amen just a paraphrasing or whatever so but the 11th one you see what what what this is and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings prophesy again because all the previous ages they already prophesied even the the prophesied right but for us now prophesy again meaning preach again teach again we have to bring this message of the hour right to every person that we will meet then if they will accept it praise the Lord right but only the bride will accept this message of the hour that's uh Branham is so clear we are preaching to the lost right now but only the bride will accept amen so we must prophesy again to all people all nations tongues and Kings that's a strong thing that's why we have missionaries we have Apostles right so we need to reach we have evangelists all over the place we but if you cannot do it ourselves we have to send someone who who who who who can do that right and and I'm seeing a lot of baptisms still in the in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ everywhere then they have been their Facebook and and wherever so it means God's still calling amen and we're so thankful and we must extend that as much as possible amen so let's uh let's read the completely I have only 10 minutes or so let's ask Christ was the first one to raise this is it is the rising of the Sun from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruit first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ so much on this one in the bride this comma here it made a difference right bright coming of Christ this is this is our age but in the bride if you will check it with the Kama in the bride coming of Christ but actually when you hear it from maybe you can check it yourself you're English people so you you might understand it better than me uh so in the bright coming of Christ that's totally different when in the bride and then coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a shift wave in the last days Oh my he said waving off the ship that what was the shift the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wit that proved it was it was a chief Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waived over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there amen bright age this is proving the that we are in the bright age although what we see out there is love this year but I'm saying we're on top of love this year and we are leaving the bright age because we accepted this message of the hour amen let's continue the invisible Union of the Bride I'll just go with the 324. the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bright AIDS no more than the word of Noah would work in the days of Moses no more than Moses low would have worked in the day in the time of Paul here he tried to tell them you are dead to that and you cannot have that thinking of that the the message of Pentecost during the apostles the 120 people in in that Upper Room that message will not be enough for us that's the reason why they were not ruptured yet they are waiting for us because the word is not fully revealed at that time amen so we're so thankful although the message of Pentecost is the whole thing is for love this year but 1963 onwards we we as bright were lifted up and then we are now in living in this bright age with the full manifested word of the hour amen so let's continue I I have to rush here so uh I have heard but now I see you can see uh the Pentecostals I should say not none of the rest of them that's the shock on the wheat that come out look just exactly like the wheat but there was no wheat to it it opens up but the grain comes out of that amen they organize they kill themselves that's where they die their stocks but the wheat has come out through there and now it's begin to form in the bride form amen the corner that fell into the ground through Dark Ages it had to die there should be that so that there there can be life after and let's continue and then you see that critic saying why would the god of Mercy could open up the Red Sea stand and let them poor Christians eat up with lions and burnt and everything set up just like he laughed about fall into the ground it had to die through those Dark Ages like any other corn of wheat has to go beneath the Earth and be buried to bring forth in the First Reformation them two blades of Luther the stock it had to comfort in the Westlands out the under to bring forth the pollen the tassels the great missionary AIDS had to comfort in the Pentecostal for the restoration of the gifts almost to deceive the very elected the Pentecostal is so close to the message that it will deceive the very elect but then during our fellowship with brother Paul right now it's not uh it's not uh determining what uh I mean you will not be deceived by right and wrong because you know wrong exactly it's it's between deception of right and almost right amen because almost right is almost like the the the shock right you thought that it's the pure wit but then that's just a covering the the true City it's in inside and but it will deceive the very elect it possible but we're so glad it's not possible to be deceived amen because of this message of this hour for sure which is Christ in us the hope of glory the word will vindicate the word will will correct the air amen let's continue now it's begin to pull away the wits begin to be seen this is not Pentecostal age this is the latter day age this is the bride age this is the evening light this is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's partner pattern this is Luke 17 30 to be fulfilled amen this is second Jeremiah and all the rest of them that Joel has spoke of these days this is that day I am heard Lord and it was coming but now I see with my eye thank you Lord for that understanding amen maybe uh yeah uh let's read 56 here we're not living in a Pentecostal age this is in modern events uh uh made clear by prophecy we're living in another age see we're not living in the into in the matter this age we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bride age the calling out of the church Capital C and getting it together for the Rapture that's exact that's the age that we're now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth amen he said praise the Lord so I'll I'll uh there are so many uh there are so many quotes that you can just uh check just just put the bride age you will find it's just to prove that we are really in the practice because some some might be questioning it uh where's love this year then right we are on top of laodicea right because there are only seven Church ages so it means bright age even even when you think about it it's uh Branham called it in in the future room as the Eighth Day why because we are Eternal being it means whether you live or you die you will still go to to Millennium and then to Eternity so it means you're already Eternal Eternal bound amen that's why we're for us accepting the full message of the hour is eternity for us amen we're so thankful no wonder other people are misplacing that they're saying they're already living in the in in Millennium I I spoke with a person who who said that he's leaving the Millennium but I told him if that's the case did you change your body and then he if I put a knife on you you will you be hurt or will you bleed then he said yes so I believe Branham is so clear chains of body means you'll be in a glorified body amen so yeah so so all these things I I and I told him if you have an issue on on or or if just you heard this from somebody because they are preaching the two Soul Doctrine from from a person in in in in the US and then but the thing there no matter what Doctrine you've been you've been listening to you have to check the life of that person if it if it manifests the word and then they promote polygamy adultery so so how can you how can you follow such man and then we were in Zoom then we have a Bible study in very deep I told him brother I cannot impart Revelation to you but anything that you have a question let's put it together we are in Zoom I will I will put it on the screen tell me the code that you're talking about you know that's that's how it is right we we must we must be diligent in seeking knowing what the message is because it's on our fingertips anywhere you go even in your washroom or driving you can hear it and everything if you have doubt just press you know you check it that's the reason why it uh Branham really hated the nominationalism right because it's man over man right and we're so thankful that the uh Brian Branham just put that in the open even ourselves raken was preaching you can be a denomination of yourself if you have your own idea oh Lord help us today Lord that uh we will just remove all this denominational taking thinking we should empty ourselves so that the full word can come amen a fully surrendered vessel for a fully surrendered person is omnipotent why is if he is dead because Christ can or God can use him fully whether he put it on the left we will go left we will put it on the right he will go right he will not have any reasoning oh Lord I don't want to go there because they're Sinners oh if God commissioned us to go somewhere we have to do it if God say do this we have to do it amen as long as it's in the word amen and and God this uh he never changed he's the same yesterday today and forever and he will never fail amen if we have that seed that seed must come to pass mature must be quick and amen by the word amen who praise the Lord let me let me continue so uh it's almost 12 maybe maybe I'll call the musicians I'll just uh continue this I still have a lot of things here but uh let me let me just uh maybe I'll call the musicians uh maybe there's so many good parts here but I don't want to just run them down maybe next time I'll do it uh so maybe I'll just end this I know uh brother Brad Gilbert puts this last last time I guess just to to show some something here although we're talking about the bride and if he's mature but but then this thing is about full adoption also uh just just so that I can end it this way uh Genesis 25 1-6 then again Abraham took a wife and her name was Katura and she bear him zimran and jokshan and maiden and Midian and ishback and shua and jokshan began Shiba and didn't and the sons of dedan were assurim and letoshim and Liam and the sons of median IFA and Elda all these were the children of Keturah and Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac but Unto the Sons of the concubines which Abram had Abraham gave Gibbs and sent them away from Isaac his son while he had lived Eastward and to the East Country if you check on this Abraham which you say type of God right the father he gave all that he had unto Isaac right the the the promised son but and to the sons of concubines Keturah is a concubine before right but then when when uh uh when Sarah died he married him her he married him and then he he became Abraham's wife later on when when Sarah died but before that she was a concubine you can check that in Chronicles you see the sense of the concubines they have the gifts they were given gifts but to the son Isaac he gave all it's just like full adoption full Authority and power right it was given to us what else can we ask for full adoption right and then on the other end if you were a bride of Christ the secret is given to you right so Pride of the living God Amen Saints of the Living God brothers and sisters we must be so thankful and we must not doubt that we don't have the Holy Ghost sometimes because the thing is when it is given to us we are sealed until the day of our Redemption right although we make mistakes because we're still in the flesh but we are quick to repent because that's the character of a bride he doesn't want to make mistakes he want she wants to please her Lord she wants to please her God Amen forgive us when we fail but then we have a blood that is bleeding right now and we're covered under the blood but and Satan cannot go under it otherwise he will become a brother right he cannot do that but he's he's very uh you can say smart right he can put something and then fish you out of that blood so sometimes we fail or or we backslide but it doesn't mean but don't go outside that blood don't go outside that token don't go out because that's a dangerous ground amen because that blood we are sinners Say by Grace amen we were born uh shaping iniquity born speaking lies so it means our color is red right but then the blood of Christ red to red it will become white so he doesn't see us committing sin anymore right he he we make mistakes yes but we are covered by the blood but don't take this that you can always uh think that you can always do it because it's also said those who sin willfully right uh I think that is in Hebrews yeah right so we don't want to Sin willfully Sin means unbelief we don't want to unbelieve the world willfully Amen when we make mistake we must repent right now immediately amen so you see just closing here so that at least we know we are in the process of the rapture process means we must go we must undergo steps amen and and going steps is painful sometimes right but then we have to do it amen every single thing even adoption we must go process Assam cannot be given the The Inheritance right away without being tutored by the holy spirit amen until he matures and and be qualified to accept all those amen even the Rapture itself we have to know the full message right and then we are the voice of this generation continuing right imparting the word that is uh given to us amen and then uh we we look for that less predestinated City man if that that last predestinated cities already in the fold he must also mature right so there's a process amen and we must accept that uh when we have all these things God is in control God knows what we need amen and uh despite of what's Happening we know we we can have coffee we have kovid before brother Paul at covet but we have a Healer hey man what can we ask for that attribute must manifest in US amen so why do we need to worry why do we need to doubt right it's just Faith or doubt that's why that Soul it must that nature must change right the nature is not the soul itself that will that will die and uh or or will be changed with another Soul that's the that's the doctrine of the two Souls but then the thing is it's the it's the life that will that will that will count it will just prove what you received then amen the wool will come out automatic for us when we feed the word what will come out the fruit of the holy spirit amen love joy peace long-suffering gentleness fruit not fruits because when you have love you have everything beautiful I must stop that right now otherwise maybe next time we will continue God is good I hope you're blessed my brothers and sisters [Applause] 1200 messages if you think about it it's so huge this message is huge but it all boils down to one thing Christ in us the hope of glory amen Christ in us we will be the walking Christ we will be the walking word the walking epistle right read by all man when they see us wherever we go even at the in the office they will know that uh we are Believers of this word maybe I'll just uh I'll just give you I just uh remembered my boss because uh I think I mentioned that we were given a very big project again praise the Lord and then he told me somebody might be praying and he told me yeah whatever you're doing Marvin keep it because they know they go somewhere but then for me I I order juice pineapple juice they they do what they think in there and then they ask one time why do you don't drink I don't want I don't want to I'm done with that I told you okay and then they respect it but then the thing is and then they knew that uh I I attend church every Wednesday and Sunday and sometimes I preach oh you're a very religious man he said no it's just life for me I told him I told him and then and then he said after all this pandemic and loss of jobs all over Alberta and then we were given this major project only for our team and then he told me whatever you're doing do it just keep doing it I'm so thankful praise the Lord and that's the Lord amen we should not be ashamed amen of the of what we accepted amen because uh this is life for us this is our life and we must know who we are so that we can go Yonder amen
