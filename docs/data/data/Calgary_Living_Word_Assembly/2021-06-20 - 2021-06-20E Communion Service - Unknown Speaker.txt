you would just bless every single aspect of this service tonight Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen bless you thank you musicians we'll try not to keep everybody very long tonight I know we're still transitioning into two services on a Sunday and I know it's not easy especially with children as we wrap up the school year and all of the things going on in our lives tonight we know it's a special night it's a communion service the next time we do this it will be a communion foot washing according to the word not our own Doctrine tonight I'd like to read continue on with Saint John chapter 6. Saint John chapter 6 and we'll just start from where we read this morning verse 26 but we'll read a bit further tonight while you're turning there I'll just make a couple of announcements and that is that indeed brother Mervin will take the service next Sunday night and I truly apologize to everyone for just making it confusing I seem to be real good at that but uh I can admit it too so I apologize we'll have a schedule coming out and we'll just try and stick to the schedule um brother Gilbert had suggested that brother Mervin would take a a part two of what he preached the last time so it uh I think it'll work we'll just see what the Lord has in store for us so brother Mervin will take it and uh pray for him so we'll look for uh worship service as I spoke about this morning likely uh Sunday evening July the 11th we have some brothers that are going to be traveling and we want to make sure that as many people that can be here will be here there's some musicians that really want to be activity so I know it's kind of all over the place but the words that I spoke tonight will be reflected in the calendar so we'll try not to deviate from that and uh we trust that it will just be a blessing to everyone tonight in our scripture let's read from Saint John chapter 6 verse 26. Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the Miracles but because ye did eat of the Loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him have him what shall we do that we might that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent they said therefore unto him what sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee what does thou work I just have to stop there and just remind everyone these are the people that just watched him break the bread multiply the loaves show us a sign and we'll believe come down off that cross and we'll believe these weren't believers they said our fathers did eat man and the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I say unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me will I know Wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but I should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him leaveth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day you can imagine as he's speaking it's becoming more and more and more personal he will raise him up he will raise him up and then he starts to transition to I Will Raise them up verse 41 the Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which come down from heaven and they said is this is is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith I come down from heaven it could be the same thing for us brothers and sisters if we have a brother and sister that has a revelation from God be careful if it lines up with the word we don't want to be judging them right how easily we can shift into the carnal realm and judged spiritual things we don't want to do that verse 43 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I it's and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father come unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god and he hath seen the father verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life I am that bread of life you could imagine he's just stirring him up here by now these people are getting some agitated by these words but he doesn't just stop there he says your verse 49 your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world verse 52 the Jews therefore strove amongst themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto him verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth of My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he did he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat Manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they heard this they said this is a hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them Duff this offend you what if ye shall see the son of man Ascend up to where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not let's just bow in prayer one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we're just so thankful for your word we're thankful for the Bread of Heaven we're thankful for the Revelation that you have given us of that bread Lord Jesus tonight we pray that you would just break it to us once again just a little bit further Lord that you would just Quicken it to our very Souls that when we leave this service tonight we would not be the same we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you tonight you may be seated as I said I won't take a long time I don't want to keep everyone late but I just felt so inspired to go into this this scripture tonight to look at this these these people are the ones that saw Jesus perform the miracle and and here we are hearing them say to him what what work will you give us what sign will you give us you must have a sign to show us that you know these words that you're talking about are actually true and and he just he didn't he didn't mince words with them they were speaking carnally he was speaking spiritually and he just continued to speak spiritually my father sent this this bread from heaven and this bread is not the bread that your fathers ate in the wilderness and are now dead and I don't think they even really understood what he meant by that that Dead We Know by our Prophet for our day said that meant Eternal separation from God because they did not believe they didn't have faith in their hearts to mix with the word when it was brought to them through the prophet for their day brothers and sisters I pray that we will have faith to mix with the word that's brought To Us by the prophet in our day because he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if we don't have faith in our hearts to mix with that word then we will find ourselves the same as those people in the wilderness Jesus God Jehovah Elohim he finally got fed up with them murmuring in the wilderness and he finally said to them because of your unbelief your carcasses are going to fall in the wilderness and you will not see the Promised Land because of your murmuring continually murmuring sign Wonder sign Wonder your shoes haven't worn out your clothes haven't worn out you haven't been sick you've been fed you've been given water every single need that you've ever had you've been given ah and you still murmur still murmur how far down the road are we today a couple have said it in here help us Lord we certainly don't want to be murmuring but to look at this word tonight I want to take it just a little step further uh Brothers I just ask I don't know if the furnace is off it's awfully hot can we turn the fans on if it's not cooling maybe even just like the ceiling fans I'm sorry to interrupt what I wanted to do tonight was take this and and bring it into our day and talk about this bread of life in our day you know when we look at the message of the hour when we hear the word spoken by the prophet we're not hearing the words of a man we're hearing the words of almighty God that's why God raises up a prophet so that he can use the voice of that surrendered vessel to speak Words of Life unto us to send us that bread from heaven and we have the opportunity to accept that word or reject that word now imagine if we're given that word from Heaven we're given that loaf of bread from Heaven just to make it just a simple illustration here if we take that loaf of bread and we have to eat that loaf of bread that's what's going to sustain us but we say no I don't think I like to eat the crusts I don't like the crust I'm going to cut the crust off but the crust has a lot of nutrients in it that we need but and that's why it's a part of the loaf but if we take and alter it and say I'm just going to cut the crusts off and eat it without that are we getting the full sustenance from that loaf of bread it becomes altered at that point and potentially we miss some of that that that nutrient that we need to sustain us same thing with the message of the hour brothers and sisters but in some cases it seems like we can keep the word of God not a problem and honor the word of God not a problem but we can take the message of the hour and we can dissect it and take the parts that fit us and actually set aside the parts we don't like we can say that maybe our parents were burned by a Ministry somewhere along the way and it's just okay for me to now retract back and act a certain way because of what I've seen God's not going to say to us were your parents offended he's going to say the same thing that he said to his disciples does that offend you does it offend you does the word of God through the prophet for your day offend you we need to make sure that we've got faith in our hearts to mix with that word for our day and you know what happens brothers and sisters as we have faith in our hearts to mix with that word for our day the only thing that we do is just say Amen we just say Amen there's something in us that just says amen and what it does is it fertilizes that word that seed that's in our heart that's in our soul and it starts to grow in our lives the exact same way that it did with Mary I just keep going back to it but I can't get away from it to think that Mary the only thing she had to do was say be it unto me according to Thy word the only thing she had to do was believe as we read this morning out of Jehovah Jireh 1964. brother Branham talking about this very scripture here he says now we find one time Jesus speaking just like watch one little quotation here I'd like to make Jesus has a great crowd around him and it looked like there was too many so watch what he said he had to shake him down a little bit he had to see who's who he had to do a little sifting and how does he do it by the word speaks the word Jesus had a great crowd around him and it looked like there was too many so watch what he said except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life now what do you think that a medical doctor or any intellectual person would think when they heard of a man that had a name of being an illegitimate child and more like a renegade to the people of that day some guy that just came on the scene that didn't come on the scene the way that it should come the way that everyone thought that he should come the scholarly way the polished way the eloquent way born in a stable nursed in a rock in a Manger we've gone through all of that brother brother Ken really went through all of that at one point but so he says more like a renegade to the people of that day to stand up and make a quotation like that except you eat my flesh and you drink my blood why they'd say that man's a vampire a human vampire why my drink a man's blood and eat his flesh you congregation get away from such a crazy man this is the part that I wanted to get to brothers and sisters because we're all familiar with that portion of it we're all familiar with what he said unless you eat my flesh and you drink my blood you have no part in me unless you're willing to come to the communion table you have no part in me you can see where I'm going with this tonight I just felt so inspired to talk about this communion is vital communion is not optional communion is a staple in the diet of a Christian it's one of the three ordinances that our Prophet gave us communion table foot washing and water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's amazing when you look at it how those three things are together if you look at it that way we could say that you know the the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes by by baptism of water correct water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins that you should be saved right but yet those other two are a part of of the three that brother Branham brought for the church how important are those other two the one of them is coming and eating is flesh and drinking his blood and we'll read that in second Corinthians tonight but one of them is just following the scripture here and this was really early on in his ministry unless you eat my flesh and you drink my blood you have no part in me there was a bunch of make-believers hanging out in the church and what he had to do was shake them down they were getting in the way of the word so he had to do a little bit of a thinning in the crowd but this is the part I wanted to get to tonight brothers and sisters but the Branham goes on to say this he never explained it he never explained it he says it twice he never explained it he didn't have to explain it that's right he just wanted to see what kind of Faith they had see he goes on to say you if you believe you'd believe I don't care what anybody said my if I prayed for 5 000 people tonight and all five thousand died tonight in the morning I'd still be praying for the sick see it's What God Says is what counts it ain't what people does see it's not what people does and God he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you my that people that intellectual group why they said get away from that man he's mad he's a wild man while he's a human vampire eat that man's body now he never explained it I just find that fascinating he just never even explained that all he did was Shake him down and you know the people who truly believed they said wow this is maybe getting a little nuts now some of my friends have actually left some of the people that I witnessed to to get into the church to come and follow the Messiah they they've left and now I have a choice to look like a bit of a fanatic and stay with them or to actually carry on and they made their choice they made the choice to carry on and you know some might say well they couldn't have made a choice but they did they had free will but they were predestinated to follow him even the son of perdition the twelve followed them well the 70 they took off they said this is just crazy we can't we can't do this no way why would we do that he wouldn't explain it to us we couldn't reason it away so we gotta go it's not about intellectualism we cannot explain it we have to believe it he goes on to say now he had 70 ordained preachers with him he thought he had a little too much crowd there so the crowd walked away from him so he had the ordained minister setting there he'd sent them out 70 of them he said what will you say when you see the son of man ascending up into heaven from whence he came prophesying of Acts chapter 1. knowing that that was exactly what's going to happen that he will Ascend right up to where he came from that he'll be received up into a cloud and that there would be two men standing there in white apparel saying to him ye men of Galilee why are you standing here looking around trying to reason this away he did exactly what he said he would back there with the 70. exactly what he said go on preach the gospel don't try and explain it just believe it now he never explained it them preachers said this man is sending up into heaven from whence he came why we know him we know his mother we've been to the stable where he was born we've seen the Cradle he was rocked in we fished with him looking at the carnal not understanding the spiritual and you know maybe we can't understand it and that's the beautiful part brothers and sisters that's the thing that I rejoice in because I I believe I'm not a very smart man but I do believe he's given me the ability to believe it and that's all we need brothers and sisters we don't have to understand it we don't have to be able to quote it up and down and and know all of the Nostalgia and the trivia about it we've got to believe it and you know what I'll just say it boldly talk is cheap if we're willing to live our lives according to the word that demonstrates the message that we believe I so appreciate what brother Emmanuel said last week our testimony is our message and we live our testimony every single day of Our Lives that just spoke to me because you know I can talk about your testimony and and you can talk about my testimony but will never have the same conviction that we'll have about telling our own testimony because we know what happened and you know when something happens in our own lives nobody can explain it like we can explain it nobody believes it like we believe it and you know when we get that experience that new birth that we talked about this morning when that happens in our lives we talk about it we show it our lives display it you cannot actually be converted and be the same person it's not possible you become a new creature in Christ Jesus is what the word says but here we have these people saying the same thing that they said in in verse 42 and they said is is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith I came down from heaven brother Bradham says we've been to the stable this is what the people were saying we've been to the stable where he was born we've seen the Cradle he was rocked in we fished with him we're laying out here on the banks with him and this son of man Ascend up from whence he come he come from Bethlehem where's this coming up that's too much for us and they walked away from him and he never explained it brother branham's words he never explained it he didn't have to explain anything God don't have to explain nothing he says he is God he just does it because he promised it and he don't explain it alls we've got to do brothers and sisters is believe it we've got to be willing to take him at his word to eat his flesh and to drink his blood and you know some people it's too much some people have reservations they can't do it or they won't do it some people won't do communion foot washing but I I don't know I just would say why on Earth would we claim to believe if we don't follow the word if we don't follow the instructions to the word but it's no different than saying that I believe and not coming to church not having a home Church there's all these different things that we could get into and I don't want to tonight I just want to say this I am super humbled and thankful to be a part of a body of Believers that want to follow the word because you know it makes it easy to preach as I'm sure the brothers understand it's such an honor and a privilege to stand before the Justified bride of Jesus Christ to know that this is the group of people that he's called and you know brothers and sisters maybe he has more people in this city maybe he has no more people in the city it doesn't matter we're not into numbers we're not into quantity we're into quality we're into believing the word entirely when we do that anything is possible brothers and sisters I'm just gonna wrap it up there I don't want to keep us long tonight as I said I understand it can be real easy to make the services long and I really don't want to do that I I just want to give us time to get into the communion service so maybe we could change the order of the service now we could call the musicians if you could stand with me we'll turn over to actually First Corinthians it's not second I said second and that was completely wrong forgive me again I got a little excited I do that First Corinthians chapter 11. I think I said 12. my very familiar scripture verse start with verse 23. First Corinthians chapter 12. for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup this do ye as often as he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoe the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with this world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto
