thank you I tell you it's just an honor to come and stand before God's children it's such a been such a battle but the lord always have a servant and Witnesses somewhere is that right is that right God knows all things God is in charge of all things because all things are possible to them that believe but we come here in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we come to lift him up on high we come to give him the praise we come to give him the honor we come to give him the glory those that are on the invisible audience continue to p with us because we know we're in a battle but God said no weapons formed against us shall prosper is that right so this is the uh unexpected to the unexpected but all is well right God know where we're supposed to fall this morning our hearts and mind are clear let us pray Lord God we thank you for your grace your mercy we thank you Lord God for an opportunity Lord Jesus just to come before your precious children father I come here Lord God with a humble Heart Lord God depending on your Holy Spirit to come and minister to your precious children father those are Lord God struggling in the flesh father many are sick Lord God but we know Lord Jesus that you're Jehovah rapi so we come Lord God thanking you for those that pressed the way out Lord Jesus on this morning and those that had a desire to be here wherever they may be father send the word of Grace touch their bodies father touch their hearts touch their minds touch their souls Lord Jesus and father so many of them Lord God across the land father don't understand what's going on but father we are the witnesses Lord Jesus we know father that we're not going to leave here without a battle but we know Lord Jesus the victory is ours so we give you praise we give you honor we bring every Spirit under subjection that's here Lord God that's trying to trouble the hearts and the mind of your precious children we thank you in Jesus name we pray amen and amen amen we won't keep you standing then we won't if you turn to Luke Chapter 2 and we'll look around verse 25 Hallelujah you have it say amen he says in and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him you may be seated he says and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death he said before he had seen the Lord Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus us to do for him after the custom of the law he says then took he him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for my eyes have seen thy salvation may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you know we're going to look at a little thought that the prophet of God worked with numerous times uh we going let expectation you know expectations you know when you're dealing with expectation you know that uh you get what you come looking for right I mean that's just the way it is you pull on the word of the lord we drive the devil up out of here we finish him off is that right is that right because somebody coming looking maybe for salvation someone need Deliverance this morning some one need healing this morning if you come expecting that you will receive it is that right this is the only place you can come and you can receive what you come expecting is that right so we know we want to look at here and just read a quote here from the from the message and those that's writing it down you got to pray when we don't have a board here so uh I I'll read it here he says I like to use he said for a context here tonight uh this morning they building excuse me you see something unusual we usually have three classes of people that always attend the service right he says and like it was in the days of our Lord he says and all times there is a unbeliever make believer the believer it just attracts those attention always he said now but expectancy is that's a great thing brother random said that's a great thing you know now now don't let it be so simple and it go over your head when if he say it's something great then that mean whatever you can ask for you can receive is that right because expecting is a what it's a fulfillment of a promise is that right it's something you looking forward for it's something that you wait on but you know expecting but one thing you do know you're going to get it is that right we know that things is based upon naturally the first thing come at people when a situation happen is fear is that right that's the Cardinal mind that's the intellectual mind these things come and they try to attack you is because it's always Waring against the spirit man is that right so we want we want to finish reading this here and then we'll look at some saints one of our our Believers in the scriptures here and you can see it he says now expect it says now but expectancy that's a great thing to expect something you usually get what you expect you see you usually get it he says some he says some people come to the meetings and well I didn't expect to get anything out of it well they won't because those who expect to get something God will give them their expectations if they're doing it reverently and in the fear of God now you have to understand the reason why some of you not getting it is because you're not meeting God's conditions and see once you meet God's conditions it's yours is that right and once it's all it's all yours Saints but you have to meet God's conditions is that right so first of all you can tell if you're meeting God's condition if some of you come late every time the doors is open every time the doors is open you're late you can't convince me you're expecting to get what you're looking for that's it Brother come on the prophet of God said you come early and come reverently you see your War we said last time we were here we were talking about this is the storehouse is that right you are God's Storehouse and which is him so who God so we expecting and we expecting so we know God's going to meet us here is that right we're coming before a great king uh a great God uh a mighty God uh you see so he's the Alpha and Omega is that right the first and the last so when we come we know we going to receive what we come expecting for is that right so we have to make set up on our heart and mind to do what to be here in our positions when we supposed to be here okay you'll find out though to be what you to get what that you expecting you have to stick with the word of God is that right and the word of God came from the mouth of a prophet of God is that right and when he comes and he gives us instructions because we see you know there's no way the enemy should be attacking us like this we're going to show it in there no this is the army of God uh we're the people of God uh is that right we going to teach you God has taught us how to fight these battles is that right the battle is not ours it's the Lords is that right no weapons formed against us shall prosper is that right what you bind on Earth shall be bind in heaven what you loose on Earth shall be loose in heaven is that right he gave us promises many promises so we're expecting for those promises to be fulfilled when the enemy arise is that right that's when now the we supposed to apply what God is teaching teaching us you come reverent you come prayed up you got to realize it you're not sit under any any type of ministry I'm going ask you something did not the scripture said that Paul set up what his father put him up under one of the greatest teachers right that's right in the land at the time chameleon didn't have what we have huh we going to put our God up here for now and on that's our [Applause] God you see so you know when the enemy we don't need no discrepancy you see we don't need any Discord okay because we supposed to be what standing and praying for the ministry is that right you praying for the ministry day and night without season is that right every time the head comes to you every time the head comes to your remembrance every time that office come to your remembrance you say a prayer right there is that right we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places we're talking about expectations when you're in your position here and you want to get reverence soon as the enemy the Holy Spirit showed us Wednesday he ministered us Wednesday and the pastor and I knew exactly where he was going and what the enemy was doing God came in here and exposed the enemy is that right because we're not talking about people we're brothers we're sisters we're family we love when you hurt I hurt okay when you get blessed I Rejoice is that right I thank God for you you know what it is for a man to get a house for his family I Rejoice with that brother he getting a house God got him that house he didn't take any Glory he gave it to God is that right he gave him the praise he gave him the honor but God gave it to him at the right time is that right God is in control nothing's out of control we coming in expectation Saints and he said because we represent you got the greatest representation on Earth you're a Christian there's nothing can be greater than a Christian Saints is that right Christlike let me finish reading I don't know which way it might go this this when the Lord called me he already knew so Lord he just a servant you have your way he said look he said now and we're at uh 3861 in case paragraph 71 he says now always to find out something first is to find out whether it's God's will now this is what the prophet is telling us first you got to know if it's God's will you see and now he said and help me Lord whether it's God's will or not and then if it's the will of God I'll try to say slow brother Mickey he says he says and and if it's and if it's the will of God then you're objective to it okay let's look at Matthew uh let's look at Matthew 6 Matthew 6 here get a little F first we got to know if it's the will of God the Holy Spirit has been working with prayer and now that prayer has been open to us where it's not just no longer a simple prayer that's right it's not a this we know it's the disciples prayers not the Lord's Prayers that right John 17 over there is is The Lord's Prayer he said look over here he says after this man verse n Matthew 6 and9 after this man remember they asked Jesus to teach him to pray and he says Our Father which are in heaven he said what Hallowed be thy name he said thy kingdom come so that thy what so that the will can be done so for you to know for the will for to be done you have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that lead and guide you in the directions and he will let you always know that God's will for you is that right remember we read Simeon he says Simeon was in Anointed with the Holy Ghost is that right the spirit of God was on Simeon so that's why we say the footsteps of the righteous they're ordered of who they're ordered of the Lord uh so we come in there and and and let me keep going here he says now thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is where at in heaven so we know the first thing for you to be able to know the will of God I father we worship him we praise him and the only way to get in touch with him from Earth to Heaven it's prayer amen yeah that's why I didn't get too many amens cuz you need to start praying more uhoh Lord Lord we going to get somewhere in a minute huh huh building up your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost you see there's no way the enemy should be in here like this with this kind of sickness okay he should be getting up feeling getting to his job coming in here laboring in the word of God for us because uh we all benefit from that Ministry so you recognize that we when the Lord now is not just telling us he's giving us a weapon the prophet of God said that's one of the greatest weapons you can have is prayer and we don't use it as much as we should you can use it in the shower you can use it in the table you can use it in the bedroom you can use it outside uh you can use it when you're driving you know you got some of them in some of the religion telling them just to pray three times a day a certain time of the day is that right oh look at the grace that we got uh 24hour access uh we can pray without ceasing is that right we're talking about our God our Father Saints huh Our Father which are in heaven huh let me keep going just letting them have his way I got no use for the devil okay if something pinch you then that mean you need to get out of that Cardinal mind you see quit your quit your thinking like men is that right huh he said now look he said look he said now he said give us he he said give us this day our what Daily Bread so now we realize by the teaching of of the Holy Spirit through the ministry that's here you don't have to worry about your daily bread is that right God is obligated to give you your daily bread is that right well how many of you do you hear a bird getting up complaining a bird will wake up singing early in the morning praising the Lord uh you know why because God is obligated to get him that worm uh God is obligated to get him that bird food uh he know God is obligated to take care of him is that right he said take no thought what for what you should eat or wear or think is that right he said is not the body the soul more important than the rment and food is that right so God's promise he letting you know he's going to take care of us he has to take care of us he has to keep his word is that right so we're talking about now expectation each time so you know that if God said he going to give us our daily bread H you should wake up smiling everything today because God is obligated to gr us our daily bread huh Hallelujah he said now look he said give us this day our daily bread and do what forgive our debtors as we forgive uh our debtors and let me say it again and forgive us our debt as we forgive our who that us now when you get there one of the problems is brother brandom said also you got those two elements that you're facing always is fear and faith now fear the element is accompany with doubt is that right it's trying to get you to come in in doubt uh but you want to look at this he also said faith is based upon forgiveness what he said he's telling you now when you start talking about forgiveness he's talking about people are worrying about people coming to them and saying that they sorry and things in that nature look at that scripture again we go to our father first I said forgive me Lord uh why because we've already forgive the deiters is that right we forgave them already we're a different spee we're a different seed uh now you're talking about forgiveness uh that's why some of you can't break through you got things in your heart that you got to forgive people for and God's going to let you break through yes sir come on Lord you're sitting there and when you're down in there and you and and you know that perhaps somebody you know they did you wrong huh you know things that that that happen but we are supposed to do a forgive them is that right that's a powerful thing in prayer is forgiveness when God come in there and he talk about each and every one of us now we going to God when they let's look at this scripture first I want you to I don't want to rush past this point you go over here now he says God help me let's look over to Luke I think it's Luke 11 God help me he says let's look at it again he said and it came to pass let's start at 11 11 and one chapter 11 verse one it came to pass that that he was praying in a certain place when he sees one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples he says and he say unto them when we pray say Our Father which are in heaven he says Hallowed be thy name he said thy what kingdom come he says thy will be done as it is in earth as so in Earth give us day by day our daily bread now the Holy Spirit you know he's been working that real strong with us because he's bringing us to a point he's equipping us from the storehouse because we going to need these Goods down the road is that right we're going to be able you're the one that going to be able to stand in the Gap and stand there and pray is that right he says now you pray without ceasing remember the widow woman when she kept aggravating the unjust judge what did she do she contined to pray she continued to pray she continu to press him she continu to press him because she knew about what the Holy Spirit showed us what the mystery of asking is that right if my word abiding you and you abide in me whatever you ask you you can receive is that right we're talking about be meeting your expectations you're only not getting your expectations because there's things in your life that you know you're not doing huh and it got to start doing it this is not 2023 it's 2024 so the holy spirit is not sitting still is that right we're going to get somewhere in in a minute he said that now and forgive us our what sins for we also what forgive everyone that is in what forgiveness is a powerful thing yes it it's simple we look over thing it's a powerful thing because in the Old Testament the only one could had the who who had the the authority to forgive somebody was God the Holy Spirit you need to go back and say and look at that message making the Holy Spirit straight let's get it straight I think he titled it the Holy Spirit what it really is he said Let's Straighten It Out is that right and he was showing him in every showed us in every age that they saw them different Ezekiel saw him the will in the middle of the will Daniel saw the light and the Lions then is that right and so so we have to understand we going to see him as the what as the word of God is that right the theophany the word bride that's how we going to see them so we have to understand in this hour here now with these little simple messages it sound simple but they're powerful because you got to understand how they looked at Jesus when he started talking about forgiving look at this here Lord help me let me finish reading he says our sins for we also forgive everyone that is in debt to us and lead us not into what but Deliver Us from what so what was stopping you from the Temptation was your forgiveness right that's the next thing is that right yes sir so you have to understand why God is instructing us and telling us to do these things is that right he he say look turn over before I go for God help me turn over to uh I think it was uh Romans I one Romans God help me it was uh I'm looking forward the other where they asked Jesus to um um uh um when the man had the puses and he healed them was that Matthew no it was it Matthew 11 God help me I think I wrote it down wrong Hallelujah help me Lord here we go Lord help me anyway he says when the man came to him um I mean when they brought him Jesus and they was pressing for the word here'll bring it to me and they was pressing to the word and when they was pressing to hear the word there was no way for him to get in they had to cut a hole in the roof and lay them down that's right that's right and when they saw that faith it was their faith it was their faith it wasn't the one that was laying on the cck faith it was their faith it was their faith it was their faith it was their faith it's your faith that's going to save your father it's your faith that's going to save your mother it's your faith that's going to save your son it's your faith that's going to save your daughter it's your faith that's going to save your child it's going to be your faith is that right because you can stand in the Gap form because God has given us the power of forgiveness that's right amen I'mma find that scripture what do they say what did they say to Jesus they asked them who did the thank you brother let's turn to mark 2 I want you to see this Hallelujah Mark 2 let me see where we at there where the sabath I think it was 23 I think it might have been was it there it is thank you yes sir and again he entered into capern after some days and it was noise that's Mark 2:1 and straightway many were gathered togethering so much that there was no room to receive them not so much uh as about the door and he preached the what the word unto them what were they pressing for the word they was coming to the for the word uh he said now he said he said they pressed away in and they come to him he said bringing one sick of the PES which was born a four he says and when and when they could not come nigh unto him for the Press they uncovered the roof he said see where he was and when had broken it up he says they let down the bed wherein the sick of the py laid he said when Jesus saw their faith see their faith you see he said unto the sick of the py son thy thy sins be what forgiven thee he says but there were certain of the scribes their reasoning in their hearts is that right that's why I said the Holy Spirit already know if you a non-believer if you're a makeb Believer if you a skepticism you are not going to dodge the Holy Ghost in This age here you might as well forget about it is that right that's why the holy spirit says the unrighteous cannot sit in the seat with the scorners cannot sit in the seat with the righteous sooner or later God is going to have his way let me keep going he says now he in verse uh uh seven why doeth this man thus speak blasphemian who can give who can forgive sins but who now you see the authority that God has given us in this age you see what he's giving us that's why when I say you go back to message and he was telling them he drove on their body spirit and it drew soul and he said down in there he put seed he said in the message making what is the Holy Ghost making it straight uh and then he said down he did what it was God out there right and the seed down there is the word of God which is God speaking to God is that right it's God speaking to God so now you're origin of God you come from God you belong to God you're the same species of God you have the same Authority as God uh you have to understand now what you buying on Earth you shall be bind in heaven any sickness any kind of diseases you supposed to know now how to fight it off is that right because when you come in there we're still in this flesh uh we still going to have things is that right so you got to understand in certain ways to battle this flesh is that right so God is telling you how to meet the conditions in there so if you see something getting on your flesh you got to constantly drink something warm is that right keep drinking something warm keep drinking something warm normally it's tea to keep the bacteria off of your mouth and when you get in there I'm going tell you about I'm ready to hit the dentist office now is that right you notice you notice you got to have water right you notice they don't give you no more mouthwash right I won't say why I leave it alone now but but you got to take the Water Rinse your mouth and you spit it out is that right but you got to have a way to know how to fight this old flesh is that right because you got body you got spirit and you got soul is that right the body we know is the five elements that allow us to operate here on Earth is that right so we know in the spiritual realm that's free more will everybody's on free more will is that right the Lord even Cain even know how to get that benefit didn't he because he went in ask wasn't he that benefit it was under the what the law is that right it was too it was too severe for him so he knew the law and he asked God is that right and God also showed us now we going to tell me uh if a de if a demon get inside of some pigs uh and they go to Jesus and ask Jesus to get him out of there and we're the seed of God I don't have to take nothing he gave me the right to cast it down is that right destroy it speak the word huh brother gra speak the word and stand on it and walk in it this is our God you're got a big God huh what's too hard for our God huh nothing too hard for our God I'm claiming nothing I don't have to claim it is that right God told me I got right to destroy but it all got to be mixed with what faith is that right down in that seed uh you got that spiritual realm is that right imagination that's how he in it in imagination he got Eve through reasoning right affection is that right oh them old demons love to get you out there through through deception and affection is that right affection huh come on man it is Lord huh you're going to tell me when they get around in there with this foolishness huh putting them filthy garments on let me tell you something turn to Romans 12 huh you might as well you you know what I tell you I don't want you know I don't want you to uh uh uh uh leave or anything like that you come as you are is that right you come as you are God said come as you are but if you want to get in a position somewhere you're going to have to look for the deacons is that right is that right because we sure we'll address we can't stop it is that right it's for your welfare let going tell you why Romans 12 help me Lord uh we're talking about letting this foolishness pull you in the world is that right see what God say your servant is he said Romans 12 And1 I besee you therefore Brethren by the what the mercies of God never forget the mercies of God you can always get the mercies of God is that right God's grace and we saved by grace through faith he said now that ye present your what body a what Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God you know what the Propet of God said he said this is your what is unreasonable he said you know that's unreasonable when you wearing garments that show in your body you know that's unreasonable to wear them high heels that have your rear in like a bowl of jelly you know that is is not right huh huh you know old folks old folks used to tell us they make it look bad make sin sin is bad yes sir huh you know it's unreasonable for you to look them around out there looking at them um sisters out there in the world and you thinking those things are reasonable no Paul said they're unreasonable for you been snipping your hair or wearing hairstyles that's out there is unreasonable do you know it's a 25% increase in skin care you better be careful it's a thin line with makeup and skin care you know some of this stuff is unreasonable huh God is not playing with it you got to understand SPS huh he said I'll have you not ignorant to Satan devices is that right God said it we didn't say it we're just a vessel that's being used he's the I'm the he's the Potter I'm just the clay is that right yielding yourself to the word of God so God's children can be what without the church without a spot or a blemish or without such uh we may not look to be nothing but sooner or later before we leave here we going to be just like him we going to have the same character we going to walk like our father we're going to talk like our father we're going to speak like our father you going to talking about in here huh this is the message of the hour huh help me Lord look what he says present yourself as a Living Sacrifice and then what holy huh acceptable unto who now you know good and well if you can't do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't do it that's right Pastor don't do it if you got a doubt or you got a question don't do it is that right I you think I'm just talking about them sisters and you me walk around here with these tight garments on is that right in here you just as bad as they are because you can cause one of these sisters your sister did not the Lord teach us in ecclesiastic over there that that sister is your sister she may become your wife one day is that right come on Brothers we're talking about Bible right now God is bringing we're written Episcopal read upon all men is that right that's what God Said present yourself as a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God is that right when I was a child I spake like a child I did childish things is that right huh you walking around and with the craftiness we're going to we God going she showed me something else I'm going read to you why when we getting in them in there them old demons running around here thinking you're slick you ain't slick let me tell you something y'all got to forgive me y'all have to forgive me that's why that's how I tell the inmates I talk to the inmates try to be slick you know what I mean you trying to get around there and be crafty man we know the Holy Ghost know what you doing is that right he just longsuffering he tender heart he's merciful is that right you see these things let me keep going help me he said he said what be ex be holy unto who God which is your what reasonable service is that right he says and be ye not conformed to this what who's saying that the pastor brother Kelly sir huh brother Seth sir brother po sir huh the word can't offend the [Applause] [Music] word hello huh oh all is going to do is make you closer I think the brother Robert sang a song here right when Jesus is looking for what Jesus is looking in all of us Jesus want to see Jesus is that right that's what we want to see in each and every one of us let me keep it going help me Lord he said now look he says be not conformed to this world but be ye what by the what knowing of your mind and see that's your spirit there your mind and your spirit that ye may what prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect what so we're still talking about the point that the prophet of God quoted first you got to know if it's the will of God so you got to understand you dressing properly you coming early being prayed up you praying reading your Bible because becoming a holy Child of God that's the will of God uh that's your reasonable service to God uh that's who it is for is that right Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name uh thy what kingom so that thy will be done so Simeon knew the will of God because the Holy Ghost revealed it to him the Bible say the Holy Ghost was upon him is that right he don't care how crazy they thought he was at 80 years old saying that he was going to see the Christ uh is that right perfect will of God let's turn back to Matthew 6 we're not forgetting we not finished with the forgive uh yet huh look what he say look how many times Jesus pointed it out oh man if this under me man need to come around here and apologize to me man they know he did that oh man that sister get around there get around there this mean you know she need to apologize to me show me where you said to that now you go to the father First Once you made right for the father made things right with the father you're able to stand I know many people went on to be with the Lord and they they forgave the person that did something to them go Hallelujah let me see look what he says we in chapter 6 we're back over to verse 12 he says and give us and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen look what he said in 14 again he said amen Pastor he said for if ye forgive what men of their what your heavenly father will also what look at 15 but if you forgive what not men he said their trespasses neither will your father what that's why your prayers ain't being answered need to get that thing out of your heart man need to get it out of your heart this day you will be delivered is that right this day you will be delivered is that right you will get anything that's there now we saying father forgive us for holding that thing that long father I want to move on with you is that right now Lord God uh when I could go to the father I could go to him with confidence now is that right because nothing condemn me is that right when you lay down there remember the prophet of God when he got down in there he was nervous he had a lot of pressure on him people can be have a lot of pressure that's why he said we have to understand people you have to forgive them some people in certain positions got a lot of pressure on them but the prophet had a lot of pressure on them at the time especially when somebody charging you with 300 and some thousand back in that day that's a lot of money he says and and then you're innocent also that's a rough thing that's like being locked up and you're innocent so when you get around and then he had to do what he had a lot of pressure on him is that right and when he went there and he told a lie ran outside told his wife what did he tell his wife he told his wife what that tell tell them I ain't here is that right tell them I ain't here so when he got over there he said oh bill you know you should I wasn't here soon as he went to pray for that baby is that right huh soon as he went to pray for that baby and then what then come the devil right because the devil got right to is that right he got right to come there until he had to say Lord forgive me and as that man to forgive me and what did the lawyer said bill I respect you more than I ever did now than I ever did before you do things what's right Saints and I'm telling you forgiveness is a powerful thing uh it's a thing that it's a weapon that God has given us to do what everybody can't go out and do what I do what brother Steve do brother Seth or or or brother polycar no you call for something different but one thing we can do we can get people saved through prayer is that right we get them saved through prayer you can stand in the gap for him is that right so we have to understand what the Lord is bringing to us in this hour here now we got so much Authority that's why the prophet of God said all that power that we have in prayer that's all this is this is what this is prayer is that right knowing the will of God tell you look let's keep going he says but verse 15 he says but if but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses verse 16 he said more moreover when you fast be not as the Hypocrites of a sad countenance let me jump a little bit in verse 17 but thou when thou fastest anoint thy head and was thy face he said now he said thou that thou appear not unto men to fast but un to thy father which is in what secret that's what we were saying remember part of the storehouse we were talking about the last time we was here it was your closet when you praying privately you could pray different when you privately is that right you could call out names uh you can bind those demon forces up uh you can sing something that your brother or your sister is struggling with uh you can pray for him you can stand in the Gap with them now you got a Clear Channel where you could go and stand in the Gat with him why is because what because you have forgiveness is that right you said father forgive you forgave them so we have to move on Saints into what God is moving us into he says now look he says and then what God not going to leave you just in in the dark he says and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee what that's right right Pastor openly is that right he show you he'll testify he'll bring a testimony to show that your prayers have been answered is that right he heard you go back to the I'm going back to the quote 31861 look goes what he says paragraph 71 now always to find out something first is to find whether it's the will of God or not he says that then then if it's the will of God then then you're your objective to it amen and then your motive in doing it it's the will of God and your objective is right and your motive is right it got to happen let us s in I'm telling you somebody's getting delivered from forgiveness today you see it's just that simple depend so once now God will show you if your motive and if your objective is to do the will so God can get Glory so God can get the Praises so God can get the honor we come to worship him to lift him up up he's obligated to give it to you is that right you're going to get it that's right brother always always that's why you think the pastor why you think so many demon forces is coming out you got to be spiritual sometime come on we ain't claiming to be no holier than now all of us got the holy ghost that got the Holy Ghost all of us can discern what's right and what's wrong don't let nobody fool you you say grieve not the holy spirit of God which by you are what sealed until the day of your Redemption is that right once you now you're a new creature in Christ Jesus and all old things have passed away there's no condemnation who those that are in Christ Jesus we walk not after the flesh but we walk after after the spirit fear can't do nothing us because we walk not after the flesh is that right so you got to understand right now what God is bringing us into right now that spiritual walk is that right so you got to understand once you discern and certain things you got to realize these demon forces is attacking them that's it brother you think this is something like what we're getting no sir no sir we're not wrestling against we're not against the Catholic Baptist Methodist Lutheran Presbyterian Pentecostals no I get over here because why God might anoint me to say certain things I've seen them religious demons for years is that right you going to tell me we can't recognize with something that's proper and is not proper come on did not Moses mother recognized Moses was a proper child you mean I can tell you you the Bride of Jesus Christ you the Bride of Jesus Christ sitting up under this word is that right G not the holy spirit of God I fear no devil is that right let it come up in there I got the authority of God God's giving me the authority huh stop letting the devil make you think you sin there's no way you can sin he said it turn to First John 3 3 first John 5 we're going to bust we're going to bust this lion demon up to make you think you sinning this ministry this ministry is just shaking up this ministry is shaking up these religious demons in this [Applause] [Music] message I ain't looking for your money cuz God take care of me I don't want your women cuz I got a beautiful wife uh a virtuous woman and I ain't looking for no position is that right cuz I've been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ huh huh we've been well trained uh huh we've been well trained uh taught by the Holy Ghost uh being led by the Vindicated Prophet is that right or the messenger of the hour we cannot lose with what we got onuh so don't want you to say don't want you to say we you marrying Brandon hello huh you can't tell man and the prophet of God told us Satan to try to get you three ways one he get you off the word he'll try to exploit your gift and then he'll try to put you in a position is that right religious demons is that right coming around in there I can tell you the reason why he say if you go over to Isaiah 8 Isaiah 8 and I think it's 12 it talks about those those devils and why they can't see the light the reason why they can't see the light because they're not taking the message of the hour and not fully believing all of the message of the hour and the message of the hour is Christ and the Holy Ghost for back on the scene again is that right did not God show it to us did not God vindicate it to us this young man sitting on the four throw he's down in there with glasses he turned his back to him is that right who who's the only one can discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart it was a Vindication that when the same sign came to Abraham and the wife up there to the tent uh and he spoke to him and said uh how Abraham why the Sarah Al is that right don't you know the same God is here you get that fullness out of your heart before God start calling these things out on you yes sir yes sir not in this church it won't happen huh God's not putting up with nothing with the Devil is that right everything shall rest store is that right we're in expectation because the Bible said what the pmer worm cankerworm the calip have eaten I will restore we was in we were in expectation of that is that right and do no sin turn to First John 3 and 5 Hallelujah I love whipping on the devil that's right huh that's right I love you Saints I love but I can't stand the devil I got no use for him he because he come to kill steal and destroy it has nothing it has nothing it has nothing to do with him he's the vessel God put that seed there before the foundation of the world the way he move and operate that's a gift that God put inside of him yes sir you can't glorify God when you recognize something come from God then not the Bible said every good gift comes from above look what he says First John 3 I'm sorry 1 John 3 1 John 3 and verse 4 First John 3 verse4 he saids whosoever commit sin transgressed also the what the law for sin is the transgression of the law what the Lord give us a revelation of we know sin is just unbelief right that's all it is okay he get around he say ye know that he was what manifested to take away our what and in him is no what and you are in [Applause] him huh amen am he said whosoever abideth in him what sinth not whosoever sinth have not what seen him neither known him little children let no man what that's why when the pastor sent out that that that that that that quote there guard your heart man it's the most wickeded part of the body that's why God has to come and destroy this earth now why because the man imagination is continuously that's right brother continuously evil in his heart is that right you know the prophet of God said in one of those quotes he said he said the purpose the everything they do is evil their purpose what their purpose is is for Destruction and you can see the characteristic of the devil kill steal and destroy it's all down in that that let me keep going he said now look he said little children he that doeth righteousness is what righteous and even as he is what so you're doing the righteousness because you're in Christ it's the righteousness of Christ is that right let me keep going he said look at verse eight he says he that committeth sin is of what for the devil sinth from the what for for this purpose the Son of God was what that he might do what ah you think we're going to stop preaching against that foolishness try to come through this door come on we can't we can't is that right you got to keep calling it out every time every time you see the devil a little 11 11 a whole lump is that right is that right if you come in here and you're doing something just go pray Lord help me get this disobedient Spirit off of me father I need help Lord uh I need more of your spirit Lord uh Lord God uh I want to do your will I want to be transformed like you father I don't want to be conformed to the thoughts and things of this world father I need your help Lord you said Lord God if your word abide in me and I abide in you whatever you ask I can receive Lord Jesus so now when you come up uh you got the spirit of of grudges offer you when you get up there holding grudges when you get up now you can have confidence that what that that Spirit done left you is that right now you can move forward let me keep going look what he says he says now it's of the devil it says whoo is born of God do what do not commit sin for his what ah Body Spirit Soul down in there is what ah huh for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of who now you born of God so you say brother Glenn we can't s to what you do you make [Applause] mistakes you just make mistakes that's all you repent for it and you move on that's all man yes sir you move on can you imagine a man sitting in the institution and you told him if you can get him to Christ if we can get him to Christ then then you can get him to see into the word because you got to extend you give him understanding to born again that you're being born again that mean you had to be in another place before you before we were born in sin shaped in iniquity comeing the world speaking lies we were down when God said let there be light and the light moved across the Earth that proves to all of us no matter what when God said something I believe it it's going to happen I'm expecting for it to happen because when he said let there be light and move the light gross darkness that was on the land is that right now we got the word we got the answer for the devil Isaiah 6 he said Rise and Shine for the light has come is that right h brother Robert he said why because the darkness but not only the darkness the gross darkness is on the people making them think wrong is Right making them think homosexuality they was born that way make you think you're transgender you could be changed uh is that right change your Sexes and things is that right making them think that it's all right is that right making them think pornography is all right if you struggling with pornography don't leave here we'll pray with you we'll pray with you amen yes your family man yes sir come on if you're getting around in there huh huh God didn't call out God didn't call that out for no reason at all neither huh you know that you got to realize these things is that right if you struggling with lust ask God to help you is that right he'll help you deliver you from those foolishness is that right huh he will let me keep going help me Lord he said now what Hallelujah where was we at was born of God born of sin turn to um tell you what turn to First Peter look at that seed once more can't sense man don't let the devil keep messing with your mind you just making mistakes can you get around in there Jesus Christ learned obedience by the things that he suffered that's all you see what I'm saying so so he get over there look around there we're talking about born again unless a man is born again he can't even enter into the kingdom of of God H them man born again you go out there now you got to tear down them religious demons because making people think that they born again and they wonder why they up and down they back and forth is that right them religious demons you got to tear them down he said root it up tear down and build them back up again is that right what he S I sent the Apostle Prophet Pastor teacher and evangelist for for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry the edify the edify the body of Jesus Christ that's it that's it look what he says he said look at verse verse 21 verse 21 first 1 Peter 1 verse 21 he says who by him do do believe in God that what raised him up from the dead and gave him what Glory that your Faith and Hope might be in what the resurrection that's what we're showing that Christ is not dead but he's Al liive is that right that's what we're preaching that's what our lives right cuz we're written they're watching our lives and they observing the way that we walk the way that you talk the way that you live is that right for the joy of the Lord is my strength is that right look what he says he says Sing verse 22 seeing ye have purified your what [Applause] uhoh Body Spirit Soul what locked down in the soul you got a what a seed is that right and the Holy Ghost protects that what that seed until we get out of here is that right let us keep going he said obeying the truth through the what the spirit see uniring love and Brethren see that ye love what with a what that's why he was saying they said brother bandam was wrong when they said that the Holy Ghost was love no no no no no no no go back and to that message that he gave the pastor on that message about the Holy Ghost and you see that Capstone what is it it's the word father the word and the spirit is one and love and the word and father is one because God is love it's a faith that's working by love husbands love your wives as Christ love the church uh is that right is no way that you can love your wife as Christ loved the church without the baptism of the Holy Ghost it got to be the spirit of God in your life it got to be there is that right he's the one that lead and guide us let me keep going Hallelujah he say now unfor love one another with a pure heart see fervently is that right we truly love you I love you my brother some people come up to you oh I love you my my brother how you doing brother come on cut out the hypocrisy [Music] [Applause] okay I'm like the

to understand you look them demons right in their eyes what do they got because I come in here what with the message of the hour and you're comeing there with the message of the hour they ain't heard nothing like this before is that right so they got to realize okay I I I know what what I'm up against when you dealing with them 95% of them belonger than there even the prophet of God said 95% of the crimes is by or over unsaved woman huh huh when they get there and they start laughing when I was telling about them bad women they got they start laughing I look at them just like this I'm not

me tell you something you know what I mean can't you see how much God loves you you ain't missing the beat bro only thing you missing is salvation and that's free too see how much he love you H I'm not boasting anything in in here I know what the Lord is bringing through here that's right I know what he's bringing through this store house is that right help me Lord he said now look in verse um verse 23 he said this would I wanted to get to being born again not of the what he said see that's why the prophet Prophet God preach them as seed of discrepancy he says but of The Incorruptible see by the what word of God which liveth and abideth for what so the seed is the what is the word of God so you're being born again by the word of God for the message of the hour is that right he said look what he says he said look what he says here he said now he said then your object then your objective paragraph 71 he said then your objective and then your motive in doing it if it's the will of God you are you are objective is and your objective is right and your motive is right it's got to happen he says there's just no way to to keep it from happening you see so you got to understand some of it you know deep down inside you're fighting a selfish motive is that right oh you think that ain't brother Glenn a Ain brother Glenn let's drop the 72 let's drop the paragraph 72 and then we going to see it and y'all viewers out there this for the home church but I love you he said now look he said so he he said so first find find the will see first Find the Will if it's God's Will and then what's your objective in doing it you see what I'm saying what is your objective in doing it he said he said now listen to this oh my been that long he said now look just give me a few more minutes he said now look he he said now he said now look he said God's will he said so 72 first Find the Will if it's God's Will and then what's your objective in doing it is if it's selfish you'll never get it done I don't care if you move along remember the Young Rich ruler uhhuh the Young Rich ruler he had religion he didn't have salvation we going to get back to Simeon but he had religion he didn't have salvation that's the problem where you're getting all of the demon forces be kicking back is because so many came up in the message huh he came up in the message when was a man so now God sent a what a word to restore everything back is that right he had to do it we was expecting Mal i 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 we was expecting the revelation of the seven Church ages we were expecting the revelation of the Seven Seals uh is that right so you have to realize the true word of God was expecting them they were crying out is that right because they knew that down in their soul the Bible said Paul only had part so it had to be a time when the fullness had to come is that right and so God has brought us in the hour and but he cannot just bring a word without the witnesses is that right ah oh God bless you Sister Roseberry brother Michael God bless you he said get around there right he said you got to you got to realize that he got to have a witness is that right on the scene here so it has to be someone that has to come and now unfold the Seven Seals and release those Thunders is that right it got to happen because the prophet of God said it was supposed to because that's the fullness of the scriptures is that right let me keep going and he also told us I will not have you in why h brother Mike we got to get a rapturing faith of Grace message it had to come to get us out of here you see what I'm saying so we not that's why Paul gave us a little bit of he said oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory glory be to God what death only pushed us closer to back to our dwelling place is that right we don't have no spirit of fear huh God did not give us us the spirit of fear but he gave us a spirit of Love Peace joy and a what and a sound mind is that right because we got the mind of Christ is that right he says think on these things what's pure what's holy what's just what's righteous what's honest you think on these things is that right Hallelujah is that right huh huh you hang in there sister Diamond you back home lady God bless you say look he says for now look he said for All Flesh is as grass and all glory as the flowers and the grass withered in the flower thereof and fth away but the word of the Lord endureth what forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you look what he said come me keep going and back to paragraph 72 he says it's if it's selfish you'll never get it done see some of you running around in there God always bring warning before judgment remember the Holy Spirit send a message and he said oh you have a south wind is that right it come easy right now is that right but things is mounting up is that right what they going to do what are they doing they getting you to going you're going to spend all that money you going to get it not they're going to force you to spin it if you ain't depending on the one who create who created everything is that right look what he said he created everything is that right everything of the seen and none of the Unseen what did he say there in the gospel of Gospel of John what did he tell him there in the beginning was the what he said the word and he said the word was with God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God he said the same was in the beginning with God he says and all things were made by what him and without him was not anything made that was what everything was made about him is that right huh let's look around and see what he say he says now he he says all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he says in him was what life and the life was the what he's looking for the life if you don't have the life there's no way the Holy Ghost is [Music] there he says in him he says all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended not he said there was a a man that what that sent from God whose name was who John did not they have such a light that was in uh brother Brandon they thought he was the one huh he says and that witness was a witness to Bear witness of the life he said that all men him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light he said verse n that that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world that's the True Light what's the pure that mean the pure only the pure unadulterated word could come back in this hour here and now so the light can be manifested that it should be manifested in there that's why he said you have the word it's not just the word word the prophet of God said now is the hour it's the manifestation of the spoken word is that right oh man we got so much here I tell you he said look at this here we're talking about expecting I'll say this here and I I I know better come to a close blind blind barbus remember when he was there and he was blind and he was there and he had he had a lamb and those Lambs he got there and he he used to and Dove turtle doves and then those turtle doves it's uh they would do tricks and they would do tricks and then he would get a little more money you know if he was there doing doing tricks and then he got there and I think his daughter got sick he was married probably God said he was married he had a daughter he said he got there and then they got there and after you can come on up musicians and he got there and he but and and and he had a uh his daughter got sick then his wife his wife got sick and all he had was a goat is that right and I mean a lamb that lamb and that lamb that he had he he he took a vow to sacrifice that lamb and he took a vow to sacrifice that lamb but we know he was expecting something amen but he sacrificed everything that he had that was dear to him right for someone else and when he got there and he said the priest said I'll get you that lamb I'll get you another lamb he said no I promise to give him this lamb and when he sacrificed and he gave him that land he got there and knew that the real Lamb of God was coming by and when the real Lamb of God came by he cried out he said have mercy upon me have mercy upon me Lord and he said God knew he knew the sacrifices him being God knowing all things and I'm just paraphrasing it God gave him his sight if you expecting something is based upon conditions I'm not saying what should be and shouldn't be but I know we get that forgiveness and pray more CU that's what pricked my heart more than anything there's no way he should be sitting there no way all this power we got all this standing in the Gap all this we should be doing we serve a supernatural God the things that the the the things that the Lord allow him to do they're Supernatural it's be done from the inner man it's the inner man that carries you so we have to understand where are family and I
