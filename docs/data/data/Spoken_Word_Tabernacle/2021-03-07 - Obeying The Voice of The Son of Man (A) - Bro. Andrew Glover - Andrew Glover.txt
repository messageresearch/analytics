walking down the road intoxicated at the time and a track trailer hit him but it didn't kill him and he got there so uh when he came through the door he had to get up on the stick and his right side was kind of rough and when he got in there and uh fellowship with him a little bit and then i said well come on let's pray so we got there and we prayed and and when we left the burial grounds and i rode past his trailer and he was walking around outside and i blew the horn and he said hey so i'm believing the lord going to do something for him but i'm just letting you know he answered my prayers
