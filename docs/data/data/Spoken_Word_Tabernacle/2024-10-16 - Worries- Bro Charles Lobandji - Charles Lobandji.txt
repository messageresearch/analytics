tonight I'm going to be a translator an interpreter amen so brother Charles he was here Pastor Charles he's a pastor back home two churches back home he Pastor two churches he was here I believe he was last Wednesday or or the couple weeks ago when brother Albert preached here so he will be ministering for us and I will be translating so let's hear from the word of God and see how the song blend with the sermon amen so sister rof you bring me higher and you manage him together let's go with only believe [Music] believe all things are [Music] people ho [Music] oh [Music] be be all things are [Music] POS only believe Lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] Lord I [Music] believe all things are are [Music] possible Lord [Music] I all things are [Music] possible [Music] Lord amen can you hear me okay praise God I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] may God bless each one of you and God bless the one who sang Here I believe it's a sister that sang here I was not sure but it's a sister God bless the sister who s here I'm still struggling with English but I was feeling Something in My Heart even though I don't hear English that something is going on with [Applause] this I wanted to even come in to see who [Music] is that was a masterpiece yes praise God I don't know he's a brother or sister God bless you may the Lord bless all the [Applause] musicians this is the way we should be worshiping and glorifying the Lord may God bless the pastor to whom I'm really expressing my gratitude he already introduced me and I heard him and recently I was with you and I preach here and he again extend his invitation to me by his love and hospitality and also the confidence because when someone give you the pulit this is beyond love so it's speaking about trust because you can love somebody but you don't trust them we love our enemies but we don't trust them you know the pulpit is like a bedroom so you don't put anyone inside the bedroom amen so your pastor love me so much God richly bless him let's go straight to business can you hear me okay until the Holy Spirit stay stop let's go to Philippian chapter 4 he asked me a question you want me to preach until when Philippians 4 Beginning by verse four last time time I preach like a teaching but tonight I'm bringing a little something but the word of God is never lead because one word out of the mouth of God it is more than a thousand word receive from samel Philippians 4 verse4 rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is a hand be careful for nothing but everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be known unto God and the peace of God which pass all understanding shall keep your hearts and Mind through Christ Jesus finally bre whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are h whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things that's why the recommendation brother Bram head from the angel is to tell us tell my people to keep the heart of your mind pure because your mind speak louder in heaven than your word amen Matthew let's go to Matthew chap 6 Matthew chapter 6 Matthew Matthew 6 I'm going to start by verse 25 until 34 [Music] therefore I say unto you take no thoughts for your life for what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than Remnant behold the foul of the air for they s not neither do they reap no gather into BS yet your heavenly father feed them are you not much better than they Hallelujah which of You by taking thoughts can add one cubit onto his stature and why do you take thought for remnant [Music] consider the LI of the field how they grow they to not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not array like one of these wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field [Music] which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he no much more clothe you oh ye of little faith amen therefore take no thoughts saying what shall we eat oh what shall we drink or where we shall we be clothed for for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take them no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought of the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof amen you might be seated let's go to Matthew 11 Matthew 11 25 and 26 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because th has he these things to the wise and The Prudent and Reve and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seems good in that sight let me finish my reading let's go to the Book of James James chapter 5 verse 7 and 8 be patient therefore brethen Brethren until the coming of the Lord behold the husband [Music] man the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for [Music] it until he receive the early and the latter rain so you also be patient my brother be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord Lord dth now let's pray heavenly father father we read the scripture you are the only one that can give us the context and that's what we are expecting and waiting that's why move me out of the way and speak to your people father father circumcise our ears and hearts so that each one of us may receive your thoughts in its all deepness so that leaving this building so that we can say that God have blessed me take the leadership of this meeting May the service of this word be from the beginning to the end in the name of Jesus Christ we humbly ask it amen amen again God bless you from uh the scripture we read I have a title based on the message that came with brother Bram and my title tonight is worries it's a little bit odd to have a title such as that one worries maybe you were expecting everything but not a title [Music] worries God is a god of [Applause] surprise amen amen amen am and looking into the scripture and in the message the word worry I went and asked the dictionary tell me about worries first of all the dictionary of man before getting into God's Own dictionary because the dictionary of God in this same time is William Mario [Applause] amen amen Amen brother Bram if you ask the dictionary to give you the word adultery they will give you a certain sense but when you get in God's Own dictionary it's speaking about something completely different that's why in this age we must bring what God's Own dictionary has already brought to [Applause] us in men's dictionary he say that worry it's a lack of moral rest a lack of physical rest and it changes your mood constantly I might also say it this way that worry in a man it's it's it's a it's a love of change in disgu because you are longing to change because man is not always happy in the state that he found himself he always long for his situation to change for his state to change for his condition to change and then he bring a lot of thoughts to your mind and then for and after a while you don't have Tranquility anymore that's why where you find worry you will hear complain and lamentation crying that's why when if you find worries be careful if you find worry somewhere you will find Amnesia you will find lust you will find competition you will find lack of patience and so forth amen amen am am and when man reach that state he's in a complete total Amnesia amen amen let me read something in the scripture first before I move forward let me go to the book of lamentation lamentation chapter 3 lamentation 3 verse 37 I'm talking to God's holy people because the holy people of God understand the language of their [Music] father the Bible says who is he that sath and he cometh to pass when the Lord commanded it not because most of the time when something bad happened to you when a problem happened to you you think that God is not aware of it and we are the one informing God about the situation and then you begin to inform God Lord why do you see me in such a state are you the one informing God before it happened to you God already knew it's going to happen God already allow it to happen instead of crying a Christian should [Applause] say why did God allow this to hit me what is the lesson he want me to learn amen amen amen amen this these are question you should ask yourself as a Christian instead of staying all night crying oh Lord why am I suffering like this oh Lord do you really see me you are the one informing God are you the one informing God [Applause] Hallelujah 38 out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth not evil and good that's why a Christian when something good comes we praise God when something evil happen we say glory to God because you must know that nothing can happen to a Christian without God giving permission for it Hallelujah glory to God Amen that's why me I always call Amnesia a virus it's a virus that usually attack Christians when it's attack Christian he brings them to to to forget to forget their nature to forget their position hallelujah amen why why a human being should he wherefore do a living man complain ver9 amen for the punishment of his sins amen amen amen amen oh Lord now I was talking to human beings and with the Bible now let me go to God's Own dictionary in the message get ready to save yourself February uh February 2nd 1958 paragraph 20 and electronically 39 yeah this is in French is 39 the message of the messenger of the hour says this listen to me carefully worry my friend no one of us is exempt of it but we want God to help us tonight about worries when you will have the thoughts of God so that we think like God William Mar brandham says this now sometime we ask ourself why don't we possess all these big things that other have we are God's [Applause] children those hidden are [Applause] prospering why am I not prospering glory to God [Applause] glory to [Applause] God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh oh I love this [Applause] atmosphere you are the one anointing me [Applause] [Music] now so am am I go crazy right [Applause] here don't we possess these great things that other have why are not things getting better and better for us and some of you are saying that night why only trouble in my home other people are at peace everything only coming to me to me to me to me why [Applause] me this is Brother Bram saying [Music] it glory to God now listen to brother Bram speaking Oh Glory listen to what he say brother Bram says this I don't want things to always get better and better for me concerning the things of the world I don't want everything to be always working good every time it's going good good good good no no no no no no no no no no no no glory [Applause] Hallelujah I would rather that I go better and better in God hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] this is Brother Bram talking I would rather have this to go better and better in God because concerning the things of this world to have these big things many so much money and all the time in happiness because I have money I can get everything I want be careful on that one amen when you see such a things be careful brother Bram say I would rather in my life I want to go better and better in God Amen it means that a Christian is submissive to the will of [Applause] God amen amen let me continue to uh ask our dictionary of the hour in the sermon be certain of God 1959 January the 25th paragraph 18 read it with me and follow me brother Bram says this are you ready to move on we have these last weeks and I verify some of these things and I noticed that the people that I thought that they were even the colonel thought they were big people in the world but they put more sent the emphasize on worldly things temporal things declaring all the time God uh God gave me something bigger and bigger like this and that God give God give God give and so forth and brother Bram say you are bluffing in other words you are fooling yourself two Christian met together do you know that God gave me two cars I have two houses now I'm going to go to South Africa and I'm going to have my vacation and go to Europe and enjoy my time no no no no no that's not Christian brother [Music] say the principal theme of our conversation is the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] amen amen when two Christian meet together and they're speaking all the time about material things it's a seduction from God it is a seducing Spirit don't worry I will continue reading what brother Bram say brother Bram say it's enticing when I meet you when you meet me speak about what God has done speak about and I will tell you what God did talk to me about what did brother preach talk to me about brother Bram cour and then he will create an atmosphere and God will be with you everywhere [Applause] paragraph 19 big material things never always reflect God's will if you always thinks that big material things shows the will of God so Joe Biden will go to heaven the pope will go to heaven because they have every wealth in this world maon the president of France will go to [Music] heaven and it's going to be a heaven of disorder if you go to heaven you find the pope there just remember you in hell not in heaven [Applause] are you still following me brother Bram says this the Bible says this brother Bram say God makes the rain to fall on the just and the unjust the sun rises upon the just and when the rain come down it's upon theil and upon the whe and the wit is glorifying God and The Tear also glorify God glory to God amen amen amen are you still following said by what the world needs today it is not a bluff of Faith to try to Bluff yourself into something and call it spiritual I'm sorry but let me be free and speak something they call spiritual what always really touches me when you meet a pastor you ask him how is the church oh God is working in this church you know what blind people are seeing and you know are walking and the word is preached mly is it true brother but Judas did all of that Judas have the word [Laughter] Glory Judah had all of that he healed the sick he preached the word what is the difference between you and Judas glory to God that is not the sign of you being [Applause] spiritual you might have all these big things you can have sign and wonders we are not at the at the at at the main thing yet brother says this he say faith let me read it from Brother BR he says sometime sometime faith will do great miracle and still doesn't come from a spiritual [Applause] heart glory to God pastor Pastor oh God bless me I have two Cadillac up there that's not the Bing brother stepen God bless me oh we we have people speaking in tongues that is not give me the M thing give me the main thing [Music] brother Charles he doesn't like gift in the church I have gift in my church oh brother Charles he doesn't want Miracle God does miracle in my church we have BL that that have seen and creep that walk and those that were deaf spoke by my through my Ministry but I cannot build on that that's not the [Applause] end and brother says that Divine Healing it's only a bait that you show to the fish now listen to me carefully when you show the ba to the fish you catch the fish and now you already got the fish in the and you continue to show him the bait you already CAU the fish but you continue to show him the bait preach hallelujah our Lord didn't he declare that many will come to me that day and say have not I did this and that in your name somewhere brother says he says he will be the preacher say Lord I pray for the sick oh I have a big campaign get out of [Applause] here depart from me are you following me yes I will say to them depart from me you workers of iniquity what is Iniquity is when something that you know to do right and don't do it he would say I never knew you and brother we are living in that day that's why you can even raise 10 dead every day but if you don't like brother Steven I don't care about [Applause] you brother Bram says this a [Music] Christian never has been caught by miracle when I see Miracle it's good God operate Miracle but I have to see the sermon behind the voice behind amen amen amen amen amen what we need [Music] today it is not a bunch of material things we have that we don't need greater churches we don't need greater congregations to know that you have God you don't have to fill this uh church here to know that you have God even a church of 10 believer like the Church of Ephesus have only 12 believer all of them fill with the spirit he was more than the Church of a thousand people where they have gift without love amen amen I am in the house of my father I must say things St it's about God's children [Music] talking brother say we don't need more on the radio and on television it's good but that's not the main thing we don't need so many more of these things but what we need today to be spiritual is a person that will humble themsel before God if they have not got a penny and will pray until that Spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God and in the heart a Revival takes place on the inside of the heart that changes their attitude an atmosphere that they live in that's why the Bible [Music] says let this man that was in Christ be also in you him who was in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but he humble himself he took the condition of a man that's why you can do everything without humility zero zero the love of God in my heart with humility will always make me believe that brother Steven is greater than me and brother Steven will say brother CH is greater than me and from there I will respect him he will respect me he won't respect me because of gray hair I won't respect him because he's tall because of the responsibility God put on him because he's carrying an inside man that man is Jesus [Applause] Christ and if Jesus is in you he will bring his character in you and the character of Jesus Christ it's a loving character that's why he say that he loves so much the world that he gave his only begotten son it means he loved those that were unlovable amen amen amen amen amen amen I want to keep uh catch my quick let me go quickly that's why brother Bram say man he said man is always unstable in life always unstable never been satisfied by his state or condition that's why man usually don't know what he's after you find a brother he comes closer to you brother I have a problem what's going on brother I just need $200 brother $200 take he leave he won't go too far hey I should have told him 300 [Applause] man doesn't know what he's looking for he's unstable unconstant never be satisfied are you still following me that's why brother Bram says that state of things in that condition that man lives it will affect his spiritual health and physical health many of the illness we had 60% of it it's coming from [Applause] worries preach Amen to whom shall we go June 16 uh June 6 196 paragraph 10 let me take what is important from the brother Bram says this you know man have never changed he always continue wondering in the [Applause] world looking for pleasure toss here and there never satisfied he's asking for, let me tell you a little story you it might make you laugh a brother came to me he said pastor father can you loan me please even $50 I I will take it brother I give him $50 every month I begin to give him $50 $50 $50 and after a while uh uh father can you raise the the money a little bit and I say I'm going to start giving him $100 oh thank you thank you thank you Father thank you thank you Pastor after one year Pastor can you raise up just a little bit what is wrong what are you looking for because man never get satisfied never satisfy never reach good conclusion never find rest this is why many people commit suicide here in the United States and all over the world and they are killing worries worries worries will bring comparison competition jealousy will stre now of worries jealousy amen never reach good conclusion never found rest he found state that he was when he left God In the Garden of Eden and he went and tried to just uh uh take care of himself that's why you find man thought that he doesn't need God anymore he must do everything himself and his intelligence so brought him to his own destruction a human being who's making a weapon to kill another human being so they are they are making weapons it's not to kill or to hunt but to kill other human being and then life life is a gift of God and no one have a right to take somebody's [Applause] life man doesn't want God that's why we have all this mess and by BR went further he says the we can never even use God's law in the politic in the political world today because L because man thinks that he himself he can take care of himself and by trying to take care of himself he's going here and there trying here and there and missing the point amen he start taking care of himself and he found out that it's a difficult way to follow and he looks like he doesn't even care about the end of his [Music] life Man live without without thinking about tomorrow every day day by day but the Christian is looking at the future amen amen and if we can sit down and do the inventory and ask ourself a question to know why are we here how did we make it to this earth and who brought us here and what will be our Eternal destination ask yourself a question why are you in this church and why are you not in another church why did God give you this pastor and not another Pastor what is God expecting from you man never thought about these things you live just knowing that if the Lord car you tomorrow might be the end of your life what will be your condition what will be your state after death because life doesn't stop with physical death amen amen amen are you still following me amen that's why you see when the children of Israel came out of Egypt God showed them several miracles yes amen amen great wonders but in the wilderness a little something they forget all the goodness of God even here a child can be really severely sick and even the hospital say we can't do anything and the pastor pray and then everything comes back to normal after one month and another child sick you forget that miracle and you begin to tremble isra all the great wonders in Egypt listen to me carefully God promised to Abraham that your seed will take care of this land I will bless your seed they will take care of they will take this land and they will go they will sourn in slavery and I will pull your people from there and when the time came God never gave them the law God brought them under grace and grace provided the way and he was by the prophet Moses Moses was God's grace on and in the wild he was always complaining complaining and they and they and those complaints were so much until Israel requested the law but it was not God's will to give them the Lord that's what brother Bram says amen sometime by our attitude we force God to give us a permissive [Music] will that's why look when God say Abraham you will have a son he went to his wife God say we will have a child one year two five seven eight maybe you didn't hear God well God wanted to say take my younger maid than here usually when a woman sin he always bring death and Abraham went and took and when is glory to God glory to I have a baby God say Abraham this is not what I told you worries worries will bring you to fabricate your own way and you will live go way that's why many times we have many Isel but [Applause] never why impatient impatient impatient so much worries oh I have patience because worries will eat up your patience it will eat up your faith and you find man making his own ways oh thank you Jesus Oh the child is born Abraham this is not what I said shut up you know when a promise take longer God usually give you time but when unbelief get in by worries you usually delay the Fulfillment of the promise that's why Israel took so long in the they should have done three days and make it to the promised land and they took 40 years 40 years in the wilderness why that generation must be wiped up those generation of Fighters have to be completely wiped up that's why you see today in message you see war in the message churches and you will notice the pastor is here he he talk to people uh to to to work with him in the ministry after six month they want to be like a pastor that's why when that woman went to see Jesus I want my children one of them to sit on the right hand and they Jesus say can can they drink off the same Cup in other words are you going to go through the persecution like oh yes we can do it he said yes that's true but when he comes to the position that is up to the father amen amen [Music] amen that's why we have all the trouble everything going wrong in the message because people love to be Pastors in this message listen to me carefully I went to several churches and I found that those churches are only Workshop they are not churches it's just shopping he say when you become serious with God God will be serious with [Applause] you if only we can get away from this little facet so that God maybe he will do it maybe I believe I hope he will do it oh you know he promised that's the way we want to believe that it means this bring your thoughts bring your [Music] will below the will of God let the will of God come and dwell in you when we pray we say th will be done on on Heaven as as on Earth and brother says the will of God sometime doesn't match our will it might be even sometime contrary to your desire amen amen amen are we together I'm heading somewhere I'm going to bring you somewhere says this in paragraph 34 B he said you can make your wealth uh your foundation you might have SE a lot of money leave a lot of money to your children what will that do what is the end of those wealth American listen to me I know you're not American you are children of God born in the United States listen what will be the end of those wealth worries deception conflict uh disagreement fall killing Fe killing murder and sometime it will lead to suicide this is what this is the spectacle that we see all around all the wars it's just about interest interest it is just a war of Interest after money money money money it is the root of all evil because Bank May Fail they can close or something may happen and then you lose your money in those uh bankco [Music] games and then you take a I mean a weapon and shoot yourself you see that Foundation is not Eternal your money will never give you as an eternal Foundation you cannot use popularity for an eternal found that is the greatest sin of America trying to be popular women want to dress to be popular and man want to act like a to be popular all those little things that are happening and the way happen I don't want to touch it on the first night but I was not saying the third night but to be popular generally popularity will lead to sin and shame popularity it will bring four or three or four marriages and all kind of mess that's why you see here in Europe in United States if a woman to be popular she's she she she's a wife of a president and she will divorce the the president and it's all over the news and everybody's talking about her because sheor then she will get into another marriage but you already dead a wife one woman two two living husband you done you doom you doom woman was made for the man amen I already heard such a thing a woman that left her husband and to divorce her husband just to be popular on social media and I says this I told you 60% of sickness illness today it comes from the fact that men live in worries in worries complaining all the time complaining tomorrow you have heartburn this and cancer and this and this going on can I read the infallible word of God spoken word of God April 4th 1956 paragraph four and five brother Bram says this you know I was uh talking to the young people here coming here and I was telling them I told them to always be happy when the Bible speak in first Thessalonians 5:17 always Rejoice because the Bible knows because God knows that situation will come that will make you sad but don't look at those situations look at your God God already knew he will know that your neighbor will make you happy he know that somebody will get you mad he know that your husband will get you mad he know that your wife will be a headache to you put that in God's bank account and look unto Jesus and Let Jesus take your place amen that's why me every day before I go to preach the word I always ask myself a question my heart do you have something against somebody ah because I want to be clear before I get to the pulpit because I have if I have something against brother Steven I won't get in the pit to I will be a hypocrite amen amen amen we yes [Music] God want us to be always happy God doesn't want you to be sad can you say again amen God he doesn't want to be sad it means things that will bring world stories will come they will come to you but put that in God's account and look at the cross put that in God's account let God handle it God will take care of it continue let me continue brother brandham we yes yes do you know what CA CES what a bad sadness can cause and those bad attitude will cause all day long you are you are angry you don't talk to nobody and then having evil thoughts one after the other all day and at that time and then all kind of de ision are taking place in your heart that that finish with him finish a decision brother call me from France this morning he he explained me his situation I say brother I say you right but the decision you took is not good because you took that decision upon the effect of deception every decision that is taken with anger or after disappointment it's coming from Satan am bring your decision I say brother leave your decision he said thank you Pastor yes and those bad attitude they are so uh is one of the the the the those uh it's something very [Music] bad and it's about 60% the base or the cause of all sickness yes brother BR I'm saying yes yes all this tantrum of anger that you have remember you are only developing cancer you are developing ulcer or something of that sort by getting angry doing that am can you say amen I want to see everybody saying amen and then tell God help me Lord I don't want to do that [Applause] [Music] again when you get in those State against somebody saying I will never go back to that place he will see I will tell him all for [Music] truth this is I'm reading brother it is not me it is not brother Sten it is your [Music] Prophet ah he will he he will see I took this so long I can't take it anymore I can't take it anymore when you talk like that you are closer to the ditch amen amen amen you know our brother here you know how they say I can take anything but this one I can't take it I can't take it no more I I just can't I just can't I just I just enough enough [Applause] enough you are closer to the ditch you cannot take take anything Jesus came to bear what you cannot be give Jesus your lord he will find the solution give him your burden when anger comes don't take any decision don't make any [Music] decision amen amen I'm going to tell him all truth straight remember you are the one going to pay for it you are in that state you will pay for it and says you will pay for it you will have rep repercussion that's why you will see lat when you have such after a while you get sick maybe you have a headache because your tension your blood and some people fell down with a stroke you will pay for it brother brandham continue they usually tell a story that in the in the morning there was a a robin a robin love Red Robin and he was uh upon a tree and was singing to his uh to his mate and the little mate went with went to uh to him and said so the two the two Red Robin were talking about men and he told his men he say I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm really worrying this morning about a subject something and they had M say what he say he said we never [Music] worry we never worry but I always ask myself those poor creatur call human being when I see them walking down they Down Under the the treat their face are always the always the face locked up what is wrong open your face let me tell you you don't only laugh with your teeth you can laugh with your face we can see Joy on your face free your face free your face say Amen people of [Applause] God somebody come to visit [Music] you locked up even your children are afraid of [Applause] you free your [Applause] face you can laugh but we can tell this is fake this is fake when you laugh laugh is a combo with your [Applause] face hallelujah hallelujah when I was right there in the in brother St offic and when brother Steven was saying here would tell he's laughing all the way there he was happy and I was so happy I say oh God this is what we need this is my sermon and many times and it's always he means something it's me it's mingle with a lot of love and I feel him that he love his church I can tell there is an expression when you laugh and there is also a laugh of [Applause] [Applause] anger I'm happy I'm happy I'm happy a green laugh it's not ripe in our rap [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] life what is wrong me me he's playing with fire you the one playing with fire you don't understand what you're doing hallelujah look at these human beings I ask myself questions maybe they don't have a heavenly father that watch over them like his watching over as Red Robin Red Robin they were not created in the image of God God never spoke to the angel that you would take my place it is only man can take the place of God because man was made in the image of God and he gave him a domain and he told man that you are the god of the earth and I'm the god of the universe giv you the responsibility to preach the gospel to distribute his thoughts but not the greed Robin That's why Red Robin are asking themselves questions it's it's almost the same brother Bram say you never heard of you never heard of you never heard of a red robing with high blood pressure let me ask you a question you who have pet when did you take your pet to the hospital for high blood pressure show me all your chicken or something to the hospital for high blood pressure did you ever see a vet doctor looking at your dog and say that's a high blood pressure have you heard a chicken with high blood pressure your cat see no no no no you would never hear a car an ambulance car going to get a red [Music] H they always live following the way that God provided for them it is always as human that behave bad from all the creation of God I mean Earth only man that has been rebellious all the time he received such a great privilege to be made in the image of God because but it's the most rebellious creature that's why brother Bram say nature is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God because uh fish die uh bird die and animal die and uh bany life die and they ask themselves a question we didn't do anything until when we will continue to die until when our Master will get back to his position so that we can stop being I mean dying that's why brother I'm saying everything that live have a spirit even animal have Spirit even trees have that's why you will see magician and wites they work with all this kind of stuff because there is Spirit to that that's why brother says God will never live without a witness amen everything you do there is a witness somewhere Somebody's Watching amen amen that's why your pet is watching you he doesn't understand your chicken is looking at you they don't understand you I was saying even dogs today they are so amazed the way human being are treating them God gave a law because everything in the word is under law there is a law of reproduction every every kind after its own but today man is marrying a dog to break the law of God so the dog is the dog is looking like what is wrong I went one day in our country there were two vill fighting and they were killing each other two Villages over there they were living neighboring Village so the people of this Village could not go to that one and that one not going to the other and then uh the stat sent military and people there sold even some of the religious leader went there to reconcile them it never worked I went there it was not me it was God that sent me there I went there and I asked the brother I say please I want you to build uh I mean a conference place in the middle of the both of of of the two Villages so when I begin to preach in the middle of the Lord the people from this Village came and they stood on that face and the other one came and they stood on their side and all of them are watching me and I told them I say God made man in his own image and made him a master of everything that is in the world now you the Masters you are quarreling stra everything back Bing each other and then you broke Fellowship now I'm going to ask you a question both of you both sides the people of this Village don't go to that Village the people of the village B don't go to Village a I say but s but but surprisingly I see that your dog your pet are going to one Village to the other and they don't have any problem I see your goat moving from one Village to another Village and your chicken are leaving the village to the other Village I see the dog of this place they go get their mate to the other Village they get married there and then the the the the rooster over there are chasing the hand over there why didn't you stop them from meeting each other why didn't you stop your Beast to meet each other say if you can do that they will accuse you to God if you try they will say Lord the people that you give us like Master they don't understand the purpose that you gave them they divided separated themselves and they want to separate our fellowship two animals and suddenly I begin to see them moving closer and they other one begin to move closer and they begin to move closer before you know it when I say who want to believe the Lord Jesus Christ I come from word of baptism all of them mixed together they came to the word of baptism and what did God do to show that it was God who sent me they went and get a woman uh who was uh who contracted HIV and they sent her from the city back to the Village so she can die over there she could not walk and everything so they brought me the woman I pray for her and God completely healed her until today she's alive and they went together to the world of baptism and I called the chief uh from this side and the chief and the Elder of and I say come together let's see and they begin to hug each other love man man get back to your position you are a God on this [Applause] Earth amen says it is always as human that behave bad only men it's men who destroy nature he's always always uh destroy himself we are the knowing about science you know we are intelligent PE you are beings yes uh birds Don't Change since God created a bird from the time of Adam if you look at the way they built their nest they never changed they never have update never never version but if you look at the houses in the United States are not the house that was built by the forefather everything is up the car that we driving today they are not the same car that brother Bram was riding with everything is moving on and it's these and and it's under that uh uh progress the progress it's in that uh progress that also sin also is progressing and we are progressing with sin that's why today we have homosexuality we have a lesbian I told you you here you are not people of America you are Christian astronaut you are astronaut amen amen do not be changed and molded by man's civilization I won't go too far anymore because I'm going to go straight to the point I'm going to read this brother says this in the sermon my life story I don't have a paragraph it's just the story so it comes from the voice of God brother Bram says this uh page 26 because here brother Bram is explaining to us his life with his wife they have a very modest life they had a small house with two story building he was only his rent was $4 a month at that time $4 a month and brother Bram say you he was a St TW story there was almost nothing but but they were happy and brother Bram is saying something he say I understand this that's happiness doesn't consist of the amount of worldly stuff you process but in the satisfaction that you get with what has been given to you in other words a Christian he's always happy of his State God say I will never leave you in other words bring your problem to God he will take care of you don't force anything don't push you will produce we are working because the bible say that if you don't work you won't eat but don't try to get rich before the time God will give you money but wait for God to give you in his time God give worldly stuff worldly material stuff but wait for the time don't be don't try to be like brother so and so I was telling the brother I say you today you today you are envying me H you want to be like me it's good but can you take the road I took before I get where I am with all the trial I went through before you want to be like brother St do you know how he suffered to be here all so go through the same way don't burn step and take shortcut don't Che a short cut and search for a quick solution is oh when you go to the shortcut Ishmael you will produce isma believer let's follow God's Prophet advice I'm going to read something here in Watchmen what the night it's uh November the 30th 1958 paragraph 30 listen to what brother say paragraph 13 let me check the time now oh my God he say none of us is immune against problems that's why we are not different from they die we die they get sick we get sick sometime they even get wealth we don't have but what is the difference we are in the promise but they don't have the promise after death it's already but we after death we going to Glory this is what he he say none of us is immune from trouble God never promised to exempt us from all sicknesses God never said when you believe in me never sick you won't have any problem so how are you going to know the power of God if you don't have trouble how will you know the power of God how are you going to have a testimony you don't how are you going to appreciate his power his [Applause] love but it is written his strength is sufficient and God will never bring something upon you that is more than you can bear therefore it's a consolation a comfort for us to know that to know that it's a comfort for us to know that things trouble will come they must come that's why he say in the seven Church ages I didn't read brother Bram say character is not a gift it's a victory and you won't have the victory without a fight and you won't have a fighter without an enemy and our enemy common enemies the devil and know this that the true war starts the true War start when you get the Holy Ghost this is when double attacks he even increased the attack that's why you will see H many time I have counseling with Brothers Pastor since I'm in the message nothing is working the children are getting sick and nothing is working I try this business it's not working I try this is not working oh before I get to the message everything was fine I just look at him when he finish all his complaint I say ah brother so today I understand that God love you so much when I say that they say pastor pastor [Applause] Pastor I say but brother I see that God love you so much he say Pastor suffering like this you say God L me I say trial trial and test it's what it is a manifestation of the love of God and I told the church when a child goes to school he won't go to the next level until he goes through the test and every time you go through another Lev they increase and they make things more when you go to the university you will see the math is more harder in University and the test become very very hard tough and you are sweaty why that's why the more you you growing in the Lord the more your test level is increasing the more the trial your trial goes with your spiritual level so be happy when you going through test be happy especially if you know that you are living the perfect will of God be happy then you see Tri keep multiply and problem keep coming one after the other you look you everything is in is is in order in your life it's a proof that God lovees you amen amen why worry that's why brother say you cannot change the color of your eyes or make it blue or what if you are one I mean 6ot and you want to be I mean 11t can you do that so if you can't be 11 why just submit to the will of God that's why brother Bram says this I'm going to read this in the sermon the red uh flash of uh uh red flashlight of his coming I have to finish and to close stop in this sermon brother Bram says paragraph 165 he said oh God I know that grant me the grace to never complain I want this to be our prayer tonight oh God give the so that our life can be no matter how we suffer no matter what happen no matter how many people turn against me I know one thing in my [Music] life it will take one thing in my life as long as I'm getting old my friends are getting smaller and it will take longer as I continue to move on and I know one thing they will come time after a while that no one will come to me to ask me any advice those who knew me from my will be already gone if I continue to live I will have less and less friends and I know that one day I will go and listen to what he say and I hope that God will never let Satan Crown me to make me an old man with a bad attitude in other words an old man when you get old nobody want to be around you an indifferent man and my wife a I mean a woman of striving brother Bram says there are people as they growing old they become even very bad you can't them they always have something to say they get for nothing he begin to speak all kind of stuff the the the older they get the worst the children are playing if the children cross that Grandma property she get upset on the neighborhood for nothing all the time even without any problem C I mean some women are like that when they get they are very I pray for brother that our life with the fruit of the spirit love joy long suffering patience patience truth faith in the Holy Ghost that's where brother Bram says that brother says in the sermon I to stop the the time of the time the United paragraph 8 he says I don't want to speak a lot it's about people who complain truly I believe that one of the most horrible things is to see a man or a woman who constantly [Applause] complain I always thought oh God keep me from being that you see that will weaken your faith all the time know it's only you I know that as we getting old one every one of us something will happen to us and something will happen when we grow up because bad experience I mean people who were with you die today this year 2 years 5 years and then some of your friend are no longer there and if you continue to live you will begin to have worry after worry after worry after worry but you got to take all those worry and give it to the Lord everything that is happening listen to me carefully my friend we cannot correct God everything that happen in this earth it is God's will we have nothing to teach God we we just have to accept God's way of doing things I know that these things will continue to get until you as as you growing old it's always like that but I believe one thing that is most horrible is when Satan CR the life of somebody give you a man an old man or an old woman that is very bad I believe that I won't reach that point I will not I believe that I cannot I will always bear my burden and and which point that I want my life to be by the glory of God all his his loving kindness patience all the time his uh kindness his uh peace his kindness and to be filled with the Holy Spirit that's why I always speak to my church in this life you will always have an enemy because your father have enemies the one who didn't like your father won't like you therefore you don't be an enemy to anyone don't hate anyone don't have any grudges against anyone amen brother says this live for that man that hat you that day on Calvary paragraph 88 leave for that man that could kill you if he had a chance that's what they did to him they kill him and he died so that he can save them that's what eternal life is all about and when that get into your heart then you are looking at Heaven straight giving it to sacrifice everything that you and you give it as a lamp giving it wool that's where brother Bram says that God I didn't read that quote because I have to spell God don't want that everything in your life must work always right God doesn't like it that you know the brother that you looking like everything is going good for their life their business are good they are flourishing that brother that you envy you might look you say I want to be like Joe Biden or Trump but if they give you the place of Joe Biden you run away all the problem he have with that Prosperity that's why brother say God don't want that everything must work good in your life all the time look at isra when they were in Egypt when the Pharaoh that did not know Joseph came it was the time that the SE of the Amorite reaches and then and that Pharaoh multip suffering on Israel it is God that allowed us it was to put into Israel The Thirst to go back to their country so everything you see uncomfortable Tri difficulties does don't want you to get used to this easy life everything that happen to you it isow by God it is to teach you [Music] something God doesn't want ego to get used to the Earth that's why God will be happy the day that you will be alone in your bedroom and you will say God no no no no h i don't like this I want you to come let go home why because that's what God is so that you come out that you understand that happiness is not here happiness is somewhere God bless you I stop right Let each one of us say Lord I understand tonight change my life so that the fruit of the spirit dominate I decided to stop with Wars today as you help me the pastor will pray for you may you bow your head and pray to your God this is between you and God what do you want to tell what do you want to tell God and what do you expect from God based on what you heard tonight pray speak to God tell God something and at the end the pastor will pray for all of us because me also I'm not immune from trouble I'm also one of them when he will pray he will pray for all of us so you pray yourself this is between you and God pray than [Music] [Music] all [Music] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy father and for speaking to us thank
