[Applause] [Music] hallelujah i don't i don't uh nobody gave me any praise reports or prayer requests um so i i'm gonna i'm gonna thank him for this move that we're still kind of three quarters into this is stressful time on a family you know with every you find out what you got and what you don't want and just put stress on everything it was pretty much just some uh lily and me and rebecca or edie that did it and uh now we got help you know we're rebecca and chris but it so i'm praising god for that he he gave us his house amen and it's just every time we just sit down and look around and think about it we're just more thankful it's just more what we wanted uh now here's my prayer request because um um last night you know the house is cluttered there's boxes there's bags it's everything everywhere nothing's set up yet hardly um and uh chris was kind enough last night to um uh buy our dinner down here at surfing turf it's just down the road from us and uh now he can't find his wallet so i want to ask anybody in here to raise their hand if you've ever lost anything in the go and god found it for you he provided he found it i know because i've heard the testimonies i just want to acknowledge that so he's still looking for it so i want to ask god to reveal where that wallet is you know and just show the young man they they also have something to thank god about they purchased a camper so they're going to be once they get married they're going to be living with us on the property so yes ma'am the girl run the blood around that she did the exam on friday they put an emergency they called all over gastonia they sent me to shelby where my daughter worked you know to get the ultra song but i'm standing here today to tell the devil he's a liar that wasn't enough to choose this morning yesterday to come and attack my family but he's not tracking my family talking attacking god family and because my family is a griffin in the palm of god hands and no devil in hell i'm telling him this morning amen to praise my god as i never did before and i want to thank god for your victory this morning thank you amen he's a liar amen yes sir mine is twofold the lady i asked you the church to pray for miss pam i got a call on thursday or text on thursday from her daughter that stated she came out of surgery everything went fine they were the doctor cleared her to go home with her last bit of chemo on friday so i want to thank everyone for that for your prayers when my family and i wasn't here in church they tested me and said that it was coveted in the antibodies and all of this got the results back they initially didn't call me took all the blood the lord put on my heart to check online at the results that came back as i'm reading over each result i i looked at my husband and i said i said honey i said it looks like there the tests are showing that it they were testing me for leukemia and they've been doing this since march and i didn't know so you know those emotions that we're told to give to the lord starts working on my heart and my husband looked at me and he said no honey he said we're going to pray against it i said okay baby so i i got upset and i began to pray that whole week i said lord do the lying vanities i'm a child of of yours you told me that those promises are mine i said and i'm healed i'm not going to give way to this um you know body got fatigued got tired got fatigued got tired lord i'm gonna keep pushing and keep pushing and keep pushing not one doctor called and gave me a result about what the blood said came to church left church told my husband i said i'm not gonna believe it so i stand here today defying what those tests say because i'm a child of god and i'm healed just keep me in your prayers amen thank you lord anybody got an unspoken they would like to acknowledge brother sam if you mind coming up and praying over these things in the remainder of the service hallelujah i'm looking forward to hearing what the lord has in store for us today amen my mind lord jesus it's you that we feel here this morning lord lord have you been expressed through the congregation this is not the spoken word church lord god by name only but lord we hear our precious sister pam lord expressing the spoken word speaking to the devil and tell him he's a liar and lord jesus our sister here lord god speaking to the devil and tell him he's a liar and as a congregation now lord we join our faith with their faith lord and we call upon you lord who spoke the word originally lord jesus and you told us that by your stripes we were healed lord god it doesn't say that we will be healed or we might be healed it said we are healed lord and there's only one thing that's standing between us lord god and our healing and that's our faith in your word lord and father what we're seeing in these sisters lord in their testimonies is the fruit of brother stephen's labor lord god because we know this faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word and how could we hear without a preacher and how could a preacher preach except that he be sent lord and lord i think of how that sister teresa and i just sit around the coffee table lord god and we chew on these nuggets and the little things that have come across this pulpit lord god and how it's just increasing our faith lord god and now we're lord seeing the anointing lord god of those sweet smelling precious ointments lord god and now the joy of the lord filling our hearts lord god the peace lord that passes all understanding oh father we could only be thankful to you lord jesus because we're lord we're not looking towards our righteousness lord we're looking towards the righteousness of the lamb of god who was slain for our transgressions father and we just want to express our thanks to you lord god we want to thank you lord god that you're still el shaddai you're still our provider lord god and how that you provided this home for our brother and for his family lord and lord we want to thank you in advance for finding lord that wallet for our brother chris lord jesus lord jesus we're believers lord god and what believers do is they believe lord god and so lord god we call things that are not as though they were lord jesus we don't walk by sight we walk by faith father and we're so thankful lord jesus to be a part of this great family of god lord and father we're thankful for the worship lord god and all those that you've anointed with gifts father and we're so plentiful in this congregation father and we just pray that our worship will be worthy of the king of kings and the lord of lords and lord jesus we just ask father that you'll touch every unspoken need father you're a discerner of the thought and the intent of the heart lord god and you know every word we're going to speak before we speak it father but you like to hear your children ask father and lord you said that whatever we asked if we believed we could have whatever we ask for lord god and lord you wouldn't return us a stone for an egg lord jesus or a serpent lord god father but you would give us lord god our the the portion that we've asked for lord and not only do you give it to us but you give it to us abundantly lord god and so now we're asking lord jesus christ that you'll take these words that will be spoken across this pulpit and you'll turn it into revelation and that revelation will become the stimulation and the stimulation will become a joy unspeakable and full of glory and lord jesus we pray now father for the offering lord jesus that it will be a free will offering may every dime every nickel every penny put into this offering be from the bottom of our hearts lord god not by constraint lord but willingly lord and then may you take that offering and multiply it lord god to supply the needs of this congregation lord the needs of the building lord god it's in our brother's heart to make lord jesus and lord god will give you thanks honor and praise for everything we have that's good has come from you in jesus name amen y'all can be seated as the brothers come around brother daley has a song he'd like to sing this morning it's good to have him back amen praise the lord amen praise the lord everybody ah the fiery darts been coming but um somehow i been pretty oblivious to them you know just um this song i want to dedicate to sister pam and it's a song my and everyone else here it's a song my father used to sing many years ago um you know back in the days they had the horse and buggy so you had if you had a horse back then that's precious to you and you take very well care of that horse and somehow you're quite attached to it but um what we have now is automobiles so i have one and um turns out that um the sunroof drains got clogged and i didn't know so the water would drain in the car and i didn't drive it for a time so i would drain in the car fill up the back of the trunk where the batteries and all that technology and everything else in there and totally soaked it when i finally brought it to it was like a swimming pool in the back of the car so um we got the water out and it'd be 24 000 to correct problem the harness was totally damaged and um the insurance said it's gonna ride off well i'm attached to my car so um i said no no no i'll fix it just let me keep it and pay me whatever the balance is so that's what they did so the spoken word tabernacle is where we worship and the spoken word is what we have and we've been hearing that and i've been saying that car is going to run that car is going to run that car is going to run it's going to be back and i drove it here this morning to the glory of god [Applause] [Music] i have a friend a precious friend oh how he loves me he saves his

seated a few minutes before we raise you up again amen where are the folks at july the 4th amen [Laughter] how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand okay okay that's what we want to see amen anybody finish their cod somebody finish it praise god blessed be the name of the lord we need to talk to the trustees and see if we can start ordering the 70 weeks of daniel amen we appreciate all the family members here i heard brother john already mentioning we do not have visitors in this church we got family members so when you're here welcome good to see you and we trust is going to be a blessing for you this morning amen brother robert reminded me that for our question and answer session on july the 16th somebody have not signed up yet so if you want to take it uh go ahead and sign it so we know that somebody is already covering that uh that date again it's in it's on july the 16th amen the youth you know what to do with the deacon if you can go ahead and move on and finish that up so we'll have everything cleared amen the devil has been fighting me back and forth left and right i don't know what's going on but i know there is a blessing on the way amen my wife is back [Music] she's somewhere there so we thank you all for your prayers and for everything especially my mom stepping in and helping and your prayers and all the effort that you put up together to make me comfortable until we feel like everything is under control so god which we bless you for everything and whoever did something whether in word or deed or in prayer god richly bless you amen i don't know who gave me this but for some reason people are giving gifts they don't want me to know who but somebody gave me an airplane it's in my office and they wrote spoken word tabernacle and they put a picture of the cloud and it's a beautiful jet plane so i don't know maybe i keep saying we're going to take off we're going to land down [Laughter] so probably that's where it's coming from so whoever did it god richly bless you for everything brother robert doesn't want to even tell me who did it so thank you very much god richly bless you it looks beautiful and i like it amen i wish we can put it somewhere here but let's keep it in the office so if you want to see it you see me first amen lord's willing brother keith from jamaica will be with us the 24th of this month so he reach out to us lords willing once he get into the state he will be with us on sunday the 25th uh the 24th if you don't know brother keith just remember hello somebody do you remember that's why they came so when he's blazing that's how he goes amen a wonderful servant of god so lord's willing he will be with us here on sunday the 24th and he will be ministering for us so keep that in prayer so everything goes very well amen i already prepared your sermon for this morning and everything was prepared and the title was a little bit different but for some reason your boss shifted me amen amen it's not me i have to follow the gps that's a supreme gps your boss shift me so i have to stay up last night and do the everything back and forth according to the leadership of the boss so you need your bible handy because we will operate in a different route today we're still going to be in the air but have your bubble because we will operate differently amen i was just following the gps amen so before we do that let me read the quote here by god's grace so that quote will kind of prepare you a little bit you know this quote by the brother i'm saying bible teaching is a little treacherous it's dangerous amen and later you know kind of walking on the thin ice you see how careful you must be that's why we want to make sure everything's come up straight from the scripture the bible says and brother brother i'm saying so we know that you are placed on a solid foundation not on the minister because if he goes away which i'm not going to go away i'll stay with this message amen then you get in trouble brother brother i'm saying but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what i think to a complete understanding positionally this understanding is not just understanding but is understanding your position amen if you don't understand this it's a trouble i put up this quote first i didn't know that when when your boss began to shift me i began to see why he wanted that quote to be spoke uh to be put there amen a complete not a partial understanding amen a full understanding amen amen you know when we say completely on the seven amen a seven understanding positionally of what we are in christ not what you are in your family because that won't matter anything amen not your position in a family but your position in christ hallelujah your position in christ if you understand this position amen what random say and sometimes i think that preaching is a wonderful thing but i believe sometimes brother biller that teaching goes beyond that [Music] i don't know why people can't read this quote in the message everybody here brother branham said teaching goes beyond that's right [Applause] amen oh head knowledge hard knowledge he goes beyond it why does he go beyond amen it goes beyond that especially today why he said preaching usually catches the sinner bring him under condemnation by the water so the first step that the gospel approaches you brother kelly he brings somebody under condemnation anybody here when you get under condemnation you don't have any more power you are completely bereft you don't have any more strength amen but you need the teaching to now positionally in other words the teaching restore you back in power hallelujah don't worry my friend we're gonna climb amen he said preaching usually catches the sinner bring him under condemnation by the word but yes sir but teaching places you say because i'm a teacher i have coats you want trouble come and sit with me i will load you with coat until you get drunk with coat amen but teaching places demand positionally in other words when a man has been preached the gospel when he enter he's still in the air amen and the devil can push you to the right or to the left because you don't know first who you are so you need to be granted a certain way once you are grounded don't worry my friend he said but teaching places the man positionally what yes sir amen can i read it again he places you positionally what so this position is unfolding your identity [Music] amen so by positioning you begin to know who you are why is it important he says and we can do you see why we got trouble in the message do you see what people are tossed about because they were never positionally placed they were preached into for years but they were never positioned so you see 25 years in the message but he's in the air when they push him he's out [Music] hallelujah never rightly be able to have you might have faith you pray for the sick and somebody get here the pentecostal got that one that's right amen even a good baptist got that one [Music] amen rightly be able to have faith until what we know everybody okay so my subject this morning is move by right everybody okay you don't just move anyway [Music] everybody okay you move only by your right amen you didn't get it yet in other words you cannot move without knowing who you are [Music] usually i give you the subject i mean the data ladder your boss put it up differently amen you are moving by right you don't just move in the air you don't in other words here there is no adventuring amen because your position in christ when it's unfolded unto you you remove presumption amen in other words you do not adventure anymore without authority when you go to war you know what you're going to want and you know who you are and you know your weapon you don't enter hoping you know the outcome [Laughter] oh my god blessed be the name of the lord let's stand and read the portion of the scripture then you'll be seated hallelujah amen let's pray already so when i'm moving we move heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us lord we are committing this service unto the hand father may you move us completely away may you the holy spirit come and minister to this church in a specific way this morning be the alpha and the omega and we rebuke every demonic spirit away from this place in the name of jesus christ amen so we already live in the airport go to detroit 25. so don't wait for the title anymore oh i'm guessing this is not a guesswork amen determine 25. if you dare you can say amen [Laughter] blessed be the name of the lord amen everything he was fighting is going that's right you think brother mike was crying here just for a person you stand here you will know who's here not me i just came in i just blended amen detroit 25 verse 5. if you dare you can say amen if a present if present dwell together you might be seated so we fulfill that part of you standing for the scripture anybody okay i have a scripture in the bible where they stood for the scripture if you have a problem amen you say if brethren dwell together in unity you know amen not here if brethren dwell together and one of them died yes the four faces of roof move by right if one of them died and have no water so the case is very specific here we don't have to guess is he dead yes do you have the death certificate yes did the doctor pronounce him dead yes can we see the death certificate check does he have a child no so we are not broad we are very specific in the law now if there is no child the wife of the dead everybody okay everybody okay the wife of the dead shall not marry so that woman is locked right am i reading a different bible the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger do you know what he means he cannot marry outside of that family even though the husband is dead the death of the husband only removes the first hardship amen amen amen her husband water her husband's brother shall go into her and take her to him as a what so when the first husband died everybody care amen the one following him is locked anybody okay when the first husband was alive that man was free to marry any woman he wanted the death of the husband freed the woman but lock his little brother am i reading a different scripture anybody here so once the husband is dead the woman is locked in the family but the one following the husband is blocked you cannot marry another woman again in your life you are doomed anybody care anybody here in other words the inheritance of the woman is 100 percent guarantee anybody here 100 amen so naomi had no right to tell ruth that i don't have any more husband that's right amen amen anybody are we okay now we have no right to tell them that there is no more hope we already married in the family you must create a hope [Music] here because we are burned not to go anywhere [Music] she left her own inheritance by ignorance everybody okay so far we okay now take her to him as a wife and perform the water perform the water so it's an obligation the younger brother is under obligation he must the bible says this because i'm preaching already in matthew 22 verse 24 saying master moses said if a man having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed on to his brother when we say shall you don't really get it the bible says in mark 12 19 master moses wrote unto us if a man's brother died and leave his life with his wife behind him and leave water where did they learn this anybody okay that's his brother anybody here so it is an obligation by law you must you must should take his wife and raise up seed on to his brother anybody here so they continue with jesus they say now they were with us how many brother how many brothers why only seven there were seven presents meaning that they were sons they were men anybody here seven of them what happened to the seven anybody here and the first when he had married a wife disease death next and having no issue so the law still valid left his wife onto his water likewise the second also no children the laws still apply and the third onto the water and at last the woman also did water so seven brothers were unable to produce a child why seven anybody here who's going to produce a child who will produce the child let's go back to the scripture everybody okay anybody okay now amen and take her to him verse five as a wife and perform the duty of her husband brother to her everybody okay and it shall be that the firstborn when the first child is born anybody here the first one it's bible teaching my friend when the first born which it shall be that the firstborn which she bears the first child shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead the way we understand this usually is that if the brother that is passed away his name is there is no william here so let me talk with him okay let me call branham so i don't fall on somebody's families member let me call brannan anybody here his name is branham branham is dead without a child anybody here the brother take the wife and then a baby comes when the baby comes the way we in a pentecostal way denominational way the way we understand the scripture we will expect this baby to be called water which is wrong [Music] let me read the scripture again with you let's read it again what is stephen the bible say let's go quietly everybody here let's go verse six and it shall be that the first bond which she shall bear shall do what succeed water the firstborn is succeeding in not bearing everybody okay everybody okay the first i know i know i know it's a surgery i just put some anesthetic so come we're going up everybody okay he is succeeding in in the name he's entering in the name succeeding in speaking about an inheritance anybody here he's get he becomes head of the one that is dead amen amen if you got uh i don't know a thread of something put your bible keep the scripture right here let's go to genesis 38 move by your right everybody here hallelujah i don't understand the scriptures say succeeding in the name let me make it a little bit worse for you so it will help you can we go back a little bit where we were let me let's make it worse amen verse six and it shall be that the firstborn which she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead but it's even stopped in the middle of the scripture let's read it all that his name be not water pulled out of israel you see brothers even so they're saying the name now let's go to genesis 38. in genesis 38 the law is not there you remember moses is not born yet in genesis we're talking about abraham and joseph and and then the children of jacob genesis 38 we're talking about the children of judah so moses is not born yet moses will wait all the way down there but what i read to you came from the law where did moses get it genesis 38 verse one you there and it come to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned into a certain abdullah mad whose name was who ohira and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua he took her and went into her so judah married a gentile woman and she conceived and bore a son and he called his name water what is the name of the firstborn the firstborn of judah amen hallelujah jump to verse 6 now and judah took a wife for her his firstborn whose name was who so air mary temer everybody okay verse seven is coming and judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord the first husband wicked and the lord did what the lord killed him for his wickedness anybody okay praise god and judah said to onan go in your brother's what wife and marry her and raise up seed to your water where did she where did judah learn this moses was not here moses is not born yet who taught judah this law and god took the law and put it in the word of god we okay now so we found this law already existed before moses so honorary who's following the brother must take care of them let's see if he has a choice amen amen verse uh verse nine thank you and onan knew watch carefully that deceived the child should not be what so now we got some correction here so are we okay now i told you baba teaching anybody okay so the child that is born the firstborn does not belong to the one that gave birth to him anybody okay when he's born he's considered the child of the dead anybody here so according to what we read it looks like if there's a child of the dead we're worrying about his name to be put out of israel so the baby must have the name of the father anybody okay so on here understood who taught him the law moses was not there yet he understood that if this child is born he's not going to be mine he belongs to her everybody okay now praise god hallelujah he said verse 9 he knew that he should not be his and he came to pass when he went into his brother's wife that he spilled it on the ground the salmon lest that he should give seed to his water so it's clear now the baby is going to the brother so if they ask you today that brother was dead does he have a child you will call that child that that child is his child amen everybody okay and whatever that bread the head everybody here belong to that child if that brother that was dead was a millionaire this baby is born a millionaire anybody okay anybody okay so far hallelujah let's go to verse 10 and the thing which he did everybody okay please download [Music] so god was already in the law [Music] before even israel existed amen amen let me help you up again very good according to genesis 38 brother robert since the boss just dropped it to me right here we are dealing with gentile amen everybody okay so that law

wife to raise up the name of the dead are we are we going with the name remember in genesis 38 the name did not ended up being heir the name was different so getting in the name is succeeding into the

woman that is coming into your house like who and who so roof become the very birth of israel [Music] ruth you are no more a gentile the way rachel and leah was in the house of jacob that's exactly the way you are [Music] everybody okay everybody okay let's continue karma which too did build the house of water roof you become the mother of israel amen two women into one remember rachel and leah you remember in the hotel one top the gentile and one have the jews both of them in one body in roof because the church in the church ages is made out of the jews and the water rachel you become the church the bride of the gentile but you are not only genta you have leah and you have rachel remember in the hotel rachel was beautiful but leah her eyes she was led by the prophet israel was led by the prophet that's leah ever here roof you are a true brother in you we see the jews and the gentiles part together we can see paul and william branham put together in you [Applause] when we check you roof we see peter we see john we see luther we see wesley we see columba it's jews and gentiles that are mixed together everybody okay everybody okay let's continue my friend i'm good in time i am not i'm just rather it's just one scripture my friend so cool down it's your boss you ready you ready the lord makes the woman that is coming to your house like rachel and like leah which too did build the house of israel you ready and do you widely in a flutter be famous where what happened in bethlehem why leader bethlehem we want you to be strong in bethlehem [Applause] [Music] ever here that's why you need a prophet everybody here you ready you ready you have not answered me you ready look at verse 12 and let your house be like the house of who the house of who [Applause] let's go let's go back again let your house be like the house of who remember the law came from the gentile amen when a child of judah married a gentile he opened up this law now another tribe of judah is marrying a gentile a royal image the elder look they say when we put the dna we can see tema [Music] let your house be like the house of who reference tamar everybody okay let your house be like the house of faires whom temer ball to who do you remember the baby that judah head that's what's going to happen to you of seed of the seed which the lord shall give you of this young water everybody okay so boys took roof and she was with his wife roof was the wife of marlon so we expecting the baby to be called let's see so boys took roof and she was with his wife and when he went into her the lord gave her a conception and she bore a woman why they always come up son everybody okay and the women said to her bless the lord which have not left you this day without a kingsman that his name may be famous in israel anybody here jump to verse 16 and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse to it and the women her neighbor gave it a name saying there is a son born to who born to roof because they were redeeming naomi they are redeeming israel let's call him a jew jesus the jew everybody here there is a son born to naomi and they call his name wu he is the father of who the father of who why is his name not marlon but obed let's go to deuteronomy 25 hallelujah sorry brother robert that's how he goes you are sitting with me in my office now everybody okay let's go to verse five now if a brethren dwelt together and one of them died and have no child the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger you must know that when you're a woman you must understand you're right her husband brother shall go into her and take her by him as a wife and perform the duty the obligation of the husband brothers to him and it shall be that the firstborn which she bear shall succeed in it is no longer bearing the name because the child of judah never bored the name of air and the child of marlon of boaz never bought the name of marlon everybody but that's succeeding is what happened between ever and said amen amen the bible said and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and call his name water for god she said had appointed me another instead of what [Applause] they didn't give set the name of abel but seth was the replacement of abel he was in the place of evil so when you see set it's the resurrection of evil [Music] so when you see this chad this child belongs to the dead when they say who's this child you say that's the child of malone so the name of malone is now remembered through the child everybody okay so far everybody good now let's continue down that the name of his brother which is dead that his name be not pulled out of israel now you understand this and if the man like not to take his brother's wife follow me carefully the man turn around and say like the one in the roof you okay no i don't want to do it then let the brother's wife the woman go up to the gate to the elder so not only was that an obligation or a duty but he have bad consequences that the woman can apply to the men there was legal consequences legal claim for the woman everybody okay am i reading a different bible let's go now he says if the man verse 7 if the man like not to take his brother's wife then let his brother's wife go up to the gate to who and say my husband's brother refused to raise up to his brother don't say he doesn't love me don't catch him there catch him by the law by your right when you're talking you need to know which language you're using anybody here anybody here you can call jesus son of david son of david and you don't get answered yet he's god because you are approaching him with a wrong language you must know your position you must know your right and know your terminology [Music] [Applause] you must know how to pray you don't pray that pentecostal you must pray with understanding [Applause] moving by your right everybody here everybody here he says then he says my husband brother refused to raise up not he refused me we refuse to raise up his brother's name put them together bump that man against the law head front collision [Music] and let the insurance handle it everybody okay we okay it says my husband brother refused to rise up to his brothers brother and name in israel he will not perform the duty of my husband water it's an obligation then the elder of the city of his city shall call him and speak to him and if he stand to it and say i like not to take water if they call him they say hey you messing up you need to take this wife i don't want her no problem watch what happened anybody here are you ready then shall his brother's wife come to him in the presence of the elder this woman is not coming like this she's straight up in the presence of the elder she's talking to a

answer and say so shall it be done to that man that will not build up his brother's house so she spit and she talked to you this is the way they treat the people that doesn't do the law of redemption amen but here and his name they change his name his reputation his name shall be called in israel not only in bethlehem the whole israel the house of him that has his shoe why is the emphasis on the shoe loose everybody okay so far everybody good now everybody okay so far okay so far blessed be let's go to ruth chapter 3 now hallelujah [Music] moving by your right are you there roof chapter 3. if

abraham amen but here he never asked sarah genesis 18 and he took water there is a mystery with body because it comes from milk that has been curdled because the milk of the world is there and the meat but there is an intermedium level when the curd the milk a little bit to get you better let me leave it alone he took the burden a bad care and what about here and the calf which he did what and he set it before them and he stood by them under the water so when abraham brought food he brought meat and he wrote drink and abraham didn't say anything he just went and sat down because you don't

love her the boy say anything no boys by law is already your husband by law whether he like it or not by law you treat him like your husband that's it you want me to go back again to what i read before ever here and when boys laid on the floor at night what how what she had to put her confidence in poets without water no matter what anybody had to say she trusted him as a water she had to and everyone that comes to christ must do likewise you got to learn yourself at the disposal of christ no matter what mother say what dad say what anybody else say lay yourself at his what roof showed her what by laying her upon her ears why he was what you ready mama what about if you get upset you ready you ready fear shows that you don't know who you are because the law already protected you and gave you power remember on wednesday brother said preach on the jubilee that you believe what he does he give power to the slaves [Music] no matter how much he owes you no matter how much you whip him if the jubilee sounds if the clock of redemption sound don't be afraid of that master again [Music] even if you are in his property you flip [Music] you can even leave it and let it drop anybody okay feel not for that shall not be ashamed neither be that what for that shall not be put to shame for that shall forget the shame of that and shall not remember the reproach of that what when from that maker is who you always call him maker maker maker listen to me he's not just your maker the maker is your husband the boss by law by your right he's your husband and he will not marry if your problem is not solved [Music] amen the marriage of the lamb has that marriage won't happen if he has not finished my problem [Music] jesus will never come back if me i am not ready for him you don't understand i am the one blocking the rapture i have to finish my mission here before the rapture come on [Music] hallelujah for that make a eastern husband the lord of water is his name and that redeemer the holy one of water the god of the holy water why are you afraid why are you afraid why are you afraid why are you afraid the bible says blessed i did that do what he taught me to stay on the field you did it right yes he told you don't go to another field you obey yes by obeying and doing his will what does he do to you that they may have rights you don't beg the tree of life you

you full obedience entitles you empowers you to the token [Music] did i ask you to give the promise of the holy ghost why did you give it i didn't ask you you must abide by the law everybody here ever here the right to what not only that because that's the first part of redemption that gives you the redemption of the inner man but the outside is still fighting now there is a second right and that you may through the water for you to enter you must have a glorified body so it gives you right to claim your holy ghost and to claim your body change that you meant to heaven moving by your right my goodness hallelujah if you're bad and my words are bad you told me to stay in your field and your word divided me that's why i stood in the field so you shall do it he told you to stay you did that go

[Music] hallelujah you take him by his word you take him by his promise you take him by what he told you it is no longer a christful prayer that woman was not crying the roman chantillion was not crying roof was not crying tema was not crying they knew they're right [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the sarah phoenician at the beginning did not know her right but because she was persistent but here god gave very revelation that don't call him like that since you want what you want and this is your child in trouble and you want to get your healing flip the language everybody here flip the language when you flip the language you're going to be in offense and before he tells you he will admire you you the most gracious woman you're a virtuous woman i've never seen such a big faith in israel i never seen no no no it's not a bad admiring give me what i want before he give you i never seen such faith in israel can you imagine such faith in israel that it's a it's a weakness that you already got him when he begin to praise he means that he already down [Music] did you get me when you hear borah saying you are a virtuous woman he's already down when you hear jesus saying i never seen such a faith he's already doomed [Music] woman because of your faith that you say it's already finished the word already caught him [Music] because he was trying to kick the woman out [Music] but here but the woman already claimed lord so there is no way she can be kicked out anymore he jesus should have kicked her out when she said david that's right but here only gentle come with such a faith as that you move in to god not as a beggar hallelujah let me skip this one let me see brother branham said this that boasts look upon her since she was a virtuous woman he said that surely must have been water she already completed that stage amen what is going on he said and what did she answer back but you are a near skins man da at a near kinsmen you can do for me you can put me to rest i have come here and laid here not for an immoral woman i have led here not to be a sheriff off to show to people i can speak with tom show people i can dance in the spirit show people i can shout but i have come here because you are not to show that i could do something big but you are my water i have come because you are here you are the only one that can do it see the attitude the convert to christ to the church there are the virtuous woman i am a new york kinsman and now cover yourself lie down until water just cover up in the blanket i am your kinfolk lay down till the water but here because i'm laying at your feet if you don't do anything you're going to be in trouble i have a right to spit on your face [Music] i have a right to do it in front of the elder and pull your shoe but this husband you don't pull your shoe off of him because john the baptist said i john the baptist baptize you with what but there is another one that is coming who's what you cannot he's responsible you cannot take his shoe off [Applause] you cannot take his shoe off he will not he will not lose his glory [Applause] [Music] that man when he comes to his glory he can give everything [Applause] ever here if what you need will disgrace him he will give it to you because he loves his glory he cannot share it with nobody nobody cannot lose his shoe he will baptize you with them because no one can it's a guarantee he's a responsible man [Music] whatever he does he will protect his honor [Applause] everybody here in other words jesus will protect his honor because of you he should you cannot remove he will not accept to be disgraced if it's about his promise you catch him by his promise because of his honor he have to honor his promise it's a guaranteed deal i john baptize you with water but another one is coming who's i am not worthy to he will baptize you with the the losing of the shoe is followed by the holy ghost but here he will not tolerate to be disgraced in front of the elder because he wants all the elder to sing unto him glory to the lamb who else who has no beginning no end who is ready to take the book to break the seal he won't lose that honor he won't lose that place therefore your redemption is guaranteed [Applause] my god every promise in this book if you know who you are it is guaranteed [Applause] let me finish by this let me stop by this even moses when god got angry at israel and god was about to destroy israel do you know where moses got him he said wait let me remind you you see all this nation they will mock you they will say you brought them out of egypt to kill them you are not powerful when god heard that he forget the sin of israel calling yesterday any answer bring the atonement those people cannot gossip about me i must show that i'm powerful his shoe you cannot remove him that's where you get him [Applause] right back here so when you talk to him when you talk to him you say listen you see the way i am if you leave me like this i'm gonna be a disgrace they know that i believe the message you must change me so i'm a true message believer [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah tell him tell him do you see how much they are attacking the message you see how much the gospel by the message somebody must be a witness me i'm a witness if you don't help me the shame will go to you ah you already vindicated the message so you better do your work on me you better work on me you better give me what i want before i take your shoe but no one will take his shoe away you're gonna be covered let's stand [Applause] [Music] you are moving by your right you are approaching god by your right where did that stop oh my god i can't move forward amen you must know who you are teaching is important to positionally who you are when they say
