what i thought so sister zarik god bless you amen god bless you saints um as you heard that prayer request for um sister cost is one of my friends from a long time um just to hear her crying over the phone and so much pain and agony was quite disturbing you know sometimes people go through things you you don't you're not able to relate until you hear them at their worst we going on with our lives and you you forget that there's other people who are in need and so it's a humbling experience um this is a song um you know with how service has been going a song that i actually had on my heart about three weeks ago and um it's funny as soon as i heard her voice there's a song that dropped into my head um and i don't know if she's watching i don't know if he sent her the link but i'm gonna sing this in honor of the lord but for her as a testimony for her healing i pray this to be a blessing i love the lord he heard my cry and pitied her [Music] grown long as i leave [Music] and troubles [Music] to your throne oh i love i love the [Music] [Music] [Laughter] long as i i leave and troubles come your throne amen thank you lord praise the lord jesus amen we just want to stand at this time as we were to change the order of the service and call the pastor to invite to uh introduce the minister tonight we want to sing um 400 because he lives i can face tomorrow [Music] amen but [Music] we have such a confidence in god's word the lord has been opening his word to us so much lately and um just seeing what is already written that cannot be altered it cannot be changed even though the skeptics were howling their mouths will be shot because it's written and nobody could change it that is a wonderful amen amen and just so because he lives we live also amen this first one because he lives tomorrow [Applause] i can face [Music] is [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] and life is [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah our fear is gone [Music] and because i know [Music] yes my future [Music] and life is just [Music] because jesus lives amen praise the name of the lord father michael good to see you and sister tracy always welcome home amen amen blessed be the name of the lord how many enjoy the service last week amen blessed be the name of the lord tonight i'm not preaching we have one of our local ministers who will be preaching for us tonight but i just want to mention i know i've seen a lot of folks online streaming if you would brother david probably will remind it to the church you can read this day one and it's the chapter two amen just focus on one and two a book keep opening opening opening opening it seems like i don't know when we're gonna leave western go back to the mystery of the two steps amen so just remember esther chapter one we already dealt with the first feast of king ahazarys we dealt with the second one now we need to get to the third fist so to prepare to the third fish you need esther one and that's the chapter two you focus on them and those who can in the church age book you start having homeworks now amen in the church age book you can get this online it's for free in the age of sardisian churches the fifa there is a section where brother branham handled the promise to the overcomer i didn't say read the whole churches if you can read it that's fine but that section deal with i will not blot his name out of the book of life just that section if you have a time you can read just that section you need it for esther chapter 2 because the book of life opened up in esther chapter 2. i'm not gonna preach it the whole book but we need to touch it but if you get the book of life from the sardisian church age it's gonna be easy for you to travel on sunday without any problem so once we get to the mystery of predestination then we can preach the book of life then it's going to be clear and you're going to appreciate god more and more in your life for god having chosen you before the foundation of the world it's gonna bring you more closer to god never like before because you're gonna see where you're coming from and what you could have been if it was not for the choosing and the grace of god and even when he came he chose judah [Music] but judah had to be let go because according to the progress the program of god judah was not there so esther chapter one esther chapter two the sardisian church age the section that say the promise to the overcomer brother problem is dealing with blooding the name out of the book of life you can read just that section then when we get to esther chapter 2 the book of life will open with the second feast we have brother kelly tonight he's one of the veterans so he will be ministering for us you know brother kelly there's not much i can talk he's there helping us a lot and even standing on the back trying to help for the grace of god so you pull on the gift of the lord and rather kelly you can have your liberty tonight this is home preach like home amen because he lived [Music] hallelujah [Music] tomorrow [Music] uh [Music] me [Music] i tell you such a presence in here tonight but mike if i was knowing you would say i'd take this tire off and give it to you huh that's okay brother steve will get you another time amen it's an honor always to come into the house of the lord and brother steve said you know it's a surprise for me also you know you don't know how god does things you know we're coming out that the lord is richly blessing us here those that are online and haven't been following how the lord's been opened up the scriptures is i tell you it's just richly a blessing to each and every one of us you know i tell you when you get there and you get behind a ministry like that you can't do nothing but up he makes you dig you know he makes you get into the end time message that's for by god's grace and you know it's just always a blessing i'll tell you so of all hearts and minds are clear we won't prolong the time i'm normally like brother steve said on wednesday normally i'll try to get by that back door you know and and just do and be a help as much as i can but i guess the lot is fell on me tonight is that right so that means the devil is in trouble okay he know he's in trouble you know because it's just a word that god has given us this hour here now is that right when the holy ghost is coming this hour here now when the when the what the cerebral messenger is that right has come in his hour here now huh the devil know he's in trouble because god is unfolding his word for us for a purpose is that right god just doesn't do things for no reason at all he's preparing us for something to come i don't want to get ahead okay also all y'all out there that was looking for some um um what are the snappers tonight right you know how you catch red snappers you know after brother stephen when he'd been going into the deep the lord been allowed to go into the deep is that right but we're just gonna eat some brim and crappy tonight okay but it's still fish and it's still the same holy ghost is that right hallelujah let us pray and let us bow let us go before the lord lord god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you lord god for an opportunity to come before lord god your precious children lord god we look unto the heel to where our help and our strength coming from lord god is such a reverence in here lord god on tonight because father i know you won't let him down and i know you won't let me down lord god because you said with two or three were gathered in thy name that you would be in the midst of us so lord god we want you to have your way lord jesus those lord god let your spirits move let your gifts move lord god among your precious children lord god let them you set where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty so father we open the doors to you lord god we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory we bind of every demon force in the name of jesus christ and that will try to trouble the hearts and the mind of your children so we look into the hill have your way and by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen you know on tonight while you're standing you can turn to psalms go to psalms 33 i'll tell you it's just uh it's a blessing i said lord it's amazing how you do things i said lord my precious brother i looked at him when he came out the door suddenly there and i said lord strengthening strengthen our pastor i said lord there's some don't understand you know it's a different anointing when you're up under here and then when you leave it it takes your toll i think brother branham said what 30 minutes of preaching was like eight hours of work i think he said so we have to realize you you know you're getting yourself out of the way especially when you have a precious group like this that love the word of god you know when you're just poor and you're just poor so he won't let you down tonight he said look here once once you have it say amen let's look at the psalms 33 and let's look at verse 16 we look at verse 16 through 22. he says there is no king saved by the multitude of and hosts a mighty man is not is not delivered by much strength he says and a horse is vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his strength in other words there's no salvation in nothing but the lord jesus christ nothing but him he said now he says to deliver their soul he said beho behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope is is in his what mercy it says to deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in the famine oh we got a word in here tonight you don't have to worry about the virus huh he says our soul waited for the lord he is our help and our shield he said for our heart shall rejoice in him because he have to because we have trusted in his what holy name let thy mercy o lord be upon us according as we hope in thee in psalms 106. and uh we'll just read two verses out of here when she said have it say amen psalms 106 and so seven and eight our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remember not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the red sea nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to the name may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know here on tonight i tell you i just i thought i really couldn't change the title because it was such it was so good you know brother branham um minister a message uh misunderstood misunderstanding god a misunderstood god is that right so we're going to look at that here on tonight you know right there before that message it was something because he had a question and answers and then the question and answered you know at that time even most of them was it was linked towards the gifts and things that were operating in the church and they had questions but you know it was he thought he didn't have many uh questions so he just had two somebody so he went and studied and he looked at this thought but i believe this thought was burning on his heart because he still asked the congregation to give him grace to preach this thought so we want to read here and look what he said he says uh verse he said the lord were now now we're turned into psalms we read the psalms he said our fathers understood not the wonders in egypt they remember not the multitudes of thy mercy he said but provoked him even at the red sea see now we notice we're going to look because you help us tonight because we want to bring it up to our day by the grace of god you know it was always through every age they always misunderstood god they misunderstood the spirit of god they misunderstood the people of god through every age you know so we have to understand we're our balls is that right it's no different we're peculiar people but we're of what we're the royal blood we are the royal family we are the royal priesthood we're talking about something okay we're in this at night this is the age okay you know where the lord has the pastor at because he's preparing you for something you know i don't want to get ahead of myself but we want you to understand now we're moving to a higher level is that right god is preparing you for something but he's got to build a character in you so you can handle what he's got for you is that right let us look misunderstood it says it is to stand is to understand wrongly to misinterpret it the prophet told us don't misinterpret the scriptures is that right it's trouble okay you can throw people off they're relying on the salvation from here is that right the words that come from here is because why this is the throne of god a pulpit is the throne of god it's the mount peace of god and where the word of god comes from is that right he said now misunderstood it's not comprehended it's wrongly interpreted it's not appreciated at the truth is that right so it's so when the lord talked about that sunday is that right people some people are not really desiring and hungering for the truth is that right because why it has to be a sea in you that god put there before the foundation of the world is that right first we were an attribute an attribute is a thought is that right that's why when you come into the house of the lord if you know the house of the lord you've got to be spiritually enlightened you've got to be prayed up you've got to catch what the holy spirit is doing in the air is that right that's why god is building a house god is building this house it's a spiritual house that god is building is that right the lord showed us their son you had cain he had abel is that right what have religion what had salvation is that right we're going to show you in the scripture reading this message his two spirits is that right but it's going to be so close it's going to deceive the very last but it won't deceive the very leg why because god had promises and we're holding on to the promise of god but i'm telling you there's some things out there that's real close and you're making you make to make you think it's just say the lord hallelujah i got a whole lot in here tonight but i'm just going to let him have his way is that right huh say what brother yeah i gotta have it wait see this and this i tell you i got time you know why i got time because god's given me grace now i worked 14 years on one job i worked 14 years on another job my wife waited 36 years sleeping late at night and i just retired last week i worked 23 years on that job the devil's in trouble now i can do the work for the lord i'm giving him the glory he kept me he watched over me he kept me in good health now he's in trouble huh the war is on now huh oh what do you say brother steve is in the message the message is in the fight [Applause] oh hallelujah when you got time look what he said let's look and see what the prophet said okay he says now he said now our fathers understood not the wonders in egypt they remembered nothing the multitudes of thy mercies they provoked him at the sea he said now he said now the lord added his blessings now look in here and see what the prophet says he said now i'm going to speak to you if the lord willing on the subject of being god being misunderstood he said i'll tell you i'll take it like that god being misunderstood he said you know misunderstanding gets us in a lot of trouble you know you know when i supervise people when i was on my job that's what i was telling them i said miss you got understanding and understanding that's why you've heard me say when understanding comes confidence comes confidence comes faith come faith is a revelation that only god can give it to you is that right so when we get around and i said tell myself mr glenn and he said i understand and you know it took me seven years and i was getting ready to leave to tell this one fella you know what oh was he a challenge but you know what i should get her in and teller finally we got these new machines and we got these new machines and their machines is under gps so some of y'all probably winning walmart seeing these scrubbers run around the store and buy them by themselves now whether they go controlled by the gps and you know i would tell the fellow there go put this get this started over this here at a certain time if you don't get it at a certain time then you're going to have to reroute the valve but technology is moving so moving so fast now you know if you don't run that machine certain times so many hours it's connected directly to corporate is that right and so corporate is monitoring everything so now but this machine replaces three workers so now i don't know what their thinking is but you know we gotta watch the machine so not only replace three people but it also supposed to do the job of these three people but anyway i was telling the gentleman he had to start at a certain time and they get around him so he didn't start a couple times he didn't do it i said you didn't start the machine he said yeah but i understand i said no you don't [Applause] i said i said you just has an intellectual conception of what i told you i said but if you had understanding it would be in performance and you were moving to it is that right now we're getting somewhere you want to see how it is in this message some got an intellectual conception and some are spiritual some are cardinal and some are fleshly minded and that's where it's going to come the battle is on is that right oh it's going to be showdown is that right because god when he send the word signs and wonders follow it is that right then now we have a brother come up here and say that the lord delivered him from a migraine headache is that right then not the pastor prayed for him but he know it wasn't him it was christ demonstrating that he's on the scene is that right all you got to do is speaking and stand on the word that god has given up in this hour here now i don't want to get ahead of myself because i tell you i want to blast the devil tonight okay i've been waiting for this is that right some of them don't know what's going on they might have the election out here but you know what we got it right in here tonight is that right the holy ghost is that right he has his selection that he wants to minister to he said now look he said god being misunderstood you know misunderstanding gets a lot of us in trouble many times that people say things that they repeat after somebody else where they misunderstood them he said is that right he said now that's what the holy ghost is doing in here ah i don't want to get ahead of myself it's things that people have said and been told and now instead of willing to say god had mercy upon me i recognize lord you're sharing something with us now that's opening up maybe i need to go back and correct lord and maybe i need to get this straightened out is that right huh let me brother brown who said you're shooting a gun and you just missed that bullseye is that right but i just missed that bullseye the father i walk away they see i don't get it corrected and then it becomes a mess is that right that's what has happened the message has become the message yes he said now look he said now i believe he said that person he said that gets a person in trouble i i believe he said don't you think so he says i know it would be for me a very good for me to find out first and then say it is that right you know what i used to tell the people i supervise i said think twice and speak once lord someone was glad to get rid of me but you know what they got trouble you know why because you can't work for a christian who can you work for he said but we're always seemed to be misunderstood he said now and and david david is speaking of israel misunderstood that the miracles when they were in egypt now to misunderstand is just to say listen to this now you see why when the holy ghost drop down in here you're saying that they seem like the pastor is being hard but when you got a pastor you got that kind of ministry that teaching ministry also it's cutting it's straight to the point you got to cut the fat off this is the hour now you got to stand strong on the word what god have given this ain't no time to be worried wondering who's this right wonder if that's right we're gonna see about the sign we're gonna see about the signal is that right hallelujah boy i'm still fired up about the rupa huh trouble with the rest of these messages is that right huh ain't too many people could go in the scriptures and unfold the whoopable come on you got to realize that he said now look this god is in this place no man can't minister like that huh his god in here [Applause] [Music] look what he said i got a lot of reading i better keep going he said i get around hallelujah he said now listen to this he said now to misunderstand is just not to say he said well i didn't hear what he said he said but to see something done and misunderstand what it's for what is the purpose of it why is god doing what he's doing [Applause] [Music] god is not like man you're coming in i love what the brother said he said we'll be all the miracles the miracles here look in the mirror he's sitting there it's more mountain too is that right i was supposed to go down there and minister down to the shelter but they haven't opened the shelter back up yet but when my wife and i went down there through the shelter because of this virus they got tents all over the place some of y'all wrote by then seen them they said tents people sleeping outside in tents 2020 in the city of charlotte one of the fastest growing cities in america same people that are that i go down there minister to i said god have mercy on them lord they need a way to get this word lord in his hour here and there he said now look he said i would didn't hear what he said he said but to see something done and misunderstand what it's for listen what he said for his heart he said that you're missing the boat all completely then ah remember his message remember his office remember what he was sent for the tie in the loose sense ring speak judgment on the land and set what his bride getting her ready dressing her with a word that god you could come to dresser so he can get ready for the wedding supper to get out of here he said now look him we can look over there and saw the ones that tell you what we're going to turn some scriptures we're moving good my god my god turn the uh uh uh acts 8. i may not get a chance to re read it all but we're going to read what the lord bring to us see what happens we know in that after out here in here in the book of acts chapter 8 we know that the jessica finish was stoning persecuting stephen is that right and he said now but at the time of they were driven out of their of jerusalem is that right he said but god was allowing this to happen for for a purpose he said now and when he would allow this to happen for a purpose and saul came and drove and and was making havoc they're destroying the church you're covering it but you had a predestinated seeds is that right he said now look for the sake of time hallelujah the scripture he said then philip went down to samaritan he says and and i'm at verse five i'm sorry eight and five he said then philip went down the city of samara and and and preached christ unto them he says now and the people one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for what unclean spirits crying with the loud void they recognize the presence of the holy ghost some people don't you let the devil trouble your mind but the lord but the pastor called it last time i wanted to preach earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints the last time we hear but god caught and he recognized it was a sinner that was in here god knew someone needed to hear the gospel so god's changed it but you got to be yielding to be able to get out of your mind and to get into his mind get yourself out of the way and take the leading of the holy ghost is that right because he promised to lead and guide you into all truth is that right look what he said he said not anything and the unclean spirits cried with a loud voice came out of the many that would possess who posses possessed with them and many take with pauses and take william where what we're healed and there was great what now we're talking about it was great joy in the city but see when them brothers came in there but they misunderstood their ministries is that right so saul he didn't understand at the time that saul didn't realize that god was using him to push the saints forward is that right the saints went to scatter but it just didn't go and scatter and sit down when the saints went to scatter they went to preaching the gospel brother mike they went around and then telling them about the goodness of the lord is that right he begins now thy mercy that's what paul said paul said i beseech you my

tell them show me any prophet in the scriptures that forfeit this age i said he had three names perfection that all of them had seven letters in it huh completion hallelujah look at this ministry watching hallelujah look what he said i'm still in psalms 103. he says forget not and who forgive us all thy what and heal of all thy what ah somebody coming here with an illness tonight take the word

dr jesus is that right hallelujah hallelujah we're gonna preach one day if the lord gave me grace see you can't preach anything until god opened it up that's what gets you in trouble that's what gets so many people in trouble he got away i told him i didn't know what i was going to minister i had to wait on him is that right but somewhere you know how you deal with you each and every one of them know how god you know how god deals with you let me keep moving hallelujah psalms 103 he said who forget all thy iniquities who he'll evolve like what some diseases some diseases [Music] i'm going to read something to you you got to say from a prophet i can tell you why they got problems out there i can tell you why they they ain't got the the miracle because there's so much unbelief in these poop pets you drive around you see and when you sin you say my god my god you got to catch the mind of god you have to get in the spirit it's something something in this message that they don't fully believe is that right huh god honors faith god god does not send someone out unless they got a fake seed inside of them because god will not be mocked [Applause] that's why if i come here in any name other than the name of the lord i better be careful the burden is not brother steve's uh the burden of god is that right when he brought us out of egypt when he saw what we were going to be before the foundation of the world he said i'm the lord thy god that he'll all thy disease listen to this here brother branham talks about the plagues he said guys provide a way of healing chicago he said let me pass something here quickly as our time is going listen did you know that the bible predicts that in the last days that there will be a german war that disease will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the what baptism of the holy ghost he says he said now look but with but with the angel or who or or out well let me back up these diseases will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the holy spirit but with the angel or who had charged over these plagues was given orders i'm rather steve a commandment he was given an order he came from the throne of god touch no one whom the mark was why how much kind of teachers have we got to be brethren we got to do what we got to get the church in order to be in that condition now you see what i say to pooping now you see what god is bringing us up to god is bringing us into something we thank god for luther we thank god for wesley we thank god for justification thank god for sanctification we know when a sinner come here god is teaching us about this gospel you can't get away from the gospel that's what it was remember brother branham also said from genesis to malachi he said it was two things every prophet touched on he was saying it was the coming of the messiah and he said the atonement the plan of redemption isn't that what we're bringing you into a knowledge of who you really are the prophet god said when they come into the knowledge of who they really are they would be an invincible army [Music] you got to do you know why because you can't say that now you got to come up

boasting in jesus christ i'm voting in god i'm boasting in the word of god this is the age if the rapture is about to take place then when are these children going to see it so they are lymphatic god or powerful god i'm the present god god that knows everything look what he said god provided the prophet this one here he says it again over here in phoenix he said god provided a prophet with the vindicated original word he said he says moses is that right he says they wanted the army to rise up and to take them out and beat the egyptians down but god sent them what the words ah the prophet with the vindicated words that god had spoken before to abraham saying thy she shall sojourn in a strange land but i would visit them with a mighty hand the word that god had spoke they was crying for

buying disinfecting the store for four dollars and selling it for 10. this in fact tell me this ain't a vindicator ah and put some visceral effect on it now i'm not knocking this in fact now don't get me wrong we're talking about the hero we comparing them with the healer wisdom comes from god as the holy spirit ministers sunday god i'm not knocking doctors i'm not knocking hospitals i'm not knocking equipment i'm not knocking medicine but come on brian we got to come on up here though is that right [Applause] he said but it didn't do a bit of good god made a provided way ah [Applause] i can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of jesus and the blood today is the what the holy ghost is that right that life is in the blood he says god provided as simple as it seems to take the blood of a lamb and sprinkle it on the door yeah god said he said that was his way and he honored it all out from under the blood what dies that's the first one he told him how you going to make it without the baptism of the holy ghost jesus said let not your heart be troubled you believe in god you're believing me also in my father's house there are many manchester if it was not so i would have told you so he said but i would go away and do what and prepare a place for you don't let the baptist steal that scriptures from you that's a rapturing scripture ah we got scriptures that's in there for the bride as i go away and prepare a place for you but he said i knew what he said but i'm gonna give you what a comforter is that right the comfort of the comforter which is the holy ghost is that right it will lead you it will guide you it will protect you it's your comforter it's your fortress it's your buckler he's your teacher huh lean not to your own understanding but trust in the lord in all his way trust in god by the way i will lead you and guide you into what all truth that's what he said oh boy let me my god my god let me look we have to jump a little bit he said now look look why the lord is the ministry that he sent us turn to matthew 24. hallelujah the resurrected christ is on the scene he's not dead but he's alive is that right and whatever you need for getting not all thy benefits you go home you can finish looking at um 23. he said look what we have for the sake of time i'm going to have to jump here just a little bit he says now now look hallelujah i'm sorry it was the 24th i think i wrote the wrong one down hallelujah looking forward okay i think i wrote it down wrong i'm looking here for the okay the resurrection event i think it was luke i want the event in luke yeah hallelujah just bear with me for just a minute i think i gotta read here yeah it was luke 24. thank you jesus hallelujah don't you have it say amen okay i'll catch up so we're going to jump a little bit let's look at verse 13. let me come around in verse 13. now we know here this is right after the resurrection but we're showing how even those disciples and even the uh some of the apostles they can clearly even have understanding when god is moving he's brought this ministry here for a purpose remember the prophet that god said but you got to know why god is doing what he's doing he says now look in verse 13 he said behold two of them now i'm going to speed up okay my yankee english is getting ready to come out he says now behold two of them went down same day into the village of came emails and which was from jerusalem about three scores four long and they talked together of all these things which had which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reason jesus himself drew near and and went with them he says but there was their eyes will hold that they should not what know him see he says and he and and he said now remember we're talking about understanding misunderstanding god he had people that be right there and sitting and walk with him and still didn't have the revelation of who he was he said people are sitting now in this day and time in this message and don't even realize who he is is that right that's why you've heard me say if you go over the second you can't have time to turn this if you go to second kings two write it down and go home there and read it when you go over to second kings two and you recognize it was the sons of god and it was the sons of the prophet is that right elisha he was keeping his eye on elijah is that right but he wasn't watching just elijah he was watching the spirit that was on elijah and when he coming in and watching the spirit that was on elijah he knew that he was about to leave and when they told him not to know that he was about to leave he said i know hold your peace side is that right when he come around in there he wasn't watching him he watched what god how god had vindicated him he watched the ministry that god had given him is that right he didn't we wasn't going to miss that double portion is that right hallelujah 50 sons of the prophet stand by sons of the prophets in this message brother mike intellect intellect that's why i said understand and understanding where's their performance huh but there's a performance it has to be a performance when understanding comes that right paul said you know you know them that their faith by their works james says you know their faith their works demonstrate their faith is that right they were then paul was looking at what god said james was looking at what man said is that right they were not contradicting it so you had to understand is that right but paul still didn't have what we have is that right we got zerubbabel mekomon hallelujah look what he says he says now but that i was on verse 17 i'm in luke 24 17 and he said unto them what manner of communication are these that ye have one to another as you walk and or what sadder some of you come in here huh sitting down you had a long day i know you had a long day but all you got to do is get in the presence of the lord huh when you get in the presence of the lord i say there's nothing like the presence of the lord i said it's nothing like the presence of the lord i said and we seek his face cause he's here in this place and it's nothing like the presence of the lord huh why is salvation in the presence of huh the lord a headache so there's healing in the presence of the lord oh you got a sickness i said it's healing in the presence of the lord jehovah raphae's presence i say you seek is his face he is here in this place and it's nothing like the presence of the lord i'ma make you jealous homeline streamers you know what because it's nothing like the presence ah [Applause] he said look what he said hallelujah look what he says why are you

christ never fail me yet why you got salvation he saved my soul one day he saved my soul one day come on saints the glory of the lord the joy of the lord is our strength the joy of the lord is our sins the joy of the lord [Music] he says and one of them whose name was cleophas verse 18 answering and said unto him are thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not those things which have come to pass he says written in these days he said he said unto them what things they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed in word before god and all the people has already seen him as a prophet he says then how the chief priest and all the rulers delivered him to condemn him to death but we trust that he had been he who he which should have should have redeemed israel and besides all this and to this day is the third day since since he we're done since these things were done yay and a certain woman also of our company made an astonish see an astonish with where early at the supper and when they found out his body they came saying that that they had also seen a vision of angels and said that he was what alive and certain what are they looking for now and looking for the testimony we're the brother that got healed from the headache last week that's why when brother abel and him ask you for your testimony tell them your testimony one day we're going to preach you and show you how god get his reputation how jesus christ get his reputation how he's come in here he did not come for his own he said i'll do nothing except the father show me he said i do what's pleasing for the father hallelujah that leave that alone that's another message help me lord he said now look we're going to jump a little bit for the spirit to take the time in verse 25 he says then he then he said unto them old fools and slow heart to believe all that the what prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and what he beginning and moses and all the prophets he expounded in all this getting all the what all the what ah what the pastor say we're gonna back it by the scripture is that right he can't move the word don't worry about your testimony understand you come tell it lift up the name of the lord jesus christ with the testimony of lazarus the devil wanted to destroy lazarus lazarus was the testimony but he could not touch the testimony because the word was written in word was backing up the testimony hallelujah he says what what else the holy ghost tell us sunday he said where the carcass is that's where the eagles we gather whether we learn wherever christ is the caucus is jesus christ hallelujah has he walked along the way he opened up the scripture [Applause] can no man do that that's guarding on this jesus christ was in this myth [Music] nobody says help me lord he said they could he said then they could still open up all the how many of the scriptures all the scriptures we're getting all of it saints this is the rub huh he's got the segment he's got the ring you know in the old testament when they made a law or made a decree once he was there that's right brother robert then they took that thing they took some clay and after they took that clay and they put it at the bottom of it and then he took that signal and he put it down there he filled it malachi 4 message is filling it all right now [Applause] look what he says thank you jesus he said now but verse 20 verse uh 28 and they drew no let me back up i missed something unto them all the scriptures the things concerning who prophet of god said you don't see jesus christ in it he said go back and look it again hallelujah he said now look he said now they constrained him [Music] okay he said 28 and they drew nigh into the village whether they went and he made as though he would what have further gone but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is towards evening and the day is far spent and he went to tarry with them and it came to pass and sat at me when they went he took what and then what and they were and gave it to them and there was the we're opening hallelujah they remember when he fed the four thousand and a five thousand jesus brought it back to their remembrance and remember when he gave it to them so they can recognize the supernatural where it be all the miracles they gotta recognize the supernatural where is it in his messages huh is there no bomb in gilead he said look what he says he broke it the breath he said and he blessed it he said in their eyes we're open and they were they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he was talked with us along the way he said my god my god hallelujah can you give me five minutes he said he talked to us along the way why he opened while he opened us the what why are god why is god doing this why does god now have this ministry why did this precious brother wait and be faithful as a deacon hidden and being faithful in his position recognizing being faithful to his shepherd being faithful to the pastor well being humble staying in his face he was

first queen that was mentioned is that right queen vesta beauty they want to show their beauty is that right two queens two women's they're on the scene each one of them wanna undermine that side jezebel means she was a worshiper of a balaam is that right idolatry they want to bring them some kind of foolishness into the message and they want to make it look like it's wrong but you know what god shall not be mocked god has a ministry here that's opening up the scriptures so that your understanding won't be mocked you don't have to worry about anything this word failing you is that right because this is the infallibility word of god now being on the scene what is he moving y'all into i didn't even touch what i wanted to preach but what is he bringing us into he's bringing us into

flavor of what is coming up on friday on sunday lord's willing praise the name of the lord he even touched the book of life he even spoke about three categories but there is four when you read it this is a masterpiece who put this picture brought in that where did you get it that's beautiful if we can keep this picture that would be great that's where we want to be soaring there amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah there is a purpose for the ministry here when the same ministry you see many brothers coming up so it's not one ministry it's a far-flu ministry that the brothers that are coming the brother here everybody else there is a purpose god wants to bring us somewhere and that's somewhere it's over there until we can speak the word and things happen amen i'm preaching things i've never seen before they keep opening up the four keys of the third polynesia i never seen that before and things keep opening up opening up god is doing that for a purpose not just to say wow no amen i spoke about ken and abel here on sunday do you remember that and i was saying that ken was working on the things that were cursed he was telling the ground then abel was working he was keeper of the ship and that's what jehovah used to clothe them so one was specializing himself on what god used and the other one what was cursed by god and someone took the sermon and sent to a minister i didn't know and the minister was trying to preach on cain and abel and their identification by the work and when he opened the sermon he fell right on it he sent me a text he said i'm i talk to him and say i'm stirred up it's like that was a confirmation to him it is not me it is a broad thing all over the world it is connected here how can i say something here and somebody else is catching it up there it is a universal bride god is working it's home going time we need to get very close to god because we gotta go amen our eyes are not in politics my eyes is in the third pool amen whatever happened there i we have the devil answer amen that's not our hope amen we're looking into christ it is time to leave this world as much as we love our car as much as we love our home as much as we love our church as much as we love our country one of this day we're going to live here and we'll go to our true country our true home our future home that's where we belong and that home has been calling for the brother amen that's why you filled the pool amen so keep yourself consecrating we already talk to you about the sovereignty of god how to break into the sovereignty of god by meditating by getting close to god that's how brother branham break into speaking to the square are you there so break into stay in tune with god stay prayed up praying doesn't mean you have to be at home just kneeling down you might be on your couch praying you might be driving praying you might be working praying you might be at work but your mind is constantly meditating upon the word of god those who do that suddenly you're gonna break into the sovereignty of god and before you know it things begin to pop up amen i wrote on my bible on sunday to show that memo can't have seven letters amen because carcass was a part of the constellation of seven chamberlain the last one was carcass which was the seventh cell the angel but when he comes down there is seven princes that sees the presence of god and i even wrote because the bible said that those priests are first in the kingdom you remember that that's the reason why in the sixth dimension when brother branham went there he was elevated on the throne because he's one of the seven princes it's memocan who have to speak he have seven letters i left it alone i watch online and sister rosemary recorded she said seven letters amen i'm like praise the name of the lord it's on the preacher it's on the sister it's on the brother it's all over the brother amen blessed be the name of the lord brother david sent me a text he said you know what carcass means it means the covering of the lamb i have it for sunday amen how can that perfectly match the last chamberlain that was sent from the presence of the king was carcass which was the covering of the lamb and i'm gonna show you a quote where brother branham said the cloud was the covering of the lamb amen and do you know what mehmukhan means impoverished certain to prepare true do you see why brother branham have to be born in a poor family and then he has to prepare with a certain and a true message i didn't put the book of esther it's all over the scripture let the devil come again and try to shake somebody from the message amen you want to challenge brother pranam let's go to the scripture amen you don't understand the cloud let's go to the scripture the cloud is in the scripture amen praise the name of the lord so just remember esther chapter one esther chapter two and then if you have a chance the sardisian church the promise to the overcomer just test the book of life and also pray for the service let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for speaking to us again mightily father
