hallelujah you believe it tonight blessed be the name of the lord it's good to be in the house of the lord and to see everybody back safe everybody that travel it looks like all the tribes are back in order [Laughter] amen yeah we appreciate the lord's grace and travel mercy he kept everybody and we back again as a family so we trust that everybody have a wonderful thanksgiving with their family spend some time eight up to the level amen blessed be the name of the lord without taking so much time let's go straight to the scripture it's wednesday so i don't know how we're going to fly we appreciate the musician god richly bless you can you hear me well okay you need to keep your bible because this thing keeps unfolding i don't know what to do amen genesis chapter 14 keep on folding unfolding unfolding somebody must be doing a lot of prayer hallelujah i believe everybody is on board with the sermon hope nobody is behind everybody's on board from sunday okay if you have not listened to sunday you're in trouble amen genesis chapter 15 verse chapter 14 verse 18. if you dare you can say amen okay and who i know brother kalim is online so somebody need to preach with me and melchizedek okay that's what i like that one can blast the devil pretty good and melchizedek king of salem you might be seated there is a man called melchizedek melchizedek because in the new testament they use an s instead of a z if you study the word you will understand those things and melchizedek king of selling brought forth bread and wine this man here is a king remember sunday right and as a king he brought bread and wine where did he fund it he brought bread and wine and he was the priest amen amen if they say deep priest how many priests do we have i love this church so it looks like there is only one priest here and he is the priest not a priest but the priest the only one the priest of who the priest of moses the priest of the most high god so god remember we got two tabernacle right we got a tabernacle in heaven which is the true tabernacle the original one or the perfect tabernacle remember the scripture on sunday and we have a tabernacle on the earth and the earth one is too many stories everybody so in heaven we found out on sunday that we had a priesthood which were the seraphim so if we got a priesthood there there must be somebody who's on top of those priesthood everybody and we found now a man called melchizedek who is deep priest in other words the highest order in heaven in the priesthood because there is a priesthood on the earth through moses aaron and then there is a priesthood in heaven so the highest order of the priesthood in heaven his name is melchizedek he is the priest of the most high god so when we look at the scripture just the way we read it it looks like we have god and we have a priest the way we read the scripture here not here yet here it looks like god has a priest and the priest of god is called melchizedek it looks like there is a god and there is a priest that's the way you look if you read the scripture there is a heaven god is in heaven and god has a priesthood in heaven he taught moses to duplicate the priesthood on the earth so in heaven the priest of heaven is called melchizedek he is the priest of the most high it looks like god and melchizedek are different looks like it if this is giving you trouble you let me know i switched to the bazooka everybody here verse 19 and he blessed him and said bless be abraham abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth so when melchizedek is talking it seems like he's getting messages from somebody or he's a messenger from someone he's talking to abraham like the most high god sent me to bless you that's the way he looks anybody verse 20 and blessed be the most high god oh brother stephen you see it's clear there is abraham there is the most high god and we got melchizedek and melchizedek is blessing abraham and the most high god really you need a prophet and blessed be the most high god which has delivered your enemy into your hand and he abraham gave him tithe of all so the first person that gave that gave path to a heavenly priest amen let me help you up here so the first staff that was given in the scripture was given to a heavenly pastor ever here so normally all of us need to find a pastor and take our task to that pastor because we have not seen anybody giving him tithes yet the first one that gave them tasks is abraham so abraham recognized him as you are my pastor i belong to your church i attend your church and because i attend your church i must bring taft so since i met you pastor he put his hand in his pocket he said here is my thought and he gave taft to a priest of heaven what is a priest of heaven going to do with death do they use path in heaven do they use man in heaven let's go to psalm chapter 110 somebody cried the pastor preached on wednesday i'm here oh my god i'm here amen psalm 110 if you dare you can say amen verse 4 the lord has sown whose sword who's swearing in the lord the lord has sown and will not repent in other words god talked about took a decree and he won't change it regardless of what happened he saw god will never change this this decision is irrevocable amen the lord soul and will not repent you are a did you see that he didn't say d you are a it seems like god is talking to somebody and he's telling that person you are a so we see this is genesis 14. now we are in psalm 110 we find a priest over here depressed so god is telling this man in heaven he say you are a priest forever i thought there is only one priest in heaven right but we found another priest that's going to be pleased forever forever after the order of who when we read that's why brother branham say the problem is our language here we have a problem when they say after the order what does it mean after means like is everybody okay you can't sleep tonight or in the likeness of or resembling everybody here so when they say here you are a priest after the order it doesn't seems like there is another and that priest is following no that priest looked like if you look at him he looked like melchizedek so now the most high god melchizedek a priest that looked like melchizedek going on you are a priest forever after the order of melchizedek everybody clear now let's go to revelation chapter one pick up from sunday blessed be the name of the lord revelation chapter 1 verse 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the priests of the kings of the earth to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood blessed be the name of the lord not somebody else's blood his own blood and has made us kings and water oh i saw a man here come melchizedek this man is a king and he's also here so god wants us also to be king and to be water so are we melchizedek god want his brother his children to be priests kings and priest and there is a priest a man here called melchizedek he is king and priest let this man remember on sunday you remember on sunday that was in christ be also in who thought it not robbery to be don't play with god god is so high nobody's seen him you can't touch him you equal with god no no no no no no no no no no no be humble hallelujah he has made us kings and priests to god and his water to him be glory and dominion forever and ever man let's go to revelation 5 lord help me wednesday wednesday and your time verse 8 and when he had taken the book our beast uh the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps we understand the singing in heaven and golden vowel full of others which are the prayers of the saint and they sung a new song saying you are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for you were slain and have redeem us to to redeem means to bring something back to its original position if we were redeemed back to god it means that we came from who oh at you you coming from god jesus was the one that said i come from god and i'm going water also you also came from god [Music] you really believe it [Music] you believe it but angelo amen you are slain and have redeemers back here as redeemers to god by your what out of every water and a tongue and people and not only did you redeem us back to god but what did you do to us verse 10 and has made us water made us to our water and water and we shall do water [Music] do you know who you are [Music] do you know who you are don't worry my friend we're gonna help you remove those false humility feathers and i call them complexes that you approach god's care amen by the stephen you need to be careful have you seen a young lion being scared going to the big lion you the one that are scared the big lion can roar matter of fact when he rode the younger are jumping and the lion came down in decent time according to revelation 10 and he wrote what do you want me to do you are the one trembling i am not trembling because my father is taking control brother branham said when they lie on raw everything is quiet [Applause] let's pray my friend heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace you love your mercy and for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour father i have done all that a man can do lord if you have given him an ability father now i am surrendering myself lord and my family here lord unto the hand may you move us completely out of the way may you be the one preaching the one hearing the one interpreting the one feeling the one touching and the one doing everything father we rebuke every demonic spirit away from this place may you come and speak to us so and bless also those that are streaming in the name of jesus christ amen blessed be the name of the lord we on part three so buckle up and we can take off quickly but here we are still dealing with the priest on sunday we found out and we explained to you clearly that there is two tabernacle there is a tabernacle in heaven and there is a tabernacle on the earth everybody here so far now we found out that in heaven there is only one tabernacle that is there and moses saw that tabernacle and duplicate the tabernacle on the earth so that if you never been in heaven if you go to israel you look at what israel is doing it gives you already a taste of heavenly fleeing but that was not the true original now we found out with the tabernacle on the earth or the dwelling place of god because god wanted to dwell among his people ever clear we found out that we decoded five dwelling place on sunday the first one was made by moses which was the tabernacle in the wilderness about here then we found the transition when david was a king and david say i built many beautiful houses i want to build for the lord something that is better and god told him that david you know what you shed many blood and there is no way you can build me a tabernacle anybody here your son will go and build the temple and the second dwelling place was the temple of salomon anybody clear which was a solid material and back here then from there on we found out that temple was destroyed and then we built it back again then we got to the third tabernacle which was no more a building no more a tent but the tabernacle was a person a human being and this human being right here was called jesus christ because he said destroy this temple and i will build it up again in three days he was talking about the temple of his body this temple have three places this one three places this one three places and we found later on that paul said that the bride also the church is the temple of the lord anybody clear but even though god told david that you shed so many blood you are not qualified to go ahead and build me a temple we found out that there is something strange about david even though he didn't build the temple but david went and built a tabernacle i thought god told him you're not qualified and when david built that tabernacle that tabernacle was in between the tabernacle of moses and the temple of solomon and it was called the tabernacle of david anybody clear because moses was missing something and david pulled the worship of the seraphim on heaven and brought that worship all the way down now god was so happy and the same god that told david don't do it look he said you were right david actually you're a man after my own heart and god even gave a promise he said brother david i will restore your temple back again and we found that the restoration of that temple happened in the brother everybody now when we look at dwelling place of god in every dwelling place that we know in the old testament speaking about the temple or the tabernacle built by moses the tabernacle built by david and the one built by solomon we found out that there are three things that goes with the tabernacle three major things number one the tabernacle each tabernacle or temple had what we call a ministry or a service unto god anybody following me you're slowing my speed i can feel it like this everybody here somebody's pushing the brake i'm trying to move forward amen then there is something else that goes there not only do we have a ministry but we must have ministers of the ministry or servant everybody here this ministry is the priesthood the servants are the priests are delivered everybody and we have also what we call the sacrifice or the gift that goes with the ministry everybody so we found out that when moses established his temple moses has the levitical priesthood with aaron and they were doing the service of the lord and they were offering blood of bulls and gold and calves and everything the same thing we saw on sunday that in the tabernacle of david david also was offering the things we remember on sunday then when we went to the temple of solomon if you search the scripture they were offering they were offering they were given continually in the team in the temple until jesus came they were still offering everybody here so there was a service going on there was a servant working there and there was also a sacrifice that was continually given daily for the sin of the people now when we switch from these natural or imma uh inanimate object because this building have no life they tend to have no life anybody care the life that was in the tent was the life either of the people working or either of the pillar of fire who was residing there anybody here now when we move in the building of human what who are the servants in this building called jesus everybody here jesus was the temple of god we saw it if he is a temple he must have a sacrifice are we okay if he is a temple he must have a servant in his own temple because the servants were working in the temple the sacrifice were offered in the temple and the ministry must be in the temple take second corinthians chapter five i told you i'm gonna lose all the feathers by the word second corinthians chapter five if you dare you can say amen blessed be the name of the lord oh my you who will who are not in church working make sure you get this before you stay behind on sunday everybody there second corinthians chapter five first one remember there is two temple heavenly temple and water earthly temple we were talking about building hey bark here now we're talking about human as tempo watch more for we know that if our earthly water oh so in human temper there are also temples that are earthly and temple that are also what hallelujah are we am i reading a different bible am i reading a different bible than you keep your seat belt everybody here for we know that if our earthly house paul is calling that a house everybody here so in human tempo anybody care we have an earthly temple [Music] everybody here ever here [Laughter] if our earthly house of this water oh so it's called also tabernacle so not only is it a temple it is also a tabernacle and paul is calling that also a house in other words paul is taking the temple of moses the temple of solomon and mixing everything together everybody if our earthly house of disturbance could be dissolved where dissolved we have a water oh what kind of building is that so paul is calling this also a building so the building now are not the concrete the building now are not the tent the building now a human being so when you see somebody walking you are looking at the building walking that's why on sunday when the bible says that god told um david he says that when they were moving the tabernacle i was going from one place to another the moving off the temple was moving god everybody here ever here now the temple of god are human beings so when you are moving the human beings you are moving the dwelling place of god you are moving the houses of god you are moving the buildings of god you are moving the tent of god oh my god we have a building of water of god a house not made with water did you get something did you get something on sunday the bible say jesus went into a perfect tabernacle not made with what that was a dwelling place in heaven now paul is saying there is also human temple they have a earthly one and they also have a heavenly one not made also with what [Music] oh my god we have a heavenly human temple not made with hands made by god in balka and those temple a house verse one not made with hand camera oh my god did you read well did you read well those houses are how houses that are eternal in water oh my god so we have eternal eternal no beginning no ending what kind of house is that one anybody here verse two for in this building this temple this house this tent this tabernacle in this we grown we are comfortable everybody here earnestly desiring to be close upon so not only are these temples habitation but they are also clothing everybody here we are longing to be clothed with what with our our house watch your bible verse two for in this we grown earnestly desire it's a burning desire to be clothed upon with our house which is from water why do you so desire the house why because originally speaking you should be in the house [Applause] everybody here you should start with the house first that's why brother branham said we bypass our people we bypass our houses the message is perfectly in line with the bible [Applause] when brother branham says that did he ever give you a scripture you resent brother branham god locks it you respect him you humble yourself god open it and in this church we have we respect the prophet so when you are coming in this world you came from that straight to the earthly house so as you were driving you didn't know your house was saying hey hey hey hey get me here ever here the problem is if we would have gotten in the house first the house is how [Music] so we bypass the house so when you get here it's like you lost your wedding ring [Music] do you know what happened you feel like something is missing let me help you up because some are not married if you go outside and you leave your cell phone what happened what happened what happened you can call your supervisor and you say i will be 15 minutes late you will turn again and go get that cell phone because you are living like you you are locked right but here that's why you your your inner being is earnestly dissolved is he sensing like something is missing a part of me is not in me [Music] [Applause] i need to go back and carry my part i am not complete because somebody's there everybody here somebody's there talking so there is enoughly human temple and a heavenly human temple and the heavenly human temple is eternal [Music] in other words it's a living temple it talks everybody that's why when you recognize this message to be eager food you heard from your own temple [Applause] [Music] amen amen hallelujah i am on the surface let's go to verse three and if if so be that being clothed we shall not be found water do you see what nakedness mean now do you see what nakedness means now it is not what you're thinking when you get before god you must have a clothes that cloth is original because jesus taught the the apostle when they were bringing their little children for jesus to bless them they said no no no no they're deserving the master jesus said don't do that you see in heaven there are certain individuals that look like them they are standing beholding the face of the father stop playing with them anybody clear verse 4 for we that are in this water tabernacle do what being water that's why this home this world is not our home ever here not that not for that we should be unclothed but clothes our pawn in other words we're not talking about removing the earthly temple but what we are looking for is to take our heavenly temple and our earthly temple and fuse them together so we will be both human and god [Music] hey back here so we can eat and we can disappear [Applause] remember jesus when he was born he could not disappear they could chase him and get him there but after his resurrection when his tabernacle came back and pick up his earthly tabernacle and fuse them together now jesus can appear and he can disappear ever here now jesus can be standing like this and suddenly he can begin to lift up when they look at him they say it's a ghost he said you don't understand you have a hamburger the word made flesh i'm actualizing you have a hamburger he said give me a hamburger he took the hamburger he ate he said spirit don't eat yet after a while he disappeared again why because the two habitation everybody here ever here you can poke him with every knife you want it won't work anymore help me hey but here being burdened verse 4 not for that we will be unclothed but clove upon that's what mortality might be what with water where is mortality in the heavenly temple or the earthly the earthly temple have mortality this one is eternal so you have eternal life so when this is coming to seek for you in the day of the rapture it is sucking the black dog it is swallowed it's like it's like the snake of moses he get the black dog and swallow him apart of you hallelujah oh my god blessed be the name of the lord now he that has what do you know what that word means do you know what he means he that has wrought do you know what he means oh thank you hui has prepared he he that has prepared us for the water in other words you were programmed for that you were predestinated you were prepared for that process it's just a matter of time and sooner that temple will drop down that temple have a uh he has a countdown it's clock is going like tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick is going like that in other words it's like 60 minutes 59. once that clock hit zero that habitation just dropped from heaven and he knows who he belongs to and when you look you say hey this is me and he said this is me and before you know it you hurt one another [Music] everybody cares so far so in this human temple we have earthly and heavenly ever here so if the temple is human and every temple must have a ministry everybody every temple must have a sacrifice every temple must have a servant and jesus being the temple of god who is the servant of god in the temple of jesus christ take matthew chapter 2 somebody not only is pushing the brake but the second brake how do you call it the one that you lift somebody is really i thought i'm going to go far eman amen matthew chapter 2. you there you there let's go to verse 11. and when they were coming to the house the majors they saw a young child they never saw a baby so your christmas is alive when you put the measures with a baby it's a lie the major saw a young child he was two years old why two years old brother branham said it do you have a scripture herald say kill the children two down the bible say brother branham say we clear now so they saw a young child with me with marry his mother and fell down and worship him can you imagine a two years old walking like this and all the people felling down and worshipping him you look he said what what crazy people are these you can worship a stone marquis when those major came they saw a human being this is just a job the temple of jerusalem was there and when they asked that it just dropped brother greg when they asked them they say we are looking for who we are looking for the messiah we have seen his star and we are coming to the water normally they should worship at the temple he just dropped from heaven normally they should go to israel and go to the temple to worship jehovah but they say we are looking for a human being we are looking for a human temple we know you have a temple in jerusalem but the temple in jerusalem is no more working the true temple have come we're looking for that temple to worship god in that temple [Applause] how yummy is this word that's why when they saw the human being they saw the baby it doesn't matter the age it was god's temple he was emmanuel god with us all they did he just fell down [Applause] it was a transition of temple they recognized the true temple they came in the temple to worship him and when you come to worship what do you bring you are bad [Applause] this church is something [Music] sorry you are good sorry honey i'm just relaxing with my family ever here hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord he said he fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened the water they presented to him water because you are approaching a temple what do you give a gift when they were going to the temple of solomon gift you're going to worship you must bring something and when you're bringing something oh you bringing gift to this baby this child here not baby this young child yes he's the temple of god we must bring gift what gift do you bring i want to see that can i open the box can i open the box please mommy can i open the box can i show you see see what is in there two-year-old amen to him gift number one is water god means what you need a scriptural coat you need coat you come and see me i have a bunch of them god means what deity god means deity everybody so the offering has a revelation amen who touched them to get gold gold karma and water frankincense and water mer speck of death we already went through that but there is another one called here frankie says why do you bring frankincense where did you see that oh my god in god's gift always found their places brother brother said frankie says we want to get this quickly frankie says is the water the offering of service to her if you want to put this scripture down leviticus whatever and leviticus 16 6 to water in other words brother branham is telling you that frankie says was used in the old tabernacle everybody they were using that for service in the old tabernacle about here now we are in the new tabernacle we also need frankincense everybody now frankincense means offering of sacrifice means offering of service to jehovah we found out that is the order of the priesthood to make an offering to jehovah when he made the offering he had to be made and mixed with frankincense for a sin offering they took different things and makes him for the meal offering for the wave offering frankie says was added because he was acceptable to jehovah if he was anointed with water which means it is a service to jehovah god remember a temple goes with the ministry or the service are you okay now and he goes with the a servant and he goes with a sacrifice hallelujah and brother branham continues he says and now we found that his deity gold and they brought him frankincense was a tap that he was uh to who so now when we get to human tempo about here the temple the the the person the human itself is a temple are we okay and the same human is not only a temple but his life is a service anybody here and not only is the same human service he is himself a servant go to matthew chapter 12 over there he was separated you see the building you see the surface you see the people when you put it in human being it's a combo it's like a hamburger you have tomato you have salad all of them it's in one so when you say give me a sandwich you are asking for tomato for salad for whatever everything together that's inhuman but if you go to walmart you got to buy the bread you got to buy the tomato you got to buy this and do service hallelujah go to matthew chapter 12 verse 15. if you're there you can say amen blessed be the name of the lord you there but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from there and great multitude follow him and he healed them all why did he heal them all you will see that down the road and charge them that they should not make him known that he might be fulfilled which was spoken by who isaiah the prophet saying behold my who is servant oh so you're saying jesus was a servant here everybody here now so the human being is himself a temple he is himself a service and he is himself a servant ever here hallelujah behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall show judgment to the water i thought this for was for the jews i thought this was for the jews ever here watch brother branham here brother branham said in saint matthew 12. we just read it 15-21 we found out that he was jehovah's servant make sense you saw it now behold my servant in whom i'm well pleased and he was and i put my strength upon him so his life was anointed with frankincense to jehovah's service what a gift to them my wise man gave see it was something the gift that they gave was something to identify jesus as jehovah water so in human temple the human itself is a temple the human life itself is a service and the human himself is a servant so now we have the service we have the minister or the servant we are lacking the sacrifice but here you want to know the sacrifice let's go to hebrew chapter eight the big the book of hebrew now is wide open at the opening of the seventh seal when i hear people saying the seventh seal the seventeen you don't have to know you don't know what you're talking about how many been at the mechanic have you seen the power tool they have big power too and they have small one so they usually go by the small one you will hear them and they pull the nut and sometimes when they put it you will see some of the nuts are hard to unlock so they have to switch power tool they have to get one that look like a bazooka and once that one comes you will hear the noise of a change it doesn't go volvo you here and no matter how tight the knot is that one will open it that's how the seals are everybody here when you find a scripture in the bible that you try to understand it's locked you try to understand its look take the seals and hook the seal to the scripture it doesn't matter how long the scripture is they still will have decoded the scripture because at the opening of the seven seal the bible became a new book so i don't like when people play with the seven seals if he was not for these seals we could be under baptist and the methodist and the presbyterian and and the pentecostal we will not even have what we have here but thank god for the seal the sales make the difference [Music] [Applause] people pray with the seals they thought the seal was information [Music] the seals are not information the seals are revelation [Applause] [Music] in other words brother branham say at the opening in other words the opening of the sevens here release a special anointing of god like never before because the one who breaks the seals is who in other words they still bring the lamb in the place and the lamb is the author of the book so that's why the lamb can decode everything in the scripture [Applause] you don't have to know the seventy really really you don't have to know the seventeen in laodicea we will be in trouble now we can see the enemy from far off and we can say we see you [Applause] [Music] hallelujah even if the enemy get in the message and camouflage himself we can detect him [Applause] hallelujah because in this message we have been camouflaged on the pulpit and on the lady how are you going to decode hallelujah you need something like joy like jehoshaphat 400 prophets say something but something in you is saying you don't know they caught him you don't have the scripture but something is there is saying it is your heavenly tabernacle [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's why you stood for the message without knowing all of this and because you stood for the message god is unfolding the message [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now it's a joy to come to church it's a joy to live for christ it's a joy to worship god it's a joy it's a joy it's a joy the message is no longer a burden the message is a joy it's a life [Applause] nobody can take you out nobody nobody you should be with me at work today i was sitting and then dancing talking about talking about talking about a good doorway and working [Applause] [Music] i tried to dig into the the ingredients of the anointing all and my computer started turning around and i said talking about and i just restarted back again you're just wasting your time [Applause] the message is not a burden where was it [Applause] ever here let's go to hebrew 18. where am i at you see [Music] [Music] if i keep this on sunday then somebody said he's a pastor he's not preaching on wednesday you know i sit at home and i can hear those things going on and i can catch them i say yes no problem okay hebrew chapter 8. sometimes i can read the message and i can hear a legalistic spirit comes and give me his uh his his point of view then suddenly the holy ghost gives me the answer then i keep it and i lock it and i sit down and when i talk to people you're going to hear somebody speaking exactly that and i just pulled the answer and i said say how do you know all of this amen all right now we have the ministry and the service we know the servant we know the minister now we need to know the sacrifice hebrew chapter 8 let's go to verse 3. for every water every high priest is ordained or appointed to offer water and water wherefore it is of necessity that this man have something also to do with them clear if you are a temple you have a ministry you have a service you must also have something to offer what is the sacrifice that you have christ everybody here in the old testament and the moses they were offering lambs animals back here under david they were also offering lambs an animal because it started from the garden of eden whenever offered a lamb when adam and eve seen god kill a lamb america when abraham took isaac to the mountain they have to take a ram which is a male realm here so we got a lamb here we got a lamb here in the temple of solomon we got lambs in the temple of jesus do we have lambs one day john the baptist was baptizing people [Music] he put one on the wall they come out he put one on the wall they come out and suddenly he saw a man walking and that man was jesus christ when john look he never said hey cousin he was under the anointing in his ministry he said below the lamb the lamb of god in other words the human temple the human being is the temple the life is the service the human itself is the servant and the same human is the sacrifice [Music] so you are a temple you are a servant you are a sacrifice and you are also a service lord when did we see you and gave you water when did we see you seek and we came to visit you when were you in prison and we come to see you you know those temples that were there when you were talking to those temples whatever you were doing to this temple you were doing that unto me [Music] go to hebrew 9. verse 26 if you're there you can say amen for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world he has appeared to put away water by the sacrifice of what can you read it with me by the sacrifice of what so the temple is the service is the servant is also the sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah jump to verse 28 so christ was was what he's not offering something else he's offering himself was once offered to bear the sins of many and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to water the next verse the next chapter is hebrew 10 job to verse five you there wherefore when he comes into the world he says water and water you will water i don't want to deal with this temple anymore i'm done with human with a man-made temple now i switch that's why sacrifice an offering i don't want it anymore i begin to look for tempo in a different caliber servant in a different caliber sacrifice in a different caliber service in the different caliber that's why he taught the woman everywhere behold it's no more in jerusalem it's no more in the mountain but the true worshiper will worship the father in the and in water that's the temple god is looking for anybody here sacrifice an offering you would not in other words you desire not anymore but a water a body of who anymore which body does he desire so once even are we killing people but a body have you what prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrificed for sin you have had water it was just a temporary things god was not really looking for that he was just a substitute until the perfect things come now when the perfect things come what i'm looking for i'm looking for human beings i want to get in them i want to borrow their body hallelujah job to verse 10 by the witch will we are sanctified everybody seen that by the which will we are sanctified through the offering do you see that off the water body of who was for what so when it comes to human being the human is the temple of god he is the tenth of god he is the tabernacle of god he is the house of god he is the clothing of god he is the jacket of god he is the service of god he is the servant of god and he is the sacrifice of god that's why you heard brother branham saying god have no hands but your hand he have no feet back everybody here so this temple we found out it's sacrificed we found that it's ministry we found out each servant this one we saw it this one we saw it does the bride have also a servant do we have sacrifice yes do we have ministry do we have frankincense hallelujah go to romans 12. [Laughter] oh my god blessed be the name of the lord let's go back to the bible let's go back this is back to the bible the message came to bring us back to the bible [Applause] [Music] the denomination added stuff the catholic added stuff the protestant added stuff they put everybody in confusion so when the message came the message took us back to the bible [Applause] how many scriptures do we read here [Music] let's he cut he recalibrate our shooting roman chapter 12. let's go back to the bible what are we doing because at the opening of the seals the bible became anew

you present here do you have a bible because some of you look at me i don't know if you have the bible do you have your bible i beseech thee i beg you therefore brother by the mercies of god that you present your water a living water when it comes to human the body itself is a sacrifice [Music] that's why paul was struggling with the hebrew because the hebrew wanted to bring animals paul keeps saying this is over this is over they don't get it they say you come to destroy the law of moses jesus said i never come to destroy the law i came to fulfill the law the law was shadow the lamb that you were killing was only shadow i am the lamb when i'm killed it's over i resolve your problem [Applause] [Music] present your body a living water so not only is the body of jesus christ the sacrifice your body is also uh that's why we we are careful what we doing in the body [Music] because we want to keep our body air sacrifice a temple that's why you want to keep yourself pure that's why you don't want to play around with your body that's why you don't want to prostitute your body because your body is a sacrifice when you keep it pure god is happy he's looking at you and he said i can smell the good order of his sacrifice you don't have to burn an animal for god to smell it no the life that you leave is a service it's bringing perfume perfume and god when he smell he say that's my boy and then he showered the blessings in return as an appreciation for what you're doing for him [Applause] two ways two ways i can sit here and tell you stop adultery stop this stop this oh i can tell you what i just told you and it takes care of everything bring the message back to the platform and the message will take care of everything [Music] we have established human being in the pulpit human beings in platform that's why we're in trouble all we're doing here is establishing the word back to the pulpit the bible said brother branham said the bible said brother brown i'm saying that's what's gonna save you [Applause] we establish personality and look in the mess we are [Music] if the personality goes out everybody goes out if the personality hates somebody the whole church hates somebody because of personality was established in the church and not the world bring the word back to preeminence jesus said when i am lifted up i will draw amen [Music] jesus said you don't take the light and put it under though well don't work you you pick the light and then put it up and the light will take care of it either we can sit here and begin to count to you different name of sins that was the law do not care do not commit adultery do not do this many many many many commandments until the people even forget jesus say sin is unbelief just kill unbelief i don't have to know the curriculum of of how many sins are there i don't have to study macrobiology to know all the diseases i am the lord that heal you of all your diseases that's all i want to know [Applause] either i can preach you microbiology or i can just preach you the healing power of god when you understand that your body is a living sacrifice that takes care of it then you'll be careful what you put in the body what do you do to the body how you treat the body because it's a tempo of the holy ghost that's all [Music] amen i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present to your body a living sacrifice if i have ten to preach today i'm in one how many sides did i play here i told my wife i said i don't know if i can preach this on wednesday amen i beseech you therefore brethren by

what human temper service sacrifice who's the servant you okay oh my god let's go to romans 15. romans 15 verse 15. my god where are we at oh time time time time if we can speak like joshua and all the time so when everybody wake up in the morning they say i slept too long today somebody held the time it's a sense of humor to relax here you ready the shaking put it then they can add more verse 15 nevertheless present i have written them more boldly to you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of god that's a problem ready let me leave it verse 16 that i should be the minister of jesus christ today remember peter was to the jew to the gentile camera ministering the gospel of god comma that the offering up after am i reading a different bible they're offering up they are offering the gender we are an offering they're offering up of the gender may be acceptable being sanctified by the water we are also sacrificed we are gifts we are offering who is the priest who is the priest you want to know him take hebrew 13. oh my god when you get a chance you go home sit down and get these get get a book and start writing you say okay for this these are my scriptures for this these are my scriptures so when the devil come you say come let me show you something you just said you say sit beside me it is written it is written it is written it is written hey hebrew 13 verse 15. anybody there about your brother mickey hebrew 13 you there verse 15 but somebody already got it but the polycarp got it did you get it can we read it together you ready verse 15 by him therefore somebody need to offer remember the principle if you're a high priest you must have something to offer we already found that our body are the sacrifice but who's going to offer the body who who's going to offer who will do the service of offering because god come and he just do this behold i stand at the door and do what if you if you give me the sacrifice i will do it and i will sit with you and me and you begin to to eat you see by him therefore let me it's the brother let us offer the water of what do you remember on sunday do you remember on sunday you remember on sunday [Music] offer the sacrifice of water remember in heaven the four beasts were praising god how 24 hours you remember when david came he took the priest and he put them he said you will never work we will pay you a salary your job 24 hours so first shift second shift third shift because we want the praises to go all the way there in the temple because in heaven it is all the way the heaven is empty the one who was in heaven is here so we gotta keep him 24 hours in other words when the musician who brother michael daley brother said sister destiny i play when they start getting tired the other one are getting in the church singing so they blend when they blend the other one go home to sleep [Music] here 24 hours 24 hours so let's see how much also you must bring sacrifice [Music] verse 15 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of what to god the how [Music] and if he inhabited the presence of his people when you always under a constant worship [Music] this is how you drive devils peacefully [Applause] peacefully [Music] not peacefully you just leave your christian life and the devil what abraham said when they put peach if i'm not mistaken peach in the in the ark of moses what was a peach yeah they pitch it what about them say smell bad so when they took it they put it in the nile river when the crocodile were coming when they just smell everybody here because it was peach it was done for that purpose and moses is there just singing and the crocodile keep moving everybody and the crocodile says there is a baby there when they smell this baby smell bad but he was not moses maybe moses would turn and look at them and say ooh beautiful crocodile da da da da he keep going [Music] so when you live a life of service a life of perfume a life of worship a life of praise you are the you are creating an atmosphere and when the devil comes they just smell not this home not this home in the temple of jesus christ in the temple of jesus christ when jesus was was approaching an evil spirit who was talking did you hear jesus talking what was making the spirit talk well because he was the temple he was the sacrifice he was the service and he himself was the priest so when he approached the devil says please tell me what to go tell me where to go just go ahead quickly there are a pig over there can i get there yeah go that's it a peaceful peaceful way you just live in your own life and it's just when when you pass somebody somebody say she is different you always say there is something just sweet about you what they are telling you is the frankincense hallelujah it is the sa it is the frankincense oh my god that's why you hear people say uh uh uh a peter say a woman to have a quiet and a mix which is a water because just that spirit that says it is driving devil out hello you okay he got me mad i will talk to him hold on that's no problem go ahead and sit and eat because he was looking for fuel for somebody to tell him yeah get him get him instead somebody's poking that [Laughter] let's go to verse 15. by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of water to god continually that is the of our world tongue and power tongue and power off our lips giving water to water [Music] the faith of abraham giving thanks hallelujah but to do good and to communicate in other words share with others forget not for with such sacrifice god is well water is that difficult this temple got a ministry got a minister got a sacrifice same for this same for jesus same for the brother you are the temple of god you are the sacrifice of god you are the servant of god and you are the service of god and you are the priest of god and not only are you priests but now you're gonna get king [Applause] it's 9 30 on the dot i gotta stop here [Music] one coat i have i don't know 74 move over there see what it is you see what it is it's three tabernacles there is two tabernacles one in heaven one on the earth there is a man called melchizedek christian king he wants also his children to be just like him priest and king he opened up the way the tabernacle got a ministry he got a servant and he have a sacrifice it happened to every tabernacle and as an individual you are the temple of god you are the houses of god you are the tabernacle of god you are the building of god and let's finish with this second coat two or three witnesses let's get two now if we could only do that to identify our lives see our lives to be identified as jehovah's that is what frankincense was for that made him jehovah servant when you realize what are you doing here where did we come from or what business we got being here we was not put here just by chance we were put here for uh and we must serve that [Music] but still we are back on the basis of free moral agency where we can serve it or just like adam did in there but we know the free moral agency is a trap for the serpent seed not for the children of god because god put in you the love of the truth that even if you don't feel like it but something is sucking that up [Applause] living sacrifice acceptable to god which is a reasonable service let our life let's our home let our children let our houses be the temples of god amen and we and the more deeper we get you will understand why brother branham say the beauty of a church is the you will understand why brother random say that you see brother branham also was moving from the natural building into human being because that was the true temple that's where god wanted to be worshiped in spirit and truth it's human lives because at the beginning he was elohim he existed by he didn't like it he was boring then he wanted to be god god means a an object of what he loves to be worship and he created you and me so he can have a family and be worshipped and when you leave your life you cooking you are worshiping him amen you you you changing a diaper you worshipping him because you're taking care of his child when you're doing your duty responsibility it's a worship amen amen you don't understand what i'm saying if god say husband take care of your home when you take care of your home it's a worship. [Applause] it's a worship that's why you heard brother branham say when a woman serve a husband is serving god because what you're doing is a worshiper it's a worship it's a worship you give offering it's a worship you don't give it to the church it's a worship that's why brother branham say offering is a part of worship so when you're taking five dollars you're putting that just doing that you are worshipping you cleaning the bathroom you didn't hear him i put a quote here when brother branham said when god was birthing you some of you were birthed to be mothers and things like that it's a worship when you living for the very purpose he sends you here you are actually reflecting him you are actually reflecting his mind in other words if god wanted you to be a doctor when you become a doctor you are reflecting his mind it doesn't mean only oh hallelujah oh glory to god you're the jehovah you jehovah you [Music] it's a normal living by you doing that like unto them and jesus that's why you heard paul saying that even when you at work you render service to those people to that company like you doing that unto them so when you're going to work it's air [Applause] i know this is checking everything because he said do it like you do it so let me pick up amazon so when you're working on amazon because that's what i hear all the time so when you're working on amazon paul say do the service to amazon like you doing that to god anybody here so when you're working i'm not really working for amazon did you hear me did you hear me because when you get mad you get mad at the boss but when you understand that i'm doing this as unto the lord that's why we honestly work we honor we want to be doing things what you are doing that like because of christ you are living a life for him this is a higher level you can drive your car and that's why an anointing can come on you you think because you did this that's why they are not income sometimes you just relax and hit the thought job you don't understand that the problem is the atmosphere is constantly god that's why the the cell phone from heaven keeps crossing you everybody here that's what it is that's what it is until you become addicted just like take you no no did not die you we fail i mean something came up to you always thinking about god connection connection disconnect to the world connect to the husband you will see this you're going to walk in the midst of quran and you're just still smiling the people are panicking you are joyful it doesn't mean you are joyful because you have a lot of money that's not what is making you joke because you are living in the holy of holi you are shut down from the world it's a different atmosphere when somebody contacts you when they come with different thoughts if you just

consecrate the more your mind is focused on him things will change now you're gonna see the world in a different view and you will appreciate the goodness of god that's why you heard brother branham say when a god when a man have god inside of him he see god everywhere because he's living in a different worship somebody's looking at something somebody's looking at something else he said wow praise the lord how can you say praise the lord because your eyes are seeing things in a different atmosphere amen let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father
