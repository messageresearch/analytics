theophany back and forth from Teresa or all the way to Celestia amen amen and she's a real touch on the great is that faithfulness I don't know what you're doing looking at Mal slad in other words it means the holy spirit is working somehow amen so everybody looking good good singing good people they even look good here I gave you a quote yesterday amen they look good here brother Robert I was looking I say should I lay hand for a wedding anniversary again you will get it later and it's good like that so that you can get it later amen everybody look good the blessed be the name of the Lord how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand my friend when I say up to date I mean Wednesdays and everything amen amen glory to God how many are reading their Cod book blessed be the name of the Lord praise God somebody's lacking how about your church order the church uh ages glory to God Amen remember next Saturday we have our question and answer it will be at 2 30 radical is that okay 2 30 and the place will be uh send on the group chat so look at the address it will tell you the place exactly we already have a place not on our secret meeting place but it's a backup secret meeting place amen so check your email I'll check your uh WhatsApp group chat you will see exactly where the place is and the time is still the same at 2 30. I'm even amazed there are few people that are still not having their number in the uh announcement group so if you miss an announcement it is beyond me that's between you and the Lord amen I already know how to deal with this amen glory to God that will be next Saturday on March the 18th everybody okay glory to God uh someone asked this question before and I was lingering to see how the spirit will lead how many received the message I sent throughout the week about the warning some didn't receive it okay praise God if you cannot receive the message you need to talk to Brother David so we make sure you receive it amen So based on that we discuss with the Deacon but I want to make sure the church decide what we want to do it's about prayer amen you need to increase your prayer we in a very treacherous time and the devil is fighting left and right amen we got somebody in the hospital we should not be playing around when someone is still lingering in the hospital somebody need to stand before the Lord and push very hard so that whoever is in the hospital need to come out amen so we came up with uh one Wednesday every two months after two months one Wednesday we will exert and then stop maybe exhort for 30 minutes and stop and then we start praying battle if you are streaming we will cut off the streaming we cannot let you on the streaming praying with people right here it's not going to work make sense because when people are praying they're praying so I don't know how we will keep the streaming on people praying if the spirit get on someone we don't want it going world one everybody okay so every two months one Wednesday we exhort a little bit for 30 minutes amen then we stop the exhortation and we start praying all the way to the end and we go home everybody is free to express what do you want if you are for it please raise your hand thank you my brother and sister if you are against it don't be shy we're not going to penalize you raise your hand even if you say no it's normal nobody is against it so brother Kelly we need to find out which one is it to start not every month because we have question and answer we don't want to overload you but every two months one Wednesday we exhort 30-minute stop exhorting we go to prayer if you want to pray you stay here pray pray pray pray until God come down amen then after prayer we all go home so we will get some refreshing everybody happy glory to God so that was about prayer Glory to God someone asked me this question so I'm going to remind it brother abrahamara will be here on April the 30th which is a Sunday and on May the 3rd which is a Wednesday so he will be here April 30th which is a Sunday May 3rd which is a Wednesday and then on Thursday he will be heading straight to brother chadland everybody got that one amen glory to God yesterday we have a wonderful meeting I wish all of you were there not only to sing in the church but even when you're listening to the music at home you will know what kind of music to pick not even even if you don't want to sing in church but I wish all of you were here at this time I don't have a go ahead from the boss to release whatever was spoken yesterday for the public amen I will wait until he tells me to do that the meeting was three hours and 33 minutes three three everybody okay we went through the scripture we went through code scripture quote scripture quote scripture we start with music from heaven and we drop it down I could not finish we have to stop at 3 hours 33 minutes so the next time you need to tell me brother John you need to work again we need to have part two where I'm going to deal with the music in church and the musician life themselves and we see how it's working but whatever was given yesterday is enough for you to get it and you can trace every single music all over the world amen like I said yesterday I said this church is like heaven amen we got black people we got Caucasian we got Hispanic we got people from Africa people it's like heaven and this is the way we're going to be in heaven so which music is right now which music is right American music African music Canadian music European music which music is that we dealt with it yesterday amen that's why we went in the word with the message of the hour and we lay everything so when we are calibrating music it doesn't have anything to do with your country it doesn't have anything to do with your civilization or your community nothing he has all of them have to do with the word of God amen amen in other words we can sing music for America we can sing music from Africa we can sing music from Europe we can sing music from South America as long as all those music can be filtered with what was presented yesterday everybody okay so there is no standard for me it is the standard of the word of God and the message of Yahweh everybody okay and I promise because we didn't finish I'm not gonna give it to you now but whoever won the quote that I was reading give your name to the Deacon so that by next question uh next uh music session I will have I will know how many copies we need and I will print them out the same quote I have yesterday because I had nine pages so I cannot put that on the group chat that would be a lot of work for me so if you want it you go ahead and you give your name to the Deacon so we know how many copies we need to copy and when you come in on the next uh part two of our music we hand it to you and we both read the code together and you take it for your reference everybody okay hey everybody okay so whatever was established yesterday there was a lot of people yesterday I took them as a witness between me and the church and before God if you are not there for legitimate reason praise the Lord if you know and you were not there that is between you and the Lord I don't have anybody's blood in my hand I did what I have to do I stay up till 5 a.m in the morning and then I woke up at nine o'clock toward ten o'clock and I was awaking all day up then I went home and sleep an hour and 30 minutes and I worked till four o'clock today and you see me in the morning so all that labor is because of you it is up to you to take advantage of it everybody okay so if you were not there that's between you and the Lord and the way we express it if you want to sing send your music ahead of time through the song leader I don't want any fusses with the song leader because we give you the same standard what was presented yesterday is for you for the song leader for me for everybody we on the same page and if you judge yourself already you will pass the inspection pretty much without any problem everybody okay so if you want to sing like three because the song leader usually have the their song like three days in advance and they send it in the cloud and all the musicians have it and the rehearse and everything so if you want to sing something go ahead and send it to the song leader let him handle it everybody okay everybody good so don't send your song at 10 40 when the service start at 11 o'clock everybody okay so far everything we've been singing Here 97 of it was fine I didn't see any problem but because the question arises we want to deal with it everybody good so remember let's respect the order that has been placed I gave you three scripture yesterday about order and I have a fourth one if you want it next time I will give you the fourth scripture about order there is no way you can have a church without order there is no way you can have a home without order there is no way you can have a company without order everywhere you're going there is order there is only one place where there is no order you know that place is where hell so brother John Porter you work with the musician you work with the Deacon you find the date and you let me know so I will see when we can we make sure the majority of the people are there so when they ask you a question are you going to be there even if you're not going to be there please send us a response so we choose an appropriate date to make sure you're not caught up at work or you don't have something so we make sure at least the majority of the people are going to be there because we don't want to penalize you because somebody is there but if you don't respond we don't know whether you're working or not so let us know give us your feeling you say brother Stephen I want to be there but this is what is happening buddy Stephen I want to be there but I'm working some people call me and say well Stephen we want to be there but I'm at work I can listen but um I mean uh there is a lot of noises here I cannot so let me know so I know what to do and make sure every body satisfied everybody okay everybody good and somebody did something very fantastic last night that was Sister Divine she took note very good those three hours and 33 minutes she took note and she put all the notes and lined them up very good and put it in the young people chat so every young people that probably miss you already have a summary put together by Sister divine [Applause] upon the authority of the local church let me go this way upon the supreme authority brother Branham say that of the local church amen and of my freedom as a pastor she said Divine come and get this [Applause] I was so thrilled thank you for the label God richly bless you amen glory to God I ambushed you you could not think about something like this amen I even got your name last night did exactly the way you write it but I won't tell you how I got it that's my secret everybody okay so that was very good God richly bless you amen three hours 33 minutes I have to drink two bottles of water Robert thank you for the first bottle of water and thank you for the second one God richly bless you so you pray for me because I have to stand here and preach again okay I need you you need me so we can work together okay I have noticed something online give me time because I have to lay out something that is very deep I have noticed online I don't know I believe probably all of you have noticed that people make uh take brother branham's coat and they probably will put brother Brandon pictures around it and they put a coat and they say it came from Brother Branham and they give you the message and they're usually beautiful sometimes they would take a picture of brother Branham or put a like a background like a design and make it look good and they say this code came from this message Discord and I usually see people posting them on the WhatsApp which is very good I saw it but there was a particular quote that are so been posted by someone and it's brother Branham and for some reason like usually uh sleep up from my time into social media patrolling as a pastor I have a quote for it I have a quote okay and then I saw the quote then I was interesting and when I read the quote something ring in me like right around them spoke something like this say wait a minute I never heard such a quote what is the code you want to know about it yes yes all right let's start glory to God amen this is the looks beautiful is that it that's the code everything look good the layout is good and someone put this to kinda maybe give a message to somebody online about the court or something that they were listening to the message and he caught them and they want to share so someone else will know and that was the quote that was put online and it was going on on WhatsApp and I picked up the code and according to the court brother Branham say a Charming woman he's one who maintains correct water uh you ready I will need you today my friend and walk like a lady she is an example of a jewel on Earth I like anything that is graceful I think that a woman who keeps her place and tried to be a lady is a sculpture of Honor where did this come from 50 seal from the fifth seal when I read this something rang the bell on me amen if you look right here there is a word called Charming I want you to listen to this because sometimes we copy one another on social media somebody post something you like it you also pick it up and you go post it and somebody should see it from you pick it up and post and before you know it it's all over the world you need to be careful what you're posting everybody okay according to the person who put this up brother Branham used the word a Charming woman and if you notice again brother Branham say that is one who maintain correct posture everybody okay and there is also oh my God the devil the devil nobody else but the devil but too late my friend if you look again not even my anyway my friend because Jesus called Judah his friend but Judah was the devil but you're not really my friend everybody okay everybody okay okay so that a woman who keeps her place and tries to be a what lady is a water sculpture if you look there is a word saying Charming one say is one who maintain a correct word postures and the other ones say who keeps and another one says she's here when I saw the word Charming I say something is wrong I opened the message of database and I put the word Charming because they gave a reference of the fifth seal when I put the word Charming I pull it no quote is coming out I want you to be aware of this whoever is online who's not here I changed the word I put another word I pulled the code it's not working I said what's going on we need to wake up this message has been infiltrated everybody okay so I use different keys and finally I got the quote where it came from then I pulled the code this is the code everybody okay the court is the fifth seal everybody okay brother Branham says this you can verify the home the one on the computer please stay tight with me he said although in the grace that they look at I think a water woman a water a nice woman look what they put a water show me but the problem continue is how a nice woman that the water oh the cells why what has hold herself right means everybody okay look what they did to brother Branham zip code they use is one who maintain the water was brother Brown I'm talking about the posture do you see what people are doing online so my friend before you copy something before you pick up something because they say brother Brian I'm saying be careful that's right everybody okay and brother Branham said that and walk like a lady she is they cut all of that up I want the message to be left the way he was spoken I don't want you to cut anything even the punctuation just leave it that way leave it twice don't clean enough you should have done it when brother Branham was alive everybody okay in other words you don't air brush the message [Applause] everybody okay and then he continued brother banam said she's an example of a jewel on Earth that's what it is there I like they took one eye out I like anything that is how graceful we are right here I think a woman that the water they change the word who keeps everybody okay her place and try to be a lady is a water statue look at the word they use a water sculpture is a sculpture a stature before you copy something online before you ask people give me that so I can post it make sure you verify in the message what you taking because you might be sending a wrong signal you might be making brother Branham say something he didn't everybody okay whoever is doing this if you get in this channel you need to stop it everybody okay if you notice the court come from the fifth cell rather it's coming from the fifth seal and that makes it even very dangerous why dangerous brother Branham say if you if you have never heard if you ever believe I have ever said anything in a sermon that is how inspired you take them tapes on the what Seven Seals how can you take something from the seals and change it brother Barnum continue he say if you ever heard anything that is really as I can say it is how thus say the Lord get those those what tips on what on the seventh year how can you change something on the 17th in the message the souls that are in prison brother Branham say one of them he would not permit us to know we already talked about it how many was here at the Water Seven Seals and heard the congregation say what amen the seventh seal he would not permit it he stood right there in the room and revealed water everywhere every one of them every one of the seal and if I have if I ever preach anything in my life was inspired it was water that and he ought to be helped you to who to you don't temper with the seals and don't even temper with the message why brother Branham say now this is just a little service and it shall blend right in with it too so listen to water every word and do what catch it that's why we don't want you to change the words if you are taking it on tape or anything then you stay right with that water teaching don't say nothing but what the temple says just say just what exactly exactly what the tap did what says they're talking about a nice woman you put a Charming woman everybody okay we are going to now because some of these things we are going to understand a whole lot about this now why it is what misunderstood and you'll be sure to say just what the table says don't say what anything else now don't say what nothing else nothing else because I don't say that of my own who is him so when you changing word what are you doing um everybody okay it is him that says it so many times what confusion confusion people will raise up and say well so and so say and he means so and so let's just do whatever leave it just away in water is if you want to put a posting online coming from the message of the hour leave it the way brother Brandon spoke about it don't change even a grammatical error leave the arrow the way he was spoken don't change anything [Applause] they never gave you a commission to correct the message they gave you a commission to repeat the message [Applause] I don't know what's wrong with people irreverent let's go to our scripture if you know the caliber of brother Branham you should not even temper that's why you hear people saying brother Branham saying you go search there is no code why so and so say so and so say so and so say and then before you know it we got in trouble because we made brother Branham say something he never you have your preference you do what you want but not me I would not change the prophet's word you need to know which prophet you're dealing with amen just changing changing changing changing this is not the word of man we are not feeding in the word of man we are feeding on the unfailing body work of The Who how can you change even the word of Jesus Christ who are you you call me crazy let me say this thank you very much even if brother Branham saying something that I have not seen in the scripture yet me I take it first and I humble myself I told the preacher recently like a couple days ago I say when brother Branham says something number one I mean humble yourself remember that he is the pastor of the agent he is the messenger of the age and respect him first and when you begin to respect him then you go to prayer and because of respect to our brother Branham God will love and felt to you what really brother brother was saying how many times did you meet the angel of the Lord how many times so you want to challenge somebody who was with the angel every day almost come on [Applause] how many times did you see the angel of the Lord amen the angel of the Lord took his hand and put on somebody's t-shirt and more can imprint there and brother Branham came and took his hand and put it there and he matches who are you [Music] [Applause] what do you know [Applause] you're reading the scripture today you think you know the scripture better than brother Branham brother Branham put his Bible not even a sermon book he put his Bible he looked at preacher he said come over here take the Bible and disprove me who did it Where Angels are even afraid to walk false fools [Music] Jesus used that word fools I have a scripture [Music] the Bible even say a fool it's rather in the scripture you want to play with the message I'm sorry I'm a wrong Pastor to you you need to find Pastor that play with the message not me in this church the Bible say brother Branham say period where they understand it or not I will stay with brother brother don't give me your preference they give you an easy job listen to the tape pray read your Bible you have plenty sermon to preach you don't want to listen you want to just maneuver touch here do this please give me my time okay let's go to Genesis chapter 38. you look you say who can do something like this a Charming woman go tell your wife Charming playing with the message we're gonna get into something very difficult very difficult very difficult it is very difficult and preacher run away from this okay I can give you the quote go give to a preacher you see I know what I'm talking about okay thank God for his grace because when he opened up to me I was looking around looking around I didn't know what to do my wife was upstairs I say if she was here I would have hugged her everybody okay everybody okay it is very difficult so please let me go slowly and stay alert okay it's dangerous okay I wanted to move with theophany a Dodge it deliberately I say I'm not going to touch it then they keep coming I want to move 50 off I need the bus stop move it open it up I'm gonna put it there so please please pay attention you who online I'm preaching for this church okay very difficult but God will help us let's go to Genesis 38. verse 11. you there amen then you know the story then say Judah to Tamer his daughter-in-law remain a widow you know what happened she was married to the son of Judah didn't have a children and they flipped the flip and the third one was younger amen then Judah look he said no if I give you my children it looks like two of them you already killed him this woman is a witch or something ah you stay over there I I I'm not gonna give the third one if you notice the third one was younger than the woman I already dealt that with the young sisters let me keep moving they know what I'm talking about amen then say Judah to Tema his daughter-in-law remain a widow at your father's house till Sheila my son be grown you might be seated for he said let's perhaps he died also you see he was playing tricks he died also as his breath indeed and Tema went and dwelled in her father's house my brother stayed tight to help me amen in a microphone and in the in process of time the daughter of sure judah's wife died amen amen amen and was comforted let me go back again and in process of time the daughter of shua judah's wife died and was comforted and went up to his ship chair in other words Judah doesn't have any wife anymore to timna he and his friend ARA the abdullamite and he was told Tema saying behold your father-in-law goes up to timna to the uh to share his sheep so maybe she have some FBI some Secret Service because they gave her information that your father-in-law is over there he doesn't want to give you your husband and she put her widow's garment off from her and cover her with a veil and wrap herself we went through this before but I'm gonna take a different angle and sad scripture have a compound meaning and sat in an open place which is by the way of timna for she saw that Sheila was watered grown she was he was a grown-up in other words my husband is grown I need my husband and she was not given to him as a wife in that way that did my part but I'm not getting my promise when Judah saw her he thought had to be a Holland this is a father with his sister his daughter-in-law amen because he had covered because she had covered her face verse 16 and he turned to her by the way and say go to I pray let me come into you for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will you give me that you may come into me and he said I will send you a kid from The Flock and she said will you give me a pledge till you send it in other words it happened that Judah left his wallet amen amen amen everybody okay he was living with his friend he got in his car he forget his uh his wallet and driver license and the little bit the money he put in his wallet everything stayed there so when he was uh at the store he reached the store he was looking for his wallet Judah cannot find a wallet the woman said okay you don't have a wallet you don't have money what are you going to give me he said no I promise to you when I go home I send you the money on cash up everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay ah the woman said no no no no no no no what is going to prove me that after you get what you want you're gonna send money I need something that I can hold to make sure that my money will be back everybody okay this is a father and a daughter-in-law you ready verse 18. and he said Play What pledge shall I give you in other words the woman look he say ah there is a ring there give me that ring remember this ring is the ring of Judah we went through that it is not the Ring of Joseph it is not the Ring of issachar Judah was where the lineage of the king where Jesus Christ must come the king always come from Judah everybody okay the perfect King in the perfect will of God always come from Judah because Saul was not from Judah which was a permissive way everybody okay so he looked he said wait a minute this is a presidential lineage I got the president himself the hand man let me have your signature and the Signet in the Old Testament they use it for signature everybody okay look what she's pulling from Judah he said give me your signal instead of stopping there she goes she say and you're bracelet laughs not one bracelet plural so maybe Judah have one here and the other one in other words the woman is stripping Judah of all power everybody okay he says and your stars deceptive the scepter of Judah and your stuff that is in your hand and he gave it here what was in this woman that Judah is willing to sacrifice all these Jews who made it happen and he gave her hair and he came into her and she did what conceived by him so the woman was in her mating season or in the time of reconception Judah never move anytime only at the appointed time Judah move who was working on this everybody okay One Time Boom the pregnancy now she doesn't have not only the Signet not only the staff not only the bracelet but the very seed the very child of Judah not the child of the child of Judah no Direct everybody okay everybody okay job to verse 24 glory to God and he came to pass about three months after that he was told Judah so everybody have the FBI this one FBI this one I don't know if kjb whatever they have on both sides they were working together everybody okay right and he came to pass about three months after Daddy was told Judas saying temer your daughter-in-law has played the water hold it and also behold she is with a child by what hold on and Judah said bring hey in other words praise be today when they told Judah instead of Judah being sad Judah jump he said glory to God I know this woman was a bad woman that's why my first son died my second die thank God I didn't give her my third one bring her here so we burn her she killed two of my sons but we know according to the scripture he was God that killed them because they were Wicked you know that you can go read it at home and then he said temper your daughter has pleased she's a Jew that say bring her forth and let her be what burn verse 25 when she was brought forth she sent to her father-in-law

Facebook some of you will be on Facebook saying he's a bad Christian because he do me good he did me bad you will convince everybody that's a bad man that's a bad man that's a bad man that's a bad man everybody okay that's the purpose of God according to what election my water stand not of water works but of him that did whatever it is said to her the Elder shall do water serve the younger as it is written Jacob from one father have I done what loved but if so have I done what I hate it how many fathers produce these two children coming from one father is not a guarantee you didn't get me having one mama and one father it's not a guarantee the Bible said Rebecca was virgin it's not a guarantee the baby that came there two of them only one but Esau could brag my mother was in a message my mother was married by Revelation watch out watch out watch out God doesn't have grandkids [Applause] everybody okay my daddy was in a message watch out make sure damn in you you get what is needed if not you're gonna be disappointed let's go to Ephesian one then we pray father help me oh God Ephesian one verse three if you're there you can say amen amen the Bible says blessed be the god of our father the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessing blessings in Heavenly places in water Christ according as he has chosen Us in him not in your father you were not chosen in your father you were chosen in God when before the foundation of the what my brother world that we should be how holy and without water blame before him in water love having done water predestinated us to the adoption of children by who Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of water his will he has nothing to do with your father as much as we appreciate our father to be believer he has nothing to do with your father Lord help me jump to verse 11. in homework so we have obtained water inheritance being water we Destiny how according to the purpose of him who does what works all things Echo after the water Council of his own water will so no matter what is happening somebody got everything under control and he's doing things according to his choosing even if you hurt me it depends on what God see for me [Applause] even if you love me it depends on what God see for me you may love me as much as you want if God doesn't do the same you might hate me as much as you want if God doesn't see the same amen if God loved me you're gonna be in trouble [Applause] there it is everybody good let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father this morning Lord thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father I commit myself and this congregation unto the hand and those that are streaming Lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children in Jesus precious name amen my subject this morning yes is the four phases of roof the theophany and the power of the seed everybody okay the theophany and the power of the seed everybody okay we are in the threshing floor we're going back and forth between roof chapter 3 and roof chapter four because when Ruth came into Israel even though she was living in Israel she was not yet into the congregation of Israel she was just a stranger in the land of Israel everybody good but in between roof chapter 3 after midnight and Ruth chapter four when the work of redemption is completed among the Elder now roof was legally everybody okay recognize as a citizenship as a citizen of the nation of Israel in other words Israel became a nation of roof even though Israel was already a nation of roof by her choosing that's right because roof say my people your people will be my people your God will be my god when you die I will do what when they bury you I will do water she already expressed that but it was not sanctioned yet you have to be sanctioned by the work of redemption before their Elder was it sanctioned then Ruth brought the baby Obed you saw him in the genealogy everybody okay what we are talking about in the Tabernacle is that God open a way that a Believer who cannot access the presence of God can go through steps until he can give access to the glory of God because all have sinned [Music] they were short of the glory of who God but because of Calvary the right of the temple the veil was rented into country opened the way so that we can get access to the Living God and once you are in his presence he begin to prepare you for the going away which is called The Rapture but this morning we are entering the abstiophany and the power of the seed what is going on with this seed last Sunday we found out that that seed amen amen is really called a thought everybody okay and that thought brother called that the word amen because what the problem said we do not believe in the pre-existence of Souls everybody okay a soul is created but I'm saying what pre-existed what always existed of you is the word or the thought or the seed everybody okay everybody okay brother Branham says this as a recapitulation he says that leader is sad of the inside that is why you ought to start which is called your water so then you come from that you are a water spirit and then you become a what a living being and we found out that when God creates you amen God started with you as a soul everybody good this has a beginning everybody okay and everything that has a beginning has a water and then from a soul God gives you a human Spirit remember last Sunday amen because you are human being then from a human being God gives you a body or a flesh amen so that the spirit can dwell into the body because James say the body without the spirit is what everybody okay we've seen before that these two components amen is the invisible you everybody okay it is called The Inside Man Paul also called that the enemy everybody okay and this which is called the body this is the visible part of you which is the outside man amen so the body that we have that we see one another this morning is only a contender only a vehicle only a government that the spiritual man will enter in everybody okay but all of this is not eternal glory to God everybody okay but now brother brought them say they you that always existed is not this one because this one is created this one is created this one you gotta wait till your mother and your father are married for you to get it everybody okay everybody good but the you that always existed is the word or the seed of their thoughts are the attribute it's saying the same thing everybody okay being the word because this spiritual man here amen this is the natural man everybody clear because this spiritual man must have a body to live on amen the word also must have also its own body that's why brother Branham in the message who is Melissa they can give it to you brother Branham said that to your funny is the word body amen you remember that brother Branham said that to your family is the word body in other words that you're funny is the body that is there to receive the word is amen let me start it again this one is a body the body of the word the body of the seed the body of the thought the body of the attribute because the correct way is you must go from the word to the tea of honey then you get into flesh these two things here are eternal [Music] everybody okay According to second Corinthians to your funny are in heaven they are eternal according to the seed by the Branham the word you who are eternal everybody okay what happened because we bypass our tea often we saw three rings everybody remember you got the body here I'm right here we got the spirit here everybody there and we got the soul there everybody there then in the soul here because you bypass your theophany everybody okay you were supposed to go this way because you didn't go this way God take you and put you right here again that's right as a seed or a germ everybody good so far in the Tabernacle we see you as a body which is the other court we see you as the holy place and we see you as the holiest and by the badam said this is the soul this is the spirit and this is the body amen and we found out last Sunday that you have an ark of the covenant here and the Ark has a throne right here where God will come and sit on this Throne everybody okay so far this is very important because it goes with the new birth we found out on Sunday that when God getting you or when God come in the Tabernacle he's looking for his seat he's looking for his turn and if God doesn't find his throne amen God will get into you and come out well this is gonna be difficult everybody okay but you need to bear with me everybody good everybody good you follow me carefully your boss just dropped me this you got two men they all have three compartment they got a body they got a spirit and they got a soul everybody okay you got a second man who got the same thing they got a body they got the spirit and they got a soul everybody okay this man have the Ark of the Covenant everybody okay and on top of the Ark of the Covenant you got The Mercy Seat which brother Branham say it's a throne it is the seat that the pillar of fire enter and goes secretary everybody okay what happened follow me carefully please when God comes are you following me and begin to enter your Tabernacle you following me if God gets access right here to your first compartment you following me you get a new heart we already went through that it's ready everybody okay when God moves into the second compartment you following me you get a new spirit you need to understand the new birth everybody okay everybody okay this is very difficult please pay attention this man also when God enter him he can get a new heart you are above equal I'm gonna go slow when God enter here this man can get a new spirit everybody okay everybody okay when God moved from this man into this man you following me this man gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost please I beg you I beg you follow me he get the baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody care where in the soul this is the biggest issue in this message when the Holy Ghost get here you follow me this man also get the baptism of the Holy Ghost I am trying everybody care everybody care and when you look at this man and this man they are all the same he got a new heart he got a new heart he got a new spirit he got a new spirit please if you're sleeping Shake yourself up when God entered this Soul this all get the baptism of the water Holy Ghost when God gets in this Soul this Soul also get water baptism of the Holy Ghost but here is the difference are you following me here is the difference when did this man get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're following me the holy ghost that entered this man never leave out [Applause] let me lay it down I got back up I got quote everybody okay when this man get the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will get into him but he doesn't see anywhere to put the ankle [Applause] do you follow me then the Holy Ghost will leave because there is no throne and the Holy Ghost come out but he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he will not produce their life [Applause] Have I Lost You please give me time that's why you see people going through emotion in the message but there is no changes 20 years there's no change we gotta know what is in you [Applause] everybody okay because what is inside is a germ seed you need to be quickened when it's quickened it will begin to grow and produce a Son of God are a daughter of God [Applause] father help me brother Branham say you can't think with your body you think with your what mine in there there is this there is where too many of Christians only do what stuff and they can just like a corn in the field and the weed in the field they can be anointed are you following me with the same water Holy Spirit that's the real believer is what Anointed with you need to be careful in this message [Applause] the Holy Ghost can do the same thing on you that he does to the other person everybody okay but the problem goes now but down on the water inside of that what the problem say the problem is what is in the soul father Stephen you're saying somebody receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost hold on he said but down on the water inside of that the north next wheel which is the third way and the third worm is water in the Tabernacle it is the holiest is the water so and that is predestinated by who God there is what the water will see germs is in there so you can receive the holy ghost in your flesh no problem you can receive the Holy Ghost going through your spirit no problem you can even have the Holy Ghost in your soul is still not enough the soul must have the seed of life [Applause] if there is no seed of life that baptism will do you nothing [Applause] that's the truth Have I Lost You William Marion Branham oh God help me Father brother Bonham say you can be anointed where out here in the water spirit and the desire and do all desire the water things but when it comes to this type of that to that word [Music] what is the word seed you shall never move from water there is it can be outside of that regardless of what you do you are still lost message believe and wake up what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost 1965 after the seals brother Branham saying you can be anointed he can get into that but if there is nothing there in other words they predestinated seed is a catch for the Holy Ghost I don't know if you get me if the Holy Ghost get into you you must have a goalkeeper amen as soon as the Holy Ghost come they predestined the seed get him and don't let him go Holy Ghost this is your house you gonna stay here you're not going nowhere [Applause] [Music] what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why brother Branham said justification make way to water scientification sanctification make white water and the baptism of the Holy Ghost make white water holy ghosts itself the Holy Ghost himself everybody okay you can chew me to my friend you can shoot me to my friend if you stay in tune God will give you the Holy Ghost without me laying hand on you because the Holy Ghost when he came in the Gentile the first time nobody lay hand on them at the preaching of the word the Holy Spirit baptized the people [Music] why do we have so much missing the message can I continue brother Barnum say they allowed this in churches naked blind and what miserable don't even know follow me carefully I beg you it is that anointed Anointed with the water real Spirit the Holy Spirit can fall Upon A man in water his Spirit but his soul is his water that jam is the what word the Holy Spirit does and look for you the holy spirit is looking for the you that is inside if that you is not there everybody okay but the problem say I don't care how much you can do and preach how well you do this how much you can water love [Applause] I love God I love God I love God we don't care how much you can love Jesus loved the rich young woman but he went to hell [Applause] I hope whoever is missing today will be listening to this because we got to the time that Jesus is coming we must go in the Rapture I don't want to stay here one of this day you're gonna come you won't see me preaching just know I'm already gone you will have service yourself you will keep this building yourself I will be gone everybody will care everybody okay if you want to hold on to the building that's your problem when Jesus come and leave everything you will find a new pastor not me [Applause] so if you're playing around with church now that's your problem that is one of the inlet of the water spirit you can love with that with your water body you love with your water spirit that is one of the water inlet and you can laugh are you ready and even love good God and still not be water why how can you love God and being but not right I'm giving you time so you can swallow how can you love God and you're not right oh brother Stephen he's a good singer he said he love God ah because he told you I love God because he's singing I love God you can even love who God and still not be water why you can cast out what devils and do what preach and do this thing and still not be what why Jesus said so he said many will come in that day that word is the seed thank you oh my god father help me glory to God he said we found today that people there is many people that just can't believe it even Water Seven even what spirit filled people I'm going to give you one brother Kalima that's how to watch what is he brother Branham they brought this mouth the water Holy Ghost doesn't mean you are water going in let's stop right there if I didn't show you this how are you going to understand this quote we're telling people they need to be baptized with the Holy Ghost a preacher comes and give you this how are you gonna know it if I didn't show you that why is brother Branham saying that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and be lost when we tell you if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you go into the Rapture is where the brand I'm contradicting push the break on the prophet everybody okay why remember what I showed you the Holy Ghost can get here he can get here he can baptize you but even though he baptized you when he baptized baptism is like they're putting you under in other words the Holy Ghost is taking over your soul when he enter your soul he's inspecting the soul he's looking for something and then over there you might be rolling on the floor and everything that's not a problem if that seed is not there the Holy Ghost will go back again slowly and pull from your spirit and pull from your body and say this is not my child and tomorrow you wake up you go and your life doesn't change everybody okay because baptized baptized the difference is there that's why brother Branham is saying you can get baptized and still be lost why because there is nothing how do I know something is in me can I continue spoken with you grown up my friend you got a true hard food okay if I give you milk you need mussels now okay uh we need to change the diet a little bit okay glory to God the baptism of the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you are water going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your what so that is the water baptism here is there is sad so in here that has to come from water God but they all then on the outside you have water five senses your body you contact your every home the inside you have water spirit and in there you have father let your conscience your love and so forth have led to the water spirit remember of God I'm fine relax my friend William Marion brother but I'm saying are you ready amen are you ready are you ready where the great singers like an Entertainer like who oh the Godfrey Arthur girlfriend and a lot of those people with their why with the wise what correct and so forth some of them

one of this day when God will speak to your theophany foreign [Applause] who is in the presence of God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my time is up can we stop [Music] laughs let me see where to land everybody okay everybody okay we talking about the seed where is the seed in the scripture amen where is the word seed in the scripture amen because the Bible and the message are what one so if brother Branham used the word seed somehow and brother Branham said the seed is what everybody okay let's go to description glory to God in Luke 8. if I can't get where I am I have to change the title look at verse 1 now the parable is this but I have to come back to that Judah probably you might have to leave that over there down there now the parable is this the seed is the water word of God everybody okay brother Brandon said the seed was water the word what do you see the word means when we say it's attribute what does he mean attribute means it is something that cannot be separated it is inseparable property I don't know if you get me I don't know if you get me do you follow me an attribute is something that is a part of something amen you cannot talk about that thing without the attribute everybody okay everybody okay there are people sitting in this church that knew me alone they are here sitting in this church when they saw me they knew me alone is there huh but the Robert is there when they saw me I was alone and I was a little bit skinnier everybody okay everybody okay when you say to them brother Stephen they will always look at one person amen if you ask them who's Brother Stephen they say yes he's a tall guy he's this this that's all if they can go further they can talk about maybe my father maybe my mom or something like that that's it amen but they didn't know my attribute everybody okay when I was talking to them I had my attribute [Applause] you don't understand me everybody okay when I was going to school my attribute was there when I was drinking milk from the breast of my mother my attribute was there I don't know if you're getting me amen the people that are coming maybe brother John Paul they over there amen they didn't know that me I was a father of Isaac if you ask him who was brother Stephen in 2019 whatever he would tell you he was just brother Stephen but they didn't know in me was my son enemy was my daughter in me was another son all the son were with me [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay when God was burying me from the accident he was not me alone [Applause] God was fearing me and my tribute [Applause] amen I don't know if you get me I don't know if you get me everybody okay I bear I carried my attribute more than my wife [Applause] my wife carried them for eight and nine months I have them all the time [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so when they come out of me you can never separate them for me you can never talk about me without talking about them they are inseparable they are very keen their bloodline is me that's why brother Branham said don't talk about my children [Applause] everybody okay if you touch them you touch me [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay from now on my story change I am no longer the brother Stephen that you know I am a brother Stephen plasma attribute and my wife also came from me [Applause] so my wife was in me my children were with me I carry my wife before the foundation of the world [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay and we we were the attribute of God when God was eternal we were in God [Applause] before God became Jesus Christ we were in God we were in Melchizedek you cannot preach this message without me you cannot talk about Jesus without me [Applause] and Jesus are acceptable [Applause] to God's water said what tribulation sickness coronavirus disappointment nothing shall be able to separately some water [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you don't know who you are you don't know who you are sauce that's why God will never rest if you are not what he wants you to be yes God will never rest if you don't you're not what he wants you to be [Music] Jesus say I have to stop if you who are bad you know how to give good thing to your water how much more how much more your water should we be give the water [Applause] give the water Holy Spirit give the water Holy Spirit Jesus said who of you if your child asks you a bread are you going to give him any kind of thing so if you who are bad [Music] what do you think about me what do you think I came down to do I came to seek for the lordship I'm looking for my children when the disciple came they begin to rejoice when they cast that devil Jesus said do not reject for that because many will come in my name Rejoice if you are hey [Applause] let me give you the scripture we gotta stop everybody okay everybody okay I don't know the Bible says in Matthew 13 here said and say unto them he does soweth the water The Good Seed is the Hope son of man they feel this the water well and the water good seed all the what the children of the Kingdom we are not seed we are good yes I don't know if you're kidding me you are not just a see but you are water a good seed [Music] do you know what he means do you know what it means do you know what good mean one day the Rich Young Ruler came to see Jesus he said good master and Jesus said no one is good but who God

gonna finish the other scripture later let's stop here because there is more there okay there's more there but at least you got two of them no let me finish the third so this slide is done and then we have to move with the other scripture Jesus said in John 12 24 verily verily I say unto you except the corn of what we who was that corn of wheat in other words Jesus himself is a seed [Applause] if
