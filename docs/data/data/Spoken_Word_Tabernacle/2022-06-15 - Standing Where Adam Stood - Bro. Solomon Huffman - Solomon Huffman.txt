out of your mouth you know i know sometimes we as humans we we say things and uh we shouldn't be saying those things you know if we can't be positive we shouldn't say it right and you know because we are what we speak you know so so let's go before the lord father we just come before you lord once again father here we are gather together in this place that you've given to us lord lord we not come to see one another although we enjoy we enjoy those things lord we we haven't come to hear from a man but lord we come to hear from you and lord if you don't come and speak the gathering here is in vain lord for that's the only purpose that we gather here lord and lord we talking this afternoon with brother sam there we talking about you know what what's wrong with you people all you look forward to is going to church you know and then when you go to church you sit there for two or three hours and you know and and after three hours you want more says what what's the matter with you you

lord and lord these prayer requests i can't remember all the names but lord you know every one of them father you have seen the names that were spoken tonight lord before the foundation of the world father you see every situation lord every need that is uh present lord in this place father and we just asked you lord lord we were as the prophet said we're not going to speak it in your name anymore but we're going to speak it according to our revelation and lord that's that's a heavy statement for a human to make but lord you told us that when we speak it's like deity speaking and father we believe that lord so we speak healing fathers to these requests father let the word go forth from this place here and go to every one of those requests that were made and find a resting place lord we believe it father because you told us to speak it father not to pray about it but to speak it not to fast about it but to speak it lord and that's what we believe father and that's what we stand upon now lord we commit the rest of this service into your hands father knowing lord at this time was that you've seen it before the foundation of the world and father we just rest in that and lord we just committed into your hands bless the speaker lord and lord bless the hearer father may we pull upon that gift that you have placed in your servant father and pull out everything that's in him father

hamilton and the family they are streaming to the best of my understanding they should be streaming but they need to stay home for coffee one was tested so they need to stay five days quarantine or home so keep them in prayer so the lord's strengthened everybody is doing good so they just have to follow the protocol that's it amen so you keep him in prayer also it's a prayer request and it's also a praise report brother miki called me last night he had to be taken to the emergency room for a hernia so they have to perform the surgery this morning if i'm not mistaken so he went through the surgery we prayed for him last night we prayed for him also today before the surgery so everything went well he's home already dismissed from the hospital so continue to praise for a quick recovery so everything he'll perfectly amen i told him the devil just gave him a uh a praise report for sister lisa graduate and the uh the god gave him a praise report for sisterly the holy spirit is here god gave them a praise report for sister lisa who graduated and here the devil is attacking trying to bring sorrow but through it all everything worked together for good he's at home and he's doing great amen blessed be the name of the lord so continue to pray for him lord's willing remember this saturday we have our meeting it's going to be in the church here at 2 30. so the last question to be dropped is tonight so don't send questions tomorrow morning you are late if you send it it's okay but it's gonna be for probably the next meeting amen for the youth banquet those that are going i need these form as soon as possible if you have not filled up your form please do it i have to scan everything and send it and just there is not one copy it's two copy you have the first one and the second one so somebody fill out only one and they forgot the second one so if you did go back again and make sure you fill two copies so we can scan them and send them up amen blessed be the name of the lord that one is covered how many are happy and understand the sabbath now [Laughter] you understand that now i didn't even know that somebody put like two or three questions about the sabbath in the question box i just saw it tonight when i opened up it was like three questions that were already placed in the box so that person is receiving his answers a little bit later amen the subject is huge because he opened up pretty big and this morning again when i was looking at that look you open up again so let's just uh stay in prayer and we're going to dig deep into the world amen we need to get all the clarification and you will understand why you have to be on church on sunday i want to go through the scripture and through the message amen you will understand why do we worship on sunday all of them are connected line up like this it's like like a chain like a casket one revelation after the other i say my god this is so beautiful amen blessed be the name of the lord tonight we have brother solomon hoffman who's preaching for us he's one of the minister with brother josh bennett he'd been in our church when we were in a hotel if you recall he came with brother tim cross when he preached so he's a wonderful minister a wonderful young man and his wife is here sister gabrielle right she's sitting back there so sister you're not a stranger you home this is home second home if your church is closed this is a church here you can come and fellowship amen so feel at home i told him he's going to preach like home and we will pull like home amen so i hope you gave him a good meal because it's coming out amen so blessed be the name of the lord we will call brother solomon and take he need to take his liberty and preach and minister the word of god tonight amen let's sing only believe only believe all things are possible only believe [Music] all the beliefs [Music] believes we sing jesus here jesus [Music] jesus [Music] amen can you give him a hand clapping praise tonight hallelujah i mean what a paradox that is to realize that in this church building tonight that we can be in the very presence of the same jesus that walked on this earth thousands of years ago amen and to know that that's a reality tonight that he's walking in our midst and i wonder maybe before we would uh look at the word of god if we could just our heads and hearts and have a word of prayer and and just invite the lord to have preeminence in this service tonight and maybe if you have a need upon your heart if you'd like to lift your hand and ask god to remember you amen i think of what a prophet would teach us he said that prayer isn't so much as bringing god down to man but it lifts us up where he is so so let's just invite him to come lord we we stand here before your sweet presence tonight lord and lord we know now that we're in the presence of more than just one another but lord we know that we're in the presence of the the very god of this bible and lord tonight i pray lord may you just lift us up to where you are lord and may the things of this world just grow dim to us tonight lord as we look to your word lord no doubt any man could stand here and could read words off of a page but lord we know that you're so much more than just a letter on a page but father lord you're a living reality tonight lord and i pray lord may you just have the preeminence to move in this service lord to to speak words of power and deliverance lord words have changed lord and lord uh your words do so much more than words of a man lord they they go down to the very heart of a man and change what he is and i pray lord may your word just go forth in power and demonstration of the spirit of almighty god lord and lord i pray that you just anoint the little gift of god in our lives to get ourselves out of your way lord and may you anoint your children that they could hear and receive what they have need of lord and i pray that you just be a participator in this service lord we're we're not here just to let you be an onlooker lord or to let you be a spectator but lord we want you to participate tonight lord and we just give this service to you tonight lord i invite you to this pulpit lord we give the furtherness of it to you lord and we pray when we leave this building may we have a testimony that did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way we'll leave giving you praise we pray these things humbly and sincerely in your name the name of jesus christ we pray and the church said tonight amen and amen may god bless you bless you if you have your bibles i invite you to turn with us straight to the scriptures in the book of genesis and the first chapter and i'd like to say uh we certainly appreciate brother stephen the invitation to come and we we count on the great honor to stand behind this pulpit and you know i thought about what it would be like to be a pastor sometimes and you know they said and they gave up their pulpit and they set in a pew so we certainly counted the honor to be here with you and we just bring greetings from brother josh bennett our pastor back home he said to breathe sure and greet the church so we send you greetings amen we're all part of one body amen and the foot is just as important as the hand amen where we're thankful that god has let us be in his great body tonight at the book of genesis the first chapter will read the 26th verse down to the 28th we'll also read in psalms 82 and we'll turn one more place after that and genesis 1 26 the bible says the yes and god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and so god created man in his own image i want you to notice that scripture amen when god created mankind he did it in his own image and man he wasn't a wasn't a byproduct amen in other words we could say it this way he copied himself amen he made man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god bless them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply replenish the earth and subdue it and i love this part in the scripture and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth now now i want to pull something out of that notice how when god started creation he started it aiming with the dominion ship and and that that's what god put in mankind and that we'll get to that in just a bit and in psalms 82 and the sixth verse the bible says this and then jesus actually quotes the scripture uh in the new testament uh talking about how the bible said your gods in psalm 82 and 6 the bible says and i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high and also one more scripture we appreciate you standing the book of romans in the eighth chapter we'll read one verse in the 15th verse there a familiar scripture in the bible would read this for ye have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear amen don't you don't you love that we've not received the spirit of bondage so we we can say with all the surety god does not give us a spirit of bondage but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father now we just want to ask god to bless his word as you can be seated tonight and for a couple of minutes i want to be mindful of the time knowing this and wednesday night but i'd like to speak to you by the help and grace of god on the subject of standing where adam stood a man standing where adam stood and and i believe we have the ability to do that tonight amen by by the shed blood of almighty god and then and just to build a foundation in this we understand that the age that we're living in uh the prophet to our generation would call this an adoption age he would he call it a rapture age he called it a bride age an eagle age a harvest age and brother branham would use many terminologies to describe the age that we're living in he called it a capstone age and and to me when you study in the message of the hour you'll find amen the brother adam is saying that for a reason he's he's calling this age amen the bride age the adoption age the rapture rage he's calling those many different names to teach you something to let you know that the age that we're living in it is a manifestation age it says this is the capstone age this is the age of completion and and i'm thankful for a prophet that would give us a direct word i mean we didn't have to wonder if this is the manifesting age if this is the rapture age but but god's given us a message to let us know amen the time and the age that we're living in you pray you pray for my voice tonight like this past week and seem to lose it but we're just going to give the devil a black eye amen but you'd find how a prophet in our generation is declaring the age that we're living in how that this is a manifesting time i mean this is adoption time and i i love what he says here in the message the queen of the south he speaks on what amen what satan wants to do he says now i might say this just now because the holy spirit seems to be putting it on my heart he says now be careful because satan will try to tell you or something that's great off in another age to come he says there's something coming along in another revival so he's saying here it's the characteristics of satan to always put something off that that will that we're looking at something else we're looking for something else to come he says no that's what satan does he tries to put it off for another age now satan will try to tell you something some great move coming into another age he says or another coming along of another revival he says and it's always been that way but he says now now i believe that we're at the end i don't look for nothing else to come but the coming of the lord so so he's saying directly that we're in the end time amen but see satan always wants to put it off to a later age and say well we're going to come to something eventually eventually we're going to manifest being the son of god eventually we're going to be this but i just want to say tonight amen i'm not waiting to be able to stand where adam stood i'm not waiting tonight to be able to have even the same authority that adam had in the beginning i'm in church let me just say the wait is over you're living in the age where a son will manifest what he is and a donor will manifest what they are the devil's manifesting what he is but i say this i mean there's all the evil that's out there today it's manifesting what they are if you keep your eyes on it you're going to get discouraged as can be but but how about just one minute tonight let's look in the church of the living god and realize that there's some sons tonight there's some daughters tonight i know what the prophet said they're born signs they're field signs and they're speaking the word of almighty god amen manifesting exactly what we are hallelujah amen now you spare with me as we build a foundation in this but but i want to show you something very powerful in the message one that's brother brown would say this he says now it's god's purpose it's his purpose as a father supreme was to have a family now an earthly family he says an adam and eve and the only way that he could be a family with him or with that god could be a family with him he says was because god's nature was in them so the only reason that adam and eve were able to be family with god is because god's very own nature was inside of them i want you to keep that in mind so that made within with god's nature in them and then each other with god he says and they become all one isn't that a beautiful picture god in his family father over all supreme amen no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable amen never to be sick never have a heartache just one with god what a picture that's the very nature of god his very nature was in these people now now as god has created mankind i want you to notice god was determined to have a family is that right amen god was determined to have a i'm thankful tonight amen that he's let me be in his family amen as his very own son but but i want you to notice how that god was determined to do this and there was not any force there was not anything that could stop god's determination from having a family amen there's not anything that can stop god's determination i mean i just want to give you this amen god is more determined i mean than even you are tonight to have a family and i'll just say this amen god's determination will override anything you may go through because god is determined to have a family and he will have a family out of this age that we're living in amen i notice in this the book of genesis as god is creating mankind i want you to notice amen how god creates mankind in the beginning god god says in the bible let us make man in our image now now you ever study that out it's very beautiful because as god makes humanity god is making something in the fashion of him amen so you say what's that mean it's what it means i mean he made man in the fashion of him it's a being with supreme authority he's a being with dominion over everything i mean i'll just say this he was the most powerful the powerful being to walk the face of the earth was the first amen outside of adam he was the most powerful being that walked on this earth that we walk on today amen full power full dominion over everything that he's seen and known amen now i want you to notice in this the reason that god made mankind that way i mean it's because for god to have a true fellowship he i mean he must have a being that is that is like him i mean if god's gonna have true communion and true fellowship he can't have it was just a sinner he can't have it with just anybody but if god's going to have a true fellowship it's going to be with a being that is just like him amen now a prophet would teach us he covered it in the message meanness man i know he said well if you take a little girl and she wants to hang out with her grandma all the time he said well you would wonder something's wrong there maybe she's grandma's pet he said see the fellowship is not there because there's no similarity amen the fellowship's not there because there's no similarity in other words a ground to fellowship so you see a true fellowship that starts on common ground a true fellowship starts on common ground you say why are you saying that's what i'm saying i mean for god to have true fellowship and with a human they're going to have to be on the same ground that almighty god is on and when god created adam he was on the same ground as god he was all-powerful he was god over the earth and god can come down in the cool of the evening and battleship wisdom and adam understood god and god understood at him because he was like god i'm going to get ahead of myself and go ahead and say in this generation god is finally able again to come down in the cold of the evening just like he did with adam and eve and we're a bride with the eden fellowship just like it was in the beginning god used to couldn't do this but now he can i mean listen church and you should not be able to do this but after we've been restored to everything that was lost in the beginning the heart of god can now be satisfied once again like it was in the beginning hallelujah amen true fellowship starts on common ground now i want you to notice something in this i mean because there was a difference from adam being a created being and then when god breathed the breath of life into adam now there's a quote here in questions and answers very very amazing i see a lot of beautiful types in this but but says this now i can see adam he says let's take this away i see him standing like a tree now god made him notice this he was dead as he could be his toes were like roots in the ground and god said let there be or he breathed the breath of life into him and then adam jumped he came to himself see he breathed the breath of life into him and he became a living soul so i want you to notice this god created him and a prophet is saying he's dead as dead can be without the breath of almighty god in him so you see fellowship fellowship could not come while adam was dead but see when god breathed his life into adam he could be in fellowship with god or church you see the importance of the holy ghost you want to fellowship with god tonight then get the holy ghost amen you want to commune with the king tonight then get the holy ghost there's not a way around it hallelujah amen there was no fellowship until adam had god's breath in him i mean how could god have amen how could god have true fellowship with something dead god can't god can't have true fellowship with something that the only way that he can have true fellowship is with something that has his life on the inside of it hallelujah that's the same for the believer in the message what is the holy ghost the prophet would teach it he was saying now the first place is a christian that professed to be a christian but if that christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost he's only in process of being a christian he ain't doing away with it but he says you're only in the process until you receive the holy ghost he says see he's professed to believe it he's working to it but god has not yet given him amen the holy ghost so you see you must receive the holy ghost if you're going to stand where adam stood i want to say this god made a way that we can stand where adam stood came him by the gift of the holy ghost amen god especially upon adam he breathed the breath of eternal life and then he became an eternal person with god and blasphemous names but amen say this now a church born of the breath of god he says now when that statue has molded itself up there in condition god's breath breathes upon them the prophet would say this receive the holy ghost he says a man you're a son of god now you can join anything you want to you've been born in the church he said but you must be born by the breath of god and god weeped upon them and said receive ye the holy ghost oh my there you are so a prophet's directly saying there ain't no way around it we must receive the breath of god and the thing i love about god he don't deal with the believer one way and do it's another a totally different way amen i just want to say this i'm in the very same breath that god breathed in adam is the same breath that is going through this building tonight it's the same breath of almighty god that can feel an earthen vessel just like it did adam in the beginning i want to say you may be as dead as adam was but all you need tonight is the breath of god aiming to bring life into you in order to have the breath of god i mean you desire it tonight i mean i believe it's for you i mean i i want you to notice something in this amen i want you to know it's the life that adam lived after receiving the breath of god now now continuing on their blasphemous things the prophet would say this now he had power like god he was an amateur god he was god of the earth not god of heaven now but he was god of the earth and someday the sons of god will become gods jesus said so this is not written in your law your gods amen someday the sons of god will become gods now he says here now we're going to get into something deep just watch this when we drive it down amen he's saying we're going to get into something deep i mean to show the believer's position as being a son of almighty god as being a daughter of almighty god now now it's amazing to realize that the same life that god was in the beginning he didn't get a different life when he put in an atom he didn't get a different breath he didn't get a different spirit but god put his own life into adam he didn't use something else he used his very own life when he was gonna go put it now now it's amazing to realize that amen because god puts everything out of money i mean god god puts his own faith in adam he puts his own power in adam amen everything god is he's putting inside his son by the gift of the holy ghost now now here's what's powerful i mean because the same god that used his very own faith to speak adam into existence he now takes that same faith and he puts it in adam adam i'm not giving you a different faith i'm giving you my faith and my power and every believer in here tonight god has given you the faith of almighty god it's not a different faith tonight but the same thing i spoke and said let there be is the same faith that is in the church of the living god hallelujah he didn't put a different life and adam and put a different spirit he put his very own spirit because he wanted fellowship he wanted communion and the only way to do that was to have somebody just like him hallelujah the only way to do that was to have somebody just like him i mean i noticed that state that adam is in as the bible says that you'll have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over everything that moveth upon the earth so as god is positioning his firstborn son adam i i just love how god does things don't you amen god god puts him as the highest power upon the face of the earth i mean adam go out there brother kelly with supreme dominion there was not anything that was above adam there wasn't a beast of the field a fish of the sea mountain was above that son of god i mean nothing was above him nothing was about him tell your neighbor nothing was above him you say why does that make you happy because god almighty put that same breath in these lungs and nothing tonight is about the church of the living god there's not a spirit in hell that is above you tonight amen god has given you the same dominion as adam had in the beginning glory to god now that word dominion there means having dominion over exercising worship to be lord to be lord or rule have dominion over a supreme ruler and king i mean to have power i mean that's the way that god started it and how many knows that the prophet would teach us we're going back to the beginning we're going back to the beginning i mean just as god had it perfected in the beginning we are going back to where adam stood i remember you go with me tonight and let's go stand where adam stood as sons and daughters of god you say can we do it bro solomon amen can we stand where adam stood god has made a way for you tonight amen the youngest person in here god has made it possible for you to stand where adam stood [Applause] the most powerful being by the kelly the most powerful being to walk the earth and i want to say this i'm going to go out on a limb and i'm going to say it you are the most powerful beings that walk the face of this green planet you're the most powerful being now the devil hates this but i'm going to keep on going with the most powerful being to walk the face of this earth there ain't nothing above you there ain't nothing more powerful i just saw the teaching of the prophet what he would say he said who has more power an angel in heaven or a son of god on the earth the angels are jealous of your position the angels are jealous of your authority as a son of god you've got a position brother that out does the angels you've got a position that out does the angels in heaven oh god it's a god-given position and the beautiful thing about it is as we didn't put ourselves here i didn't position myself come on you didn't position yourself but god positioned you i say let's stand where god has positioned us as sons and daughters of god yes sir they might tell you i love looking at the life of adam i mean i want you to know it's the way he lived do you think adam didn't have freedom do you think adam didn't have liberty to go into the garden of eden in the core of the evening and come fellowship with god do you think adam didn't have liberty to worship liberty to praise do you think adam didn't have freedom you think adam could not exercise his right as a son of god i says whenever adam wanted to he could go and exercise his wife as a son of god and say mountain i don't like where you're at be moved heal i don't like where you're at be moved and he didn't doubt it was a shimbo he knew his position he didn't have to go take a note pill and then go speak the word that he knew his god-given position and when the need was there when the need was there he spoke to it it's time the sons of god speak into your mountain speak under your storm speak under your battle hallelujah speak the word god will perform it it's just covering it with you and it can never fail hallelujah i'll say this if you trust god on your position you're not going to fail you're not going to fail let's stand in our position tonight as sons and daughters of god listen let me give you a word you're not going to fail you're placed on a rock a solid rock and you're not going to fail i'll say this right first eve in the beginning she was able to fail and she failed but this church there ain't no fail in you and you're not able to fail because god has positioned you hallelujah amen adam adam didn't stand there with no condemnation he never stood there with no guilt he never stood there as a slave to sin he never stood there as a slave to pornography come on he never stood there as a slave to anxiety he never stood there as a slave to nervousness a slave to fear he never stayed in that position because he knew he was and he knew he didn't have to put up with it you don't have to put up with it tonight hallelujah you'll have to put up with it tonight let's stand like adam stood and receive your god-given heritage i mean the beautiful thing about this is adam conducted himself like a son i i love the story of a prophet don't you he he tell us some stories for a reason you know but he told that story of that slave boy beautiful story he was a slave and a man came by to go by slaves and so he said how come this one acts a little bit different how come you don't act like you're right you you feed them different you treat them different no we don't why is he special we don't really know so i'll go ask him myself so he went and asked him he said well sir well sir you see they don't treat me no different i don't get better treatment i work nine to five like everybody else i go to college just like everybody else i go to work just like everybody else but see in a land far away from here that's really only but 20 feet from where i'm standing a land far away my father's a king and i know he's a king so when i act i act like a king when i talk i talk like a king when i work i work like a king when i go to school i act like a king everywhere i go i am the son of a king every place that i go not just in church not just for meetings but everywhere i go i am the son of the king i'm no longer the son of charles and ella branham i am identified with my king hallelujah knew who he was the message adoption the prophet would say this way he said now this may choke you to death but did you know that men that are sons of god they are amateur gods how many ever knew that how many knew jesus said so he said see they had full domain over the dominion of the world he gave them dominion over all things everything everything you have dominion over everything not just some things everything not just some sins every sin you have dominion over it you have dominion over it he had full domain over the world he said but see he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god who will come back who will come back and take it over again talk about a takeover you'll take it over again he said we're waiting for that fullness of time pyramid gets to the top when the full sons of god will be manifested and have the power of god to walk out and take every power that satan has away from him extra extra the wait is over there is a bride there's been churches churches brides brides but i'm looking at a bride here tonight we're not waiting to manifest it we're not waiting to become it but we are i say what the prophet said we are right now sons of god daughters of god i say this we're acting like it oh but preacher bless god when i get into the millennium i'll exercise my right as a son when i get to the millennium brother i will exercise my right to put sin under my feet oh preacher when i get to the millennium i'm going to claim my family when i get to the millennium preacher i'm really going to be a son of god that's hogwash you are right now a son of god we're not waiting to the comment stop letting the devil put it in the future we are right now sons and daughters of the almighty god hey we ain't waiting from it we're not waiting for it i love the scripture in romans for sin shall not dominion over you say it with me sin shall not have dominion over you record another scripture the scriptures of god i mean the word i can't quantify my mind it's what it says amen that the scripture cannot be broken that correct scripture cannot be broken he said why are you tying those two together this is why because if god told me that god told me that there ain't no sin that will have dominion over my life and he also said that my scriptures cannot be broken for sin to have dominion over this boy out here god will have to break his own word but scriptures cannot be broken tonight and sin shall not have dominion over you i mean god would have to break his own word if sin is going to have dominion over this bride come on somebody god will have to break his very own word if sin is going to have dominion over you in other words it just isn't possible it is just not able to happen my the position of standing as a son of god you say well preacher you seem to be playing you see you seem to make it seem like we got a whole lot of power [Music] this guy's got no power this guy has no power you remember someone you think in yourself you're going to make it absolutely not this flash is rotten as rotten can be he's dead is that i mean i'll say what the bible said there ain't no good thing in this flesh but see my confidence has went beyond the god in the mirror my confidence has went beyond the god in the mirror brother sister i've looked beyond this fellow flesh and i see the same breath that was breathed and towed and i see it living in me brother and that same light from god is gonna go back to god hallelujah we had no faith in ourselves but i got faith in my position i got faith in my new birth i've got faith in the holy ghost god gave me hallelujah amen adam could stand there and say let this mountain be moved and it would do it let this tree be moved and it would happen and then church you you realize a position you stand in it it's time to re-speak the word of god you got a devil amen come on i know you got a devil word against you speak unto it the word is in your mouth speak unto it that there's a devil of fear leaning around you speak under that thing if he's ruining your marriage speak unto it that that sickness has taken hold over you speak unto it you say preacher you you really mean the power of the spoken word is in the bride absolutely the power of the spoken word lays in you yes sir amen adam could stand with an authority in knowing his position hey man he didn't have to cry about it he didn't have to worry about it amen adam didn't have to go run in the closet and go cry god why are things this way why is this why is this why is this this way he didn't have to go around and cry about it and you want to know why if he went and cried about it god would have came to him just like he did to moses why are you crying why are you crying church why are you crying why are you crying moses speak my word this is not the hour to be a bunch of crybabies this is the hour that we speak the word of god and watch him perform it why cry adam speak hallelujah a message is such a communion that adam had with god in fact god said adam here's what i want you to do i'm going to line up all the animals animals before you i want you to name them so i did what god said amen animals stopped going by adam one by one elephant giraffe rabbit mouse and god would say son that's exactly what i would have painted [Music] that's exactly what i was thinking [Music] you see the reason why and because the very life of that creator [Music] i'm just going to go a little step in this why did god come to our prophets when them two young people was there in a meeting acting all indecent i can sinful in a meeting and god said son whatever you speak what you say is what will happen and so i said i forgive you why did he do it why could he forgive when there shouldn't have been none because the very life the very forgiveness that was in that creator stepped into a man and he exercised his authority as a son of god why could he stand on colorado hill [Music] how could he stand on colorado hill here comes a here comes a sign and a storm coming by he stands there in the age that you and i are living in he's a flesh man like you and me is that okay flesh man like you and me i i just won't quote what he's saying he said this about preachers and about men he said a lot of people think that you're some kind of payment spectacular peculiar holy person he said men of god are just like anybody else they're not some odd really strange person they're just like you and i and a man just like you and i stood up on that hill and one of the greatest storms that's getting ready to blow by and he stands there as a son of god amen exercising his rights as a son of god and he says storm amen go back that way for what was it three days and would you believe it this storm had to obey the voice of a son of god glory to god amen and the storms of your life they have to obey the voice of a son and the voice of a daughter he said preacher will happen it's gotta happen because you are a son you are a daughter and in the age we live in god would use a man as a banner maker said okay he'd bring a man to a standard and when waving before the people this is what is possible this is what is possible if you stand in your position you can speak to the cancer can speak to the cancers you can speak to the tv you can speak to the blinded eyes the same power the same authority the same dominion is in the bride of jesus christ it's not a different life it's not a different spirit it's the same breath of god that breathed in the beginning same lines same authority same dominion hallelujah i want you to notice something in this in the book of isaiah 14 the prophet isaiah gives us some insight on our adversary the devil hey speak something about him because satan has always desired to be exalted above the son of god [Music] you're right satan has always desired to be above you now y'all know what i'm talking about you'll start your day tomorrow morning and he'll be right there getting ready to battle you [Music] amen he desires your position and in isaiah 14 the prophet would say this now isaiah 14 and 13 for that has said in thy heart notice i even noticed the corruption in this being thou has said in thy heart i will ascend into the heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god a prophet would teach us a star god's a son of god i'll exalt myself above the sons of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sights of the north here we go again and i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high listening devil yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit notice something in this satan says i will i'll be lifted up i'll be exalted i'll be this god never did that god never did that amen he never exalted him he never hey he never had a position that he wanted to have i want you to notice amen he wanted to put himself in that position and it never did happen amen he never got in the position to be above the star of god he never got in the position to be just like the most high he never did do it he said it himself i will do it but see when god when god positions you you don't do it you don't position yourself i'll say this church amen god has positioned you above every devil in hell he's positioned you higher higher than every demon out of the pits of hell i have not done this he has knowledge he has positioned you tonight hallelujah that's your power power is your what position how's the governor of our state in north carolina how does he have any power his position how does the president in the white house have any power his position how does a judge have any power in a courtroom his position but see the president can't just say well blessed god i'm going to be president governor can't just say bless scotland be a governor but there's a power there's a higher power that places them in a position of power amen there's somebody above them that places them in that position of power and i just want to go on record and say this the king of kings and the lord of lords has positioned you in a seat of power a seat of authority a seed of dominion a seed of anointing he has positioned you and that's where your power is god has put you in position to receive everything that adam forfeited in the beginning i see that you're in line for everything that was lost in the beginning hallelujah i'm just going to preach for a minute and we'll just go home amen loser had his chance wesley had his chance they all had their chest but see i mean they could not even stand where you stand today is that right they could not stand where you stand today see the lord preach a message called the countdown you all heard that message powerful message and he would preach about them different ages you know amen he would talk about how they had horse and buggy and then they would advance sometimes in scientifics horse and buggy come up automobile amen a prophet would type that aiming to the church ages and they had a horse and buggy had automobile had an airplane and we all know he would top that airplane is that pentecostal age he said well sure one service they go up but the plane had to come back down [Music] on sunday they could go up but on monday had to go back down and the prophet would teach us showing the position that they stood in but a prophet of god would go a bit farther and say but now now in the age that we live in it has been the scientifics has advanced so high and so great that they can go beyond they can go beyond the control of gravity and they don't even have to come back down they don't even have to come back down but all they have to do is get in the shuttle stand in their position stand in the position and the power of that shuttle will get you higher than any hive that has ever been obtained you say appreciate what you're saying that's what i'm saying tonight and the age that you and i are living in you have the literal ability to go higher than any other age luther is jealous to see this day wesley is jealous to see this day abraham's jealous to see this day glory to god patriarchs of old are jealous to save the life that we live stand in position tonight [Applause] stand in position tonight who's that preacher well i i guess it's real hard to do that it's not see every time there'd be an advancement amen you'd always find there's less there's less effort you have to do i love this there's less effort you have to do got a horse and buggy had to get the bug he had to get the horse had to feed the horse had to water the horse get the car had to get the guys how to get the oil how to get the tires have to steer it have to break it have to gas up get the plane got to get in the plane fly under the sky come back down get the gas you got all of this work to live a up and down lifestyle you're working as hard as you can work trying to overcome trying to keep the victory trying to keep revival but god has made it to where you do not have to work for it you just have to receive it you do not have to work for your revival you just have to receive it they're about your good works no longer it ain't about your ability no longer it's about receiving what god has for you i say god i receive it in the name of the lord i heard the prophet say the other day let's stop talking about this message and let's get into it i'll say it this way this message is the shuttle to lift you up beyond the clouds beyond the solar system this will take you all the way back to the mind of almighty god it's the way back home it's the way back to stand where i've been standing and we are on our way back to where we come from in the mind of almighty god [Music] adam i'll see you soon hallelujah i'll see you soon hallelujah let's practice it what good's being a son of a king if we don't practice it what good is being a daughter of a king if you don't practice it let's practice our position your position means nothing if you're not using it i said your position means nothing if you're not using it i believe we live underneath our privileges as sons of god there should not be any devil that torments you and you let it stay there sin shall not have dominion over you sin shall not have dominion over you sin shall not have dominion over you god said so that settles it and we believe it let's march in the victory let's march in revival let's take our stand run around the walls joshua you're a son of god the walls were compiling as being a son and daughter of god hallelujah hallelujah everything god was he poured it into christ everything christ was he has poured it into you in this age that we're living in and we receive it musicians come we receive it we receive it you see what a prophet would say he said the desire of god is to take empty vessels and shake the world with them the desire of god is to take empty vessels and fill them with somebody else's spirit somebody else's life he wants hey man you see god's desire and fellowship is that right god's desire i mean the whole the whole reason we're even here today because god wants a family he wants a family let's not lose sight of that he wants a family and we must stand where adam stood had the communion that he had i want to say this the only way this will be possible is by receiving the very breath that adam's received and let's stand on our feet tonight [Applause] hallelujah and when you stand you stand tonight just as adam stood before the fall sinless virtuous bride you have dominion over all things power over all things you're the god of this earth are you hearing me queen of heaven you're the god of this earth i say it's time we reposition the devil you know what i mean amen he's see satan is so jealous of your position he wants to be exalted he wants to be above i say devil you will never have my position you will never have my position i am a son of god i am a daughter of god i i just said this just for no reason i want you to take this home with you and when the devil comes knocking on your door let them know devil i have dominion over you i have dominion over everything that you are sin has no dominion over me i've received the spirit of adoption whereby i cry abba father and let's bow our heads tonight if they can play that song i am a child of god [Music] for the night maybe if you want to lift your hand and ask god for a refilling of that very breath of god [Music] lord we come to you tonight lord no doubt every hand would be up in the building desiring a refeeling of the breath of almighty god [Music] lord you told us in your word blessed are they the hunger and thirst after righteousness you told us you shall be filled tonight lord i pray may there just be a real feeling or may your very own breath breathe upon this assembly of believers tonight lord lord breathe in these vessels give us a refilling of your spirit of god tonight we fill us lord from the top of our head to the souls of our feet lord that we may have boldness to stand like adam stood in the beginning lord give us bonus to stand like he stood back in that garden lord and i pray tonight if there be a children a child of god here tonight lord and there's a devil in their home there's a torment and spirit in their home a torment and spirit in their life lord i pray that they would stand like adam and rebuke that devil off their life who rebukes that devil out of their home rebuke that spirit of fear and bondage and guilt lord i pray they take their position tonight as sons and daughters of almighty god lord you position us tonight and we thank you for it we're honored to be positioned by the almighty god we thank you tonight bless us tonight we pray in jesus name hallelujah we sing that tonight [Music] a slave oh yes glory glory glory oh yes [Music] [Applause] oh yes we are oh you have chosen [Music] oh yes [Music] you surround me from [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you have chosen me [Music] [Applause] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] i wonder if you could do without the music this [Music] evening i am a child [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am a child for the last time i'm no longer a slave [Music] i am [Music] i am a child of god hallelujah you believe it tonight [Music] amen glory to god what a powerful message [Music] and it looks like you cut it short brother solomon amen i was expecting more and look it's till nine o'clock and you cut it short praise god my god and he cut it in a specific point and i know it's not him where he stopped that's where you're going to get on sunday amen did you see him touching the tattlet have you thought about it the holy spirit just hold it for a certain reason amen what a powerful message you must be on common ground for you to have fellowship this applied to church he applied to your friendship it applies to everything you want to have a friend make sure you're in common ground hallelujah that's why brother branham said you should have a friend that believe like you don't tell me you know more than the prophet because you will always find that brother branham is always right you can bypass him after a while you found out that brother branham was right amen because when you believe your prophet you're going to prosper even if it doesn't make sense what are you going to do if you were following moses in front of the red sea he cut it he cut it short so we still have some minute what are you gonna do if you are following moses and you are right in front of the red sea and you look behind pharaoh and the army you look over here the mountain you look over there you have the wilderness you look right straight through the red sea what are you going to say looks like god put you in a trap what you really think it's a corner in your life it is not really a corner hallelujah where you feel like the devil corner you like you can't go this way you can go this way you can go this way there is always always a provided way riding and that provided way sometimes is beyond your thinking because nobody could have thought that there was an 85 in the red sea there was an 85 right there one was going south one north and he was just covered by water you see how god does things you see how god who would have thought a crow can feed a human who would have thought then amen believe on the prophet and you will prosper amen you must have that eternal breath which is you must get into the holiest amen because god needs the same faith the same person just like him you remember on sunday when he created man he took off his gloves because what i can do that man can do exactly the same thing that's why paul said the faith that i live with it is not my faith but i live by the faith of the son of god god just gave you his faith so that you and him can fellowship there is another mystery of the holy spirit where the it's a china tab where you take a paper and you tear it down in two and you get a portion and the other one got a portion oh my god blessed be the name of the lord god wants somebody that is like him that's why we are gods amen you need to practice your position you must take it and do it and the more you do it you are engaging god amen you know in philippians chapter 2 verse 5 the bible say let this mind being you which was also in in christ jesus so you need to find what was the mind in christ jesus if that mind need to be in you you need to find what was the mind in christ that is supposed to be coming into you i love paul paul say who this is the mind that was in christ who being in the form of what who is here who is not created in the image of god show me your hand show me anybody here that is not created in the image of god genesis 1 26 the brother just preached that we were created in the image and in the likeness of god so all of you look like god and all of you are in the form of god so if you are in the form of god just like jesus was in the form of god let's see what mind do we need to have then is the scripture complicated hallelujah let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who jesus being in the form of god comma thought it not robbery to be equal with do you know what it means do you know what it means do you know why they crucified jesus right [Music] there was two reasons right i gave you the quote i already have the scripture to give it to you on sunday anybody care do you know why in other words when jesus was saying i am god in his mind he never even dared he never thinking not rubbing robbery to rob you meaning you're picking up you you're robbing somebody everybody here so when jesus is saying that i am god he is not robbing god if he is robbing god then jesus and god are two different person but me and my father we are so when i say i am god i am really god that jehovah of the old testament that's me anybody care so the bible say let that mind be also in you so where is god now you see you're still thinking twice you don't want to say this do you remember on sunday the disciples never say look on jesus you remember on sunday do you remember on sunday they say look on who why us because the mind that was in christ was now in the disciple and the disciples say look at us everybody here that's why when they were persecuting the disciple jesus never told so you are persecuting peter he never said so so why do you persecute brother robert said why do you persecute did paul meet jesus one day so where was paul touching jesus because jesus was in the can you believe that that's why the scriptures say ye are god you are the children of god the children of god means god the son of god means god i already gave you that scripture why do you think the devil was looking at jesus and say if you are the water [Music] do what take this stone and turn it to what he knew a son of god can do that everybody here he knew a son of god can do that but he want to put a doubt in jesus so if jesus doubt he's going to try to prove the devil anybody here [Music] if you do it you are doubting yourself because the devil said if if the devil would have said you the son of god change it then jesus can change it but he said if in other words i'm questioning you i want you to be trouble between you and who you are everybody okay when you got confusion between you and the real you that is god then the devil got you then you will begin to do things to prove people have you seen a homosexual they do stuff more than the one who is born naturally [Music] because they are doubting themselves their bodies telling them they're not what they are but a true woman doesn't care whether she walk like a man or whether she walk like a woman she doesn't care because she knows she's a woman if you're a true god you don't care what somebody else is saying do you get what i'm saying you don't have to worry about what people are saying anybody here they told jesus christ if you the messiah come down at the cross so we will believe you did you see him doing that because they're trying to make him prove why should i prove you me dying at the cross that's exactly what the is saying matter of fact waiting few hours i will be saying what david said i'm repeating david and they're still blind the devil will always try to bring you question between what you are here and what you really are in there if you get the two people together then you can change your world if there is a discrepancy between the two that's when you up and down you up and down you up and down but when you get there when you understand that who told you jesus didn't suffer did the suffering of jesus christ remove his deity jesus hunger did he move his deity so why when you go through trouble you begin to doubt your deity you begin to question whether you're a son of god or not because of a lot of trouble you say ah because i'm going through this headache so maybe i don't have what i'm supposed to jesus have a different way to operate he says i do nothing except that except the father shows me that's the way we operate i don't have to prove to you that i'm a son of god i am a son of god i operate when my maker tell me what to do i'm not here to prove it to you i'm just living my life when you go to walmart do you go prove something to somebody you're going for admission you're going to get your groceries and goes out you don't have to be there proving the people who you are that's exactly how you walk in this world everybody okay one quote and we go home i left today but i have it in my own my phone brother branham say whatever god does with the messenger do you know that code can you hand me my phone i don't want you to say brother stephen say brother branham say the bible says everybody here let me get it for you and then you go home amen what a powerful message brother branham said this and discomfort is not for the servant church age messenger only every true believer is in the hand of god and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that god is to the believer everybody okay he say what god gives the messenger karma and how he blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body my messenger is not looter my messenger is not wesley my messenger is not seymour my messenger is william marion branham so whatever god did to brother branham is an example to me anybody here whatever god was doing in elijah was only an example for elisha matter of fact elijah b double where is the god of elijah where is the god of william marion branham simple as it is remember who you are you must act on your position and begin to behave like a son of king like a child of the king talk like a king by the solomon god richly bless you that's a machine gun amen let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for this powerful message that have uplifted your children giving them strength removing all the smokes that the devil was trying to bring in their life to question their mind to bring confusion and uncertainty because of the little trial they're going through lord [Music] father you went to the greatest trial that anybody here can go through you took the sick seal completely it struck you on the cross so that we can never experience the tribulation period we can never experience calvary in a literal way you took all of it upon you and you made a way so that today further we can go back lord to where adam stood father adam left the garden of eden with a flaming sword turning everywhere and the caribbean blocking the way even the law was not able to open the way but father you came down in the flesh [Music] and through your flesh you open a new way and you split that veil completely and now the caribbean that we're guarding blocking the way to the tree of life these caribbean are working towards the edges to bring your children your children back again to the tree of life and no wonder in the church ages we have a reward for a tree of life because you say that blessed is he that do your commandment for they will have a right to the tree of life father we thank you for restoring us back to this father throughout the years minister has preached on these things we heard it left and right we are back to what adam lost but lord let this be a reality because there is absolutely no way that the world can manifest their position and your children cannot manifest their position if the chief the world is climbing so high in sin father it's a sign that on the other way on the other side father your children are climbing higher to their position father may you remove every spirit of fear every doubt that the devil is trying to bring to the mind of your children to know who they are to accept who they are regardless of the situation just like gideon may they don't look at her complex at their height at their size because it's not really the size of the dog in the fight but it's the size of the fight in the dog and father you told us in your word that greater is it is he that is in you father and you are the one in us lord may we release that faith and let it operate the way it's supposed to be and may you protect and touch your children father i pray for the hamilton family lord i know they have been placed in quarantine but lord i pray that that demon called kovid leave their home completely and make that demon go back to hell in the name of jesus christ and may no one experience any symptom but may they take the time for a consecration lord and a closer walk with you lord i commit this church unto the hand may you strengthen your manservant that you use brother solomon lord give him more strength lord and continue to use him in a powerful way and continue to bless this church lord and to free us completely so that in this church there won't be anybody where sin is having dominion upon him father we commit everything and tonight unto the hand in the name of jesus christ hallelujah [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are here working in this [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are [Music] that is [Music]
