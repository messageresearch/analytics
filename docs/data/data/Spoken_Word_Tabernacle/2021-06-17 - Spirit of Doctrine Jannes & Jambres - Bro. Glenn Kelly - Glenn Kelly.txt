ready for the word amen i believe now we have a different perspective on our sisters right amen now we look at them like treasures of god amen because redemption was explained there the devil used eve to introduce and god use mary to counteract amen both of them are struggling but he didn't know he beat the wrong place amen he thought he got us in trouble and it's just a way for christ to express his attribute amen that's why we are even born in sin shaping and iniquity coming into the world speaking lies so now calvary can have a reason to be there amen now when you come to him he say i already knew that's why i slew that land before the foundation of the world amen how can i be a redeemer if you're not lost amen you must be lost first then he can come and rescue you amen and not

you in have your way lord god lord god take control of my mouth lord god speak what you want to be spoken because only you know what needs to be spoken to your precious children so father bless those that had a desire to be here and those that are on live stream and lord god we ask you to continue to bless each and every soul lord god that's fighting the good fight of faith for the work over there lord god for your building because father in his hour here now we know is getting close to leave lord god but you also instructed us to live every day a good christian humble life so lord jesus we looking unto you and father we bring every spirit under subjection on tonight every witchcraft demon every sorcery demon lord god that's trying to trouble the hearts and the minds of your people lord jesus you've given us that authority lord god and we know father all things are possible to them that believe whatever we ask we can receive if you're worried about in us and we abide in you so we thank you lord god in jesus name we pray amen and amen hallelujah you know i tell you it was just uh thinking about what the lord brought forth uh sunday you know i tell you just rich really rich you know and with the polycarp and coming behind brother steve i said hello i'm just a spare tire amen some of these young ones gonna have to rise up huh hallelujah all this word being being preached around here okay i won't prolong the time matthew 24 and 24. [Music] you know the last time we were here we're just gonna continue on in that way and still in the same area but we'll go kind of on another angle by the grace of god if that's the way he have us to go if he wants to change it let him change it matthew 24 and 24 those that have it say amen for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and show great signs and oneness in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and let's go over to um ephesians chapter six and then you may be seated hallelujah and we'll just read here at the verse 10 ephesians 6 and 10. so you have to say amen okay it says finally my brother be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that she may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated now we're looking here tonight a little thought is going to continue you know spirits of doctrine of religion the spirit of doctrines of religion you know you pray for me i never went into this area here by the grace of god i surely don't consider myself a teacher but we want to take our time and go through a lot of scriptures because uh the devil's in trouble huh kick the devil out hum brother robert i love that song kick the devil out you know we got him on the run you know saints you know we're not trying to keep up with the devil he's trying to keep up with us and you'll see what when brother branham start talking about what we're going to look at tonight uh you know we're going to look at one little point here it's going we want to look at james and james marines that's what we're going to look at tonight because brother branham talked about that in the end time and jesus christ talked about that in the end time so it's a spirit that is a religious demon we started out the last time we were here and let us get caught up i'm going to um read some things and then um we'll we'll get to our message spirits of doctrine you know the last time we were here we were showing you is by god's grace as no coincidence that god have us here and we read this out of the church age page 377 under the resume of the seven church ages and it says and we're reading this age started as after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to bring the bride where she was at pentecost we know that there must be a necessity be a return of the dynamic power see we're going to have the mechanics and the dynamics we're going to show you where it's going to be so close is going to deceive the very elect but it won't deceive us is that right huh because i like what the holy spirit said sunday because we were in the back of god's mind we're in the back of his mind is that right he knew and we are but we are following his thought we were his attributes we are for performing his word that god saw before the foundation of the world is that right so we're moving into something in this atria saturn but we're going to show you by the grace of god we are living a victorious life we should be living a victorious a joyous life that's why the lord told us even in my re-infirmities when the revelation came unto paul i said what i shall rejoice even in my infirmities is that right because he caught a revelation of why god want us to respond to those things is that right i don't want to get ahead of myself let me finish reading he said now he says he said the believers since in their spirits and began crying to god for a new outpouring such as it was in the first century he says what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues manifesting the gifts it was believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it says see this is what they thought this is what these religious demons is right they was hiding behind this they was hiding in that apes okay so we got over this it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or the teaching rain the latter rain then is the harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching reign had not come see so the last time we were here god is showing us that now we're here we're in the right place and the only way you could be in the right place it got to be by predestination is that right god already foreign hallelujah so he says now he says so the latter rain then is the harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching reign had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostals father had not yet come let me drop down a little bit he says in he said in it was a mixture of unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting the holy ghost you see what we were saying so he was saying even there at pentecost they was dancing they were shouting they were speaking in tongues manifesting the gifts but they still had a devil hiding with inside of them is that right there was some genuinely had the holy ghost but you still had a mixed multitude you had the devil there in the midst of it is that right so that's why the ones that's here is grace is always warning before judgment god is now warning the ones that came out is that right from where they came out at and thought they was going to hide but you got to understand the word is able to discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart what you hear in pentecost is no hiding now because the word is coming to unfold everything in this hour is that right we're going to what drug we're going to speak the word is that right look what he says he said under the he says spiritual blessings and manifestation in the holy ghost has had kept pointing out to you and it was it was the devil power as men were under the control of devils he said yet no one seemed to realize it to prove that it was not real these people even before the second generation these people organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines that's why we say our topic is spirits of doctrine of religion okay you know y'all put on your spiritual caps tonight because you gotta the holy spirit not only told us that we have to have what discernment is that right each and we know what's right and wrong but you now god has put in you spiritual discernment you should live to recognize the tricks of the devil okay that's why we said put on the whole armor of god so you may be able to withstand the wilds the trickery of the devil in these last days is that right because the devil we come with all kinds of tricks we're going to show you this is the fullness of it the fullness of it is because you have to know what the lord is ministering giving the pastor what he's given the pastor you got to understand after this is the rapture you hear what we're saying we're getting out of here saints let's bear with us on tonight hallelujah he said now look he says lordy i feel good he says organizer wrote their unscripted doctrine and built and built their their own fences and group ahead he says remember while jesus was upon the earth so was judas each came from a different spirit and upon death each to to their own place the spirit of christ now we want to go to um second thessalon i mean ii timothy let's go to second timothy three and what we're working with god give us grace i got this little ipad up here trying to get like your young fellas holly for polycarp maybe i could learn to use these ipads or something huh hallelujah i told her hey look where we got he says now look second thirst that's second timothy three you have it say amen he said this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come see the times now the only way you're going to be able to tolerate this you're going to have to realize you're going to have to have the baptism of the holy ghost is that right now when god came in there he's moving us into now into a position to where that individual bride last time we was here she knows she's having a revival with inside is that right she knows that the lord is moving is that right so we have to understand in this hour here now what god has called us to do no one can perform what god has you to do in the back of his mind is that right so in the lord i tell you that's what he was trying to show us their sunday morning right he said it was what what is that bro rabbit north huh he told us west he tore his south and he said what east is that right isn't that right see the whole time that's where god wanted to play the whole time god never wanted to deal with the outer part the body of the spirit he wanted to deal with the heart he always wanted to deal with your heart that's why he says when malloy cloud four come when malachi 4 came this was this he said he said turn to what the hearts of the fathers of the children back to malachi 4 and 5 okay hallelujah thank you jesus he said now look for for men shall be lovers of their own what self you're talking about men we're talking put on your spiritual caps we're talking about demon forces here tonight he says now he says belovers of their own self covenant boasters proud blasphemous disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without what natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent despises of those that are good now remember these are demon forces that are hiding in people's lives that are claiming to be christians huh they are claiming to be christians so we are not to come in with a critical spirit we are coming here you'll see it's things that god is allowing to do what to build the character of christ in our lives is that right so that's why tribulation work and patience taking work experience experiences work with hope the hope that we shall not be ashamed of is that right hallelujah thank you lord he says traitors heavy high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god see these demon forces you're going to recognize them in people's lives we're just hitting the surface we don't have time to go in all these things you got to go home and dig into them these are demon forces that are in people's lives and we know we want we come to set free because we know that god actually created man in his image in his likeness is that right so we know that these people are really thirsting for god is there we know that they're thirsting for god we are not trying to get him to a church and we are not trying to get him to a catholic a baptist a methodist a lutheran a presbyterian is that right you have to catch the revelation you study with a baptist you become a baptist you study with a catholic you become a catholic you study with a lutheran you become a lutheran but oh god if someone studied with you study with the word study with a christian they become just like christ is that right hallelujah [Applause] this is real saints that's why we're playing churches over it's over we're in the war you're in a real war and you're going to see these demons is targeted at us these demons come to take us out is that right that's why brother polycarp what did he say he said thanking god for what he did looking for the things to come but they're always missing what god is doing right there and in the midst of them is that right only way you're going to know the word that you receive you have to apply it to your life you have to apply it you have to believe it and that's the only way it's going to come to life is that right hallelujah look what he says he says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from which they turn away see denying the holy ghost denying that baptism of the holy ghost the only thing that's going to save them the only thing that's going to keep them and deep down inside that's why brother branham said when he ran that baptism of the holy ghost series when he ran that series he said this is a soul meeting this is something to clean your soul something to get down in there so you'll be able to walk right ready to talk right able to love right you're able to pray right maybe to sing right everybody rejoice right is that right you're recognizing then there's something else that happened in that garden is that right you got to go dig when he's in that garden where there was adam was never supposed to be on the outside of the garden anyway he was supposed to be in the east side is that right the holy ghost brought that thing up beautiful son is that right so what he was there for why did he bring him out of egypt hallelujah i want to get ahead of myself thank you lord he said his word sometimes have a what a compound meaning huh he goes look what he says verse 6 he says for of this sort are they which creep in their houses and lay captive silly silly women excuse me silly women laden with sins led away with what divers what lust come in there you talking about supposed to be so-called christians huh supposed to be saying that they're born again saying that they got the holy ghost son you got people up in the pool pit not even living clean lives is that right and they're saying they speaking and seeking and people have with silly women is that right but god said their father shall be made known is that right he's unfolding it hallelujah look what we're talking about hillary women he says ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the what the truth unbelief to see that unbelief is in their souls there we're going to look at it he says now here's what we're looking at tonight james and jamboree james and jamboree i wrote the thing down there they this is two spirits brother branham talked about these two and when he talked about him what he was he was trying to show him it was going to be there in the end time in any time that this spirit was going to be jamborees mean opposing and rebellious that's the spirit that's on the jamborees and jainans mean vexed and disputed okay so you watch these spirits we're going to go through some scriptures and you can recognize him so what we do is that's why he says you got the son of god in this message and you've got the sons of the prophets in this message the sons of gods discern things spiritually is that right they let the holy ghost they could discern these things and when they discern these things and things that god show them is because their hearts and their minds are right and god know they would take it to them in prayer they would not be critical they would not kill nobody down they would try to set that person free so that's why god would share those things with them that's what we're talking about because if my brother is bond was foreign and fornication you going to let my brother go if god bring my name his name to me in prayer i'm going to shout that name there in prayer you're going to let them go if they're struggling with pornography you're going gonna let them go if they struggling with lust you gonna let them go that's what we're gonna do we're gonna go on war we're gonna go our offensive prayer if you want to see a successful christian in anything that he do he will go to the lord in prayer first [Music] ain't that what the holy spirit had that was beautiful what the holy spirit had brother steve say sunday morning if you can a job or you're a proprietor or you have a business or you got a vehicle or something and you know you sought god and god told you it's all right for you to get it then you go right back to god huh he has the answer for it okay when joshua had seen the works of god when god told them that they was going to go out to battle and was not going to lose not a one is that right he immediately did what when they lost i think it was 26 souls joshua immediately did what fell went into prayer crying out to god because he knew if i can't depend on god's word then who can i depend on huh look what he says help us lord he says now look james and jim marine he says now every learning is never coming to the knowledge of the truth he said now as james and jamarine which stood moses as so do these also resist the what the truth he says what now even brother branham said look at this he said men he said men of corrupt minds reprobate see they just rock low down fear god fear nobody down in their soul they head into the pits of hell that's why jesus said you vipers you snake in the grass you always resist the holy ghost just like your fathers is that right he knew jesus could discern his only one knew that they was of the devil is that right because he recognized that religious demon what the holy ghost said the first thing they're going to attack they always come in in the message of the hour is that right they always attacking the message of the hour but we have to understand now what god has given us now and i'm going to get to and read it but what he's given us now is that the devil the religious demons know that they're in trouble hear what he said they know it huh that's right brother robert they know they in trouble but what we have to do is we got to know that we got him on the run is that right you got the right to bind you got the right to loose side you got the right to grant somebody eternal life you speaking by faith you will because god's going to do it in his time but he'll do it how much more shall he avenge what his elect if i sigh and cry and pray day and night is that right god will do it for his elect oh faith when i return to the earth shall i find what faith this is a faith this is a faith that's working by love [Music] what's driving him is love was he a real revelation of my wife and i was going through virginia one time and we were driving through virginia and we got and we was going into a a walmart was out there and there was some mother cat and her kitties was running across the um i was running across walking across the street and i tell you that's when i got the revelation of love god comes in simplicity i mean the true revelation and cars was out there and one of the kittens went back that mama kitten ran out in that street dropped that traffic to get her baby and grabbed that kitten and went on back over there that's a that's a faith that's working by love he said look what he says he says he says the men of corrupt mind let's go over to exodus 7. when we look at 7 yeah exodus 7 you'll see when god was dealing with moses and he didn't and and he didn't pacify moses he didn't enjoy moses telling them that he was incompetent god said well who made the mouth that is god was rebuking him but he extended that hand of grace to him and did what and allow aaron to be his prophet and moses was a god to the people he said now look at here we're talking about james and jamarine let's start at verse 8 for the sake of time he says and the lord spake unto moses and aaron sing when pharaoh shall shall speak unto you saying show a miracle for you he said then thou shall say unto aaron take thyroid and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a what a serpent he said and moses and aaron went and went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his right before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent it says then pharaoh also called the who now look at the wise men brother brandon talked about this jesus talked about them in the end time so here i went and just pulled up the hebrew of it look what the wise men are you know god got his wise men satan got his wise man is that right so we have to understand that these wise men here they were talking about these sorcery workers he said they were intelligent they're skillful they're artful they're cunning they're subtle and they're wise-hearted so these are those characteristics we know how the devil is and then also the skillful is the good technical workers if you're writing the scriptures down you can go to isaiah 40s they're they were very they they just didn't get anyone to build these idols they got skillful men that was working there under idolatry on the sorcery they know exactly what they're doing they know exactly what they're looking at that's why we say obedience is better than a sacrifice when the holy spirit was ministering towards um proverbs 7 he says she looked at through the castments of her window and she noticed that some there was void of understanding wherever you're void of understanding act that's where the devil is going to come and try to plug at you out now you have to you know you god says everyone know the wickedness and the bitterness of their own heart you know where you struggle at you got to pray and buying that area up every day until god come and deliver you out of that area as you think it we're talking about fighting we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers of high places is that right but we got our armor is that right which is the word of god which is anointed by god by the spirit of god we have the what the helmet of salvation so you have to understand i don't want to get ahead of myself we're going to go over the second we're going to go over to second corinthians after we read this i finish reading this about these men why jesus talked about these men why brother branham talked about these men in the end time because he said it's going to be so close it will deceive the very elect if it was possible that's why you got the son of gods and the sons of the prophets and we're dealing with this in this end time now they got the same weapons we got and the ones that was in this message they come and they're trying to twist the minds of the people that's why we say the spirit of doctrine the teachings and the teachings they never i saw a man one time and if i didn't know the truth by god's grace and god's mercy i said you know i saw a pastor one time take that trinity and make you think it was right that's right brother robert the theologians i'm telling you this is just not a letter here that's why they emphasized james and jamarine in the end time he said why they're wise and administrative they're very very wise in the administration you tell i i'm something the one who came to me delilah delilah was very sharp in the administration of working on samsung once samson got himself out of the will of god you're playing on the devil's ground now so we have to realize now when he got around it she played him all the way to the end and then what and got his eyes plucked out is that right but oh god the devil tried to pull us too brother robert tried to tell us tell us that clown wasn't right didn't he ah but god hid that for us sir until the end time and showed us that samson meant what he meant son is that right and he also wasn't what the judge is that right and he was the judge in the book of judges and he brought that cloud down there is that right and when the sun the mighty cloud came it came to bring judgment on the land for laodiceas he couldn't the very elect will not be deceived [Applause] who know the mind of god who can counsel god no one witchcraft demons witchcraft demons didn't know that we had a god of done given us a word ah he's throwing them shots see when you come and you come in and attack god's sheep you're like david when you're coming you come to mess with one of god's sheep you know what you're gonna do he said you uncircumcised philistine i remember when my god took care of that lion took care of that bear when they come out there in the wilderness and try to mess with one of my shepherd so all you got to do if your father is struggling if your mother is struggling if your husband is struggling if your son is struggling if your daughter is struggling just call their name out in prayer and keep on calling it out is that right ain't that worth it you got a right to call it out remember that woman with her her son got caught up with that social disease huh she must have read about them over there and with that unjust judge she must have read about that unjust judge because she kept coming and she kept coming praying day and night is that right she knew she had a right she knew that what christ had done we know in his hour here now saints he went to the cross living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising away you got to cast that word cast that word out there cast that word out there is that right he knew you got to bring him down is that right that's why i don't want they had to get that body off of the cross didn't they it was not fulfilled yet they had to get the body off of the cross didn't they they had to go get it they had to beg them for that body because it had to be fulfilled he died to do what he was buried and carried my sins far away i better not get on that that's another message help me lord james and jeremy the spirit of doctrine look what they said he says now he says in verse 11. then pharaoh also called the wise men another thing about the wise men the shrewd the crafty the cunning and the subtle you see remember the woman and the youth women use those women just like you use delilah remember the woman when solomon i mean not solomon uh absalon he wanted to get him back in jerusalem and that woman and that woman you see how she went to that king she knew how to go to that king she knew how to get what they needed at that time so you had the same way you takes the spirit that was on paul paul knew how to dress king agrippa is that right he didn't come to him now now paul's spirit was changed when he was saw he was he was rough he was persecuting christians but when you meet jesus your life's changing the character changes your walk changer your talk changer your speech changer his singing saying god you're no longer real you're no longer doing the things the way that you used to do is that right so when he came in there brother greg when he came to king agrippa he said king of grip herself if you permit me to speak sir and when paul knew how to agree them he knew the order of the pharisees and the pharisees he was the sadducees he recognized his position they that the way that woman went to the king over over there i think from tikka over there when she wanted to get absalom back into jerusalem i think with joab he wanted to get absalom back into jerusalem she always addressed the king by his authority didn't the lord tell us respect the position you don't have to agree with the unrighteousness but you respect the position because in them because that position still can get you grace god can use them to get you grace look what he says he says and also they learn shrew these are wise men they learn they shrewd they're astrologers magicians they're wise ethically and religiously see they're very they're very spoken they speak with wisdom and they know how to approach they will study your culture no i used to get over there i should learn people learn around there now's the word on the workforce supervise people fellowship with them find out whether that i go home and google it i don't care if they're from africa i don't care they're from jamaica i don't care if they're from there i took interest i took interest in them and when you take interest in them it's an open door when i was in the prisons new system going in there young men that were locked up some most of them belong there but some are innocent they belong in there they couldn't understand why some of the roughest ones they would come to the bible studies wisdom comes from god not man most of them in there was in love with their grandmother or their mother i don't care if it was two or three hours away i would go visit their grandmother mother and their grandmother would tell them that i came to visit them all i was after trying to get them to christ i wasn't looking for no glory i was getting the wisdom from god and when you see someone and you recognize because each that's our whole mission we're going to show you why paul went to prison the automotive when your motive interjected when brother sam was here his motive and objective i know brother sam for a year is always looking for lost souls always looking for lost souls you're looking for an opportunity let us keep going he said it was wise and religiously but now let's look down here verse 11. he says the pharaoh also called wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of the of egypt they also did like manner with their enchantments for they cast down every man who was they cast down every man now look at this here and they became serpents but aaron's rod aaron only had the one rod but look around in there in this end time you're going to find out that we sorceries all kinds of witchcraft there's all kinds of demons there's all kinds of devils that we're fighting against moses has announced god put sent moses on a mission not to back up but to move forward cast down your rod cast your word out get on offense of prayer you don't have to inhale anything get on offense of prayer are you driving those demon forces away the devil going to make you think is not being effective but a fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much hallelujah he says now look and it did what and it hardened pharaoh's heart that he hearken not unto them let me read something here for you god give me grace i won't he says look here still working with the spirit of the the spirit of doctrine this quote here come out of uh faith works works his faith expressed 11 26 65 he says why moses went down to perform the works of god before the people and there was james and jamirine standing there he said but who was first to do it these others see were impersonators because there had to be an original first for them to impersonate if they begin to the original he says we're not lost we know where where we're at see by the scripture and by the revelation of god that's why you still stand [Music] god we're going to we're going to get there we're going to show you why god do it why did god allow why did he allow that same anointing to come on someone to come against his servant when he sent his servant down there on a mission he said now he says why this man he seems visions and so forth he does this he run around who he's talking about these two that had gifts he says in three gods i'ma drop down for the sake of time he said but this word measures them up see this word for this day we got the measuring stick is that right you don't have to back down off of no demons no sorcery no witchcraft demons you got to understand maybe perhaps uh there's something in the world that you're struggling with you have to understand everything some has things in their souls they have to get out maybe they inherited from granddaddy grandmama from daddy from mama from somewhere along the line maybe they inherit this thing and they struggle in it but you have to understand if you got a fake seed that god put there before the foundation of the world is that right you have a seed down in there that faith that's working by love you don't have to be concerned about what the devil is trying to resurrect in your own life because jesus when he died and took our sins is that right and buried them living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising we now are in the midst of the resurrected christ the resurrected christ is now here back on the scene some got it all mixed up we're going to read the quote i want to get don't want to get ahead of myself but you got to understand how to fight this devil is that right he said because the imagination of the heart and the mind and the spirit of this age is kind evil continuously is that right that is not us is that right don't let the devil keep telling you that you were the children of disobedience he can't tell me i was a child of disobedience i was among the i was among the children out there in the world of disobedience but i was not a child of disobedience i was a child of god is that right he brought us he told me from the beginning of the world that i was an attribute i was in his mind is that right so you have to understand now all these things is not in you sometimes you're just picking up thoughts you got to cast down every imagination that try to exalt itself against the word of god so when the word is coming in his hour here now and is that right was peter see yes peter with seed is that right but jesus did not deal with peter i'm just catching the mind of god now peter did not kiss but peter was seated is that right but peter did not done right did not speak to jesus and tell jesus that he wasn't going to go to golgotha and died up on that cross is that right immediately jesus turned around and said what hush your mouth satan is that right he never rebuked peter those thoughts that you're picking up that's satan that's taking it bringing it through your mind that's satan trying to make you think you're that person but you cast down is that right you've been born again is that right by the water in other spirits you are a child of god you have coming to your senses now you recognize who you are don't stop listening to the devil there's no good man that's why i said there's truth he shrews me that's why the holy ghost came and ambushed them when the pastor was working at that you know what subtle me sort of subtle satan knows when he said he's professional he's the biologist knows every part of that body he knows every part of that body he knows how to touch that body he knows how to touch it to bring a feeling to you hear what i'm saying so you have to understand that's why the holy ghost teaches us first it has to be agape love god is that right the agape love anything at the agape lover is what the affiliated lover and then after that is what love stuff and then after that is filthy is that right he's that's why he says they come seeking their lust that lust is wrongful thoughts is that right the wrongful thoughts that's why the last time i was here his one of his tactics is obsession obsession is received the wrong thoughts is that right he's trying to get you to receive the wrong thoughts so he'll shoot those thoughts at your mind is that right i'ma tell you something i've sat up in places where you get ready you get ministers they got spirits on them i'm telling you how to fight this devil tonight brother branham said they got to be taught how to fight this devil i'll tell you i see them sitting up in there a pastor sitting up there that had a spirit on him and when he had that spirit on him he was shooting that spirit at me and i was shooting him back at him he was shooting it at me i was shooting him back at him and all of a sudden that spirit left and he did it and he regrouped himself and got right i'm trying to tell you james and jamarine in the end time you don't have to accept nothing but the promises of god you had to go with no goodness to go in there in those institutions all he said many come in my name when you go into this institution every religion it's not uh we wasn't it wasn't the murderer was afraid of the drug addict prostitute child molester it wasn't them the one you got most of your trouble at was those religious demons after you left when you telling them trinity is no such thing as trinity in the scriptures and you're telling them there's only one matthew 28 18 baptized in the name of the father in the name of the son in the name of the holy ghost the father we know is not a name son is not a name holy ghost is the pronoun so tell me now brother let me give you the what the revelation of matthew 28 19. now let's go over to action you can't get to the book of acts until you go to the gospels is that right you got to come through the gospel you got to get it burned out that's why it says the doctrines of devils when jesus first got his disciples he went and took them up on the mountain and the bible said he did what he taught them is that right now you got to get you ready remember when we went in school and we had science and we had to dissect that frog when you were in there to dissect that frog first you went there you had to be taught is that right after they told you about it then you went to the lab for about an hour and everybody had to dissect that frog is that right so that's the same thing in them you got to be born again by the water and of the spirit is that right you got to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost there's a promise under you and your children and those that are called to far off we're going to get to the scriptures and act and show you what happened when they got into the acts is that right we're in a war saints you're in a real spiritual war is that right but we have the victorious when the enemy come in like a flood god promised to lift up a mighty standing against it is that right greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world you have what god is dealing you with you let god perfect you with it is that right i know i know a person in there i'll tell you he was so concerned about others he had a love for others he had a love for others father something brother the revival is going on it's already going on and when he moved into his position when he moved in his position god even manifested more what did he wanted to do through him is that right once you find your position that's why i said you may not you may be out of place but you'll never lose your position before the what before the foundation of the world god granted you that position is that right lift them up on high if you wanna miraculously work you want the miraculous work to happen just go to god and ask god and make sure your motive and objective is right is that right you make sure you got the love of god's phone what happened you got a child that's struggling with a demon a strong angry mean demon and trying to kill him or a lunatic demon you want to get that demon out of there just love them brother brown said that man came on in got around there just killed the old preacher down the street broke his jaw broke his collarbone he said he'd come around in there and they got over there no preacher coming in and come up to the pool pitch he said bobby could have tore him off brother branham told him brother robert i know what he said he said this night you're going to fall across my legs and they visit boom already across this legend is that right speak the word saints speak the word now this is the hour to speak the word what are we waiting for we got the mechanics and the dynamics we got the former rain and the latter rain you're right man hey you want you a good you want you a christian husband good morning colorado when i met my wife it was supernatural i said i was going to get it officer that i was going to get married at a certain time i told my buddies i was going to get married at a certain time you know what she must have wanted to get married or something because i wasn't ready to get married we were sitting in school in the campus and we were sitting there on the campus and we were sitting there brother greg i've never seen it before and he was sitting there my buddy we was eating and when i looked up and she was walking in the cafeteria i told my buddy i said i'm gonna marry her he looked at me and said you know what he said you're out around my brother able to know what he told me he said you out of your mind you don't even know her you ever met her no man i never met her i don't know her but i'ma marry her and we got around is that right it was what you say brother steve brother steve it was never lost it was never lost it was never lost [Applause] it was the character it was the character she walked in there like a lady then i saw that character and it picked my heart they said what god put together let no man take us under in this year be what tell me god didn't put it together 46 years [Applause] tell me this word ain't true god even protected us that we was yet in our sins hallelujah said lord if he promised you wouldn't be embarrassed or unfruitful is that right you think god's got a husband out there for you hallelujah that's what he said help me lord he says now look he said look what he says he says in the james and jim marine he says now but this word measures them up that's exactly right this is where it comes to as moses and jamarine and remember he said james and jamareen withstood moses in the last days these impersonators will rise on the earth again did he say it well we got them but that didn't stagger moses see we said when moses turned around and done a miracle in the name of the lord he stood there's these impersonators done the same thing that didn't stop him well i guess i'd better quit no it didn't he stayed right there for what it was revealed to him hallelujah he says knowing look what he says he says knowing knowing that the word would finally catch up with them don't fuss with them when they say very robbery don't fuss with them don't argue with him don't do nothing you gotta love him because he says what he knew that the word is gonna catch up with them he knows there's gonna come a time when the word would manifest itself and they couldn't go no further so have i known to see we know that it's coming to the point the revelation that god is unfolding you go into the hidden light the message of hidden life the prophet of god kept telling us in this message here he said see some that came here they thought it was going to stop they thought they were going to be able to hide they thought they was going to be able to bring them devils up in here but they didn't check the word brother robert they didn't look in it in his life brother branham said it's going to keep unfolding it's going to keep unfolding it's going to keep unfolding it's going to keep unfolding it's going to get sweeter and sweeter in sweden until we wrap john out of here look what he says help me lord he says now look at his old rotten tactic satan packed it he said the devil came right up into a person they write to the very thing till it comes to the word see now see brother gray he's in trouble now we have the backup of no devil we know what we got we know what god promised for this time okay he said now look he said but he he can't he can't satan can't take the word he can't take all the word he can bring it up maybe to one little like he did eve the devil did eat but he can't cross it all see the whole thing is the body of christ we got the whole body young man i'm telling you if you go over there god y'all gonna have something that the devil knows he's gonna be in trouble when they come up against you is that right because you don't have to fight through all that the denominational teachings you don't have to fight for that foolishness is that right you don't have to fight those demons of doctrine all you got to do is humble yourself consecrate yourself and let god use you surrender yourself to the will of god and as jesus said if i if i be lifted up from the earth i'll do what i'll draw all men unto you is that right the preaching of the cross was foolishness to them but it was power to the man that is saved he said look what he says he said their works impersonated was made known he said now he said they they could not cannot take the message now neither could james or jamarine in one of the quotes brother branham said he said you know why some of them are leaving and they run because they said it's too strict he said it's too strict he already prophesied and said these things it's not that what he's doing is making a lady out of you if you're struggling what he's doing is making a man out of you if you're struggling that's what he's doing he's bringing you into the image of christ again is that right hallelujah he says the works of of imitation uh impersonation was made known because they could not be able to follow god's word vindicated by his anointed prophet they cannot follow israel why why couldn't they follow you why sister you're here because god brought you here you thank god you're in the right place you understand what we're saying is that right even though those cervices look at that woman she brought them to jesus is that right that ill-famed woman is that right they wanted to stone her the baptist that right because they said she committed adultery or committed a crime whatever it was but they brought them to jesus and jesus didn't know by the law they didn't even have the witness is that right where's the witness is that right but they were so carnal minded they were so devilish minded they was she was bringing them to salvation she was bringing them to salvation and they missed it but she got her deliverance she got hurt they brought her hair there but through her life she was bringing them there she caught it and they missed it and they were supposed to be the religious one is that right hallelujah help me lord he said now look they might do all kinds of false impersonations things that don't do it to do nothing but magnify the right he says anything any believing child knows that the truth he says in plain view the works of their folly is going to be made known if your works is the true word and vindicated it says by it by your faith it will manifest and the promise of god in the original written word says it if i if i do it not jesus said if i do or not then believe me not that's john 10 37. he said that now look at this here he says if i don't do the works he said that's it if i don't do the works the scriptures tell you i will do them do in my age see we're getting the message for this age it's not the pentecostal denomination it's the pentecostal experience that god we're now performing in there now we're going to show you so when he first came he got the healing is that right he had the prophecies is that right and now that was the what is the opening of the word of the third paul is that right but if we move beyond that it's now the opening of the mysteries it have nothing just brother steve it can't be brother steve opening that it had to be another move the next move had to be the opening of the mysteries i'ma read it to you in a minute he said look hallelujah help me lord finish with that one look what paul had to fight the religious devils let's turn to acts uh 29 i mean i'm sorry you know that's romans 2. romans chapter 2. and we'll look in there we'll show you these demon forces that paul even in his time he he had to fight this the romans let me see for the sake of time um look at verse 28 and 29 romans 2 28 and 29 it says for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcised which is outwardly in the flesh now paul now had to come up against this religious doctrine this religious teachings paul had to come up and get it you see so you have to realize what people will do they'll come and they'll try to get you to bite on the word hear what i'm saying they're trying to get you to fight over and then if you do see now is an open door but immediately you got you got a discernment that's in there that's why when he say they take up us the council jesus said what take no thought for what you say i will put the words in your mouth our heart our mind is to steadfast on christ on the word of god of all time we're pure clinking he's thinking he said if there's any virtue in this think on what what's holy what's pure what's honest what's just what's righteous think on these things is that right he's trying to keep your heart in your mind clear he said take no thought is that right for tomorrow he was telling the first thing the devil's going to do what obsession he tries to come to your mind obsession with the wrong thought and then if you bite on it it's oppression then he'll oppress you with that thought is that right and when he oppresses you with that thought and then after he oppresses you with it he'll get you to possess it is that right eventually that you do that's what eve i mean that's what um the serpent did with eve is that right she had no business even listening to god already gave her the word is that right so we have to understand god started from the beginning it was from the beginning it was never supposed to be a group it was never supposed to be a group when they took the word and say the same thing you can only say the same thing by revelation if brother steve got situations here in this group if we have a situation he can't handle the way maybe brother josh handle his situation well maybe another brother had his situation you see we under the same word situation but you got to sit down and you got to talk to someone that's why in the world even the police will say what's the motive let's find out the motive first you got some people can be wrong in that doctrine and write in their spirit and you could be right writing your doctrine but wrong in your spirit i'd rather be right in my spirit at all times you see because your spirit is right you can work with it is that right so we have to understand you are not under the leviticus law and that's the teachings that was hiding in this message you got the leviticus law of the sons of the prophets and of the sons of god of the message of malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 these are the sons of god they know as the holy spirit said sunday they know they're on the way a melchizedek is that right the veil has been ripped off he's now did what in this message now they didn't know it the holy ghost came and told them you got a pastor we already have all of all christ and god is what one is that right you got christ and god is one at the christ in god and then you got the message of the age william marion branham is that right you gotta talk to a brother from iran the other day brother how you doing fine brothers you're fine i said oh where's your country what country are you from he said iran i said oh oh what are you muslim he said oh yeah muslim i said good i said i'm christian i'm a christian i said mohammed your prophet he said yeah he said he said you know my prophet prophetess he said yes jesus i said no we are marrying bran and he said i said william marian branham malachi 4 luke 17 30. revelation 10 1-7 now know he going i know it's shaking him up because they think jesus is the prophet i said no no no no jesus was the son of god and he was god he was son of god and he was god my brother he was god manifested in the flesh so you like to get out of there this is what i'm telling you doctrines doctrines got people bind up but god has brought us into a liberty is that right where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty so that's why now he's coming he's bringing us this word bring william branham is the what the pastor to the age is that right he has the what brother steve he has the bullet he had the bullet to grant somebody grace is that right when he got around in there when he knew that somebody was in a tough situation is that right and the developer kept pushing him and kept pushing him and kept pushing him and he didn't want to give him the letter he didn't brother brandon didn't want to give him the letter because he know the letter of the word would have killed him the letter of the word would have tore him up the letter of the word would have destroyed him the letter of the word would have messed his household up the letter of the word he says but no let me come back let me go and find out on this matter first is that right he went to the mountain is that right he went and met god is that right he had a witness at the bottom of the mountain is that right then the fight that was going up and down and up and down and the angel of the lord was coming from the top and was bringing him the answer down there is that right he came back down with the answer and he told him is that right he said well man god had given me grace son brother stevie pulled a bullet out he said what be on your way and do what sin no more is that right teach your children's children the right way now look at grace is that right oh god the will of god will never lead you where the grace of god can't get you out of it hallelujah we're talking about it now you understand what god is doing for us in his hour here now we with months we claim we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity coming the world speaking not nobody can condemn no one no one can tell no one now is we're only saved by the grace of god and we only hear because of his predestination is that right so we have to realize then what the pastor of the local assembly is that right he can get grace for you is that right so that's why you have situations call the pastor let him talk to you he's the one that can get you grace in certain situations that not a deacon can or other minister can but him if you're in that local assembly he can go to god and in your household fathers get straight and if you're struggling straighten up huh you got to get straight in your household you realize that i should tell my wife that i said oh no no no i said something right in my house i'm the blame i'm the blame i tell my family members don't mean my wife you know your family like blame your wife sometimes and stuff because things are no no no no no no no me i say no no okay that's why god put it in a vocabulary that's why you put it in a dictionary sometimes it has to be used no okay so you have to realize that i don't have to explain it to you he's giving me that authority i don't have to explain it to you is that right so you have to understand you see so my god my god so we have to understand and it's that we're here now that what you've called to is that right so we have to realize that you're there men rise up come at me if you've got to lay in the guard all night i wasn't going to say no but i'll tell you after now i didn't know what god had and i've been up for two days i and i am not tired i know he was giving me the strength and y'all prayers and my wife to tell you as a witness i didn't know what was going on sometimes you just got to wait you got to wait you got the weight you have to pray you got to wait you have to pray you have to wait because these religious demons i'm telling you they're no good they got people bound up got people locked down with these religious demons that's why brother branham even jesus says he said to be so close and deceive the very elect if it was possible i seen then locked down locked down i know a man wouldn't even go and get a job for his family he needed a job he said it was the center day of venice and he couldn't work from friday midnight i think up until sunday or something like that it wouldn't take a job for his feed his family religion we don't have religion we got salvation it's the difference let me keep going i want to read this my time done went off let me read this and let me read this here i want to i want to read this here paul look what paul told him 28 29 i'ma speed it up now he says now look he says for he is not a jew within an outwardly neither is that a circumcision which is outwardly is the flesh but he is a jew which is one of what circumcision is that of of the what of the heart and in the what spirit and not in the what letter whose praises is not of what men but of who but of god that's why he said verse 3 he wanted them in eden he only put him outside of eating the labor because what he did when pharaoh told him when moses went to them he said pharaoh let my people go so that they can worship me he said i had no one to tilt the ground i had no he was what elohim he was not even god yet over in genesis 1 he didn't become god until genesis 2 then he had somebody to worship him go look at it go back and look in there oh brush these the lord don't open the can of worms there that tilt is too fold that tilt is to worship that's why he said he always wanted to deal with the heart that's why i was looking at you brother steve when you went there i said my god my god he always wanted to deal with the heart a true worship is from the heart you say you love me with your lips but your heart is far from me don't tell me this ministry this ministry ain't open some things up hallelujah let me look at let me read this one more god help me i want you to see this one here thank you jesus the spirit of doctrines of religion we didn't even touch the surface of it i tell you so much he said now look in here god help me here it is thank you jesus he said now brother brannon was working with anointed ones at the end time 7 25 65. he says in james and jamaris matthew 24 false crisis false anointed during the doing signs and wonders to deceive the elected remember god was letting them do that he was letting them do that in the ages because he wanted them to think they had just as much as we had [Music] he's blinding them let them be [Music] their fathers don't ran out it's not already run out let me finish reading i'll show you has nothing to ministry that we're sitting up under this folly their folly has already ran they're shaking now he said look he said now as james and jamery would stood moses reprobated mine concerning the faith he said not a faith the faith you can have one faith without believing in the lord you can't have two baptisms no one father or son and holy ghost there's one baptism jesus christ he says notice compare them together when you when you get home matthew 24 24 jesus speaking paul is speaking the same thing second timothy three and eight he said many many others he says now compare that and put put on another scripture he said look luke 17 30. malachi 4. he's moving into something brother brandon was moving into something he was showing him something he says that james and jameerine which stood moses and anointed the anointed word of the hour so will these men not man see men when moses threw his rod down the anointed vessel that day god was showing him showing pharaoh brother raleigh showing them sorcery showing them witchcraft workers you know ran up to run up against the wrong one now it's a power on the land now that's greater than what you got now you witchcraft demons you sorcery demons you lying demons we driving you away now you know the anointing is present now that's why your kingdom is being why do they heathen rage and amazing van things [Music] he's in trouble he said look he says he says now the hour so when these men men anointed once resists the truth and every day that the son of man is revealed revelations 10 1-7 he says now look god help me hallelujah he said now look james and jamie who are help me lord he said now and musicians you can come forth i know it's getting late i'm not going to keep you long we got a long week he said now look he said where's the life going now away from the organization no more shock grain a rebuke to the pentecost to full fulfill the scripture of this hour see notice very day this messenger when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message that's what they couldn't handle not the healing not just the prophecies but when the message started that's why they scattered if they didn't that's why they didn't leave egypt they couldn't leave it because they couldn't withstand what god has bringing now bringing us into he's bringing us into the character of christ he's bringing us to where you'll be able to handle the word with meekness with gladness with humility you can look at him and truly love him and pray for him that's what we're moving into he said look at this here he said now but when when it declares his message the first pull was healing the second pull was prophecy the third point of opening of the word the what the mysteries revealed is what we're getting now there's no more higher order to reveal than the word than the prophets he said but the only way the prophet can be a vindicated is by the words the third pull was the opening the third pull was the opening of them seven seals look what it was for brother steve and now i see why you think it became a new book to reveal the hidden truths that's been sealed in the word that's where we're at and everyone is not receiving it because it's not for everyone he says the first he said now i'm going to show you three things i had them fulfills three things that laid you right there he says first he's going to show the world is in a sodom condition jesus said it would happen look at the perversion he says our women trying to act like men are men trying to act like women cystified rotten filthy low down devil possessed and don't know it see blind miserable wretched naked and rich and saving good and don't even realize god have mercy lord lord have mercy on their souls he says in and he said the bible says that that would happen he said that's where it's at he said secondly it's that the hour according to the scripture here that james and jamarines appear see he's bringing to us signs letting us know where we're at he's not you remember this is 65 he says 30 is that the same hour that the son of man is to be revealed there is there is your believer you're me see he said there's your believer you're a make-believer and you're a non-believer he's right before you this was after the seals when he now knew the things was being made known in this hour oh and i hadn't even touched the surface i'm telling you spiritual doctrine wait until we get into ruling those scriptures and you'll see you'll see that james and jamarine knows that they're in trouble now but they're coming after us but
