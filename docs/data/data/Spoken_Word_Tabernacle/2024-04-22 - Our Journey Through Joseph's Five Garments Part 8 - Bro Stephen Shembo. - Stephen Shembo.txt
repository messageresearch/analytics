little bit let me just go over this April the 27 that will be our question and answer brother Enoch let me double check again with the Deacon to confirmed to you the youngst men meeting young sisters we had a wonderful meeting yesterday got into courtship and everything so by God's grace we try to take courtship one step of the time but at least you have a big bulk of it that happened yesterday and everybody should be squared away what to say what to do what not to do when you're in a courtship versus when you are engage all this thing was covered yesterday so they should be ready for the service today amen amen amen yes by God's grace we touch the finances again and we trust it's a blessing because I don't want to see any one of you suffering amen this series continue to unfold over and over so I thought I'm going to preach four sermon and be done and go back and continue but it seems like boss continue to unfold things one after the other so I might try to see if I would talk with Brother David if we can put some theme on the title because all he say is part one part two part three and you don't know what we spoke after a month you won't remember exactly which part did we talk about which one so I will try to see since we still at part eight today so if we can put some theme there so you know that in part one we talk about this part two this is what we touch and we move on just to give you a reference and make things easier for you is that okay praise be to the name of the Lord so let's go to our scripture then I believe I cover everything next Saturday April the 27th that will be question and answer and everything will be sent to you by the Deacon on the group uh Church chat I saw one more quote yesterday or before yesterday and I put it on the church group chat I gave you three probably before and I added so you have four these quotes are for you for your children and if you you are fellow sh shiing with somebody a friend or a message believer you can also share those quotes but I just want you to be gred in the word you have referenced that whatever you're doing you're doing that because you have a quot or you have a scripture where brother Bram directed you somewhere and say this is what you need to do amen we living our life peacefully but never take your eyes off from the coming of the Lord whatever you do do it but remember the Lord is coming where wherever whenever he's going to find you whether he find you at work or at home or sleeping just make sure you be ready amen so we clear on that one I gave you four qut you are loaded you got north south east west you loaded so whoever is coming you can shoot in every direction amen you can intercept the missiles amen amen let's go to our scripture this morning it's Genesis 39 and let's get now deeper into the second garment Brother David can you give me a little bit the mic I just want to hear myself and save my voice amen glory to God praise be to the name of the Lord can you hear me okay okay thank you Jesus Genesis 39 verse1 if you thereare you can say amen amen those who were yesterday will catch this pretty much easier because the Lord was gracious to you we teach people about spiritual things by the message cover everything we need to teach you how to interact with the world over there because you don't sleep in church amen you don't stay here amen you work somewhere else and where you working everybody's not message believer that's right in McDon everybody's not message believer so you need to know how to interact with the word and still remain Christian God didn't create a separate world for message believer sir come on no sir no sir amen amen God put you in the midst of everything for a reason amen amen amen amen glory to God verse one and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Piper a Christian no you might be seated was party a Christian no not he was not was he a Hebrew no was he a believer of Jehovah no he was actually believing and worshiping ad that's right so the This Man Called p for amen he's a hidden amen amen he's not a message believer amen that's right let me put it that way he's not a message believer amen amen

Pharaoh amen amen amen very close the Bible says captain of the Guard an Egyptian not a Hebrew but let me put it this way an idolator somebody who has nothing to do with your religion who don't even if you ask him do you know brother Bram he say I don't even know who you talking about but God take you and put you under man amen amen amen he bought him of the hands of the ishmaelite which had brought him down there and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Christian no the Egyptian God put him under a hidden and AD worshiping so in the morning Joseph pray his way and pipar also pray to his ad are we together everybody's maning their own businesses Piper has a big image of raah where in the morning he's doing all the rituals and everything and Joseph also is worshipping the god of heaven and God begin to bless the hidden that's right that's right is my Bible different than yours no sir God begin to bless that hidden that is worshiping a false god god begin to bless him amen because of Joseph God didn't look at his religion no sir no sir this message is different my friend amen God didn't say okay because he's not a message believer I won't bless him if God can bless a hien because of a Son of God how much will God bless a Son of God because of a Son of God amen amen amen are we together amen if a heathen can be blessed without are being converted how much more a child of God right am amen am wake up my friend amen we living below our privileges amen the Bible says and his master so that the Lord was with him a heathen amen acknowledge God through Joseph so God came with Joseph amen amen God came to this house with Joseph you take Joseph off you take God off that's right on amen amen because when God send you remember last Sunday he goes with you and he is also in you amen are we together amen the Bible say and his master so that the Lord was with him and the Lord made some of all all that he did to prosper in his head question Joseph was working for who Piper did he had a bank account for himself no he was a slave he cannot even open a bank account a Bank of America that's on Amen all his work

to pass from the time that he had made him Overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord bless Joseph no sir the Egyptians the Lord bless who the Egyptians house so don't be surprised that a business is working good that's where you are working amen amen are we together amen yes sir yes sir that's exactly if maybe Amazon is opening place is because you work there I know you won't believe me you will say no bezo is more intelligent that's what you think sir amen amen the Lord blessed the Egyptian house for Joseph what sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the what field every business that this man had was blessed amen why didn't God bless Jacob why didn't God bless Jacob when Joseph was leing thereus why why that potential never

hands in Joseph's hand and he knew not anything he had save the what the bread which he did eat only his food and Joseph was a goodly person handsome and well favored amen amen verse 7 and he came to pass after this thing that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said lie with him the one who want to destroy Joseph was not somebody outside sir no sir the very wife of the owner amen want Joseph to compromise on his Integrity toward Piper amen that's right the boy show himself to be loyal amen amen but P for wife came to make him compromise disloyalty the Bible continue and says but he refused and said to his master's wife behold my master knows not what is with me in the house and he had committed did all that he had in my hand there is none greater in this house than I neither has he kept back anything from me but who Thee I know my limitation I know where I need to go and where I start where I stop I cannot compromise against my master I cannot do that this is what he's telling the wife I cannot do that I have to stay firm and loyal to this man he told me don't touch my wife don't touch my wife touch everything I'm doing everything according to his command amen amen

Throne the Father and Jesus are how one and the husband and the wife are how one he didn't say you're going to sit beside me as a queen my Throne you going to sit in my Throne because when Adam was walking he was walking with Eve am amen amen Adam was walking with a woman in him amen hallelujah amen I'm going to say this not in a sacrilegious way he was pregnant with his wife [Music] [Applause] amen am and he have to give birth to his own wife you have a problem with that it happened to Jesus At The Cross we already went through that that's why the P Jesus right here they had to make a csection am a csection without Ania am and walk up water and water because somebody was giving birth [Applause] amen amen born of a woman is how but a man born of a man is how now a man born of a woman is how days but a man born of a man is how [Applause] etal that's why we Eternal amen you have no beginning of days amen no ending of life amen because we are under the lineage of meis Amen no beginning of there no ending of life you have to be born by Christ Have I Lost somebody have I lost someone let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us Lord this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given us father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you move me completely out of the way way may you be the one Speaking the one interpreting and may you bless us and may the devil be completely out in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen glory to God my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph five garment part8 amen we have established this five garment in Joseph the first garment if you can help me quickly is the Garment of many colors the second one is what servant the servant or a slave the third one is what prisoner the Garment of a prisoner we are on the second garment here the fourth one is what the Garment to appear before Pharaoh amen amen you heard that somebody say that amen and the fifth one is what fine lining fine lining amen and we found out that crust also went through this garment amen this is what we established last Sunday that Jesus Christ went through every single garment amen and today we are still dealing with the second garment which is the Garment of a slave and we establish to you clearly that Jesus Christ also came down and he became a servant amen he was a servant to Jehovah himself amen amen amen and if you notice at the end of that garment that garment was taken away from Joseph amen and he was never given back to Joseph amen are we together do you want to see it or you know the story the wife for part for kept the Garment up to the evening and that garment was not given to Joseph and we found out spiritually speaking that Jesus Lost His Garment in the garden of geston you remember last Sunday but in the natural also something happened to the Lord Jesus Christ according to John chap 19:23 the Bible say then the soldier when they had crucify who Jesus they took what his garments and made for part to every Soldier a part and also his what coat now the coat was how without seeing woven from the top throughout they say therefore among them themselves the soldier let us not what R it but cast lot for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be what fulfilled which says they parted my what reignment among them and for my vure they did what C these things did what the soldiers so Jesus Lost His Garment His Garment was taken and given to the soldier and the soldier ped His Garment why because that step was completed in his life and when he resurrected where did he get his garment let me continue my subject my friend amen amen amen His Garment was taken to the soldier the soldier took the Garment and take it home because the second garment have to be taken out but when Jesus Christ was cify he was naked amen that's what the Bible says amen but when he resurrected he was not resurrected naked amen God knows how to provide amen even if they strip you from everything he's the God of creation amen he can make clothing better than the clothing of a man amen and God provided a clothing for his own son amen because Jesus Christ don't change he is Jehovah jarra amen on the top of a mountain he can create a realm amen he's the god of creation amen you don't have to worry how they bury you the problem is how you going to come out amen you can bury me any kind you want to bury me that's not the problem the problem I'm going to come out am and when I come out I'm going to have not only a new body but a new clothing amen am amen everybody together are we together amen we found out that when he came out from the grave amen the Bible says in Philippian that he receive a new name amen that's right we went through that last Sunday amen he received a new name and we found out that the new name was only Jesus Christ amen how can Jesus be a a new name of God when the name of God was already Jesus Christ we explain to you that what happened is a Jesus in a different Revelation amen everybody okay the same the name remain the same but the Revelation is different that's why brother Bram says this in the Feast of the trumpet brother brandham say the angel of the Lord appear and told about the Seven Seals that I was to return back here to what Jeffersonville and preach what the Seven Seals there if I have ever said anything that was inspired it was in what that there where the angel of the Lord met us and the Bible became what a new Bible the Bible didn't change the version hey oh sir everybody okay brother Bram never make a new Bible he was still the same old Bible but he became a new Bible the Bible is still the same but it's a new Bible the name is still Jesus Christ but is's a new [Applause] Jesus Brother David give me volume on my monitor so I don't have to worry about have I say something difficult let me start it again the Bible is the same brother Bram never came up with a new Bible brother Bram took the old Bible and he preached it through but brother Bram say when the angel came his Bible became a new Bible the name of the pr did not change the cover of the Bible did not change the color of the Bible did not change but the Revelation amen of the Bible this is what become completely new Amen brother Bram say and the Bible became a what a new Bible there it did what opened up and reveal what all the things that the reformer and things has done what had left out it was a what the complete revelation of Jesus Christ all together new to us he was still Jesus Christ but the Revelation new to us amen something new that you never knew before amen everybody okay it was complete revelation of who Jesus Christ all together how new to us but how perfectly exactly with the scriptures he will never contradict the Bible but it's something new that you never seen before amen and brother Bram say that was the what word which has always been and he was so inspired and what and directed you need to know under which Jesus you are worshiping Jesus amen I am responsible to this church and I'm talking to this church we can say Jesus but we saying different Jesus am I'm letting this soak in before I drop it okay let me nail you in the scripture my friend let's go to Second Corinthian before somebody lose a wing somewhere amen amen let's go to Second Corinthian because if I don't nail this we need to understand who we are right amen amen amen let's go to 2 Corinthian chapter 11 I'm sorry chapter 11 if you can you can say Amen when you get there amen amen amen I don't know my monitor is very low yeah the volume is all the way up so I hear myself very very low amen amen usually when I put it up I'm you almost I have almost like bursting amen verse four if you dare you can say amen amen for if we clear now amen he that cometh preaches what another Jesus not are we reading together yes sir preach is what another Jesus not another man another Jesus uhhuh it is still Jesus but it's another one amen am I reading a different Bible no sir it is Jesus but it's not the same Jesus we spoke amen so me and you can say Jesus Jesus but we are talking different amen when I say in the name of Jesus Christ and you say in the name of Jesus Christ we are saying the same thing but we not truly saying the same thing Amen Let me put it home when a Baptist say in Jesus name when a Catholic say in Jesus name amen when a said believer say in Jesus name we are saying different Jesus amen the cathol for him Jesus is the son of God he is the second person in the deity he is the little body that was in a Manger that was carried by Mary so the Catholic that is his Jesus but my Jesus is different amen the Jehovah of the Old Testament amen is the Lord Jesus Christ am me and my father we are one that's why the devil obey me amen but doesn't obey the C amen amen amen are we together amen are we together amen so you need to have the revelation of Jesus Christ according to the time you living in amen everybody together amen because the devil knows amen when you say Jesus brother uh the Paul say for if he comes and preaches what another Jesus whom who we have what not preach so Paul preached Jesus somebody else can preach Jesus but we are preaching two different Jesus let me put it home everybody that is Christian in this City carry the Bible That's Right amen amen if you go on YouTube right now all the churches around us are reading the Bible that's perfect Brother David amen amen they are all reading the Bible but the way we preach the Bible and the way they preach the Bible are different amen because our Bible is preached by the message of the hour amen their Bible is preached through Creeds and dogma uhhuh and whatever the way whichever way you preach the Bible will bring a spirit on people amen can I can I talk can I continue listen to the verse my friend I'm trying to quickly move on but you pulling me in a different direction the Bible says for if we preach and are what Jesus whom we have not what preach or if you receive another what spirit so you can receive another spirit and you think it's the Holy Ghost but it's a religious spirit amen amen he bring you to church uhhuh but he doesn't change your life amen I'm going to get in the message my friend I'm going to dwell in the message church because it's very easy to Target the Presbyterian to Target the Pentecost to Target the Baptist I don't have time for that brother I'm already did that my Ministry deal with the message amen and the message setting amen because the people of God must be free amen we must be free from denomination in the message amen no denomination outside the message in the message we got Baptist in this message we got Methodist in the message let me continue my friend if we receive another What Spirit which you have not what received or another what gospel which you have not what accepted you must do what well bear with him so you can preach another Jesus that is different than what Paul is preaching amen so Paul is preaching Jesus you are preaching Jesus but we too are preaching two different Jesus amen amen amen but listen to this let's go to the book of act let's put home in the message churches glory to God this is better now let me blast this devil let's go to act 19 if you dare you can say amen amen act Chapter 19 Verse 13 glory to God the Bible say then certain of the vagabon Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which have a what evil spirits the name of the Lord who Jesus they are using the name of the Lord Jesus very good they even call him Lord Jesus saying we adure you by the Jesus who whom Paul preached so according to the way they approach they approach Jesus according to the preaching of Paul amen everybody okay amen Jesus correct according to the preaching of Paul correct but the devil resisted them am am everybody okay you can bring Jesus according to William May bruh and the devil might resist you amen because you got a problem you and the message are not one amen you are using the message on your lips but the message is not in the heart amen your message came to change the heart if you and the message are not United the devil won't heal you amen do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me amen the Bible says that and they were seven sons of CA a Jew a chief of the priest which did so and the evil spirit answered M we clear and say to them what Jesus I know I know Jesus come and who Paul I know and no William Mar Bram but what who are ye you need to know who you are so it's not enough being in the message church amen it is not enough grow up in the message Church the problem is being in Christ amen if you in Christ and you and the message become one then you can speak Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the message of the hour and the devil must obey you because you got a revelation of who Jesus is for this present time not the Jesus of Luther not the Jesus of Wesley but the Jesus of this through the ministry of Malachi amen which open the seals and unfold a new revelation of Jesus Christ allog together new but perfectly in line with the scripture amen are we together amen are we together so when you say Jesus what are you saying which Jesus are you talking about a man with a beard okay we believe that one but which Jesus are you talking about what Revelation what understanding do you have on that Jesus that you're talking about the level of the revelation will determine the power there it is amen that will back you up and back your word based on the revelation of Jesus Christ amen and when the seals broke brother Bram say a new revelation completely new open up that's why brother brandham says this he say I'm looking for a time of a what a Break Forth of that of the what the spirit of God in these last days where we are now living in for another sege of what the Holy Spirit into the what the church the Holy Spirit was already in the church but you need another search of the Holy Spirit you you need a second oil am you need a second oil and oil different to take you to the bridegroom am not the all you started with it amen amen but the all that was open up by the midnight shout amen because it's the midnight shout that open the second o it is the message of William Mar Bram that unfold a new revelation a new anointing a new name of God all together new to us but perfectly in line with the Bible am that's why the message and the Bible i w amen am and I search of the what into what the church for what a rapturing faith so rapturing Faith doesn't come with the old church no sir no sir can you say Amen the faith to change your body in a twinking of an eye need another Revelation amen he need another surge of the Holy Spirit he need something higher than Paul higher than Luther amen higher than Pentecost amen something in a different level a Capstone Revelation amen finality amen the capping Stone of Jesus Christ himself everybody okay everybody okay just before he comes and everything is sitting how straight in order for I believe that we are living now at the time that what the word should have preeminence what should have the preeminence the word word which word the word that broke the seals amen because that's the word that revealed the new name and brother BR said that name was revealing the tunder amen and the tund where the Revelation under the seal amen so without the T no ruring amen glory glory glory glory glory I believe that the time to lay aside what our Creed and our what our thoughts and come back to what the word let's go back to the message of let's go back to the opening of the SE amen let's go back to what William Marion Bram left us because that's the only message that have been Vindicated qualified to prepare you to change you to M you to train you to equip you for the coming of the Lord without that message you stay in the grave amen hallelujah are we together are we together no bullet are fing everywhere but everything is okay so far amen hallelujah amen hallelujah let's get into our sermon this morning my friend Glory Glory Glory Glory to God hallelujah everybody good Shake somebody's hand and say God richly bless you as we we are soaring over there you can take your seat belt we already up in the air then uh you can look at the cloud and everything that's okay as we continue soaring with uh to that destination Captain Jesus Christ is uh uh taking care of this flight and assistant Captain brother Stephen is beside him so we moving in the right direction everybody okay so far glory to God the flight attended are good everything is okay amen glory to God Amen let's give the Lord a big clap offering brother Bram says when he got tension upon the people he will put a sense of humor to relax them so as a as a assistant Commander here I have to know how to set the church and stretch you up a little bit while I'm wiping my face and somebody also is stretching himself as we get getting ready to suck in the way amen okay amen okay it's a symphony we're playing like a keyboard okay and we're moving forward God when you are born in this world got a purpose for you come on brother amen amen amen God appointed you to something amen before you are born by your mother God appointed you to something you have a mission come on you have a place you have a destination you have a position amen that you had before the foundation of the world do you follow me am amen Amen brother Bram says this glory to God in the message adoption part one he says the church positionally when by brother before the foundation of the world when God in his what labor pain so when I say man giving birth somebody someone maybe have a problem with me the quot is there God gave birth amen uhhuh God in his what labor pain so God also was crying like Mama uhhuh okay God in his what labor pain was what bringing forth bringing forth who you knowing what you would do he did what positionally plac you into his own body to be a what a housewife to be a what a farmer to be a what a preacher to be a what a prophet to be what this or to be that he places you how position so before you are born into through your mother God already have you birth somewhere amen are we together are we together are we clear together somewhere you were already born and when you are born there is a purpose that is attached to you everybody okay there is a Destin ation that is attached to you amen if you look at the image over there we found out that Joseph was born and Joseph already was 17 years old amen amen and then at 17 years old God gave him the vision that he had before he was born amen are we together so sometime your Revelation may come before you are born that's it time before Jesus Christ was born that's right amen his Revelation came that Mary you going to have a son you will call his name Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Revelation came before he was born when the majors were coming to see the Lord Jesus Christ they were not coming to see a baby sir they were coming to honor a king because when they got there they say where is the king of the Jews but the King was not King yet he was born King but he was still a baby amen are we together amen so Jesus was born Emmanuel he was born the king but when he birth he's not in the throne yet are we together amen are we together am he has to go through a process [Applause] before he reached the position that God ordained him to be before you were born there was already a plan for you that plan may be revealed to you before you are born somebody might prophesy to your mother before you are born yes sometime that plan might be revealed to you after you are born right and when you steal a baby and they're going to talk to your parent like the parent of Samson are we together are we together sometime your plan may be revealed to you when you are already in there amen Jesus amen amen amen what I'm trying to say is we got five garment sometime your Revelation can be revealed on zero when you are not born sometime you might be already in the second stage and God comes to reveal to you amen sometime you might be on level four and that is when God comes to reveal to you yes amen amen amen the purpose of this Revelation is to tell you that you have a position do you follow me do you follow me and this Revelation give you landmarks are we together put your seat belt this Revelation

unveiling to you your life Journey Through the five Garment of Joseph God is unveiling to you the landmark of your life amen in other word when you begin to look at what happened to Joseph and you look at your life and you begin to see hey he was rejected I was also rejected so you know that you going into the right direction am if somebody criticize him I was also criticized that means I'm going into the right direction if falsely accuse him they are doing that for me it means you need to get excited amen meaning you are going to the right direction amen do you follow me do you follow me brother Bram had a vision and God told him when you go to a certain house to pray for a baby you will see this and this and this and this and this when you see those things happen and a grar entering by the back door and sitting down somewhere that's the time you need to pray for the baby amen so brother will enter your house and begin to talk to you as he's talking to you he's looking

that matches this garment it's telling you where you are amen what step you already fulfilled where you moving but you are guaranteed you going to go into a throne amen even though today it's humiliation tomorrow it's going to be glorification am even though today is rejection tomorrow something is good so when people begin to back bite about you you don't get upset because it's a good Landmark according to the landmark I must be rejected I must be falsely accused I must be hated I must see jealousy when I see jealousy I'm on the right hole when I see disappointment I'm on the right hle when I see rejection I'm on the right Ro the more trial that are coming the more headache that are coming it is only a son of your right direction amen you heading towards something big amen something big that God ordained for you amen so this should give you a consolation it should give you a courage it should give you a hope that I'm going on the right track am amen everybody okay everybody okay no rejection you don't match Joseph no false accusation you don't match Joseph if you are not guilty and you falsely accuse you say praise the Lord ah whatever happen in Jesus Christ is happening to me I have the Holy Ghost I understand now that I'm troubling the devil because he begin to attack me thinking I'm Jesus Christ so the isas come confusion between me and Jesus Christ I am M Jesus Christ that's why I receive the attack of Jesus Christ so never lose hope and never cry everything is working together [Applause] for any question any question the footstep of the righteous are ordered by who the Lord that have been said Paul says this glory to God in Hebrew 1 verse one he said God who at SRA times and in ders many manners spake in the past unto who the fathers by who the prophets has in this last day spoken to us by who his son his this last day he chose the son s o n amen whom he had what appointed appointed what heir of all things stop if you look he didn't say whom he has did you see that he didn't say whom he has like it's today that God decided that okay I'm going to give Jesus Christ to be the hair no he was his it's something that was done in the past he has appointed so Jesus Christ was already right in the past appointed predestinated amen prepared orain to be here amen this Jesus that is here amen is 100% God Amen everybody okay and he's 100% Man follow me carefully the god of Jesus Christ don't learn anything the god part of Jesus Christ doesn't need [Applause] training I I wish I can get where I'm going but the main part of Jesus Christ need to go through Joseph [Applause] G that's why he behove him to be made like one of us amen that's why he was made flesh his flesh went through the same process that me and you are going but God doesn't need training because it's God who created everything God have no beginning no ending he was Elohim the one who existed by himself but the son had a beginning that's why they could kill Jesus Christ but they cannot kill God before they killed Jesus Christ God came out of Jesus [Applause] Christ you got to be in the message of the in the garden of G God removed Jesus Christ and came out of Jesus Christ that's why Jesus said my father my father why has that what forsaken because God came out you cannot kill God you can kill the man Jesus Christ that's why Jesus is a Kingsman Redeemer the perfect one who can understand our trouble the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of what infirmity any problem so far have I lost somebody let's continue to clam Paul says this Hallelujah he says whom he has appointed what heir of all things heir of what all things by whom also he has made what the world so the air of everything that God's Own is Jesus Christ am everybody can say Amen to that let's jop to the second level on Roman 8:16 the Bible say the spirit the Holy Ghost itself do what beareth Witness with what our spirit I thought I'm going to go quickly that's for some reason somebody's pulling this is your body amen this is your spirit you know that and this is what soul your soul in there we got what SE the Holy Ghost come and sit here amen amen if you notice the spirit is not talking to the soul please verify the spirit of the Lord doesn't talk to the soul because he's in the soul the soul and the Holy Ghost have fused together that's why you got an eternal Soul amen everybody okay amen amen amen amen the spirit is talking to who our spirit to your spirit because that is where your greatest battle let me let me go slowly my friend your soul hander your heart everybody okay who control his breathing brother Angel do you control how your heartbeat whether you want it or not you will hear him he doesn't care about you if you singing he's going on he's on with him if you sleeping he has he's on with him if you laughing that's your problem you can even get upset the heart don't care whether you upset or not he continues that's it in other words somebody is monitoring you without you being and I mean conscience of it amen can I continue can I continue spoken word you pulling me to a different avenue this is not what I prepare somebody's pulling when you get a sandwich huh when you put a sandwich in your in your hand you manage the sandwich you say this is a juicy sandwich hopefully somebody's not getting hungry okay and when you bite the sandwich you the one chewing on it you're chewing left and right you determine how long you want to keep it if you want to keep it like a lollipop it's your problem and you play around with the food until you reach a point where you say no it's enough I must swallow it when you swallow the food the food loses your control amen are we together are we together whatever happened to that food you don't control it anymore who is channeling the food to your stomach you do you sit down and get something and say jop down jop down jop down to your B do you do that there is another another mention there is another system that take on over and begin to get the food and digest the food and pull nutrient from the food and take the waste and chel it somewhere until it goes into the Dr everybody okay everybody okay so that problem is usually easy to solve the problem is your brain are we together then the heart is order by the soul but your spirit is the one that control your brain yes everybody okay so the Holy Spirit doesn't have a problem with your automation amen when you sleep you completely unconscious how do you breathe how do you how do you control that I'm squeezing my hand I need to change this way do you remember how many time you flip on the bed there is somebody monitoring that there is somebody telling your hand that hey you squeezing the hand here you need to change position and that person trigger you and you go up this way it is not you it is another [Applause] you that you is your soul amen that's the one you see in the dream that's the one that fight with the devil on the dream and you are sleeping daddy and he look like you he look like you he does stuff like you he even remember what you did throughout the [Applause] day I'm sorry there a the case was an emergency bullet but now I found out there was a problem in the kidneys so I'm in a kidney surgery okay okay are we together so the problem with the soul is not a big deal because usually you don't control that God control everything everybody okay the problem is with your brain and the one that operate your brain is your spirit that is where the devil attack you the greatest B ever t is where that's why the Holy Spirit talk to your brain he talk to your spirit because your spirit doubts too much your spirit reason too much your soul doesn't reason your soul say I believe the message of William Mar Bram where they understand or not brother Bram is a true Prophet that's say your spirit say well but they say brother Bram was copying things but they say that's your that's why when the Holy Ghost come in you he talk to your spirit amen and say yes in your spirit [Applause] amen listen you Spirit you the one that make this daugh doubt all the time every time she start she say I don't know if I'm a Child of God with everything that is happening to you I don't know if I'm a Child of God so God said the spirit when the spirit Enter he turn around to your spirit it a spirit to Spirit talk a spirit and a spirit talk so the spirit knows what the spirit is and the two Spirits begin to talk and the Holy Ghost tell your spirit tell him what can I continue can I continue he says the spirit of God beareth what witness to our spirit that what we are the children of God so the Holy Ghost got to make sure your brain is now by the fact that you a child of God not because of what you doing not because of what you did not because you were brought up in the message church but because before the foundation of the [Applause] world before the children were born have not done good or evil I love [Applause] Jacob everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so the Holy Ghost come to you and say to your spirit listen you are a child of God you you are a child of God and your spirit say healing with everything I'm doing say yes sister Bruce you are a child of God sister BR said brother I make so mistake he said that's not what I'm looking at you are a child of God the Holy Ghost keep your spirit and subjection to the word of God spirit this is my daughter you are my daughter no matter what happened remember you are my daughter that's why I'm inside of you to remind you that you are mine [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody good he said the spirit beareth what witness to what with our spirit not somebody else Spirit your spirit that you are what the children of God so we found out that children of God is Not only Jesus Christ [Music] amen Jesus Christ the son of God Jesus Christ the child of God unto us a child is born but God have more than one child I'm reading to you the Bible Jesus was a child of God but here the Bible say God has also children if the first son was God the other son must be God because God only give birth to God Amen this message is very simple it is not complicated the message of brother Bram is very simple it will penetrate even the elementary Bo can I continue can I continue so now we found out that Jesus the son is not the only son God has other children amen amen if God has other children they must have also a portion of inheritance come on there is there is oh [Applause] Lord this is your sermon my friend I am right here so you blocking me from pushing down amen amen God Jesus Christ is air air of what my friend can you read it on Hebrew air of what he owns what he owns everything so he took everything he gave it to who to Jesus Christ but he has ADD children what are we getting Daddy what am I getting you took everything you give it to him why what about me what am I getting what am I getting what am I getting if Jesus Christ God got everything what am I getting there is nothing left we are not Esau Esau when they give to Jacob they have pretty much nothing can I continue the Bible says this he says the spirit bear itself what witness to our spirit that we are what the children of God if children uhhuh then we are [Applause] what so the heir of God is not one [Applause] person so Jesus is not the only heir of God now the children of God they also are amen am Jesus own everything so we air to what there are air they are then what hirs heir of what of God I thought the heir of God was Jesus Christ yes heir of God come and then what joint HS with Christ so whatever Jesus Christ own he does own it [Applause] himself are we together whatever Jesus Christ have he owns it with me we are join in other word when God was making Jesus Son the peer there were two [Music] signature there was a line that say groom and they put date do you follow I'm going this way so he soak and Jesus came with his blood he said Jesus Christ date April 21st 2024 but there was another land that was called spouse and they put dat amen and when they finish they say thank you Jesus you can pass but this property is joint it is own by a joint they say you come also and you stand below Jesus Christ and you say my name is Sheron Sho now you are joined amen you are husband and wife that's why brother BR I'm say a woman is air to everything her husband has not your uncle your wife I have the C follow me carefully your uncle don't own what you have amen your mother don't own what you have your wife you are baby together your wife is the one that get everything because you are jointed [Applause] amen can I continue amen if Jesus CED that's why Jesus said whoever overcome will sit with me where in my Throne because you are joined if Jesus have a throne I must have a throne amen amen are we going together amen and my Throne is going to be his throne amen because whatever he does there is two signature [Applause] Amen brother Bram say many times he said when a Believer is Born Again God give him what a checkbook that is sign by what by Jesus Christ and he gave it to the believer to do what to sign it can you fill up a check if your name is not I mean Incorporated in a bank sir if you have a right to write a check it means that in the bank your name is also there amen if God is giving you a checkbook it means in heaven your name are written in heaven Amen in the Lamb's Book of Life amen that's why when the disciple were rejoicing Jesus said don't Rejoice for that Rejoice because in heaven in the bank account your name is listed in when your checkbook come and they look at they say approve bring the found because your name is in [Applause] there this will change your prayer it will change your conception of yourself it will change the way you look at yourself you are not a nobody you are somebody in Christ amen are we together hey my God the Bible says that if so if so be that we do what suffer with him then we may be also how glorified together because of that word whatever happened to Jesus Christ yes sir must happen to us and if we under go something because of Jesus Christ we are Duty bound to come out with the same result amen that Jesus did if Jesus died and was glorified if you die you must be glorify that's why even our body when our body will be changed we will have a body like who like who so when you see Jesus Christ you will see somebody that look like you because you and him are one in the Rapture you final product if you look at Jesus Christ you say what kind of body you have Jesus say look at your body also me and you are the same that's why me and you can get married that's why me and you can live in the same place that's why me and you can R together because whatever speak of the groom speak of the Bride are we together father help me let me try he says therefore bro Paul says if ye be where Christ if you belong to Christ then you are what Abraham SE and you are what HS according to the promise you are as according to what the promise wherein God willing more what abundantly to show unto the what HS of Promise these hairs are not Jesus Christ MTI multiple HS this is not Jesus Christ God want to show to you air of the promise the what the immutability of his counsel do you know what he means do you know what it means immutability means the god that will not change what he thought about you so God want the air to know that whatever I have in mind for you I will never change my mind about you if God say you going to be a farmer nobody even if they close the farmer shop you will be the only Farmer in the city amen so God to show you that whatever he made you to be won't change he so with [Applause] enough not you because you can change he himself he so with enough God say h I'm sorry I'm just trying to make a point you will forgive me you will forgive me will you forgive me God says in other word on my dead body right I'm just trying to make a point in other word god P his that whatever I have said about you I will never change Amen in other word you can never become but what God orain you to [Applause] be oh so because my vision is that people will bow down to me you can put me on a pit it won't change me you can put me on a part for house he won't change me you can put me in a prison it will never change my d it's actually working together toward my [Applause] destiny what a consolation my friend where are you going my friend understanding the principle of hair there is something that goes with hair Paul says this he says that a hair as long as he's what a child that's what nothing from a servant how can you take a baby and give him a kingship Jesus is born out of Mary he's a baby crying and he's born what king of the Jews do you take a baby and go on the throne and give it to him he doesn't even know how to talk a there when he's a child he's what not different than a slave the word to Servant there means slave he's not different than a slave in other words when you are born and you are immature do you follow me God put you in the Garment of a slave of a servant amen but remember you own something you have a position you are air to something you were send in this world to fulfill something but God cannot give you that thing a birth when you ride away you born when you growing up God cannot give it to you then you're not ready for that yet what does God do my friend glory to God Paul says he def nothing from what a servant though he be what Lord of all so even though you are treated as a servant it doesn't mean you're not Lord of all Amen in other word your present condition does not change what God already made for you your present condition have a time he have a frame of time that God is put you through that condition but whatever you own still remain valid that's right are we together and Paul say he deth nothing from what a servant though he be what Lord of all but is under what tutors and what and Governor until the what time appointed of the father so God take you and put you on the tutor he put you on Mentor he put put you under a governor to prepare you for the task ahead I wish I can even touch the Garment of Jesus Christ you see how God prepared Jesus Christ listen to this the disciple were following Jesus Christ when they follow Jesus Christ Jesus Christ look at them and say go pray for the sick go preach the gospel they begin to preach cast devil they came up happy everything and finally something begin to come with them they say okay we are how many of us are we are 12 okay someday this man will go this man won't stay here we fast forever okay if he goes who's going to take over human who's going to take over when Jesus die who's going to be the big sha who's going to take over and when Jesus Christ heard them he tells them this Lord help me he says whosoever of you will be the what the chiefest in other word whoever want to be the greatest shall be what servant of all you missing a point you want to be on the top the top the way up okay he said for even the who the son of man came not to what to be ministered unto but to do what to minister in other words you miss a point disciple I'm a boss I was born King but did you see me acting as a king I came in the Garment of a servant normally I should be sitting and people serve me but you don't see me serving being served I am the one actually serving the people but you are going too quickly to the throne you don't go to the throne too quickly like that you need to press through the G of a servant before you reach the throne they never gave Jesus a new name until he finishes the Garment the Bible says in luk for wether is greater he that sth where at me or he that do what that Ser is not he that sth in meat because he's the boss but I am among you as what he that serve did you see me coming bragging no when I sit down with you I'm the one opening the microwave and warming food and begin to say B tell me this is your food hey Peter this is your hamburger normally I should be sitting and you the one doing all these things Lord help me up and Jesus says in John 20 13 so after he has done what washed their feet and he had taken what His Garment and he did what was set down and he say unto them know ye what I done to you in other way do you understand what I'm trying to teach before honor come humility amen he says what have I done to you he he call me what master and lordy according to the scripture was a master of Joseph he call me master and what and Lord ownership amen and he said well what you're saying is correct amen so I am if I then your what your lord and what and master have done what washed your feet ye also ought to do what wash one another because the Garment Jesus was operating on was a garment of a servant amen that's why Jesus had no problem watching the disciple fet because he was operating in a garment of EX he had no problem serving people he understood the time frame that the father gave it to him and he must go through that training amen because of the task that lay ahead brother pram says this he says the lowest paid flank of the whole group was what the foot washer the man who washed the feet was what the worst of all of them the what the lowest page so God took the lowest page job I'm going so I wish I can get because where where I'm trying to get I'm going to get even in your work with this government even in your work in your job and pull up from there amen amen the the biggest one humble himself became human he didn't stop there he humble himself begin to serve human he didn't stop there he looked he said among the human being what is the lowest pay job they say it's the one who washes the feet he said that's what I'm going to take and Jesus goes and sit down and start washing the feet listen my friend if I can uh my time is gone he says now I want to say something to you Jesus Took the what the lowest place a what a flunky Hallelujah that proved to me he was what God so a God doesn't have a problem to take the lowest place amen Jesus said even if you go to a party don't go to a big place sit for the back first let the people come and say Hey brother stepen you cannot sit here you need to sit over there but don't take the big place what is he telling us he said Jesus Took the lowest place of flank Hallelujah that proved to me he was what God he took what the lowest place to do what to wash feet he had all kinds of what of flunkies but the lowest one was the what a foot washer washing the what that manure everything of what their feet the lowest what flunky there was and Jesus Took the lowest flunky then you are so stiff you can't do what nothing for him but he took what the lowest place for you he was a what a foot washer think of it the king of what Glory became what a foot washer to show what humility and to give you an example on what to do and how to do it the Garment of a servant listen to this my friend brother Bram say when a g they got a what a flunky the what the poorest paid man on the job when I think that my Lord guarded himself and did water wash people's feet he took the water the lowest place he deserved the water the highest place but he took what the lowest place to do what to wash the dong and the what dirt from the feet become what the humblest servants the humblest of a servant Jesus Christ there is not another servant got as what humble a job of as the what the flunky that washes the feet what is he trying to show you under this time frame of this Garment of a servant Jesus who was God didn't mind the position God gave him amen there it is there it is amen whatever God say do Jesus did it Jesus was God Jesus was King Jesus was the highest but which have position you give it to him he will take it without [Applause] argument don't worry my friend Lord help me up David says in the book

master did you see me serving yes I was serving you did you see me sitting on the chair and say hey and the battler is bringing stuff he he was the B he was the baker he was the one bringing for he was the one that have been ministering unto the people because he knew the disciple down the road a power is coming on them on the day of Pentecost they're going to receive a power from onai and they will be doing what Jesus was doing so Jesus have to mold them to train them to understand really how to manage the God kingdom Joseph your job is Big your power is Big whatever you going to inherit is big I cannot take you straight from Israel and put you on the throne it's a disaster I cannot take you as a young child and put you a king it's a disaster you got to grow to a process and in that

remember brother Bram say you're going to come up like a butterfly with a wrong Wing because you dodge a step you won't know how to fly that's why we have a big head in this message people you can teach nothing you can say nothing you cannot change them you cannot teach them anything because they already put so much in their head they know everything they don't learn from nobody God won't never put something like that that's [Music] I will show you even how God molded brother Bram because he knew the third pool is coming God never brought brother Bram and gave him the third pool never God brought brother Bram and said William Bram first Po and he made mistake and God Sav second p and he made mistake God you see every time I'm telling you not to do something you keep doing now the third one I will see how you going to make mistake I handle it myself you you see what I'm saying if he would have given brother brandham the third pool the first time what would have happened that's why God is doing that whatever you looking for whatever your marriage your what whatever you're doing if you understand the training you under right now what God is doing right now if you just can humble yourself not to brother Steven to the word if you humble yourself you will find out how quick God as soon as you pass the stest he move you to the next step amen and before you know it you're going to be a great somebody because what you have is bigger what you have is dangerous the position you have is dangerous if God give it to you right now you're going to make a disaster you won't listen to
