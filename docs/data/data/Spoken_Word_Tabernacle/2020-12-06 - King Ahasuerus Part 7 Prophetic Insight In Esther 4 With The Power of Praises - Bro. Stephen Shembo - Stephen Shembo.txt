help me know you help me know your right here hallelujah hallelujah thank you sister zad Hallelujah you know uh I like the part where the men sing where he he talks about uh to feel the warmth of your Embrace I mean you know for a man you know embracing or whatever but um I always felt like the song was special because it gave the men that part it just it's just uh to imagine Embrace from God you know now this next one um I kind of felt led to sing this from I don't know I've had it on my heart for a while I was trying to find a song and somebody may be able to help me it's from years ago it says I wasn't there when they did you know several things but I was you know this one is were you there and you know typically we always kind of sang it around Easter but today is Resurrection Day anyways and and until I find the other song I just kind of felt a little bit led to sing this one this morning uh we won't sing all the verses of it but you know there's just there's just I might not have been there for a lot of things to see a lot of things I didn't witness the red getting parted but I was there I didn't get to see Jesus nailed to the tree I didn't I wasn't a witness to that I can't take you to a cross I can't I might be able to take you to the vicinity of it if we go to Jerusalem on the hill of gotha but I was there and when he raised from the grave I was there I didn't see it but I didn't have to see it there's something in my heart know true it's the same thing with this message I didn't see everything I didn't I was four years old when brother brandom died but God's grace is big enough and it was sufficient to bring me in when I was about 30 you know so to me I didn't have to see those things I know that they and I know this message changed my life and I'm the evidence of the message you are the evidence that it's true and it's real and it's Jesus Christ because nobody else could have such a profound effect so if I can compose myself again we'll sing this song I think it's a d I'm not positive so y'all help me y'all know the song Were You There When They Crucified My [Music] Lord Were You There When They crui my Lord [Music] sometimes it causes me

this morning thank you all and greet all our family members that came this morning God richly bless you when I say family member means we don't have visitors in this church we have family member you home with Brothers and sooner we're going to stand over there in heaven and stay for eternity never to depart anymore and we're going to have one church is be in the city and everybody will be there amen you might be seated for a minute last Wednesday we had a wonderful wonderful wonderful sermon the hand of the diligent if you miss that I will encourage you whether you young people old people whichever age you are go ahead and listen to that sermon at the end I made a comment and I gave my own example how I went to school and I I was traveling for four years and I was giving that example to just back up the brother and to show that it takes diligence to reach a c certain goal so we're not here to put oursel up like we Big Shot there is no big shot in this church the only one is the Lord Jesus Christ amen so I just want the church to understand when we bring an example when we talk about Brother David doing something brother Michael doing something or sometime I might bring my own example that's the reason why I say we are boasting in the Lord so whatever we do we're doing that in the Lord amen if we accomplish something in this life we did it by the grace of God Amen there is always cou of scripture that comes back to me all the time and these are like the scriptures of My Life The Devil is fighting for nothing it's 1 Corinthians chapter 4:7 the Bible say for who maketh thee to die from one from another in other word who makes you different from somebody else and what has that that did not receive so there is nothing we have in this world we did not receive even though you think you work for it it is God that gave it to you amen and Paul continue he says now if that did receive it from the Lord why do thou Glory as if th has not receive it like I did this with my own power you didn't do that the one who gave you that strength is God the one who gave you that intelligence is God the one who gave you the job is God you can get fire anytime amen so whether we accomplish something here we did it by the grace of God Amen and Paul continues again in 2 Corinthians chapter 3:5 he says not that we are sufficient of ourself to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God so young people keep those scripture for your life whether you do something whether you accomplish something in this life always remember you did it by the grace of God you did it because of God if God would not have allowed you to have it no matter what you're going to do you're not going to get it amen so when we give example here always remember our pastor is giving example boasting in the Lord not to project myself because we don't want nothing else to be put in the heart of the people but the word brother Bram say that Minister preacher begin to puts in the heart of the people and that's the reason why when they deviate the people stay with the minister instead of staying with the word amen we don't want that in this church in this church we give preeminence to the word if the pastor leave the word him amen there's no game to that heaven and earth will pass away but my word amen let every man's word be a lie but only the word of God will be the truth Amen period in this church period that's why we preach the message purely amen where brother Brandon put a comma we put a comma where brother Brandon put a stop we put a stop where brother Bram clear his throat we clear our thought [Applause] amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah just be gracious with me on time let me preach amen how many receive a message from Living Word I did I did okay normally I don't pay attention to those kind of stuff brother Bram say Jesus walk UNC conscience of criticism but as a pastor a Shepherd I must say something amen and I'm talking to this church and to the people that are member of this church amen I didn't have any time to waste Amen to listen to those stuff because I know it's the same old version of the letter we gave in December amen you should have told the truth back then amen not wait up to now now for those who went and listen to those sermon those videos some of them report to me that there was a name of a minister here that was mentioned there that he brought a book to brother Tim and that was brother Kelly and I know it's the devil fighting back so I don't want to give time or room to the devil for people begin to question why did Brother Kelly give the book why did Brother Kelly give the book The Bible say when the first witness come they always give him reason but when the second come they question the first one amen so I'm going to give brother Kelly four or five minutes and let him tell you why he gave the book and if somebody ask you a question tell them to refer back to this amen and we clear that once for all brother Kelly come on there is a microphone up there amen you want to kill the devil that's how you kill the devil on Amen not the Lord go ahead brother I told y'all from the beginning I love whooping on the devil you see you can't trap the word let's go back and let's tell the whole truth now at the time when we were all there in one family you know I was a Watchman at one time you know when a deacon or someone is spiritual they watching a Watchman he watches before the enemy gets up on you that's right so when he came if something come to this church who would you go to First ah the enemy came and tried to come there living word brother Tim was my pastor at the time I came to brother Tim privately to show him what the enemy was coming with even the one who wrote the book my wife and I sat up under that Ministry for almost over 10 years or maybe even longer so you know what you were up against it's only like brother Steve said it was only by the grace of God so if you notice my wife and I knew nothing what was going on when it all happened and I didn't leave leave immediately and make sure he tell this my precious brother that's out there tell the whole truth I went to him privately and God is my witness and he'll SP you back I never read the book on the front of that book called plag rizing and I knew the Holy Ghost had show me it was a spirit on that book now when Josiah and them got something they took you straight to the priest is that right now so when you doing things the right way and when individuals I met with him three times privately y'all can challenge me and you go pull it up on the website I told him I said brother go pull up Jesus Christ Church of windsboro South Carolina now this is what the one that accuse I I didn't even look at it I believe he's a man of God I know he's a man of God God showed me he was a man of God when my pastor told me not to look at something I didn't look at it I could I didn't even know my name was out there so when we got there I said brother go you look at it I said everyone that spoke against this prophet I told him eyeball to eyeball sir sir when I met my pastor he tell you I said brother I like to talk to people face to face and when he got there I said brother you look on in and see what happened to him I said Jeff Williams Brian small you got hry Parks I said go in there and pull it up and you see what happened to the ones that smoke against this Prophet tell him didn't not I say that brother Tim and all the ones that's following him you know when you're accused and that's why I said one thing I wanted to say the last time when I was here I wanted to apologize brother John and different ones because maybe I come a little too little too strong I felt a little too strong when I said something about the uh songs and different songs was coming and and and God G me Grace to talk about that another time but when I went there and I told see even when I was in the world supervising people I one negative thing that my manager told him about me he said I was overprotective of the people that was underneath of me and I'd rather be overprotective than under prototec and when I met him I told him said brother you better be careful one of his dearest friends called me see this message is so true I knew I wasn't dealing with him I was dealing with the devil prophet of God said once they leave from this message a deceiving and a lying Spirit comes on them the Bible said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and power and wickedness and rulers in high places I told him that I said brother you need to be careful and when he called me in the time and I told him I said brother even the brother in 1950 I said I could bring you the paperwork what happened to him when he called that old Baldhead man I said if he's still alive he's probably about a hundred years old I said look and see what happened when it came against this prophet and when the first lion Spirit came to me and some of the brothers that's sitting there they came and asked me well what do you think do you think he still believed the message I said I went to him myself he told me at the time yes that's all I can do I to my son that come up in there I pers I took persecution from him I took persecution from all of them but I looked at him and said Son the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord I said you may be right with my some of my children they may do such and such they may do such and such when my wife and I was raising them and I looked at my children and I would tell them but it's my decision that I have to make for that consequence I went to him a second time I'm tell I'm telling you these things because some wonder why I was still there he told me he believed Malachi 4 brother John I believed him I went to him a second time he told me believe I believed him Holy Spirit already told me he was lying told me he was lying the first time but he did not tell me to leave yet and when I went to him the third time tell the truth brother Tim I met him in the waffle house and he gave me scriptures I had not even talked to brother C the same messages that he gave brother Steve the scriptures that he tried to convince me why he left this message he was already here ministering on it to y'all God has ordained this one of his best friends came to me called me said but Tim said you said so and so look got quiet I said he dead he says you said this about me I said aren't you and brother Tim friends he said yeah I said why would I want to break up your friendship I never even mentioned to him why would I do that see it wasn't going to gain me anything I said brother isn't it kind of strange that my name came up just out but this the second time isn't it strange my name just came up out of the blue out of nowhere you ever thought about that why I'm talking about a dear close friend to and they called me back the next day and they said brother Kelly I'm sorry I believe you I said that's okay be honest with you me I'm a Warrior when that Holy Ghost get on me you know what I really said I can't care less if you believe it or not God knew it God knew it was the truth that's all that mattered nobody even knew it if anyone in my anyone in my heart that I felt that it could have helped this brother was brother to at the time he's my pastor and I wasn't going to do anything anything wrong a against the word of God against the people of God so that's how now you know he had an opportunity and the reason why my wife and I still we didn't even know what in the world was going on and then we finally found out the truth come to find out a person has not failed until they start to blame somebody and T I found out and I told him but Tim I love you but I'mma do my homework just like you did your homework I found out the things that it was true I found out I went way back see I always wonder brother John I always wanted to be a detective you see so when we come there and I went way back and I found out he had struggled with this message 10 years before that and I don't want to go there and so some of you know what I'm talking about visitors forgive me the pastor will explain those things but I didn't even know what was sent out Pastor said don't look at it I wasn't going to look at it these things is in my heart I was never never going to throw any darts at other I was never going to sing because see when Jesus and I'm I'mma Sit Down When Jesus came to Judas and he knew he was going to betray him he said my friend do what you're going to do quickly God bless you thank you thank you [Applause] amen like Bram say you have any question you need to go back and refer to this in other word he was under the ministry of brother Brian small that's where brother Kelly was and brother Brian small left the message and as one of his sheep in the past he was longing for somebody that could help brother Brian small so he took the book of brother Brian small and never read it and took it to brother Tim like brother Tim you the only one that I believe you can help that brother that was how brother Kelly handled the book brother Kelly never read the book so what I'm going to tell you don't start war on Facebook sir we're not here to entertain the devil that's right this is probably the last time I'm going to talk about this I'm not playing ping pong on the pulpit amen amen amen I'm not here to play ping pong on the pulpit this one say something and I answer this one say something and I answer we are far gone amen forgetting the things that are behind and looking forward to those that are before amen amen so for this church remember Lord twice don't look back again to see where you come from don't look at the video again to see what's going on don't be a frog am a frog is an animal that move forward but he Keep Looking Backward amen forget what is behind we know what happened the Lord has been gracious to us the Lord taught you here several month but after teaching you must have a test amen that's why they send you a message right amen that was your test to see whether you are standing or not so congratulation you passed the [Applause] test let's stand amen congratulation for having an A+ it make me proud you're not standing because of me because of the word that was preached here so if somebody want to talk to you about it we don't hear those stuff we don't have time for that it's homegoing time we're going to heaven if you choose to leave the message that your that your prerogative continue respect us we believe the message and we're going to stand for the message you don't believe it that's fun continue on your road amen blessed be the name of the Lord Deuteronomy chapter 7 so I'm not going to give any more luxury of my time to talk about this anymore if you go listen to that that's your problem the Bible say fle the appearance of [Music] evil if you declare yourself you left the message I don't have one second to give it to you right amen let's be like Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic we see one another God bless you how are you doing that's it respect my faith I respect your faith and respect also the sovereignty of this church the people already left respect our sovereignty amen Deuteronomy 7: 6 don't wait for the end of the sermon to put a time down you better put it right now amen verse six if you dare you can say amen amen for you are a holy people Hallelujah to the Lord your God the Lord your God has chosen you to be a special people we talk about Esther on this Esther was chosen and it's a holy chosen I mean a holy chosing you are a holy people a special people to the Lord you are his bride amen he had chosen you to be a special people to himself above all the people that are upon the face of the Earth in other words there are many people in the face of the Earth many virgin you remember many queens many people but you have been selected as a special one verse seven the Lord did not set his love so the choice is not based on anything else but love you might be seated so the Cho of Israel is by God is a choice that was completely based on love amen he chose you because because you he love you there is nothing you didn't do while you were yet sinner Christ died for you amen the Lord did not set his love upon you nor chose you choose you because you were more in number than any people amen yeah not because of your beauty not because of this and this the Lord just chose you because he loves you period Amen in love we don't discuss love somebody might have what you think ugly face but the other person look at him like he's beautiful you can talk all you want he's going to tell you when I see her I can't sleep period the problem is you need to have a revelation of that person when you have a revelation of that person then you going to understand why they falling in love with the person amen the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people Esther was a stranger she was a Jews she was an orphan no father no mother raised by a a cousin and yet the Lord went all the way there and pick her up as the brde above even the Persian women everybody clear let's go to Esther chapter 5 I know my time is already taken a little bit but just bear with me amen we must support the week so please understand Esther chapter 5:4 if you dare you can say amen I will try my best to get into the banquet of Esther and Esther answered if it seems good to the king let the king and hon how can you invite him this is a woman going to her husband she want to have a time with her husband but in that private time in that date time bring amen inow a trial of jealousy wow you remember that sermon yes the trial of jealousy you don't play with somebody else wife Amen Let The King and hmon come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him who is him the king so the banquet was not prepared for hon it was unto the king but the only guest is hmon who is the TR verse 5 then the king said cause Amon to make haste so in other word Amon was not there I don't want to talk when Amon is not there I want to talk in front of Ammon I want a confrontation I don't want to backbite about him I want to talk to him to the face amen then the king say cause hmon to make haste that he may do as Esther has said so the king and hmon came to the banquet that Esther had prepared Esther prepared this banquet but Esther did not know whether she's going to have access to the king or not because the case was if the king doesn't stretch his golden scepter they're going to kill you so she was not even sure whether is going to work or not but instead of waiting that the king gave her [Music] access and give her permission to talk to him Esther already prepared the banquet which is an act of faith faith doesn't wait to see the result amen like somebody who was going to the prophet he had a problem with his feet the person purchased the shoes before he was heal so when he went to brother brandham he he already have his shoes on that as soon as he get here he put his shoes back on Amen that is Faith you're looking for a baby you don't wait until you pregnant you begin to prepare the room first for that baby before you see any symptom amen that's the faith of Abraham verse six and the King said to Esther at the banquet of what wine so these banquet are Banquets of wine and we know what wines mean so we are still in the church ages yes but it's another aspect of the church ages because we are still dealing with the wine remember the second Feast of King aerus there was it was a feast of wine but now the Bible is explaining you something about the bride age amen praise the name of the Lord this book is like a book that was loaded for the end time bride amen and the King said to Esther at the banquet of wine what is your petition and it shall be granted you and what is your request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed then answer Esther and say my petition and my request is if I have found favor in the sight of the king and if he please the king to Grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and hmon come to the banquet that I shall prepare for no more him them you need to read your Bible differently amen the banquet that I have prepared for them that's where the trouble is going to come and I will do tomorrow as the King has said the first banquet I'm drawing the attention of my husband I'm pulling him a little bit closer but the next one am is included amen verse 9 then went hmon forth that day joyful and with a glad heart so what I want you to keep in mind here during the whole banquet nobody could detect that Amon was a bad guy amen when they sit with Amon amen was a good man everything was good amen was happy amen was joyful and nobody was able to detect the spirit of amen amen in other words amen was undetectable during the banquet amen praise the name of the Lord now when Esther when Hammon leave the banquet he was still happy nobody saw him nobody expose him nobody unveil him nobody uncover him all his hidden plan are still hidden everything on the surface looks good he looks like he's a good man now look at who's going to unveil him are you there verse 9 and then went amen forth that day joyful and with a glad heart nobody sees me but when H and saw Mor amen if you want to detect hon you need to bring hon in the presence of Mori amen if he's just sitting in the church you will not know him bring him in the presence of Mori then you going to see where the Amman is still that happy joyful man or who is truly her it takes morei to unveil hon okay when hon saw morai in the king's what so if you are looking for the king gate and you don't know where the king gate is you have a sign amen check the gate where moreai is seated that is the King's gate and the gate is a door and Jesus say I am the door to the Sheepfold if you want to find the door to Heaven make sure the cross that you find have morei sitting there you must have the prophet inside the word you must go in the church where the Prophet is sitting that is the entrance to Heaven that is the entrance to the king gate you want to get into the palace if you don't see the prophet don't go there if you get to a church the prophet is not there get out that is not the king's gate King's gate always have the [Applause] prophet Hallelujah but when hmon saw Mori in the king's gate that he stood not up the faith of Mori is powerful amen no move for him he was full of what indignation indignation against who so the face of hon the Bible says that he was joyful he was happy but when you take hon and you put him in contact on the prayer line amen with more then the face of hon [Music] Chang amen the face of him and change from a happy face to a face that is angry but for you to have that change in the face you need the contact of morai if you don't have morai hon is still happy put morei there more will discern Amon amen nevertheless verse 10 H and refrain himself amen so he showed his color and when Mora cast him out he refrained himself amen and when he come home so he went back to his home he s and called for his friend and zish his wife let's go to the last one so we can pray Romans chapter 7 if you dare you can say Amen Romans chapter 7 verse 18 the bible say that for I know that in me this is Paul filled with the Holy Spirit and I know that in me that is in my flesh not in my soul because Paul is saved he already of the Holy Spirit but Paul is telling you that in my flesh I'm very specific dwell no good things for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I found not in other word there is a law that is fighting with me that law is no longer in the soul it is now in the flesh the soul is already redeemed but the flesh is not redeemed yet complete Redemption you will must have body change jum to verse 22 for I Delight in the law of God after the inward that's the soul amen but I see another law in my in my body it's a war amen Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of what which is in my so even though you are saved in your body you still wrestling with sin that's why we get sick that's why we get Temptation because the body is not redeemed yet everybody clear oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this but I thank God through who Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of what amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have done for us father without you we can do nothing Lord we are committing this service unto th hand may you come father speak to your children move me completely out of the way be the beginning and the end of this service Lord father remove every hindrance every demonic spirit away from this place but may nothing else but the Holy Spirit take the full preeminence as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you we are in King aaries three feast in Ester 2 banquet part seven somebody might be wondering why am I reading scripture scripture scripture scripture brother Bram say here he said knowing that you are my responsibility and on my hand for the gospel I shall always want to keep you right in the pages of this that's the reason why I give scripture the way I do give him the message is King is three feast and Esther's two banquet originally if you look in the Book of Esther there are seven Feast everybody following me the first Feast towards the Feast of King aerus which explain to you was the dispensation of the Old Testament the second Feast was the Feast of King aerus where he had a feast for seven days which were the seven Church ages the third Feast was still the Feast of King aerus but he was in the honor of Esther which will explain to you that he was the marriage supper but there is not a feast but it's hidden to understand that Feast you need a prophet we you know that in the Book of Esther Esther went and fasted for 3 Days everybody clear a fast in the body is a feast brother BR and I took this Bible and I just pull it open that like that and my thumb was laying at First Corinthian the fifth chapter the eth verse when something reads something like this when you come I was planning on taking a fast to the Lord I told him I would go out and fast said when you come to this Feast which a fast in the body is a feast with the and everybody clear so we know that so when you come to this Feast don't come with the old leav or the leav of malice and so forth but come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth just exactly what he told me in the vision God is my solemn judge come with the unle bread of sincerity and truth that is the so a fast in the body is a feast amen when you are fasting you are actually feasting with the Lord but you must do your fasting in the word amen praise the name of the Lord so the fourth Feast that was hidden was the Feast of the fasting of ES everybody clear the fifth Feast was the first banquet of Esther the sixth one is the second banquet of Esther and the last one is the Feast of purum Amen which we have not talked about it yet everybody clear so now last Sunday we saw that when Hammon went to the king he accused the Jews when he accused the Jews he was handed the Seal of the king and and we find out that the same seal that unveil Christ also unveil the ministry of the Antichrist now brother bam said that we need to go back to the power of God something that can do the same thing today because everything was quiet in the Kingdom everybody was quiet everything was going fine but the lord gave permission to Hon to bring pressure upon the people why does God allow pressure in our life why does God bring trouble in our life brother Bram says persecution always give strength to the church we have had it too easy we get it slowful we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything is just handed to us it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit so without trouble Esther will not fast it took trouble to bring prayer and fasting into the life of Esther everybody clear that Zeal and power that they had in those day has longterm vanished from our assemblies I'm afraid if the windows would be shut out tonight people will run everywhere and never even come back in other word if something happen just a little news about Corona virus nobody want to come to church people begin to forget about the power of God they begin to forget about the protection of God I am the god that heals you from all your diseases amen praise the name of the Lord so let's go to eser chapter 3 now as we moving slowly blessed be the name of the Lord Esther chapter 3 that's where we were and then we're going to blend in quickly Esther 3: 10 amen and then the king took his wing from his hand and gave it to hmon the son of hamadeta we saw it last week the agat the Jews enemy and the King said to himon the silver is given to you in other words don't want your money you can take it the people also take the people and do to them as it seems good to you just like God gave permission to the devil going to the house of job amen then where the king scrub call on the 13th day of the first month and there was written according to all that hon had what so when you look at this writing to the public it looks like it's the King who wrote the writing it looks like it is a declaration from the King because it is written in the Name of the King and it's also sealed with the Seal of the king so when it's read you will always see that oh my God the king is against us amen but actually the one who wrote that was hon but to the public it looks like it's the king am amen you might have a trou in your life and you think God is punishing you but it's not actually God punishing you it is the devil doing that amen jump to verse 13 and the letter was sent by post and into all the king's provinces to do what destroy to destroy praise the name of the Lord the first word is to destroy we are looking at the heart of Amon Amen to destroy K and to do what number two is to kill praise the name of the Lord everybody there and to kill and to cause to perish which is the same thing all Jews both who and who so the attack of hon doesn't have a n specification ammen attack everybody hon attacked the younger and the older one so nobody spared come on little what so that's why we need to bring the token in our home because the enemy is about the younger one he's against the other one he's against even little children little children and what sister you are not spare in one day even upon the 30 day of the 12 month which is the month Adam and to take the what of them for a so the enemy here is looking to destroy he want to kill and the third thing he want to steal the SPO for the people everybody clear so the heart of a man have a fulfillment of three things the first thing he want to destroy he want to kill and he want to steal everybody clear in the Book of John 10: 10 the Bible says that the fifth everybody clear cometh not but to do what number three checked everybody clear and to do what number two checked everybody clear and to do what number one checked yeah everybody clear and the thief cometh not B to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly amen now let's look at this fif clearly because now we understand that the heart of hon is nothing but the heart of the devil John 12:4 the Bible say then say one of his disciple who Jas is cariot which was the devil incarnated in flesh amen the son of predition Simon son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor this he said not that he care for the poor but because he was a that's why Judah was the devil incarnated everybody clear Judah was a thief and had the begag and bear what was put in them brother Bram continues as we moving in the exposition of the church ages brother Bram says remember while Jesus was upon the Earth so was Judah each came from a different spirit and upon death each went to his own place the spirit of Christ L and came back upon the true church on the day of Pentecost everybody clear and the spirit of who a fif Spirit came back upon the first so when Heaven poor hell also poor everybody clear it is right there in Revelation which is the seals every here brother Bram jum down see how that Judah Spirit came back as a rer on the what everybody clear everybody clear on a white horse he was white so close to the whe just as Judah was so close to who and as talking as the horse rider we know that we have three horse rider the first one was a white horse rider everybody should be familiar in this church the second one was a red horse rider which was the devil killing the people amen and the third one was the black horse rider which was the devil playing with the staff of life and selling them a measure of penny for B and two measure of wheight for a p you know that already he was destroying the staff of life amen but the was another hor which was a Pale Horse rid everybody clear brother Bram says that the Pale Horse is actually a mixture of all the three because to have the pale color you need to have the white color plus the red color plus the black color everybody clear but we know that Judah was a thief and a thief what he does he still and brother Bram said that Judah was the white hor Rider in other word the white rer was what stealing amen you have destroy kill and steal and you have destroy kill and steal amen so when Jesus was talking about the enemy comes to kill to destroy and and to and to and to steal Jesus was talking to you about the Pale Horse rid which his name was what that's the reason why the devil his name is what so when Jesus said the enemy comes to kill he comes to destroy he come to seal Jesus was putting the three seals together and telling you that the devil his name is death and his purpose is always to destroy to kill and to steal everybody clear and we find that in the Book of Esther here that the purpose of Amon was to destroy to kill and to steal in other word at this stage of Ammon Amon was riding the pale horse rider are we clear together are we clear together did we lose anyone praise the name of the Lord amen we're dealing with the pale hor R now let's go to Esther chapter 4 praise the name of the Lord [Music] to decode this you need a prophet amen now nobody knows this the announcement went to the entire Kingdom everybody saying the king is going to kill the Jews the king is going to kill the Jews the king is going to kill the Jews who's killing the Jews the king who's killing the Jews the king there was only one person that have the re of the P house everybody clear let's go to Esther chapter 4 verse one when who did what all that was what because the fourth still belong to Mori it takes the eager prophetic anointing to detect heron [Applause] amen when mon perceive all that was done M did what rent his clothes and put on S cloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cry with a loud voice of cry with a loud voice and a bit cry instead of Mora staying in his home and begin to M and weep they can't went publicly because a prophet is always a son to the public everybody clear and mon begin to cry you say brother was crying brother St in the message do what brother Bram said the word of the Lord is so great so good there just no way to stop reading it it just becomes Life as we read it like in this church I think in this text this morning though it's being taped I want to say this in the beginning I found if found I found who myself so brother Bram want to preach the message why cry and do what and brother Bram by meditating in the message he found out that that message was talking about his attitude [Music] himself amen and the reason that yesterday while in study and I come upon this subject why CHR I speak and then I thought I am just going if the Lord willing to speak upon that because he dve me what he be to condemn brother Bram himself because mon was crying and I hope he dve us all including brother Bram that we must see and cause us to look up and to study a little bit in comparing the day that was then unto the day that is what so it is a human tendency when Trouble Comes we have a tendency to weep we have a tendency to cry we have a tendency to complain we have a tendency to lament and brother Bram himself as human being found himself down that's the reason why when the news came mon himself was crying everybody clear let's jump down to verse two and came even before the what now he came before The King's gate with ashes upon him with with tone rment everybody clear came and he came even the before the king's gate for what none man enter into the king's gate clothed with what so the Bible here unfold something that when you approaching the king's gate you cannot wear a sack cloth to enter into the presence of the king come take Isaiah chapter 61 we're going to come back to Esther chapter 4 if you thereare you can say Amen we teach we bring it to your life we teach we bring it to your life we teach we bring it to your life everybody clear Isaiah 61:1 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings to the me he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God which is the second part amen not the first part now we in the second part and the day of venge we already explained this to God to comfort all that do what that's the second part which is the entire Ministry Amen to appoint to them there is a morning to appoint to them that do what that are crying lamenting because of trouble all that mourn to appoint them the moon in what Zion the bride to give to them Beauty for what because more they car put put ashes upon him but the enter

ministry of the end time have power in it to change your sadness into something when you go into trouble take one of the tap and push place and you going to see what's going to happen amen he said to give to them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mooning the Garment of what for the spirit of what the message come to give you a Garment of Praise a Garment of Praise but we found out that Modi was wearing a sackcloth but the message want to remove the sack cloth and to give you a Garment of Praise why do you need a Garment of Praise go to Psalm chapter one 100 amen when you go into trouble when you go into difficulty when something is not working when the devil is driving you crazy don't go before the king with a sackcloth don't approach God sad don't approach God mourning don't approach God crying there is a key to how to approach God Amen that's why mod was block to give you a message that you don't approach God like that how do I approach god brother Steven why is the message swapping my sack clo into a Garment of Praise why is the message removing my ashes and giving me Beauty why is the message removing the morning to give me the oil of Joy Psalm 100 everybody there verse one make a sad noise to the [Music] Lord make a joyfulness to the Lord all you L serve the Lord with what you can't come to church sad no matter what the devil did to you never come to church side are you there even if he hurt you go ahead and you start s smiling amen because your sadness will block you to the king entrance are you following me serve the Lord with what gladness come before his presence with what s that's why he's giving you a Garment of Praise if the S clo you cannot enter you must wear yourself with singing then you have a right to enter the king Palace everybody there Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord jump down to verse four we talking about the king's gate everybody okay enter into his gate with what everybody clear enter into his gate with what and into his court with with what be what and bless his what so when trouble comes in don't be sad don't be weary change the situation by Thanksgiving amen one day they took the Apostle Paul him and Salas and they beat them and took them and they put them in the prison and they put them in the shackle sister je the shackle were hurting the whooping were hurting but Paul and Silas look and they begin to sing Jes is

brother abble must be here that's why brother robbit must be here that's why we sing song before the sermon because the order of God in the church you start with the singer [Applause] amen he says verse 24 five the singer went before the player on what that's why we have instrument in the church follow among among them were the what so a sister Destiny you can play guitar in the church it is scriptural amen praise the name of the Lord and among them were demel playing with what why what is the key secret why Psalm 22:3 but Thou Are Holy oh that that inhabits what the Praises of who which

you go to the hospital if it's God accepted because it's God God want you to be sick but you going into the emergency room amen that's good am amen and every Province wherever the king's commandment and his decree decree came there was great mooning among the Jews and fasting and weeping and Welling and many lay in sacl and Ashes they can't get in the presence of the king so Esther's maid and her Chamberlain came and told it to Esther then was the king exceedingly grieved so when they told her they say we saw moreai over there his clothes are rent down he put ashes he used to come to church with suit he used to wear good suit and tie but for some reason we saw him he looks like he didn't shave he got his beard out he got his hair hanging down he got his pent down he's down he doesn't know he's under depression Jesus and say oh my god when people see Morey like this what are they going to say it's going to be a a shame and she sent a what a Remnant to cloth morai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he receive it so Esther the sin that more did to the public was a sin that was was uh was something that was embarrassing to Mori just like when David was dancing he embarrassed her wife I mean his wife and the same thing when Esther heard about morai in the public Modi going around the city Mori crying Esther was grieved and Esther took and then she said you know what let me get the Garment and go cover up remove this so people don't see you like that put this one amen Esther did not understand that Modi was a prophet a prophet sometime do things that seems bad in the public but he's doing that for a sign [Music] amen amen Isaiah prophesied three years naked how many people would have stand for the message of Isaiah amen when you go around they say your Prophet is naked over there do you see that logical how can you follow a man that is preaching naked it is in your Bible not one day 3 years would you have standed for Isaiah would you have stand with Isaiah preaching naked are you there would you have stand for Jesus make the [Applause] cross are you there if you didn't stand today it is the same attitude you would have over there amen the attitude you have for the message today is the same attitude you will have for Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever what are you going to do what are you going to do amen amen amen God T the prophet he said go get married amen the prophet got into the church yes sir the young sister say oh my God I'm going to marry a preacher yes sir yes sir they begin to fix their hair the prophet doesn't look there they begin to change their clothing the prophet don't pay attention the prophet goes and marry a prostitute [Applause] who would have stand for that Prophet [Music] today brother Steven he's a man of God look a man of God cannot do something like this a man of God cannot marry a prophecy a man of God cannot walk naked like this look this this is not good it's not good it's not logical a prophet must marry a virgin because he's a preacher he's breaking the word of God how do you know this is not good and then we begin to search for answers we begin to search for government to cover up our Prophet oh no maybe that humanly speaking you know it was just a human part [Music] amen the Bible say the New Jerusalem Square brother Bram say pyramid oh no maybe brother Bram you know he was making an error no amen John say I was looking up the pyramid down is a square [Applause] brother Bram was looking down John and brother Bram are the same how are you going to explain [Applause] it it is embarrassing get the Garment go give to more can let cover that up no no no brother we need to understand it is a human part and it is this this you don't understand the prophet he was preaching naked where is the human part where is the human Party 3 years naked where is the human party that's right oh no he was a neurotic Isaiah was not [Music] neurotic hallelujah hallelujah would you have stand for Isaiah yes would you have stand for Jesus Christ would you have stand for the prophet isah amen then Isaiah exceeding again he said a virgin shall conceive they say now you are crazy that's right brother let be logical a virgin conceiving where did you hear about it would you have standed for Isaiah Isaiah never took his word back it never even happened when he was [Music] alive amen would you have stand for Isaiah would you have St for Isaiah Isaiah is dead his prophecy didn't come to pass would you have stand for [Applause] Isaiah how do you understand Mori Esther missed Mori Mori was giving a son to the public es missed it she want to call upall you don't cover up the message where Abraham lied the Bible say Abraham lied don't defend Abraham leave it just like that amen more look he say I don't need the covering send it back to Esther Esther doesn't understand the message Esther does not understand my language Esther does not understand that I'm a prophet I am giving a sign to Israel how am I going to understand the prophet are you ready I am not even in 30% of the sermon are we there how do we understand the prophet let's go back to verse four and so Esther's made and her Chamberlain came and told it to her then was the queen exceedingly what because somebody show him brother Bram said here brother Bram said here brother Bram to why did he say something like this I believe he's a prophet amen am except you eat the Flesh and the blood of the son of man if you don't drink it you have no life he never explained that that's it you see he's telling people to drink his blood he's a vampire away with this message would you have stand for Jesus oh no no no no no you know he preached too long he was probably tired you know when you're tired sometime it's a human part that's why you say that he was not a human part you don't understand it put it on neutral leave it alone that's why he said repeat what the tap say repeat it just like that how do you understand the prophet how do you decode the prophet verse five amen verse five then call Esther who amen Esther call a man his name is hatack who's hatack if you want to know what the prophet is doing and said miss it she gave the clo B rejected it say how can I know what the meaning of what morai is doing is high teack yes Queen

constellation and those Angel were the spirit of the messenger that's right you ready praise the name of the Lord one of the king's Chamberlain it is not the Chamberlain of Esther it is the Chamberlain of the king amen come on who he had what to attend upon so eser here unfold something that the king had a special chambering called haac and he was appointed for es first went by human reasoning that probably modai is suffering let me send him something then morei rejected then he woke she woke up she said I have a tool to detect morai that tool was given me by the king that tool is called heart attack Hallelujah are you ready amen then call Esther for hatak one of the king's Chamberlain whom he had appointed to app to attend upon him and gave him a commandment to Mori watch now the first time Esther just took the the mentor garment send it go give it to him humanly speaking watch now how AR attack goes he sent him to know what he was I remember he's a prophet if he's doing

before the king's gate when they send the government Modi never explained anything never send a message back but when they send heack M have to answer are you ready verse S and M told him of all that had what he didn't say it the first time you want to understand the prophet you need hat attack amen and of the sum of the money that hmon had promised was morei there when hmon was talking to the King how did Modi [Music] know are you there hmon was talking with the King privately and he said I'm going to give the money the king say I don't need your money but mod knows even that conversation you see that the sum of the money that hmon had promised to pay to the king's treasure for the Jew to destroy what also he gave him what all this was already with Modi but when you approaching with human passion you're not going to get it that's right you need to approach Modi by hatack when you approach him by heart attack then he begin to explain to you the reason why I'm like this because something is going on because something is going on and begin to give him even scripture even copy even cat on who is heart attack I'm anxious brother Ste tell me are you ready the word hatack mean
