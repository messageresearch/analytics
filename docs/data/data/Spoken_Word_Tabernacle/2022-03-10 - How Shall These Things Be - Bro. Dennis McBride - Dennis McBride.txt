the lord a clap offering blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen amen how many are sighing and crying for the abomination in the city do you know that's the son of the holy ghost amen do you know that okay repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall be filled amen we need to get to the holiest amen you might be seated just a few minutes and we call the brothers who's going to minister tonight i believe the trust is asking me to remind you that this sunday there missed some kind of misunderstanding somewhere about our building fund will be for this sunday if i'm not mistaken so just remember this sunday lords willing will have the building fund amen and continue to pray for the saint in russia the situation might be lingering but if you look through a prophetic eye it is not what you see on tv did you hear that if you look through the eyes of prophecy and you look at what brother branham say and what is on tv it's totally east and west and probably you won't like it amen but it's just prophecy and it's keep vindicating that we got a true prophet of god amen everything is going straight to line and i can understand why the holy spirit is insisting on the holiest now so that everybody can self-examine their life and make sure you got the token to make it clear to go in the rapture you must have the holy ghost did you get it amen to make it to heaven down the road that's a different story but to go in the rapture and to escape whatever have started right now you must have the holy ghost amen so forget about your 20 years in the message you're 30 years in the message you're 40 years in a message forget about all of that amen examine yourself by the word we describe to you the other court we describe justification on sunday we explain it in much detail and the lord willing i'm gonna go through the scripture on sunday and show you every single step one two three one two three in the scripture one two three and it doesn't fail all of them one two three one two three one two three all of them you must repent and be baptized and receive the holy ghost all of them back to 38 amen so make sure you're checking your life pretty good if you think you gotta wait till i get to roof serving and it's gonna rock you more ten times more than what you have been wrong amen ahead oh my god amen if i'm preaching you three sermons behind something is wrong you are not in the holiest did you get me if they preach four sermons here and you are behind those sermons four of them on the road something is wrong with your work in this time amen i have a hard time sleeping last night because of what the boss was unfolding and you will see how lutheran are in this message and you're gonna see how westlay people are in this message and you will see pentecostal in this message amen the lord unfolded the roof under calvinism and i seen it going and i see the roof under armenianism right there going through that line and it's very very shocking and your marriages goes through the tabernacle and lord's willing you will see where your marriage is whether your marriage is in the other court or your marriage is in the holy place or your marriage is in the holiest place there is a way you behave in your marriage that is telling you your marriage is not where he's supposed to be and the problem is over the years this has been built so long until it's hard to break it do you know what i'm talking about you don't get me probably oh my what i'm trying to say is oh lord have mercy if you start your marriage in the other call the court sooner because you got quiet on me so i gotta say something amen if you started your marriage in the outer court and your children are not born yet it's a little bit different when your children are born and you have not moved from the other court do you hear me your children are watching you they are watching your marriage in the other court and if those children reach 15 years or 18 years before you realize that your marriage was in the other court and you start fixing your marriage after 18 years you have loaded your children with 18 years of other court in your life you are changing everything is good praise god but your children are going to suffer through their christianity because of what they have been watching at home for 15 years do you understand what i'm saying and now these 14 years here now it's the pastor suffering to fix this up amen and you hear me insisting for the newly married couple to make sure they can correct things quickly sometimes we don't get it sometimes they're the people that have a hard time being in churches amen sometimes they are the people that are behind because they do not understand that if your marriage was in a holy place for 20 years the children has been under trauma you won't understand what i'm saying if you live like a lutheran in this message or if you live like a wasteland in this message the children has been traumatized for so long they have seen so much at home that doesn't look like the message of brother branham until they're tired of the message and there is no desire for them to the message it takes amazing grace for god to drop through and then pick it up and show that child that you cannot be blaming your parent you need to take your own decision and move on amen and there and the and the and the pitiful way is we are struggling and i'm hitting a rock sometime trying to get the people to wake up and the parents are still playing games while the younger are picking up [Music] and what condoned their hearts what calmed their heart they've been in the message for 25 years they heard this one preach we preached the church ages with the church ages you look at the situation you are look at the situation your family is with all the knowledge that you have all these years may lord have mercy amen may god have mercy may the parent wake up i hate when they say you need to teach those kids where were you doing you need to teach the kids no i need to start from you before i can get to the family because you're the one that missed someone and the children are victims of going through a rough childhood because the parent was not in the holiest but they grew up in a message amen and they thought they have the holy ghost and they give everybody the holy ghost as long as they can quote the prophet they can discuss the prophet they can argue the prophet online on social media they thought they got the holy ghost and living like devils amen it's self-examining time what is going on in russia is not a game if i get in prophecy and pull what is going on in russia you'll be scared amen so examine yourself make sure if you're in the other court move down quickly move quickly amen if you brother branham say on sunday i read the quote that do not wait for the death bed because that opportunity might not be your opportunity to give your life to christ and straight to go to heaven amen but if you have been in the message 15 years 18 years and you never move from the other court something is wrong with your beginning you need to go back to the brazen altar again you gotta make contact with the living christ the living god and this message will not be a burden for you and when they say let's go to church you'll be ready to go to church don't worry my friend wait on sunday if you think this is good this is hard wait and the lord will help us amen so make sure you continue to consecrate yourself if you find yourself where you are get in your closet stop praying for god to move you up i'm not gonna do what they used to do what billy graham and the other one were doing bringing you here let's repeat lord jesus oh jesus i give my life i give my life for you for you from this day from this and you live and you're going to live like a devil for 20 years you go yourself in your closet open the closet shut yourself down you deal with god over there if you need help you call me we're going to bring the deacon here you're going to pray here until you hit that channel and you come out of this house here different amen blessed be the name of the lord thank god i'm not preaching brother mike brad is here preaching it has been a while since we seen him in a hotel but blackbird is a big friend of us and he's a family member and we appreciate all the family members here tonight we do not have visitors we got family members god richly bless you so let's stand as we call brother my pride only believe my friend only believe oh lee believe all things are possible [Music] only being [Music] ah [Music] amen jesus is here [Music] are possible jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus lord i believe [Music] do you amen tonight's saying say man lord i believe that all things are possible all things are possible [Music] lord i received i received lord i received all things [Music] amen let us just bow our hearts and our heads before the lord and as we're bowing let us realize that we're bowing before a living god and he's mindful of each one of us right now he understands all of our issues all of our problems and he's able to do something about it we just don't sing that song just to sing it it's more than just a good melody but it's a reality and god is making it more and more real to us he's taken us from a world of unbelief and he's brought us into his world he's drawn us closer to himself he's enabled us to be able to look at him now and hear his word and be able to agree with it and accept it heavenly father we don't want to prolong the time lord because we realize that speaking many words in prayer doesn't impress you but god you know our hearts you know all about us you know where we're at you know what we need forgive us lord of our sins and iniquities heavenly father lord we ask that you would please just have your way you know what we need lord more than ourselves sometimes we're too a little too confident fathering ourselves the natural types the spiritual lord many times as children are coming up in the world and they go through their different stages and enter into teenage and adulthood they account themselves to knowing more than what they should but lord you say that unless we come to you as a child meaning we don't come as though we know we come as though we don't nothing because even in what we think we know there is so much more to it there's so the depth there's more depths to it father it's more content so father from my heart you know that i don't feel like i know anything you've brought me to that place lord and i'm not the only one i know many of us if not all of us in here we've reached that place father by your grace so lord we pray that you would just help us now we've come from different places lord different activities different jobs things of that nature father god so we just pray that you will settle us in our spirits and help us tonight to speak and to hear let it all be you for your glory and for your honor we ask this father in your name the name of our lord and savior jesus christ let the church say amen praise the lord so the lord saw fit for us to be here tonight amen i i knew you didn't have a chance to know because brother stephen called me sunday evening right and so uh but nonetheless it's good to be here of course i don't know everybody by name but for those that i do know god bless you and for those that i don't know god bless you as well amen so let's get right into the word because i know it's a weekday and we have to go to work and things in the morning we don't want to make that a priority over god but at the same time just within myself you know i just want to be sensitive to that so let's go to luke chapter one god for a few of the saints that came up from columbia you know a little surprised there i didn't know they were going to actually make it but they're here by the grace of god amen we want to start at verse 5 it says there was in the days of herod the king of judah a certain priest notice he was a priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless it says and they had no child because that elizabeth was what she was barren and it says and they both were now well stricken in years and it came to pass that while he he executed the priest's office so that means he understood the scriptures right he was very familiar with a lot of scriptures god had led him to deal with i'm sure many things over the years so the part that we're going to emphasize here is is kind of a little surprising there but nonetheless let's move forward it says and and his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell on him it says but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard so it was something he was praying about how many have things that you're praying about praise the lord amen she says thy prayers were heard it says and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth it says for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor a strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready to make ready a people prepared for the lord and zechariah said unto the angel this is a very critical part and this is what we're going to be dealing with so he knew he was an angel and he just was told what it was that he prayed for right but notice how he responded here and zechariah said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years that doesn't sound that bad does it but the way that god heard it god was offended you see people can speak a lot of words right but there is a source behind those words there's a spirit that's behind those words so obviously in what zechariah said there was a doubting tone it was more of an unbelief that he was speaking from you understand what i'm saying now even though we're we're speaking about this in light of the scripture please understand that it's things that you and i deal with things that we pray for things you're praying for right now but see god he listens to more than just our words there's little spiritual tones and zechariah said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife will stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee to show thee these glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believers not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season so even though he had a little doubt in his heart concerning what was being spoken also understand his doubt didn't hinder the promise of god we're not always believing like we should isn't that right amen but how many know that our unbelief our little doubts and things it ain't going to hinder what god has promised for us according to his word because he said himself my word has gone out and it shall not come back to me boy he said but it shall accomplish what he sent it out to do and it shall prosper within the thing where until he sent it we say praise the lord [Music] let's bow once more heavenly father we thank you lord help us we pray in jesus christ's name we ask you amen praise the lord okay so before we really get into this let's go also to see this is luke chapter one still right and let's just drop down to verse 26. verse 26 says and this and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent for this was sent from god unto a city that same angel he just went to zacharias so now he's coming and he's doing another visit right and it says um named nazareth he says to aversion espoused to a man whose name was joseph and the house of david it says in the virgin's name was mary it says and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou art thou says that thou that are highly favored and the lord is with thee he says blessed are thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his at his saying and cast her mind notice how it says this and cast her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus he says he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end it says then said mary unto the angel notice this now she said the exact same thing but even though she said the same thing it was coming from a different place her her asking the question that she did it was more connected to just an overwhelming feeling she was overwhelmed right because here it is she's a virgin but she's being told she's going to have a child you know i said she didn't disbelieve what was said obviously because god is god right if she was disbelieving she would have been treated just like zechariah but she wasn't ordained to respond like that so even though she said the exact same words god heard what she said differently because notice what it goes on to say how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon me and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she she have also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her he says who who was called barren it says for with god nothing shall be what impossible do you believe that tonight [Music] so just considering again your prayers your situations the things you're dealing with right now [Music] is there anything too hard for god no not a thing isn't that right i'm preaching to myself amen because we get into those places saints we get into those places where our minds get bound up listen one thing the lord was helping me to see in my own heart he said satan always desired to make the problem a rather i'm sorry yeah he wants to make the problem look bigger than the promise you get so caught up into everything that you're going through isn't that right until you begin to look at the situation over and over and over again and you spend very little time looking at the promise [Music] when the victory is in the promise looking at the word focusing in on the word stand focus but satan wants us to focus in on our problems he wants us to focus in on everything that's not going that's not going right but notice this now in verse 38 and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord he says be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her so then then it comes down and elizabeth now she begins to rejoice and she gets caught up in the spirit of god and here in verse 45 it says and blessed is she that believe notice this now it says for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her of the lord so when we are able to believe god and i want to show you how much grace is tied into this because you can't even believe god on your own it's not about how hard you can focus in on the word and repeat the word over and over and over again no sir god has to come down and anoint our faith and when god anoints our faith then we're able to look and stay focused on that promise it becomes a reality [Music] watch this let me just now for my title before i get caught up too much here how shall these things be how shall these things be that's a question that's a question that circulates quite often especially when we look at ourselves just like brother stephen was saying prophecy is being fulfilled all over the place and we hear the manner of word that god is ministering to our hearts and the devil the devil has a desire there is a way that he wants you to view yourself now god wants us to see where we are right right but god also wants us to know that we can't help ourselves it don't matter how messed up you view yourself as being i mean it might be real i mean we are messed up right i'm a work in progress you understand i'm saying i ain't got everything all together like that amen but you know what god is saying okay but you can't look at everything that's not together that's not how change is gonna come how does change come saints when we have faith in a living god according to his word regardless of what we see the bible says we walk by faith and not by sight isn't that right but now we're saying amen to that but how many of us so often succumb i said i'm preaching to myself i don't know about you but i'm having the hardest battles that i've ever had in my entire life amen it's a real battle isn't that right from the time you wake up to the time you lay down it never stops it's the greatest battle that was ever fought it's in the mind satan always trying to find a way to get ahold of our mind listen now and lock it into a channel amen listen now that that god can't even move upon because it creates an atmosphere how we allow ourselves to think saints it creates an atmosphere right around us now my question is now let's be honest with ourselves what kind of an atmosphere do you believe you have based off of the circulating thoughts that you've allowed to prevail in your home i'm talking about right now everybody being honest with themselves you understand the but it's impossible to please god without what the bible said we come boldly before the throne of why because of the blood it's the way that god made for us he knew how messed up we would be he knew how many mistakes we would make he knew how much forgiveness we would need changed and he made the ultimate way that's not lacking nothing [Music] that's an all-sufficient glory that was shared isn't that right you know what we're already forgiven [Music] you forgetting for things you ain't even did yet is that just me or did he say did christ say out of his own lips he said it is finished [Music] this is the first time i've ever ministered on this when he asked me to come just some things that started coming to me and it's just settled on my heart but the way that we allow ourselves to think is very important we're human we all have our ups and downs it's a part of life but god is here to give us more ups and downs he's here to change the tide isn't that right he's here to give us more victory notice this now i'mma try to i'm gonna try to keep this real tight listen this message here is called mary's belief i've been in that message for a few days now all the way up here i got a suggestion also brother stephen you might be able to make to the governor or the mayor whoever and they can kind of broaden those streets y'all got the interstate about 20 lanes all right lord have mercy i'm glad i left home early had a total stand still i thought i was back in cincinnati i know i caught you all off guard with that i was like man praise the lord we're here all right so now this is called mary's beliefs the reason why i mention that is because i listen to that message on the way up here all right he says here he says in the preacher questioned the angel one thing that stood out to me about brother brown and when he was talking about zacharias he says also something that bothered god was the fact that zacharias had examples of people that were in the same situation as himself and with him being a priest he already knew what the scroll said abraham stricken in years wife wife wound dead you understand what i'm saying so when god heard zachariah's words he was like nah i know i know i know i know he ain't just say that did you just sign that you just say what i told you you ain't mean to say that you ain't in your right mind but you saw what god did god made him dumb so he couldn't listen so he couldn't so he couldn't taint the beliefs of anybody else with the unbelieving spirit that was upon him you understand you know god will do us the same way we get to talking too negative and things of that nature god will shut your mouth up because god don't want to hear that god needs faith god needs an atmosphere on faith god say you know what since you want to act since you want to be a little i'm just going to go ahead and just close your mouth all together for the full term of the of the of the making of the body of john inside of his mom's belly he wasn't going to be able to say one doubting word to nobody [Music] god was preserving the atmosphere he says and the preacher questioned the angel how can it be i'm old and my wife is old he had plenty of examples in the bible there had been hannah in the temple he says that that had samuel the prophet after he was old he says and there had been sarah who brought forth isaac after she was nearly 100 years old he says and here this little woman had a head listen concerning mary here this little woman had to believe something that had never happened a woman having a baby without knowing a man she said how shall these things be my lord he said the holy ghost shall overshadow you so as you look at yourself and your problems as we near the time of the rapture and we take that self-inventory you might ask yourself how shall these things be but i say to you what it says right here the power of the most high the holy ghost is going to overshadow you and bring me past what he said he was going to do in your life but he needs our faith he needs our belief just taking him at his word whatever listen that was a messenger that brought a message to mary and god sent a messenger to bring a message to us he shall have an invincible army isn't that right he shall have a church without sparta blemish a wrinkle she said i'll be a super church isn't that right she will be just like him do you believe that [Music] and here this little woman had to believe something that had never happened a woman having a baby without knowing a man she said how shall these things be my lord he said the holy ghost shall overshadow thee in the holy and and the holy thing that be that'll be born from you will be called the son of god he says watch her she didn't question that she said behold the handmaid of the lord being unto me according to thy word before she even saw anything you know how it is with us right we pray about something we're waiting on something right and as long as we can see things seemingly moving in our favor then we come to church shouting the praises of god oh praise god because the sense has done declared something that looked like god is moving through my senses i've been comforted so now i'm coming to church and i'm on fire because because my my eyes are whatever and declared that god is moving on my behalf i got a letter i got a phone call or whatever the case might be but what if you have nothing you understand we're talking about a different level of believing here well you ain't got no sign that nothing is happening at all can you still believe the word of god can you still give praise to god no matter what you see situations might even get worse can you still give praise to god just as much as you would if you received it brother branham said when you got that 25 cents you can rejoice like you got the bread even though you ain't got the bread yet and now 25 cents is all faith isn't that right but see now listen saying satan don't like this listen now i'm talking about right now god is here but satan is here angels are here but demons are here and they want to try to break the influence of the word and the power of god how through blocking our men our mentalities notice how the prophet says this same message he says if we could just do that talking about mary be it unto me according to thy word i ain't seen nothing yet i i don't feel nothing yet i don't even see how it's going to happen sometimes people's situation saying seems so far like it's so it's such a dire need you don't need to see how it's going to happen and the devil want to draw our attentions right there we'll come to church we'll hear a good word we'll rejoice god will lift our faith up and then when you go to sleep tonight or wake up tomorrow the satan satan is trying to pull your mind right back to that doubting spot to make you listen now to make you question just a little question listen watch how he says this watch how he says this it says that's what god loves watch he says that's the only way to get right with god is to take him at his word he says that's the only way that there is to that there is to please god is take his word he says don't trust your knowledge don't trust your knowledge he says amen he says your reason how can it be done [Music] see that that's the kind of questioning satan wants to bring how how shall these things be yeah you you know his favorite tactic is to make us feel like that word it was for everybody else and somehow you this little special case that it don't apply to how many know he's a liar but the key to that is being able to recognize his voice and not just say oh that was just me thinking no no no no no no no the devil speaks to us in many ways and times and we don't even realize it he wants us to think it's just us because when you think it's just you now you just think it's all wrapped up into the person that you are and it's not it's something satan is trying to project to your mind to make you receive it as though it's yourself when it's not yourself it's him satan come to people and say now you know you want to kill yourself you ain't got no nothing worth living for everything is going wrong you know you'll be better off dead nobody really don't love you you know and things like that and so you know just go ahead and do them a favor too and just go ahead and take your life and just be done with all these issues and problems in the grace of god it's a sermon brother stephen i ain't preached yet i've been holding it for about i guess about six seven months the god who cares here it is the prophet sitting down in a service and all these people and i don't know how many people much more than what's in here it was an auditorium i believe here it is that little man down there but he's in tune with god and there's a son that needs help hey man brother brandon don't know the man he's a finite man brother brown is he don't know nothing but he's down there and all of a sudden he calls out he says soldier boy you're not going to commit suicide [Music] you're talking about oh the god who cares that man was contemplating taking his own life and god knew all about it and he took the time to pause and speak a specific word to that man that delivered him and saved his life but that's how the devil operates he want to push us to those places where we feel like hey i can't take no more i've reached my limits but how many know that's a lie as i was talking to a few of my friends the bible said that god won't put no more on you how many believe that so whenever you feel like you can't take no more you're about to break and then you don't reach your limits or whatever the case might be just you just just i pray i pray god help you at that time to realize you know what that's not what the word says [Music] if i'm in this place that means god want to do something watch these things he says don't trust your knowledge your reason how can it be done he says it cannot be done that's the reasoning see he says when you reason listen when you reason or when you allow the devil to cause you to question whether a promise can be brought to pass in your life or not brother branham says here when you reason then you lose the victory just at allowing yourself to question [Music] because when you allow yourself to question right that's what reasonings reasoning brings in questioning and then questioning breeds doubt can we say praise the lord sayings yes sir thank you brother i've been watching a few of y'all services there you know y'all been eating real good here hey man i say that because i see brother stephen he'd be up here with all them town he says everybody clear it's good i want everybody to be clear though brother i thank god for you man amen so i ain't gonna try to be like brother stephen i'll just be brother mcbride praise the lord all right so now let's you know we we've looked at that side of it reasoning will cause you to lose the victory so even though that seems to be a common i know it's a common kind of way about us when we allow just little questions to come up but the bible says we got to bring every thought into captivity and we got to cast down right because that's how the enemy tries to infiltrate our minds because once he can control of our minds then he can control us to a certain degree so now let's kind of switch it over a little bit now brother branham says here in a message called jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he says in the garden of eden satan chose his part of the man his head his intellectuals he says god took his heart the intellectuals will reason in your mind he says i'm this way and i'm that way you will never get anywhere with god he says there he says but your heart he says your faith will make you believe things that your mind knows nothing about amen he says you cast down reasonings he says see you must be positive and stay there until you are positive then when you are positive there's nothing can turn you you see so it's a battle it's not a cakewalk it's something that you and i have to continuously fight for didn't he say you gotta fight for every inch of ground that you possess that's deadly that's constantly it don't let up do it brother it don't let up like i said it's going on even right now some people are struggling in their minds you hear the word of god and you feel the pull but satan don't want you to get the victory [Music] and in that service when brother branham was there see now he began to see spirits and we saw a person beginning to believe he said he would see the spirit upon that person call out to another spirit to come over and help it now it's not a strange scene so what was taking place at that moment it was false thoughts in a person's mind and that spirit was calling another spirit to try to bring in more thoughts to bombard the person's mind to make them buckle to make them lose sight of the word they've been actually hearing and now to begin focus more on a problem than the promise well the banner says i'm not worthy to stand up here but he called me to do it that's exactly how brother mcbride feel amen i'm not worthy to stand up here but he called me to do it you're not worthy to be a christian he says but god made you one he says this temple is not worthy to stand on this ground but god said it here he says that's it he says it ain't it ain't what you are is what he is everybody's always looking at their self amen he says why you say why you can't look at yourself and get anywhere he says you are finished to begin with you are a failure to start with there's nothing to you to begin with it's what god made you he says it's what you are he says god don't even see you he sees your sacrifice isn't that right can we say praise the lord say this oh lord all right so now there's a promise right and for whatever we're going through there's a word that pertains to us it just takes the leading of god to help us to see it to come across it the thumb through those pages and your eyes and your heart land upon a place and the next thing you know you feel that once you begin to read it you begin it's almost like your soul is drinking that a cold drink of water in a dry land it just feels so refreshing because it's a word in due season isn't that right [Music] you remember we said that you can't even you can't even believe on your own brother i know you're hearing a good word i know you go home and you try to give time to the word and things of that nature amen and we've been in those places we know that we've spent time in the word and whatever but we still find ourselves doubting we still find ourselves struggling at times losing sight of the promise and focusing in on the problem unless god keep us saints we can't be kept we're not strong enough we're not wise enough we don't have enough knowledge we can't do it unless god do it it won't be done but notice what the prophet says here it says when god oh lord when i read this everybody listening everybody listening real good i'm saying that because this is a nugget now i'm about to pass something real valuable on to you it's a nugget now i'ma tell you exactly where it's at and everything you can go back and get it print it out do whatever you got to do you can polish it up and go back and look at it again this is from the message called mary's belief 1959 april the 9th it says when god put something upon a person's heart many times you find yourselves with certain things on your heart a desire to receive something to receive the holy ghost to receive more of the holy ghost to receive healing to receive something or another and you feel that thing in your heart and you begin to kind of speak about it a little bit many times we don't realize what that is we're not able to capture the moment per se to really know that that's god that's god actually putting that thing on your heart like that watch this now he says when god puts something upon a person's heart he's ready to do something i don't want to gloss over that when god puts up what do you have on your heart right now that pertains to the things of god what's been impressed upon your heart the cause you to seek after whatever the promises might be that's just in your heart like that what's doing that what brought that to you [Music] is that just you is that because i i heard the word brother they put it on my mind no what's impressing that on your heart like that it's god but if it's being impressed on your heart that means god is standing right there ready to do it you want the bible for that you want the scripture for that huh here's the scripture now write the scripture down philippians chapter 2 and verse 13. it says for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do with his good pleasure so that will that you have that desire that you have to receive a certain thing from god god put that desire there and the reason why you put it there because he's ready to perform it in your life don't let the devil take that away from you [Music] can we say praise the lord i'm gonna leave you with this the message again marries on various beliefs same year 59 april the 9th this is paragraph 9 he says and you know it's usually when you're thinking about god and keeping our minds on god that god comes close to us he says i think that's one of the great troubles of the people of this day we have too many other things on our mind even when we come to the to a healing service we seem to think well did i get a prayer card or a prayer card tonight see that's that's the reasoning of the devil how many times we've listened to a prayer service and the lord completely leaves the prayer line and moves out into the congregation to somebody didn't even have a prayer call why because they will believe in god their faith pulled the pillow fire to their situation now how many realize you have that same capability you can pull the pillar of fire directly to your situation [Music] i think that's the one great trouble he said to the people of this day we have too many other things on our mind even when we come to a healing service we seem to think well i did not get a prayer card tonight or perhaps i'll not be prayed for he says we will never be able to accomplish much as long as we keep those kind of thoughts whether you get a prayer call tonight whether you get prayed for or not amen the woman with the blood issue it didn't matter she was locked in and brother branham said she had to believe for something she didn't have a scripture to be able to go back to but see that's what an anointed faith will do praise the lord is everybody clear amen keep me in prayer saints i need your prayer i solicit your prayers i'm done i feel led to stop but i believe you understand simple message like i said it's ministering to me amen simple faith in god's word amen you gotta fight for it the devil is gonna fight us so we gotta fight back isn't that right we gotta fight to keep our focus because god is ready to manifest the promise let us all stand together and let's give the lord a handclap for praise praise the lord i'm not going to call a prayer line because whether you come into a prayer line or not you still got to believe so in light of what was just emphasized to our hearts let us just bow heavenly father lord we're grateful we're grateful for your mercy and your grace that show that that you constantly pull out upon our lives so undeservingly lord we're not deserving of anything that comes from you father but at the same time lord you see fit to give us everything that you've given us because your view of us is much higher than our view of ourselves and as your prophet taught us in perfect strength and perfect weaknesses lord we don't want to make our weaknesses excuses he says because that can hinder us also it's good for us to know that we're nothing but yet we want to be able to still allow you to help us to see who you made us to be it's not who we are within ourselves but it's what you've called us to be as what we are to you and we are your chosen we are your bride we are your elect god it's many times difficult to see things in the right light especially when you're in the midst of opposition oftentimes lord we we find ourselves failing you and being able to hold to a positive mindset but we want to say thank you for the way that you've made for us and how you work with us lord and your longsuffering toward us father and you pick us up lord you give us further instruction you comfort our hearts father lord it's just a blessing to be a part of your family and a part of your economy well we pray for every soul that's here i know there are issues that are presently here lord amongst us father physical issues lord mental issues spiritual issues lord there's all sorts of things father god but you are still the great physician and you're here right now father and even the word that you've allowed us to hear tonight it was sent forth to heal and to deliver lord god lord help me to receive the very word that was spoken out on my lips help me to believe you lord even as the the young man's father said unto you he says lord i believe but help my unbelief granted father god we love you help us to love you more bless this church continuously we pray father you've been doing so much all over the world amongst your bride lord and we say thank you for that thank you for every little thing lord thank you for every big thing father we thank you for all things lord we ask all these things in your name the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen god bless you amen what a powerful and wonderful message tonight how many enjoy it hallelujah have you heard about your brazen altar have you seen it have nothing to do just accept the cross and everything will be all right somebody asked me say pastor how can i move from the other court to the inner court it's unbelievable say pastor i need a meeting with you i say yes sit down say what's the problem say i don't have any problem the problem is about the preaching say i see where i am how can i get to the holiest what a desire what a desire and i gave that person this answer i say brother branham say and down the road you will see it because you got to see where you are first and you see your situation then the lord opened up the door brother branham said that the same holy spirit that caught you and justify you are you okay he is the one that's going to sanctify and he is the one that's going to bring you all the way to the baptism of the holy spirit i say sister the deacon was there i said there's only one thing you have to do just obey that's why you heard brother branham saying that obedience entitle you to the token in other words when god says something to you just receive it like mary and move on receive it like mary and as you are receiving it and doing what god says to do automatically you are moving without understanding until one of this day you're gonna look back and you say wait a minute i thought i was struggling something last year but i don't know what happened the lord will allow a test to come and you will see like you overcome the test and you say wait a minute is this me or not usually when this kind of stuff happened to me i react a certain way you already been dead that's why the devil is fighting with a stubborn spirit when the word come you rejected hallelujah very simple my brother i'm gonna read the quote hallelujah it's unbelievable amen brother branham i have a quote i was reading and brother branham say the baptism of the holy spirit i'm paraphrasing is based on predestination in other words somehow you gonna be pushed into the holiest whether you like it or not if god have to whoop you he's going to whoop you until you get there so you be you better come the easiest way quickly brother branham says this hallelujah he says that is what power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law and our law is not keeping a bunch of commandments it's a law of faith it started at the brazen altar right there the fundamental foundation right there hey buddy he says and if you can jesus say all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever god will lead your soul to believe that is yours that heart the brother was talking about is your soul when the lord impresses something on your soul automatically he's there to perform let me ask you a question who do you believe based not what based on what i say not me based on your experience since we got in this church let me start it again based on your experience your own history since we started from the hotel up to now who do you think is leading this church not because of me i want i want to hear from you who's doing it the lord jesus christ it's the holy ghost doing it okay so if the holy ghost is bringing a sermon and putting that in me to deliver it do you hear me and that sermon is telling you check where you are you need to be going to the holiest what do you think god is telling you [Music] did you get it did you get it in other words god has opened a door the message is anybody that has been struggling go ahead quickly and enter that's why he is opening the word so you can see him clearly and say okay i am justified i need help then he say come on quickly i already opened the door that is the language anything the lord bring in your heart anything the lord is bringing on this pulpit belongs to you how can god talk to you about getting in the holy ghost without him opening the door for you to get in a hole yes some are getting stuck into something no all he's trying to tell you is look what you have been doing look at your marriage do you see that okay look where i want you to go you don't have nothing to do just approach and go ahead i just open the door move quickly because the gentile door is about to be closed go ahead quickly and get into a rest when you get in the rest in the holiest then your hands are off your life and the holy spirit is leading you amen you do something wrong he comes not you he comes he say you remember what you did there go ahead and fix it you fix it and you feel the joy you say it's me go ahead and keep moving this way keep moving this and before you know it a thought is in your heart a strong painful but i'm saying thirsty is a painful desire it's like you can't help it when you tell somebody people look at you like you're crazy why are you believing that nobody else is believing it if i tell you things i believe some of you will have your head spin i told somebody i said do you believe about paying your house off before i was a pastor because somebody would say he got in the taff i start believing that before i was a pastor when i was a deacon because i read certain things in the scripture that god told me that i'm going to give you a house you didn't built you want to see those scriptures me a text i send it to you and the lord said that he will live and give you a house that is furnished but you didn't do anything to that amen you see the level we need to go with god not only if he can do that for the material thing how much more the spiritual thing how much more amen we cannot live in this world like we barely made it we have been programmed to overcome we have been predestinated to overcome whether you like it or not like the brother preached tonight god the words will come to pass amen take that simple faith take him at his word he spoke tonight you have problem maybe something is going on home maybe somebody have sickness maybe somebody who's streaming has been battling in the body it is time for you we heard this many times take god at his word ted god it is where god came back again tonight to tell you take me again and my word don't look at the circumstances and remember the devil is going to make it harder amen but do not focus on that because every time you focus on that you just about to lose what i'm about to give you amen brother branham say if the lord if it's not that they say bodybuilder what about you don't find it there brother branham say if it's not that god will put one day hallelujah my god my god brother my god god richly bless you this is powerful amen amen just remember simple faith god will move you all the way if god i told a young man i say if you really mean it from your heart and god look at your heart and say this boy is decided god will give you the holy ghost god will give you the it's not complicated god will give you the holy ghost all he wants you to do is just get tired of yourself look at the brazen altar die at the base altar take the sacrifice that was given at the brazen altar which is your cross remember you nothing and then move on with that simple faith and god even the virtues of the stature of perfect man brother branham say you don't put that on your own they are automatically birthed they continue the more you lay in the presence of the sun the more these things are going on amen you encourage now take the sword and go back again and suppressing on the fire amen blessed be the name of the lord the brother kept this message to be delivered in this church short sweet simple and right on target let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again once again for this wonderful gift that you have sent tonight lord father opening the door for your servant to come and deliver such a powerful message in the midst of what we're going lord father you saw exactly that the thirst in this church is rising up higher based on what has been ministered about the holy spirit and the people now are thinking how can i get this holy ghost he's talking about how can i get into the holiest and you sent somebody to bring a simple key to remind your children that you the one who made the promise you say that promise was unto you unto your children and as many as the lord your god will call and father you called us in this message you know exactly why we were here lord we could have been laying in denomination father but you so fit to bring us in this entire message lord i pray in the name of jesus christ that whatever the need is whether it be physical or spiritual whether is somebody somewhere struggling in their business or whoever is having a trouble father may they take you at your word and may they stay ready and may your blood be a bumper between them and the devil so that lord father you can fulfill your word in our life because that's the that's the longing of our heart lord father remember brother mcbride for the service lord father you have done for your children father may you strengthen his body lord he have to drive again back probably more than two hours and the saints that came lord father may you give them travel mercy lord may you open up the way so that there won't be any traffic father may you move away every spirit of accident or anything that can cause a trouble but bring him safely to his respective place and bring each one of us here lord father that have gathered tonight lord safe in our respective place and if you tarry to come father may you consecrate us more for your service so that we can come on sunday morning lord having more testimonies for what you have done for us lord we thank you and commit everything unto the hand in the precious name of jesus christ amen brother will go ahead and lead us with a song thank you jesus yet the deacon want to remind me that we don't have to pick up the building fund this coming sunday it was taken last sunday so just remember not this sunday it's going to be two weeks down the road thank you very
