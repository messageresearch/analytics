him was at the old church and he was in bad shape i'll just put it that way and does he you want to give it well you give it you start then he might take a little bit but uh wednesday night we were here we listened to brother polly carp and the message that he brought i went home and i listened to the message that brother donnie reagan was preaching simultaneously the time that brother polycarp was preaching it's almost identical the message was almost god is with us saints god knows where we're at he knows where we're living and when he said wake up if you're slumbering it's time to wake up hallelujah good morning ladies and gentlemen um my testimony can get kind of lengthy but i'm going to give you kind of the nuts and bolts of it um i was at a very very bad place in my life this was about a year and a half ago i was living in gaffney i was living in the streets i was living in a tent in a walmart parking lot in gaffney if you guys know the boulevard down there um my journey that got me there was all out of pride as we all know which is probably the number one sin in the bible ask the devil um and it resulted in a secondary conflict in my life which was alcohol both of those together tormented my life for multiple years which resulted in my affliction carrying me to the gaffin area i'm originally from orlando florida but just long story short i was at the end of my rope i was teeter knocking on death's door so to speak um i had had numerous encounters with seizures related to alcohol getting on and off of it in and out of the hospital and i used to visit the walmart frequent not the walmart but the mcdonald's up there and that's how i got my free tv i would get my news my sports whatever since i was living in a tent but the odds of this gentleman coming into my life we're slim to none and he saw me in my most devastating state in walmart the actions that i had and just through his observances of me saw that there was hope and almost as if jesus was walking the way that he did seeing individuals in this world and seeing the best of them instead of the worse i'm a very judgmental person myself i do it on a daily basis and i frown upon myself for that seeing always the worst in a person instead of their best and this gentleman saw the best in me in my worst state ever which was amazing and he had the ability i at that point in my life was shielded off they always say coach yourself with the armor of god i had the armor of satan on and i was blocking the holy spirit from getting into my life at that point in time and talking to me blasphemy of the holy spirit that's unforgivable and i was doing that at the time so if i was going to call if that was my last purpose on this earth i would not be in a better place but thankful to my lord and savior and this gentleman right here which he used as an earthly tool to grab me by the hand pull me up by the coach strings and have all the patience and perseverance to guide me in the right direction i am in such a better place right now and i know it all it's all for my lord and savior but this gentleman was an excellent tool and i refer to him not as my mentor but as my earthly angel and i praise this man i don't give him enough praise but this is my next step in my life to continue the communication with this gentleman and without him i wouldn't be right here to be able to give my testimony with you guys so thank all of you guys for your prayers and everything thank you so much god is good all the time hallelujah glory now was that goosebumps i was seeing on your arms there brother i could tell you it was all over him amen i'm gonna move to prayer requests if that's okay my wife is traveling to panama on tuesday she's gonna be gone for three weeks and uh we'd like prayers you know for safe trip the pilots the people in the airports and to and from everything in the whole trip they're uh they're under a little more um restriction there with the covid um constant mass curfews at eight o'clock anywhere in the country so that she does he's not gonna be out after that anyway he's gonna be in a sister or a father's home but just pray for you know keep her in your prayers she's um her dad's very old he's in his early 90s and uh so you know her mom's in her 80s so it may be the last time who knows when she's hoping to do some witnessing while she's down there there's a she's going to meet a lady down there that she has been witnessing to and the lady now listens to brother branham's messages constantly she's over i think she's living in colorado right now somewhere over there she was in arizona or new mexico but they grew up in towns close to each other so they're going to get together and try to go around especially in the other girls town and and do some witnessing so you know just keep her in prayer does anybody else have a prayer with a prayer request this morning yes ma'am wow yeah we we were on the way home last sunday and uh came upon a as a it was a bad accident we had um we got there before the responding and it was uh it was a couple that had been hit by some kind of it was like one of these mobile campers well the car had rolled and we were we didn't know any better we just wanted to get them out you know we couldn't we couldn't both of the adults in the front seat were in the driver's seat they were they were heavy people and they were both sitting there i thought the man was dead because he was unresponsive but and the woman was not but it turned out that she's the one that had passed and there was a baby in the back seat and we tried we got it out but we probably did it the wrong way and uh you know we just edie was in the car crying and praying the whole time you know for mercy and it was very it was very i probably had to do something with the rain we were experiencing last week because you know the hydroplaning on everything but um so i don't know the names of the family my daughter did a little more research on it and talked to some of the responding people and found out exactly who had passed and um as far as i know the husband and the baby are still in the hospital they were in pretty bad shape he was he was you know from what i could see uh going in through the back window and then kind of looking in through the side windows and it was uh it was not good so so let's just remember remember that family amen all right praise the lord well greg you mind coming up and praying over these prayer requests this morning and um we'll cut we'll we'll um get a special brother robert's got a special this morning i have a couple of announcements as well i'll announce those before you come up and then we will get the pastor up and hear some word of god this morning sir it's just about our hearts father as we come before you lord here we are another sunday lord but lord let it just not be just another service lord we have gathered here for one purpose and that's to hear your word father may you break the bread of life to us father pour out your spirit here lord father is we were working there at the new church yesterday and talking with brother robert lord lord we're under great expectation father of what you're going to do and not what you are going to do but father what you are doing and father we look back and we see how far you have brought us in the last year and a half and father we just thank you for it father and lord this family lord that was in the accident last week and the little one and the father still in the hospital father and losing the wife lord and now this little one is going to have to grow up without a mother and lord we know that we're in satan's eden father and lord this it's just a terrible time a terrible time that we live in darkness has taken over the world father darkness has taken over the people father as you said in your word gross darkness has covered the earth and the people father but lord there's a light within us father and lord as as brother rick fathers and brother sam and there was a light that was shining forth from brother sam and and brother rick picked it up lord there was something there father lord may we all be that way may that that light of your word father shine forth from within us father and may it get go to these ones father that are here in darkness and may your light shine forth father we just commit this service into your hands father speak to us lord along the way may our hearts burn within us father as you speak to us along the way and now lord we just ask you to bless the tithes the offerings father lord may you multiply abundantly and father just speak to us father we commit the service into your hands be with us lord as we worship you and father may you receive the glory the praise the honor for it all in jesus name we pray amen y'all might be seated amen all right so be taking up a building fund at the end of the service today and did you want me to have the graduates stand this morning or how did you want me to identify them brother kelly where are you at just want me to have them stand or did you want to say something to them can we have the graduates this year stand go ahead brothers amen now it's been a long time since i've been in school but i'd say that would be a quite an accomplishment considering the last year you know with covet and everything i hope y'all learned something that last year okay if he was at the house but that's good that's great seize the opportunity but put god first right amen i got one more announcement and then brother robert will come up uh the wedding rehearsal at the union road church of god will be saturday night friday saturday or excuse me saturday excuse me i'm seeing seven o'clock and i'm saying saturday seven o'clock friday the 18th all who will have part in the event are asked to be there amen praise the lord brother robert amen how i enjoy hearing you sing amen god bless everyone thank god for the opportunity and the privilege to be here today and this song came in my heart last week and came back again this morning as um my wife and i were talking about something and she was talking about you know faith people saying well i have faith that you know god will work but we were seeing that if we're not in order god will not work because he wants preeminence and you could have a a bunch of perfectly formed body parts if they're not all connected the spirit can't do anything so this is what the song is about pray it blesses your heart i'm very nervous but i pray the lord will help us amen i think it it also came from something brother stephen had said about what the lord is doing among us that the word seems to be so you know shaking everybody and people thinking well the word is against me not against you is shaking you to put you in a place where you need to be and as long as we can catch that catch that thought then we could agree with the word and get in place quickly because he wants preeminence in the body amen it's it's based on hagia chapter 2 and verse 6. and the key the key is e if you have that please for thus said the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory sear the lord of hosts yet once more lord shake not just heaven but earth and many stars of being moved out of place but there are some who stood platies and orion in every age who kept their first estate [Music] and though the powers of heaven are shaken we've received the kingdom that cannot be moved all that can be shaken will be shaken [Music] let thy word lord shake us into place [Music] the heavens declare the glory of god and day on today utter at speech a night on tonight it showed knowledge for the in god's perfect peace but tell me what will happen if the moon should leave her place then the face of the earth would be a dark and chaos again so what about the earthly hosts who were made in the image of god if we are not in order how can we do the work of god yet once more lord shake not just heaven but earth and many stars are being moved out of place but we are those who stayed with pleiades and orion [Music] in every age we've kept our first estate the world is again falling apart and soon the millennium will be our shirt in but first this kingdom will be in you spiritually before it comes in the earth literally for in the days of the came tantos rock cut without hands to smite every image in our earth made by man and knowing not the kingdom of the lord is in you for the stone did not only smite but grew into a mountain too [Music] yet once more lord shake not just heaven but earth and many stars are being moved out of place but we are those who stayed the orion in every age we've kept our first estate and though the powers of heaven are shaken we've received the kingdom that cannot be moved or that can be shaken will be shaken [Music] let thy word lord shake us into place we were like dry bones down in the valley then the son of man came with a prophecy out of his mouth came seven thundering voices to quicken and bring to life this scattered body then came a noise and the shaking as each bone came to its bone sinew and flesh skin came upon it but it had no life of its own but then he prophesied again the dynamics came into that body and so today we can stand on the earth a mighty marching army so yet once more lord o sheikh not just heaven but earth and many stars are being moved out of place but we are those who stayed the pleiades and orion in this last age we've kept our first estate [Music] and though the powers of heaven are shaken we've received a kingdom that cannot be moved all that can be shaken will be shaken but let thy word lord shake us into place let thy word lord shake us into place o lord let thy word lord shake us into place hallelujah amen let's stand this morning we'll sing only believe [Music] all things are possible all things are [Music] possible lord but i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe amen lord and i believe all things are possible lord i believe jesus is here jesus is hallelujah jesus is here all things are possible jesus is in [Music] jesus is he demon jesus is in all things are possible do you believe it this morning let's give him a clap off in there amen blessed be the name of the lord we greet you all in the name of jesus christ and we appreciate all the family members okay we don't have visitors here we got family members amen so welcome into the house of the lord hallelujah the devil is wasting his time and probably he's upset because i'm going to read as they are 14. amen remember the building fund at the end of the service i believe brother john already mentioned that and lord's willing this coming sunday we will have brother chad lamb he will be preaching for us in the morning amen [Laughter] i see a lot of surprises remember we have the wedding anniversary on saturday everybody in this church is invited amen so don't say you didn't get the invitation because your phone is not hooked up or something so you're part of this church automatically you have a spot amen and anybody who feels like they want to help or they want to be a help you can stay after service and you would talk with brother robert and my wife and sister l'oreal i tried to get my head off of it because i got my head in the word amen so you want to help you feel like you want to do something just stay here and brother robert will handle everything with my wife and sister else mr pam and everybody else you will go ahead and talk about the wedding amen so everybody is invited but the child will be doing the ceremony we will go to the church and the the reception in the church is in the same spot so at four o'clock in the church but the child will do it then we move into the reception and then after that on sunday morning lord's willing brother child will be the one ministering amen if you don't know brother chad yet you wait till sunday amen [Laughter] you wait till sunday then you will know exactly yeah you will figure it out by the time he start moving up you will probably see your pastor behind there somewhere that's a great deep teacher amen so just be prepared he's going to be there he's coming with his entire family so we will have some wonderful and good time amen i tried to be in and out but i keep getting pulled into the wedding stuff we had to find the goat brother kalima amen [Laughter] that was my first time in the slaughterhouse and i was standing there and i began to feel really sad for the poor beast that bring it up and the way the killing them and the book of leviticus opened up and i began to see the priest how they were doing because they started with a lame first then the goat followed and i began to look and say okay i must make sure the way they kill it because paul say we should not eat uh uh i mean a beast that has been uh suffocated or something like that so i need to make sure blood is dripping so i know the people in the church will get the correct meeting if it was in the in the market paul says that don't worry about it for motive's sake you go ahead and buy it so don't go to walmart and ask people how did you kill this amen that's jehovah weakness amen and you if you in the market you're a walmart just get the meat the same slab and go eat but when i'm in a sort of house i want to make sure that meeting center with the word oh my god you look at you oh my god so everybody is welcome amen blessed be the name of the lord i want to mention something before we go at the end i was studying and brother branham was speaking and i heard this quote coming up brother branham say i like to worship don't you and congregation says now we don't come to church just to hear a sermon that goes with it but we come to church to worship worship in the spirit and in truth you have heard the truth that is the word in other words the sermon see now to worship is to express yourself to him see oh i love that man of galilee give us a little cord on that in other words branham was preaching when he finished preaching they begin to lead song and brother branham said that part of the service is a worship time so when we finish the sermon don't have a habit to be outside standing there and talking stay here because the sermon is finished it is time to start worshiping express unto god his gratuitous and everything that he did for you amen if it's not possible don't go outside don't stay on the window okay blessed be the name of the lord let's go to isaiah 14. somebody put a question this morning how high is too how high is too high for women's heel have not even touched it yet what is steven is it two millimeter two centimeter three millimeter till i preach on that first and then we see if you're going to ask that question amen yeah once we get prepared through this we finish then we open the high heel and then i let that quest i'll let you answer that question when you see what high heel does amen in the scripture and in the message we go in the bible then we pull up then we get in the message amen yeah i have a little chart for you i will show you so you make sure you get it not in this message we don't wear high heels no you gotta know why you don't wear high heel where is he written in the scripture and where is it in the message of the hour amen isaiah chapter 14 blessed be the name of the lord you remember last sunday right you know where we stopped right yeah god wanted to express himself in attribute and to do that he needed a woman so the conception of the brothers in the message toward women need to be we need to remove that old computer that look at sister like sex slaves anyway i'm talking to this church women must be respected amen why didn't god create himself and come into the world in a man jesus christ you have to borrow a woman isaiah 14 verse 12 the sister dead the sister there and you can't live without her i'm glad the sister says amen [Laughter] verse 12 how are you falling from heaven oh lucifer when my brother mentioned here pride i was like okay i got the signal how are you falling from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning you might be seated how are you cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations this is isaiah explaining lucifer for you have said in your heart that's where the problem started in the heart malachi 4 in the heart returned our heart for you have said in your heart this is where sin started that's why jesus said it's not what enter in the men's heart but it's what is coming out of the heart amen for you have said in your heart no wonder he was in eden you remember that out of court eden and then the garden of eden and he was in the garden of eden you have said in your heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god how many knows who are the stars of god the stars of god are the children of god amen but lucifer wanted to exalt himself above the stars of god because a star of god is just like god amen that's why satan told jesus if you be the son of god turn this stone into bread he knew that the son of god is exactly a god that's why he want to rise not only above god but even the star of god because we sit on the throne with him we are the wife of christ we and god are make sense okay so when the devil needs you he's attacking god amen so above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation which congregation before the foundation of the world amen in the sides of the north you remember psalm 78 jerusalem was in the north amen and he want to build his city on the north verse 14 i will ascend above the heights of the cloud i will be like the monster so somebody wanted to be like god amen wanted to be king remember that amen want to be king a hazardous let's go to ezekiel chapter 28 the heart of lucifer wanted to exalt himself a pride sin began with pride sin originated in heaven and it started with a proud spirit that's why proud spirit is a very wicked thing you are nobody you are nothing you are just saved by god's grace period you are nothing if the life is taken out of you we're going to go ahead and bury you and it's going to be the skin worm and everybody destroying your body so we are nothing the only one that must take preeminence is the lord jesus christ [Applause] amen ezekiel chapter 28 verse 1 if you there you can say amen the word of the lord came again to me saying son of man say to who this man is called the prince do you know that jesus also is a prisoner okay let's see who this man is speak to the prince of terrorists that says the lord god because your heart isaiah just told us somebody in heaven who has a heart lifter amen now he said because your heart is lift up spirit of pride and you have said i am so if you notice this is not a king really this is someone it is not really a man there is somebody there amen this person want to be god and he says that he is already god amen i am a god i sit in the seat of who do you see how he exalted himself in the seat of god make sure you watch his you you watch your bible in the midst of the seas yet you are a man so this man received an anointing and that anointing make him feel and take the place of god but we know that in heaven the one who wanted to be god was lucifer so this man was incarnated by satan anybody kill you now amen in the midst of the sea yet you are a man and not god though you set your heart as the heart of water you see amen behold you are wiser than daniel there is no secret that can hide from you if you read like this you're not going to understand this this is irony the prophet is speaking and he's talking to this man the true translation says do you think you are like daniel because daniel had a wisdom that came from god and daniel taught the king that nobody can interpret the dream the only one that interprets the dream is god so the prophet is talking to this man in irony telling him that you're just a man but you want to make yourself like god are you wiser than daniel amen make sense are you wiser than daniel there is no secret that can hide from you because there was no secret that could be hidden to daniel no matter what dream you brought to dania he will give you the interpretation so they compare him like daniel they say do you think you were at the level of daniel do you think you are as high as daniel do you think like nothing no mystery is hidden from you if no mystery was hidden from you how you didn't detect moses in pharaoh's house when he was growing up why you didn't kill moses amen moses was right there with pharaoh and you fear you fed moses and make him grow until he comes and destroy you if you think nothing was hidden for you why you didn't detect moses why you didn't detect jesus christ why you didn't chase him to egypt because the seventh seal was locked amen verse four with your water wisdom and your remember the two trees in the garden of eden the two women and the two wisdom with your wisdom and your understanding you have gotten your riches and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures by your great wisdom there is a great wisdom here and by your traffic you have increased your riches and your heart is lift up because of your riches therefore that says the lord god because you have set your heart as the heart of god you see that behold therefore i will bring strangers upon you the terrible of the nation and they shall draw the sword against the beauty of your water so what made this man think like he is god what took this man and and and and bring him to this state that he elevated himself is his wisdom he brought so much about the wisdom the beauty of this wisdom amen everybody clear because the bible says and they shall draw their sword against the beauty of your wisdom and they shall defy your brightness everybody clear job to verse 12. son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of who over there he was a priest now it is a is jesus a king too so this man is both presenting and jesus also is the prince of peace and he is also the king of selema amen everybody here praise god son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of terrorists the same man and say unto him thus says the lord god you just seal up the psalm you are the top of everything full of water wisdom and perfect in beauty what a man a man that is perfect in beauty filled with wisdom amen perfect in beauty verse 13 this prince is the priest of which kingdom terrorists the king of who terrorists was terrorists existing in the garden of eden did we have any kingdom in the garden of eden did we have the king in the garden of eden let's see now verse 13. you ready you have been in water was a king in hidden was a priest in hidden the one who can talk in eden was adam and eve but there was one person that can talk also that was who so who is the king of terrorism where did the serpent where did lucifer enter in the king in the in the garden of eden lucifer incarnated the devil incarnated the serpent that serpent is this prince that serpent is this king that's why brother branham say he looks like a man brother branham never gave you the scripture the message is perfectly in line with the scripture amen hallelujah you have been in eden the garden of who so you can see who was he needed so this scripture is not about a king it's about the serpent it's about lucifer you understand now but that serpent was the more subtle perfect in beauty that's why brother branham said he was more beautiful than adam did brother branham give you a scripture you see message is not complicated amen you have been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was your covering the sergius torpes and the diamond the burial the onyx and the jasper and the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle the gold and gold and the workman of your tablet and of your pipe were prepared in you in the day you were created so when they created lucifer they created him with an instrument of music and the first one who invented the instrument of music came from which lineage [Music] that's why cain is off there wicked amen that's why you need to be careful with music amen you are the anointed carib there are four caravans one looks like a lion another one like an ox another one like a man and a fourth one like amigo but there was a fifth one lucifer that's why brother branham said he was the right hand man of god i have a thing in the scripture amen you are the anointed caribbean that covers he's a protector and i have set you so you were upon the holy mountain of god he was there you have walked up and down in the midst of the stone of fire so this is not a natural king 15 you were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created so he was also created you see now till iniquity was found in you isaiah saw it amen by the multitude of your merchandise you have filled the midst of you with violence and you have sinned therefore i will cast you as a profane esau out of the mountain of god and i will destroy you all covering kerem from the midst of the stones of fire watch 17 your heart was lift up pride again because of your beauty you have corrupted your your wisdom by reason of your brightness so it's the wisdom and the beauty of this prince that cause him trouble amen i will cast you to the ground i will lay you before kings that they may behold you everybody clear let's go to ephesians 5 then we're going to pray isaiah 14 spoke about lucifer wanting to exalt himself amen and to be like god ezekiel pick up the same revelation because god doesn't change the revelation he only add more information to help you understand the better so ezekiel explained to us that the problem is that satan was boasting about his wisdom and his beauty amen remember in the garden of eden god took beauty out of adam and put it in ease do you understand in other words i'm not going to fight you like a man i'm going to fight you as a woman okay you a man you want to fight with me i'm going to fight you as a woman everybody here let's go to ephesians chapter five if you dare you can say amen hallelujah ephesians 5 verse 25 amen husband love your wives even as who that's the way you must love your wife not the way america or your country taught you you must forget that you love your wife like the bible tells you that's why i'm bringing everything a responsibility of a man a responsibility of your husband a responsibility of a man this is how you must operate you don't operate with worldly knowledge from books you don't operate with the knowledge you read on amazon amen you treat a woman with the godly knowledge oh my hallelujah love your wife even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for him that he must sanctify this is christ doing it and cleans it with the washing of the water by the world that he presented to himself i already showed you this that you must be working for your wife taking care of her and make her beautiful for yourself amen present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing we already explained to you the change the redemption of the soul and redemption of the body wrinkle but that it shall be holy and without blemish remember the song of solomon so ought men to love the wives as their own water because if a woman was pulled from there from the man amen so when you look at that woman it is nothing but part of you so if you cherish your own body and you don't cherish your wife something is wrong you are destroying your ribs [Laughter] hallelujah oh my god verse 28 so old men love to love their wives as their own body he that loves his wife loves who why because a woman was pulled from man for no man ever yet hated his own flesh amen but nourishes and cherish it even as the lord the lord take care of the church nourish it take care of it so that's the way you must do for your wife everybody clear so far open first corinthians and let's pray first corinthians chapter one you need your bible you need your bible first corinthians chapter one hallelujah let me say is this here as you turning there in revelation 13 verse 8 let's pray first heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us lord we thank you for the great testimony and the life-changing experience we thank you lord father for bringing us together here around the revealed word of the hour lord i have done what any man can do if you give him the ability to do so father now it's your time may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children may the devil in his army be completely sealed out of this place may the holy spirit and the angels of the lord be around lord to minister and to bless your children we commit and humble ourself lord into that presence in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you in revelation chapter 13 verse 8 the bible says that and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him talking about the antichrist whose name are not written in the book of life of the land slain from the foundation of the world the key here is before god created the earth because before god created everything that we see existing upon this planet here god slew the lamb in his own mind amen so when god does something in his mind it is automatically finished amen all that remains is just for god to bring it into manifestation anybody clear hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah we on part 41 amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i'm waiting for the computer to kick in because the slide is loaded amen it's taking time as it's taking time it's going to catch up on me amen so when god in his mind slew the lamb we're just taking the barn the mind of god not in the front part but what i'm saying in the back part amen god in this mind have a and god slew this lamb killed the lamb and when god began to create the universe he began to create the planet he begin to create this and this and that and that we didn't see the land anybody following me we didn't see that lamb when god created the heaven you look at the heaven it doesn't look like a name anybody follow me when god created the earth you get into the earth the earth doesn't look like a lamb when god began to create man man did not look like a lamb when god created the elephant the elephant was just an elephant amen and god began to create the animal god begin to create the crocodile god created the trees and this and everything else but at the seventh day the bible said that god rested because he did what he finished his work amen but in the back part mind of god there was a work that was lingering in the inside of god and that work was blocked you understand me the work was blocked because that work is connected to a death everybody here and that work is connected to a killing somebody something must be killed something must died but when god created eden and created the world everything was perfect there was no death there was no suffering there was no pain there was no sorrow everything was finished god created adam just like he created the animal so when god want to express this plan of killing the lamb there was no door for god to introduce this planet are you following me god had a project in his project he must kill them but he made a way to create that god could not create a lamp that is shrinking god can do that a lamb have to be created first then kill killed everybody understanding me but in order to introduce that killing every door was locked are you following me the crocodile never seen the hippopotamus never seen maybe god came because god had attribute you remember that sunday and he talked to the crocodile he said hey mr crocodile can i hear you he say father you mean healing what is healing [Music] ever clear because that vocabulary never existed ever clear and god talked to the crocodile he said no you know healing means when you are sick he says sick what is sick father he says sick is when you start having pain he said i don't know how to make up because everything is imperfection what do you call sickness god realized that he needed a door anybody there he needed a doll to take his plane and introduce his plan into the human being everybody clear so far is he working let me see now let's see still not click it there don't worry satan he knows what is here it's almost the trail of the serpent [Laughter] that's why he's fighting it it is the trail of the serpent it flows up there amen so god was looking for a door in order to introduce his plan of redemption everybody clear now the first thing that we saw last week is number one a woman is the main door everybody clear now that has been used by the devil to carry and to propagate his seed on first point here it is the devil using the woman everybody clear number two that we saw i'm following what we saw last week number two is the woman was created by god amen message believer remove that thing in your mind that the woman was created by satan satan cannot create the woman was created by god but she was perverted or destroyed by the devil that's what brother pranam called designing designing by perversion not by creation everybody clear number three that we found out that when god created this woman god loaded her with three virtues the first one we have virginity everybody clear the second one is water womanhood and the third one is water motherhood womanhood is the first bait that the devil uses to destroy a woman the devil if he goes straight to virginity he's actually raping a woman because that is against her own will because a woman have the right to say yes or not so the first thing is the devil will work upon the behavior of a woman that's why a woman should not be loosed because the devil will wake you up first and once he convinces you and the womanhood then he takes you to the hotel to destroy your virginity then you ended up pregnant everybody but thank be to god what the devil destroyed in eve in one shot god honored all this virtue by mary [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah was mary a virgin we okay we okay was mary a good woman brother click there hallelujah if you already got it it's still frozen yes click ready no click the next one okay click the next one it's not the devil is a liar okay praise be the name of the lord let's give the lord a clap all right now it's working hallelujah brother brown i'm saying along the road after a while thank you brother ebo thank you brother caleb and after a while a light flashed before her this is mary and she looked standing in that light the little water never seen a vision perhaps before and there stood a mighty archangel standing there he frightened her he won't frighten you yes and there he stood and he said hail mary in other words stop blessed or down now you have lived a good clean life among all these here vulgarity and things here and you have found water with who the reason why gabriel says that you found favor with god brother branham is explaining that because mary lives a pure clean life in other words the womanhood of mary was correct that's why when they told nathaniel that out of nazareth the messiah is coming out nathaniel said can something good come out of water in other words nazareth was a very bad and wicked city and despite the bad of the bad state of the city god kept a virgin and that virgin was pure and she has a good behavior and god wanted to borrow her womb so through mary virginity womanhood and motherhood all has been respected and honored by god amen the devil used evil to introduce sin and god used mary to bring redemption hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord then the fourth point that we saw was that this madding of the serpent with eve introduced the beastly lust into the human being that's why we saw in the leviticus god begin to to give commandment against the union between animal and human everybody clear so far amen then number five that we saw was that this woman was created as a byproduct which peter explained to us that she was a weaker water a weaker vessel now a we found out that god did that for his own pleasure you remember that which was the sovereignty of god amen number two we found out that the woman was treated by satan as a vessel of water dishonored let's go to first peter here and let's see what's going on peter is saying here that likewise your husband dwell with them according to water so peter is saying here the woman was dishonored by the devil amen and the devil designed her by perverting her but to you sons of god amen this is the way you must treat your wife number one you need to treat your wife with water with knowledge what do you mean knowledge brother branham anybody clear i believe in genuine holy ghost water holy ghost knowledge will always punctuate the world with amen when you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the bible you sit down and whiter study it and prayerfully like that and the first thing you know the holy spirit begin to move in after a while you see it ties together and there you got it that is water this is not worthy knowledge hallelujah brother branama this is not worldly knowledge brother branham said knowledge not worldly wordly reasons any kind of worldly knowledge reasons see but faith has no water so godly knowledge comes by faith hallelujah god revealed to you as certain things is going to happen every scientist in the world could tell you it's contrary it will not happen you believe it anyone yes sir he does not reason the bible said we cast down the reasons you don't reason with faith faith has no reasoning faith knows where it is faith acts faith holds on he can't move nothing can move it i don't care what's whatever says this that or other it does not move a bit it stays right there wait wait wait wait don't make any difference it stays right there no matter how long it takes fifth stage right there knowledge not worldly knowledge but water heavenly knowledge and heavenly knowledge when god is the found the fountain of all knowledge and god is there and then if you get heavenly knowledge you believe the water and you reason anything by the water everything that you do in your life must be filtered by the word of god yes sir everybody here everybody understanding me so that is the way you live with your wife you live with your wife by the word you treat your wife like christ treated you blessed be the name of the lord he said dwell with them according to water that was one number two giving her water giving her honor because the devil treated her as water at the vessel of dishonor giving her honor and as unto a water we want you to remember she's a weak of herself everybody here and us being here together of the same water we explained to you last week that she also received the holy spirit everybody just like you everybody because if you don't do that the bible says that your prayer will be water because you are mistreating a daughter of god take malachi chapter 2 hallelujah keep first correcting blessed be the name of the lord brothers and brothers in this church our future husband must treat your wife with respect amen she is not a sex slave for your passion amen because as you grow sometimes you don't need it again amen malachi chapter 2. everybody clear and this verse 13 and this have you done again covering the altar of the lord with water so somebody's crying not one person many people many person are crying at the altar who are crying at the altar of god you ready covering the altar of god with tears with whipping everybody there and with crying out in so much that he god regards not the offering anymore or receive it with good will at your water there are many people that are crying at the altar many people are weeping at the altar and because of their crying because of their weeping god stop accepting your offering in other words the cry of those people block your prayers [Music] toward god so who's crying and who's weeping you ready job to verse 14 yet you say wherefore in other words why because the lord has been witness between you and the water do you have your bible with you so who was crying at the altar who was weeping at the altar and the whipping of the wife and the altar block your prayers this is what peter said be careful because your prayers are gonna be blocked this is in the old testament and peter pulls it up and put it in the new testament that's why business don't work that's why trouble don't work that's why headache in your life because somebody has been crying for being mistreated for years years being bitten years being looked down beers being spoken down and treated like a sex slave and in their heart they like this message we are treated like animals because of this message because of this message you go to the party the man in suit look at the way the women are dressed how many suits do you have how many clothes your wife have [Applause] amen women that should be up proud they're walking like they low down [Music] hallelujah it's in the black dog territory hallelujah they said be the name of the lord let's continue because the lord has been witness god was watching what you were doing in your house between you and the wife of your water not an old woman the youth one where she really wanted her husband amen against whom you have dealt treacherously yet is she your god is calling her a companion what are you calling your wife to god your wife is a companion eve was living with adam good happy without sex hallelujah amen yet she is your companion and the wife of your water you made a covenant at the altar remember continue verse 15. and did not he make one yet had he the residue of the water when god created man man was created male and female one yet when he put adam on the flesh he kept the woman everybody feel me are you following me hallelujah and world for one that he must seek a godly seed anybody can understand therefore take heed to your spirit amen and let none deal treacherously against the wife of your in other words be careful when god created man he created male and female together you were equal when god created you what he did he used man and he left the woman behind because he needed to unfold the plan of redemption he needed a dog to introduce the lamb that's why when the lamb came john the baptist said behold the lamb of god that take away the sin of the world that lamb came through mary through a woman let's go to verse 16 and the lord the god of israel says that he does water he hate water what else putting away means god hates water hallelujah he hates divorce for one covers violence with his government says the lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that you deal not water treacherously why i'm gonna block your offering i am not gonna accept your prayer anymore because you have been mistreating this woman things don't work in your life watch what you have been doing to your wife everybody clear so far everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord god said give her honor why because the devil treated her as a vessel of water but we found out that god opened a door to make her a weaker vessel why the weak vessels when we looked on that weak vessels that will see everybody here weak vessels we found out that the crocodile taught god that i don't know what you mean by sickness god tried to explain it to the hippopotamus hippopotamus say i still don't understand what sickness means because you must feel sickness everybody clear watch this brother brother a cancer will be a scavenger are you following me the basil it's dead things cancer usually come from a water if there is no bruise there is no water god already created everything but god has a lamb that need to be killed if god created eve by the spoken word the last door of god is blocked no plan of redemption can be opened up now the lord lucifer already was bragging in heaven and lucifer divided heaven already and lucifer brag about his wisdom everybody follow me and his beauty against the wisdom of god everybody and against god so the very creation of a woman as a wicked vessel happened because there were two wisdom that were fighting in heaven you understand the devil brag on his wisdom god also bragging with his wisdom so they left heaven and they came down to the battleground to fight do you follow me then god say let me fight you and i'm going to show you how i'm going to fight you you're following me stay put deborah's first he bruises and you are full of little cells and one of those leaders here get water and he water very badly then the first things there is a water not the life that was there another water so satan cannot enter somewhere if there is no breach you follow me satan needs a backslider satan needs somebody that is bruised that's where he uses as a goal you follow me god kick him out of heaven everybody when he came down in the garden of eden as the priest of terrorism everything was perfect satan could not deceive adam because adam was the original creation nothing could be there to be deceived by the devil so the devil in the garden of eden was locked by the chains of circumstances you follow me that's why brother branham said in the millennium you follow me we will be there but because we have glorified body the devil have nobody to deceive he won't be again locked by circumstances because we are back in eden do you follow me from the garden of eden to the garden of eden men never fulfill one day because one day is a thousand years to the lord that's why god gives a millennium and say come and let me show you that man can do that you follow me the two wisdom are fighting let's continue blessed be the name of the lord the devil where did he come from think of it it's not complicated where did he come from the devil that life and he takes him to them the devil cannot do water the devil only water we already explain you that he can't create he preferred the first thing he has to uh the first and first he has to have a way he need the door ask the doctor if your body was perfect and like god made it in the beginning it would be water to get water they must kill a lamb god have attributed he's a savior he's a healer he's a protector all those that should be deluxe lucifer is bragging hallelujah but they dare forehead to do what are we okay do you follow me the therefore have to find the water somewhere to dwata [Music] so god took his instead of creating it he stopped he pulled the rib from adam a product finished and he worked on it and offered a weakness and put it there and said come on and get it do you follow me when god created every animal bread fishes the only the the most pretty oh the most beautiful is who the mail ever clear even the lion you will see the man lion with all the fur not the female every creature demands the most what beautiful but lucifer brag on two things he brag on water and what [Music] are you following me that's why if the bible says that the fruit was uh did their food look pleasant and to give somebody what wisdom to make someone wise that was the wisdom amen and he brought on water because he was the most perfect perfect in beauty when god created that weakness follow me very carefully do you follow me and sister you're gonna understand you're high heel down the road when god created that weakness god has to make that weakness attractive do you follow me do you follow me then god took beauty not in adam and put beauty on the woman anybody here then when the devil looked at the woman she is most beautiful the man and she also have what weakness take first corinthians hallelujah god did it because he want to explain what anybody clear that's a wisdom of god that's why paul say oh uh unsearchable is the riches of christ because it's blowing his mind the way god operates let's go to first corinthians chapter one verse 20. if you dare you can say amen hallelujah you there stay put if you sleepy wake up there stand right there like somebody on the back i'm not saying you're sleeping but just stand there you'll be good i don't have any problem amen everybody clear i don't want you sleeping you come up with a question pastor how much do how was this this and i preached it in the church amen first corinthian one you there verse 20. everybody there few people everybody there okay where is the water where is the scrub where is the dispute of the world has not god made water the wisdom of water there is to wisdom there is a wisdom of this world and the wisdom of god remember in james 3 that wisdom is earthly essential devils do you remember that you remember that do you remember that okay james 3 14 and 15 21 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not who there is two wisdom there there is a wisdom of god and the wisdom of the world and the world used their wisdom and by using their wisdom they missed god we clear now missed god knew not god he please god you follow me by the foolishness of the water preaching to serve them that do water go to chapter two right there where you are drop to verse six however we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of water there's two wisdom come on no of the priests of this world that come to water the wisdom of lucifer comes to nothing ever here jump to verse seven but we speak the wisdom of who god in a mystery you see two wisdom there there is a fight of wisdom follow me in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the water before the world began what was the wisdom everybody follow me crust slain christ killed follow me very carefully everybody clear before the world to our water so what god had in his mind to kill the lamb to dare to destroy the lamb was something for our glory you follow me that glory was blocked because there is no entrance into the world so god must make way to provide for that glory to be introduced and to also prove lucifer that i am the head are you following me so the woman became the center of attraction god want to use the woman that they follow someone that uses the woman you understand now you understand why a woman is sacred if god take a hold of a woman god will make many miracles and wonderful [Music] god use one woman and introduce the messiah and when satan also take hold of a woman he really destroys him we okay we okay let's go back to our scripture verse eight which none of the water the princes of this world know forehead day water they would not have water they would not have done water the water if they knew that god wanted to kill a lamb the smartest thing satan would have done is keep jesus alive you follow me but because they did not know the wisdom of god they did exactly what god intended for them to do are you following me are you following me if they know the wisdom of god they will not have crucified christ it will block the plan of god because crucifying christ is for our glory [Applause] it gets yummy alright hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord everybody clear so far go to acts 13. oh my god i feel like i'm in eternity brother robert hallelujah at the chapter 13 blessed be the name of the lord i gotta dig like this so you know how to respect your wife hallelujah add to chapter 13 verse 27 are you there yes sir are you there for day that dwelt at jerusalem and who rulers because they knew him not are you watching your scripture are you still looking i'm gonna give you time i want to make sure you get it you got it okay let's go because they knew not they knew him not no yet the voice of the water they never understood god and they also missed the prophet because the prophets were prophesying of the messiah god in sandra times and davos manner spoke to her father by the water missing the prophet you miss the mind of god [Applause] [Music] hallelujah he said because not yet the voices of the prophet which are red in every water they have done water them in doing water they did exactly the plan that god did let's go back to first question one hallelujah the battle of wisdom the two wisdom are fighting are you there are you there god want to show the devil who is the devil is bragging of his wisdom but in order to attract the devil the devil only work by weakness god created a weakness and put it there and make it look beautiful so satan can approach it and behind that the whole plan of redemption is waiting [Applause] [Music] i wish i had time i'm gonna get to the trail are you there let's go to first corinthians 20 again at first corinthian we were on verse 20. are you there jump to verse 24 but to them which are called both jews and growing crush the who and the water ever clear job now because the foolishness of who is water when lucifer looked he said this is a piece of cake how did he make such a mistake he created a beast like this he created a being like this the foolishness of god is stronger than mine hallelujah everybody there the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the water the water you now reading read it with me the water the weakness of god is water then water what you think is weak that is where god is so powerful a woman a weaker vessel [Music] god created a woman a weak vessel but the weakness of god is more powerful than men [Applause] are you there are you there you see that woman fever like this she's more powerful than a man [Applause] [Music] that's why she can bear a conception and she can move on she can cook she's pregnant she can go to work she's pregnant what kind of strength is this give a man just a backache he can't take it but the woman is throwing up yet she rolls up and she's cooking the weakness of god is stronger than men hallelujah the weakness of god the weaker vessel of god is stronger than man oh my god blessed be the name of the lord are you ready job to verse 26 for you see your calling those that are in the church those that are in the bread of jesus christ you see your calling brethren how that not many water is saying here if you watch the bride of jesus christ if you watch the church of god you will see that the church doesn't have powerful people the people in the church are usually weak [Music] let's go so you see your calling present how that not many they are wise but there are not many because you're going to boast not many men after the flesh wise after the flesh not many water not many water and water god don't want the people that are powerful are you there he loves the weak one [Applause] because the bride was created in weakness that's why when you are powerful like moses god have to break you and to make you weak and when moses is not reasoning anymore then moses come up now you week let's go to egypt now i can use you are you there when you are powerful god doesn't want to use you are you there god love does weakness he look at paul he pulled him outside down and he struck him with blindness then paul humbled himself then he said now i got you this is where i want you where you are broken like this you yes you're going to egypt i'm 80 years old i wake up with headache yes that's the way i want to use you that's the way i'm going to show pharaoh who i am are you there when he steps in egypt are whiskey like this let my people go he smells like sheep he is dirty he's already weak 80 years old but that is what god took to turn egypt upside down because the weakness of god is power than man hallelujah job to second corinthians we're on chapter go to chapter 2 let me see my time i'm okay it's like we're in eternity everybody here chapter 2 verse 1 and i present this is paul when i came to you came not with water why paul why you don't want to show people how wise you are why you don't want to show people your degree your phd your doctor degree why not with excellency of speech or of what declaring to you the testimony of who for i determine not to know anything among you except who karma and him what [Music] stop paul is saying when i come in the church i want to know how many things two things i want to know jesus christ i don't want to know your trouble your problem but this jesus that i want to know i want to know him as hell why do you want to know jesus as crucifer why you don't want to know jesus as a healthy man why you want to know jesus when he was at the weakest point of his life why you don't want to know jesus when he was leaving the sick why you don't want to know jesus when he was walking on the water why do you want to know jesus only when he is water [Music] are you ready take second corinthians chapter text second corinthians keep your finger right there take second corinthians chapter 13. ii corinthians 13 glory be to god second corinthians chapter 13 ii corinthians 13. are you there everybody there i want everybody to be there everybody there okay are we there all right jump to verse four amen second corinthians 13 verse four are you there are you there why paul do you want to know christ as what let's read hallelujah for okay somebody already got it somebody got it somebody is already saying amen okay okay somebody's smiling already everybody clear now did you see it did you see it let's read it now so though he was what through what christ was crucified how paul said when i come to you i want to know jesus christ as water i want to know jesus christ when he was the weakest hallelujah i wonder for though he was crucified through what weakness yet he lives by the power of god for we are for we also are what weak in who [Music] makes sense god wants you to get in him and when you get in him you are partaking of the weakness of god but the weakness of god was to take the sting of death out of lucifer that's why paul said death where is your water he took the weakness to cup to captivate lucifer like come over here come over here come over and lucifer is begging i got him i got him when he snapped crashed they look at him they say loser are you there when lucifer want to pull his thing is left there he want to move he said no he doesn't belong to you anymore hallelujah hallelujah let's go back to first corinthians chapter 2 blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah verse two you ready for i determine take your time hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah you there for i determined not to know anything among you said who and him water in other words i came not with power i came with weakness and i wanna also among you see christ in the same weakness hallelujah jump to verse four and my speech and my preaching was not with entrancing word of water the power of wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and in water that your face should not stand in water but in the power of water everybody clear blessed be the name of the lord we there we already gathered brother branham says this he said then if i could call it a text i like to use this perfect water by perfect water [Music] it is if we have water we have water why is brother problem says that where did he get it are you there god created a woman a weaker vessel the weakness of god is more powerful than men are you there it is the simplicity of the gospel that staggers the people they try to make it a great intellectual something [Music] another religious spirit when it's water but god take the very tool of water and water and what to work his work with that is the only in god's water satan thought that was his tool he didn't know what god was doing with the weakness he created in a woman are you there this great first battle that was ever thought beginning when michael and his angel fought against lucifer and his angel he first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was water thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on water then the battle from angel became water now we're in the garden of eden we're coming from eternity ever here so far blessed be the name of the lord paul in first corinthians 12 he said nail much more those members of the body which seems to be more water are you there more fever or water are you there the woman daddy that's in the garden of eden that looks like she is feeble she is more and those members of the body which we think to be less water upon these will bestow more abundant water that's why peter said give her honor you understand now because she is the feeble part you must give more attention to the feeble part that's why women loves attention [Applause] are you there they want one she's talking you focus on her talking to you you're watching over there go ahead she loves attention stop your politics put a pulse turn around and give her respect what can i do for you hallelujah and our uncommonly pardoned have more comeliness abundant for our calmly part have no need the strong one don't need adam was the strong one he doesn't need anything he doesn't need redemption he doesn't need anything amen but god has tempered the body together having given more water who did that god has given more abundant honor to what god himself gave more honor to the woman amen second corinthians chapter 12 verse 9. and he said unto me my grace is what sufficient for thee for my water is made water in water so the strength of god was expressed in a woman god created a woman as a weaker vessel are you there and then the strength of god is made perfect not with the strong with the weakness oh my god look at paul when he caught that revelation he said most gladly therefore i would rather do whatever in my water how do you want to glory in your infirmity because i understand that when i'm suffering it is a way for him to come are you there are glory in my infirmities that the water of christ may work if you are boasting the power of god live are you there but if you are weak you are humble the more humble the more weaker you are before god the more power god put on you [Applause] hallelujah therefore i take pleasure in water in water in water in water perfect in distresses for who so when i am water then i am water [Music] why god created her a weaker vessel are we okay are we okay are we okay that's why god usually comes when you are in the weakest moment [Music] when you are tight when all hope is gone that's when he shows up because there he's more powerful there you're not gonna use your reasoning you are surrendering he just take you up and pull you out of order hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let's go here did you ever hear this now let me tell you this and keep it real put this in your water why brother brother you ready brother robert a chain did you get it a cham is it's water and it's water oh my god did you understand what it means do you understand what it means this is it anybody knows what a chain is a chain look like this anybody clear right this first chain here is 200 pound hey but here this chain here is 400 pound this chain here is 600 pound this chain here is 75 pounds are you following me if you look humanly speaking this chain you would say wow this is 200 pound how can you take something that is 200 pound and break it you won't do it how can you take something that is 400 pound and breaking no how can you take something that is 600 pound and breaking so this chain is strong if they ask you how strong is this chain you will say it's 600 pounds it would take 600 pounds for you to break because the biggest one is water brother branham say that's an error but random says that even though this is 200 pounds even though this is 5 400 pounds even though this is 600 pounds no matter how many pounds you have the weakest pound is the pound of the whole chain did you get it or you want me to repeat it if they ask you what is the strength of this pound of this chain the strength of city of district of this chain is 75 pounds why because when you bring you follow me you follow me you follow me when you bring 50 pounds this chain will not break because 50 200 is far greater than 50. four hundred five four greater than fifty six hundred five five four greater than fifty and seventy five is greater than fifty the chain will hold you follow me but if you bring 76 pound you follow me this chain this one will stand still this will stand still this will stand still this will give up break it down brother stephen this is daddy daddy he's 50 years old this is mama she is 46 years old this is big brother he's 20 years old anybody clear this is a little brother he's nine years old are you there are you there if you all are put into a rift do you follow me you follow me there is a valley there is a cliff somewhere and there is water down the cliff like a canyon amen if somebody want to fall you follow me and the one who fought first is daddy so that is in the bottom there then the little brother of nine years old hold daddy are you there then mommy hold him then big brother is on the top pulling the one who get tired quickly is the nine years old are you full are you following me because he can bear no more lord than what he can and the one who's going to release the hand and kill daddy is going to be the nine years old the cham is the strongest in its weakest link the weakest link will be the first one to give up and god created everything in the chain [Music] he created adam he created the hippopotamus he created the elephant he created the zebra he created the monkey and then he created the wall manner and the woman was the weaker vessel so when satan pulls the one who fall is the woman because the chain is its strongest in his water so the power of god is expressed in the weakness of a woman when you are weak this is where the strength of god comes when god comes he's not gonna protect this one he won't protect this one he won't protect this one god will come and just hook the nine years old and everybody else is saved the salvation of humanity rested on eve praise gather a channel is it strongest and it's water that's right it is not stronger than its weakest link matter how strong these are built this is build up if it's got a weak link that's 75 there is where she it is no stronger than that now if you possess you say i got this this this you don't have this there is where she breaks if you got this and you have not got that she breaks right there you got this you have not got that's where it breaks everybody clear hallelujah let me see where we are hope i gotta head to the airport notice there is nothing designed to stoop low or to be filthy by the water a dog can do it now you understand what random now a half can do it a bird can do it original creation original creation no animal is immoral nor can be for it was not designed so it can be a female dog can be immoral a female dog cannot be immoral a female bird cannot be immoral why original creation a woman is the only thing that can water because of weakness because the land must be slain hey but here now you see where satan went do you see how you study marriage and divorce you go through what we want and you go back listen to marriage and divorce and you will see how you're going to listen now marriage and divorce compared to what you listened before you see now do you see where satan went but still she has the one that has got the power to say or what she depends on where she wants to hold herself now here we can see plainly the water where he comes in there is only one place he could notice the reason that animal could do it a female animal they were in the original but a woman was not in the original god wanted to use satan like come here bite this one and i will prove you that my wisdom is greater than you everybody clear everybody clear this weakness i'm going to touch this and then we stop this weakness here of the original creation cd is a weakness that was found in the body or in the flesh because the woman by spirit was with adam amen it was in the flesh that she was a by-product brother branham hallelujah now and he comes and foundeth them water this is jesus and say unto peter salmon slippest da could not that watch one hour watch here and do what lest he enter into temptation the spirit is water truly ready but the flesh is water jesus understood that that by spirit you wanted to do it your problem is in the flesh everybody and again he went away and pray and speak the same word and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were water neither was they want to answer him they were so tired yet they want to do the work of god everybody clear she is designed alone for filth and unclean living let me jump here a dog or any animal once every year and that's for her babies not for sexual pleasure but for her water that's a tough one let's get it this weakness that is in the flesh eh it is linked with pleasure of the flesh hallelujah all right brother branham say a dog or any other animal have sexual relationship once a year and that's for her baby and that's it not for sexual pleasure anybody clear but for what just to procreate it's a certain season it happened that say the animal continued their life it's a different for a woman woman is baby plus but a woman is designed for any time she desires i got some stuff crossed out here now you can imagine the rest a dog can a woman can i hope that the holy spirit revealed to you the rest of it are crossed out here anybody she is the only specie special female that is made prettier than the everybody clear there is not another species among anything all other creatures of god is beautiful male such as in animal birds and so forth always the male is what beautiful where do you get this brother branham where do you get this genesis chapter 18 you ready and he said elohim came to abraham and then him was sitting and abraham went and cooked things and they brought him and they gave it to him and elohim says that you know what where is sarah because sarah was the one that had trouble and he said sarah is over there he said you know what i will come in the time of life and sarah will have a baby and sarah laughed now let's see this and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to autumn elohim sarah need today baby are you there hallelujah brother branham just explained that every other animal that was from the original creation they go one time they have baby and that's it that's how the whole nature run in continuity amen but the woman is different because she was a weakness she was uh she was uh created as a weaker vessel are you there now when elohim come to abraham you follow me elohim want to visit sarah one time you follow me elohim say i will come only at the time of life elohim stay connected with the original clock you follow me elohim was following the clock that he created the world the clock is one time that's a wait next year one time that's it so when he comes he's speaking to sarah according to the original creation are you following me yet sarah was part of the byproduct you follow me now sarah is answering elohim reminding him something hallelujah elohim said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of love and lord sarah thy wife shall have a water i'm just coming to give her a baby because this is what i do for the crocodile this is what i do for the elephant this is what i do for the hippopotamus this is what i do for the fishes i give them one time they got their baby and we continue the flow sarah say you forgetting something do you know how you created my great great great great grandma you didn't put her in the original creation where did brother branham got this now sarah heard it in the tent though which was water and abraham and sarah were water and were streaking in what and he sees to be with sarah after the money of water she had no more period therefore sarah did what within herself saying after i am what's old shall i have what sarah was not looking at the baby [Music] hallelujah for sarah it is a pleasure he's reminding elohim that this is how you created us instead of thinking shall i have a baby sarah says shall i have pleasure and that's why brother branham said she was created for what did god problem give you a scripture the message is perfectly aligned with the bible everybody clear i'm heading to the airport first timothy chapter five the bible said now see that is a water a widow lost a husband indeed and desolate trusted in god we explain to you when a woman is a widow her head automatically is crushed and continue in supplication and prayer night and day but she that liveth in water is water make sense because the woman is under a different circle [Music] because of the weakness when she remained widow she's a door to trouble you follow me because she was living with her husband that's why paul said do not take widow only when they are past 65. the younger one let them do what mary second timothy chapter 3 having a form of godliness by denying the power thereof from such dewater for of this sort brother kelly our day which creep into water this was you follow me and lead the water silly water laddered with water led the way with water because there is a door right there that's why when jesus came and he looked at the pharisee brother kelly he saw what the pharisee were doing to the widows that's right are you there are you there that's why john the baptist looked at the firm at the pharisee and he said you snake in the grass in other words you are seed of the serpent you are the one that go after women for pleasure preachers after women for pleasure matthew 24 23 war unto you who and pharisee hypocrite for he devoured the water because you're taking advantage of that weakness jesus saw it on the pharisee they were there making long prayer but every widow in the church they are knocking at the door at night because they were taking advantage of that door are you there that's why i'm gonna say this for this church and we stop i think if anybody wants to be this fellowshipping will be because of water or something like that that he had that he was not a fit person like a man coming in here defiling our girls or insulting our women and things like that and still professing to be one of us here now if he is out somewhere else coming in why we have to do something about it in other words we must protect the woman because we understand that she's built differently you follow me but when it comes to a person like that an immoral person trying to make love to our water and insult our water you know something another like that or do something immorally around here or taking our little boys out and making pervert out of them or something those things should be taken up and then that fellow should be water [Music] from the water and not permitted to water because we are not supposed to do water if in this church young men follow me pretty good if in this church the parent report to me that you slept with a younger sister you slept with another one you slept with a third time i will make sure you will never enter this church did you hear me as a shepherd i must protect the women and i must protect the sister are you there if i see you floating around the girls or sleeping with somebody else's wife in this church i will make sure the police officer gets you out of this church [Applause] did you hear me let me repeat it again i myself will call the police and tell the police you are not fitted to stay in this assembly because brother branham said you must be water excommunicated because you are coming in to take advantage of our girls and our sister and our women are you there our women are not garbage can our sisters are not garbage can they must be honored they must be respected they must be treated with dignity are you there young man do you follow me don't come today pastor it was an accident tomorrow pastor it was an accident if you the only one having accident change your driving are you there the women must be protected don't molest a child in this church i'm gonna call the police on you because the bible says the law belongs to the unbeliever are you there you get here respect you want to play around go outside are you there not somebody here you touch sister so i saw you touch sister so and so you touch sister also i will make sure you find another church let's stand [Applause] we don't have that anointing of pharisee taking advantage the mendor the devil but both the devil and god uses the woman the devil come to pervert god wants us to treat our wife with respect honor the beastly lust was introduced by human that's why you need the holy ghost to control your passion and the woman was a byproduct weaker vessels by sovereignty of god not to be treated with dishonor but god uses to display his power because the weakness of god is where the strong is we is where the strength of god is that weakness is a mystery because the lamb was already slain god wanted to introduce the plan of redemption he wanted to show lucifer and he used a woman and enter into the world and destroy the work of satan that's why he went into calvary and he died and the bible said he made a public show of the principalities destroyed them and over there he said it is finished in other words i finished the plan you slain me that's what i wanted to accomplish now let me begin to pull my children home and then through the ages he's picking up his children back and back and putting them in the bread and later on we're going to live with him for eternity amen that is there that weakness is there you need to be guarded that's why the young sister the gospel sounds like he's tight to you that tightness is because god wanted to protect you amen god wants you to have your own husband and protect you you want to do it go in your marriage and have your own husband and live with him remember proverb 5 don't drink of somebody else's get your own system that's what solomon did go with your wife everybody is okay with it but don't take advantage of the woman because she's a weaker vessel amen you're the strong one you know better than that cut it off stop amen this is not a church of uncleanness this is a church of the living god amen when our women are here they need to be respected don't ever dare get in the women bathroom don't try don't try if you don't know which side you belong this is not the church you'll find somewhere the women goes to the women the man goes to the man clear let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your mercy for your love and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for unfolding these things where we can

and now i know how to treat her look look you say you're awful to learn that no no no no no well i got eternity i gotta tell my life's just begun it ain't over it's just getting started look at the smiles on these girls turn around look at the smiles of our women smiling it's about time they got a little bit of respect about time amen and if you ain't got no respect yet just hold on god's got a plan for you let's bow our heads lord jesus oh my it was good when they said unto us let us go to the house of the lord father it's like sitting down at a table of a mini-coursed meal and lord it's

stimulates us lord it makes us happy father lord jesus the gospel isn't dull oh father it gives us life and we have life and we have it more abundantly lord jesus because lord you said the word that i

right hand and our left hand there's a lot of crazy people out in this world on their cell phones texting when they should be paying attention so we need you father more than we ever did but lord jesus christ we just pray that you bring us back the appointed time that we might worship you again in spirit and truth in jesus name amen y'all are dismissed he is [Music] the buildings
