their feet now How could a man just one man with a thousand around him armored and test Warriors with Spears those big helmets that only their eyes showed through How could a man take a Jawbone of a new and beat down a thousand of them at one time while the first lick with that old brittle Jawbone would fly out of pieces on one of those helmets they know that some Supernatural strength when he

so I will try to navigate Wednesday it is not Sunday but we need to move on forward with certain things and let's see how far we can go if we can reach where we get prepared so you'll be ready to chew what we need to bring on Sunday amen so I know you're tired some coming from work and things so stay alert so we can soak this pretty good and move forward amen how many are up to date with the sermon don't get tired I will continue to ask you all over so when we get to Eternity I say I ask them all the time to make sure everybody goes on time amen how many are reading the Cod book one question a day oh God may God help some amen remember this Saturday the third at five o'clock in the church here we just need to talk a little bit maybe an hour and 30 minutes or a couple hours just set certain things so we synchronize together and we stay on the same page amen if you don't know what's going on you won't know how to behave amen you will just come and go but you don't know what's going on spiritually spiritually it's constantly a battle it's a fight all the time so by the time I'm standing here I already won a lot of victories amen you will get it later glory to God Amen good to see everybody back from Thanksgiving let's go to our scripture tonight in Genesis chapter 2. you will get Genesis chapter one and two until you when you sleep you dream about Genesis chapter one and two amen glory to God hallelujah Genesis chapter 2 verse 7. if you're there you can say Amen the scriptures have layers all scripture have levels so you can have one scripture and you have a level so it depends on how you're pilling the level if you go straight on the first level you're going to stay there and get there and move on but under the scripture there is another layer there that you need to dig and you'll find that layer open up and if you dig again you will find the third layer if you dig again you're going to find the seven lathe amen so that's the way the scripture are meant in other words there is a Bible inside this Bible everybody read this Bible that everybody that is Christian but to read the Bible who is in the Bible you need to know the author of the book amen if not you're just going to read the scripture and just go over it and sometimes it's going to get boring because you don't understand what is going on the son of this the son of this the son of this the son of this and the son of this and you like what is going on with this genealogy it looks like it's a genealogy it's not a genealogy at first it's a genealogy but when you open you peel that layer you look under you're going to see things that are different because God is hiding in Simplicity Genesis chapter 7 I'm trying to warm you up amen glory to God verse 7 and the Lord God formed man you might be seated who for men that's pretty good amen so who is the father of Adam but Angelo is working over there so give brother Kelly the microphone amen and if you don't want to say amen I will use a second microphone and give it to somebody else amen do you know that you got microphone up there you know that right you don't know there's a microphone up there so they want you to say Amen so you need to use your microphone and I'll use my microphone so let's make sure everybody use their microphone listen to the sermon over if you if you're not sure I wonder if you go back and listen to the sermon because if you listen to the sermon over you're gonna hear it people over there saying amen so use your microphone I use my microphone you ready okay Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and the Lord God for men so the one who created Adam or the father of Adam is God so the father of Adam is God that's why the Bible say in the Book of Luke 3 38 Adam the Son of God I gave you the scripture over and over you should have it by this time amen so the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground do you see a woman in this picture So Adam have no matter all right I miss you [Music] God bless you where you are I miss you my brother amen because he keep me working and keep me preaching pretty good amen So Adam doesn't have a mother okay amen you say and he breathes into his nostril the breath of life and Man became a living water so Adam was not born by sex amen everybody okay glory to God jump now to verse uh 21. this is Adam created let's look at the wife of Adam because we know so the lamb now has a wife amen if you don't know that woman that's a big trouble and the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall upon who and so who calls Adam to sleep so who started this process who was worried about Adam not having a wife the Lord so everything about Eve didn't start with Satan verse 22 and they read which the Lord God has taken from her man so who took the rib out made a woman so who made the woman so the woman the father or the Creator the creator of the woman of the woman is who do you see a mother over there how did Eve came out so Adam so Eve came out of Adam in other words she came out of her own husband amen we should be good at this time right we already passed that stage so to relax okay and the rib which the Lord God has taken from man made he a woman and brought her to the man a lot of stuff laying right here just without you like reading there amen so we found out here that Eve doesn't have a mother man amen and Eve came with a sex are we okay in other words Adam and Eve didn't have belly button Adam and Eve did not have never [Applause] they didn't have the umbilical cord I know you're struggling with your mind this message is a different language [Applause] let me help you brother Branham someone asked the other day he said brother Branham would there be any difference between Adam and Eve and their children today if they were all naked walking in would their bodies be the same brother Branham say water no sir what is the difference between us and Adam and Eve relax everything is easy and good okay we was coming home from squirrel hunting brother Fred and I and a bunch of them I say no they wouldn't be there same you're doing pretty good my brother say you mean Eve would not be a woman like her daughters and Adam would not be a man like his sons I said in many respects we are the same but not in all water physical respect so what is the difference between us and Adam number one Adam didn't have a mother if they didn't have a mother Adam was born with her sex everybody here is born from sex many different amen and he said what will be the difference I say they would not have any never never now can you say Amen amen they were created right they was not attached to water nothing the message and the Bible are as long as the bear there everybody okay as long as that bears there on everything that is born in this world shows it is it is a water so everybody that is born by sex it's a trouble yes Amen to begin with you keep this I'm preparing you for Sunday amen he said to begin with that is right I said sure there is a difference there will be no never there was not connected to any female to come here so God created them so in other words Adam and Eve didn't have any belly button okay make a good use of your microphone glory to God let's go now to Genesis 3. if you have learned a long time when I ask you a question you know I always have a gun behind so you better respond quickly amen Genesis 3 in other words we try by the best that we can to remain with that word and the message of the hour that's all I know that's all I can feed you let's go to Genesis chapter 3. do you see what I say fight Genesis chapter 3 verse 14 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say and the Lord God say to her the serpent because you have done this you are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon your belly shall you go and thus shall you eat all the days of your life watch now and I will put enmity between you the serpent and the woman so there could not be any friendship between The Serpent and the woman anymore everybody okay and between your the seed of what of who so the serpent has a seed we already went through this everybody okay somebody told someone about the sermon that the pastor was preaching that man who was male and female and I got into the house and the person who said that look at the he's not part of this trade he said you asked the pastor and here I came to do something else I'm right in the middle of a sermon can you explain melon or a male and female I'd say no you bring the Bible I don't want you to live here and say brother Stephen by the time I went one two two twenty minutes the man looked his eyes was wide open I closed there and I was back amen so the serpent has a seed we already know the seed of the serpent I don't know why people fight brother amen it's a waste of time amen and between your seed The Serpent and hair water see Say Amen the Bible said the woman has a seed [Applause] I should be the one doubting because I'm a medical doctor but I learned how to put my medical doctor in the garbage [Applause] when it comes to the word of God a Believer came one time to me I look at the wisdom teeth I say the wisdom teeth need to come out and that person said I will trust God that everything will be all right I don't need to take them out and they quote came straight up to me brother Branham say I will never stand on the way of somebody who want to take God at his word I shut my mouth up and I left the believer till today she's good I learned how to take my doctor and put it down and take the word of God and lift it up [Applause] because heaven and earth will pass away but the word of God will never pass away let every man life every man will be a water only God's word be wanted in this church we preach God's word Oh Glory to God man I feel so good let's preach now so the woman glory to God the woman has a seed whether you like it or not it is that safe the Bible [Applause] the problem is what is the seed of a woman because a woman usually doesn't have a seed that's how you approach the Bible not no no no no that's false no what is God trying to say everybody okay and her seed it shall bruise your water and you shall bruise water it's here everybody okay clear a woman having a seed my goodness [Laughter] verse 16 to the woman he says he didn't say to Eve because he's the one that pulled the wall man out of Adam Adam just gave the revelation of what God did God did the working and Adam gave the Revelation that what God did God made a woo man somebody pull out of me so there is a revelation and a working to the woman he said I will greatly multiply your water so and your water so from here something is introduced here a woman will begin to bring forth children by sex I'm exactly right that's the truth in other words now the woman can become a mother she can have a conception and that happened through sex it was not before God didn't use this route or automatically God created Created that say no intervention of a man a woman no everybody okay and in so why can the curse of the woman be only around her conception all right come on brother you still don't see the serpent see so what caused the original sin it was an apple so the woman eating an apple God doesn't curse the apple he go curse the woman on her conception in sorrow shall you bring forth water children so children now are coming not by the spoken word not by creation they're coming now by a woman amen and you desire a woman through conception and for a woman to conceive you must have the egg and the sperm mixed together everybody okay and your desire shall be to your water and he shall rule over you everybody okay go to Genesis chapter 5. oh Lord it's almost like Sunday 21 minutes reading the description you there verse 1 this is the book of the generation of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him man and water female created he what and he did water bless them so God created them created them and then blessed them not bless him them and call them and their names right one name and that name is Adam glory to God and called their name Adam in the day when they were created everybody okay now let's go to Ephesians 5 and then we pray glory to God Ephesians 5 23. you're there you can say amen for the husband is the head of the wife you begin to get this pretty clear now even as Christ is the head of the church we're dealing with two people there nacho and God Christ and he is the savior of the body everybody okay job to verse 30. he's the savior of the body amen in other words when you have an individual like this I'm just making this simple okay this right here this this okay this is Christ everybody okay everything that is staying here is water the church their body their bribe everybody okay that's the way we work okay so Paul is saying Christ is their head so why does the head come in the airtime so the head will just be working like that huh [Music] I need to make it this way so it can soak pretty good have you seen the head walking like this if you see this there gotta be another party [Applause] you cannot reveal the head without the body oh God oh my God this church God so we are he's the Savior he's the head he's the savior of the okay verse 30 for we are a member of his water body that's why we call Santa the Beloved the the the joint all this terminology amen we are a member of his body of the and of his body Karma of his flesh and of his water so you can see like we are the eve [Music] of Christ we are the woman of Christ [Applause] everybody okay verse 31 for this cause shall a man do it leaves his water his father and water his mouth and shall be join joins me in water United means water aha that's the way you go straight to the point amen and shall be married to his water why so if marriage must come who must bring the marriage God the man must come when the men come he's coming with marriage Behold The Proud gum go I to do what me him he didn't means they go out and they say good morning good morning you're doing okay that say you meet him that's not what they were saying go out to that's why those that were already entered into marriage amen he said for this God shall a man leave a mother and a father father and mother and shall be joined to his wife not somebody else's wife and the two shall be water one flesh so marriage brings back the original picture [Applause] because man was one creation split them you remember on Sunday then marriage through Redemption bring back again and then when they are drawn you cannot play with one no matter how nice one look to you the other one is connected you'll find yourself you fooling yourself between married people yeah you will find yourself in trouble amen this is a great Water mystery but I speak concerning who Christ and the Water Church concerning who Christ and the water let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have just given me but I pray Lord father that's the Holy Spirit can come and move me completely out of the way may you come down and speak to this church in a supernatural way so that the heart the soul can be receiving and hearing the word in the name of Jesus Christ amen hey everybody okay glory to God let's see what is going on here my subject tonight is the four phases of roof the byproduct in type for the last Adam there is a byproduct but that byproduct is in type not for the first Adam for the last Adam or the second Adam my subject tonight is the byproduct in type for the last or the second Adam we are in the threshing floor with roof in the trashing floor this is where the story of roof have opened up to the point where we can clearly see that Redemption and marriage are connected together they are one we explain that on Sunday that's why for roof to get married they gotta be done first the work of redemption everybody okay Ruth could not just come in Israel and get in and get married like that she did that in Moab [Applause] when she was outside of Israel Redemption was not applied to her she got into a false claim everybody okay she could claim to be there the wife of Marlon but she was not introduced to the Commonwealth of Israel yet but she have to leave the land of Moab and come to the land of Israel and show a diligence of character roof on Sunday we found out that both of us we were in God everybody okay open Ephesian one amen amen oh God help me out please I'm a pastor preaching okay when the past are preaching take your break off your time okay [Music] okay everybody okay let's go to Ephesian one you there yeah verse 3. remember when God created Adam he created them and he did what bless them everybody okay a vision one first three blessed be the god you understand what it means remember and father of our Lord Jesus Christ you understand what it means so we are the Lord Jesus Christ were together and both of us were in the mind of God we are talking about the Genesis 1 26 of Jesus he was not enough when he was created wisdom was male and female you remember that the tree of life was male and female remember that [Music] [Applause] this is a different material value amen amen now blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed the womb without spiritual bless it in Heavenly bless his wife amen God blessed faith when they were together we also are blessed we are blessed in Christ amen amen so in Judas is 1 26 there are similarities we came from the same origin Ally amen we have the same father that's why Jesus said when you pray say I remember you remember that from Summer amen we are equal don't worry about it just give me time to reach them and you want to see how you are people now at this point you are you have a Pentecostal understanding that uh Jesus the kingdom now you want to see difference amen God in Jesus and you will see the difference amen amen and the Bible said we are blessed without spiritual blessing in Heavenly places in what all right according as he has done what did what so if he chose us you need where were we [Music] well that's what it said he's not the one in the spirit just like in the first Adam there was no difference between Adam and Eve in the spirit there is no time Dominion given to Adam who wants to sell the Lord [Applause] can you use that's why Jesus said they work you gotta do foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] why do you have to do the work like him foreign he said what did he do what did he do he cleaned out the blackness and made it all work why why there was that see laying down the water yesterday that was that he was God before the foundation of the world if you are a Christian now a genuine predestinated ones he was well you for watching you always was wet in other words you never had that beginning [Applause] [Music] in other words in the spirit there is no difference that's why Paul says this Hallelujah that's why Paul says this he said for ye have not received the spirit of what they get to do what Pentecostal understanding entering God to tremble oh [Applause] [Music] Our Father Amanda the spirit itself very witnessed through our spirit that we are watching God amen amen and his children yes we are sure to help with you so we are crossed our house [Music] we are Chuck every clue all right it's nothing that we suffer with him and we might be also matter so in the spirits there is no difference we and our husband we are awesome [Music] now in Genesis 2 7. Genesis 2 7 of the lamb and also 21 22. what happened in Genesis 2 7 okay glory to God amen glory to God brother but I'm saying you lucky how God placed that God is the water that brought forth who Jesus Jesus and God is a spirit so they could not be any water sex there could not be any sexual desire because if he was then Jesus was now who was not born a water virgin born what are you trying to say brother Stephen this is what I'm trying to say according to Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 of Jesus Christ open revelation 12. Maya I'm good in time so relax if you dare you can say man amen we want to see how was Jesus created in a body everybody okay according to Adam Adam was created from the Dust no sex no father no matter nothing everybody okay according to uh if Eve also came from Adam no matter no sex nothing but just a byproduct now we're talking about the second Adam how was the second Adam created over here there is no difference everything is similarity but remember with the first Adam the spirit was correct but in the body we have similarities and differences so if the first Adam in the body had similarities and differences so the second Adam also in the body must have some and water because God does not change let's go to Revelation chapter 12. I believe it's my battery my brother if you're there you can say a man first one and there appear a great water wonder do you know what that Wonder means it means a Sana they appear a great son if you look at another translation it will tell you probably a son a Wonder it's a sign there was a wonder that appeared there there was a son that appeared there everybody okay and the sun was what a woman in heaven a what a woman do you know that woman do we know her we don't know her her name is a woman remember Adam had a woman there is a woman who is she we need to find out there is a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 Stars I'm skipping this you know that job to verse 2. and she being with water ciao tried traveling in water and paint to the water so the woman was pregnant can you say man this woman is pregnant and she's pregnant with a child the problem is we don't know her husband who is the husband of this woman we don't know number two who is the father of this boy we don't know and who is this woman herself we don't know everybody okay we're talking about the Genesis 2 7 of the second Adam now we are invest the job to verse 5. and she brought forth a water now it's more clear so the child could be a woman a girl or a boy now it's a difference we know clearly that the child is not a girl okay the child is a man if you notice the Bible doesn't say a Boy Child [Applause] scripture don't play with water the Bible said amen child so even though you see this child as a baby [Applause] when you see that baby crying and drinking milk that baby is a man that's why brother Branham said he was Jehovah crying oh Lord have mercy are we okay he said if she was brought forth a man shot this Manchester so this child we know now that it's a man and this man Chad has to do what this Manchester who has to rule how many nations All Nations you're going to come up with the issue so this man's child will rule all missing who's that person amen All Nations the word caught up brother Branham say it's the word for rapture you shall be changed and be caught up in other words this child will receive a rapture we're trying to find out who this woman is this child will receive a rapture Lord help me move forward and he will be ratchet wrapped he will be caught up to water to God discharge when he is gonna be raptured he will go into God everybody okay so if this child going to God where did he came out everybody okay can you preach with me because I know somebody who said I came from God and I will go back to what God in Acts chapter 1 verse 9 they saw him going up and the Bible say a crowd came you know that's for you yes yes do you know that scripture amen if you don't know raise your hand keep your finger here let's go to act chapter one I don't want to lose somebody let's go to Acts chapter one verse 9. let's go quick so we can move if you dare you can say Amen and when he had spoken Jesus these things why they be held he was what taken out everybody okay and they do any what cloud receive him out of the waters everybody clear so let's go back so this child will be raptured caught up and what happened when he got there a crowd came and did what everybody okay a cloud open and Jesus entered the crowd and the cloud closes so in other words he must be during the day everybody okay now everybody okay it happened during the day no wonder the Rapture happened and he said and I'll leave it alone everybody okay everybody okay he said and he the child was caught up to God and to his water so this child not only does he enter God but he goes to the throne of God so who is this baby everybody okay and to God's Throne so who is this baby somebody is afraid who is this baby Jesus Christ Jesus jump to verse 17. everybody okay and the dragon was angry with who the woman do we know her she was angry with the woman amen and went to make war with their remnant of water per se how many so the woman has a now we found out that right here we back again with the seed of the woman [Music] so this woman that brought forth Jesus Christ is the woman that was prophesied in Genesis chapter one that the woman will have a seed everybody okay now everybody okay now so the woman that will have a seed is a woman that will give birth to Jesus Christ because Paul said in Galatians 3 that Abraham and his seed won not many ganation three you know the scripture everybody okay what does it mean a seed of a woman everybody okay the seed of a woman does not mean that a woman have a sperm [Music] everybody okay the seed of a woman needs that the woman has a pregnancy that has nothing to do with sex [Applause] the woman has a pregnancy that is not connected to any masculine [Music] foreign Luke chapter one [Laughter] oh my God oh my God Lord help me I don't know why this went back we already went through this we already went through this we already went through this we already went through this we are here okay brother pradam say that that woman in journalist in Revelation 12 that was a virgin woman how did Brother Branham know now you begin to see the description amen you begin to see she was a real lady how beautiful she stood now glory to God the Bible says this in Isaiah before we get to look therefore the Lord himself shall give you a water the Lord himself shall give you a water sign everybody okay and behold the water version shall water in either way the woman will have a seed will have a baby but that baby will be by a virgin woman thank God he happened back in the day because if it would happen today somebody would say they did in vitro so God made sure it happened before your technology everybody okay and then the Bible says Behold a virgin shall do what you can see and bury Waters and his shall call his name who Emmanuel behold Matthew a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a water son and they shall call his name who amen which being interpreted which being interpreted is what god with us so this child is God everybody okay that's why he was caught up to God and he can go to the throne of God because he's God and he can rule all the nation because he's God everybody okay the Bible say here unto us a water is born unto us a water and the government shall be upon his shoulder his name shall be covered wonderful and water counselor and the water Mighty God and everlasting water father foreign let's go to Luke chapter one I still have some minutes so chill out I'm gonna run Luke chapter one if you're there you can say Amen job 2 verse 26. amen and the sixth month Diego capria was sent to God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a water version it's passed to her whose name was what Joseph and the house of the House of David and the Virgin name was who Mary everybody clear job to verse 30. and the angel said to her fear not Mary for you have found favor with God and Beyond you shall conceive in your and bring forth a Waters and shall call his name who Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom shall be because he doesn't have a beginning then send Mary to the angel how shall this be saying I know what so the woman is questioning God through the angel that you're trying to tell me I'm going to give a pregnancy but how can I have a pregnancy without a man how can a woman have a seed without a man so the woman said means that the woman has a seat that had not that did not originate from a man everybody okay immaculate everybody okay verse 35 and the angel answered and said to her the water Holy Ghost shall do water come over thee and the power of highest salty water therefore also die holy thing the only conception that Holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called The Waters so the seed that Mary conceive was a seed that came from the Holy Ghost it is not a human being that did it open Matthew chapter one glory to God [Music] if you dare you can say Amen Matthew chapter 1 verse 20. you there but why he thought on this thing behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph you son of David feel not to take hope Mary for that which is conceived in here is of the water so who's the father of Jesus Christ Holy Ghost you think the Holy Ghost makes sense people out of their mind and she shall be brought and she shall bring forth a water son and you shall call his name who Jesus for he shall save his people from their sin everybody okay verse uh 23 behold the Virgin shall be with a child and shall have bring forth his son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us watch carefully then Joseph being raised from what sleep did as the angel of the Lord has Biden him and took to him his water why so Joseph was United by God let me continue watch verse 25. and know her in other words Joseph didn't have any sexual relationship with Mary why because the seed is the seed of the water God did not even allow Joseph to touch Mary until the child is born to make sure no man claim anything I think there is a question and an answer right there for young couple I leave it alone I'm not going to touch it everybody okay and no her not nobody asked me that there is a question and there is an answer right there I just saw it and no and no her not until she had brought forth the first song and he called his name who Jesus so the woman the seed of a woman it means that there is no interaction between the man and the woman it's a seed that is completely created by God himself amen that's why the woman shall have a seed how a virgin shall conceal how can a virgin conceive if she will conceive of the Holy Spirit and when she got that conception no man will touch her until the baby is delivered to make sure no man claim anything on my Redemption [Applause] [Music] my Redemption from start to finish belong to God himself [Applause] thank you everybody okay everybody okay now this is the way Jesus Christ was born who in this place was born by a virgin birth none of you that's your difference what is our similarities they gotta be difference and similarities amen let's see our similarities you there where am I at go to Hebrew chapter 2. when I'm at home I think I can do this quickly I said this one 45 minutes I'm done when I get when I get here it's something else amen you there let's go to uh Hebrew chapter 2 verse 9. you dare you can say man amen but we see Jesus who has made a leader lower than water the angels for the suffering of death I'm still good in time according to the way I preach I'm good in time yeah so don't come and say you preacher need to repent it's my time okay but we see Jesus I know how people are they try to shoot anything we see Jesus who was made a little lower than Angel for the suffering of death crown with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should test therefore every man watch carefully for him for he became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons to Glory I'm going to skip some of them to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering let's leave that alone for both he that sanctifies well follow me carefully because husband you must love your wife ask God has loved the water the church and he did what to the church gave himself and did water sanctifier by there of the world to make a bread without and we go and to present to himself so the one that is watching the woman is the one that the woman belong to so he's the one watching the woman making her beautiful and present that same woman to himself and say look at this this is not Flesh of My Flesh one of my bone [Music] I can enter marriage left and right he doesn't worry about himself that's why your wife should look better than you [Music] you cannot have 10 suit and your wife only two skirt did I rob somebody wrong you see the brother looking good and the sister with skirt Jean that the two can split the pant and make a gin together you need to correct that I was a dick on a long time body I heard a lot of stuff let's go back to what we were here everybody okay so so both he that does water Sanctified and this and they who are water one are you catching that are you catching that the one who sanctified and the one who has been sanctified one is clean one is dirty but both of them are one [Applause] [Music] I hope you are shocking this [Applause] Jesus Christ some are sleepy Jesus Christ both leaders Sanctified and they who are Sanctified are all water for this cause he is not ashamed even when you are weak he's not ashamed to be called water so when you coming from he's not ashamed of you [Music] [Applause] people won't want to talk to you but not Jesus Christ because he knows he have the responsibility to clean you up and he does sanctified and the one that has been Sanctified both of them are one [Applause] laughs jump to verse 12. saying I will declare your name to mahu Brethren in the midst of water the church the church is what his body will not sing praise to you and again I will pray I will put my trust in him and again behold I can you read it with me and the water the children which who God me amen you can never separate that's why Paul said one can separate us from there love which is in Hope Christ Jesus [Music] is he suffering is he Angel is he principalities nothing can separate us oh I hope you are getting this Jesus Christ jump to verse 14. Lord help me where am I at e job to verse 14. the Bible says for as much then as the children are partaking of water the flesh because you became human amen he also himself likewise took water all of the same you made my wife human how can I remain a spirit I must be human too I'm gonna follow my wife everybody okay and that through death he might destroy him that had power of what that is who the job to verse 16. for verily he took note on him the nature of water because you were not an angel so he cannot match the angel they are not part of that Redemption amen but he took on the seed of water Abraham that's why he came as a Jew because the promise was given to any to Abraham if the promise was given to America he would come as an American so he have to trust the word and follow the word everybody okay wherefore in all things he be here for him to be made like water his brother in everything I don't know if you're catching that I'm talking about the similarities between you and Jesus Christ in the flesh So In the Flesh the way you are that's exactly how Jesus was if you have had that Jesus have had it all right if you are crying one time for being rejected Jesus understands that very well Jesus Christ that he be made like his water Brethren that he might be how my brother let's go merciful and water faithful High priests in six will turn into water God to make water for the sins of water people so in the body everything he looks like him hey everybody okay what is the difference in the body between you and him because we found out that he participate in flesh and blood you remember and we also by the cross what came water and blood and he also came from with water and blood everybody okay and if you know this Jesus came out of a woman everybody okay everybody okay in the body Jesus Paul says that he became exactly like us amen and in the body Jesus had a mother that took care of him me and you had a mother anybody okay Jesus also had the father of him we also have a father everybody okay Jesus came with water and blood that's what face John said we also came with water and blood amen what is our differences so in the body Jesus is male and female just like Adam amen now we understand now that the creation of Jesus Christ came from a virgin birth the seed of the woman and he came out now we need to find how did the Bride come out and then I might have to learn that I can't reach where I was going amen come on if you notice when we spoke about Adam we found out that Adam never see oh never Adam was not deceived but Adam willfully sinned because he loved his wife let's see how Jesus also was everybody okay if you're tired you say stop we pick up on Sunday then whatever was meant to Sunday we push it another time okay he made his grave with the water Wicked and with the rich in his water because he has done no water violence means there was any water found in his water which of you can convince me of what sin nobody could convince Jesus of sin because Adam nobody could touch him he was original everybody okay John 19 pilate therefore went forth again and said unto them behold I bring him forth to you that he may know that I found water even his enemy could not find the fault against him everybody okay the Bible said and the other answering rebuke him saying does not feel good seeing that out in the same condemnation and we indiciously for we receive the do reward of deed but this man had done what even I mean a thief recognize that Jesus was guiltyless everybody okay glory to God Paul says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our water but with but once in water our points tempted like what we are yet without water because Adam was not deceived let them willfully took the deception and sin to save him everybody okay but with the Precious Blood of who Christ I said lamb without water blemish and water spots first Peter for even here unto where we where you call because Christ also suffered for us leaving us here an example that you should follow his water who did not say neither was water God found in his water mouth I'm reproducing the last Adam everybody okay where are you going brother Branham the misunderstanding was they thought I said that Adam never sinned the one who attacked brother Branham doesn't read this quote just wanna blabber on it but Adam did Sin but he did it with his eyes wide open everybody okay that that they brought Jesus Christ cup he knew what the company he said father take this cup away nevertheless not water but water your will fully everybody okay brother Branham say intimate tree he said that Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the water see if actually thought she was right but Satan did whatever her but he didn't deceive Adam he knew he wasn't wow but because of love for his water why he represented himself with water and was condemned by water the same and cast out of the water and cross-represented himself with the church full of sin and was condemned and he saw one too hell that's why God raised him up on the third day he was not him it was not that he didn't sin he did what he said all right so he has made him to be seen for us who want them you know that we might be made the water righteousness of God in him so Jesus purposely with eyes open like Adam also took your sin upon him because of the love [Applause] everybody okay we talking about the first Adam for his wife now the last Adam with his wife we had similarities but the only difference is he is born without sex we are born with water what does he mean for us let me skip this we already got it amen but upon them say he permits it as I said but he will not he will not let it be his what perfect will but he shall make it work to honor and bless his water and child bearing by sex is what so bringing children by sex is not God perfectly because at the beginning Adam was created from the Dust it is a permissive way brother Branham said this and he showed here in the beginning that his perfect will was to create man out of the water dust of the Earth but you see he permitted to be brought in he never did intend children to be born by what sex but it was water permitted which soon were water fade away my subject today was the byproduct in in top for the last Adam now don't you see the great picture we in water flesh our water different we are like a water by father created by water holy just like Eve was a byproduct on the flesh we okay we also are byproduct in type because of sex that's why he could not fall he could not sin but we are failing because David said in Psalm 51 that we are shaping iniquity everybody okay we are ship born in sins shape in water do you know the scripture Psalm 51 coming into the world doing water speaking love nobody have to teach you that is our byproduct if we were born virgin birth like Jesus Christ none of us were sinned but we are not born by virgin person we are born by the perversion of sex that's why we are doomed to fall by product of the first Adam doomed to Fall by product of the second Adam doomed to fall everybody okay brother Branham say but in what spirit in Genesis 1 26 we are Waters Sons and Daughters not some other Spirit but the spirit of what the water Perfect Image because we become sons and Waters Genesis 1 26 not separated by The Same Spirit the same God the same person Eternal to the Eternal see how God planted that we should be not the different but be him now the body comes from mother and father Genesis 2 7 this is our thy product but the spirit came from who God God separating himself as Adam was what separated everybody okay brother Branham said how can it take how can I take a cockroach and make a grain of wheat out of it it is water impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because he said that has been transmitted from her a Coco bear to a germ called what brother Branham say if you have a genuine 100 of it here 100 inside 100 percent there is no way you can take this and make it a wheat it's not going to happen brother Branham said the only way you can make a cocoa bear a wheat anybody okay when they buy product of the second Adam by sex produce a wrong nature of a crocodile's 100 on the inside of that cocoa bear God will put a witchcraft [Music] out [Applause] he said then you barely die Cracker Barrel if you look you look like a Cocker bear amen and he shall produce a grain of water we because there has been a life of wheat put in there and the life of the cocoa bear has been what taken out but the nature of the cocoa bear on the outside is still water sticky and it will be until this new life has water fully being fully being developed up here again when it comes forth then it is normal 100 water but while it is here on Earth and a Cocker there is still water sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it of water wheat and as long as you are in this life you are going to be and have a water oh no nature that your byproduct that is going to do whatever bother you as long as you but inside of you Genesis 1 26. inside of you you are water born again and when you rise up you are in there likeness of who Christ and all the sin has water God that is the thing everybody okay everybody okay that's why this happened on Sunset Mountain everybody okay brother Brandon said that was taught me on one morning and what time 10 o'clock standing in my room in water told me I will be away yes why are you cockable I will picking up a Cocker bear what do we call there a water why I gotten brother Branham is calling this cocoa bear is very specific this kookaburra is not just any kookaburra but it is a goat head amen because if you look at the goat hair it's a cookie bear that have the head of a goat it looks like this and it's a cockerman that's why they call that a goat head and God taught brother Bradham when you're going to Tucson before I come and bring the blast of this Heavens here you will find on your pet a crocodile that looked like a good everybody okay he said what they call a goat header off of my water then and seven angel came and did what besties and Grand bastard and everything and rolled out the mountain and the Seven Angels did what have a connection between the seven Angel and the cockery everybody okay number one a goat in the Bible represents him that's why Satan is to who uses the head of a goat that's why they came up with acronym calling the greatest of all time they're not saying the greatest of all time they are calling themselves God which is a representative of Lucifer so young people be careful what you're picking up on the internet you find yourself worshiping the devil foreign [Applause] when I'm coming for full Redemption make sure there is a Cocker bear like a goat head it's gonna be sticky to your pants telling you that I'm coming to bring complete Redemption the things that have gone at the church for so long now we don't only have the Redemption of our soul but sooner we're gonna have the changes of our body our body will be changed and the sin on our body will come out and go back to hell that's why you must have a cocoa bear as a representation over there everybody okay everybody okay let's stop here let's stand [Applause] because if I keep moving they sell more here [Music] my God they sell a lot that we need to be delivered amen suck this I have to pick it up again on Sunday there is some more here that you need to get everybody okay everybody okay we are by product in top because we came from the side of him on the cross but when his side was pierced none of you were born the blood came the water came but you were not born yet so in tap you were representative amen so obsess the first Adam wife was a byproduct the second wife of the second Adam must be also by product you become a byproduct by your sexual act that's what brings you a wrong nature that's why Ephesians 2 Say by Nature we were children of Disobedience but the God who is rich in Mercy while we were yet because he was not looking at the Cocker bear inside of you there was a wheat bread while you were yet sinner Christ already looked inside he said that's my song amen I'm not worrying about what is on the outside it is my responsibility to wash her to clean her by the washing of the word so that I can present to myself a church without spot or wrinkle spot is seen wrinkle is the body I need to present a church with a sin on Genesis 1 26 and with a wrinkle on Genesis 2 7. with that spot Genesis 1 26 the Inside Man and with that wrinkle your body needs to become young Genesis 2 7 that's why the angel came down to bring full Redemption so that we receive a message that will change our body that's why marriage cannot happen at the beginning of Paul you have to be happening down and in town let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy father and for helping us tonight despite the fight of the devil lord plainly we can see why the devil was fighting but Lord father we have gained the victory tonight we have won it Lord and you had your word being delivered to your children and this word you spoke in your word that when you send it it is for the healing it will heal it will never return void unto you but everywhere there is a predestinated seed the helping Lord father bury in the Coco bear whether it's in this church or those that will be streaming or streaming elsewhere father that predestinated seed will be quickened by the order of this word oh God we understand now where we're coming from that father we are no other creature but you in the feminine version and Lord father may you take these words that has been preached tonight may you Quicken them may you bring more Revelation so that the people can realize who called them what is the purpose of them being brought in this Center what are you really trying to get when the world is completely in chaos when Lord father the King of the North is Raging where America is Raging where Lord father the world is going to chaos the stock market completely down father the people don't know what is on tomorrow but father you told us to lift up our head because our Redemption and who speak about Redemption is talking about marriage our marriage is drawing thy Lord father just like Rebecca has to be brought from a foreign land and brought back all the way to the land of Isaac and further between Rebecca and Isaac there was a blood relationship they didn't just marry like that that's why Abraham sent him to his own family to make sure they get the one that is bloody related with Isaac and we are also blood related with you that's why you are coming down on this end time to hunt that Brad with the message of eliasm Father hunting the bread where it is to tell her that we are blood related we came from the same father from the same Source from the same Garden even though we have similarities it doesn't matter Redemption has opened up to bring us back to our original position father may you continue to unfold this mystery to your children bring them to a full Consecration and Lord father thank you for helping us tonight may you give them travel mercy and strengthen our body and be with us as we commit everything unto their hand touch those that are sick and struggling in the body with this flu that has been left and right but father we pray that your grace be upon them Lord and may you manifest yourself Lord expressing yourself in your love Lord father by healing your children and bringing those that are out of the fold we humbly ask it Lord father in the name of Jesus Christ
