Okay, before they stand, let me give a little background. So, they've been here for two years &gt;&gt; living in Gastonia and looking for a message church. &gt;&gt; And they live 7 minutes from this church. &gt;&gt; Seven minute &gt;&gt; number seven. And finally the Lord has opened up the way and they found this church and they say we are feeling home. So sister Joanne and brother Roberto and the children just stand so we welcome you in spoken word. God bless you. God bless you. You may be seated. And sister Charlene usually translated originally from Haiti. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So make them feel home, &gt;&gt; feel welcome after service. Push your brake. Don't run to your car.

So, I got Divine here and Divine over there. God bless you. I know you've been here. If I forgot somebody, my apology. God richly bless you. And all new subscribers online. God richly bless you. Numbers keep going up. Welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle. I received a text this morning from a brother, a pastor from overseas in uh in the Republic of Congo, not the Democratic. He been following the sermon. He said, "God bless you for all the teaching and he's asking all the notes. &gt;&gt; I don't even remember. I have to search all the notes. I usually write them by hand." But it's a pastor way. So in other words, somebody's listening to the message far far far away. So welcome to spoken great. God richly bless you and welcome to the channel where the message of William Marion Brham is yummy. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we believe you are all up to date with the sermon you read in your Bible twice a day, your cood church ages, 70 weeks of Daniel, the seals adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour. Amen. Lord's willing, this oncoming Saturday, you heard the announcement. I can't wait to see Sister Joanne. You have uh and make sure you there is no formal invitation or whatever. You already heard it. Just be there on time and let's uh have some good time together. Just sit, chat, worship the Lord and be happy and everything. So, everybody is invited. Brother Roberto and Sister Josianne, you are also invited and welcome there. Amen. Be there on time. So, it's this coming Saturday. You heard the uh the time by brother Robert. And Lord's willing, October the 11th. If you can put that down so you don't forget. October the 11 is our question and answer session. Sometime people ask me the same question. I say every Sunday I repeat this over and over so you can't miss it. October the 11th, it's our question and answer. Then October the 25th is the Youngs Men meeting part three. And Lord's willing on September the 20th, that's the married couple meeting which is part seven which will and December the 13th will be part eight and September the 27 which is will be the young sister meeting. I believe I got everything covered by God's grace. I saw some question uh that were sent online on the YouTube platform. So I'm asking the invisible audience. It's hard for me to go through all the platform YouTube and uh Instagram or Facebook and get all your question. That would be a lot of work for me. So we got a website for the church and there is an email. I usually check my email four times a week. In other word on Monday I check it on Tuesday on Thursday and on uh on Wednesdays and Thursday every time I'm at work I'm checking my email. So if there is any question please take your question send it to the email it will be better for me but it's going to be hard for me if you put something on YouTube for me to go again and begin to search on YouTube and search on Instagram and search on Facebook that's a lot of work for me. So my invisible audience brother use the email. I usually check them weekly and then we can respond accordingly by the grace of God. And if you send me a text internationally or nationally, I have not responded. Please be patient with me. If you look at the number of texts and email and phone call I'm getting, that's a lot. So I'm doing the best that I can by God's grace. Amen. The building project, everything is going well by God's grace. Uh things are moving forward. Brother Michael has been helping a lot. Brother Zach was there yesterday with brother John Porter. Brother Robert I can't even mention. So everything you're doing maybe you might not be here to do the work but your contribution is doing the work and helping us pay the bills. So we still cleaning up the old bills and on the same time we are preparing the money the best that we can to see when we can start the foundation over there. Amen. And you know I I told brother Robert I say this building is a divine building. &gt;&gt; Amen. Usually God gave the plan to one man. &gt;&gt; And he he he can't avoid a lot of headache. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God gave the plan to build the tabernacle to Moses alone. You want me to start preaching on that one? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, you say amen and we move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah. And then God anointed people &gt;&gt; that will support the vision &gt;&gt; that God gave Moses. &gt;&gt; Not to change the vision. &gt;&gt; Your anointing will support the vision. &gt;&gt; Let me push the break there when I'm just going to give a testimony. Can I give a testimony? &gt;&gt; So my time have not started yet. &gt;&gt; So when we were building over there, we put a line for a refrigerator there. And there was a a water line that the the plumber put there so that whenever we buy a refrigerator, they will buy a refrigerator that can make ice and things like that. So So the pipe was already there. So for some reason they close and they bury everything and brother Robert said there is not a problem. There is a way you can locate the pipe and and just borrow a hole and then pull it out. There's no problem. So we were looking for a refrigerator. We look for a refrigerator discussion left and right. So we end up with our humble refrigerator &gt;&gt; and the humble uh I have not even stopped preaching. You begin to act like So we got our humble refrigerator. I know I'm online and I have to say it that way. We got our humble refrigerator which is uh about it was $300 refrigerator &gt;&gt; and it was a very small one, a very humble one. So we got the refrigerator and we put it in. But the problem is that refrigerator doesn't make ice. It's only to cool everything. So we say, you know what? Let's forget it. We can use our bottle, our water bottle. Let's remain humble like message believer and then uh and then uh let's get our refrigerator. So the refrigerator came delivered left there in the box without any problem. So on uh Friday, I believe I was going to buy the blinds for the windows over there. So I got into Home Depot and as I was going to get the blind, the refrigerator and the blind are side by side. &gt;&gt; So I didn't put it there. &gt;&gt; Can I stop or we can continue? &gt;&gt; Can I stop or we can continue? So I went there and as I was passing I saw a yellow signal. &gt;&gt; I look a beautiful refrigerator, &gt;&gt; a huge one. &gt;&gt; And a tall one. &gt;&gt; Can I stop? &gt;&gt; And uh &gt;&gt; I'm looking at your faces. And the price of the refrigerator is $4,500. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Steven, you playing with church money. &gt;&gt; When I look, there was a sign &gt;&gt; and they crossed the price. &gt;&gt; The price. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; And they dropped the price to $1,75. [Applause] &gt;&gt; A huge refrigerator with four doors &gt;&gt; with ice. &gt;&gt; A kitchen egg. Sister Lorela, &gt;&gt; I never even seen the brand before. &gt;&gt; I look I say, my God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And there were other refrigerator, but none of them have a discount like that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, am I dreaming or what? &gt;&gt; This brand is a very expensive brand. &gt;&gt; Everything else, they give a discount of $1,000, $1,200. But this one for some reason they drop it there. &gt;&gt; I took pictures. &gt;&gt; Everybody I say something wrong. &gt;&gt; I send it to brother Robert. &gt;&gt; Brother Robert look said, "Wow, this is nice." I said, "Bro, can you imagine one person will go to the store and buy a refrigerator for $4,000 and somebody else will come and buy the same thing &gt;&gt; for $1,075. But Robert said, "But Stephen, this is the way they do it." I say, "Okay, let me send it to Sister Sharon." &gt;&gt; So I send the picture to Sister Sharon. Sister Sharon say, "Wow, this is God doing the thing." &gt;&gt; I look at the sign, they say, "We don't deliver. You need to pick it up yourself. &gt;&gt; There's no delivery, nothing." I say, "So how can I carry the you can uh you can rent a truck and get it yourself?" &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh my god." say, "You know what? Let me just go home." So, I went home. Then on Saturday, yesterday, I woke up. I said, "Mm." I went, I say, "Sister Sharon, what do you think about that refrigerator?" She said, "This is God." &gt;&gt; I say, "Okay, approval check." I look at her, she was not feeling good. I say, "No problem. I leave. I go myself." So I got into the car and I went to Home Depot. I went there and I saw it but it looks like a refrigerator. I don't see any freezing or anything. Say ah there is no freezing. I called the guy. I said please can I can I talk to somebody here? I need to to learn some information here. So they call somebody they look that man say wow this is a good refrigerator. I need to know myself about it. He's an employee working there. He said we need to call the guy who specialize in refrigerator. So they called the guy. The guy came there. He looked, he said, "No, no, this is a refrigerator when you can uh you can uh adjust the temperature. You can make it a deep freezer or a regular freezer." &gt;&gt; When we open, they say, "Wow." He said, "Man, &gt;&gt; if I needed a refrigerator, I will get this myself." I said, "No, I'm trying to get this for the church." I said, "But you know what? Uh, how can we pick up this refrigerator to the church?" They said, "No, no, no. There is no pickup. You need to rent a truck there." I said, "Rent a truck." Say, "But Stephen, $300 and uh $1,000 minus 300 humble refrigerator." So, I'm looking at maybe $75 to put for a big refrigerator so we can uh put some ice and everything. If you don't feel good in church, you will find some drink. So, I sat down. I looked. &gt;&gt; Sorry. And I was there. I said, "Where is the car?" But they say you go over there at the corner at the customer service you can rent a truck. I went to the customer service. I saw two lady. I say I want to get a refrigerator over there. But can I get a truck? They say there is no truck. All truck are already booked. They are reserved. There is nothing. You have to wait. I say how long should I wait? They say you have to wait. You can leave it seven days. I say I work during the week. There is no way I can do this. I don't want to call brother John Paul there. I'm gonna make him move from there and come all the way here. I know he will do it. If I call brother Glenn, he will pick up his truck and come. I don't want to bother the brother. I said, what can I do? I said, but she said there is nothing. Everything is already booked. Nothing. Be while we were talking an employee came and dropped a key right there in front of both of us. &gt;&gt; Now you know your pastor, you need to seize the opportunity. [Applause] I I look at the lady, I say, "The truck is right there." She said, "No, this one is reserved." I stood there watching her and she dropped and after a while, she raised up. She said, "Can you bring the truck before the evening?" I say, "I just need couple hours." She said, "Go pay for the truck. Go pay for the refrigerator." I run quickly, went there. I saw the man. I say, "Sir, I want to pay for the refrigerator right now because I don't want anything to change there at the company." I say, "I want to pay for it right now." He say, "Okay." He took the the the labor price and put the refrigerator on the computer. When he put the refrigerator on the computer, the price drop. Can I continue? Now the refrigerator is $975. &gt;&gt; The man stopped. He said, "I don't know. The price just dropped." &gt;&gt; He looked and he didn't know I was a minister.

I said, "Don't worry. I will fight with the taxes because it's a church. We got a tax exemption form. We will get the money back. No problem. Just go ahead." I went straight to the lady and she was surprised. I came quickly. She say, "You already paid for it." I say, "I was following your direction. They look they say the truck is right there. They're going to upload everything and you take it yourself. &gt;&gt; I said no problem. Your pastor was in the truck. Brother Michael, you never told me how nice a truck was inside. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Brother Robert was excited. said, I said, "But Robert, I'm driving a truck on Saturday morning. You should see me truck say 20." I said, "How much is a truck?" "$29." So you see a truck moving $29. Your pastor was inside. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I call brother Michael. I said, "Brother Michael, where are you at?" He say, "I'm heading to church."

I said, "Sister Sharon, you missed this. You could have been here enjoying." When I was looking, I took a selfie, not for WhatsApp. I say, "I'm going to take a selfie to show sister Sharon.

Now keep moving. &gt;&gt; Got here in the church with brother Michael, brother John Porter, brother Zach. We put it. It's over there. Beautiful. We left it there. I took the humble refrigerator.

Because I was driving a truck. Now I'm delivering stuff. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I took the truck. I took the refrigerator back. I gave it to them. They reimbured the money. I dropped everything. And before I went there, I stopped at my office. Pick up some business card. &gt;&gt; And I went back and I followed the man and I gave them a card. He looked at me. He said, "You a man of your word." &gt;&gt; I say, "Thank you very much, brother." Left, got in the car and moved forward. So if you go back there and you see a 4,000 4,500 refrigerator, please the seven seal. Hush. &gt;&gt; Are we together?

We are happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will fellowship but we are happy when &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's pray. Heavenly father, Lord, we approaching you humbly this morning. Father, we thank you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability that you have given me. When it comes to speaking to your children to bless your bride, you only take the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit. Lord, may you move me completely out of the way. May you come and speak to our soul and bless us, Lord, in a supernatural way. Remove the devil away from here. And father, touch those that are sick in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will pick up where we stopped last Sunday. &gt;&gt; Because we preached something else. So hopefully we will preach. Our team this morning, you can go to Genesis 14. Our theme this morning is a tree. Amen. &gt;&gt; A tree and season. Each of season two deepest. &gt;&gt; I was made for more. &gt;&gt; You heard all those things were put together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Genesis 14. If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we are studying the reading of the Bible. &gt;&gt; When we finish the reading of the Bible, you turn 45 minutes and then we go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse uh 16. The Bible says in verse 16, "And he Abraham brought back all the goods." You understand this from last Sunday? I hope everybody is up to date. and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods and and the women also and the people. You understand all of this? I'm moving forward. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Verse 17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of who? You read that that name. &gt;&gt; Cheddar Lammer. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Cheddar. and and of the kings that were with him at the valley of Chave, which is the king's dale. Verse 18, and Melkisedc, remember last Sunday as the king of Sodom was going to meet Abraham, Melkisedc came first. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He preceded that. Glory to God. Amen. He says, "And Mechisedc, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, and he was the priest of the most high God." Remember, he was not just a priest, he was also a king. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, what we want to put here first is Mechisedc brought to Abraham communion. &gt;&gt; You understand this? &gt;&gt; Communion or fellowship. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were unable to get this. Put your seat belt. We would take off from the airport soon. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And he meched just didn't give him communion, but he blessed him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He blessed him. Let me give you my title here. Mat this morning before we forgot is our life journey through Joseph 5 garment part 75. [Laughter] Uh remember we still on the p for D and pif for basement there. I don't know when we going to come out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says and Mechisedc blessed him. You can refocus and say blessed be Abraham of the most high God possessor of heaven and earth. God met Abraham as a possessor of heaven and earth. When God meet you under a name, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It means that you are lacking what that name is actually bringing. &gt;&gt; Yes, exactly. &gt;&gt; We already understand that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham say Abraham was poor. &gt;&gt; Yes, he was. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No wonder I was trying to skip this, but let's go ahead. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say in the message, what? &gt;&gt; Possessing off. &gt;&gt; Possessing off. Look at the title of the message. possessing what? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; He said, now in Genesis, we read of Abraham meeting this great man called Mechisedc &gt;&gt; who was possessor of what? &gt;&gt; Both heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; And then he was possessor of what? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; Possessor of heaven and earth. That is of water. &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; So possessor of heaven and earth means he possess all things. We understand this. Then brother Brham described to us in the same message the state of Abraham when Mechisedc met him. Brother Brham say that now down here because you remember this we understand that Abraham was the poorest man in all the country. &gt;&gt; He was not the poor man. &gt;&gt; He was the poorest. In other words, if you search the whole country, Abraham was at the bottom. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He was the poorest man of all the country. In all the country because he live out where? &gt;&gt; In the desert. &gt;&gt; And he live in peace with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though he was poor, but he was he had peace with God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God was already Jehovah shalom for him. Yes, sir. He was lacking things but he was in peace. &gt;&gt; So peace doesn't depend on material. &gt;&gt; Peace is a person. &gt;&gt; He is Jehovah shalom. &gt;&gt; You might be lacking things. You might not have the money to pay the bills, but you can be at peace. &gt;&gt; You are at peace because the peaceful God is there &gt;&gt; and everything is under control. Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I'm continuing that same message. He say Abraham could lay hold on to &gt;&gt; yet how poor &gt;&gt; his cattle was starving. &gt;&gt; Lord took the best ground. His water was water &gt;&gt; short. &gt;&gt; How many what kind of days? &gt;&gt; Hot days. &gt;&gt; And the herdsman has been watered &gt;&gt; in trouble. &gt;&gt; And everything looked like gone wrong for Abraham. Yet he own what? &gt;&gt; The whole thing. &gt;&gt; In other words, what is going on in your life right now doesn't tell what you going to be. &gt;&gt; Your situation right now is not your destiny. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So Gabbraham when he met God under the name of Elle Leon &gt;&gt; under the name of Melkisedc we found out that the first description is Abraham was the poorest &gt;&gt; that's why God met him as Elle Leon &gt;&gt; as the one who possessed everything &gt;&gt; and God took that anointing &gt;&gt; of possessing everything &gt;&gt; and begin to put that anointing on Abraham &gt;&gt; are Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. Praise God. Verse uh uh 19. He said, "And he blessed him and say, blessed be Abraham of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth, possessor of all things, and blessed be the most high God which has done what? &gt;&gt; Delivered thine enemies &gt;&gt; into your hand." So we understand the one who fought the battle is God through Abraham. who deliver your enemy into your hand. And he gave him the ts of water. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Preach on that one." And the king of Sodom said to Abraham, after Mechisedc gave him the communion. And after Mechisedc already bless him, he told Abraham, he said, "Give me the person." Brother Brandham say he was asking for his subject. In other words, he want to rebuild his kingdom back up again. He said, "Give me the person and take the goods to yourself." In other words, take the salary. &gt;&gt; And Abraham said to the king of Sodom, "I have done what? &gt;&gt; Lift up mine hand unto the Lord." &gt;&gt; And the mo which what type of Lord? &gt;&gt; The most high God. &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham now is vowing. &gt;&gt; He's telling the king of Sodom that I'm already committed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm already hooked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You came too late. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am committed to the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take what &gt;&gt; from a thread. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Even what? &gt;&gt; To a shoe latch. &gt;&gt; And that I would not take anything that is yours, lest you should say that I have made Abraham how? &gt;&gt; Rich. &gt;&gt; So we find that even though Abraham was poor &gt;&gt; when the opportunity was given to him, Abraham rejected the opportunity from Sodom &gt;&gt; waiting on the opportunity that was already given to him by the blessing of Elon. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brham was able to return a 1 million check. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand me. They brought a million dollar check to brother Brham. And they brought you brother Brandham because he did the service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like Abraham did the service. &gt;&gt; When they brought the million dollar, brother Brandham return the check back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you have to depend on God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the condition of Abraham were not good. &gt;&gt; He was struggling. &gt;&gt; Yes, he was. &gt;&gt; Hard days, &gt;&gt; trouble everywhere. Yes. &gt;&gt; Seems like everything is not working. &gt;&gt; Yet he's possessing everything. &gt;&gt; And Paul, we saw last Sunday that Paul says in 2 Corinthians 6:10, he says as what? &gt;&gt; Sorrowful &gt;&gt; yet always what? &gt;&gt; Rejoicing. &gt;&gt; The sorrow is external. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what &gt;&gt; I'm trying to leave the airport. Amen. There is an external environment &gt;&gt; and there is an internal environment &gt;&gt; on the outside. It's sorrowful &gt;&gt; but it's not sorrowful on the inside. &gt;&gt; On the outside things are not working but Abraham was at peace with God. &gt;&gt; The outside was sorrowful but Paul is saying always doing what? &gt;&gt; Rejoicing. So this joy doesn't depend on the wedding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me my friend. &gt;&gt; It is a joy that doesn't repend depend on what is going on outside. &gt;&gt; It is a joy that is coming from within. &gt;&gt; Whether things are good or bad, it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Keep in mind it's a joy that is coming from with inside [Applause] &gt;&gt; because if he was depending on the outside then whenever the outside goes up you rejoice. When it goes down your face change in church. &gt;&gt; Amen. We see you in church happy. Next Sunday we see you. You sorrowful. &gt;&gt; You have an outside joy. The inside joy is a joy where no one can tell when you going through trouble. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even your enemy is trouble because your enemy wants you to be sorrowful but he cannot see sorrow in your life. The devil want you sad. &gt;&gt; But if you you are rejoicing, you are actually troubling the devil &gt;&gt; because despite everything that the devil is doing, you still moving on. &gt;&gt; That is something that you don't manufacture, &gt;&gt; it is something that is coming from within. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul says that yet always doing what? rejoicing &gt;&gt; as how &gt;&gt; poor &gt;&gt; yet making what? &gt;&gt; Many rich. &gt;&gt; Paul is saying that if you look at him &gt;&gt; like Abraham, Paul is poor [Music] &gt;&gt; yet &gt;&gt; he makes other how &gt;&gt; rich. &gt;&gt; The ability to be poor &gt;&gt; on the outside. the ability to be poor on the outside &gt;&gt; and make other people rich. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Means that wealth is on the inside. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can you put your seat belt &gt;&gt; now? You slowing me down. [Music] Are we together? &gt;&gt; The Bible described Jesus Christ in Isaiah 53. &gt;&gt; If you look at him, nothing, no beauty to behold. &gt;&gt; But inside that man was healing. &gt;&gt; Inside that man was bread. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Not bread, but cooked bread. &gt;&gt; Inside that man were fishes. &gt;&gt; Not fishes, but cook. season fry fish. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; If you look at Jesus, Jesus didn't have fish. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't have fish. The one who had fish was a little boy. But Jesus could take the fish and make the Ludo rich &gt;&gt; until they were overflow. &gt;&gt; So where was the fish Jesus was creating? Where were dead? In other words, the ability &gt;&gt; to be poor, &gt;&gt; to be lacking, &gt;&gt; yet you are making somebody rich. &gt;&gt; It's an ability that that belongs to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know you trying to struggle with it. I'm going to make it as plan because your pastor is direct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ability &gt;&gt; to be poor &gt;&gt; and make somebody else rich, &gt;&gt; it's a divine attribute. &gt;&gt; It is a characteristic of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Only God is poor and make somebody rich. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And Paul is saying here, not God. Paul &gt;&gt; is the one who is poor &gt;&gt; making other people what? &gt;&gt; Rich. &gt;&gt; I know you struggling. &gt;&gt; Let's let's nail this thing &gt;&gt; as what? &gt;&gt; Poor &gt;&gt; yet making many what &gt;&gt; rich. &gt;&gt; Not making one person &gt;&gt; making what? &gt;&gt; Many. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; In other words, don't look at your present state. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't wait to be rich to bless somebody. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; Don't wait to be healed &gt;&gt; before you can pray for somebody. Even if you heal, you can still pray for others and God will heal others. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't understand. Let's Let's look at this a little bit. Amen. We usually say, "I'm myself sick. How can I pray for somebody? You don't understand who you are. Wow. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why the Pharisee told Jesus Christ, "If you are the cross at the cross, &gt;&gt; do what? &gt;&gt; Come down." &gt;&gt; Did Jesus come down? &gt;&gt; Jesus was at the cross, but he's giving eternal life to the thief. &gt;&gt; And him and the thief are on the same condition. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. Jesus crucified &gt;&gt; the fifth crucified &gt;&gt; but Jesus being crucified doesn't bother him &gt;&gt; as being crucified he can still give life &gt;&gt; his condition Jesus didn't say you see how I'm suffering at the cross I cannot save anyone now &gt;&gt; no Jesus his name means yeshua &gt;&gt; he was a savior &gt;&gt; he cannot help but save [Applause] He want salvation. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Even though he's going through the same condition, &gt;&gt; but he's going he turn around. He say you &gt;&gt; in paradise with me today. &gt;&gt; Lord help me &gt;&gt; as being what? &gt;&gt; Poor &gt;&gt; yet what &gt;&gt; making many rich. &gt;&gt; So let me help you. to you who are struggling. Paul says in 2 Corinthian what? &gt;&gt; Eight &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Nine. &gt;&gt; For ye know, ye know what? &gt;&gt; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that though he was &gt;&gt; rich. &gt;&gt; This is Jesus, not you. &gt;&gt; Though he was how? &gt;&gt; Rich, &gt;&gt; yet for your sake he became what? &gt;&gt; Poor. &gt;&gt; That ye through his poverty might be what? &gt;&gt; Rich. [Applause] Now fight with this. &gt;&gt; The ability to become poor &gt;&gt; and making other rich is an ability of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus became what? &gt;&gt; Poor. &gt;&gt; And making other what? &gt;&gt; Rich. &gt;&gt; And Paul is saying now it's no longer Jesus Christ. new now. &gt;&gt; Being poor, &gt;&gt; making other sess [Applause] &gt;&gt; there are people whose company have been blessed because of you working there. I know you won't believe that &gt;&gt; because you living paycheck by paycheck. &gt;&gt; But the employee know [Applause] &gt;&gt; that since this boy came &gt;&gt; Joseph was poor. &gt;&gt; Joseph was a slave but his presence was making body far rich. [Applause] I don't know if you understanding me. &gt;&gt; And brother Braham said he was the son of prosperity. &gt;&gt; In other words, don't look at yourself. &gt;&gt; Look inside yourself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Joseph is coming. A slave. They bringing a slave. They're bringing a slave. Did you see any wealth with him? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But when they put him in the house, they give him responsibility. The blessing of Joseph &gt;&gt; begin to affect Pifer. &gt;&gt; Poor making podify rich. &gt;&gt; It is an ability of people who are God. [Applause] Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus himself was rich. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he became poor to make other what [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you here. Whatever mechisedc is [Applause] &gt;&gt; this is what you are. &gt;&gt; Mechisedc. Mechisedc is priest &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; The Bible say ye are what? &gt;&gt; So what is the difference between you and mecisedc is possessor of all things? &gt;&gt; You must be what? &gt;&gt; That's why Paul is saying and yet doing what? &gt;&gt; Possessing all things. &gt;&gt; In other word you are divine. She say divine never take your name for joke. &gt;&gt; No sir, &gt;&gt; you are divine. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The husband that marry you marry a divine wife. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? [Music] H what I'm trying to show you is clear and simple. &gt;&gt; Paul is saying joyful. He say as poor and yet making other water rich. &gt;&gt; In other word this quality, this characteristic is a characteristic of sons of God. &gt;&gt; And sons of God are God. &gt;&gt; It is only God that can do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have the ability to make somebody wealthy, &gt;&gt; rich, where is the wealth? &gt;&gt; We are we are studying our sermon slowly. Where is the health? &gt;&gt; Let's continue. My friend Paul says as having what? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; And yet possessing what? &gt;&gt; All things. In other words, when you look at that person at Abraham, Abraham look like having nothing. &gt;&gt; But be careful. &gt;&gt; Abraham possess what? [Applause] &gt;&gt; So being poor on the outside doesn't mean you poor inside. [Applause] Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The anointing of God changed the wilderness &gt;&gt; into a place where grass can grow. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus will do in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because every every wilderness must be changed. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the one entering there is life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's continue, my friend. Slowly look at this. When I say having nothing &gt;&gt; and yet possessing all things, &gt;&gt; listen to what God does. &gt;&gt; Paul says in 2 Corinthian, Paul says in first uh Peter say in 2 Peter 1:3, he say according as what? &gt;&gt; His divine power, &gt;&gt; which power? &gt;&gt; Divine power has given unto us what? &gt;&gt; All things.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So his divine power give us what? &gt;&gt; And that's why Paul is saying as long as that divine power is there. &gt;&gt; Even though you look like you don't have anything, &gt;&gt; just know you already have everything. &gt;&gt; Even though Abraham looked poor, &gt;&gt; be careful. The blessing of Elleon, &gt;&gt; that's what he needed &gt;&gt; to possess everything. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; let's go to Genesis 15. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember something. Remember, look at this. &gt;&gt; Yes. We found out that when Abraham met Melkisedc, &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't have children. &gt;&gt; We know that, right? &gt;&gt; We know that, right? &gt;&gt; Then Paul goes to back to the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; And Paul look at Abraham and &gt;&gt; MelkiseDC. &gt;&gt; And when Paul begin to watch the movie, &gt;&gt; That's right. of Abraham and &gt;&gt; MelkiseDC. &gt;&gt; Paul put some software &gt;&gt; that allow him to see below the screen. You remember that &gt;&gt; when Paul look below the screen Paul begin to say that hey &gt;&gt; externally Abraham didn't have children &gt;&gt; the first aspect is poverty you understand that &gt;&gt; the second aset is aspect he was childless &gt;&gt; exteriorly &gt;&gt; hallelujah Are we together? &gt;&gt; So when Paul look he said uh &gt;&gt; Abraham had children &gt;&gt; he said leave &gt;&gt; not Isaac Leah &gt;&gt; was where &gt;&gt; and the sons of liver &gt;&gt; plural &gt;&gt; und delivered. Abraham &gt;&gt; where where &gt;&gt; in Abra. &gt;&gt; So Abra so when Paul look he said hey &gt;&gt; this man has so many children. &gt;&gt; Follow me. Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Let you use you brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; the children were where? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We found out that &gt;&gt; Abraham begat who? &gt;&gt; Isaac. Isaac begat who? &gt;&gt; Jacob. &gt;&gt; And Jacob begat who? &gt;&gt; And Leah the son of Levah. &gt;&gt; So we find the sons of Leah were where? &gt;&gt; Lev was where? &gt;&gt; Jacob must be where? &gt;&gt; Isaac must be where? &gt;&gt; So the whole nation of Israel was where? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; I have a news for you. You want to hear that news? &gt;&gt; You want to hear that news? &gt;&gt; Ishmael also &gt;&gt; I'm going to go somewhere. &gt;&gt; Was also inside. &gt;&gt; So Abraham had two type of children. [Music] &gt;&gt; Church, I'm trying to move. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to move. Abraham has two type of children. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put it here &gt;&gt; and I let brother man the Bible tell us the type of children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go first to Genesis 15. &gt;&gt; We are reading the Bible. Verse one. Let's go. My friend &gt;&gt; after these things. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. The word of the Lord came to who? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; And uh in a vision. Continue, my friend. &gt;&gt; Saying fear not. &gt;&gt; I am thy shield. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. and thy exceeding great reward. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And Abram said, &gt;&gt; Lord God, &gt;&gt; what will thou give me? &gt;&gt; Seeing I go childless. &gt;&gt; See, I go how? &gt;&gt; Childless. &gt;&gt; So Abraham thought he was how? &gt;&gt; Childless. &gt;&gt; But Paul is saying what was in Abraham? &gt;&gt; Sons of Levi. &gt;&gt; Not only sons of Levah, &gt;&gt; Levi. &gt;&gt; Levi himself. All Israel was right there. &gt;&gt; But Abraham is saying I'm what? child. &gt;&gt; So exteriorally, &gt;&gt; Abraham is childless. &gt;&gt; Yet on the inside, &gt;&gt; remember, I'm going to get to a tree. &gt;&gt; Abraham has swept many things. &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; And then go ahead. &gt;&gt; And the steward of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus. &gt;&gt; So, so where was Abraham looking at? &gt;&gt; On the inside or outside? &gt;&gt; Outside. &gt;&gt; You see many times we looking at our life on the outside. Take your time, brother. &gt;&gt; And then we begin to designate thing. I believe uh I see Elza is a good man. He's very faithful. He he's he's consecrated and everything. I believe Eleazar of Damascus is the one that's going to be my &gt;&gt; Abraham is looking with the eyes, &gt;&gt; but he's not looking with the eyes. &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's go my friend. And Abraham said, "Behold to me you have given what?" &gt;&gt; No seed. &gt;&gt; Are you sure, Abraham? &gt;&gt; Amen. And lo, one born &gt;&gt; in my house. &gt;&gt; Will be what? &gt;&gt; Is my air. &gt;&gt; In other words, the heir is who? Eleaz. Because he's born in a child. So this is the air. &gt;&gt; Verse four. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him saying, What? &gt;&gt; This shall not be thine air. Ah, not Eleazar but water. &gt;&gt; He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. God is saying the air of Abraham will come forth from where? &gt;&gt; From what? &gt;&gt; Can you can you repeat what the Bible say? The air will come from whose bowel? &gt;&gt; Abraham's bowel. &gt;&gt; So if the air is coming from the bower, where was the air? In other words, God is telling Abraham inside of you, &gt;&gt; you already got children. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; God is repeating to Abraham, listen inside of you, you already got children. &gt;&gt; He's saying, I'm say, change your confession. &gt;&gt; That's why God has to change his name &gt;&gt; based on what was inside. I'm going to get there. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get there. &gt;&gt; So, we found out that the children of Abraham, &gt;&gt; the children of Abraham were inside &gt;&gt; in his own power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But his confession is childless. &gt;&gt; Abraham childless. &gt;&gt; Abraham childless. &gt;&gt; And you're going to see why God have to change. his name. &gt;&gt; Nations are already inside here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No problem. Job to verse uh five. &gt;&gt; And he brought him forth what? &gt;&gt; Abroad. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And said, &gt;&gt; "Look now toward heaven." &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And tell the stars &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; If thou be able to number them, &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And he said unto him, Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; so shall thy seed be. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And he believed in the Lord &gt;&gt; and so shall that seed be. &gt;&gt; And then he believed in the water &gt;&gt; and he was counted to him from water &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; So God told Abraham your seed is inside of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And maybe Abraham thought maybe so my children are here. Huh. So maybe since me and Sarah discussed that we will have five. So Sarah wanted two boys and then three girls. So I believe I got five children. God said before Abraham begin to bring the discussion with Sarah Abraham I am going to give you the number of children in you come outside &gt;&gt; I don't want your number come outside &gt;&gt; do you follow me &gt;&gt; come outside he said look at the star &gt;&gt; go ahead and number them &gt;&gt; say who can do that he said you see how you cannot number &gt;&gt; inside of you &gt;&gt; the unlimited number that's what is inside of you. &gt;&gt; I hope you understanding. &gt;&gt; So in Abraham &gt;&gt; there was unlimited number &gt;&gt; unlimited number of children yet naturally speaking. You don't see anything. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's go now to Genesis 16. We're moving very good, my friend. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're moving very good. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 16. When I say moving very good, keep moving very good. Let's go to verse one. &gt;&gt; And Sarah, Abraham's wife, bore him water, &gt;&gt; no children. And she had a handmade. &gt;&gt; Now, because of the time, remember God already show Abraham that his children are well. The problem is if they are inside, why are they not coming out? &gt;&gt; The problem is the season. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can you please help me up? It's already there, &gt;&gt; but it doesn't come out like that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because of that, Sarah begin to say, "Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; You told me God told you you got two too many children like the star of the heaven. Me, I don't see anything. &gt;&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt; now. Sarah bring the pressure &gt;&gt; and the pressure against the word of God." &gt;&gt; Let's let let's move on closely. Why? Because what God say does not appear yet. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Abraham expressed his desire to God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, yes, but you bless me as Leon. I understand. &gt;&gt; But I don't have a baby. &gt;&gt; Is this one the one I'm going to get?" God answer his prayer. &gt;&gt; And God say, "Listen, in you they are children." &gt;&gt; In other words, that should finish the problem right here. right there. &gt;&gt; Are we do are you with me? &gt;&gt; But because of the timing, &gt;&gt; the pressure begin to come. &gt;&gt; Sarah could not stand &gt;&gt; waiting again too long. &gt;&gt; Now Sarah open up an alternative. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It's going to drop like a bomb, my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? When Sarah opened an alternative, sir, &gt;&gt; remember my friend, follow me. &gt;&gt; Yes, we are. &gt;&gt; When the promised son came, &gt;&gt; what was his name? &gt;&gt; His name was Isaac. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; When Sarah changed the game, &gt;&gt; God took the bullet of Isaac &gt;&gt; and move it down. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And pulled the bullet of Ishmael &gt;&gt; and pull it up. Remember Ishmael was there &gt;&gt; I'm going to say something &gt;&gt; and Isaac was there and Levi was there. &gt;&gt; But when Sarah begin to doubt the promise &gt;&gt; the other womb of Abraham open up &gt;&gt; not the promised womb. There it is. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you time to soak this in. &gt;&gt; I'm on the bumpy place, my friend. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody alive. &gt;&gt; Everybody alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, get this. I'm going to drop it. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Verse uh one. Don't worry. I'm going to give you scripture. I'm going to nail it. &gt;&gt; You know your pastor. &gt;&gt; Verse one. Now Sarah Abraham's wife did water &gt;&gt; bear him no children &gt;&gt; bore him water &gt;&gt; no children &gt;&gt; and she had a water &gt;&gt; and handmade &gt;&gt; was that a promise of God &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; continue and a what &gt;&gt; an Egyptian &gt;&gt; so he went into getting a word living &gt;&gt; that's exactly right &gt;&gt; that was living in the church [Applause] &gt;&gt; that's it So Egypt was lingering a little bit somewhere there &gt;&gt; in the house. &gt;&gt; And because Egypt was lingering in the house, &gt;&gt; that was a doll the devil use. &gt;&gt; Whatever weaknesses that you still playing around with it &gt;&gt; in your life, &gt;&gt; that's where the devil will punch you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Then he went to the Egyptian. Let's go. The Egyptian whose name was who? &gt;&gt; Hagar. &gt;&gt; And Sarah said to Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord has what? &gt;&gt; Restrained me from bearing." &gt;&gt; I pray you go into my water &gt;&gt; and it may be that I may obtain what? &gt;&gt; Children by her. &gt;&gt; How can another woman have a child and then you call that child your child? &gt;&gt; You see certain things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And then that I may obtain children by her." And Abraham did what? &gt;&gt; Hearken to the voice of Sarah. &gt;&gt; And Sarah, Abraham, wife, took who? &gt;&gt; Hagar. &gt;&gt; So who took Hagar? &gt;&gt; Sarah. &gt;&gt; So who brought Aar to the bedroom? &gt;&gt; Sarah. &gt;&gt; Sarah. &gt;&gt; Mama. Sarah. &gt;&gt; What is going on? I a I figure a plan. &gt;&gt; I figure a plan. &gt;&gt; I believe in this message it doesn't happen. So, let me take you somewhere first &gt;&gt; because it's taking too long in the church. &gt;&gt; Let's go a little bit outside &gt;&gt; so we can get it from outside. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to drop it. I don't have any choice. &gt;&gt; Abraham has two type of children. &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; Abraham have the children by promise. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And Abraham have children by flesh. &gt;&gt; Let me drop it because somebody is resisting. Brother Brham says in the exposition of the seven churches in the Ephesian churches, he says, "Then we see a what? &gt;&gt; A perfect picture &gt;&gt; in Abraham's sons of what? &gt;&gt; The flesh. &gt;&gt; His name is what? &gt;&gt; Ishmael." So Ismael was not a son of the promise. &gt;&gt; He was a son of what? &gt;&gt; The flesh. &gt;&gt; So when you are following your flesh, [Applause] &gt;&gt; you will produce Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go slowly, my friend. &gt;&gt; He says, "The sons of the flesh." Who? &gt;&gt; Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Who did what? &gt;&gt; Who teased and fought the son of the promise? &gt;&gt; Who's what? &gt;&gt; Isaac. So we got sons of what? &gt;&gt; The flesh &gt;&gt; and sons of what? &gt;&gt; The promise. &gt;&gt; Where did brother get that? In a Galatian 4:23. But he who was born of what? &gt;&gt; The bond woman &gt;&gt; was born how? &gt;&gt; After the flesh. &gt;&gt; But he of a free woman was born by what? &gt;&gt; Promise. &gt;&gt; So in Abraham there was two type of children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Children by promise &gt;&gt; and children by flesh. &gt;&gt; But when you reject the word of God, There is &gt;&gt; your delivery change. &gt;&gt; Instead of picking up Isaac, &gt;&gt; the delivery change and went and pick up Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. &gt;&gt; The first son that should come from from Abraham is &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; And Isaac come by promise. But because Sarah doubt, &gt;&gt; God cannot bring Isaac. &gt;&gt; With a doubt, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; God say what is going on there is doubt. &gt;&gt; Doubt. Isaac doesn't come with doubt. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; The one who come with doubt &gt;&gt; is Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Beautiful brother. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's look at Ishmael before I move on. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse four. And he went into what? &gt;&gt; Hagar. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And she conceived. &gt;&gt; Ah. And when she saw that water, &gt;&gt; she had conceived. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Her mistress was what? &gt;&gt; Despised in her eyes. &gt;&gt; This home was peaceful. Everything in this house was going fine &gt;&gt; until Sarah deviated. &gt;&gt; Now trouble happen. &gt;&gt; Trouble entering the house. &gt;&gt; We cause our own problem. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are understanding why. How do we cause our own problem? by doing things that are against the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let me help you up again. I know I'm going to drive. I'm It's a little bit bumpy. Drop to verse 11. Father, help me. And the angel of the Lord, who is the angel of the Lord? &gt;&gt; God himself. The angel of the Lord said to her, to Hagar, &gt;&gt; Behold, you are water &gt;&gt; with child &gt;&gt; and shall bear a water, &gt;&gt; a son. &gt;&gt; And you shall call his name water, &gt;&gt; Ishmael, &gt;&gt; because the Lord has heard your affliction, &gt;&gt; and he will be a good man. &gt;&gt; No, a &gt;&gt; he will be a what? &gt;&gt; A wild man. &gt;&gt; So Sarah produce what? &gt;&gt; A wild man. &gt;&gt; The blessing of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible say it is the blessing of the Lord. Huh? &gt;&gt; That make you what? &gt;&gt; That make you rich. And added what? &gt;&gt; When Isaac come, Isaac will not bring sorrow. &gt;&gt; But when is my come &gt;&gt; because you did think contrary to the word. Ishmael will bring sorrow. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And I know I mean I'm I'm in a difficulty zone, but we going to pass. &gt;&gt; He say he will be a what? &gt;&gt; A wild man. His hand will be against what? &gt;&gt; Every man. &gt;&gt; Some man. &gt;&gt; No wonder he was fighting Isaac. &gt;&gt; His hand is against who? &gt;&gt; Every man. &gt;&gt; And every man hands against what? &gt;&gt; Him. &gt;&gt; He shall dwell in the presence of what? &gt;&gt; All his brethren. &gt;&gt; So going against the will of God produce an Ishmael. &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to say is this. Follow me my friend. inside of Abraham. His children were there, &gt;&gt; but they were negative children &gt;&gt; of the flesh &gt;&gt; and they were positive children of the promise. &gt;&gt; What are you trying to say to us, Pastor Steven? What I'm trying to say is this. Your flesh have desires [Applause] &gt;&gt; that are contrary to the word of God. And if you follow your flesh, &gt;&gt; you will produce Ismael. &gt;&gt; That is not Godgiven promises. &gt;&gt; But if you wait on the Lord &gt;&gt; at the right season, &gt;&gt; Isaac will come out. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Father, help me up. &gt;&gt; In your flesh, you got your soul. &gt;&gt; You got your body. And you got your spirit. &gt;&gt; Your spirit operate your body. &gt;&gt; And your body is not under redemption yet. &gt;&gt; That's why we are struggling in the body. &gt;&gt; So you got children in the body. &gt;&gt; But you got also children in the soul. &gt;&gt; What is in the soul is towards your promise. &gt;&gt; But what is in your body is based on what your eyes can see. So if you begin to lean more on the sight &gt;&gt; than faith, &gt;&gt; just be prepared to receive Ishmael. &gt;&gt; In other words, there are things that we did before season. &gt;&gt; Because we were going through pressure. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God already heard you. &gt;&gt; God already gave you what you needed. But he must come at the a certain time. &gt;&gt; But when you push too hard &gt;&gt; according to the lust of your flesh, &gt;&gt; you will open another son who is Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every sister here, every brother here that is not married got a promise to be married. and your marriage have a date &gt;&gt; and your husband have his time. &gt;&gt; But if you don't understand and you push &gt;&gt; and you begin to go contrary to the word of God, you going to get an Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Remember you are produce a wild husband. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can make it look like yours. But it's not yours. &gt;&gt; Bring me bring me the baby. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Sarah, you got a baby? Yes, I got a baby now. &gt;&gt; But you are old with a baby. It doesn't make sense. &gt;&gt; The baby is for Hega. You took somebody else husband. &gt;&gt; You going to marry the wrong man. &gt;&gt; Because you want to go outside the word. &gt;&gt; When you go outside the word, God pull Isaac back &gt;&gt; and he lord Ishmael. &gt;&gt; So you will learn the hard way. [Applause] You want a husband, get your husband in the message. &gt;&gt; You want a wife, get your wife in the message. If you deviate from that, God will give you one. An Ishmael. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. Well, &gt;&gt; if you marry against the word of God, &gt;&gt; prepare for an Ishmael marriage. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm I'm I'm already off the bumpy road. &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet say. &gt;&gt; He said, but God does what? &gt;&gt; Keeps his promise. &gt;&gt; No matter how unreasonable it may seems, &gt;&gt; God is obligated to what? &gt;&gt; His promise. Sarah thought, &gt;&gt; are you following me? &gt;&gt; Sarah thought that maybe he could what? &gt;&gt; Have Hagar &gt;&gt; or who? &gt;&gt; Rather &gt;&gt; rather he her what? &gt;&gt; Her maid &gt;&gt; to give birth to a baby through what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; And she will do what? &gt;&gt; Take it. &gt;&gt; And that became what? &gt;&gt; Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Which was a what? &gt;&gt; A thorn in the flesh. &gt;&gt; We create our own problem &gt;&gt; because we don't want to wait on the Lord. Because we are moving before the season. &gt;&gt; Then you're going to create an Ishmael &gt;&gt; because Lord, I have been waiting too long. I don't have it. Let me try this one. Ishmael. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Isaac will only be loaded &gt;&gt; when it's Sarah. &gt;&gt; When God look at Sarah, he say pull Isaac. &gt;&gt; Who is not Isaac? &gt;&gt; Bring the wild men. &gt;&gt; Get it? bring the wives husband. &gt;&gt; You will pray so long. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "And he became what?" &gt;&gt; Ishmael, which was what? &gt;&gt; Adorn in the flesh &gt;&gt; from until what? &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; so the sorrow didn't stop with Sarah. &gt;&gt; Even today, Israel is suffering. Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother, whatever you trying to do &gt;&gt; against this message, &gt;&gt; don't worry. &gt;&gt; It's just a matter of time. &gt;&gt; When the baby's born, you will be happy. &gt;&gt; Give it some time. &gt;&gt; Look at the characteristic. &gt;&gt; You will reap an Ishmael. He says &gt;&gt; still a what? &gt;&gt; A thorn in the flesh. &gt;&gt; For out of there came what? &gt;&gt; The Arabs. &gt;&gt; Still today. &gt;&gt; They cannot bring the Arab &gt;&gt; in peace with Israel. &gt;&gt; The jihad soul. They have to wipe Israel. &gt;&gt; Israel is suffering today because of Sarah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Watch the decision you taking. Daddy, watch your decision. Mommy, watch your decision. You can make the whole family suffer. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; If you don't say amen, that's okay with me. &gt;&gt; Brother, brother say, and they are always been how &gt;&gt; that way. &gt;&gt; Now, anytime. &gt;&gt; You ready? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That what &gt;&gt; that you disbelieve &gt;&gt; the what? &gt;&gt; The naked word of God. Push the brake. Brother Brandham did it. Say you disbelieve the word of God. &gt;&gt; You disbelieve the what? &gt;&gt; The naked word of God. &gt;&gt; The word. So the word naked, &gt;&gt; in other words, the word without clothing, &gt;&gt; the avail world. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. In other words, when God open up to you &gt;&gt; and you refuse to take it [Applause] &gt;&gt; when you disbelieve the what? &gt;&gt; The naked word of God. &gt;&gt; I didn't use the word naked. It's brother. &gt;&gt; In other words, the word without clothing. &gt;&gt; The word without clothing is a veil word. &gt;&gt; But a naked one is the unveiling of God. When God unfold himself &gt;&gt; and show you plainly his &gt;&gt; his will and you refuse it. &gt;&gt; Let's read it again. Anytime that you disbelieve what &gt;&gt; the naked word of God &gt;&gt; and adopt some other way. &gt;&gt; Hey God, it shall be a turn &gt;&gt; in your flesh from there on. &gt;&gt; Guarantee my friend. &gt;&gt; Go do what you want to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will ask you five years down the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You take just what &gt;&gt; God said. &gt;&gt; If he said it, what do you do? &gt;&gt; That's just what he means. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Just take what? &gt;&gt; His word. &gt;&gt; Sarah went before the promise. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; She said, "We don't have children. &gt;&gt; Let me produce one." Sarah did not know inside of Abraham &gt;&gt; was unlimited child. &gt;&gt; Sarah went before the promise &gt;&gt; and God loaded Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Now who was the first one to cast Ishmael? &gt;&gt; Who was suffering with &gt;&gt; Hagar? &gt;&gt; Abraham say it's your servant. &gt;&gt; I just did what you wanted me to do. It's your servant. You will suffer yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Kickshell out. Who started? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You don't need to take an alternative against the word of God. &gt;&gt; Because everything you need is already new. &gt;&gt; That's right. But if you go against the word of God, God will give you the desire of your flesh &gt;&gt; and not the desire of his promise. &gt;&gt; And the desire of your your flesh will bring you trouble. &gt;&gt; You can get a car before time &gt;&gt; and that payment will make you suffer [Applause] &gt;&gt; because you bought a car by competition. You bought a house by competition. It was not your season. God loed Ishmael house. Israel car is my bill. And those bill will make you suffer. &gt;&gt; One bill, &gt;&gt; one bill, brother Glenn, &gt;&gt; will destroy your credit. And it will take seven years &gt;&gt; to clean up your credit &gt;&gt; because you went under Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Young sister, pull the brake. Young brother, pull the brake. Don't give way to this. Give time to everything. There is a season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So and so bought a house. I'm going to buy a house. Maybe it's not your time. &gt;&gt; It is that time. You will get in the high interest and you will see how you will suffer. &gt;&gt; The house will take both income. &gt;&gt; You can't sleep at home &gt;&gt; because of the mortgage. &gt;&gt; The mortgage is an is &gt;&gt; God want you to have a house, but get the house at God's time. When it comes to God's time, Jehovah Gara will provide for the income of your house. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can I continue, my friend? Can I continue, my friend? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Let's go to Genesis 17. &gt;&gt; I'm about to finish my reading. So, now we can start. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 17. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm about to finish the reading. Let's go to Genesis 17. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember how many children are inside of Abraham? &gt;&gt; Now, why did God give Abraham the name father of nation? &gt;&gt; It was based on what was what? &gt;&gt; Do you see? Now, &gt;&gt; let's go to Genesis uh uh 17. Let's keep some time quickly. Job to verse five so we save time. He says, "Neither shall your name be more called what?" &gt;&gt; Abram. &gt;&gt; But your name shall be what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; Which means what? &gt;&gt; So the name Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abraham changed to what? &gt;&gt; Abraham &gt;&gt; changed to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Ham here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brought a new &gt;&gt; meaning &gt;&gt; to Abraham. Amen. &gt;&gt; The arm here was only revealing &gt;&gt; what was inside of Abraham. &gt;&gt; In other words, what was inside of Abraham, &gt;&gt; God told Abraham, now put what is inside of you in your lip. &gt;&gt; Now begin to speak it &gt;&gt; to me and you. When we say Abraham, you are understanding Abraham. &gt;&gt; In the Hebrew, when they were saying Abraham, what truly they were saying is &gt;&gt; father of many nation. &gt;&gt; Then Abraham turned come here, &gt;&gt; mother of many nation. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So when Abraham went, he said, "I want to change my name." And they did. &gt;&gt; They say, "You want to change your name?" me say yes I want to change my name even in the social security everything &gt;&gt; what is your new name father of many nation &gt;&gt; he texts his friend on WhatsApp on a vast group chat &gt;&gt; he said from today on you call me father of many nations &gt;&gt; so when Abraham is going father of many nation &gt;&gt; in other word God begin to create an atmosphere &gt;&gt; around Abraham to realize what was inside of him &gt;&gt; to get Abraham in the mood. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; In other words, when Sarah when Abraham sees Sarah, he doesn't say Sarah. He say he say mother of many nation. Say yes father of many nation. &gt;&gt; How are you doing? &gt;&gt; Mother of many nation. How did you sleep today? He was calling a barren woman, &gt;&gt; mother of many nation &gt;&gt; and a father that doesn't have a child. Father of many nation, how are you doing? This is Bank of America calling. Can we speak to the father of many nation? When Abraham hear that remind him, God, [Music] &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; H was number eight. A was one. Right. &gt;&gt; Both of them means eternity. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So God took eternal eternity. &gt;&gt; Following me? Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; And insert eternity in Abraham. &gt;&gt; If you notice HA was not put outside the borders. &gt;&gt; H. Please help me. God push the letters &gt;&gt; and put the ha where &gt;&gt; God bring eternal life where &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Not outside of you. God have to open you then take eternal life and put it where &gt;&gt; are we together? [Applause] &gt;&gt; What was the purpose of this? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Watch my friend. He says, "Your name, verse 5, shall be called what?" Abraham, for a what? &gt;&gt; A father of many nations have I made thee. &gt;&gt; And I will make you how? &gt;&gt; Exceeding fruitful. &gt;&gt; And I will make what? &gt;&gt; Nations of thee. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Continue. &gt;&gt; And kings shall come out of thee. &gt;&gt; Fine. Now jump to verse 10. Watch with me, my friend. Stay stay put up. We good. We are good. We are good. Stay put. Let's go to 10. This is my water &gt;&gt; covenant &gt;&gt; which shall which you shall keep between me and you and your seed. What &gt;&gt; after thee? &gt;&gt; Every child every man child among you shall be what? &gt;&gt; Circumcised. &gt;&gt; So when did circumcision came &gt;&gt; after &gt;&gt; when they change what? &gt;&gt; So the changing of the name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was coming with circumcision. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because the changing of name brought eternal life &gt;&gt; inside of Abraham. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why God reflected that as a circumcision. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; In other words, circumcision was a reflection of what happened inside. &gt;&gt; In other words, the Holy Ghost got inside of Abraham &gt;&gt; in type. [Music] That's correct. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; As a covenant. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh uh verse 19. Job to verse 6 uh 15. And God said to Abraham, as for your wife, uh for Sarah, your wife, you shall call you shall not call her what? &gt;&gt; Sarah. &gt;&gt; But you shall call what? Her what? &gt;&gt; Sarah. &gt;&gt; Why &gt;&gt; shall her name be? And I will bless her and give you a son also of what? &gt;&gt; So uh so out of Sarah must come Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I will bless her. Are we together? &gt;&gt; And she shall be a what? &gt;&gt; Mother of nations. &gt;&gt; King of people shall be of what? &gt;&gt; Out of her. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 19 and we finish our reading. &gt;&gt; And God say Sarah your wife shall bear what? &gt;&gt; The a son indeed. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. and thou shalt call his his name Isaac. &gt;&gt; Was Isaac born? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But his name is already out. &gt;&gt; But we know Isaac was already there a long time. &gt;&gt; Now God revealed the name &gt;&gt; of something that was already there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So if you ask Sarah, &gt;&gt; what are you going to have? He say he I'm going to have a baby boy. His name will &gt;&gt; Are you pregnant yet? No. How do you know the child is going to be a baby boy? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You shall call his name who?" &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; "And I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after what?" &gt;&gt; Let's start preaching now. &gt;&gt; Turn your 45 minutes. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Uhuh. Check somebody's &gt;&gt; and when you together you shout amen. &gt;&gt; You ready? [Applause] &gt;&gt; If I leave you, you will be standing there. &gt;&gt; Anyway, I still have my time. &gt;&gt; So, let me get my time. You took the advertisement and the testimony. I didn't say anything. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Ah, back up my friend. &gt;&gt; God change Abraham name. &gt;&gt; Abraham was already having babies &gt;&gt; and then God put another thing to his name before the baby comes out. &gt;&gt; Why did God has to change the name? before bringing what was inside of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Follow me now. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this, my friend, God has been testing the patriarch &gt;&gt; because he has given him what? &gt;&gt; Promise. &gt;&gt; And when God make a promise, &gt;&gt; he want to be sure. &gt;&gt; Help me my friend &gt;&gt; that this person &gt;&gt; that this person is worthy &gt;&gt; of the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Before he fulfill what he said or what he did what &gt;&gt; promises. &gt;&gt; So before God give you that &gt;&gt; God must put you through a test &gt;&gt; to verify. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; If you ready to receive it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Pam continue. He says and that's the way it is with all seeds of what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; God did what? gives us that final test &gt;&gt; just before he gives what &gt;&gt; the promise &gt;&gt; and if it was possible I like to say something here personally but I for that &gt;&gt; that what &gt;&gt; final test &gt;&gt; to see what &gt;&gt; how you react upon &gt;&gt; and when he gave Abraham this test he found Abraham was how &gt;&gt; just as true as he was when he started &gt;&gt; what a blessing it will be this morning &gt;&gt; if we who take his promise of healing will do what? &gt;&gt; Would stand just as true as we did &gt;&gt; when we stood here and did what? &gt;&gt; Accepted it. &gt;&gt; No matter what the doctors say, &gt;&gt; what do you do? &gt;&gt; Stand just as true. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He say Abraham when he finally did what? &gt;&gt; Overcome. &gt;&gt; He was taken from a name of what? &gt;&gt; Abram. Say, you shall not be called Abraham anymore, but you shall be called what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; Give him part of his name. &gt;&gt; Now follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; T his name onto it. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Elohim. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; H I am. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; H A M. &gt;&gt; Which means what? &gt;&gt; Elohim. &gt;&gt; In other words, I am the father of what? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; And I'm making you a father of what? &gt;&gt; Nations. So I have changed and given you what? &gt;&gt; Part of my name. &gt;&gt; Father of what? &gt;&gt; Nations. &gt;&gt; H A M. Elohim Abraham. That is a good &gt;&gt; sentence. &gt;&gt; Did you ever think about that? A great evangelist &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; Name what? &gt;&gt; Graham. &gt;&gt; Continue my friend. &gt;&gt; G R A H A M. &gt;&gt; Billy Graham. Think of it. How that God in his mercy how he did what? for knows &gt;&gt; and thinks what &gt;&gt; that he does. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham is taking that time and bringing it to this time and saying notice there is somebody called Billy Graham. &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend, &gt;&gt; we're going to get there. What are you trying to say? Watch. When God here, here is something. I hope he don't choke you. church, help me move so we can go. If not, I don't know how I'm going to preach this. &gt;&gt; I hope he won't do what? &gt;&gt; Choke you. &gt;&gt; But look, when God, before he met Abraham, the father of nation, he did what? &gt;&gt; He changed his name &gt;&gt; from what? &gt;&gt; Abram &gt;&gt; to what? &gt;&gt; To Abraham. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What did he do? &gt;&gt; Put H A M on the end of it. &gt;&gt; And what? H A M &gt;&gt; because what he was going to bring through him the what? &gt;&gt; Father of nations. &gt;&gt; He took what? &gt;&gt; Part of his own name. &gt;&gt; Elohim and made him what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; So Abraham have a part of God in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say now &gt;&gt; if you want to know where the who? &gt;&gt; Billy Graham. &gt;&gt; Look at the end of his name. What is it? &gt;&gt; G R A H A M. You understand? &gt;&gt; Now you see everything has to be how? &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; And it is how? &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; The one that don't see it is &gt;&gt; blind. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Are we clear? Amen. &gt;&gt; He says Abraham that was the name what &gt;&gt; given &gt;&gt; and that name never rose on until just at the end time. &gt;&gt; So he has watch the name ending on what? &gt;&gt; H A M &gt;&gt; Abraham what? &gt;&gt; Elohim. &gt;&gt; And see who? &gt;&gt; Graham. &gt;&gt; Notice you just said the end time. Oh, we could break it down a little further than that, but that is far enough for you to know. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, what happened in the time of Abraham &gt;&gt; where God took part of his name &gt;&gt; and put it in. Amen. God is repeating that again. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? My friend, don't worry. Back up. Brother says this. He says, "Now here was who? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; His name has been changed from what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. do what? &gt;&gt; Abraham, &gt;&gt; which means what? &gt;&gt; Father of nations. &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; And he &gt;&gt; could not have a baby &gt;&gt; even though the babies were there. &gt;&gt; He could not have a baby as long as his name was what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; So the babies were there. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the babies were waiting for eternity &gt;&gt; to come into Abraham &gt;&gt; to open the door of the promised son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says, "And he could not have a baby as long as his name was who?" &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; He had to be changed to what? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; For Ham does mean what? &gt;&gt; Father of nations. Now notice father of what? &gt;&gt; To the nations. &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to say here, brother Brham says babies were already in Abraham. &gt;&gt; But we found out that no baby can come out &gt;&gt; because the name is Abraham. &gt;&gt; So God took eternal life &gt;&gt; and put it into Abraham. &gt;&gt; When eternal life enter into Abraham, every promised son was quickened. No more Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Now every promised son is quickened. &gt;&gt; In other words, another door has opened &gt;&gt; to bring what God promised for your life. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go slowly, my friend. &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt. I'm going to maneuver the airplane. The Bible say in Psalm 27, &gt;&gt; he said three. He say low water. &gt;&gt; Children &gt;&gt; are water. &gt;&gt; Inheritage of the Lord &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; and the fruit of the womb &gt;&gt; are what &gt;&gt; is his reward. &gt;&gt; The Bible is calling children what? &gt;&gt; An inheritage of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he's calling them something else. &gt;&gt; The children are what? &gt;&gt; The fruit of the womb. &gt;&gt; The children are fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are fruit of the womb. &gt;&gt; Follow me. My friend sir, &gt;&gt; children are fruit of the womb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fruit don't come up anytime. &gt;&gt; I have started my sermon. &gt;&gt; Fruit come in season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that through faith we understand that what &gt;&gt; the worlds were framed by the word of God. So that the things which are what &gt;&gt; seen &gt;&gt; are made of things which are what &gt;&gt; do appear. &gt;&gt; In other words, what we see visibly &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; came from what? &gt;&gt; The invisible. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; There was a time when Isaac was invisible. &gt;&gt; Then Isaac moved from the invisible to the what? &gt;&gt; Visible. So when you so so whatever is visible came first from where? &gt;&gt; Keep it my friend. My friend keep it my friend. God says what? &gt;&gt; Let there be &gt;&gt; and he was he believed what &gt;&gt; his own word. &gt;&gt; Every material things come from what? &gt;&gt; The supernatural. &gt;&gt; Let me go slowly my friend. Remember you are possessor of everything &gt;&gt; but you don't possess it materially. &gt;&gt; You first possess it supernaturally &gt;&gt; before it become material. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Father help this church. &gt;&gt; Lord help this church. &gt;&gt; This is the best part and the devil is trying to trouble you. Everything that you see naturally &gt;&gt; started invisible. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You see me today, I was invisible. &gt;&gt; I was in my father &gt;&gt; until my father married my mother. &gt;&gt; And when the time came, I came after my brother. &gt;&gt; I was not supposed to be the elder. I have my time. [Applause] So what you see naturally was already existing spiritually. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So whatever you need, you already have it &gt;&gt; as a substance. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There is. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says every material things come how? &gt;&gt; From the supernatural. &gt;&gt; God spoke the word how &gt;&gt; into existence. If he didn't, where did he get the material to make it? &gt;&gt; In other words, the material were where? &gt;&gt; Because a word is a thought. &gt;&gt; It's a thought expressed. &gt;&gt; So before God spoke, it was already in him. &gt;&gt; So creation is only bringing out what was already existing. &gt;&gt; Father, help me up. Brother Bradam say he made it because it is what &gt;&gt; his word &gt;&gt; he spoke it and said it what &gt;&gt; let there be &gt;&gt; it was when God says anything if you shall accept it and do what? &gt;&gt; Hold on to it. &gt;&gt; There are things that were in God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And God spoke the world &gt;&gt; and the world came out of God and became material. There are things that are in you [Music] &gt;&gt; that need to come out. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm going to shock you my friend. &gt;&gt; The squirrel, &gt;&gt; the desire of the squirrel &gt;&gt; were not was not in God. &gt;&gt; God doesn't need squirrel to hunt. It was a desire in brother Brana. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God was not looking for squirrel. &gt;&gt; The one that was looking for squirrel was brother. &gt;&gt; But the squirrel don't come out anytime. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My friend, about what? &gt;&gt; Two weeks later, &gt;&gt; I was done where? In the state of Kentucky &gt;&gt; where what &gt;&gt; squirrel season was still push the brake where what &gt;&gt; squirrel season was still &gt;&gt; so the squirrel also have seasonal [Applause] &gt;&gt; you don't get me my friend &gt;&gt; you don't get me my friend &gt;&gt; many people in this message we know brother Brham created square &gt;&gt; when brother Brham created square &gt;&gt; brother Brham created square in squirrel season. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Ah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hey my friend. My friend, come on. Come on. On the pulpit. &gt;&gt; He says he why it was water. &gt;&gt; Squirrel season &gt;&gt; was water &gt;&gt; still in &gt;&gt; with water. &gt;&gt; Friends of mine, &gt;&gt; Mr. Wood and his brother-in-law. And I was standing down there and we went doing water, &gt;&gt; hunting that morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, it was how &gt;&gt; windy &gt;&gt; and water. and the leaves all of the trees. &gt;&gt; It was a bad time to what? &gt;&gt; To squirrel hunt. &gt;&gt; But it was still the season. &gt;&gt; It was a bad time, but it was the season. &gt;&gt; What's the season? Even if it's a bad time, &gt;&gt; we want to make sure it's the season. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understanding me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; The desire was there. Correct. &gt;&gt; The season was there. &gt;&gt; All Brother Brham needed was the anointing. &gt;&gt; There it is, brother. There it is right there, brother. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. &gt;&gt; The children were in Abraham. &gt;&gt; The desire to have children was in Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abraham needed for HA to come. &gt;&gt; Father, help us. He says it was a bad time to do what &gt;&gt; squirrel hunt. &gt;&gt; Good hunter was not catching over a b water &gt;&gt; one a day. &gt;&gt; And when you had have a shotgun to get them with them and me water. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said the creation of the squirrel happened in squirrel season &gt;&gt; not anytime. &gt;&gt; It was in squirrel season. &gt;&gt; A desire came from Abraham &gt;&gt; to receive squirrel. Then God came in the season of square to give square to his son. Why? Because to everything [Applause] &gt;&gt; there is what &gt;&gt; a season. &gt;&gt; There is a season for squirrel. [Music] [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Father help me my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. Glory to God. He said, "You might plant wheat at one time." &gt;&gt; One time. &gt;&gt; Oh, grain and water. &gt;&gt; Another time. &gt;&gt; Somehow slower than others &gt;&gt; because it depends on what? &gt;&gt; The season. &gt;&gt; So the season determine the speed. There it is. &gt;&gt; That's why your blessing might be a little bit slower &gt;&gt; than so and so. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Because it's different season. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You getting married in May, the other one will get married in November. &gt;&gt; It's a different season. &gt;&gt; One is coming slower than the other. &gt;&gt; Because the crop are different. &gt;&gt; One is wheat, &gt;&gt; one is corn. &gt;&gt; You cannot compete. sir. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If your season has come, that's no problem. Man is coming. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Father, help me up. &gt;&gt; Father, help me up. Brother Brandham say everything comes what? &gt;&gt; Right in it season. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; You plant wheat in the fall of the year. In the spring of the year, it bring water. &gt;&gt; It sell forth. or water &gt;&gt; or God brings it forth. &gt;&gt; So who's behind the season? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this when he was talking to Nefel. He said, "Then I shall pray you, sir. What intelligence take that leaf off the tree even before cold weather and do water &gt;&gt; and sends it life back down into the ground &gt;&gt; for safety until it comes forth in another water season. &gt;&gt; You could put water in the bucket and set it on the post. It will never change by the season." So it shows that there is a God who does what? &gt;&gt; Master's life. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Back up my friend. I'm heading to the airport. Jesus was speaking here. Was speaking.

So a man is a tree. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says, "And he shall be like a tree." That is how &gt;&gt; planted by the river. &gt;&gt; The tree is not just a tree. It's a tree that is planted. &gt;&gt; It's a tree that is planted. &gt;&gt; Zero. It's a tree that is blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; May God help you. Amen. Brother Brham says this. He says, "Now Israel in Egypt was not planted." &gt;&gt; They were just what? &gt;&gt; Set out. &gt;&gt; He was not the original home ground. &gt;&gt; A man that is a Christian that rest his eternal destination upon some what? &gt;&gt; Denominational creed. &gt;&gt; He's not in his right place.

[Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me. &gt;&gt; Abraham have children. &gt;&gt; Children are the fruit of the womb. &gt;&gt; But if you give Abraham Hagar, &gt;&gt; the wrong &gt;&gt; the wrong seed come Ishmael. &gt;&gt; You need to find the correct bing ground. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you could not prosper &gt;&gt; based on the church you at. [Applause] [Music] If you sit on the wrong church, you might have fruit, &gt;&gt; but the fruit cannot come out &gt;&gt; because the environment is wrong. &gt;&gt; You are in a high God. &gt;&gt; You are in a hog church. &gt;&gt; An Egyptian church. [Applause] Father, help me up. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Ah, he says, "And he can't bring what?" &gt;&gt; For his fruit. &gt;&gt; Yet something in him is what? &gt;&gt; Longing to do it. &gt;&gt; In other words, you will notice you are in an environment. &gt;&gt; There is a desire in you &gt;&gt; to pull something, &gt;&gt; but it looks like you can it cannot come out. The problem is, watch the church. Change the environment. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You want the salvation of your church, it's already there. The salvation of your children is already there. Your [Applause] &gt;&gt; preach. Amen. &gt;&gt; The environment is wrong. &gt;&gt; God block the fruit. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't know why things are not working. &gt;&gt; I don't know why things are not working. &gt;&gt; God is the one blocking the fruit. &gt;&gt; Because if those fruit come &gt;&gt; in that wrong environment, the devil will destroy it. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me. [Applause] It's your season to be blessed. &gt;&gt; We must be grounded in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The perfect ground. &gt;&gt; A church that doesn't preach the message correctly &gt;&gt; is blocking your fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hagar was in the house of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Sarah was in the house of Abraham. &gt;&gt; So churches can be called themselves message churches. &gt;&gt; But they are Hagar. &gt;&gt; We need Sarah &gt;&gt; the promised one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mother of nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The father of nation must see the mother of nation. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen.

If you are planted in him and the only thing you have to do is water. &gt;&gt; Drink of his goodness &gt;&gt; and do what &gt;&gt; and push out whatever you have need of in this earth's journey. &gt;&gt; You drink of his water. &gt;&gt; Goodness. &gt;&gt; And what do you push out? &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of &gt;&gt; to push out that thing is where &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; Why do you desire something different than brother Greg? &gt;&gt; Because that's your program. &gt;&gt; So don't look at what somebody else is doing. Look at what is coming from you &gt;&gt; and push it out. &gt;&gt; He says &gt;&gt; whatever you have need of what &gt;&gt; this earth's journey &gt;&gt; it is all &gt;&gt; drinking &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; resting &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; peace. &gt;&gt; It is not what you struggle &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; and strive &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; and pull out. You defeat the very purpose &gt;&gt; that you are representing. When you do that, &gt;&gt; when you are pushing, &gt;&gt; you are forcing sir, &gt;&gt; you are doing things here and there, &gt;&gt; you begin to destroy your purpose. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham keeps saying don't don't be what you [Applause] &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, say Christianity is not something. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; is not one you have to do what? &gt;&gt; Beg. &gt;&gt; Please read with me so we go home. &gt;&gt; God is not somebody you have to do what? &gt;&gt; Beg &gt;&gt; or what? &gt;&gt; And cry. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; And plead. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; And fast. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Starve. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; And everything like that. &gt;&gt; Certainly not. &gt;&gt; Why you begging? Because you didn't know he was there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why you crying? &gt;&gt; You didn't know he was there. &gt;&gt; Church, &gt;&gt; you are a package. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God send you in this world, &gt;&gt; the number of children you have, &gt;&gt; your children, &gt;&gt; your clothing, the job you will work, &gt;&gt; the car you will buy, the neighborhood you will be, &gt;&gt; everything is already new. And God knew at once in in what season &gt;&gt; to send what? &gt;&gt; All you have to do &gt;&gt; rest, &gt;&gt; drink, &gt;&gt; push out. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can you can go go fast the 20 days if you want &gt;&gt; if he end the season. &gt;&gt; Right. If it's not the season, &gt;&gt; it won't happen. &gt;&gt; That's why Pentecostal are struggling. &gt;&gt; They fast every week &gt;&gt; and tomorrow divorce &gt;&gt; and they get confused &gt;&gt; because they didn't understand these things. &gt;&gt; God drop everything in you. &gt;&gt; Don't push too hard. &gt;&gt; Don't try to get alternative. &gt;&gt; You're going to load. Everything contrary to the message to the word take it away. &gt;&gt; Rest calm. &gt;&gt; Rest peaceful. &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; If a desire come out &gt;&gt; because I have a quote here &gt;&gt; where but the Bible say because the problem is how do you know it's mine? Amen. &gt;&gt; For it is God, &gt;&gt; not you, &gt;&gt; who does what? &gt;&gt; Which workketh in you &gt;&gt; both what? &gt;&gt; To will &gt;&gt; and to what? &gt;&gt; Do of &gt;&gt; according to what? &gt;&gt; His good pleasure. &gt;&gt; Who bring that desire of squirrel? &gt;&gt; Why did he come? &gt;&gt; Where was he before? Why do you want to live in the in the in the country and somebody want to live in the city? You can tell him whatever you do. The person say no, I like to see trees and nature. And the other one say no, I don't want to see trees and nature. I want because it's in him. &gt;&gt; You can't help it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Consecrate your life. &gt;&gt; Pray. Listen to the message. Keep moving. &gt;&gt; It will come. &gt;&gt; It's a tree with fruit and it depend on season. In its own season, it will bring us fruit. God bless you.

Right. &gt;&gt; But because it's the season &gt;&gt; when the truck is reserved &gt;&gt; and no truck, the woman say, "Can you bring the truck earlier?" &gt;&gt; In other words, the track reserved for somebody. &gt;&gt; Why is he working? &gt;&gt; Did I have an accident? &gt;&gt; Every demon of accident was sleeping &gt;&gt; because it's the season. When I was exiting, I was exiting slowly. Brother Robert, I have to go 30 miles because I don't want the refrigerator to scratch. And I say, "Boy, who taught you how to drive a truck?" It's the season. &gt;&gt; It is the season. &gt;&gt; Everything is working together for good because it's the season. &gt;&gt; Do you know who called me last week? Brother said, "Did I tell you the mer called me?" He said, "Pastor, do you have any other work I can do for you?" The mer begin to beg for work. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing. Father, may you reward your children for the sacrifice they have done to go extra mile beyond the hours, Father, just to receive your word. Lord, many questions, many frustration, many trouble, many sorrow, many anxiety, many lack of sleepness just because we didn't understand certain things. Why did it work? Why it's not working? Why is he lingering? Why is he working for someone else and not me? But father, your word is bringing healing. Your word is bringing everything. Your word is bringing peace and comfort. Your word is bringing confidence to let us know that everything we have need of even our Christian life, we don't have to manufacture it. We have to only drink. And as we drink, the spirit inside is growing and it's pushing out everything that you have quickened that you have put in our life to be manifested in our life. Father, there is nothing that you put in our program that would not be fulfilled until Lord Father before we leave here. And when the time will come for us to leave, whether by the way of waiting or by the way of the rapture, Father, we know that we will fulfill your entire program according to your good pleasure. Lord, may you take the word that has been spoken. May you quicken your children and father bring more revelation and quicken and strengthen our body as we commit this oncoming week unto the hand and the remaining of the day in the name of Jesus Christ.
