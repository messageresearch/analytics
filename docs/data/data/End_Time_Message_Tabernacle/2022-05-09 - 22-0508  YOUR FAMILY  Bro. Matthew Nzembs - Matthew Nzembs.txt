child who does not listen you having a mum there for me you have your family members that you want to claim you remember jayla with the same god can do it same thing and this morning not today not tomorrow not after tomorrow but today saying that prayer changes things la puerto changelos even a man a prayer changes events he's the same yesterday today forever i would like to speak now atua group there are two three groups no petition for our little children no pagan our mothers in the mail um our mothers now the first steps you probably have taken in your life speaking of leadership tonight tonight are they out here some cemetery somewhere but that was the hand that held you to make the first step then after mother taught you how to walk and you make you a few steps and then you fall down and get up evo la grande shoes and you thought you were doing great things then alameda and what you must learn how sweet the sweet comes up and so forth like that what i'm saying remember the first step that you ever made in life it's probably because of the mother that was holding your hand of course they said mama and because of their mothers then you learn how to walk and remember if somebody could just be breeding bro branham i caused the surveillance because of and the god of glory were granted in the leadership the minister of sanctions 1965. uh 31st of october 31st listen to what brother branham says paragraph paragraph 27 is let's start from paragraph nine listen carefully to what the prophet says paragraph 10 [Music] he does and there was a little boy in the fandom memories one time a name we're going to talk about him in just a little bit and it was a very fine you know what made him help him uh him a fine boy he had a good mother to raise him you seen cesar and that's what an alliance with she taught him see the lesson here about the lord amen to teach you about the lord just listen to them they could the children are you listening that's the greater the great prophet advice you have the same kind of mothers uh like onto moses but the key is just mind them or listen to them effort i'm saying is to the children they suffer from did you know that elijah anfa you say the children obey your parents which may lengthen the days upon you upon the earth that the lord thy god has given thee that to mind your parents their first sacrifice and to do what you're doing in the longest and it may give you it may give you longer life upon the earth that the lord has given you more time to on earth to serve him and that's the reason why you always need to bring your children to church in the tribe on the shows it is a good thing i'm saying but church cannot fail amen home education can fail i know a lot of people are born without their parents the marty the folks and the book of my matter of facts what your children are listening finally what your children are reading influences the character today they say they have some fun every time that you let you show children they don't know that they're going to turn into what you are uh are sowing in them example you have children they have a card with a credit commander next yeah our

remember the first steps a junior had a look and little girl made ernest and soviet a mother that gets to lead the child to his first time while that is out here you're trying to make a living mess it but it's illegal they make the first step and at a time [Music] hard for him to read excuse me i was preparing my notes i had a little bit of trouble speaking to malcolm physique thank you and led to the sheep negligent do not neglect that that taught you how to walk regardless of the later look if you have time go and listen read it again regardless of her condition never neglect that person the child comes to the father only they plan the position the father instead of standing with mom the dad start condemning mom that's a very horrible thing you can never die it's the best thing to show to somebody tell them if somebody is the best person to show to the children and to teach them always the lord my subject this morning for me it's thy house forever dude what i'm saying if you we can
