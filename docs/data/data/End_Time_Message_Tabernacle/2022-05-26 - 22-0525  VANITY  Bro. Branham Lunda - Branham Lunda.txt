about vanity amen by which we can take the word sis apparently if it speaks about jesus christ that will always bless somebody and then vanity everything is just vanity la vanita don't you ever parlay the vanity that i'm going to speak about it's going to be something that we all know my and inside we have a soul amen amen i'm talking about this buddy de la vanita when i'm speaking about vanity parlor they say i'm speaking about this one because paul says yeah in me there's like a good thing that i want to do but i'm not able to do it statistic it's like it's there's a fight within me that makes that the good thing that i would like to do but i can't do it but it's a evil that attached to me it's this body of flesh that had never been created after the image of god the being that was created after the image of god it's on the inside yes circle and this body section called modis it's a cursed body you will never see god it's gonna sound dark or avexir are we do you agree with this amen amen those are the bodies that will never see god the second [Music] this body here it's just vanity for services you know this saturday was really difficult for me and i understood by then when they told me about the pastor who passed away they told me about not a servant of god they told me about one man who was healthy he just fall fell and died and started telling me vanity and vanity everything is just vanity you'll see the first chapter the first verse ecclesiastes saying uh vanity of vanities say the preacher vanity of vanities eating all this vanity what prophet has a man of all his labor which he has taken under the sun generation one generation passed away and another one generation coming but the earth abided forever let's go for company do you understand these things you know the young man it's between our seventies and you see young men is strong and rough and the young lady is beautiful and sometimes she thinks that she's the top about her few years that generation and the little kids that you would find their way now they now take your certainly you know ecclesiastes it's a book of wisdom it says all the rivers run onto the sea yet the sea is not full in the continent lo say an apparently they see that never uh feel it's not full do seller oh that's if you continue our lives if you keep reading you can read about pleasure thinking [Applause] and everything after having all those it could have a little bit of peace but in then realized are you with [Music] they mess at home and tomorrow and then you will have no more today you can have money we wanted to there's more to kill you on a river you see and we got here in america or texas who heard about the killing the shooting in texas people are killed here in america people that have

this buddy will somebody was created after the image of god amen amen may god happen this old flesh it's vanity and vanity and just uh following ecclesiastes maybe i'll find satisfaction and you know what he had elijah said please he seek this pleasure but oh despite all that he wasn't satisfied don't dance yeah that means in this but all these there will be a destruction that will take us away

finish they will finish up your field membership this is the same thing [Applause] was in super mario i'm not married beside somebody by those that are married they know what i'm talking about because we're not in paradise we're not in the millennium yet the second daughter is married people they still have troubles they have trouble is not second on the sentence but with those that have the holy

humility doesn't look at you your clothing problems buddy what is the problem now secondness [Music] a anthem spirit savior it's coming from the flesh sex since the flesh came out of the past the flesh of the the dust as the person you leave all those money a kel can do it to somebody else it's just to tell you it's useless just to boost yourself it's useless yes [Applause] you can have something or not syllabus if the rich man has the holy spirit if the poor has the holy ghost both of you you will go to the same heaven that is why here upon you the terrier [Applause] has a lot of aspects of dimension a brother will say to mr you see my fam my wife lucky song i don't have this type of woman initially a sister that would say me to get married it's just the flesh your flesh sell a chef reduce your flesh is it truth that's right and you find out no pasta the day you get married and expecting that choice that is not in the word of god disappear when that choice will disappear and it becomes trouble in your mind because you were seeking after vanity lavre canoes have on the first while we still have strength let us work for the kingdom of god legend affair young man legend of music the young men that are playing music people that let us encourage them to work for the lord and essentially one of these days set the falsetto that strength you will you won't you won't have what's happened whatever you know let [Applause] let us give our time to god basket because most often your immunity that you have called seniors i get the may the lord bless you so humble this is not humility catholic we're not catholics be who you are be humble in your heart [Applause] that believes the world that lives the word [Applause] because with your makeup humility limitation because we when you impersonate complications i understood something in this message same message this message is very powerful a person perfectly that nobody can impersonate this message you cannot impersonate city scientific if you just try to impersonate less than 11 percent the years will pass god will bring you to my to be manifested ever manifested god will manifest and you'll prove that you were not and you were just trying to impersonate questions [Music] [Applause] because if god starts using you mightily say the lord kill you for fear of remember when you have to be careful it's when the devil already knows that since you're already a blessing for the people if he doesn't kill you physically he can kill you one way or another maybe he can make you fall with women [Music] need my transportation because when i saw in i was watching youtube i wanted to console to to do the the eventualization of the condition and then the pastor gave his condition ah you have to book my hotel for premier class you have uh to book a first class the envelope you have to prepare the envelope for this money but you see that two sessions all these things beloved say naked it just vanishes where does it come from in the message it's just this flesh [Music] and the next day it's a sign no then us beloved let us come to god i've accepted experience this is this experience of because at the end of the day more than this and today i didn't want to read a lot lee lazar lazarus and bienvenidos a beloved in the church both of them men and pastor same passion in the same church there are many ministers under the same ministry reading the same bible reading the same books what happened at the end [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] he looked there brothers in the church just sent a drop of
