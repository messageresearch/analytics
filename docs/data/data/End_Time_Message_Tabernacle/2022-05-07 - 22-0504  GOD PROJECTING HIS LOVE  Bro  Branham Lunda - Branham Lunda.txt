projecting uh and we feel that the holy ghost is leading us to read it [Applause] figure that the israel will preserve you like i always ask myself it's god who keeps saying god it's god who preserves us become apparent how by the prophet god will preserve his people that's significant dear that means that the prophet goes insane presents the prophet the presence of that prophecy is god descending for the blessing of his people forever apocalypse revelation uh book of symbols he says this so for those that are projecting notice the world is natural natural wall latum the the tomb lead regen hydrogen le cobalt cobalt all the bombs and everything that they have le mondance the whole world is trembling everything is just shaking and everything is trembling all nature is groaning you know

has love panda killing the it's just to adventure without authority a secret can present if somebody is presuming that he has the love a loki lapper that well what he doesn't have this is the time the church in his the church is in its deliverance when israel took a stand upon the pew with a little breath on top of the head uh they were marching to the reds [Applause] egypt who is leaving egypt to the the promised land he said this is the type of the church today [Applause] deliverance is at the end come israel as israel delivered them out of pharaohs and sent them a prophet [Applause] to the
