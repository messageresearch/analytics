illusion now NASA LIHEAP he mooned and that's what we are gonna talk about this morning I see this acronyms are no policy matter how when you come to the conclusion review I will reprimand we need to fasten a little bit our seatbelt online PC ramp innocent you so we are gonna heat this morning from Revelation chapter 2 verses 2223 my Tony Luhan apocalypse even do 23 notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols lmpd's it killed most divisions likely use it all and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not do need you know I think every party I never partially Ponzio this one MP DCT behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds receives a village with Ezra finally my own country Bellagio Tsukiko met editi avec Elle a mechanical rebound and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works Jeff a movie Dumas is on for a toothless eglise Canadian case we see Luke is fondly ran liquor you've andre a Shaka so you can see that the spirit speaking from verse 20 not with old withstanding this Ricky public event man secretion well I have a few things against me G Calcasieu Scott word that means the spirit as few things particularly three a scalp issues what are those of you think something shows love and that's what we are going to speak about this month this will occur on polishing matter and maybe until maybe two three weeks I do and then the Bible said appealability ah I have a few things against the de contrato ah you the people of the age of title even though your works your first works were less than the present one evoke cumulative mind work yourself but number one thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess not people are calling Jezebel prophet she's calling herself and you know if you call yourself a prophet she was a playful member a prophetess that means you are a preacher Jezebel put herself on the pulpit is that the Bible and Jezebel proclaim himself I'm a preacher the best to proclaim a predicate no you cannot be a prophet if you don't have a doctor so we will talk about the doctrine of Jesus and to teach and to seduce My servant to commit to fornication so they don't win of Jezebel teaching she was a teaching and in the meantime trying to seduce God's servants to commit fornication her teaching will be to tell young boys you know you are a young boy don't wait until marriage go to fornication are they going to do fornication we will some young girls she will teach them how to look sexy cooperate with sexy the high-heeled short skirt all this makeup brother branham say there is no woman in the Bible before Jezebel who started painting her face but she was a beautiful lady Mediterranean Jolie done painting herself Elmen painting and you know all the style and fashion a lot to say still a mood was coming from Jezebel and we will go in to study their life of just a bell was in a social life the first lady Isabella T not from your damn she was traveling with Arab in Air Force One going everywhere every time she named chocolate maybe four to three hours she dressed differently maybe short skirt hi him and when she bored again the next landing she's in a legging the top empty she was a stylist that's what I'm saying I think if I'm an MD the first lady Kennedy Kennedy you know what she did for this car if she were a head like this attention to more watch do melt all the woman to Michelle Obama Michelle Obama always sleeveless there is no more mobility in the White House got to see the White House no regard apollomon go to the house of Ahab eyelid on amazon.com you will see know where all these does though things started so she's putting people to commit fornication Matala fornication because she was a prophetess calling herself perfectly she was against all the preachers you preach you want to start marriage this way this way no c'mon silly mommy has come sister welcome no no start in secret first know yourself know your depressor you are going to even sexually kiss all these things don't follow those preachers and when the preacher will say Jezebel will take this sword to kill them visible rally pathology and to eat thick teaching the people out to eat things sacrificed to idols they kill and we read this this meaning in the previous age it's not to eat things to be partakers of the scene of the people verse 21 regardless of how bad Jesus Abell could be God gave her space to repent of her fornication he painted upon the Bible she said she repented and not you get the spirit of Jezebel we can preach as hard as we can because in the time of Jesus there was a mighty preacher on the bonham said Elijah was the pastor of Ahab and the pastor of Jezebel even though Jezebel did not accept him here I'm gonna throw a concept that some pastors want if they got to this Court I think the world of message will be booming again it's the concept of the pastor of the community brother Branham said when God sent a pastor Pipkin do either you accept him or not we like the pupa he is the pastor of the community so it's in the message what Dow what does Dow here Jeff a team hug after 10 dots toward the end and they add a queen there by the name of Jezebel and she added led all the children of Israel is Trey with her modern fantastic way of living shared caused them to commit fornication and to do evil things the teaching of Jesus if that isn't good parallel to today so it's not about history but Elijah in the midst of it all yet many of the children of Israel dozen of them had compromised and wanted to leave the modern trend of life de la vie yet Elijah would not compromise he told Jezebel her place amen the spirit of Elijah and how she must do Kumud every fail oh she hated that prophet but just the same she wouldn't claim him but he was her pastor oh there is a lot of time they don't want to claim it but a God sent men to a community is the pastor of the entire community amen that including Baptist Presbyterian and whatsoever even if you come to church then you said that's not my pastor I am I still your pastor just in a pool in a queer mom we are on Google now it's becoming hard that's the truth that's what it happened with just a bad mistake is a pathogen I'm not I don't accept her I don't accept him I'm a prophetess myself you see prophetess one by elijah said your place is not on the pulpit to start with you are a woman with you should belong to the kitchen god anoint his man and he will not compromise your wife is a pecan for metal and the people sometimes hate that's the reason why they hate all God's spiritual men we will not be surprised that some people hate us because the nature of the people when one time they give them a choice they gave them the choice between Jesus and Barnabas they say we prefer this what did Jesus do wrong that's the spirit of Jezebel hate God servant but yet he's God pastor for the amen so as we go back to the scripture Jezebel did not repent that was a verse 21 of Revelation 2 and then the Bible continues there are three verses I will combine them in many sessions so just a bell spirit no repentance verse 22 the spirit said because she did not repay must be party party behold I will cast her into a bed and brother bottom said the meaning of the bed he will cast her into the world worldliness and them that commit adultery so you see Jezebel did not do only fornication but she's also teaching adult oh you know you cannot just live with one wife one wife for life you cannot live just with one man there you know this is a free country you can go with Andrew we can go with Joseph right you can go with and God said those people all of them I will cast them into a bed and them that commit adultery with her Tsukiko matter you aim to Great Tribulation except they repent of their deed and I will kill her children with death Dumas is on phone they children of Jezebel Abed Garza will kill all of those you follow after Jezebel fashioned the spirit of dominating the husband God said I will kill their children of Jezebel and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the rain and hot and I will give unto every one of you according to your works so my sister's keep in mind the good work you are doing for God willing there is a reward and those who don't want to repent there will be consequences that woman Jezebel when you say if you see a woman painting acting like Jezebel magic he comes Isabel just cause just say hello mrs. dogmeat that was how they just about life ended Isabela Tiffany the dog had to lick her blood so that's being said so my title this morning Montezuma is a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world and we will see why whether Bonham made that statement that a dominating female it's the greatest curse in the world in the exposition of Church edges dietary encourage paragraph 227 - 1 so after the eulogy of the age Barnum said now the whole cry of God against this for age is found in his denunciation of this so the summary of the age of Styria they cry of God about this age is centered on these prophets and to understand exactly why he denounces her so we will have to look up her history in the Bible and when we find what she did back there Toula we will know what she's doing on at this time so we are not going about history but in we go back to boot to pull the material in order to better understand what she's doing now the first and very important thing that we learn about Jezebel is that she's not a daughter of thats not the seed of no is her induction into the tribes of israel one of spiritual admission as was was that of hoods the mob attests and a plan on prediction delete rebuild Israel do not mission spiritual completely like a sacred lamo a big no sir no Monsieur this woman Jezebel that from Jezebel was the daughter of F Bale you can see the name of just a bell father probably know you parishes I've been ad Bale you remember the four hundred profit of bail vindication for federal that the name of Jezebel that Ethel we know you paired Isabel earth bail at he was the king of Sidon they tell you what is he Don who was the priest and to Astarte what did Jezebel dad do he had gained the throne by murdering his puss predecessor Phillies so Jezebel alone was the daughter of a criminal they tell a hidden criminal how can you go marry the daughter of a criminal that's why brother Branham said in the message fundamental foundation of for the face of seven you want to marry check out the life of the White Witch family she's coming for me amen amen because if Arab could check out that the father was a murder she could quickly have an idea this girl I'm about to marry effectively memory may kill me tomorrow to make sure the man or caused me to be killed so we see right away that she was a daughter of a murder this certainly reminds us of Cain with inhibition Monica but we are going slowly in teaching we have all these different aspects and the way she become she became part of Israel impacted Israel was not through their spiritual channels that God has ordained for the Gentile admission a new spiritual Kaduna pool admission agency but she came in by marriage to the king of the ten tribes of Israel now this Union as we ever seen was not spiritual so there are many marriages they are not spiritual to spiritual it was political a politic I will see the people today rejoicing and married praise God praise God but which marriage is it spiritual marriage how did you start out wrinkle going what was the motive what was the objective political and so this woman who was steeped in idolatry did not have the least desire to become a worship when do they still that do hate the worship of the one true God but rather she came with about intentions this is how many people get into married you see the people getting married but there is intention jessabelle intention in getting married was to turn Israel away from the Lord no wonder we will see many good brothers many good sisters right after marriages the problem I can barely recognize them they append every connect because somebody added intention are you are living like this do this do this I'm gonna marry that person I'm gonna turn her you like points for me I think I will go in more detail on the political marriage in the days to come but skipping going to paragraph 214 - 3 this is where marijuana made that statement it is most worth Lee of note that the very name tight area means dominating of female that's the meaning of the edge tighter it's a dominating female and brother bottom told us whenever you find a dominating female occupy in from domina trees it's the greatest curse in the world Allah prediction dilute Nam and I'm not talking or it's not concerning our precious sisters the one who really submissive to their husband and carrying themselves as a lady and we thank God for want to encourage them to continue like that so the name title remains dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force Allah that Allah contains the province of domina trees a force that roughly invades all invited mm sama conquers all we compete on k2 and despotically controls a key controls RPG a dominating female is a controlling power in from the minute restate in Prasanthi control C control beauty control that is a booty and help sexual power is that we saw sticks well excuse me to be a little bit nervous and the bottom said when I'm now a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world and I pleaded my addiction dalam on that's my title lastly motive skipping a little bit we read it last Sunday and Paul said I suffer not a woman to teach or to usurp authority that's the Bible let's take it in first Timothy chapter two when I don't anticipate for do I suffer not a woman to teach and permian from depression now you look at revelation jessabelle was teaching and said juicy but the Bible cannot contradict itself and this is also valid for all their religions any religion where they can F a woman preaching in funky fresh that's a dominating force at 1850 you mean that's occurs I cannot understand somebody who has been taught in the message leave the message to go in a church with a woman pastor awakened from pastor and I'm gonna touch a little bit the approach of the woman allows you Pamela have posted on why a woman cannot deplete wala family to appreciate because she was not in the original creation that's it and the policy Paul D but I suffer not a woman to teach so a woman whose teaching is exactly the same as a woman who's usurping authority over the man a lot of things that don't issue along so don't blame the woman preaching Alabama in funky-fresh if you as a woman not you as Jezebel as a woman I was you shopping authority over the husband the husband could not say much everything was sent on Jezebel to the extent when somebody does anything to the husband they ours were was going to complain to his wife Melissa plan pick up that spirit of domination do me no you have to watch it twice a woman was not made for such a woman shall never but to be in silence there is for Adam was the first for Bianca me for me then if that's the reason because the woman was not in the original she and Adam was not deceived identity possibly but the woman being deceived was in the transgression myself um kisses said with 70 Cooper the translation because the woman was the one was deceived especially from Kate is a bit and that's what how the woman if what they see and we see it from that time until today when a woman is at the age to bear children the world is on phone she add a period every month I like to use a period shot more so you see a baby girl born children there is no age does the blood of guiltiness until she reached the age of menopause now you will let a woman in with the blood to lead the church that's why knowing that the woman came not to do this but he did not say that the woman are lost there is an opportunity given to the woman to those who want to conduct themselves as real real that's a policy notwithstanding they are more she shall be saved in childbearing as soon as so the undoing and even on male that's why God gave to the woman three special virtues special virtue virtue of her mother would that means a woman must have the mother would but it would mean willing to deliver babies because in delivering the baby that built another character in the woman to love and care for the baby they may show you baby look at even the animals when a dog is the baby's whole animal neighbor even if you are you out acquainted with the dog as he was at a beach ocean one share the baby you come closer baby then doctor because her heart hallelujah these in their babies so one of the virtue that God has given to the woman is the woman would not afford to live her babies unattended that's a strong statement that these where the baby is only baby so that's something God as differentiate between a man and a woman can play with the babies watch out two men a man who's taking the position of knowing to change you can help your sister your wife you can change but you become special in the cooking in the diaper changing the children I will look at you twice that's the woman would hello this is the teaching we have to go in more detail so not only the woman would but their womanhood the woman would is her way of acting as a woman a woman must always have that nature of a woman not a woman before men fighting from the venom she doesn't care she's dead you go to their house there has been sitting in the living room with others whatever topic there is there is a entertain and you see all the women or the men quiet the woman taking all that explaining explaining or the past they preach their womanhood oil oil oil oil oil or something is wrong somewhere that's not the nature of usurping authority many don't know what to do their woman the type of woman who knows all we need to you go in chemistry see me h2o 2 h2o is water was given a formula you go in our physics is there you go in even in the preaching she's dead no no no no no no hello Oh why people are commenting woman that's not a woman there for young boys willing to get married Somali wait look at the woman no thing today the young boys the only thing they want is to about the virginity and that will be a curse she is involved in everything they find a woman the man at work on Slava why did it for you contest Fantasia see that manager the one we went to following this one what did you do if the manager was white like black man I'm gonna show you that's not a woman hello that's what brother bottom said about their their womanhood you'll imagine until a laugh a minute eh let me find that in a message the invisible union of the Bride of Christ what the poem said notice now she has a sacred trust of worth virtue that's been been given her trusted to her by the Lord God gave her that virtue just as it was in the Garden of Eden she can say yes or no no she has committed to her she has a sacred trust of womanhood committed to womanhood the womanhood I'm speaking of I'm speaking of here this character around man a man when you see women around the men of where in feminism acting like maybe she calmed Islam when there is a discussion she argue with in the living room our place is in the kitchen the men are talking about the football football she's evolved LeBron James River what is the matter with you Jezebel doesn't God as against the edge of you get involved in so many stuff and when she start talking you know even notice the men are quiet and that woman among even five or six boys talking like nothing was taken something is wrong and I'm teaching this I believe somebody's gonna be helped I have a girl to was talking to them you know I did I say same way I say to the church did I say that you cannot talk but what I'm talking about you know Adam there is something in between being a real woman even in greeting something is wrong somewhere that means a seed was closed somewhere and ridiculous the most I think was a calculus what they call in French Lick Oh serve this alone because of this alone they are everywhere talking talking to they terminate like that I do mean concern and to the extent that woman Jezebel was not only commenting her house come on the Paschal most apropos she became also able to comment other houses should go see other sisters Jezebel the prophetess weave a doctrine how do you do my dear not only 50/50 we are almost of the 60 semestre Santos I'm newly pharmacist and they men go down you don't see the salary that means you don't shop shopping which kind of scared they might habit you don't know those are tied to sexy passage with lucky sexy she influenced the other woman and then she goes yeah alpha tomorrow the men come to this from now on don't buy me a skirt anymore magic with you that's the doctrine of jihad and when there is an argument the other woman jezebel just pick up the phone not talking to the woman talk to the men white sisters before you pick up a phone to talk to a man you know what to say I don't say that you can greet a bride but when there is issue in somebody's family don't get involved up on a pitch the message the religion of Jezebel 19 this is where brother Branham was telling the matter regarding marriage it's not yours leave it to the pastor why because just a very clever yourself as a prophet with the spirit of Elijah in the last days will continue to send her back well apart so the woman must have own character differed in talking before me even in acting Manoj ISA dressing they should dress as a lady you cannot break the limits with a publicity man leave me something happen here the man the woman is always ahead the man is the following run this is exactly what to Jezebel did you may think I'm just telling the stories as I said on Wednesday but upon him said in the message Mary's belief fog after teen he said a woman must be sweet soft well her pretty eyes talk about Joseph and Mary Joseph and Mary while her pretty eyes look at him like that of the dog the comely hidden column soft innocent country I think that's the way a woman should look report if he comes in a confirmed operator innocent soft and sweet but if you see a woman not too sweet my severe anemia produce military military so that's what a military military that's something is wrong God has given men a wife to soften the men who even in argument even in debate the woman when the women take a position on maybe the men said I'm gonna punish this child I'm gonna punish this child prefer the woman is this soft possible approach you do you'll be to be to be trap you will come because this is where you can that's the nature of a woman but if we see a woman that is beating beating she came with a gun hello hello why am I talking to why are you quiet but I'm just giving you some illustration so that this thing can sink deep eyebrow say that a woman cannot beat the child but I'm showing is something different Jodie DeFeo a woman is a different she must be soft tender when even the men are in argument with other people then nature God knows the men get into argument even with his own family that is asking too much money here women died if they are coming to you it's because they don't have a wife asking for money cut a chick just shine Geneva telephone applause Bobby so now with you oh we are missing a piece a piece in the puzzle but is there to wadham

for know when a woman tries to act like a man like a man do you comment on and I'm saying like that's not given to a woman you may think I'm making comments no woman has a special way of talking different from a man not solid but if you see a woman very authoritative when I say it is the period something is wrong talk like a man she's out of her place a woman is feminist sweet loving not being even in school sisters in a feminine way she's not supposed to be and when she does that her life is prophetic she's sweet loving kind where Adam is more the burly type a lot I don't approve did the character for he was the man the masculine type masculine the woman was a feminist but it's the same spirit messily mammoth before he took her from Adam asked Allah wisdom and noticed this year we were talking well fornication and adultery it so that woman Jezebel she was a very stubborn woman when you see a woman very stubborn pretty something is wrong that's not the nature of a woman you do this I'm gonna do this I'm not gonna do to the extent where it may get mad I start to beating the wife you see the nature of this stubborn spirit you are that's another person inside that's what the woman that's your wife that's not a woman a woman has a different spirit that's the truth young people you have a lot to look at you are going into the decision step no sorry boy you just do this and

an important key she crossed the border you know I was the king of Israel if you look at the map of Israel it was divided into the north was Israel and the Judah was in the south so in the north that

don't think that the one will talk a lot she's the one Dominator give me the sweet thunders are in [Music] [Music] Chapter six sixteen let's go to first church one but I'm speaking with all my entire heart because those are you think killing the house killing the believers this is a shame for some to be called Christian and they do this they come to each community and Minya be submissive it's a blessing and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat come see suitable leader chose delivery he took to wife of King in the house of worship in - that's what Jezebel did in Israel you see a woman say - ever was an imposing robe in the easily what I said is what you're going to do that's a really enter Christ laughing ha Monte Cristo and that's death because after this age tighter weave all that Jezebel as done the next age life vivo Saudis what does it mean God is saying here I will kill Jezebel which you racism and all her daughter so it was a spiritual death because of that woman Jason God say I'm gonna kill you kill also your daughter she reversed all the altar next verse and I have made a grove and Arab did more

that you cannot keep your leg your nails when I get to the dressing I'm gonna touch all those little things to say to teach that Jezebel was doing that's why I say I have a long Syria and because of this the anger of God you came let me skip this let's take another chapter first King chapter 17 I'm not gonna hit but I'm just if you can follow if you put this right so that I can get this idea first King that was chapter 16 chapter 16 was talking about how Jezebel was married hollynewcombe Elizabeth City married now we move to first Kings chapter 17 godsend Elisha the prophet and Elisha the prophet in spoke the word there will be no rain during that time the panettone that was no held and God took Elijah yep really to the widow of theropod to feed Elijah and chapter 18 of first King repeatedly sweet it was now Elijah before the prophet of bail manasa alida valli profitable because Jezebel was a prophetess she as her servant and Elijah the pastor of the age he did not bow Jezebel regardless you are a woman I'm a man God sent me it was a fight finally it come to a showdown the common mount Elisha said if your God is really good let him respond by fire if mine is god and the prophet of bail they came they cry the guy being in vain and Elijah was coming cry louder maybe your God is in vacation somewhere I think and then Elijah came and when he set up everything they call a table to do so they fire for take all the four hundred profit of a bale and it wasn't profitable kill them and when they kill them if only that you Jezebel was not their disability Paula but Ahab was day mayor Kabat illa a heifer was looking in his heart was not happy but what did he ever went to accuse Elijah to his wife let us read the Bible because when I say he said let's take first Kings chapter 18 I was a bit wordy sweet let's take verse 37 first Kings chapter 18 verse 37 hear me o Lord hear me that these people may know that they are the Lord God and that is au has turned their heart but again yes a Toki remember what that was the prayer of Elijah till appeared then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and linked up the water that was in the tribe will absorb allocated all of knowledge for sale and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they say their Lord he is God the Lord is the God and Elijah said unto them take the profits of baby profitable let no one of them escape or candy shop and they took them really busy and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon 200 keys and slew them there Elijah doesn't play and Elijah said that means when Elijah was killing all the Prophet goes it to the Prophet a happy birthday I live the Bible and then after you kill just set out to get the app month eat drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain i'm wikia not lovely that was it you can call them you talk with them no thing let him go home the next day he's coming with some idea where did you get that sexual power behind up with so sexual there yeah that's exactly I have it was Arabic at me so I'm gonna skip this just before they think now after this we go to chapter 19 now jump to nineteen verse 1 after they came there that all that Elijah has done who specified as Kapoor comprehensive shows why did you know talked to Elijah and I go she to the perfect what my prophet let us just read the Bible you will see what just a mere say and without how he added slain all the prophets with the sword come I'll evacuate when Jesus heard that verse 2 then Jesus about send a messenger to the man cannot say Amen just give the report number 14 really Jezebel took over a message to all the send a messenger of logic a woman who's supposed to be sweet who's supposed to be kind lovely I'm taking over the man what a man is not able to do Jezebel was always on the font little sisters go in the back send a messenger to Elijah say so let the guard to do me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow do it but which kind of a woman the man could not say anything but man just give their reports about Nepal just about kill all of them kill off their messenger come here maybe just a bell messengers go tell Elijah by this time tomorrow she hears the finish and the messenger when telomeres a party verse 3 and when Elijah heard that viola be larger gun a little device on Allah laughs we in latter hand if we to spare his life but still it's not the end of this talk nothing it was a palace and released or when he'll a Jahan colony sarff we where did he go who s Philippa Elijah went to play in the cave and so forth and when he went let's go to verse maybe 25 I believe verse 18 the Bible said nobility everybody was afraid of Jezebel but
