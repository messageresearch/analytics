[Music] so [Music] i've stood on the banks of a wide-ranging river trusting that i'd get across i've weighed my way through some valleys and deserts believing i never get lost [Music] i've been at the foot of what felt like mount everest i'd have the strength for the climb cause through every trial each test and temptation one thing is sure every time over and over again and again god is faithful over and over again and again through it all he's made me to stand and survive to come through [Music] is with me so i claim the victory over and over again [Applause] [Music] if you ask me why i have no hesitation god does what he said he will do and i'd simply say every battle has taught me there's nothing he won't help me through so why should i dwell on the hardships and struggles when i look just beyond them i see the way this will end is with great celebration deep in my heart i believe oh over and over again and again god is faithful oh over and over [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's made me able to descend and survive to come through a lot when it should look jesus is with me and i claim the victory over and over again [Music] god is faithful yes he is over and over again and again through it all he's made me able to stand and survive [Music] [Music] jesus is with me so i victory over and over again jesus is with me so i claim the victory over [Applause] again [Music] [Applause]
