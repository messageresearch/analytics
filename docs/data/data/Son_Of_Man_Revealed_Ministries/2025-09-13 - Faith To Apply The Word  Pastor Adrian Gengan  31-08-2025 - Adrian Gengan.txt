========================================

always. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time to give God glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't want to miss this opportunity. You know, when God does something, you need to give him glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God does something, you need to honor him. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God does something, you need to praise him. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that is what if you go through the Bible, you'll see everybody praise the Lord &gt;&gt; when something happened. &gt;&gt; No matter how big. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No matter how small. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God must be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he is the only hope that we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the hope of glory that we share &gt;&gt; together as believers. &gt;&gt; And we have to encourage one another. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Through this journey. We have a journey that is full of storms. We have a journey that is full of uh troubles and winding roads and gravel roads and mountains. We need to climb. &gt;&gt; But we will climb it together. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to honor you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This morning, I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a privilege this morning to stand before you and say thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Going back to 2020, I had no hope. There was no hope. But we thank the Lord that he is the hope that we can take. And at that time I said, "The Lord there was no purpose for me to be on earth. I've served you honestly with everything that I have." It was wind, rain or storm. There were times that I preached in the open air at 32° 33°. Although I was a hard patient, you would say, but I said, Lord, if you if there is a purpose for me on earth, I am prepared to stay. But if there's nothing, Lord, take me home because it was so much too bad that my body just couldn't take it. When I heard the nurse say, "I don't know whether this uncle will make it." As she closed the door to another nurse, and that was I think it was about 1:00 in the morning. And that's when I cried out to the Lord. I said, "Lord, you are my only hope. And as I lay in this bed, as you said, you will not leave me nor forsake me until the end of this world." I said Lord I will not stop serving you but if it means that I need to come home please. And then it was 1:00 in the morning when I never had a bit of sleep. I slept like a baby. The doctors came. They said let him sleep. They told the necessity they went away and coming back and I could see there was like you know the prophet says when God is going to heal you the situation becomes worse. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you must know that the healing is taking place. And you know when you read the prophet's message and you live the prophet's message, there is nothing that you will forget in the time of trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing. You can't forget nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this thing came to my remembrance. I said, "Lord, you told the prophet before there's a healing, there's going to come a time of worsening." Anyway, I went to the doctors this week. I saw the phmologist. He had a look at me and you know he was just so happy and he said you are strong man. You know he said you are strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I sat there and he said you know what you are one of the most fortunate people that are around. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I said it's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I said it's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I said with lung cancer, you only have 12 months. Said with lung cancer, it's 18 months maximum. You'll be gone. But he said, "Look at you." I told him, "Just God's grace." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm stud. It says 5 years. He said, "We got steps and I'll show you the steps." I said, "The Lord has done the work." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And on Thursday, I had an M and I scanned them and I thought, Lord, I don't think so the devil has got any more any more chances in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He tried it. He did it to Job. He did it to all the servants of God. But he's finished. I had my scan and Friday I went for the results and the ancologist said, he looked at me again. He said, you know, he just smiled and he said, you know what, you are strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, you know, it's just because we caught it early and and all that. And he says, you know, I said, but it's the grace of God. and he looked at me and he said, "We will only do blood tests once a year and we'll do MRI twice a year." I mean, two every two years. It says, "I think this is over." I don't think so. After 5 years, we never saw anybody having it. And I just want to encourage you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you this morning. Whatever you are looking for this morning in your life. Whatever it is, no matter how small, no matter how big, we have a great God. &gt;&gt; We want to give him glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the great things he has done. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not only in my life, &gt;&gt; I think in many of your lives also. And I want to say to God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Great things he has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there is, you know, I can give you a testimony. It can go for hours. But I want to tell you this morning, this God is a never failing God. &gt;&gt; He is never late. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is always &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; on time. &gt;&gt; He will turn the thing around. Amen. &gt;&gt; He can even turn the clock around. &gt;&gt; That's him. &gt;&gt; And nothing can change. &gt;&gt; He is the same &gt;&gt; yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lay your burdens at the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Lay your burdens there, &gt;&gt; and God will make a way where there seem to be no way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The turns will be very great. The mountains may be high. The seas may be deep, but our God can go anywhere. I was just reading this morning, you know, when Ezekiel asked, "Can these dry bones live?" If the dry bones jumped up and lived in that senior and everything, what about us this morning? &gt;&gt; We have flesh, we have blood, &gt;&gt; we have voice, we have breath, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Who I am, Lord. Who I am. [Music] I can see now. &gt;&gt; Who I am. &gt;&gt; You see, I'm part of my savior. I'm part of his word. It's a revelation.

And I pray, Lord, that you come and speak to us through your precious word, Lord. We commit ourselves, Lord, before your mighty hand, oh God. We pray you'll bless the hearer and bless the speaker, oh God. But Lord, even as we under the expectation of what you will say this morning, Lord, we come before you with our needs, Lord, deferring one from another, we come before you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we're inquiring Lord that you come, Lord, and meet with us in a special way this morning, oh God. Lord, we do not want to leave this place until you touch us. Oh God, until you speak to us, oh God, commit all things into your under your precious name and by your name, by your word, oh God, we ask your blessings now in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. all must thanksgiving in our hearts, Lord. We say amen to your word, Gloria. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. I greet you all in the precious, the holy name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's give the Lord one more good anchor of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's worthy of praise. Amen. Worthy of glory, worthy of honor. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, I greet you all once again and welcome you in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to come and serve the Lord. Amen. And even as we see the gentile days are closing in. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're always growing late. But God has sent a message to prepare us for that body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the message that's going to change our bodies. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The very word that we are feeding on the brother Brandham says our new body will materialize around that word because this word has strengthening power. &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Brandham calls the message the shout he calls it the living bread of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not just ordinary bread. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We eat bread that's not living. &gt;&gt; But he calls this the living bread of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So a living bread of life to a living people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And one of these days his body has got to give way to the word that we are feeding on. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Amen. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel &gt;&gt; when he shall begin to sound. &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets. Now people are confused with that scripture. They think that that is the seventh trumpeting angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you read the book of Revelation, when an angel is sounding, it will say the angel sounded. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's saying when he shall begin to sound. &gt;&gt; So the seventh angel is a he, not a she. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh angel is a man from the earth. The prophet says the seventh angel is on earth at the time of the coming of revelation 10 angel. &gt;&gt; So when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets. The Lord had blessings through the reading of his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So I also want you to remember Amen. Uh I forget the name of family. Amen. But if you know brother Clive, that's s's uh father. &gt;&gt; Amen. He passed away yesterday. &gt;&gt; And so we pray that the Lord will be with the family. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember them. He was just 61 years of age. &gt;&gt; But he was a man who stood for the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He believed the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh that's if you know Pastor Trish. Amen. From Kumas, that's his brother. So we remember the family in prayer. Amen. even as they go through this time of grieving and loss in their family. Amen. We pray that the Lord will be with them. So, amen. So, we want to get into our message this morning and maybe for a simple title, call it faith to apply the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith to apply the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have faith to believe the word. &gt;&gt; We all have faith to believe the word. &gt;&gt; We have faith to receive the word. &gt;&gt; But do we have faith to apply the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we want to see where we are currently &gt;&gt; and see what is required. &gt;&gt; Because if I ask all of us, we all believe the word. &gt;&gt; So we don't need faith to believe. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; We all have received the word. &gt;&gt; We don't need faith to receive the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But where we are lacking is the application of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith to apply the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know that in our kingdom now in in our first port here, we'll go to Christ the mystery of God. Just to lay our background, we are talking about a headship and we are the lively stones that are connecting with Christ the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are here to welcome back Christ &gt;&gt; on the earth. &gt;&gt; So our headship is Christ and he says our headship is a kingdom. &gt;&gt; So the kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; That's not foreign to us because it's Christ in us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; So he's just putting it another way saying the kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; So when Christ is in you, you become the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So kingdom has laws, kingdom has principles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus said the kingdom, we are not a denomination. We belong to a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the kingdom is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not lose sight of the simple statement. The kingdom is the word of God which the prophet brought to us to put the word of God in us. To put the kingdom of God within us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, what he's saying, the kingdom is the word of God and it's to be made spirit and life in our own life. &gt;&gt; So, when the word comes inside of us, it must becomes because Jesus said, "My word is spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And my word is life. &gt;&gt; So, that word that's within us becomes spirit and life. It becomes a living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when that word starts to push out, it's going to push out unbelief. It's going to push out doubt. It's going to push out reasoning. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've got to allow the word to have effect on our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bringing to pass every promise in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when I'm saying in this day, I'm talking about August 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. To the day and to the hour. &gt;&gt; I don't want yesterday's promises. &gt;&gt; Yesterday's promises were good for yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want the promises for today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and God was one. And the word and God is one in his church today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word and God was one in Jesus Christ. The fullness of the God dwelt in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying that was that day. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when Christ comes in you, &gt;&gt; he says the word and God is one in his church today, making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken from the dead in the resurrection. So Christ has come in you, the spirit of Christ has come in you to bring a resurrection in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; God don't want you to remain trapped in a flesh body. But the message of the hour, the word of God has come now to translate our bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I can use this as a measuring line. Jesus Christ died. He rose again. And he has set it up here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's been 2,000 years. People think that things are still continuing the same, but time has moved on. &gt;&gt; We are not here anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither are we here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are almost right here. If I can put it right here. We are ending finishing. &gt;&gt; But just because we can't see through God's eyes in the timeline, we may be thinking we somewhere here and there's still far more time for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Don't be mistaken and don't be left behind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be when the message is urgent, we ought to get into the things of God. We ought to make sure that Christ is living within us because the only provided place of worship is Christ in me. The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where he put his name. Yes. &gt;&gt; God hasn't put his name on a church building, but God has tabernacles of the living God. God has put his name on me. I'm a branded ambassador of Jesus Christ. Amen. People brand Catholics. People branded property. Amen. But I'm branded by the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ has put his personal seal upon me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch now. and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and will restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning in the Garden of Eden. The three-fold mystery of God, his body. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Now, watch what he's trying to do. He's trying to bring the mystery down to show you that you are a part of the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you know the mystery ends in you? &gt;&gt; Come on, church of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not God above us. It's not God will. Amen. With us. It's God in us. &gt;&gt; God in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What he says now continuing. And when Christ takes you over, he'll express that word right through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Through you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to see the word fly past you. The word is coming through you. &gt;&gt; Because it's him. He is the word. And then you can see the expression of Christ. Not some illusion of some sort, but a real genuine Christ expressing himself right through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How will the world see Christ right through you? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, how can we stay silent? &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Christ must be expressed through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. People think that Jesus is Amen. Christ is walking through a great group of people. No. Listen to what he says. He says, "Who do you say I am?" He's asking the church. He's 12 out of millions that day he asked 12. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord. &gt;&gt; His church in the day he says in millions in the days of Noah he asked eight. &gt;&gt; And he said as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man. See where eight souls were saved. I don't say there's going to be eight saved. Now don't get that all wrong. I never said that. I don't know how many is be going to be saved. He says that last moment to rapture that little group. &gt;&gt; It'll be a small group. I tell you that. &gt;&gt; For straight is the gate and narrow is the way, but few there'll be that find it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm one of the few. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can testify. I'm one of the few that has found it. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to go in any broad way. I want to stay in the straight way. No matter how narrow it gets, I want to stay in the narrow way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, how many of us can say we've been in the message and we don't know the word? &gt;&gt; We all know the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. How much more of the word must teachers and preachers come to explain to us? &gt;&gt; I don't think it it's more of the word that we need. I think that people are failing to apply the word. &gt;&gt; We know how to do things. We know what the word says about us. We know what's to be done with the word. But we are we don't we maybe don't have a don't care attitude that we not interested to apply the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know the word but we don't practice the word. &gt;&gt; Oh help us Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; We are hearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are recognizing. &gt;&gt; We are believing. &gt;&gt; But we are not acting. &gt;&gt; But true believing will make us act. Now if there's no acting, if there's no action, our believing is in vain. &gt;&gt; We will not see any results of our faith. &gt;&gt; Now in this time and season, the word that's been put into us is producing perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't be expecting with this end time message. Don't be expecting a weak faith. &gt;&gt; With this end time message, we ought to be expecting perfect faith to be produced through us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray that you hear what I'm saying this morning. We are not looking for some kind of mustard seed faith. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour didn't come to produce mustard seed faith. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came to produce perfect faith, a faith in a walk like Enoch had. Amen. To change this old vile modies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say it's based on expectation. If you are expecting, Amen. a little bitty fade out of this message, you're going to be sorely disappointed. But if you're expecting, amen, a changing of the body, if you're expecting, amen, the resurrection of the sleeping saints, that's what this message has come to produce. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to act on our faith. We will not see any results if we don't act on our faith. And the Holy Ghost is the action of God in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to believe the word. Faith to receive the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know faith is the revelation of the word. We all have a revelation of the word but free to operate the word. &gt;&gt; Abraham had faith to receive the word. &gt;&gt; Get thee out of thy country. He received the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had faith to follow the word. &gt;&gt; He had faith to let the word lead him. He had faith to believe for the impossible. Even when they told him, you are past the age of childbearing. &gt;&gt; Abraham, you don't even have enough seed within you. &gt;&gt; Abraham's Amen. Sarah's womb is dead. Amen. But even past these years, he still had faith to believe God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, God told Abraham they were going to have a son. &gt;&gt; His name shall be called Isaac. Yet his wife is barren. &gt;&gt; He and and time passes, even in his natural strength, he can't now reproduce his own life. He passed that age of childbearing himself, &gt;&gt; but he still held on to the word. I'm saying your situation, &gt;&gt; it's not too far gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Science was even testifying to Abraham and Sarah that you can't have a child anymore. But God goes above and beyond science. Amen. No matter what the doctor's report is, no matter what your situation is, hold on to God's word because God's word will never fail. &gt;&gt; If God has given a promise, heavens and earth will pass away, but his word will never pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It may sound like a foolish thing this morning that we are talking about preparing for a rapture, preparing for a body change, something amen that the world thinks is impossible. Something they think is a story in the Bible. Maybe it happened to Enoch. Maybe it happened to Elijah. But will it happen to us? I say yes, it shall happen to us. That's my faith. Amen. That's what I'm believing. Amen. I'm not believing this end time message for no reason. Amen. I believe in this message because it's a promised word for a body change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have expectation for believing this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's promises attached to believing this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not just wandering around idle here. Amen. I have a promise to believe the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message must produce something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Otherwise, we can go to just any church and just expect and say maybe one day the Lord will appear in the sky. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And we'll all be changed. Amen. Every eye will see because every television network will now broadcast. That's what denominations believe. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But they don't know the hidden mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That Christ is descended with a shout. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Revelation 10. The mighty angel has come down with a shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That might sound amen to you. But you know that's a hidden mystery to them. They don't know that the mighty angel has come down in 1963. Amen. They don't know that the mighty angel Christ came down to open up the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you go to Romans 4:18 there, you'll see. Amen. The kind of faith that Abraham had who against hope believed in hope. &gt;&gt; That he might become the father of many nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say, Amen. that you shall become the owner of many business. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes. I don't expect everyone to catch what I'm saying here. &gt;&gt; He was the father of many nations &gt;&gt; even before he could have a child. I said that you shall be the owner of many business. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; According to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith. Now listen to this. Faith is now going to become measurable &gt;&gt; in strength. &gt;&gt; Yes. So there is a kind of a weak faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying he being not weak in faith. &gt;&gt; He considered not his own body now dead. I say don't consider your symptoms. Don't consider the doctor's report. Don't consider your unemployment. Don't consider your current situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He considered not his own body now dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was about 100 years old, neither yet the dimness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can say the same thing. We are not staggering. Amen. At the word of God. There is no unbelief in this bride. There is nothing in this bride that Satan can work through. There is no unbelief in this bride that Satan can work through. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came to eliminate all doubts. Came to eliminate all fears. Amen. There is nothing in this pride that Satan can work through. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan can only walk through doubt and reasoning. And this message has come to eliminate all doubt and every reasoning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen now. Yes. Here's the opposite of weakness. Being staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith. &gt;&gt; Giving glory to God. Which means Abraham's faith had muscles. Abraham strength that had chest air on his chest. Amen. Abraham was burly. Amen. Abraham had faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And being fully persuaded what he had promised, he was also able also to perform. And therefore, it was imputed to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Do you know that God sees you as righteous because you believe his word? &gt;&gt; Because of your faith that you have in this hour, if he imputed faith to Abraham for righteousness, your faith is going to be imputed to you for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it was not written for his sake alone. You see? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it was imputed to him, but for us also. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Get this now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The faith of the hour that you believe in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you have received to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead which all who was delivered for offenses and was raised again for our justification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he had to apply his faith. Faith requires application. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say faith requires application. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know where where his faith, he had to apply his faith when God now gives him a son who's about 11 or 12 or 13 years old and he tells him, "Kill that son." &gt;&gt; Kill that son. &gt;&gt; That job you've been praying for and waiting for so long to receive, leave that job. Amen. &gt;&gt; The home you built there in the tents, the finest tent you had in earth, leave that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where he leads me, I will follow. &gt;&gt; Where he leads me, I will follow. You invested all your time and energy in this boy and in this girl and he tells you, "Leave that girl. &gt;&gt; Leave that boy." &gt;&gt; Application of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Kill your son. Sure. &gt;&gt; And Abraham follows through showing his faith was the faith of God. &gt;&gt; He says, "The God that gave me this child when I couldn't have child is the one that can even raise up this boy." &gt;&gt; And he spoke the word even before it even happened. He said, "I and the lamb shall return." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even before he went up the mountain, he spoke the word by faith. And the word of God will not return void. Abraham spoke the word and he said, "I and the lamb shall return." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The word has got to be in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He This man caught the mind of God. He knew how to speak like God. He started to call those things which were not as though they are. &gt;&gt; He told his servants, "I and the lad shall return." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How about our faith? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We have toothache. We tell our wife, "Hey, I don't know if I'm going to make it." &gt;&gt; I and the lad shall return. &gt;&gt; Amen. What we're talking about is faith. Amen. That needs to be applied. Faith requires application. &gt;&gt; And to apply something means to practice it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Joshua and brother Jeff, you got a law firm. It's also called a practice. Is it called practice? &gt;&gt; Because you're practicing the law. &gt;&gt; And the kingdom of heaven also has laws &gt;&gt; that needs to be practiced. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you may not win every court case because sometimes you may not have known a certain law because don't tell me you'll know all the law. You still learning things. Amen. All lawyers still learn things. There's also case law that they can reference. So, amen. Even as we start to learn these things and start to practice the things of God, things start to become more clear to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the next time we have a situation, the next time we have a case, we know how to apply the law. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And why do they reference another case? Governor versus Marimut &gt;&gt; is because case law once a court makes a ruling. &gt;&gt; Amen. What does it become? &gt;&gt; It becomes a president set. So whatever that judge ruled, you can quote it and say, "But he ruled and found this man in favor." &gt;&gt; Therefore, you've got to rule the same way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says it this way. Anytime a son and daughter of God meets the same requirements of God's word, he's obligated to answer that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So the word is in the bride. We all know that. That's a powerful quote. The word is in the bride. And he says she knows what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; But I'm asking you, do you know what he wants done with the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants you to apply the word. &gt;&gt; He wants us to know what to be done with the word. So the word must be applied. And to apply means to practice. &gt;&gt; To apply what we know is to practice, to put to use. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in the in the time of the Exodus, you all would remember the story. They could have had the blood on the eve of the Exodus. How many of you know they could have had the blood? They could have slain the lamb. &gt;&gt; They could have drained the blood into a bucket. They had the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; They could have been walking around with the blood. &gt;&gt; But having the revelation of the blood was not going to save them. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? Many churches have the revelation of the blood. Yes, &gt;&gt; they know that Christ shed his blood for them. &gt;&gt; But hauling the blood and walking around with the blood on the bucket was not what was the requirement for that day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The location and the application of the blood was important. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The death angel would have slain every firstborn if the blood was not applied correctly. &gt;&gt; Amen. They couldn't have waved the their blood to their death angel and say, "Look, I got the blood." But did you apply the blood? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Did you apply the blood? I know the message. I believe the message. Did you apply the message? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read Exodus 12 for those that don't read. Exodus 12. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats, and you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month. And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And they shall take the blood and strike it upon the true sidepost and upon the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat. &gt;&gt; Very specific. &gt;&gt; Where the blood must be applied. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. upon the two side posts and upon the upper doorpost. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire and unleven bread, and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of it raw, nor soden at all with water, but roast with fire. Have a nice bri with it. Roast it with fire. Amen. His head and his legs. see some sheep head and legs and with pertinence thereof. And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning. And that which remained of it until the morning, you shall burn with fire. &gt;&gt; Thus shall you eat it with your loins good, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand. What is it? Ready to move out. &gt;&gt; Shoes on your feet, loins good, staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. &gt;&gt; The message is urgent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Soon cometh the body change. Eat the word with haste. &gt;&gt; Prepare with haste. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For soon cometh our king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It is the Lord's Passover. For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and smite all the firstborn in the land, both man and beast. And against all the gods of Egypt, I will execute judgment. I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood &gt;&gt; I will pass over you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt. Amen. Hallelujah. So what we are trying to establish there where the blood was applied was very important. &gt;&gt; And right now we know the prophet teaches us. Amen. This is one of the mysteries. Amen. that it wasn't just the literal blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, but the life that was in the blood has come upon the believer. And because the life has come upon the believer, when the death angel is coming now through the latest and age, amen, he's going to pass over you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the life of Christ is found in you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; now if we start practicing the message, we're going to find the results follow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If people are saying there's nothing happening the message, we can't see any. No, you are not practicing the word of God. &gt;&gt; This message is a powerful word. Amen. This is a third power in this message. &gt;&gt; Power to create the spoken word. Power. Amen. Hallelujah. To change things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says now many people just call it the word. The word is right. But the signs follow the word. &gt;&gt; Paul said the gospel came to us something like this. Not only in word only, but through the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. I ask you to challenge ministers in this hour. Tell them, don't only give me the word only, but show me the word in power and show me the word in demonstration. Let me see the God that you serve. Are you just a parrot repeating things? Or do you know this God that you're talking about? Have you had a backside experience? Amen. Experience in the backside of the desert. Do you know this God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring the trouble. &gt;&gt; Bring the blind. &gt;&gt; Bring the sick. And let's see the power of the gospel. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have a mult showdown. Let's root out all unbelief in the message. Amen. Hiding behind quotes. Hiding behind religion. Hiding behind the church. Let's see God on display. Let's see Hebrews 38 again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Free to operate the word. People have many skills. Amen. People are free to the word. &gt;&gt; People have faith to intellectually represent the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. But free to operate the word. can say I didn't come with word only but I came with power and I came with demonstration. Amen. The Holy Ghost is here this morning to bring power to bring demonstration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now to prove that's what he was speaking of. Listen. Amen. Now he's quoting Mark 16. These signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; So it takes beyond believing. &gt;&gt; Signs must follow the believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Otherwise, quit saying that you believe. You are bringing a reproach to the gospel. If signs don't follow you, approach to the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to fake unbelief. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch. In my name, they action. Now, you must go into action. You must apply. They shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not just believing cast out devils. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody must go there. That's right. &gt;&gt; A son of God who has authority on the earth. Do you know you control atmospheres? You control. You control the atmosphere of the earth. No demon power want to be able to overpower you because you're a son and daughter of God on the earth right now. You are to take control of principalities of powers of every demon spirit. Amen. And speak to it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; They shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. All of these things require something that you do as a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They shall drink any deadly thing. It shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Amen. Free to apply the word. Don't be scared to apply the word. Amen. It's God's word. God has to back up his own word. You are just a believer in the word who needs to apply the word. Somebody give God praise. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God says, "But God never place signs ahead of the word." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Signs follow the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not a bunch of signing people that just go looking for signs. No, we have established ourself in the word. We stand on the word. Amen. On Christ's solid rock, I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. So signs must follow the word. As when Elijah told the woman to bake the cake first, according to the word of the Lord. Now when she did as the word said, the proper sign came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come to the word first, then watch the miracle. &gt;&gt; Come to the word first, then watch your situation change. &gt;&gt; Come Amen. Examine the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come to the word first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then watch the miracle in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come to the word first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seed word is energized by the spirit. &gt;&gt; That is as good as saying the dynamics are coming upon the mechanics. &gt;&gt; The seed word is energized by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Negativity back. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Seek and you shall find. Some of you are only seeking negative things. &gt;&gt; Some of you are seeking counsel from unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Where are you getting counsel from? Some people's counselors are &gt;&gt; Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; Some people's counsel are Dr. Google. &gt;&gt; Amen. Since when did God place Tik Tok and Google above his word? &gt;&gt; Show me where you're getting your counsel from. &gt;&gt; Show me where you're getting the word from. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Change your confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, how come how come Lord we are not I don't have the faith to apply the word. Well, what are you feeding on day and night?

No, you are being changed into their image &gt;&gt; because that's what you are feeding on. You are being changed into a worldly image &gt;&gt; because what you feed on that's what you're becoming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Change your confession. &gt;&gt; You only live as high as your confession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Change your confession. If you are sick, never confess that you are sick. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; thank you. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lucky I didn't wear gloves this morning. &gt;&gt; If you are sick, change your confession. &gt;&gt; The prophet told John Ryan, "Go on your way believing &gt;&gt; and keep confessing. &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; You know, he came back the next day or so and he said nothing happened. The prophet rebuked him. &gt;&gt; He says, "The vision never lies." &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't care how long it takes. You keep confessing, praise God, I'm healed. Praise God I'm healed. &gt;&gt; This man had a paper business. Amen. That he was selling newspaper and he should go around saying extra extra read all about it.

The next day you're going to receive even worse symptoms. Even worse news. Amen. You're going to receive worse news than before. &gt;&gt; You're going to get threatened on your job. You're going to be told this, that, and the other. But God wants to see your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing the fire did to the three Hebrew boys was loose the bands.

But I want you to put a digit in front of it and don't put a digit of zero in front of it. start to put a one or start to put a two or start to put a three or how much you can imagine to see there and start to work and believe that God is able to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you think I'm lying. The Lord said if Etsy right and asked for a million dollars, the Lord would have given her a million dollars. Don't ask me where it would have come from, but a million dollars would have been there in that home that day. I say he's the same yesterday. I say he's the same today. I say he's the same forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What we need to take is shake our feet a little bit and get rid of some unbelief here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We put the limits of God on God.

But God's word says all things are possible to believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Seeing a dead church, seeing a a lukewarm church. Amen. Because people don't afraid to apply the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. Seeing a stiff neck, we believe the word, brother. We have the opening of the word.

Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Don't limit yourself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We put limits on ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you know there's nothing wrong with with progressing in life? &gt;&gt; As long as your heart doesn't turn away from God. &gt;&gt; The problem with Solomon, he asked for wisdom, &gt;&gt; but God blessed him in material things, &gt;&gt; but he didn't stay there. His heart turned away from the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God will bless you. &gt;&gt; God will bless you in your finances. God will bless you. Amen. Whatever your desires are if you can apply your mind and walk towards it. &gt;&gt; It's not going to fall from heaven.

You know what that bomber does? &gt;&gt; That bomber can go into territories undetected. &gt;&gt; No radar can detect it. &gt;&gt; That's what they did recently. &gt;&gt; They went in, they bombed, and they came out. &gt;&gt; What I'm describing is your prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your prayer infiltrates places &gt;&gt; that you can't even get into. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It goes undetected by the enemy. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And it brings your lost loved one back. &gt;&gt; It brings your job back. &gt;&gt; It brings whatever you're praying for back. &gt;&gt; Prayer shakes heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know prayer is so powerful? It can change the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's Hezekiah as an example. &gt;&gt; There's Nineveh as an example. &gt;&gt; There's Aab as an example. &gt;&gt; They all walked softly before the Lord. They changed. They repented. And God in his longsuffering, &gt;&gt; he said, "I won't bring judgment in your time. I'll bring it upon the next nation." &gt;&gt; Prayer can change things. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so so even military exercises, they they have military application. Every product must go through testing, &gt;&gt; a period of testing and development phase before it can be sold to the public. Why? Because the manufacturer, they're not concerned so much about you. They want to have a product that they can have confidence in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The manufacturer wants to produce a product that will be able to sustain itself. They're not going to get a whole lot of comebacks all the time &gt;&gt; and they're going to get buyer confidence in this product. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the manufacturer wants to have confidence in its product. So what it does now to attract you as a buyer, they attach a warranty or a guarantee to their product. And the warranty and guarantee is showing us that the manufacturer has confidence towards its own product. And the warranty is there to protect the reputation of the manufacturer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you know that? &gt;&gt; It's there to protect the reputation of the manufacturer. &gt;&gt; Because rather than you go on broadcast that this is a bad product, they tell you within 6 months or a year, bring it back to us. We'll repay it for free. Don't put it out there in the public. You and I, we can sort this out. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Some Christians are like that. The prophet says, "Science tell you to go take this pill. It doesn't work." Do you know there are many doctors who misdiagnose? &gt;&gt; They treat you for stuff you don't even have. &gt;&gt; He says they give you the wrong pill. You take that pill. After 6 months, the doctor says, "You know what? We misdiagnosed you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I was just reading. Amen. There was a story of this woman that that do they misdiagnosed her having cancer, put her through chemotherapy and all of these things only to find out years later she never had cancer. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Medical malpractice. And people don't lose confidence in science. They go back to another doctor. They say, "Can I have a second opinion?" &gt;&gt; But when it comes to the word of God, you apply the word, nothing happens. People lose confidence. Ah, nothing happened. Brother Brandham says, "If the Lord told me to go pray for the sick," and he says, "If that person died," he says, "I'll go back the next morning preaching that Jesus Christ still heals a sick." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't lose confidence in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Just because you had a bad experience in life or a bad situation happened, you shouldn't lose confidence in the word of God because the word of God is a sure foundation. The word of God can get you out of any situation. The word of God can get you out of depression, out of trauma, out of any situation that you've been in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ, Amen. Just like a manufacturer gives us a guarantee and a warranty. Amen. Jesus Christ also gives us a guarantee in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he also has confidence in his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says if you believe his word and apply it by faith, he guarantees you in Mark 9:23 that all things are possible to them that believe. That's the manufacturer of your own body. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the greatest manufacturer. &gt;&gt; He says if you can believe &gt;&gt; all things are possible. I'm giving you this guarantee. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know the angel of the Lord told the prophet, "If you get the people to believe you, &gt;&gt; not even cancer, &gt;&gt; not even cancer will stand in your way. &gt;&gt; That's a guarantee." &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; That's a guarantee. Even if you if you have faith to believe me, he says, "Not even cancer will be able to stand in your way." &gt;&gt; So what is your situation? What is your problem? If you believe, nothing shall stand in your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God will defeat Satan anytime, anywhere, any place, in every circumstance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, do you know that this year? Amen. This, how many of you know what this is? What is this? Nobody knows what this is. This is a prison phone. &gt;&gt; I'm just using another word for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's called a cell phone, but it holds you prisoner. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can hold you prisoner for hours. Some of you don't like to be in prison. &gt;&gt; Some of you never like detention. 1 hour detention. Now this thing puts you in detention. You will sit and you will look at me and you will scroll. 1 hour gone, &gt;&gt; 2 hours gone. &gt;&gt; Then they knock you on the door in the toilet. Come out. &gt;&gt; Prison phone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, do you know that this phone in order for it to work, it needs applications? If I took out all the applications from your phone, your phone will be useless. &gt;&gt; What you going to do with it? Make phone calls. Hello. People very shy. They act like they don't have phones. They got their head down now. We don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing a point to you. &gt;&gt; Without applications, this phone becomes useless. &gt;&gt; Even the manufacturer puts an operating software in here &gt;&gt; in order for you to start to download applications. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So without the operating software, your phone is useless and applications and software needs to be updated all the time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In order to keep up with the latest version, why latest version? Your phone won't run at optimal levels? Because the software and the application is always receiving upgrades &gt;&gt; to fix bugs, &gt;&gt; to fix problems. Now, if you got an outdated version, your problem won't be fixed. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have the latest phone, but an old application. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing a point with this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can have the latest phone. You can be living in 2025 with Luther's message. &gt;&gt; Updated version. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; App has been upgraded. It'll tell you, "Please update your app." &gt;&gt; Do you want to update your app or continue using it? The Lutherans press continue using. [Music] &gt;&gt; Same thing with the Wesians. &gt;&gt; Do you want to update the app? Continue using. &gt;&gt; The Pentecostals. Do you want to update the app? No. Continue using. &gt;&gt; So, they have all kinds of bugs. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And errors in their doctrine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they haven't updated to the latest version. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The update fixes bugs and issu and problems. Amen. The previous versions may have had. The update also introduces new features. &gt;&gt; If you go look at the first version of uh WhatsApp, it didn't have so much of features like you have now. &gt;&gt; So the update also provides new features &gt;&gt; and new functions. They are always improving on the applications. &gt;&gt; So I'm saying stay up to date. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even with what the spirit is doing, stay up to date with what the spirit is saying to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even as you heard last week and even our brother Sunonny was confirming. Amen. After the service, the things that they knew and understood back when they first came in the message, the revelation has progressed. &gt;&gt; So what happens if we stay with just the revelation they had back then in the 80s? in the '90s, we'll be having an outdated version. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But we need to come now into 2025 where God is opening up his word even more clearly so that we can have the latest &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; download from the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Stay up to date. Amen. Hallelujah. We have had the revealing of the word, but now is not the time of the revealing of the word. You can't tell me we're living in the time when the word is being revealed. The word has already been revealed. Now is the time and season where we are manifesting the word. &gt;&gt; Living out our part of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I ask you if Moses was the promised word of his day and Noah was the promised word of his day and Enoch was the promised word of his day. Elijah was the promised word of his day and I can take you through Paul, Arinius, Martin, Columbus, Luther, Wesley and Brandham was the promised word of their day. I ask you where is the promised word of this day? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, who is the promised word of today? &gt;&gt; Show me the promised word of today. &gt;&gt; I want to see the promised word of today. And you can't show me a book. The Amen. The promised word was always revealed in a person of Paul. Was always revealed in the person of Ireneius. Was revealed in the person of Brandham. Show me the promised word of today made flesh in you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; let's put up the next word, brother. Amen. Hear what he says. God stands on the promised word of for each new year. &gt;&gt; This is not 2024. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This is 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God stands on the promised word for each new year. He stands on it this year. &gt;&gt; To fulfill what he has got promised for this year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on people of God. God has promises for you for this year, but you are still trying to mine yesterday's promises. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we reading this? Do we believe this is shalom 1964? He's saying God stands on the promised word for each new year. &gt;&gt; He stands on it. So my expectation for 26 is far greater than what for 2025 if the Lord carries. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, I want to be right in the center of his will in the future like David. So for 2026, I want to be right in the center of his will. Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ living in you. Watch now how the prophet brings us makes him the center of your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the key to understanding God's revelation, the Bible reveals Christ. And when Christ lives in you, your life becomes the full expression of God's purpose. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know it was Christ in Moses? &gt;&gt; What made Moses the Christ? &gt;&gt; It was God in him. &gt;&gt; What made Brandham the Christ? God in him. &gt;&gt; Now, wherever Christ is, wherever the anointing is, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; that becomes the central theme. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham is trying to say in Christ the mystery. We become the central theme. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just go to the next one there, brother. Where the quote is Christ the mystery of God revealed 233 there. Listen to what he's saying now. Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation. Christ lives in you makes him the center of the revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Christ, now watch what he's saying. Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. So wherever Christ is being revealed, that becomes a central theme. &gt;&gt; Everyone catching this. I'm going to close now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the next 1 hour, &gt;&gt; everyone catching this. &gt;&gt; Wherever Christ is, it becomes the central theme. &gt;&gt; Moses was a central theme for his day. &gt;&gt; Noah was a central theme for his day. &gt;&gt; So I'm asking you, where is Christ in this day? &gt;&gt; Because wherever Christ is, that becomes the central theme. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's saying Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. See what God is trying to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when when you're reading Revelation 10:7, the mystery of God being revealed, Christ is revealing you because Christ is in you. You become the central theme of the revelation now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you know that redemption's plan can't move forward without you? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. Redemption's plan can't move forward without you. Everything in heaven and earth is depending upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We in the body of Christ also have an operating software. It's Amen. It's God's operating software. It's called the blessed Holy Spirit. Amen. The Holy Ghost was sent to keep our app always updated. &gt;&gt; He says, Amen. We can read a few, amen, of these scriptures. The comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, of whom the father will send in my name. He shall teach you all things, bring all things to your remembrance. Whatsoever I have said unto you, peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. Oh, people are are troubled in their mind. But Jesus said, I'm leaving peace with you back then. And peace has never left the earth. Amen. For the believer, whoever is in Christ remains in peace. Whoever is in Christ remains in shalom. So you can't tell me that you are troubled. You are depressed. Which means you got out of Christ. Jesus is saying peace I leave with you. &gt;&gt; Jesus never took peace from the lives of the believer. Some people are saying I have no peace in my life. Then you left Jesus. &gt;&gt; Call Jesus back into your life because Jesus is saying peace I leave with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Not as the world giveth. The world gives but it wants to take it back. He's saying no. Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid. Amen. John 16. I'm just trying to read the scriptures to show you the app that came for you. The Holy Ghost. Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart, I will send him unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he is come, he watch what the Holy Ghost app is going to do now. He will rebuke of the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment. Of sin because they believe not on me. Of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more. of judgment because the prince of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. How be it, when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; He shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will show you of things to come. He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and show it unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to another scripture in Acts 18. When this app is coming, when this Holy Ghost application is coming, you shall receive power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is bringing power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 1:13. In whom you also trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. In whom also after you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession and to the praise of his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. What else can this app do, brother? What else can this Holy Ghost do for me? Romans 8:1. Amen. Now, it says there is therefore now no condemnation. You know what that means? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It means the case is dismissed. &gt;&gt; It means the judges are dropped. Amen. Hallelujah. The the judge is throwing this case out of court. He's saying there's now no more condemnation. You prosecutor who's bringing an Amen. who's bringing an accusation. Your case is null and void. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We have examined your evidence. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And there's no condemnation &gt;&gt; to them which are in Christ Jesus, &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh, but after this application called the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Verse four, for as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. You have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption. So this application also brings me to adoption. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Whereby you cry aba father, the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you are children and ears of God, joints with Christ, he so be that you suffer with him, you also may be glorified together. &gt;&gt; Amen. What did the Holy Ghost come to do? To make us sons and daughters of God again. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are to recognize who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to speak what we believe. &gt;&gt; Come on. The word didn't come in this hour to make us mute. The word came that spoken word is the original seed and the spoken word must come out of your mouth. Put up Romans 4:17 there. As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations before him who believed. Even God, watch how God speaks now. Who quicken the dead and call those things which were not, which be not as though they were. Amen. &gt;&gt; If God spoke that way, calling those things which are not as though they were, the ones that are created in his image and likeness must speak the same way. Must speak those things which are not as though they were. I don't care if your son or daughter is as sick as sick can be. You speak it as though they are already healed. Amen. Hallelujah. There is no sickness, no disease that is not covered by the stripes of Jesus. Amen. There's no new sickness that can come upon the earth that can evade the blood of Jesus and the stripes of Jesus. Every sickness was paid for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 10:8. I'm teaching you how to speak now. Amen. What say he? The word is nye where in the books. No, &gt;&gt; the word is neither even where in thy mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with your mouth? Speak. &gt;&gt; And in thy heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. That is the word of faith which we preach that if you confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shall believe in thine heart that God had raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture said whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. Proverbs 18:21 says death and life are in the power of the nose &gt;&gt; are in the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people the only power of the tongue they have is to taste &gt;&gt; taste. &gt;&gt; Only when they eat eat but taste gone. &gt;&gt; Use your tongue for something else. &gt;&gt; Use your tongue to speak. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Come on church. &gt;&gt; Use your tongue to speak. &gt;&gt; We are speaking of faith must be applied. &gt;&gt; Free to apply the word. &gt;&gt; Death and life are in the power of the tongue. And watch what it goes on to say. They that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. Now what in case you love death, you're going to eat the fruit of death. What in case you you love negativity? You are going to eat the fruit of negativity. &gt;&gt; I'm always sick. I'm always depressed. I'm always nothing. Nothing. Nothing. You're going to eat that fruit. &gt;&gt; But if you love life. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Are you reading the scripture properly? &gt;&gt; What will you love? Death or life? &gt;&gt; If you are going to love life, you are going to eat the fruit of life. &gt;&gt; We all know the scripture Mark 11:23. When these disciples see Jesus speak to that tree, curse it and it hithered away. They wanted to know how did you speak to that tree? How come you are operating like Adam operated? &gt;&gt; Give us the key. Jesus tells them the key now. Whosoever shall say to this mountain, are you going to pray in that time? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not your time to pray. &gt;&gt; That's the time for you to stand there as a son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Joshua with the sun was going down, he didn't say, "Hold on, hold on. I'm going to have a prayer meeting." You already ought to be prayed up, you already ought to be on fire for God. So when the situation arise, you can stand there and say, "Son, stand still and moon, you stay there in that valley." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't have time to pray there. The Bible says if you say not if you pray &gt;&gt; if you say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he say shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith &gt;&gt; when Jesus went to James he didn't start to pray he said daughter arise so your prayer life must already be in place &gt;&gt; you must already have connection with the father amen you must already have connection with the divine supernatural power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Afraid to apply the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not when you arrive in situation. Lord, forgive me all my trespass. Lord, forgive me, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; what's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Speak Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How are we going to operate as sons of God if we keep &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know it paralyzed the prophet's faith once? &gt;&gt; Yeah. He told a white lie. He said, "Tell them I'm not in." He stepped out the house. &gt;&gt; He couldn't pray for the child. &gt;&gt; Could he speak then? &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you a practical example. &gt;&gt; He couldn't pray for the baby. &gt;&gt; He had to go now and pray. &gt;&gt; I'm saying what's happening with sons and daughters of God. When we put in a situation, Lord, forgive me. Lord Jesus, Father, oh, I'm so sorry, Lord, because now you know your life is messed up, but the situation requires you for to speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Speak. If you speak with your mouth, be removed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Believe those things which you said coming out of your own mouth. You got to believe the words coming out of your mouth. He shall have whatsoever he said. Amen. What you going to do when you're diagnosed with a sickness? Are you going to curl up in a corner and die? Or you going to take God's word and apply it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're going to say 1 Peter 2:24 &gt;&gt; as Jesus bore my sins on the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; By whose stripes I am healed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Here what the prophet is saying. He says, "You men and women of tomorrow." Now, he's preaching this in 65. So, I'll say we are the men and women of tomorrow. &gt;&gt; He says, "You men and women of tomorrow, if there is a tomorrow, you will be there in 2025, &gt;&gt; God is depending on you." &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, "God is depending on you." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. He says in the next message, the sweetest words in the Bible, father, I sanctify myself that I might sanctify them. What was he trying to do? Set an example. &gt;&gt; So if Jesus sanctified himself for the people, we are to sanctify ourselves for the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. He was sending 12 men out with the gospel that would conquer the world. He's depending on you and I to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he could sanctify himself like that, why ought we to set aside every failure, every doubt, and everything else and sanctify ourselves? For we are the seed of Abraham through him, that we are more than conquerors through him. Go into all the world and demonstrate the power of the resurrection. He's not dead, but he's alive, and he's depending on you and I to let him work through us to will his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, devils never die. Devils always live but there will be a time when devils will have to die. They will become totally annihilated. But now they are alive. They walk from generation to generation upon human beings. Some of them in the form of cancer. &gt;&gt; Watch. I'm closing with this now. I'm going to bring the main point of the message. Now is everybody take a deep breath. Let oxygen get to your brain. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. The main point of the message is to show you you are the central theme right now. &gt;&gt; You become the most important figure right now. &gt;&gt; I'm going to prove it with quotes and the scriptures. &gt;&gt; They work from generation to generation. So demon powers have trouble generation to generation in your family. It's time for you to stop it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They work from generation to generation upon human beings. Some of them in the form of cancer. Some in the form of epilepsy. Some in the form of tuberculosis they get into the flesh &gt;&gt; but seemingly they are powerless until they can get into a person. &gt;&gt; This is the point I'm going to drive now. &gt;&gt; Everything is hinging upon you the person. &gt;&gt; Demon powers need to get into a person. &gt;&gt; They have to operate through a person which brings another thought that the Holy Spirit covers the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's almost helpless. until it can get into you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, who can make the Holy Ghost powerless? &gt;&gt; You and I. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost don't have a body to tabernacle, the Holy Ghost becomes powerless. &gt;&gt; Hey, some of you act like you're not reading with me here. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying there's a prophet saying it. &gt;&gt; He says, "Amen. The Holy Spirit covers the earth and he's almost helpless until it can get into you and me." Amen. &gt;&gt; God is depending on you and I. The Holy Spirit, the earth is full of the spirit of God, but it's poured out. It cannot operate. It cannot operate. The Holy Spirit cannot operate until it comes into us. We human beings to operate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So which means are you trying to tell me that the Holy Ghost becomes a personified person? And devil wants to take us over to operate under him. So when he gets a mild form, he starts to sin. If you can just get a hold him, just a righteous man, a good man, and just let him go ahead and try to be good like that. If you can hold him like that until he's dead, that's just what he wants to do. He's got him. Because no matter how righteous you are, good you are, how moral you are, how clean you are, how honest you are, you will never get to heaven until you are born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So from that quote I want you to take two things. Heaven is depending on you. &gt;&gt; Demon powers are depending on you. &gt;&gt; Everyone establish that in their quote. &gt;&gt; So heavens and earth are depending on you. Holy Ghost and demon powers are depending on you trying to get access to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read the Bible and see. Maybe there's some other people depending upon us. Hebrews 14. Amen. Hebrews 11:40. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. &gt;&gt; Why? What are you talking about now? You're putting too much pressure on me. Heaven is depending on me. Demon powers are depending on me.
