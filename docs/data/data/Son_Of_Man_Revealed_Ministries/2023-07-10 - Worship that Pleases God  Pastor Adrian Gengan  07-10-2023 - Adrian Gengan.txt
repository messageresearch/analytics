you may be seated at this time amen hallelujah amen you bless the ours of the Lord amen amen we're going to get into the dedication amen uh of Judah and I just wanted to share a testimony um before we get into that a few weeks back I told you I had some testimonies but I was saving it amen so amen firstly just say we know that the Lord has been working in a certain way this season you know especially in in the local assembly we know amen how the Lord has been leading us how the Lord has been revealing to us this year how God wants to move in the year 2023 amen and how the angel of the Lord is tied with the number 23 amen amen and we've seen it through so many testimonies that number 23 appearing not only the mathematics but also the the Vindication the supernatural Vindication of it amen it's one thing just to see God in numerics in the Bible but then it's another thing when the manifestation unfolds amen so we like to thank God firstly for showing us in the season where we are at and then we can recognize our day and its message amen because our day and its message doesn't stop in 1963 amen but it's present time amen so you would also know that during the course of the year Pastor aan also mentioned a few times that it's no coincidence that Judah is coming this year because the word Judah is Ted uh the word praise and and our worship is tied in with our Victory and it's tied in with the angel of the Lord and everything is tied into that amen and I want to show you through my testimony how true that has become amen it wasn't just word spoken by a pastor but I want to show you how true that has become you know when we were were first expecting our first child Kim and I thought that we were going to have a boy and we already had the name Judah uh in advance before we knew that shikina was coming on the scene and when I was thinking about this testimony and I thought now I know the reason why Jud to come this year because it to tie in with the season now not that there's anything special about uh our son or us or anything but God does things like that he he just does thing he types things just to show us what season he's he's moving in so you would know that um a few weeks back before uh Judah was born that we had a prayer line in the church and we shared with you in fact we didn't share this with anyone else not even with our parents we only shared it with the church and the only reason why I shared it on that particular day was if youd remember the service the angel of the Lord was present amen there was such an anointing in the place amen no one asked Pastor Adrian to call a prayer line in that day but the angel of the Lord knew the needs and the angel of the Lord was present and I felt led on that day to say to the church what our our need was and that was that in the last few weeks leading after to Judah being born the gynecologist advise us that there seems to be something wrong and that the baby is not growing anymore I think at that stage uh he was around 2 kg and they say that after giving birth you actually drop in weight because of all the water and stuff so if you're under 2 kg they usually want to keep you in hospital and want to keep the baby in all of these machines and and and things like that so we wanted to trust God that the baby's weight would increase and that whatever was causing the the growth problem that God would make away and so you know that we gave the request in the church and Kim was laid hands on and she was prayed for we can canell the report of the doctor a week after that on the Saturday we went for our gynecologist visit this was a week after the Sunday that we prayed and from 2 kg the baby barely grew still the baby was only around 2.1 just under 2.2 and the doctor at that stage once again told us that look you know if when the baby is born they usually drop in weight and drop in size so that was the Saturday and the next day was Sunday and the Monday was when Judah was born so in the space of one day you know God comes in in the last minute because we H we didn't doubt we didn't cause fear to get into us we knew that the church prayed we knew that we prayed and we held on to our confession even though there was only one day left to make such an advancement in growth now usually babies grow about they say about in the last stages sometimes 3 to 500 GRS in a week we only had one day left but we trusted God nevertheless and on Monday when Kim went into labor um we we were getting close to the time that she was to give birth and the baby began to be in distress and the nurses began to call the gynecologist because she was still on her way to the hospital and she said you know what baby's in distress and the heart rate is dropping and they started talking about an emergency C-section and so as time went on the time was getting um too advanced now so they got came ready to go into the C-section room into the the the operating theater and so whilst they took her down I was still getting some stuff from upstairs and I was coming down the elevator and I said God when when I get there when the when the gynecologist comes she must just say we doing this as a normal birth am amen now bearing in mind that they already rash came to to get it ready ready for theater they've already got the the the surgeons and the anesthesist and all ready to perform this they were just waiting for the gynecologist but that's what I spoke and when I went down we are still waiting for the gynecologist and they kept on getting everyone ready for the C-section when the gynecologist walked in she looked at Kim and she's and she just told Kim Kim just try and push this baby out let's do it normal but we don't have to do a S let let's let's try and get this baby out and that was exactly what I spoke that when the gynecologist comes she just say let's do a normal birth bear in mind that everyone else was already ready to do the c section and they were all standing on guard ready to do the emergency C-section but there and there the baby was born uh bya normal birth but now here is where on a tie in Mark 11:23 three and the angel of the Lord because like I said we can see God in numerics but we're going to see the manifestation now Mark 11:23 says speak to the mountain and it shall be moved now right then and there I spoke and it happened as though as I spoke now baby was born when they recorded the time of baby's birth it was 11:29 so if you look back to see the time when the gynecologist walked in and said let's not do a C-section let's do a normal BOS 11:23 amen Judah is the 23rd grandson of my granny great grandson of my granny he has he has uh born uh at 11 well 11:23 I told you he was the 23rd grandson we know that the he was born at the 11th Hour as well at 11:00 11th is the 23rd is the same as the 23rd it types the 23rd hour and so then baby was born right and when baby was was born they weighed the baby now bearing in mind 2 days ago the baby was only 2.2 or less than 2.2 when they weighed the baby is [Music] 2.72 that is around 500 to 700 Grand in the space of one day cuz God can come in at the last minute he answered the prayers of the Saints so why I'm telling you that also is to recognize that when the angel of the Lord is here know that he's doing things and we've seen that even in the last few weeks people getting healed in service just with the preaching of the word so the angel of the Lord is here moving and you you remember that the quote Pastor read that sometimes he visits you during the course of the week you might pray here on the Sunday but the angel of the Lord crosses your neighborhood during the course of the week so hold on when when you don't see an immediate result hold on yes amen so the baby weighed 2.72 and 2 + 7 + 2 gives you 11 which is the 11th Hour which starts the 23 amen so then after baby was born the the gynecologist left and the nurse uh was attending to the baby and the nurse said you know she's not happy because the baby is is gruning a lot struggling for air and she just said you know she's not happy she's going to call the pediatrician or the doctor immediately so she just stepped out of the room and I just I was standing next to Sister Kim and I said you know what don't worry I went over to the baby and I didn't pray I said Judah you're the son of the most high God now let your lungs breathe in Jesus name something along those lines and literally a second or two seconds the nurse walked back behind me and looked at the baby and she said how now everything is normal with the baby so that is Mark 11:23 now the manifestation of it amen amen not praying but speaking the word amen amen so we like to thank the Lord for that also you know sometimes we always say death and life life that the power of our tongue and you know Kim was talking to sister Vanessa before baby was born and she said you know babies are so Advanced these days that they'll come out your teeth and Judah was born with a tooth which is a rare thing amen so there's there's so much to thank God for amen and if we can only recognize the angel of the Lord working in our midst amen and and sometimes we just got to be vigilant and you know we've been saying that the that in order for the supernatural to happen God has to present the opportunity you can't expect to do the supernatural if there's no sickness if there's no problem if there's no trial if there's no mountain so sometimes when it happens you might ask yourself but why why but God is telling you why he wants you to manifest but he can only manifest it if the situation is there amen Jesus could only calm the storm if the storm was there amen so we like to thank the church for train and believing and we know that God is moving in our midst amen so I like to give the Lord than thanks for Judah for a safe delivery for good health amen we know that the Lord Has His blessings upon us amen we like to call our pastor aent at this time amen let's just sing one chorus even as we call him let's sing only [Music] believe [Music] oh only believe that all things are sing only believe only really [Music] oh that all things are [Music] POS all let's say now I believe [Music] now now my amen hallelujah [Music] all and now believe now I [Music] believe I Hallelujah now [Music] I that all things everything is possible [Music] amen amen we you on in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah it's good to be back in the house of the Lord to worship Him amen good to be found with Believers of like Precious Faith you know it takes if I gathered alone here there's no promise that he would come here but the Bible says where two or more are gathered together in my name there I will be in the midst amen amen so aren't you glad you can come into the house of the the Lord to worship Him amen let's give the Lord some good an of praise and some life amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so amen it's a good day to be in church and worship Him amen and the Bible says that they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen we can come in many other ways and attitudes but it must be in spirit and Truth otherwise it is not received you find that there are many people worshiping today amen many forms of worship are going forth but the question is is God receiving the worship am amen so amen we just like to welcome every one of you in the house of the Lord amen and we have uh visiting with us the grandparents of Judah amen praise the lord we have uh brother Moses sister Rachel let's give them a hand and welcome them amen amen we have brother Mark and sister castrell that's uh sister Kim's mom and dad let's give them a hand amen welcome in the house of the Lord pray be blessed in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah so just want to move to the uh dedication then we can get into the word of the Lord amen hallelujah if we can put up Psalm 127 verse3 amen Psalm 127 and ver3 says children are indeed a Heritage from the Lord and the fruit of the whom is his reward like arrows in the hand of a warrior so are children born in one's youth blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them now brother jaff two is not full unless you have a small quiver amen hallelujah blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them he shall not be put to shame when he confronts the enemies at the gate amen so this is the bless guing this is the heritage of the Lord and we see that God was not satisfied with Abram not having children it was his desire for him to have children and he changes his name and he calls him father of many nations amen amen so praise the Lord then we want to go to Mark 10 and verse 13 we'll read from verse 13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God Amen verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and he blessed them amen amen we find here I just want to speak a little bit maybe for a minute or two on Judah and show you the importance of Judah amen so we find that Judah was born to Rachel in Genesis 29:35 amen Genesis 29:35 says and she conceived again and bear a son and she said now I will praise the Lord amen amen now I will praise the Lord there therefore she called his name Judah or in the Hebrew it's called Yehuda amen praise the Lord so we know that Judah means praise amen hallelujah and God loves to be praised and worshiped amen amen in fact the very uh meaning of God is an object of worship so God was Desiring to have worship amen and out outside of the angels He so with the angels He had one form of worship but it was not Redemptive worship they could not worship him out of redemption because they had never experienced Redemption yes they had never experienced the other attributes of God that's why they will say holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty amen they saw the Holiness of God In fact when you get into the throne room of Revelation 4 you'll see the worship is one way but Revelation 5 changes the theme the worship changes amen hallelujah so we find here that God has a desire for us to worship Him and we are meeting the desire at this time amen amen come on now you and I are meeting his desire of Worship the Lord says there'll come a time when true worshippers will arise we are fulfilling that part right now amen so God God had to decide I we will come the first time amen he says I'm coming to Earth I'm I'm coming from Spirit to flesh but I'm deciding out to come come on now and if he came a certain way the first time he's got to come the same way the second time amen because God is Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah amen and how did he come the first time there were 12 tribes but he chose One Tribe to come by amen amen hallelujah amen there were 12 tribes but he chose One Tribe and he said through the tribe of Judah through the tribe of Praise I will come amen amen hallelujah oh yes so he inhabits the Praises of his people as Psalm 150:6 tells us so Jesus comes when we start to praise Him amen amen amen so he was born through the tribe of Judah amen so the tribe of Judah you know the symbol is a lion amen hallelujah so if Judah or Yehuda means praise and the symbol is a lion then you can't Praise and Worship the Lord and PE like a cat oh yes that's right stop saying meow this morning and give the Lord a good raw of Praise amen hallelujah hallelujah amen we can't be saying that we are from now let me tell you something are we the married wife of the Lord Jesus Christ is he from the tribe of Judah we belong to the tribe of Judah and our praise must be loud yes Lord Praise amen you can't Worship the Lord quietly you can't praise His name quietly your praise must sound like a lion your amen must sound like a lion your Hallelujah must sound like a lion yes Lord amen hallelujah yes oh God Amen thank you Lord you find when Israel was moving and they were going to conquer a territory yes they were going to conquer a land amen there was a specific order that God ordered them to go amen hallelujah who was going to walk in front amen the tribe of Judah was put in front because that was a tribe of praise and they had to lead the worship amen amen it was the tribe of Judah that W led the walk around Jericho's walls thank you it was a tribe of Praise amen it was the king of Judah the king of Praise King josaphat who instructed the singers and the musicians to go before the Army in Praise amen hallelujah and you know what happened they won the battle and Jericho's walls came down I know it's two different times but you know what I mean amen now Satan trembles when you start to Worship the Lord yes amen amen Satan hates it when you Worship the Lord because Satan is wanting all your worship Satan is wanting your praise amen so when you start to praise the Lord devil starts to flee that's right amen amen and and if something something is wrong with you if you can't say an amen something is wrong with you amen if you can't say praise the Lord yes there's a spirit on you yes amen that's binding you but he whom the son of man is set free he's free indeed amen and Jesus said my word is truth and the truth shall set you free free to worship Him amen so you find when demons leave sickness leaves amen when demons leave diseases go amen hallelujah how through praise amen when you struggle to hear the Lord and you're feeling down and out and you're feeling amen low in your spirit amen just start to praise the Lord maybe you're in prison like Paul and Silas just start to praise the Lord maybe you're thrown into a fiery furnace just start to praise the Lord maybe you're thrown into a lion's den just start to praise the Lord praise is a key that unlocks yes the presence of God Amen Hallelujah amen if you don't feel him in your home if you don't feel him in your marriage if you don't feel him in your job if you don't feel him in your school I tell you turn up your praise let's have a church Quake amen hallelujah amen turn up your praise tell your wife tell your children come on let us start to sing and praise the Lord let us change the atmosphere yahudah is here amen amen amen hallelujah yes he will come down to your lowest situation he will come down to your lowest Valley amen praise the Lord oh Hallelujah let me remind you amen when when Daniel was thrown in the Lion's Den or Daniel was seeking the Lord remember for interpretation of the scripture demon powers obstructed the angel of the Lord from coming and it took 21 days before amen he received an answer amen but there's at a time when the three of boys the situation was different they couldn't wait 21 days they start to praise the Lord and confess amen so praise will bring now Daniel brought an angel to earth oh yes but the three Hebrew boys brought the F man in the fiery furnace brought God in on the scene hallelujah amen hallelujah depending what you want who you want to show up amen hallelujah so if you're struggling amen turn up some praise maybe you're in prison amen the tribe of Judah knows how to praise the Lord and they are Marching into Victory if you want promotion in your life amen praise the Lord if you want the victory in your life praise the Lord amen you want God to move in your business praise the Lord amen you want God to move in the school praise the Lord amen amen now you find your I'm going to close with this part now you find that Nomi was from Bethlehem you know a husband was from from Bethlehem but there wasn't any part of Bethlehem if you read Ruth there he says they were from Bethlehem Judah amen amen am a tribe that knew how to praise the Lord amen a tribe that doesn't amen I I see some stuttering this morning you know what I mean it's swinging you're getting that burst offer amen amen but amen we want to put that pill down amen hallelujah amen we want you not to just stutter with an amen you didn't hear me yet come on we are to worship God amen amen hallelujah

because nobody can open the seals there's nobody amen yet to open the seals but there's a the voice say John Don't You Weep there's one from the tribe of Judah Judah amen and he's worthy to open the seals so praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah and we know what happened amen the seals were open Revelation 10 was fulfilled down come the angel of the Lord with a open book in his hand

Lord amen hallelujah amen so don't think that we are an exclusive people that God is only working with us it's God's bride and he's got a many membered body bride amen amen so we are just being faithful and obedient to what God is calling us to do and God is shaping and molding the church around the world Amen there's a spiritual awakening there's a quickening amen that maybe you're not aware of but there's quickening and it's going to be a quick short work so I tell you the hour is urgent now's not the time to play around now is the time to get into the program of God Amen Hallelujah so Genesis 22 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold yeah I am and he said take now thy son thine only son son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee off amen so he tells him the location but the mountain is kept secret amen and Abraham rose up early in the morning and settled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him then on the third day very important on the third day so what were they doing for two days amen it says here on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto his young men abide here with the ass and I and the lad will go y and worship and come again to you now you just read the first time worship is mentioned in the bible amen now remember the Lord asked him to go and sacrifice Isaac and he's calling it worship am amen praise the Lord I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac's son so we can see this is not typ in Christ Christ with the cross on his back amen so he's got the wood on his back and he laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here am I my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering and abraam said my son God will provide a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together remember God never told him all of this you don't speak what you see you speak what you want amen you speak as a Son of God this is now showing us that Abraham had come to maturity so God can now put him through a test amen so remember a test is different from a Temptation Satan brings temptation to make us fall but a test anyone given a test why is it fall for you to pass the test a test is given not for you to fail a test is given to you to measure what you have learned amen hallelujah so we we have been through the chapters and showing you how Abraham was progressing and how he was moving from Faith to perfect faith and here you can see he is calling those things that are not as though they are yes amen amen he says God will provide himself of a lamb for a burnt offering and they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son amen Abraham means business amen Abraham is not just checking down waiting he pulls takes his knife and he's about to kill his son amen yes and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of Heaven amen so the supernatural world must now come and intervene because this man is serious amen amen hallelujah and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fear is God Amen seeing that thou has not withheld thy son so God is already seeing him that he has killed his son you have not withheld him from me you're willing to sacrifice him amen thine only son from me not your second son your only son amen amen amen and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a ticket of by his owns amen and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stad of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra amen amen as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou has done these things and has not with thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply LLY thy seed as the Stars which as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies amen and in the in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou as obey my voice amen amen praise the Lord amen just want to let's just go to another portion of scripture Amen in Hebrews chapter 11 amen Hebrews 11 and verse1 17 dealing with this now here the Apostle Paul is picking it up he says by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son here again confirming only begotten son amen are they lying no no amen William he's not lying so God is not considering the weakness of the flesh that was produced through Ager amen God is not considering the their unbelief stages God is not considering the past Hallelujah when God looks at you is not concerned about your past if it's under the blood thank you Lord amen praise the Lord God is looking at you the way he sees you amen thank you when God looks at you through the blood he sees you as perfect are you learning from this God is looking at Abraham and saying amen thy only begotten son of whom it is said that in Isaac thy seed Shall be Called accounting that God was able to raise him up can you see what faith Abraham had he said even if he killed him he knew that God was going to raise up Isaac yes amen this man believed in the resurrection of the dead amen amen even from the dead from when also he received him in a figure he knew that his his own body couldn't produce Isaac he knew that Sarah's whom was dead so he received him as one from the dead and if God could change their bodies it's not impossible for God to raise back Isaac yes Romans chap 4:1 17 amen Romans chapter 4:1 17 amen it says here as it is written aren't you glad it is written of us I will make thee a father of many nations am I reading correctly you mean without a son God is tell this you'll find in re in Genesis 17:5 where it is actually written I will make you a father of many Nation how is God speaking God is seeing it has already done I have made thee amen I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the what dead and what does God do calth those things which be not as though they were amen and then last portion of scripture in St John 4:23 amen yeah we find the Lord Jesus is speaking to the woman at the well and this woman has some perception she tells him I perceived thou a prophet amen amen maybe we'll read from verse 19 there the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou are a prophet now they're going to deal with worship our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet yet at Jerusalem worship the father 22 you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh that's verse 23 now the hour cometh amen I believe after 2,000 years the hour is here amen the hour cometh and now is when all when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him amen God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen father we pray you'll bless the reading of your word we thank you Lord that your word is Anointed your word is quick it's powerful it's sharp and I pray Lord that the angel of God will come and take the words now and bring it to life oh God we know father the let kill it but the spirit give it life oh God we come with the service into your hands in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen so we find here that Abraham is starting to speak like God remember when God started in Genesis with the first man you'll find here that Abraham you know there's a natural son there's a flesh son which is Ishmael right then there's a promised son which is Isaac and then there's a royal seed which is Jesus Christ amen hallelujah you'll find that all three wom if you go and look at it met the angel of the Lord AA when she left when she ran away from Sarah the angel of the Lord met her by the well amen hallelujah she was a woman at the well amen you'll find Rebecca another woman at the well and in John 4 you'll see a woman at the well amen and the angel of the Lord is coming to meet the woman at the well you know when the prophet dramatizes he also tells us that Mary was going to the well so there's something about God meeting women at the well amen so we find here there's three women there's AA there's Sarah and then there's Mary amen and all three of them have a visitation from the angel of the Lord and all three of them prophesy and say tell AGA you are going to have a son and his name Shall be Called ishmail tell Sarah you're going to have a son and his name Shall be Called Isaac tells Mary you are going to have a son and his name Shall be Called Jesus amen my point in telling you all of that is because in Genesis one Genesis uh when God created Adam it was not supposed to to be through sexual reproduction it is supposed to be via the spoken word amen yes amen Adam was supposed to tell if if you shall have a son and his name Shall be Called Adam uh sorry what's his name Abel and his name Shall be Called Abel and he was supposed to say be it unto me according to Thy word come on can I get some free people here amen amen that is how it's supposed to be through spiritual multiplication amen but we find Satan who wanted worship had now incarnated in a serpent and he was there to deceive the women amen and we find here that God couldn't use Adam and Eve because of the fall and he cast them out of the Garden of Eden so he was always looking for a man that he could walk through amen amen he's always looking for a man that he can work through amen amen so he he moves along and but the Earth became so wicked that he had to destroy it by a flood amen and then you know out of After the flood there comes now the three the three sons of Noah amen and they have children but then God chooses as one specific man yes and he wants to start the family of God again through this man amen but this man is an idol worshipper amen so he's got to learn the ways of God Amen so he doesn't have a written word to follow he has the audible voice of God to follow that tells him get thee out of thy country and he listens to the voice of God that's obedience to the word of God without knowing this God Amen God Appears to him and tells him if you follow me I will do certain certain things for you amen and in obedience through the voice of God Amen he follows the voice of God and he comes all the way to the promised land amen but it's in the promised land now even though he's in the land he's got no seed but he's still faithful to believe God and at 75 maybe there was a chance of him to reproduce himself because you can see it evident when he reproduced himself through ishma through AER and God ishmail but when all ops was gone and his body was dried up amen he's now 99 years old and Sarah is old she had gone past she couldn't bring forth children amen amen there was something wrong with Sarah's body that she could not bring forth seed yes even when Abraham could produce yes but now even Abraham had gotten so old that he couldn't bring forth children now in a time of impossibility no matter how impossible your situation is God can still move on the scene he's a god of the impossible amen if God wants to make you young again he can make you young I don't think you heard me even now you may be 65 you may be 75 but God chooses to turn you young again that's his choosing in fact one of these days between 6 and 9 he is going to make you young again believe out this amen amen oh yes Lord the Bible says that our body shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen hallelujah denominational people don't understand these things that's why when you find them when you read the books and you read the the children's story books and they have pictures of Heaven they got old people there they got young people there they got children there you ever seen these pictures amen but that's not the way God wants us to be amen heav will be in the prime of our life amen imagine now brother s we go to heaven and we still in our old bodies and now imagine we must enjoy eternity with all bodies uh that's not my God no amen amen God is going to turn you back to your brence of your youth amen amen amen amen amen maybe you got one leg here amen hallelujah but in the moment in the twinkling of an eye your missing limb shall appear amen you shall have two legs amen yes amen amen one of these mornings it won't be long amen some of you wearing glasses you're going to say I can't see amen because you know when you got perfect eyesight and you put on glasses it's still blurry are you hearing what I'm saying you're going to think there's something wrong with your prescription you're going to think hey I can't see I need to change my prescription and then you're going to walk past the mirror you going to wonder Hallelujah mirror mirror on the wall yeah who is this fairest person that I see amen thank you amen hallelujah amen maybe Through The Years you put on a little weight but that's not your ought to be conditioned one of these days you're going to see your shirt become big come on now no amens for that praise the Lord Brilliance of your youth think of how you were 21 Brother s what 28 waste was it 28 28 waste amen praise the Lord amen amen amen you are 28 Wast as well you can't wait you'd rather buy some 28 pants there prepare for the promise amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen but that's a reality amen it might sound far fet to you but that's a reality yes thank you Lord amen hallelujah so we see amen we're talking about what is worship so God was looking for a man that he could work through so this man is learning about God he's trusting God and and there came moments of weaknesses amen that came to present themselves where amen he lied to the king but you we went through that process and showed you how God was removing all unbelief amen even after they have a body change God puts them there in Genesis chapter 20 one more time to go through King abik yes because God wants Abraham to identify this is not my sister this is my wife amen yes God wants to get rid of the old lie amen amen oh yes stop seeing as your sister this is my wife through Whom The Promised seed shall come amen hallelujah and there you see the chapter closes out you know it closes out with the Divine Healing he has to pray for ab amen you has to pray for him and the Bible says when Abraham prayed sickness left their body and the whs of the woman were open then we came to Genesis 21 and you saw Sarah began to laugh again and they said the Lord had made me laugh again and all that sees me shall laugh because of the joy for Isaac is born into this house amen and they began to praise the Lord but now 12 years passed 12 years goes by amen and they find that the boys are growing up together ishma and Isaac are growing up as brothers but you know ishma is a bit older and he starts to Mock and make fun and then the seed can't be air with the Shar yes yes yes the Shar has got to pull away yes amen and even though this boy may have been an apple to Abraham's eye because in his mind he regarded him as his first born and Sarah is telling him cast out the born women yes cast out the bond Women Within you there's a spirit man and there's a flesh man God is telling you get rid of the flesh Man cast out the Bor women amen amen hallelujah you need to be born again amen we got too many people that's trying to operate with the faith of Isaac but they operating with the faith of ishma because they refuse to cast out the Bor women they refuse to let go of the old man amen so what is worship we find here Genesis 22 is a time after the separation from all unbelief after the separation where he gets rid of Ishmael and you find there that he's grieved in his heart and Sarah tells him I want this boy gone and Abraham is grieved but the Lord tells Abraham listen to Sarah and you find what you you know Abraham is a kind arted man he would have Laden donkeys he would have Laden cattle and he would have Laden things on that donkey and sent his son out but you watch Sarah refused she says this guy will not be air to my son and the Bible says he sent him away with water and bread he sent him away with water and bread but God will not forsake the seed yes some of us are more wicked than God but God comes and he meets them and he tells them I'm going to make you a great nation amen I'm going to make you a great nation and God blessed that Nation the Bible says he became a great Archer amen hallelujah and you find there's so many denominational churches out there the wild seed running with the gospel but God still blesses them amen amen God still blesses them praise the Lord but then there's the promised seat now he's 12 years old so what is worship Genesis 22 the first time worship comes in the Bible but watch how he speaks we find you after two days on the third day amen amen the Bible says he lifted up his head amen you find here in verse 4 224 on the the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and he saw the place a far off for two days his head was down because he knew he must Slaughter his son but on the third day the word of the Lord lift up your head lift up your head amen lift up your head for the place of sacrifices before you now some of us may not like amen the sermon this morning but it's fine amen hallelujah am amen because it's going to mean a lot of self- sacrifice it's going to mean a lot of dying to ourselves we got too much spiritual laziness amen amen too much spiritual laziness amen hallelujah you want to know what I'm talking about ask yourself what you were doing last night in preparation for the service right amen amen praise the Lord and now you find it on the third day amen hallelujah on the third day day is when the supernatural All Things become possible and what does he do he leaves the two behind the two young men there's a separation Time even they can come a certain stage in the journey but there's a further place that you must go into the holiest of holies that they can't come in it's a place of sacrifice it's the place of worship amen and only a select few can go go in because they that worship must worship Him in spirit and Truth amen and what is truth Jesus said my word is truth so they were going with the word of the Lord they were going with truth and they were going to worship in spirit because there's no man that could have operated like this in the flesh Abraham was not moving according to his flesh yes he was walking by faith and not by sight amen I don't think it's possible for you to go and sacrifice your son if you're moving in the flesh so Abraham was moving in spirit and in truth amen and he was going to Worship the Lord amen so worship is when God gives you an instruction and you follow those instructions are you hearing me amen maybe you're thinking worship is just confined to singing to coming here in this place and raising your hand Worship You Lord Worship You Lord but then you don't obey his word I told you when we started out that lots of people have gone into the house of worship but they don't obey the Bible you say they don't obey the Bible no how also they don't want to be baptized according to acts 238 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen no we love the we We Love to Worship but you're not obeying the word worship is obeying the word amen amen hey now they got now they got amen Bishop after and Pastor Mara every wife of every Pastor becomes a pastor but they're not obeying the master because the master says I suffer a woman not to teach or Ser authority over a man no but we love God but you don't love his word that's correct we just love this Divine beings we love to imagine three Gods we are Idol worshippers we love three Gods but the Bible says here oh Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord amen there's no EX in this hour after Revelation 10:7 is is fulfilled because Revelation 10 the prophet was supposed to reveal the mystery of God and he told you how God was condescending from Spirit to word to flesh it's one God changing form amen amen for you younger people if you're doing a play one person can take three different parts in the play they can go change their costume and come back so God was a spirit wanted to condescend because man had fallen so he came from Spirit to word to flesh amen that's why John 1 says that in the beginning amen the Word was God and the Word was with God the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us amen you see these things that are common to us because the eyes of our understanding have become open this is a veil to most people they can't see it thank you Lord thank you Lord but it's the word of God yes thank you Lord amen amen hallelujah you find why most marriages fail they don't have Christ as the head of the house they don't have the husband as the head of the home they don't have the wife amen and then the children they don't have the biblical pattern for marriage amen so the man is subject to Christ amen the man is not ruling without Christ if a man wants to rule his home he's got to have Christ as his Ed hello if a man wants to have rulership over his home he's got to have Christ as the head and you saying where do I find Christ yes Christ so if this is not your head and you're not taking instruction from the word of God how are you leading your home amen how are you leading your home some of you don't like this practical teaching amen but even in marriage you could stand there before the the pastor and you want to get married and the pastor tells you it's a three cord Union it's you your spouse and Christ but you are thinking now Christ is descend from the heavens into your home and this is never read between you and the wife this is never read in your home amen amen hallelujah this is the cord third chord the word of God am how many of you know this is no different to God his word amen amen this is the written form of his word amen to obey this is true worship you say are you saying that I thought I can just come and raise my hands hey I want a form of godliness I want everyone to see I'm going that's why when you're walking in the morning you're putting your Bible here and walking you want everyone to see it you screaming at the CH that's my Bible and bring it you you're going to church where's my Bible I don't know Mommy where you left you last week when you came from church I can't find it anywhere hey maybe I left it in the church you only found that now Sunday morning hey but worship is when God gives you an instruction and you follow it amen that's true worship to obey the voice of God Amen Amen to follow those instructions and in worship there's got to be death cuz you find there was going to be death in the scene in worship there's got to be dead to self amen the flesh man does not want to follow the instruction of God but the spirit man loves the instruction of God and says not my will but thy will be done amen I'm willing to crucify myself that's why the Apostle Paul says I Die daily amen amen yes amen that proves you love him that proves you worship Him in spirit and in truth amen that is worship obedience to the word of God without questioning obedience to the word of God without wavering yes amen the Bible says forsake not the assemblying together of yourselves even as you see the day fast approaching or he says even as the manner of some is but I put reason to it then you're now like Eve reasoning with the word amen now you're like you like Eve when you when you say you know Paul was writing to those church people there you know they were a bit oldfashioned then he me you know I love my jeans I love my jeans I'm not talking to the men now amen on a Sunday and length on a Monday yo above the knee Tuesday above the knee wedes day pants slacks ducking and Diving changing clothes amen people don't want freedom in Christ they want to go after the things of the world Amen Hallelujah but we've got to come to a place where we lay down our own Ambitions and our desires and say not the flesh man rule this heart you know God wants rulership of our hearts yes amen but let Christ take this place the Throne of our heart Amen Let Christ reign supreme amen so give no no place for the flesh to dominate me and have control over me I know what I'm talking about it's an our age it's the easiest age to satisfy the flesh Amen in an age of entertainment in an age where communication is easy in an age where amen it's so easy to to occupy your mind with other things the word of God has taken second place in most people's lives if it's there second place amen but the word of God comes to Abraham and by the spirit of God he's willing to go and do what God asked him to do without telling Sarah what he was going to do amen yes you know I was reading brother Joshua was telling me about this book of jesa was it jesha right the Bible references the book of jesa you find many times and there you you'll read a more dramatic account of Sarah if you going to find the chapter actually there it's chapter 23 that they sacrifice it's chapter 23 right that they sacrifice Isaac here it's chapter 22 but in the book of josua it falls in chapter 23 there but you'll find there how Sarah goes I'm just quoting the book of jasher now to you Sarah goes looking because she finally realized what Abraham's about to do and she goes pursuing them trying to find him amen because what Abraham was doing was not a normal thing you got to be a man of Faith amen you got to have heard from God himself and you got to be able to recognize the voice of God to do what he was going going to do to kill his son amen SAR would have told him have you have you g mad you're going to kill your son you waited 100 years 100 years Abraham now you're going to kill him you sure it wasn't the devil speaking to you amen we find amen there's certain places that only you and your sacrifice can go am worship is between you and God that is why you can't depend on the opinion if your father your mother your brother your sister this is between you and God Amen you can't take their opinion through Worship You must enter in alone with God you coming in obedience to his word matters not if they they cast you out of the home but you know you have a personal relationship with the Lord you go into the inner Court nobody can come you can't take the donkey there you can't take these two men there you've got to enter in alone amen he couldn't take unbelief there these two boys would have stopped him yeah yes when you come into the third pool there's no place for the other two amen some of you very uh studious here you can type the two with whoever I'm not going to say it today but you can type those two with who there came a point in Abra 's life where he moved into a place of worship and he left the other two behind and if you know true worship is not something flashy oh yes amen so he went to a simple humble Ministry amen oh yes Lord yes the ministry had changed and it went into a simple humble Ministry maybe it was looking like a wooden room hey you know wood types humility that is why pulpits are made of wood do you know that that's why it's also wood types judgment you going to your cour houses is wood there judgment from the house of God that's why I don't like to go to these churches and preach where they got perspects and glass and all these things the pulpit must be made of wood amen hallelujah amen amen so worship is not by your five senses you can't worship god with your five senses worship must be in spirit amen and in truth yes amen hallelujah you see here worship does something it changes you the way you talk what did he say there watch how prophetic he is worship will make you do things and when you're a Son of God you will start to speak things that will confound the wise here you heard brother jaffer's testimony you heard all the testimonies in the church going forth these people you heard brother Caleb's testimony they are doing things that is not based on the five senses right amen it's based on faith amen amen read verse five there put up verse five he's going to sacrifice but listen to his confession you don't speak what you're going to do or what the situation is verse 5 Abraham said unto his young men abide here with the ass I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you amen yes he's speaking that with such Faith we're going to come back back amen whether Isaac is dead and I kill him the Lord is able to raise him up am amen and we are coming back yes you speak that over your situation I don't care how lost your loved one is I don't care how far gone in the world Amen you tell Satan I'm going to get him and we are coming back amen don't give up on your daughter don't give up on your son don't give up on your brother or your sister claim them for the Lord Jesus Christ amen stand in the need stand in the time of intercession amen hallelujah I don't care how far gone you with your sickness amen I don't care if the fourth Rider you know they call it the stage four there's no more stages after four because it's the fourth house Rider yes they say stage four is the worst I don't care if it's stage four amen raise up your faith hallelujah what else have you got to lose yes if you don't raise up up in faith you're going to lose your life stage four or not amen I declare about the power of almighty God that every cell within me shall be healthy and every cell that's gone cancerous shall leave my body my blood cell shall rejuvenate and shall create new blood cells Within Me amen I don't care if the insulin levels are too high in my body I command my body Amen to the cerol to come back I command my body for my sugar levels to normalize I command my blood pressure to come back order I command fatty liver to lose their fat and come back to the normal condition speak what you want thank you Lord thank you Lord stop saying I'm sick stop saying I have this and I have that as long as that's your confession then that's what you'll

a youer there'll be nobody who can turn me out amen amen praise the Lord so he starts to speak like God that's what I'm trying to show you here this man is now in the image and likeness of God he starts to speak like God that when God looked over a dark World Genesis 1 there he looked over a chaotic world he looked over a void World God didn't speak what he saw Yes God spoke what he wanted to see let there be light and the Bible says there was light never speak negative over your life yes never speak the situation am if you need to tell anyone this is what the doctor said but this is what the Bible says amen there's a difference between facts and there's a difference between truth You' seen the situation yeah was Sister Maggie in the service couple weeks ago the doctor was presenting facts based on knowledge how many years he may have studied who knows he's this doctor quite old how old is he 60 something so 60 years is a lot of experience and he tells her you got kidney failure she comes into the line unfortunately we don't record all of these things we switch the camera off amen hallelujah amen and here you all know what's spoken over prayed and here she comes back that was what 3 days later the doctor says I'm confused all indications all signs were showing kidney failure but all your results are clear who is that oh yes amen who is that in an instant yeah the same service brother Joshua sitting here gland swollen gland in in his ear the moment the quote is read about the angel of the Lord moving through the neighborhood and healing This Woman's here for the Joshua claims the promise amen he receives it pain leaves him by the service time service ends gland is going down but the next day it was completely dried up amen yes sister Sarah's testimony you heard her testimony as she was not feeling well and she said before the prayer landine was called she was already healed amen it was afterwards that I like the way she phrased she says the same Angel of the Lord who was passing by Brother Joshua must have passed by her I can feel the brush of angel's wings I see glory on his face surely the presence of the Lord is in this place you see you need to look through the eyes of Faith because right now there's angels all around us and if we can only open up our eyes Jesus thank you Lord thank you Jesus heaven's just a prayer away amen amen you know something about something about Abraham here he never prayed to the Lord and said Lord are you sure I'm about to plunge the knife are you going to change the way he continues to speak like a god man I and the lad will return am amen amen I and the lad will return then what else what else he says there amen he speaks another thing here Isaac questions him and Abraham says in verse 8 God will provide a lamb for a burnt offering what is he speaking he's speaking the creative word he's speaking God never told him I'm going to come in on the scene Abraham you go there and set to set this thing up I'm going to come in on the scene just you and I secret between you and me he's moving by faith and God is saying look at my son amen this one is like Adam again he's speaking those things he's calling those things which are not as though they are he's starting to learn my ways he's starting to speak like God oh yes amen hallelujah these people are praying for K engines they're praying for cell phones they're praying for telephones oh yes hey they're praying over fridges they're praying over amen how many things navels brother Joshua was telling me many years ago he prayed for brother Noah he had what was wrong with him something in his amen and I don't know what what happened it went away here we got sister Ruth how many people believe she got a new art yes amen amen that's what the scripture says I'm not making this up the Bible says a new art I will give you that's right amen amen amen Bible says a new art I will give you yes a new spirit and I will put my spirit within you oh yes thank you amen who was it the real Sister Christina of the sister that says it's too big it's not going down we need to operate she puts a fa into action amen she says but that evening that thing was gone down and when she went back for the test and said we can't find a trace of it who was it amen sister s cancer case amen the doctor says you can seize all medication we don't find any trace of cancer amen who is that amen hallelujah L you s l testimony listening to a clip she says she feels like the fire of God come upon her she couldn't walk or something she says angel of God we know it's the angel of God yes touch her and she says she was walking around the house the same day amen hallelujah who is it that was with Brother s in the hospital for how many 70 something days when no visitors was allowed amen he says I will never leave you nor forsake you I will be with you but you got to know how to worship Him amen that's true worship is obeying his word amen so Abraham goes all the way to the point of true worship amen true worship you can't listen to your wife you can't listen to anybody else it's between you and God Amen and we find here that the Apostle Paul is picking it up and he says that Abraham believed that he was able to raise ra him up from the dead your situation that you're going through maybe you feel it's hopeless you feel maybe you're too old you're too young whatever it is the time is gone let me just bury this dream I'm here with resurrection power this morning Amen to speak over your situation and tell you it's not time to bury the dream in fact of having a funeral service over your situation how about you have a resurrection service over your situation amen how about calling Jehovah Gyra on the scene and say that my God shall provide himself amen hallelujah amen oh yes so worship is based on obeying God's word what's in the Bible and Abraham we know he lived by faith and not by sight amen when he was tried and tested offered up Isaac and he received the promises of God and so will you if you walking in faith you are backed by the promises of God Amen not one word will fail you heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not fail you God's word will never fail you you can rest your promises you can rest your entire life on the word of God Amen Hallelujah you see we need to move our faith into another level what is believing believing is not just saying I'm believing believing is taking the relevant action required doesn't isn't there message hearing recognizing acting on the word of God acting that's true believing anyone can say I believe the word of God but they never act on it you know anyone can say I believe in baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but they never act on it and they never physically get baptized is that believing no so believing results in a corresponding action yes true believing results in a corresponding action you can't say I believe this and then you remain in your old house you got to come out of her my people amen be not partakers of her sins amen hallelujah amen so Abraham knew the promise of God that said I'm going to I have made the a father of many nations so he knew that no way was Isa going to be dead so it's with you in your situation there's no way that your situation will not be met your need will not be met because God has already given you his promise in his word don't ask questions how amen when you go and and start to reason you're moving into unbelief amen don't question how be ready to worship amen be ready to obey the word of God Amen you told me to worship and you told me to worship by killing my son that's how I'm going to worship you in a way that's called ay that's the way we worship the god of our fathers amen amen glory be to his name amen you know there's something between Faith there there's a difference between faith and trust how many if you know that there was this man very quickly we'll close on this there was a man his name was called blondon and he had a tight rope moving from America to Canada and it was a great feat in the 1800s he would walk this tight rope and he would walk it blindfolded and he would do back flips on it and he would push a wheelbarrow over it and he even cooked an omelet one day while walking through this how many if you want to try the tit Trope amen now he had faith that he could accomplish his Feats he had real faith that he could do it amen and he trusted in his abilities to complete them but The Spectators only had Faith they didn't have trust you see you can have faith but you need trust as well trust is another level that's what Abraham had he trusted the God that he had faith in can you trust the god that you have faith in because some people say I have faith in God but they still move on their own steam because they don't trust him they still got the hand in the situation because they don't trust him so there was another man called Eric kod one day you see all of these Spectators that came to watch him and applaud him they never trusted him but one man who had faith in blondon cul one day The Spectators saw that this man was hanging on the back you know what I'm talking about they call it balata he was doing piggyback piggy [Music] back how many of you would go and jump on a man's back who's walking a tit TR so you don't have trust so you see this man moved from faith in this man to trust in him and he jumped on his back and this man is walking the tit R and how was it successful they interviewed him after that he says well blondon the man who was walking in the tight TR told me you are no longer call Cord you are now blondon you become one with me oh yes amen he told him until I clear the spot amen if I sway you sway with me you don't try to balance on your own whatever movements I make you just let your body lay limp on me me trust me amen and I'll get you over this oh yes that's the difference between faith and trust the spectators had faith in the man and believed in his ability but only car cord trusted him enough to climb on his back and allow him to carry him through that's what we need to trust God like amen praise the Lord amen you know there's many styles when we're coming back to praise and worship now in the church people think oh God is not moved that's why God is telling now the woman at the well you say that you Worship in this mountain he's saying you know not who you worship God is not interested in the worship of Man based on Traditions God is not looking for an Indian style of worship he's not looking for a black style of worship amen because you know people confus that oh I like how the blacks worship no we just told you what true worship is oh I like it how the whites worship I like it how the col's worship no God is looking for Spirit style worship amen a worship that's not coming from a cultural type of worship God is looking for Spirit Worship truth worship amen the one that goes beyond the flesh am you know a lot of people who are moving like this doesn't mean that they are worshiping amen maybe they're moving to a beat and now you watch a lot of worldly Styles and dances have got into the churches they bringing those styles from the world into the church right amen and they want to bring those moves into the church it goes beyond the Flesh and the way we feel about it amen what we think is the right Style and type of worship worship is to God Amen hello worship is never based on our Judgment of what it is or what it should look like hello yes yes so why do we stand in it and say ah uh worship is to God and it's directed to God and has nothing to do what we like or don't like you find many times we have a lot to say about worship we can criticize people in the way they worship and you find many times amen the worship is not directed to you so why you got a problem with it right it's directed to God Amen so we should not have an opinion about it amen and that's how the devil is robbing you of worshiping just because somebody is dancing and shouting and screaming it does not mean that they are worshiping it could just be fleshly emotions that are carried away by the music but true worship comes from the innermost being of a person true worship is from the spirit of man man that is created in spirit being amen he created in the image and likeness of God so man must Worship in spirit he says God is spirit and they that worship must worship Him in spirit and in truth yes no problem I like to dance but make sure your spirit is worshiping inside of you amen when you're raising your hand amen praise the Lord make sure your spirit is is raising your hand amen hallelujah true worship amen worship is about sacrifice I ask you what are you willing to sacrifice Amen to worship God in spirit we must engage our own being our hearts mind Souls body and spirit amen true worship is not limited to external actions or rituals but involves a deep a deep worship from within it says therefore I urge you you Brothers in the view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to God that is your spiritual sacrifice and do not conform to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen so worship is something amen how many if you know that God should have first place in your heart if God does not have first place in your heart then God is not your God the thing that has first place in your heart is your god the prophet says the thing you spend most time with becomes your God if you watch television more than you read the word of God then television is your god yes if you spend more time on your car then your car is your God if you spend more time on your wife your wife is your god hello have you read these things if you spend more time on your house your house is your god whatever you spend time in it's your God you know the devil has pulled a fast one in so many people when we think of idolatry we will think as Buddha Krishna Idols Buddha and Krishna don't look like Buddha and Krishna anymore devil worship is Messi Ronaldo Salah Beyonce JayZ Rihanna yes Prince this princess that Queen this queen that Idols these are the modern day Idols because if I brought something like that Idols that they have in religion you know better you won't worship it but the Satan has pulled a fast one that's right hey young people not going to like this if you spend more time on PS4 that's your God because before you know how many hours are gone amen hello everyone's gone you know you can be physically here but you're already packed up and you gone that's how powerful the mind is some people already sitting outside and waiting for the snacks amen let's give the Lord a good enap of Praise amen worship that pleases God Worship Is Not What pleases us it's what pleases God and it'll take great sacrifice to get into a worship that pleases God and full obedience to the word is what true worship is all about and full obedience to the word entitles you to the ghost Holy Ghost and that's what we after Holy Ghost fills Sons and Daughters of God Amen let's Stand Together praise His name amen praise the Lord let's sing amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah it's worthy to be praised what a God we serve amen you know God left everything all the Splendor of heaven and he came down for you and I to save us do you know what that is he left everything he took on the form of man now we could have gone on and maybe you can go and study this that the Bible says that he learned obedience through suffering the Bible says he was tempted on All Points you say on All Points yes he had to be tested on All Points so that you can know what you are going through and because he overcame you overcame I don't know if you heard what I said because he overcame you're not you're going to overcome because he overcame it you have overcome because you overcame Temptation you have already overcome Temptation you see it's not based on our works it's based on what Christ has done for us so ask yourself do you think Christ was tempted with woman as a young man yes every point he was tested on you would have been tested on alcohol you would have been tested on the things of that was in in the world at that time the devil came there in the to tempt him with the riches of the world with money finances kingdoms of the world he was tempted on All Points yes yet he was found obedient to the will of the father in every one of them all he's asking for you to is to have faith in him believe his word and Obey him surrender die to self I if you are willing to have a burial service and say I'm willing to die to self amen kill the flesh man and let there be a resurrection of the spirit man amen glory be to his name amen praise the lordu thank you Jesus amen isn't he worthy of Praise he's worthy of glory amen Let's Just Surrender to him amen let's just lay aside everything and say Lord I want to let go of everything maybe unknowingly I was caught up in these things I was caught up in idolatry and Pagan worship amen I don't want to be caught up in those things anymore God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and you can only worship God if you obey his word God will not accept anything else if your heart is far removed from him he will not accept it so come today and say Lord I want to surrender my life to you if it means me sacrificing my friend friends my family if you mean me to sacrifice that and place that on the altar I
