here today thank you and on behalf of my church in cape town by the tabernacle my wife sister earnestly in the family we like to express our condolences to their families that lost their loved ones and knowing that god is the only wanted to cover we have an entry date and we have an expiry date we have a manufacturing date and we have also a date that the manufacturer is inspired and so whatever god does is always well done we pray that the lord will bless the families and also bless our sister and bless each and every one who have lost a loved one and in this time of pandemic when the lord will come during his time we are certainly happy that we will be here to be your mother adrian and he's their wife and i'm joshua and neptune yesterday and we live with them and we are certainly happy that we can be a blessing to you and we are enlightening special people but god has called us by his grace and as we sang the little song we are helping you this message by grace and may god bless you may god bless your children and may god bless your grandchildren and may god bless whatever you do your work and whatever god is in store for you may the hand of the lord be he will be with the party at this time uh we're here this morning also to do the uh voting the ordination of and uh watching our brother adrian as the local pastor as everything has been done by the former prosper which is there to sanction into us god's blessings and to see how people feel and we just want to say thank you for coming and those who could not come i will not believe that they will protect our brother joshua if you have your bibles with you today we read in the word of god uh in the book of ethics chapter chapter one and we read verses nine uh the book of equal estates chapter one and verses nine from the old testament the bible reached us the thing that has been it is that it shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun amen then also we read in the book of second corinthians chapter chapter 4 and we read from verse 16 and we trust the lord will bless the living of his word to our hearts ii chapter 4 and verse 16 to 18. the bible reads that spell for which cause we faint not but though our upward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things that are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are not seen are temporal but things are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal may god bless the reading of this word that says have a word of prayer uh kind father we are certainly grateful thankful for the opportunity the privilege to be at the tabernacle and we thank you for the songs that we've heard here today about sunset mountain god redemption by power seven angels that came we are certainly happy lord to living this wonderful day one at a time and to see this great message of the hour unfold to us we understand that no man they give us a revelation not even william bannon could give us revelation all revelation comes from god and father we want to say thank you we pray god at your comfort those who god was lost their loved ones we pray god that you will heal the wound and that's where the venom said lord our death is like tooth extraction it hurts for a while but after a while the god heals up again and so lord we pray that you bless this assembly we pray god for the future of this church we pray god for the leadership and we pray that you will bless them and may the hand of god be upon each and every one we pray for every assembly in durban and every local minister in your local church those who are struggling and those who are finding your feet we pray that you will help them father we are not divided but we are one body and we look not to the things that we see and we look to the things that are unseen and these unseen things are more real than what we can see may you bless your people bless the word of god to our hearts in jesus name amen and you may take your seats we want to greet you in the name of the lord and we are certainly happy to be in the house of the lord here today and we want to be looking at our thoughts here this morning on there's nothing new under the sun and for uh inspiration the unseen is more real than what we can see so two scriptures that we want to focus on is the there's nothing new under the sun and uh and so we see that the unseen things are more real that what we can see we see our natural things that we are coming to the earth with no choice he did not ask to be in south africa uh you didn't ask to be in a certain family to be united to be ready to be a chatty or uh to be a gang in everything that god has planned for us before the world ever began and so we have no choice of country we have no choice of family uh we have no choice of country but god placed us on the earth at a certain time in a certain family under a certain message and god is in control of all things and so god is so more supreme that what we can think that our normal mind can never comprehend the greatness of almighty god and so we see that everything around us our achievements and our natural birth has begins natural birth has a beginning we have a manufacture date we have an expiry date we have an entry date we have an exit date everything in this life is natural and there's no continuing setting nothing that continues on and what we see today is already has been and so we see that genesis is the book of seeds and revelation is a book of harvest so we're living in harvest time what was sown in seed form has now come back into harvest form and so we can see a pattern that god has that everything that we we see today has been played out in some form in some nation in some family or some individual but there's nothing new under the sun and we look at raya we see that ray was the type of the entire bride how that she was a bad infant woman but she was called to marry solomon the general of bethlehem and she became the great grandmother of king david we looked at ruth coming from a moabitess nation and incest this nation and yet she became the bride of boaz and so we can see a pattern you can see we're back here in the evening time uh we can see the lamborghini in the evening time we can see a harvest
