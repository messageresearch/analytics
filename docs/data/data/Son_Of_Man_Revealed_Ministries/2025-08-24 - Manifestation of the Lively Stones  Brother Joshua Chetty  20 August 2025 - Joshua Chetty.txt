========================================

your word, Lord, that you will come and speak to our souls. Now, we ask and commit the service into your name and under your mighty hand, oh God, in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated a moment. I greet you all in the precious the holy name, the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. A lot of people are not here tonight. Amen. Unwell with the flu. Flu virus is going around. Amen. And remember Romesh called me earlier and he went to the doctor today with the flu. Amen. Brother Luke also unwell. I myself was unwell. I didn't go to work today. Amen. So still recovering from this flu. So amen. Take care of yourselves. Hydrate yourselves. And uh you've got one health, one life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we need to be good stewards of this body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I see our brother Ravi here. Very good to see you. Let's give our brother Ravi a hand. Amen. It's been a while since we seen him, but Amen. I was talking to him a little while ago and he told me that he would come. Amen. So that's Matilda's father. Amen. So you know when he when he saw the revelation of baptism, uh I think it was a few years ago now, maybe 3 4 years, then he wanted to get baptized. Amen. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I don't know if sister Matilda told you, but we had another brother come in on Sunday that brother Salvin was witnessing to. Amen. So we had to baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So we went out to the Stanmore swimming pool and we Amen. managed to get the brother baptized. Amen. So even as we said we are living in the last and final days of the Gentiles, the Lord will soon be turning his attention to the Jews. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know that right now, Amen. He's totally focused on the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. God don't walk with the two people at the same time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So right now he's totally focused on the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. On us getting us ready. And if we only knew our importance in the body of Christ that Christ is depending on us to come to the full maturity of the word. Amen. Then we will understand our part in the body. Hallelujah. So sometimes what we need to do if we can't overcome the things of this life if we don't overcome ourselves &gt;&gt; sometimes we need to get over ourselves. Amen. And get over the things of ourselves our own carnal natures. And if you find ourselves slipping or maybe even you find yourself getting caught up in things of the world, slipping with the things of the world, ask yourself what are you feeding yourself with? &gt;&gt; There's definitely a lack of nutrition somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we're not feeding on the word and on the things of God and we're not supplementing that word by prayer, then we're going to find ourselves in the flesh in carnality. &gt;&gt; And that's where we don't want to find ourselves in this time and season because God is pouring out his spirit in his people through his people. Amen. So I ask you to remember these believers in prayer that are not here. Amen. That the Lord will strengthen them, touch them. Amen. Also pray for brother Dixon and his family. Uh they were Amen. and they were last year in church 3 weeks ago. And uh I'll just share this with you so that you can remember the family. They were thrown into a situation when they went back home. And so when they got back home, their son Jared, you know Jared that grew up in the church and then he backslid. So he was waiting at the door with a bush knife and a knife for his father. So he basically chased them away from the house. He's now staying there with his family, with his wife. Uh so you know it's not they they haven't been back home for the last 3 weeks now. So they've been staying with the son. Sister Dave was is in Johannesburg. She's coming back tomorrow. This is how the devil works. Amen. Sometimes you'll raise somebody in the house to cause a problem and now their life is dis disrupted. I mean these are pensioners and they need their home. So I want you to commit this family in prayer. Amen. That that demon power that's raised up in the brother Amen. will leave. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there'll be some resolution in the family. So they haven't come to church. Amen. Because of that. And they call me to tell me this. Amen. So I want you I'm not telling you this for gossip. Neither am I telling you for entertainment. I'm telling you because they are part of the body and I'm asking you to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. That the Lord will intervene. So we've seen tremendous testimony today. even uh you know pastor Moses Jova from Zimbabwe call me and the first question he asked me is how's the angel of the lord you know and I told him well he's fine he's doing just fine you know we're getting test getting testimonies daily and he says yes tell me about it I said brother you know I I can't share all the testimonies with you because this is not to promote a ministry I said this is how the lord is working in the lives of the individuals I said the ministry is here to equip the believers and they themselves are seeing the testimonies. So I said we have life testimonies. We have testimonies of healing people's personal problems, people's personal Amen. situations in their lives. Yes. Speaking the word and believing it and it is coming to pass. Amen. And you'll see many testimonies. Even sister J was sharing a testimony. Amen. If you saw in the group, she put a testimony or a prayer request for sister Pam. Amen. How many of you saw that? &gt;&gt; And if you prayed, Amen. So the Lord has touched her and whatever she was experiencing is totally gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. So even the sister who couldn't explain it and we know it's a supernatural touch of the Lord and I was telling sister J in the car on the way here. Sometimes it's a simple act of faith cuz none of us would have known about a sister's testimony or prayer request if she didn't believe by faith and put the prayer request on the group. So it was a simple act of faith. The believers pray and the Lord answered prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we thank the Lord for that that we can see his mighty hand, his healing power even in these situations that we go through in life. So I encourage you to put God first and still believe him that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. This evening, we'll be ministered to by our brother Joshua. Amen. So let's stand together even as he comes. Share the word of the Lord. Amen. You believe in your heart that the Lord will speak to you tonight and the Lord will meet you at the point of your need. Amen. Sing, I've come expecting Jesus. I've come expecting Jesus. [Music] I've come expecting God. Sweetest Holy Spirit. Sweetest Holy Spirit. [Music] I'm desperate for your touch. I'm desperate for your touch. All let's declare now. I know you're more than able. I know you're more than able to meet me in this place. To meet me in this place. Thank you, Lord.

And we appreciate you, God, and for all that you are doing in our lives. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we thank you for your bountiful blessings that you have blessed us with, Lord.

Come and speak to our hearts now through your word. Father, in Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be found in the house of God. Amen. God bless you, brother Ravi. Good to see you. God bless every one of you. &gt;&gt; We got our Bibles. You turn to the book of one Peter. You know the enemy has come to steal and destroy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said he has come to give life and give it more abundantly. &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil comes to put inflictions upon our bodies. &gt;&gt; Because he know he got nothing to do with the soul. He can't touch our souls. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So he come to try and afflict us in every way possible. But we thank God that we have rightful claims &gt;&gt; to every redemptive blessing and to every promise in the word of God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that we want our bodies to serve God. &gt;&gt; We are placed on the third for a purpose and our purpose is to serve the father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to be about his business. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as long as he's got a work for us. Amen. Then he has to keep us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 2:4 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 4 and 5. to whom coming is unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious. Yay also as lively stones. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lively stones. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not dead stones. Amen. People that have life in them, not just any life, but the life of God in them are built up a spiritual house &gt;&gt; and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, behold I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect precious, and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe is precious. But unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the bullers disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, even to them would stumble at the word, being disobedient, where onto also they were appointed. But ye are a chosen generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A royal priesthood &gt;&gt; and holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just uh one more scripture before we be seated. Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists, some pastors and teachers &gt;&gt; for a purpose for the perfecting of the saints. &gt;&gt; For the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; So there's a purpose. Amen. Till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. How are you going to come to the a perfect man and to the knowledge of the son of God? Through the five-fold ministry. Amen. that we endort be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in way to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make it increase of the body into the unto the edifying of itself in love. Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know that Christ himself was the living stone rejected of men but chosen of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. But we as the bride are lively stones cut from the same rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Quickened by the same life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So we know this is not a theory we're talking about now. &gt;&gt; We just read something in in written form. But this is an hour and this is a season where what the word we read about now there must be a manifestation of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a season an hour of the manifestation of the lively stones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; These are not stones that that coming that stuck in later sea in amongst the denomination cold and formal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; These are not stillborn stones. M &gt;&gt; these stones have life in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is the life of the head. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this life is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This life is supernatural life. &gt;&gt; This life is divine life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we are made partakers of his divine nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And his divine characteristics &gt;&gt; must be manifested in us. &gt;&gt; Yes. If we have received him who have who the one that was the cornerstone which was rejected and now become the headstone. If we have received him the head then his divine characteristics his very attributes must be manifested in and through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we just want to speak on a little title the manifestation of the lively stones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Christ himself is the living stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Because if it wasn't if he's not the living stone, then how do we get that life? How do we be that life stones? &gt;&gt; Because we are cut out of him. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if he was rejected of men because of who he was, he was the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word was rejected. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So this true word in its true form must be rejected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By men of the world. Yes. &gt;&gt; But not sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Those that are part of God don't go away in the fors of God. All will come to the knowledge of the truth. &gt;&gt; All will come and be attracted to the true and living words. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We don't want a word of history. We don't want a a word of another day. We don't want a a word that died out. It's day or it's time because mana came for a certain time and died out. But we are called to come up higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Into the shikina glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And come into the most holy place &gt;&gt; where the word for heaven liveth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the mana is always fresh. &gt;&gt; So we know every stone had to be hooed and measured and set in place without the sound of a hammer. That was when he was building the temple. Amen. So just like that we had to be formed and and come into the place he had to bring us in. It wasn't the work of man bringing us in. Amen. It was the divine work of God bringing us in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And no matter what form he was coming, whatever form it was, he had to he had to hoon us out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a work. In other words, it's not a man's work. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Each one of us that are sitting here tonight can testify that we are here because we have been supernaturally called into this marvelous light to believe the word of God in this hour. No man has called us. He didn't take our own intellect and to make us realize that God sent a word to prepare us for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Because this message has come to give us rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; This message has come to connect us &gt;&gt; with Christ himself. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come to connect us with the stone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So we know there was life stone from the past ages which which formed the body of the pyramid. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know there've been seven church ages and in every age they were lively stones. Yes. God took called them out in the age set them apart and then they were packed away and then another age set in one age after the other. Amen. M &gt;&gt; it was like the baton was just being passed on. &gt;&gt; Amen. But in this age, Amen. This in the final age, Amen. This this is the age where it had to come now where the the stone was fitly framed together in such a way that now the headstone could come down because this is the age where he comes into union. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In no other age he could come in for into a marriage. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But in this age, he comes into a marriage union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The invisible union. Amen. Of the heavenly bridegroom with the earthly bride. &gt;&gt; No other age but in this age. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It wasn't why it's an invisible union. It wasn't seen to the eyes of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't seen to the church world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But it was an invisible union. For God's elected, &gt;&gt; for God selected few. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those that were part of him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Those were cut off from the same rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's come in this age that there are to be a connection. Amen. Not in any other age. In this age, there are to be this union. &gt;&gt; Amen. When when at the when the bride had to be honed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I think could we get to the quote that pastor Adrian read out? That's a lovely quote that the way the prophet brings it out there in the stature of a perfect man. Amen. He says, "And this church, you see, is coming smaller in the minority." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. You look at the pyramid from the the way it was, but now it's coming smaller. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is not going to be a mass group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God don't work in masses. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God worked with &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; special class of people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. With an elite class of people. &gt;&gt; Did he said to Elijah, "I have reserved for me 7,000." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. God always worked with the minority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't Gideon a mighty man of valor when the angel appeared to him. Amen. And he was selected army and then he bring them to so many thousand and then he bring it down till even he come to 300. And God will now work with a minority. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God has always been doing that. Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't look at the masses. God comes for his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this church you see is coming smaller in the minority. &gt;&gt; It's a whole lot sharper than that. &gt;&gt; But just like to write, you see what he's saying? It's coming even smaller. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To the final part of it. And this is the climax of it now where it's come even smaller now. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because even in in people that even you thought was in the message, they're drifting away or they dominating around manmade teachings. &gt;&gt; Not staying with the true word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not staying with the guy that's here. &gt;&gt; It's the angel of God that is leading the church. &gt;&gt; The mighty angel that is here amongst us. You've got to follow the angel. In every Exodus, it's the angel of God that is leading. Amen. And this in this Exodus, it's still the angel of God that is leading the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you've got to follow the angel of God, Amen. you've got to be sensitive to the move of the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you're sensitive to the move of the spirit, then he's going to take you into unknown territory. He's going to take you to higher dimensions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? You are getting you are drawing from heavenly places. &gt;&gt; You can if you want to draw from intellect, you can do that. If you want to draw from theology, you can make theology around his message. In fact, in this message, you can write a complete thesis, a doctorate on it. &gt;&gt; There's so much of word in it. But the Holy Spirit only works in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural message. Don't take a message that comes from another dimension, a message that comes, a mighty angel comes down with his message. Amen. from another dimension, from another world, and brings this message to this earthly dimension. Don't try to take this message and mix it with earthly teachings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We was already delivered from that. &gt;&gt; We was already called out of the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't take the traditions of men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The traditions of men take you and teach you in a certain way. &gt;&gt; They take the Bible and they teach the Bible in a certain way. &gt;&gt; We were delivered from the traditions of men. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were called up to come up higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are now in soaring in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only where heavenly creatures can saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. Earthly creatures cannot come there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to be an heavenly creature, it means you're always there to be that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is your makeup. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So this church you see is coming smaller in the minority. It's a whole lot sharper than that. But just like to write that cross there, see it's come up to a needle point. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Until the church in the minority has got to get into a place and until it's the same kind. &gt;&gt; Yes. of a ministry that this left because when this headstone comes back and we know he's already back. &gt;&gt; This is when this is now he's speaking about something to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's here. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got a little pocket like here where it's going to sit right in there on the regular pyramids. &gt;&gt; It's just a cap that sits across the top. It's like a flange. And pastor Adrian gave you the the meaning of that. It comes from the word rib as well. &gt;&gt; And it's got to sit on there cuz it sheds the water. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when it come the church has got to be honed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All rest the stones in the pyramid are laying so perfect till you can run a razor blade between them weighing tons laying in there. How they got them up they don't know. But they were built &gt;&gt; and up here when the pyramid cap does come itself the body of Christ will have to be horned. How we got here the world don't know. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How we got to believe this message the world don't know. &gt;&gt; How this message went across the world into islands into Amazon montaneous areas. &gt;&gt; Amen. Different tribes to the jungles &gt;&gt; into every nation and tribe. &gt;&gt; How this message went there? the world don't know. &gt;&gt; But it's the work of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the angel of God that's fixing things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Getting his people ready to leave this dimension, to leave this earth. Amen. This message comes so we can have enough ingredients to give us a body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To change this vile bodies. Amen. Into supernatural bodies. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he up here when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be horned not only just some creed or doctrine or something other we come through it will have to be so perfectly &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; like Christ &gt;&gt; till when he comes he and that ministry will fit right smack together &gt;&gt; then we'll come then will come the rapture the going. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see what season we are in now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You've got to recognize that this is the time of the manifestation now. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's got to manifestation of Christ must be formed in us. We must come into so it must be a splitting image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The very works of Christ must be manifested us. The life of Christ must be seen through us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Christ was all the word. So we must be all the word. So you see when the church comes to maturity now in every other age it was coming up. Amen. But this is the time now we've received we've said we've received the word we love the word so much but you cannot be going over ABCs and ABCs and ABC's. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about in as a body now. I'm not talking about as an individual. Individuals will grow in different stages in your home. You got different type of children. But as the body of Christ, Amen. It come to a maturity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The ministry of Christ will be so perfectly until the headstone must come to the church to put it together. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it only could come in this age where you come with a mature word, &gt;&gt; a seasoned word. Amen. And then if it if we come and we call up now into marriage, what the marriage does? Amen. It must it can't produce still born. It must produce fruits. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The union between the Christ and the church must produce fruits. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not going to produce stillborns. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That you'll find in Leosia. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not in Leosia. &gt;&gt; We've come up. We are the lively stones. &gt;&gt; Yes. You must produce sons and daughters of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like in Revelation 4:1, it says John is saying and the Bible says, "And I after I after this, I looked and behold a door was open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said, "Come up hither, &gt;&gt; and I will show thee things which must be here after." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So only when you're coming up under the headstone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you've got the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Then you know about things to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You've got to come. And this couldn't this coming of the headstone is Revelation 10:1. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because Christ himself shall descend from heaven with a shout. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With a voice of the archangel, with the trump of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's doing all three things as is descending. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The shout is so powerful when you thought you was insignificant in this world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The shout is so powerful when you thought that you are nothing in this world. You are just an ordinary citizen of this country. The shout came to show you who you truly are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It come to show you that you come from God. You go back to God. &gt;&gt; It come to show you that you're part of him &gt;&gt; because it comes with a quickening power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the shout comes, it wasn't received by then by the church world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Miracles were received by them. Signs and wonders was received by them. A wicked and adulterous generation secret after signs. &gt;&gt; But signs and wonders followed them. that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It follows the believer. We don't seek after it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Testimonies will follow you. You don't seek after that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we come to oneness with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to be in such a union with him. &gt;&gt; That we want to just every when people look at us, we just want them to see Christ in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in you, the hope of glory. Amen. So we find that lively stones are not bound to the dust of Leysia. &gt;&gt; They're not bound to the things of this world. They're not bound to creeds and dogmas because they are eagles. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; they are soaring in heavenly places. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:6 says, "And raised us up together &gt;&gt; and made us sit together." &gt;&gt; Together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we not separated body? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those that are part of this must be together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We must be of one mind of one accord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's not a man-made thing. Amen. My my work here, your work there. No, we are working for the body of Christ in one body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he made us sit to gather in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself. It is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Not of works lest any man should boast. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before orained that we should walk in them. So we know what leia produced cold lifeless stones. That's what he's producing out there. You see big churches, mega churches and so forth, but lifeless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think they're rich n but they're naked and nobody not. They're poor, miserable, blind. They're in such a bad condition that they don't know it. It's better that they know they're a sinner &gt;&gt; than not know it. On the day of judgment, the prostitute knows where she is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The drunkard know who he is. &gt;&gt; But the man that's thinking now I've done I I was serving God. I was going to church and I had religion. That's the problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But thank God we are passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are being judged to the word right now. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, &gt;&gt; we are being corrected to the word right now because we are the the word comes with a transforming power &gt;&gt; that we'll be we'll no longer conform to the pattern of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the word comes so we can be transformed by the renewing of our mind. &gt;&gt; Why? Our mind is renewed. The mind of Christ has come down. &gt;&gt; That we say no, we no longer we we are now under your headship, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; We come under submission to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you speak, we will follow. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you find that this bride although they are lifeless, they are cold, but this bride must be a living manifesting Christ right now. &gt;&gt; A living manifestation of Christ now. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is it? What is this manifestation of the life we're talking about? It's a reproduction of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is what? The continuation of the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; That's what it simply is. &gt;&gt; It is Christ being manifested in a many membered body. It's reproducing him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's completely reproducing him. Therefore, now you are being fruitful and you are multiplying. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are reproducing Christ again in a many membered body and you are continuing by the word being made flesh again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is not the word made flesh in one person now. It's one man. No, it's a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in this union, Amen. we've received the revelation of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. And the revelation takes us into the king's chamber. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It bring it is revelation that brings us by the door into the king's chamber. Amen. &gt;&gt; It brings us into intimacy. And when he brings us there because we already know what the king wants. We already know his everything about him. Amen. We've already learn heard everything about him and what he wants, what he desires. Amen. So we've come into full submission to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just like in the story of Esther. Amen. How she was brought there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And she was brought there to the chamberlain. Amen. Into the king's chamber, directed there. And then then they say, right, &gt;&gt; he was she was taught what to do. And then he leaves her right there. And then it's a private affair. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because they must come. That's what the fible ministry is doing. It's connecting you with him. &gt;&gt; And when you come to him, that is between you and God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That no pastor, no evangelist, no teacher, no prophet can give you that that that personal relationship. &gt;&gt; You've got to have that connection yourself with God. &gt;&gt; You've got to have that intimate relationship with Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Therefore, when you're praying when you when you pray for a need, you don't pray as if you're disconnected from him. &gt;&gt; You've got to have relationship with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to have a relationship, it means you must you you must uh you you you must be familiar with him. &gt;&gt; You must be spending time with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, there's no bond there. Now, you know, if somebody has a relationship, if they don't spend time together, there's no bond between them. &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine you're not spending time with Christ, you don't have you don't read your Bible, you don't pray or you there's no personal time with him. Leave your time when you're coming to church and meeting people. Come with your private time, your own relationship with Christ. If you don't have that, you don't have a bond with him. &gt;&gt; So when you pray, you find that your prayer is so disconnected from him &gt;&gt; because there's no relationship there. But when you have a relationship with him, when you're praying, you know that you're speaking directly to him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what the five ministry is placing you in all these things is is is placing you in your connection with him. The word has come to connect you with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you find that when you have this connection with him now, it's an intimacy. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this union must produce fruit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not stillborns, not creeds, but manifested sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because why? She's impregnated with his seed. When you come to union, you get impregnated with his seed. And then what you do, you're producing his very life. &gt;&gt; Not in not not talking about a life that he wants to produce in this day. Amen. Not speaking about another man's uh &gt;&gt; another man's history or another man's testimony, your own testimony in this day. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we find that God's spiritual temple. Amen. It has now come. It's now come to a completion. Amen. There's no other age. &gt;&gt; The headstone has come down. The fact that the headstone has come down, there's no other age. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it means the temple is completed. &gt;&gt; Because if the temple wasn't completed, he wouldn't come to connect with it. Amen. But he comes now to come to give to the Holy Ghost can come and dwell in us. Where now he got a place to a spiritual house to dwell in. He got a spiritual house where he can now move through a people. He can now he got a people that must be surrendered to him &gt;&gt; so much healed to him submitted to him the words. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That now he can work through you. &gt;&gt; He can direct you. He can guide you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now the world is moving so fast. man's agenda. The pastor Adrian just mentioned in the briefly in the beginning that about what's happening in right now that God don't work with the gentile and the Jews simultaneously which is correct because right now among in the gentile world which is closing up now this is a winding up time. Um have you ever seen in the history of any US president so much things are happening so rapidly &gt;&gt; so many meetings with so many world powers so rapidly &gt;&gt; all is not happening for nothing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Things are winding up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So if things are happening rapidly like that you think the holy the angel of God is not fixing things. &gt;&gt; He's fixing things all over. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. is going to bring you in rapidly. Amen. He's going to bring you up to pace. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; With his agenda. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? Eventually the gospel must go back to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have much time left. The time that we've got left now, we just waiting for that last few to come up now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To come up into the headstone. So we're not talking about a theory. Amen. Because this is the complete completion of the temple where Christ is fully expressed in his body. &gt;&gt; You know that was Christ the mercy of God revealed. Amen. Where all that was in God he poured into Christ. All that was in Christ he poured into his church. Christ must be fully expressed through you and I. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Ephesians 2:20 and 22 says, "And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together grow into an holy temple in the Lord." So this manifestation now of all the lively stones is the completion of this temple and Christ is fully expressed. Now this is not a theory. Amen. This is not some just some teaching or something. It's an actual thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and God is the one that's bringing it up to speed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, we could have we could have wondered how is people going to be brought up to speed to come up to now into that level. &gt;&gt; God is the one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; He's the one that bringing the people up to speed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But through the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, this is not a gospel where you can just take it and say, "I will just sit at home and I will read it for myself and I will hear from the Lord myself." &gt;&gt; Then we out of scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We're out of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to conform to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this is not a theory, but it's a manifestation. Signs and wonders, character, and divine nature, the divine nature of Christ flowing through this body. Yes. &gt;&gt; Signs and wonders are following the believers. &gt;&gt; People are looking for sign, but it's happening. &gt;&gt; It's happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's happening behind closed doors. &gt;&gt; Because it's not a public show. &gt;&gt; And the character of the believers is such they're not going to make they're not going to put a big thing about it &gt;&gt; because it's just part of the nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The supernatural is is part of the nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. Experiencing the supernatural is part of the nature. This is not some denomination when when some small thing happen they make a big thing out of it &gt;&gt; as if it's a circus or some show. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is not a show. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are just living out the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are just living out our part of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what makes us walk in perfect faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says if you go to the set of the perfect man paragraph 360 he says so when you surrender paragraph 360 I'll just wait for Amen. So he says, "So when you surrender your complete being, then the Holy Spirit just pours through you." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In these virtues, then you a living tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Then people look out and say, "That's a man full of virtue, knowledge. He believes the word, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, full of the love of the Holy Ghost." See there he's walking around. What is it? a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian. There is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about. You never seen a kinder, sweeter, godlier person. You're sealed. A seal shows on both sides. Whether you're going or coming, you see the seal just the same. There you are. See, when a man or woman possess this, then the capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God, which is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the word coming from here manifest itself &gt;&gt; through each one of these beings. &gt;&gt; See, and make this complete being, a tabernacle of the living God, a working living example of Christianity. What Christ was, these people are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because his life is in here. They are in Christ and their life is dead and hidden Christ through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost. 1 Corinthians 12. That's right. You reckon yourself dead. Then you're born of faith. Then virtue and these other things is added to you till you are a perfect living image of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the world will be confounded because there might have been critics about this message. Critics of why this people believe say there was a certain prophet who says that he came with a message of God. They might have criticized that through the years and all his ages. But the vindication that he kept packed with a message from God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That seven angels came from another world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That come with a message. Angels packed this message. Amen. &gt;&gt; The vindication of that is a people on the earth coming into the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. For no theology, no man-made teaching will bring anybody on the earth, any human being on the earth into the image of Christ, but a message that comes directly from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A message that come from the throne room of God. Because what was lost in the garden of Eden, the title that Adam and Eve, Adam lost, has come down in this day into the rightful owners again. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the very spirit that Adam had, the true spirit that he lost out there, the Holy Ghost has come back upon the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It why now the Holy Ghost now people speak they think by manifesting gifts of the Holy Ghost they have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But give them the word test. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And see if they believe the word. They say yes we believe the word. All right. Fine. See if that word remains fresh. Because when you got the Holy Ghost himself, the person of the Holy Ghost, the manner must be fresh all the time. &gt;&gt; You won't be eating word of another day. Amen. You won't be speaking about a stale word. You will understand your word in this time and season. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. And you'll move with the agenda of God because sons and daughters of God must be about the father's business. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know in the story of Esther, she was prepared. Her first time that she had to be with the king, the f the first time for the king to encounter her, she had to be prepared first. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oils, perfumes, and garments given by the king's chamberlain, she was like typed by the bride, prepared by the Holy Spirit. But there was another time by another chamberl. Amen. M &gt;&gt; when she had to enter the king's presence. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where she could now experience now unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where she could receive grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; In this day, grace, grace. The headstone come comes down crying grace. Grace, unmmerited favor. Amen. Now, as she went at that stage, when she could now go into the king's presence, Amen. and receive this unmmerited favor, it brought forth deliverance to a people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Likewise, when we come into a union, Amen. and manifest his life because that's what she did. When she comes to a union, which means she comes now into a marriage union with a king. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. where he could come to intimacy with her and reproduce his life. &gt;&gt; So likewise the bride now in a union when you come with Christ in such a union and you manifest his life and you are now have the opportunity by manifesting his life it is bringing deliverance to the entire creation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? By you coming to a union with Christ into wonders with him and reproducing his life sons of God upon the earth again. Amen. You are now bringing deliverance to to creation. Let's go to scripture. Romans 8:19. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do sons of God come into manifestation? You had to come into a union. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come into uni and reproduce Christ again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it couldn't happen in any other age. But it had to happen in the age when the when the when the body is ready now it's owned so much like him into his very image the edstone had to come down. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to come into such a union with him and to to get into the union you had to come to his chamber. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You was living nicely under the message of the hour &gt;&gt; enjoying all the precious uh eating from the seven cause meal of the message of the hour enjoying the benefits of this word. Amen. But you have to come now come up higher. &gt;&gt; Come into the inner chamber. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come into intimacy to reproduce his very life. &gt;&gt; The life upon life. That's why now you are moving from grace unto grace. From glory unto glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That the very nature and attributes of Christ must be manifested. Therefore, you're finding now signs and wonders are following the believer. Therefore, you're finding testimony after testimony. The supernatural is happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In every area of your life, you are watching testimonies. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In every area of your life, you're not we're not uh God is not limited to only certain part maybe just healing to every part of your life. &gt;&gt; He's concerned about the affairs of man &gt;&gt; and espe especially the you sons and daughters of God. He's concerned about you in every Don't think you can go and shed a tear without God knowing about it. &gt;&gt; Don't think you cry in silence. &gt;&gt; Don't think you go with your worry and doubt. He doesn't know about it. &gt;&gt; Cast your cares upon him for he cared for you. &gt;&gt; But in his hour, you got to be certain about God. &gt;&gt; And in his hour, you got to be connected with him. That when you pray, you're not praying to a distant person. You are praying to someone you have a relationship with you, someone that you bonded with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Some other quotes. &gt;&gt; In the message, Jesus keeps all his appointment. It says, "And the capstone that goes upon the pyramid, it was rejected. It was never on the pyramid. Isn't until this day. &gt;&gt; The stone of stone, they claim, the stone of scone, they claim, but it never was put on. They kept stone. Why? When Enoch and them in the early days build a pyramid down in Egypt, we find out and in there they knew that the cornerstone, the capstone would be rejected and that pyramid is put so perfectly together till they don't need mortar. It was so mechanically hooed out until one stone fits against the other one. So tight you can't even put a razor blade between them. Now just keep heaping up and now it's all owned off on top ready for the capstone when it will come. That's the way God has brought his church from justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Spirit. And now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the word that ministry in the church will have to be just exactly like he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So no way it can be anyhow any other way. It's got to be exactly manifesting him. Amen. &gt;&gt; His very image. He says in the message the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride. He says now notice how beautiful. And in this pyramid we see seven steps and then the king's chamber. And we're in the seven church age before the king takes his throne. So you see what he's saying? You got to recognize when he when he's speaking and what year he's speaking it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the king takes his throne. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So if that was a seven church age then as a seven church age but now we've come now to the headstone because before he's crowned we it is a bride that will crown him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's the queen that's going to crown him. &gt;&gt; So he's before he comes and reign as king. He has to come into a union. He has to come into a marriage. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has to come into a Christ has to come into a marriage with his brides. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So only when he comes into a marriage with a bride now is ready to go and set up his kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now therefore now he can come we can crown him king of kings, &gt;&gt; lord of lords. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And remember the pyramid never did have a capstone on it.
