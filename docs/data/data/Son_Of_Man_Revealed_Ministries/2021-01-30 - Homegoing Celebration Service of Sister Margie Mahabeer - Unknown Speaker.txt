========================================

amen and god takes away life the bible says through everything there's a season there's a time there's a purpose under the heavens amen we will answer amen amen we'd like to take our scripture reading this day from the book of first days scripture says that you saw or not even as others which have no hope so that's a christian sorrow amen it says be sorry not even as others who have no hope though we will miss our sister that we will enlist our mom amen and may be heartbreaking at times but our sorrow is with hope amen jesus christ amen for we believe that jesus died and rose again even to them who told us to sleep in jesus will god bring with him for we say this unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them who shall sleep for the lord himself shall be sent from heaven with a shout amen [Music] amen shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen let's powerful pray our loving heavenly father lord your grace words we cannot fathom over it's truly an unmerited favor oh god when we look back on our lives it's nothing we have done nothing we've deserved oh god but it was only by your grace father we looked through life and saw how you let us do lord and you brought us away from different backgrounds maybe trapped in hedonism and catholicism and all different kinds of religions but she led us so faithfully oh god and you brought us to the same knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ we thank you for your love and your mercy this day father and we thank you lord jesus even as we come to our last respect to the mortal remains of our dear sister yoga we pray lord that you reveal the family lord and grant them peace and comfort at this time oh god and we pray over everything that will be said and done today oh god bless the heroes of the world and i pray lord that your mighty angel will come down and speak oh god for the words of life to give us hope and account for the lord jesus we commit everything to your hands in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen a faithful godly christian wife a mother a sister a friend we can see the grace of our lord jesus christ upon the family that has given them peace amen a peace that passes all human understanding and we know that jesus said that the comforter the holy spirit will come amen and give us that comfort that we need many thoughts will be shared today and as we amen and we can say many things but the most important thing that our life and that testimony speaks louder than anything that we could ever say amen she was full of the spirit of god and life of christ the life of christ was reflected through her amen our journey beyond any shadow of doubt we know that this beautiful godly mother sister maggie has certainly made this preparation and right now she is in the place that she has prepared to go [Music] [Music] but the lord chose to call him about three weeks ago and with the ramesh and his family have made it faithful serving the lord in the message of the hour they've been faithful to the fellowship faithful to the believers they never wavered in serving the lord brother is one who has the spirit of praise upon him amen is always praising the lord and trust in the lord and thanking the lord no matter how big the situation is you'll always hear me praising the lord sister maggie himself was a true worshiper jesus at one time i told the woman the father is seeking those that will worship him in spirit and truth and i believe our sister mahdi was such a worshiper she worshipped the lord in spirit and himself amen and if given an opportunity all of us would like to look beyond the curtain of time [Music] amen saying this is what you preach about pastor ronnie amen and we're so glad that you came so that we can make it to this place amen get a glimpse into that sixth dimension because man has always had three questions like the prophet of god says amen those three questions are where did i come from who am i and where am i going and he says [Music] amen so we'd like to answer some of these questions very briefly and very quickly amen where do i come from tells us in ephesians 1 and verse 4 that we were chosen in christ amen from before the foundation of the world before god created the heavens and the earth we existed in his eternal thoughts amen our lord jesus told us in john 13 verse 3 that he came from god and he went back to god the lord jesus christ was taken from his very own side amen so if he came from god and bring it back to god then we came from are going back god god amen genesis 1 27 says god created man in his own image [Music] amen god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them we want to declare this morning [Music] amen so you ought to be thankful to the lord amen but there must be preparations made for her [Music] i'm sure that all of us do the same amen when we are expecting to receive a child into this world there is a great amount of planning and preparations made and as good as into this world how much more preparation does our heavenly father make amen god for every one of us amen god is here for his specific purpose and the purpose of god will never be defeated [Music] [Music] amen we know that man is a spirit we place so much emphasis on the human flesh by the real you many of us have never met never seen amen because man is a spirit he possesses ugly experience [Music] body we are taught when the mind is ready to deliver the baby the spirit of god is with the spirit of the sister each and every one of us waiting to enter that body [Music] amen so to answer the question very briefly where do i come from [Music] amen and all those that receive jesus christ [Music] moving on to the next question who am i romans 18 verse 14 says so as many as led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whether we were spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children their ears is our god and joins us with christ he shall be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together ephesians 1 and verse 5 says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will and the apostle paul admonishes us knowing not you are the temple of god and the spirit of god dwelleth in you so we are really sons and daughters of the most high god many people make pilgrimages they go to asia they go to the buddhist place trying to find where they came from try to find some peace but the bible has all the answers amen you may have been born towards your parents they may have given you your name not even took care of you raise you up in the ways of the lord [Music] amen [Music] [Music] amen he repeatedly started to reveal himself to us amen there came a certain point when god started to reveal himself to you and every person must come to understand that we were born in sin shitty we came into [Music] [Music] physical but eternal separation from god so as we begin to grow all these things seem strange to us when we came across the word of god we heard the first sermon preached [Music] [Music] [Music] amen then we see the spirit of god the holy spirit [Music] [Music] with that purpose in mind she served a husband because only the world taught her how to be sufficient amen with that purpose in three mind daughters amen and the prophet god tells us the mother is that full gospel amen growing up the children probably don't read the first four gospels maybe they can't understand it or comprehend it but the mother has a way of raising them up in the ways of the lord she becomes gospel teaching the children at home amen instilling godly values within them [Music] she was submissive and loyal to her husband as she raised the children in the ways of the lord we come to our final question where am i going where am i going but now you know that if you are following the lord jesus christ we only want to go where he leads us but we want to get our answers from the bible so in john 14 2 says in my father's house are many mansions there are many theories [Music] that's where we're going where he is there we will be also amen revelation 14 13 says and i heard a voice from heaven to me right bless another day which died in the world from henceforth yesterday the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their words amen to follow them their words to follow them because you are not you do not go in and buy your words you go to heaven by the grace of our lord and save jesus christ that is why the bible is so clear the words follow them the words didn't go before them and say it's because of this thing i've done it one year there's so many people that the lord is choosing to call home at this time people made this thing sweeping the earth it's a plague that's going around them you know they talk about peter standing at the gates of heaven and welcoming people in but suddenly now there seems to be a great influx into him but i want you to know that david was not [Music] together but god is in control of all things i'd like to take you to that place if i can for just a minute of where our sister is [Music] to get to space they launched a man up in a rocket and put launching into space they imagine they knew that whoever which space first would be the next superpower then it was a quest to go to the moon amen they were looking for life in other planets they were looking for extraterrestrial activity ufos unidentified flying objects amen but while they were launching man into space and launching man to the moon god had a prophet on the earth and god took him to that real place he met the place the man was seeking for they were eternal place where there was life god took this prophet [Music] [Music] entering that sixth dimension he said that i looked at young women maybe in the early 18-20 [Music] they were throwing their arms around him and screaming our precious brother he says here come young men i want you to notice his description now in the brilliance of young men their eyes glistening and looking like stars in a darkened night their teeth as white as pearl and they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming all our precious brother he says there was no yesterday not tomorrow if there's no yesterday and no tomorrow then that's eternity there's no time there they didn't get tired he said i've never seen such pretty woman in all my life and as beautiful as sister maggie is right here she's in the brilliance of the huge right now he says i've never seen such pretty women in all my life they had hair down to their waistline long skirts to their feet and they were just funny he says i don't have the vocabulary [Music] he said and he heard the angel telling this is what you preached was the holy ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it he says [Music] sister maggie has gone back to eternity like jesus said i go to prepare a place for you in my father's house are many mansions theories celestial bodies perfect bodies in closing we'd like to read this scripture that's fitting for our sister and i was not aware that they had printed it on the front cover of this proverbs chapter 31 he says who can find a virtuous woman for her christ is far above rubies the heart of her husband don't safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do it good and not evil all the [Music] strength and honor are a clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she voted with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she looked well into the ways of our household and eaten not the greater idealness a children arise up and call her blessed a husband also a praiser [Music] amen it says many daughters have done virtuously is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feared the lord she shall be praised and let words praise them in the gates our own words testify for our own life testify our experience with the lord jesus christ and our sister margie has been a dear faithful sister in the house of the lord she married the lord she made jesus a lord and savior and she chose to form him to sickness to health amen through any situation and she never pursued this message of the hour she loved the message and i believe he was a brave woman amen she always taught the children to pray and trust the lord and seek the face of the lord so we remember the words of david after he had lost his son he said i cannot go to him or sorry he cannot come to me but i can go to him so having asked us three questions where did you come from who are you and where are you going do you know the lord jesus christ jesus was very explicit there's not many ways that lead to god i want to declare to you there is only one way to heaven must enter through christ so even as we close now we want to leave you with those thoughts if you truly want to know where you came from who you are and where you are going to come to jesus you will find all the answers that you need amen let us stand together as we honor a life and celebrate our life we thank you for the word once again we know lord our sister rejoice in the word o god and we pray lord that you are blessed to the people's heart and lord if there's somebody here that is seeking you lord i pray that you may find you lord jesus we cover the servants with your hands over everything that will be sent down today in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ for your glory and for your honor amen yes [Music] hey [Music] and [Music] [Music] oh [Music] me [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] once again [Music] as well as the family members please adhere to that amen at this time we'd like to call really our dear sister on the k-9 [Music] speech good afternoon ladies and gentlemen thank you well missions all of you are present here it is it's an awful sad day today but at the same time we are celebrating the life i can you marty from the time you were little you grew up in a place called greenstown we lived in the same street and margie when you look at her you know she always had the smile in fact [Music] [Music] [Music] about how much he came from but he was afraid to approach her towards the family to ask for any marriage ramesh was brought up by a single man so i recall the day mark even spoke to me said you know what why don't you bring her and come home so we can ask for him and we did that so i acted as a brother and a friend but at the same in time his proposal was done and she was so happy mark is a person that curtailed a schooling career because she brought up with a very large family of 12 children and a the water wasn't always on tap and this monster had a lot of clothes and she still very young she could wash all the clothes at night she really gave herself to her you know the parents in the household and then she also learned her phone but in terms of the culinary challenge she could cook very well and i don't mind if he was a sample of cooking he'll always want to take more at the end of the day she always believed in the lord she believed in the lord she worshipped the lord there's any thanksgiving service that takes place and you know if it was most substituted in that service most of us about these conversations that she had she always visited my wife and sister veronica almost on a weekly basis and when i retired i managed to sit in conversations with them and eventually always this assurance she took the rightful steps to move in that direction and you said the steps of the righteous are directed by the lord and margie hoped in these steps she was a good example i mean to her children in one line she created such a sure foundation such a base for the children that you know they served a lot and nothing way was that she went through throughout the tribulations that she was overcomer because she took advice from the bible the scripture scripture and if you look at the children [Music] she was a motherly figure even my wife says you know that mahdi was a sister to her but she regards her as a second mother during you know the times so they're quite heartbroken but at the same time they have this blessed assurance of jesus the lord absolutely the present spirit with the lord i know that all of you knew her the words that come [Music] because rejoicing in the presence is jesus christ believe this morning we are getting the pleasures of the lord and the bible says i feel like to start my i won't say a tribute i say absolutely my dear wonderful sister the scripture reading is on ii corinthians 12 9 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for me for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore would i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ will rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities and persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am me then i am strong i believe these are the ones even when paul was alive when he looked upon death he said where is your sting oh great where morning i can say is same for my dear sister madi because growing up i always took as my dear sister in the lord because she was instrumental in me coming to know the lord and especially this message she was the one that especially they uh took me to the centers where a minister was teaching from america and they we had fellowship with her for two days two nights three nights in fact over the video called and someone that is sick you could see the joy of the lord she was actually praising god lifting her hands singing and she told me jerry i am not sick god has healed me and god has delivered me and in this body i've made my peace with god the last the sunday the last we had their service over there she said goodbye and i believe in my heart that my sister knew that she was foreign is his word and his lord brings life his word brings peace his life with joy and my sister mahdi adverted to the qualifications even before she got sick and she met the first time i had a pudding that she made this christmas and she gave me such a huge piece to take over and uh [Music] she loved their plants none of the nature that god puts in someone is where they can have the spirit to love nature and that was such a loving character that you know the character speaks louder than words you know i like them for god you don't have to preach you just have to know that what makes the devil a chamber for christ and i thank she had three daughters and these daughters were the love of her life together she was the foundation of that home she really prayed and in the services ramesh will be in the front of the teacher serving and praising the lord and when they got married he married two sons in fact maggie never regarded her son she took them as their sons and i'd like those voices marcus everything amen in fasting i'd like to say this brother is here you got the place that our jesus stays called the scripture says i am not seen entered into the yeah of man what god is instead of us so we have a blessed hope we don't look at the body because god gave us the following spirit but he gave us a soul and one thing about the soul that belongs to god and the devil can do anything the day my sister died you know there was such a beautiful weather it actually rained god blessed the earth and you know the blessings even the weather we have throughout this time that she she went on to be with the lord it's such a beautiful day that god has blessed us before she even left to the hospital she took her time he always takes the time anything she does she has very slowly doing anything she's not a person and she took a church she made the evidence late [Music] and this morning we are rejoicing because you know we can see the fruits we can look at what god has done and we can rejoice because we serve a god of friends amen you know as you all do everything in your power do everything in your power forsake everything and live for christ surrender your life give your heart to the lord jesus [Music] and that hope is believing his word you know the prophet our lord and savior jesus christ he said i wrote the word i am in the world and he wants us to believe them that's why the prophets think so only to me only believe all things are possible and i believe that we will see on but she's rejoicing holding amen god bless you i have to put on my [Music] uh [Music] is [Music] i believe so uh [Music] very beautiful and faithful [Applause] is [Music] others no matter who it was mom you are such a beautiful friend you were beautiful inside and out you always talk to us things like granny chicken and cries when you meet breakfast the father goes [Music] [Music] [Music] the thing that made you the most happy was praising god you sang songs and prayed when you thanked you all i loved it knowing you was the but best know [Music] whenever someone [Music] [Music] she always wished to worry [Music] she was happy to see she always used to go to shelves she loved to be [Music] jesus

it won't be long we'll be going on so count the years as much [Music] and compromise as we and cut the weeks as days any day now we'll be going on [Music] a man i greet you once again in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ before i read the portion of scripture and encourage you on god's word i just like to say a few words on behalf of the fellowship son of man revealed ministries of our dear sister magi as i was saying yesterday to the family when we had a zoom memorial con meeting our sister margie was a very faithful sister she loved the lord she loved to be in fellowship she's a sister that you didn't have to foster to be in church she loved to be in fellowship with all the believers and one thing about her if she was in fellowship you will notice that she's there because she was a very vocal sister in the way she worshipped god she wasn't ashamed of who was around her whenever the worship was there she loved to praise and worship she loved to worship god she loved your aim and the word so i know today all the worship she done to her savior all the rejoicing she's done when the praise and worship was going on every time she amended that word and believed it all that she believed now she's rejoicing in it now she's reaping the benefits of what she believed she had the inheritance amen an inheritance is in christ jesus and indeed she was a a woman that you can describe the book of prophet described a woman that was faithful to a husband a woman that was true to a family a woman that raised up a children in the ways of the lord and a woman that also loved you can see so much of love in her because whenever grandchildren she brought them to church you could say the way she carries the way she carry on with the grandchildren the way she embraced them and make them sit on her and keep them with her she was always excited when they were around she loved the grandchildren she loved the children she loved the family and indeed she would be missed by all of them but we thank god that they all also believe they believe in what she believed in they we have the same blessed hope that she has amen and it won't be long as we sang that song one of these days there's going to be a resurrection that's the promise of god's word the bible says the lord himself shall descent from heaven with a shout amen and she believed the shout already which was the message that came in a day and the next thing to take place is the resurrection that's what we're waiting for that's the next event to take place because the cycle of the rapture has already begun and our sister was caught up in that cycle of the rapture already and the next event to take place is when we're gonna see our dear sister raised up again and all believers of like precious faith right down to all the seven church ages all the saints will be raised up that's the event to take place on the earth and that's the hope that this family is resting on today and as you'll hear today from the many testimonies our prayer our sister was a prayer warrior a prayer a sister that didn't always love intercession interceded for a family and i'm sure to i'm sure they will continue in that they will continue in what she has left them and molded them into as we read god's word because i believe there's no other encouragement that we can get for but god's word the bible says let every man's word be a lie but my word be the truth amen the bible in first corinthians chapter 15 reading from verse 12 it says now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection after the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith also vain yay and we found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith is in vain yea yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished if in this life only we have opened christ we are of all men most miserable but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for sins by man came dead by man also the resurrection of the dead for as in the in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the first fruits afterward they are christ at his coming then come at the end when he shall have devil delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for we must reign till he had put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is dead for he had put all things under his feet but when he said all things are put under him it is manifest that he expect accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be in all else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead amen we thank god that we have a revelation that christ is risen from the dead and for the past 2000 years we've seen the power of the resurrection of jesus christ and one day at lazarus tomb when jesus raised lazarus from the dead he said marvel lot is this one of these days all his graves shall be opened up one of these days not only in the days of lazarus he had to mention lazarus name and said lazarus comfort if he just said come forth he was the power of the resurrection he was the resurrection and the life the whole graves would have opened up but he said lazarus come forth but one of these days all these graves of believers of like precious fate is going to be opened up oh and say now we can say oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory for those that are died in christ that corruption will put on incorruption that's the promise we have in god's word and that's why we have a hope and sorrow not like those who don't believe for we know that the dead in christ shall rise first amen we're going to pray now and we're going to open the open the casket for viewing and we we ask that first we'll allow the immediate family to view then we'll ask those that didn't have a chance to view and then one more one last time we'll open again for the immediate family we can ask our brother adrian to pray [Music] our dear lord jesus we come before you once again we thank you lord for everything you've done thus far today oh god lord we sense your presence we sense your peace oh god and we know the strength that you have given us today comes from you lord jesus and one more time we call upon your name and we pray father even as we open the casket lord to view the mortal remains of our dear sister for one
