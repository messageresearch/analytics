hallelujah and he's got a mighty people on the Earth amen a mighty marching Army Hallelujah an invading Army amen that's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen we have some visitors here amen we got Brother David here amen with his uh is Judea did I get the name right amen and we got brother darl visiting here this morning with his family welcome amen let's give them a hand welcome them the bonden bless you amen so some of you would know what's going on I was telling brother the Tyson what's going on and I was telling brother the Sam amen but I'll tell you some other time praise the Lord amen amen because the moving of the holy spirit is different to our kindal thinking amen so we just got to watch how we amen cooperate with the Holy Spirit this morning amen because we don't want to be leading ourselves the Holy Ghost was sent to lead and guide the church so I'm going to take a topic that may seem unfamiliar to you uh or maybe just a title and I want to title it the Philadelphia Corridor amen and you'll see why because there are terrorists within our territory that's trying to inade our borders of the message of the hour and take Souls captive amen but there's a strategic point you know we've been speaking on uh maintaining borders and strengthening our borders amen the opening up of spiritual Frontiers so there are certain Frontiers we must maintain which is the Philadelphia Corridor amen hallelujah I know that sounds like a military language to us this morning amen but just amen I don't even know how I'm going to say it or what I'm going to come across as but you just leave it to the Holy Spirit and let him work amen remember the natural types of spiritual and then he says USA is the type of Israel as well amen praise the Lord so just keep these things in mind if we can just go to a few scriptures this morning amen just to get our scripture reading then you can be seated praise the Lord hallelujah everybody love the Lord amen hallelujah we can go to um The Book of Matthew chapter 15 oh sorry before we go there amen maybe we'll just read another portion of scripture just to get you seated and then we'll read those scriptures amen let's read 1 Peter 5: 6 and 11 uh 211 1 Peter chapter 5 you see this is what we need to start to do and verse 6 says humble yourselves amen humble yourselves there for under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time amen amen casting all your care upon him for he carth for you oh yes amen amen then he goes on to say be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are com accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who had called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that he have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen praise the Lord then we want to read 1 Corinthians 10:3 sorry sorry one 2 Corinthians chapter 10 2 Corinthians chapter 10 amen we can read from verse three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty notice now the Holy Spirit picked up words now we spoke about a mighty God Amen we just read out God is mighty here and we said he's got a mighty Army but now he's also got another word called Mighty amen But Mighty through God so the weapons are even mighty to the pulling down of strongholds yes amen now remember Gaza is called strong is a strong City it's a stronghold right and Hamas is violence the word of m means violence and Gaza means stronghold praise the Lord I'm just showing you the natural there what's happening amen Mighty to through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen so what we spoke last week you got to take the word to the Battleground because in the in the mind is where Satan is coming that's the corridor he's trying to invade so we got to take the word to the Battleground and having in Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled you may be seated the Lord at blessings to the read of his word very quickly we'll go to Ephesians chap 6 verse2 amen Ephesians 6 and: 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen hallelujah so the battle is taking place in high places therefore God wants us and he's called us into Heavenly places to strategically position ourselves to defeat the enemy can you say Amen to that amen amen hallelujah now it's important in this hour to walk in obedience right you remember Saul didn't walk in obedience to the word and if we go brother brother Josh you very quickly to 1 Samuel 15 verse 22-23 it says and Samuel said at the Lord as great Delight in birth offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to arken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as a sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou rejected the word of the Lord he has also rejected thee from being King amen hallelujah now if we flip that into the uh other positive point is if we have accepted the word of the Lord then he has appointed us as his Queen am amen he rejected Saul because he rejected the word and he rejected him from being King so we know the denominational world has been rejected amen God has rejected them because they have rejected the word but a people have come through a corridor have come through a passage way that's been made for them amen because all of the P cankerworm Locust and caterpillar has eaten God says I will restore am amen and God started the restoration by opening up a frontier opening up a passageway for us through Luther and he opened up the first work of Grace which was called justification now remember as we've been teaching you that Luther brought the word justification but he didn't get the full revelation of the word amen but when brother brandham comes and he is to reveal all Mysteries he takes that word justification and he magnifies that word justification and he says justification he says though you've never done it in the first place he says in the Rapture message now standing there to be married to the Son of God Amen Hallelujah so justification moves you past forgiveness of sins and it's as though you've never sinned in the first place hallelujah amen thank so if you've never sinned in the first place then God has cast it into the sea of forgetfulness amen hallelujah so brother brand magnify justification he he tied up the loose hand and he brought the true meaning of justification it's as though you've never sinned in the first place so your first birth was analed God don't consider your first birth if you are born again you are born again amen your past is taken care of thank you Lord then brother Brandon comes we know now we're talking about the Philadelphia Corridor and I'll tell you why just now but he says uh Wesley opened up another passage way he took it past Luther amen and he brought the message of sanctification hallelujah amen he brought that message of sanctification but brother it wasn't just amen the blood of Jesus and good works like the Methodist Church thought must do now they said feed the hungry amen clothe the poor and visit those that I need in hospitals in prison they went on a method but brother Bram comes and he takes sanctification because he's the the eagle of the age and he zooms into sanctification and he talks about the blood he says the literal life of the the literal blood dried up but the life that was in the blood amen has come upon the believer in the form of the Holy Ghost and then he says then you are Sanctified amen how by the Holy Ghost sanctification amen then we know the passage way is made up now William Simo and all of these people start in the zza Street Revival pushing the B ERS pushing the territory forward amen amen what is it advancing the kingdom of God moving with the holy spirit amen then they denominated and they said the initial evidence is speaking in tongues but now the Propet to the age the eye of the age comes and says it's beyond speaking in tongues he moved the Holy Ghost interpretation from Beyond speaking in tongues amen hallelujah he showed you how the angel of God is the Holy Ghost amen he took it further Hallelujah he showed you the movings of the Holy Ghost he taught us these things higher dimensions in the Holy Ghost until he brought it to such an elevated level where he says you receiving the word for your age in your time and your season that's the true evidence that you have received the Holy Ghost hallelujah what is it magnifying the borders amen enlarging our borders enlarging our understanding amen taking away the trinitarian doctrine amen and bringing the true revelation of the godhead how God condescended from Spirit to word to flesh amen amen hallelujah how we bypassed our theop body and now we are going back amen from flesh will connect with our theophany body and go back to that word body amen a glorified body praise the Lord so we have to be mindful of the movings of the Holy Ghost and now he says when the church has shut the door Lan church has shut the door yes amen amen they shut the door but we know that God opened the door in that sixth Church age he said I've set before you an Open Door amen but latest year in church shut the door but there's got to be a people who go to reopen that door amen amen hallelujah amen that have not denominated oh yes a mighty Army has risen up Amen to take back oh yes Lord to destroy the works of the enemy now if you remember last week I that's why I say sometimes we we do things we say things without knowing what we are doing but we are following the leadings of the Holy Spirit and I took a scripture and I showed you how David went to rescue hostages his wife and children and all the these men were taken hostage their wives were taken hostage then then when we go home you see that Israel also found hostages they found six hostages right amen but if you go and magnify that story and read that story you'll see exactly what is happening now amen and we read there how the Lord told David to go and pursue the enemy right oh yes to utterly slay and Destroy amen yes Lord hallelujah yeah now you would know that October 7th amen started a persecution upon the Jews one like they've never seen since the Holocaust praise the Lord amen amen you know that they were terrorist and camped within the land of Israel called the Gaza Strip yeah and they were using there as underground tunnels now I'm not just trying to bring politics into this I'm showing you that in spiritual Israel terrorist have infiltrated the ranks underground channels launching attacks strategic attacks amen praise the Lord amen when the devil tried to take away the gifts the moving of the Holy Spirit from the church the church stayed quiet if the devil said no more speaking in tongues no more praying for the sick intellectual Giants Rose and listen to that word now I love you know Mark 16 is not just about healing alone put up Mark 16 brother as soon as you say Mark 16 people try to think it's it's a BL it's a healing of the sick alone I'll show it's for the Deliverance of the Sons and Daughters of God Amen praise the Lord so Mark 16 amen we can put from verse uh maybe from 13 14 somewhere there okay uh maybe 15 I think it is he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature right he that believeth and baptized shall be saved how many if you can see salvation there am so when you say Mark 16 people just think oh he's trying to trying to operate a gift Mark 16 is talking about preaching the gospel those that believe being baptized and you carrying the true revelation of baptism will baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ am amen he that believeth not shall be damned so he's bringing condemnation as well so there's more to Mark 16 than just what we think and these signs shall follow them that believe number one in my name they shall cast out devils and I think that's what's probably the problem they don't want us to cast out Devils maybe we need to cast out religious demons amen [Music] amen amen in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues amen oh there's more now there's not just healing here I if you can see that amen it's a casting out of devils it's a speaking with new tongues amen they shall take up serpents amen and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them now at the end they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so don't try and make Mark 16 just a healing scripture it's for the Deliverance amen of a person for the Salvation of a person amen for the healing of a person yes praise the Lord I if you know Deliverance of spirits he going beyond the healing of the flesh he going to the spirit realm Hallelujah and how many of you know Salvation is going beyond the spirit realm and going into the realm of the Soul amen so I'll take you into a deeper meaning of Mark 16 and show you it's dealing with Body Spirit and soul amen Wonder praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord and sometimes we do things and maybe thinking it's out of season it's out of time I'll show you amen when people have faith in God God will honor their word God will honor their faith amen what we have is too many backslid people that are satisfied with the status quo and not ready to push the borders of Faith Jesus said when I come back will I find faith on the earth not just sitting around laying idle brother Bram says indoors indoors amen paragraph 87 if you put it up I like a man with vision I like a man with purpose I like a man who knows what he's doing not just laying around sitting saying oh whatever will be will be he says oh be up and add it he says find a purpose and go and do something about it amen thank you Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord yeah for those if you want to read it I like a man of vision I like people that's got something they're fighting for not just laying around well whatever comes along you know we've been along in this Riot so long 30 years 40 years we'll just see what the Lord will do God puts you on the earth to do something about it God has commissioned you under Revelation 108 to11 thou must prophesy again yes Lord thank you Lord amen you keep waiting for God Amen God told the prophet what do you keep waiting around for you remember he was trying to find the vision for sister Wood's mother or mother-in-law and he says I went to the scripture I went to pray and the Lord came back with a sharp word of rebuke why do you keep hanging around why do you keep waiting for me to move he says I've given you my word amen my word is higher than any Vision amen my word is the primary source amen hallelujah amen amen oh be up and at it some of us need to be up and at it this morning some of us need to be up and at it in our lives amen amen have a vision have a purpose for our lives find the vision of God for our lives he says link never had his education but Lincoln never let his education stand in the way so that's no excuse you can't say I've only got a metric I've only got this grade I've got that he said Lincoln never let his education stand in the way if you don't know who Abraham Lincoln is he became the president of the United States amen and I go further to say brother Bram never let his education get in the way he just healed himself to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit had his way with that gift so never let your circumstance govern your future God says I know the plans I have for you say the Lord amen maybe the place you're staying now is not the best of places but have a vision for your future maybe your finances are not in the place it should be but I have a vision for where you want to be you know there's a law on the earth work you reap what you sow if you put your hands Amen to work God will bless the fruits of your hands the labors of your hands we can't have la people amen and then expecting God to pour out blessings amen put your hand to work and God will bless you then you can say like JZ oh God that you would bless me indeed that you would enlarge my borders oh God Amen he says I think every Christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go to it amen amen every member of the chapter oh well we'll have a breakfast once in a month maybe we'll have a combine once once a month you know maybe we'll have open air once every other month he says that isn't it or every Saturday have a purpose in life something you're going to do God has placed you here do something about it come on now you've got a purpose on the earth your purpose is not to Amen to just live and exist on the earth and just eat your purpose is not to eat and go to bed amen come on God placed you here amen if I ask every one of you your purpose now will you be able to tell me what's your purpose glory amen if not then I say we call solom assembly before the Lord Lord what is my purpose show me my purpose amen God plac you here do something about it amen hallelujah he says I have a purpose in life something you're going to do God place you here do something about it every member of every Church there's a Revival in town there is a Revival there for a purpose am let's do something out of let's get something out of it let's do something about it amen now if the bride's Revival is going on he's talking about a Revival how about we get involved in the bright Revival how about we stop being backslid how about we just stop being sitting in the house saying hey I'm comfortable in the message of the hour amen God wants you to be involved in the kingdom of God you ought to be carrying your cross daily amen you ought to be Carrying Your Weapon of Faith daily amen stop waiting for just the minister to do something about it you hear somebody is sick you have faith in your heart to believe God's word you go and you pray amen that's right amen come on now yes amen 200 million demons let loose upon the Earth and Aman melini Hitler that's what the prophet of God says now 200 million demons were let loose but under the fourth seal he says all of Hell follow that fourth hor Rider on the earth now so terrorists are trying to invade do you think they're trying to invade denominational land or you think they're coming here in the message of the hour amen trying to invade our territory amen the Bible declares that the kingdom of God suffered violence amen and he says the violence take it by force so we can't be casual to the enemy we can't be sympath With the Enemy we've got to kill all sin we've got to kill all unbelief amen we've got to connect now with the angel of God Amen for a move of God you find that's why church will just go on in the message of the hour in some places church will just go on because they haven't connected with that Mighty angel that has come down you go there you just hear a sermon being preached amen we'll take this topic today and we preach the revelation of it we go home satisfied thinking oh I'm safe in the confin of the message of the hour God didn't call us to just live in safety God called us out on the battlefield amen you know why people don't talk they're not convinced they're not convinced this is the message of the hour this is the final message now amen the last time I was showing you a journey a passageway from 963 right until the Rapture if the Rapture is here where eternity sets in some people think we are still here on the journey all things continue the same since Brandon fell asleep but we've come now we could be right here now Hallelujah right at the edge ready for the takeoff amen so don't get comfortable amen amen hallelujah I tell you now all nations are ready to turn on Israel right and he says if you want to see the time piece watch Israel watch the fct Tre amen she's about now ready she doesn't know amen all interal pressure coming on International pressure coming upon natural Israel and if you can't see the the physical the the supernatural pressure coming upon spiritual Israel then I say like Elisha said open the boy's eyes amen [Music] amen amen amen praise the Lord our God is King amen our God is King of Kings and Lord of lords let's go to Matthew 15 amen praise the Lord amen now watch you may be thinking why you going there I don't know why I'm going there I'm going to Matthew 15 right now amen praise the Lord maybe it's a spirit saying it's not time and season I don't know maybe you're saying it's not your business I'm going to make it your business this morning yes amen praise the Lord Matthew 15:22 maybe you think God won't answer you God w't hear your prayer maybe you think it's out of season out of time let's see some scriptures and see if God answers out of season out of time and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord th son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil now does that seem like anything wrong the daughter is demon possessed she wants prayer but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him that sounds rude now that sounds rude you're talking to Jesus he doesn't even answer you and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us and he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then she came then then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table amen humble yourself hallelujah amen we read that scripture humble yourself before the Lord amen amen it changes Jesus just declared he's going to change his word now he just said I haven't come for you your Greeks I've come for the L ship of Israel This Woman's response made Jesus change his mind amen oh yes makes him respond out of season it wasn't season for them yet oh yes then Jesus answered and said unto oh woman great is thy faith your faith is going to pull you into season amen amen H amen yes be unto thee even as thou Wilt amen that sounds like Eddie right Hallelujah yes be it unto thee according to thy will as you will and a daughter was made all from that very hour amen praise the Lord yes thank you amen oh he's worthy to be praised amen amen hallelujah our god is King amen let's go to the book of uh Mark amen amen praise the Lord Mark chapter 7 okay sorry that's the same scripture maybe I want to go to another scripture here amen that's just the reading of the same scripture sorry amen let's go to Mark 11 it seems unreasonable for the one who created all things to go and ask for things out of season and yeah verse 13 and seeing a fig tree a far off having leaves he came by Apple he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee thereafter forever and his disciples heard it you know what happened to that tree it withered to the roots I am saying Jesus also understands he can ask for things out of season sir amen hallelujah now that was a a spiritual type there because the victory is Israel and Jesus had come to Israel and they were not bearing fruit yet so didn't they get cursed amen hallelujah so that was just a figurative type there amen praise the Lord amen he's worthy to be praised amen I think it's in the book of Luke one more scripture I want to go to here hallelujah Luke 11 Luke chap 11 verse5 he says and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves now he's going at An Inconvenient hour we can call it out of season right for a friend of mine is in his journey and he's come to me and I have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee so he's already made his declaration a man is as good as his word I say unto you though he will rise not and give him because he is his friend yet because of the importunity he will rise and give him as many as he need and I say unto you ask amen amen and it shall be given to you amen and he that seeketh find it amen and and seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that ask receiveth and he that seeketh find it and to him that knocketh it shall be open if a son shall ask bread of you any of you that is a father will you give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he ask for an egg will he offer him a scorpion if he then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him you see why we have lack in our lives we don't ask if there's anyone in lack here this morning we are not asking the Lord and you know that I think it's in the book of James it says sometimes you ask but you ask a Miss amen the reason why you don't have you ask not and you seek not he says seek now let me declare that that's a law that's a law on the earth God placed that law there ask and you shall receive you can go with that scriptural authority to the Lord and say Lord your word declares ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock when doors are closed behold I set before you an open door he says the door will be open to you I don't care how many doors have closed before you before if you ask in faith now I said even now if you ask in faith every door must come open I speak under the authority of the Angel of the Lord right now every door shall be made Open Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah amen praise the Lord thank you Lord sometimes we don't understand how the Angelic realm is working and how it's going before us and fighting let's just find very quickly what the prophet of God is teaching us about the Angelic realm amen praise the Lord Jesus amen how many if you want to read that thank you amen before we get there I wanted to say this that that woman's hunger amen for bread she said even the dogs eat the bread will pull you out of your season and pull you in the right season you just keep being hungry yes amen amen amen the Lord says you'll feel the hungry blessed are you that hunger and thirst after righteousness for you shall be filled amen amen praise the Lord amen if you go right down to the notes you'll see there's a quote there amen talking about the angel of the Lord so I just want to show you how in a service like this the angel of the Lord is moving right now and connecting with you amen do you have it there amen praise the lord it's one of the last quotes amen praise the Lord and the angel of God which rened before the camp of Israel amen Wednesday we were preaching the mighty Angel is year in our time of trouble amen and we showed you through the scriptures how the prophet took Psalm 27 in the Rapture message to show you that he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the time of trouble so he's showing you even at the Rapture there's a time of trouble and the prophet calls it not a tribulation for the bride but the hour of Temptation amen if we've got time we'll go into some of that the hour of Temptation that has now come upon the bride so I just want you to to understand brother Joshua amen you brothers and sisters that are here how the angel of God is moving and what he's doing amen he's very involved in our lives yes amen but sometimes he goes about unrecognized I am saying we are changing that am we didn't we preach strategic alliance with the Unseen World being sensitive to the to how the angels of God are moving right now connecting with the Ang of God Amen and he says and the angel of God would went before the camp of Israel he is still here amen the angel of God that went before the camp of Israel removed and went back behind him and the pull of cloud went from behind their face and stood behind them right watch what he says is a go between in the time of trouble so who answered your prayer brother Joshua it was the go between in a time of trouble amen praise the Lord amen so when the time when trouble begins to face you sickness on every hand trouble who comes up the angel of God comes up goes out between you and the sickness ah now you know you got a force there you can tell devil you're coming to me with sickness and disease but I come to you in the name of the Lord amen amen Exodus 23 says behold I sent my angel before thee beware of him for my name is in him oh yes amen amen he says my name is in him amen I don't know about you but his name is also in a people hallelujah yes amen so now you got a double portion here you got a people who will possess his name and you got the angel of God where the Lord says my name is H him he said go between in the time of trouble right the angel of God comes up goes between you and the sickness stands there in the way challenging you to take God's word thank you Lord you see what he's doing yes he wants you to overcome right God's not going to push you through a pipe he's there to challenge you to take God's word amen you must overcome this age the angel of God has come here with a open book but does he come and do everything doesn't he say you take the book Hallelujah challenging you to take God's word God has G Israel the promise that they would go into the Land There was a million probably of a man coming to pursue them and run them down and chop them down like a bunch of animals but the angel of the Lord who was there little boy you heard about the angel of the Lord you know about angels angels are real amen you know angels are real you ever seen an angel amen if you pray and ask the Lord you can see an angel amen amen one time there was a little boy forgive me amen I'm teaching Sunday school here one time there was a a younger boy and they were surrounded by armies physical armies they could see them these men were standing with horses chariots swords and he was standing with a prophet of God his name was Elisha and he was trouble because what would you do if you saw yourself surrounded people with guns and knives and coming for you you'd be scared so he asked the man of God what are we going to do and the man of God says open the boy's eyes amen and when he opened his eyes he saw Supernatural chariots horses Angels amen yes Lord hallelujah there to fight so God is there to fight for you in your battle yes no matter what you're going through God is there to fight for you yes amen hallelujah you just trust the Lord you believe the Lord amen in your worst situation whatever you're going through in school or whatever you're going through in life just trust the Lord and say Lord I'm trusting in you right now amen I may not see you but I believe you are here with me amen you promis to do that he said he'll never leave you nor forsake you amen amen praise the Lord thank you Lord so he says but the angel of the Lord who was there to carry them to the promised land rose up from the camp and when and stood between them and the the danger ah I like this then I'm not alone amen amen praise the Lord now you know why you know the Bible says that he could have called 10,000 angels amen the Angels must have been ready to go when they wanted to kill Jesus all the Angelic host was ready to amen take on the the demon powers and their forces just one word the prophet of God says the Angels would have come and slayed every one of them and he will fight for you people he says thereare anyone touch you he says it's better a millstone be hang around their neck and they be cast into the sea god values his people amen yes that's right thank you Lord hallelujah now you may be thinking he's talking about the children of Israel but watch the prophet trying to bring it to present tense he still does it paragraph 134 he will make the way how many of you are trusting the Lord for a way amen he will make the way in fact he's already made the way and we are clearing the the corridors right now amen he says oh I just love him for that don't you now watch if you watching a prophet he's preaching but he's got time to tell the Lord how much he loves him oh this is worship this goes beyond preaching this is showing your reality how to approach your situations in the midst of your trial can you say oh Lord how I love you I thank you Lord Jesus you give you take away you give and you take away but my heart will choose to say yes Blessed Be Your Name be like job Hallelujah he says he's saying he'll make a way for he says oh I love him for that don't you he'll make a way for every sick person sitting here right now yes he has already made the way and he's standing between you and the trouble oh thank you God he's standing between you and the trouble he's standing between you and your son's healing he's standing between you and your daughter's healing not only healing I just showed you Mark 16 amen he's standing between you and your son's salvation your daughter's salvation your father's salvation your mother's salvation but he wants you to take the word and apply it thank you Jesus thank you and he's standing between you and your job promotion next he says that same angel of God is in the building right now how many if you believe that yes yes to do exactly what Jesus did in that day he's here to confirm just what he did then he's here now Family you came here for a reason I tell you if you can trust the Lord right now before you leave this place your need shall be met Hallelujah yes your prayer answered amen amen you young men you are young men amen you can dedicate your life to the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God can raise you up in his kingdom God can use you in his kingdom what am I trying to tell you amen God is concerned about you God is concerned about every detail of our lives but are we concerned but you know what the good point is every one of us have come into the house of the Lord this morning showing that you have a concern Lord amen and God is saying if you can obey my voice right now am I'm going to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ask or think oh yes Hallelujah am oh I love this the angel of God is in the building now to do exactly what Jesus did in that day you mean he can open the blind eyes now I believe it right now the Lord can open our blind eyes cataracts are disappearing if you can believe it amen Jeff ears are opened yes limbs will be restored amen yes oh no brother why don't you wait for the third pool don't get me started on the third pool some people don't have a clue what the third pool is anyone wants me to break it down for them very quickly cuz the third pool is not a mysterious thing for Sons it shouldn't be mysterious for daughters of god let's see if I can do it in 2 minutes ah 2 minutes deep mysterious people take services for this how many if you want me to do it in two minutes so let's go to the root of the truth brother brandham is given uh the angel of God meets brother Bram and he tells him you'll be given three uh uh the first and second pool sign in your hand discernment of spirits right then you know he messed up that two pools and he said you explain the gift too much right now the important thing you understand here is is that pull is a fishing [Music] term hello if you read the root of the story pull is a fishing term so he was going to pull the first time and he caught small fish the I want you to know that the fish is you yes he was a fisherman Jesus said I'll make you fishes of men everybody understand that the fish is typing mankind for salvation he was going to make his first pool but he caught small fish right you know under the second pool he Tangled the lines he explained the gift to much caral impersonations rose up so under the second pull he did he got people that were after the gifts only they were not after the word but he says now don't fail on the third pull because at the third pool you'll get the rainbow trout amen now what need is it for me to come and make a mysterious explanation about the third pull when the rainbow TR is already sitting here you already pulled out amen yes didn't his message pull you out amen so the third pool got you amen yes now can I make the third pool more mysterious than that the third pool pull you out of your religion pull you out of your denomination pull you out of the world am people don't like simple preaching they want it deep and mysterious but the third pool you have responded to the third pool already you know the that's like the wild Revival people asking where's the third pool I'm looking for the third pool you're looking at the product of a third pool Hallelujah I've already been pulled out so let the next Theologian come and explain to you mysteriously about the third pool say brother I've already come out under the third pool it was the word that brought me out I'm sitting here now and you're trying to explain to me something that's mysterious amen let's let's not try and be intellectual in the message of the hour God he works in Simplicity hallelujah praise the Lord so I don't know if I did that in 2 minutes but now you know what the third pull is it was a message to pull you out to call you for the Rapture amen you're not happy with that explanation it's okay okay let's go on so that same Angel so what I was trying to tell you people are saying oh why don't we wait I just showed you the scriptures you can't wait God called you for this time in season you know who wants you to wait let me tell you your adversary the devil because if you awaken to your anointing in this hour oh yes he he has to leave bodies yes he has to dispossess bodies because you'll be casting out demons amen yes Satan will have to find other bodies demon powers will have to find other bodies demon powers have attached themselves illegally you know any spir any demon power attaches themselves illegally to a person they have no authority to be in a person's body yes and the person has a right to give them legal notice to leave this body but people are satisfied with demon powers possessing them you know we were out there doing an Outreach at the plaza and I I I I was telling brother Joshua said watch we were talking to the drunk man he says oh I just want to get out of this he wasn't drunk there you could see he was like kind of sobered up but he says I have a problem with drinking I have this thing I said can you repeat after me I told him you demon of alcohol I do not give you legal authority over my body he said you demon of alcohol and as soon as I said I do not give you he couldn't say any more he was like the demon power was restricting him from making a declaration to cast him out cuz demon powers attach themselves illegally to your body yes they come in the form of sickness disease now they come with fancy names diabetes eye blood pressure amen cancer heart trouble fibroids there's probably tons of names maybe I can't get to them now but they are demon powers you say demon power I not give you authority to attach yourself to my body leave in the name of Jesus Amen yes L amen I don't know if we're going to get through this quote amen but I want you to see how the angel of God is working and there to equip you with the word of God he says to do exactly what Jesus did in that day he's here to confirm just what he did then he's here now will always be the same the angel of God moving up to stand between us and the sickness standing between us and death no wonder David said he walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil he says standing there the angel of God went before the camp of Israel removed and went stood between them and the enemy and the angel of God Is Standing tonight between every individual year and the enemy I know what I'm speaking of I know while standing here now on the platform before this little group of people tonight I know that God is condescended coming down from glory and standing in this building now if you'll only dare move out to God's word see if you don't move before you watch amen amen so if you can rise up to the word now the angel of God is here Amen Let me close with this amen this was going to take a big portion of the service but I'm just amen as the Lord leads I'll just speak this amen very quickly so what am I talking about the Philadelphia Corridor when you know that Philadelphia was the age of Brotherly Love but the brandom calls it that the age of brotherly love amen how many of you can say Amen to that amen amen it was the age of Brotherly [Music] Love and he says that now think about it where is Brotherly Love placed on the pyramid under what age it was placed under the seventh age under L brotherly kindness but the sixth Church age is called brotherly love what I'm going trying to show you is that brother BR says the door was opened in the sixth Church age right under the Philadelphian Church age amen so we know that age started from 1750 to 1906 and it's called the age of Brotherly Love Philadelphia means love of Brethren now watch I'm going to go very quickly because I don't have time I probably got like 5 minutes right natural Israel has declared if you watch Benjamin Yan's speech yesterday because he knows all nations now ganging up against him right now he doesn't even know if Israel is going to stand with him because they don't know who the next leader is going to be the reason I'm telling you this it's almost time for us to leave here yes amen okay but watch the name Philadelphia comes up so they are saying if you watch his speech he had three points he says we've got to control the Philadelphia Corridor because the Philadelphia Corridor is the border between Egypt and Gaza if they don't control the Border there's three things that's going to happen now right what was last week's sermon message by the way utterly slay and destroy the enemy using your word seed amen right now their goal and their mission is to utterly slay and Destroy amas they say in times past under Camp David and different camps they had peace negotiations they were told why don't you leave this region if they ever fire a rocket you can come back he says this time we will not now watch very important now yes's Benjamin a benjamite his name is Benjamin right and and we know that Saul was a benjamite but coming soon was the King David amen amen from the tribe of Judah so this guy is probably the last prime minister in Israel called Benjamin but who's coming as King the lion of the tribe of Judah the son of David amen I'm trying to condense my thoughts so I can give it to you very quickly so he says to in order to maintain peace in this region now remember there were hostages taken now remember the message preached brother Joshua strengthening our borders why do we need to strengthen the Philadelphia border then because the hostages that were taken they're going to take them out to Egypt what is Egypt typing the prophet says Egypt types the world I'm trying to show you natural and spiritual so you got to work very quickly with me spiritually demon powers want to take Souls captive and take them back into the world but we must maintain the Philadelphia Corridor amen so that these ostriches cannot leave Gaza amen even if people are possessed even if people are bound right now we must maintain our borders the ERS of the message of the hour we must stand strong and fight for their Deliverance am yes amen amen amen we can't be selfish in our thinking we must fight for our brothers and our sisters we must fight for the Deliverance yes Lord amen amen amen what we are doing right now is fighting for your deliverance fighting amen for your freedom amen there are still people land hostage there 117 of them still praise the Lord so they want to get them so they say the only way that we can let me read to you is three things he says these are three War goals and you watch how perfectly it's typing with every sermon that has come forth he says the first goal is to destroy amma's military and governing capabilities they want to destroy amma's military and governing capabilities what was last week's message utterly slay and destroy the second was to free our hostages and I was telling you that John who possesses the book is going to call the names in the booken to free the hostages that are held in sin to free the ones that were born in sin shaped in iniquity came into this world speaking lies maybe don't know about a message of the hour but John who has the book of redemption must now prophesy again and call those names that are in the book am amen amen so the second war goal is to free the hostages the third war goal is to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel what is that strengthening our borders yes forming a strategic alliance with the Unseen World amen amen so that the enemy will never again possess a threat to us am thank you Lord I don't know if you can see spiritually Israel have already spoken these things and now naturally Israel speaks these things three War goals amen now why must we maintain the Philadelphia Corridor you may be saying amen because if you put it up there these things are on a paragraphs brother you're going to find it amen now getting back to the open Mission door of Philadelphian age it's right I think it starts of the quote there right I just want to show you this very quickly and we're going to close he says now getting back to the open Mission door of the Philadelphian age it did not have an Open Door of power it ought to have had I think there's a lack of power somewhere hey notice in the same verse he mentions this open door he says thou has little strength that's right the power of the spirit was missing in that age the word was well preached ah how many you can think think of some places where the word is well preached in the framework of our ranks but the power of the spirit is missing it is well able to make Souls wise unto salvation but the great power of God that showed forth his mighty works that made bear his arm in behalf of his o own was missing except amongst the scattered groups yet praise God it was growing and increased over what they had in the Reformation I'm going to close now amen hallelujah so this is what I want to get to in order to understand behold I set before an open door and no man can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age the overlap of the [Music] age there is an overlapping a melting or Fading Into rather than an Abrupt end and a clearcut star this age particularly flows into the next age and not only does this age overflow into the last and not only does this age overflow into the last age but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age you see why I'm saying we've got to maintain control of the Philadelphian border the Philadelphian Corridor yes because it's the age carrying on so what am I saying all our borders are be possessed justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now coming into the formed word image we must maintain these borders amen we can't go back into the world we can't be amen going backslid now amen we've got to be getting stronger in the faith we've got to be going higher you amen going to close now as I said the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has run about its course the latan age comes in quickly bringing both the tears and the wheat to harvest now what did the Lord say you'll send the Reapers into the field and he'll gather the wheat first what did he say so come on there's only two things now wheat or tears did he say we'll gather the tears first or the wheat first he said We Gather the tears first I want to tell you in the last few years what you've been witnessing people say why I left the message you didn't leave the message the reaper was here the reaping angel came to gather the tears that's right and he's plucking out the tears don't get disheartened if you see people leaving scripture has come to pass he says I will gather the tears first so big renowned names people that preach the message I'm leaving you do not leaving you are not leaving don't be mistaken The Reaping Angel is taking you out so rather go humbly gracefully don't say I'm leaving you're not leaving you rather go your leg be you're not leave you can't leave the message the angel took you out that's but we remain so which means our gathering is next hallelujah amen if we can see the sign that they have been gathered now more will leave more will be gathered but it's our time coming oh yes but let's maintain our corridors you can go and read speech and then you'll get what I'm trying to tell you he says for three reasons we've got to utterly slay and destroy the amas group I'm saying utterly slay and Destroy demon powers in this hour amen slay how by the word by the word by the word amen it's our weapon yes weapon of choice amen then to free the hostages let's call every name that's in that book Let's free the hostages come on let's free spiritual ostes held captive by terrorists demon powers yes sir and the Third never again allow this group to raise up again that's he says his three War goals and I say if natural Israel has his three War goals I say spiritual Israel already has those War goals and we are fighting and overcoming Hallelujah let's Stand Together amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord wonderful thank you Lord thank you let's maintain control of the Philadelphia coridor amen the age of Brotherly Love thank you Jesus Oh I want you to consider something because
