making impossible for us to gather in this fashion let's give him all the praise [Music] amen today it's it's such a joy for especially the ministers that have ried around because at one stage we thought that this event would not take place but when we prayed in those meetings that we've had we said Lord we want to be led by your spirit and when we decided and when we had our own thoughts which was not coming together God had his own and a month or two before the convention we thought this might not happen but God had his heart that there would be a certain vessel from Zimbabwe that would come and bless the Bride of Jesus Christ let's put the hand of praise to the Lord and our precious Pastor Moses that has come to bless the bride in Ministry and simplicity that even the young people that are here today would be able to benefit from we truly want to thank the lord we also want to take the opportunity to thank every single pastor and their congregations from deran and

say you are dying yes he just said go and the Lord make you home is brothery no I want you to see why brother BR could not declare death upon a person even if he knew that the person was going to die listen to the L that's what inspired me Pastor Adrian he says he says watch now I might tell you go after I come out of the vision I say go and the Lord bless you can you imagine he's blessing someone who is dying God Bless you that's me saying that but God is revealing that the sister of the brother is dead but brother Bram himself he just says you are healed go listen now that's me saying that go and Jesus Christ makes you home sometimes I see it turn that around the person and I know death is on them dark he knows that death is is on Hallelujah and they are going to I never tell them that not that I'm to tell them watch now because even though God could to pronounce de on that person yet their prayer would change that this is did you hear that even if God pronounces dead upon a person yet the prayer of that person can change that so if we can change what God has said we are changing what God has said what about what your demon said that's why I'm saying reverse order we are reversing
