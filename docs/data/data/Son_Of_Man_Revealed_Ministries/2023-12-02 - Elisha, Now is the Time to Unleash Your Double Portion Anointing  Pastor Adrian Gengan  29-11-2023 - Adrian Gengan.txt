we ask it in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen am amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ am amen praise the Lord good to be in the house of the Lord am amen hallelujah amen let's turn to the book of Second Kings amen second Kings chapter 2 Hallelujah reading from verse 13 Second Kings 2 and: 13 and he took up also the mantle of Elisha sorry the the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoke the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had also and when he also had SM the waters they parted either and tither and Elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah do rest on Elisha am amen yes amen and they came to meet him and they bowed themselves to the ground before him one more portion of scripture before you be seated John 14 amen verse 12 amen says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also amen and Greater Works than the shall he do because I go unto my father amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word may be seated amen amen for a little title we'll call it am Elisha now is the time to unleash your double portion anointing hallelujah amen hallelujah amen we we read here the ministry of Elisha is starting where Elijah leaves off but what a powerful way he starts his ministry he doesn't start it casually amen Elijah goes up to heaven and he starts his ministry by striking the waters with the mantle amen so he continues with the same dynamics that Elijah was operating in in amen yes amen amen the same way we just read St John 14:12 The Works that I do shall he do also our lord Jesus has gone away but he wants the church oh yes to continue the ministry amen with the same Dynamics amen hallelujah here what the prophet is saying now so I'm saying Elisha now is the time to unleash your double portion anointing here what the prophet is saying now so the how has come for the repeat of the Bible am and the fulfilling of the word God promised that he was going to send the former rain and the latter rain and he promised the former and the latter in the latter rain amen everybody following along amen there's going to come two Reigns but the two Reigns are going to come in the latter rain Amen in other words a double portion amen amen hallelujah amen if you if you kind of wish that you weren't in the program of God with what he's doing now then maybe you should have Liv back in the church ages amen justification would have been good enough amen just protesting the Catholic Church would have been good enough amen maybe you wanted to live in the days of Wesley amen going around preaching sanctification and Holiness message maybe that would have uh amen filled your cup amen maybe the early outpouring of Pentecost amen the outpouring of the gifts upon theza Street and the early Believers maybe you would have fancied that amen but I'm not pilled for such a Time amen those things don't satisfy me amen I'm here to fulfill all of God's word am amen and not only I'm here to make it manifest amen if I don't see it manifest something is wrong that's I'm built and designed to make the word manifest amen amen so he says like the Garment to Elijah Elisha when Elijah dropped it Elisha picked up and had a double portion he was a type of the church and Christ Christ was taken up and the same spirit that was upon Christ is upon the church tonight the Holy Ghost amen amen amen so if the same spirit that was on Christ was healing the blind man raising healing the crle man raising the dead man creating eyeballs if the Same Spirit was on Jesus ought to be upon the believer Amen brother bam tells us that Elijah only performed I think he says four Miracles but Elisha performed eight a double portion oh thank you Lord thank you Lord amen thank you Lord if you understand what I'm telling you for too long youve you've lingered in admiration not realizing that you have the mantle you're not realizing you have the double portion amen I tell you if you had to call brother Brandon here and you ask him would you want us to idolize you and the works that God did in your ministry he'll say not so take the bet on and go on amen amen Greater Works than the shall he do amen amen because when he came the church was weak the church was powerless the church was fearful when he started his ministry amen here was another David he had come to the denominational camp but the church was fear fearful amen they had seen pocket of Revival amen but this was the latter rain God was going to pour out his spirit amen God was going to Not only was he going to pour His spirit amen hallelujah let me tell you Luther is not prophesied in the Bible as a one man scripture neither is Wesley prophesied in the Bible as a on man scripture amen hallelujah yes that's right amen but there's one man prophesied amen in Malachi 4: 5 and 6 that his min was going to turn our hearts Luther's message can't turn my heart neither can Wesley's message turn my heart but this prophet of Malachi 4: 5 and six this prophet of Revelation 10:7 he turned my heart I can't even say that he is going to turn my heart because that is a blind seeing to a glass Darkly how long are we going to say the prophet is going to turn our hearts wake up blind lat us see and message people amen our hearts have already been turned back amen yes amen to what the faith what are we going to do with the faith unleash the faith amen amen yes amen the faith our hearts are not turned back to a faith for us to pickle it and to study Doctrine yes yes and to Rejoice around Mysteries the mystery came to take away the Amnesia and reveal who you are as a son and daughter of God Amen we are to be a powerful church we are to be a Church on the Move amen we are to be a a conduit of the holy spirit amen where the current of the Holy Spirit can flow through US yes Lord amen I'm afraid too many people have put conductors upon the holy spirit I only want a certain wattage of the Holy Spirit I don't want the full power of the holy spirit amen some people if the holy feel if they get the Holy Spirit on them they'll blow a fuse can't handle the power can't handle the anointing amen but you and I are designed to handle the power amen amen how much power give me the full power amen give me the full power of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen we don't want a partial understanding a partial realization we are here for the fullness of time amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so the same spirit that was on Christ if you go to read the Bible read it again read the gospels again see how the spirit is operating amen same potential ought to be in new amen amen hallelujah so the Bible becomes a new book denominational view looks at it in [Music] amazement but our view says I can do it because it's the same Spirit In Me amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so he says three stages that Elisha followed Elijah and Elijah was the type of Christ Elisha the type of the church I go up to gilgal First justification by faith and then he said now you stay here you stay with the lutherans but Elisha said not so amen Elisha and Elijah The Young and the old Prophet a type of Christ in the church he said as my soul lives I'll not stay here but I'm going with you yes that's why we added two more verses too Justified Justified because because we have moved past justification amen hallelujah am praise the Lord and he went up to gilgal and when he got up there he says now you stay here the Lord is calling me to go to the school of the prophets and so he said as the Lord lives and your soul never die I'm going with you amen I'll not leave you see that's the church keep your eyes on Jesus wherever he moves if he goes out of the Methodist Church go right on with him if he goes out of the Baptist Church go right on with him amen he goes out of brandom Tabernacle go right on with him I'll not leave you amen amen amen hallelujah or do we find safety in the familiar terrain amen hallelujah we need to step out into the unknown because that's where Jesus is amen amen hallelujah and Elijah turned around and said now you ter here for God is sending me to Jordan three places justification gilgal sanctification the school of the prophets and to the baptism of the Holy Ghost at Jordan where Jordan represents death notice Martin Luther John Wesley Pentecost down to the Jordan dying out time amen you mean for me to is double portion anointing I need to die to myself yes amen welcome to my crucifixion service where the old me Must Die amen and welcome to the resurrection service amen of the new me amen hallelujah now here it is I want you to get it after he crossed Jordan then he said what will you that I do for you and that's what Christ wants to know of the church tonight amen amen what can I do for you amen thank you thank you Lord he says Christ wants to know of the church tonight what can I do for you after you separated from the things of the world after you become a new creature in Christ Jesus after you're born again filled with a holy ghost crossed over Jordan all of the things of the world is dead behind you now ask what I can do for you amen I like this the prophet says do you like it am amen you know God doesn't call us to come certain part of the way and and walk and navigate to a certain portion for no reason he's got a purpose behind everything he's doing and you can see after he's called us through three stages of the journey after we Cross Jordan die down to ourselves he wants to know what can I do for you yes he said that a double portion of your spirit come upon me that preacher know what he was talking about a double portion cuz I want to witness that much more amen amen amen how if you want to join me to write another book of Acts amen amen ah tired of the quote tired of quoting that this church will write another book of Acts behind it how about we go and do it amen stop quoting it yes sir amen praise the Lord amen he said you ask thing but if you will see me when I go away it shall be am when you ask you what you ask you shall have amen now brother you talk about a preacher watching the other one he was really watching him you see if you are really caught up into that EV realm now where the windows of Heaven are open you'll hear you are one preacher and I'm another preacher you'll hear what this preacher is telling you and you'll ask amen praise the Lord he says that's what the church ought to be doing T doing tonight for a double portion of the spirit is watching Christ watching the Holy Ghost the way it moves amen yes you say sometimes I got to spell it out because maybe the squir will go over your head if you're going to be watching Christ and watching the Holy Ghost move sometimes I'm saying this in a way that you'll understand you got to watch your pastor you're going to watch your fivefold because where is the Holy Ghost speaking yes amen amen yes that's right I'm trying to make more sense to this quote amen he says watch one another he says that's what the church ought to be doing tonight for a double portion of the spirit he's watching Christ watching the Holy Ghost the way it moves yesen for those of you that may have been confused maybe in the next month we're going to go through Revision in what as transpired in the year amen hallelujah because I don't want to enter the next season the next here having to go through the same things again God doesn't build us to come back down and then rework us up amen hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord amen so what if you're thinking hey God sent the Holy Ghost and now you're talking about the angel of God the Holy Ghost is in the form of the angel of God it's not two beings that's right amen hallelujah you'll find that in the message Prophet details that time and time again the Holy Ghost is the angel of God Amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so he can't keep his eye on the world and one eye on Elijah that's what people have been doing now they got coye they got one eye on brandom and one eye on the world they're trying to keep the standard of the message but they got one eye on the world Amen he says he had to put both eyes right straight on Elijah follow him no but can I keep my eyes on brandom and snakes hey can't do that little bit of both no keep both eyes on the prophet he's the Vindicated Prophet yes amen hallelujah he's the one seven angels came to he's the one seven angels came to yes yes seven angels didn't come to or Roberts seven angels didn't come to Billy Graham amen Seven Angels Came From Heaven to William brandham amen yeah I'm showing you the proof yes that's right amen amen hallelujah Angel of the Lord I'm showing you the proof show me your proof Bly gram show me your proof or Roberts a Allan amen praise the Lord you see the trouble of it we got too many Christians professing Christians got one eye on the world and the other eye on the cross you'll fall as sure as the world let your eye be single amen let your heart be single let your thoughts be single brother that rubs in but that hurts but it's good you see even when we are believing God for something we can't be double minded hallelujah amen you got to be single-minded focused what you are asking what you are believing not today you know oh if you go and read about uh Faith that's waivers and you go and read about a double-minded man how God doesn't value your faith amen God wants faith that doesn't waver in spite of the circumstance whatever happens no matter the symptoms no matter amen everything comes in your way amen your faith is not wavering because you're looking to the Unseen yes Lord amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah yes he says before leaving he made preparation now I hope you really get this now because elij the spirit of Elijah God chose to use it five times amen amen the spirit of Elijah God chose to use it five times that's right amen and each one made a preparation for those that are following yes now watch what he's saying before leaving he made preparation that the spirit of God must remain on the earth thank you God takes his man never his spirit amen you see God took this man but he didn't take this one God took the man but the angel of the Lord is here yes amen praise the Lord God to Christ but the holy spirit's here tonight vindicating him just the same Lord Jesus he took Elijah he come upon Elisha come upon John the Baptist The Same Spirit made Elisha act like Elijah amen made John the Baptist act like Elijah and it makes the church today act like Christ amen amen amen he says let me say something too this uniting time to see churches uniting Nations uniting it's a uniting time of God and his bride I say this with reverence and respect and I pray that amen sometimes the word may come like it's cutting but I I really am preaching with reverence and respect too amen amen but I'm trying to to snip away all of the unbelief that has come into the church amen I'm trying to cut away all those weeds amen all those tears that have come in amen amen I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called amen I believe she is sealed in the kingdom of God Amen I believe the mechanics is there yes amen they're waiting for the Dynamics that will take her off the Earth yes into glory in the Rapture amen hallelujah amen I'm here to declare the Dynamics are here that which you have been waiting for is here amen this is that which the prophet Bram had prophesied about can somebody testify can somebody give God glory amen amen he says I believe it with all my heart we don't know how is he going to do it oh but we sure do know now it was a mystery maybe in the few years ago amen we also didn't know how he's going to do it yes amen Hallelujah we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into His Image amen amen suay we tried to display that image before the character of Christ and see him uniting himself with us in his word sorry is is a typo not word word how's he doing it he's uniting the body uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts oh yes as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper it must come before the wedding supper some are waiting to step out like Adam in the Millennium I'm telling you sons of God are stepping to manifestation now amen there'll be a final showdown amen hallelujah hallelujah yes Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the edstone is coming down to unite with the body I I condens the sermon now to show you how Elijah's Mantle dropped to Elisha but this is my highlight of how the Dynamics is coming to the church the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit thank you Lord no but I don't want the Holy Spirit again so demanding he don't like I must do anything Holy Spirit runs my thoughts to be holy my mind he only feeds on the word I mean look at the age we're living in everything's at my fingertips I can access everything on my phone entertainment 24-hour entertainment I live in maybe if you can consider it one of the greatest age in the terms of technology I don't have to be bored your Holy Spirit sounds a bit old fashioned your Holy Spirit calls for a prayer life your Holy Spirit calls for me to fast amen your Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God yes but you're telling me the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of that Holy [Music] Spirit yes amen where I can't do anything I'm governed by him amen thank you Lord amen this gospel is an oldfashioned gospel amen it's the same gospel that fell on the day of Pentecost amen hallelujah amen but when that head and the body unites together half power of the Holy Ghost will raise up you reading when that head and body unites together 3/4 Power full wedes day power Sunday power the full power of the Holy Ghost amen would raise up just exactly like that even the dead amen yes let me tell you if we are seeing the return of the full power coming now in this year expect the resurrection of the Dead come on now amen why what stop living in the natural in the carnal these things are going to Decay amen hallelujah everything is set for the destruction right now atomic bombs and everything is set for the destruction get your mind of the world and get your mind on Christ amen the full power of the Holy Ghost is here amen it's going to it's raising us up just exactly like that and it's going to raise the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight into the skies the Dynamics his the Holy Spirit yes Lord yes thank you thank you lordess the more we read this the more we understand why people only want the mechanics because the mechanics can make you look like you got it the revelation of the word can make you look like you got it in fact you can go around like what they've been doing for so long now 50 60 years saying we got the word we got the word look at our revelation we got this we don't baptize in titles we don't baptize in father son Holy Ghost we don't believe in three gods yes bashing everyone stoning everyone amen praise the Lord the Dynamics is the holy spirit amen amen amen oh I got the Holy Spirit how you got the Holy Spirit tell me I believe the word for my day I received the message of the hour do you pray um you read your Bible uh the holy spirit is a feeder on the word that's right amen that's correct amen amen praise the Lord now let's just look at maybe the ministry of Elisha for a bit amen then we close it's one thing to be connected to Elijah's Ministry it's another thing to be connected to Elisha's Ministry amen because Elijah is the revealer of the word Elijah is the one who turned their hearts back on Mount K when the hearts was turned to other gods he put a he put a show down there on M Carl that's right if God be God let him answer by fire amen right so he turned the hearts of the children of Israel back to the faith of their fathers amen but to be connected to the Elisha [Music] Ministry yeah we read in the Bible amen if you go you continue there in Second Kings amen praise the Lord amen amen in Second Kings you'll see here he start his ministry by striking the waters we said right then he goes and there's now there's no water in the land you'll find the king of Judah and the king of Edom come to him and there's no water for the for the captains and for the armies and there's no water for the cattle and he says alas the Lord had called these three kings together to deliver them in the hand of Moab who's Moab somebody tell me lot that's lot reproduced yes a son is his father reproduced amen you see why it's not always wise to save lot lot now wants to come against the children of Israel coming to fight with them if I can tell you between two men lot has come back to fight Abraham that's basically what it is right if you trace it back lot is coming to fight Abraham he says alas these three kings have been delivered to Moab there's no water watch Elisha's Ministry he tells him amen yeah if you read it there you know what he tells him to make the valley full of ditches that's in verse 16 3:16 he says thus say the Lord make the valley full of ditches amen amen I want you to see that this man man he's so connected to the anointing you we don't have time to read all of it but you'll know this man can see an Unseen World amen that he speaks and he says Lord open this boy's eyes that's right right there's another time 150 soldiers come to him they come three times 50 at a time 150 soldiers and he's able to call fire from heaven amen he's also able to Blind the ey eyes of the army he's able to open and close eyes he's able to open the boy's eyes to an Unseen World and he's able to Blind the Army he tells him make the valley full of ditches and then water comes and it fills all those ditches and then the animals can drink and all of them can drink if you really understand what I telling you this man was changing the econ econom ICS of the country yes that only the children of Israel would be blessed yes amen the fact that there was no water all around he's telling you the economic crisis was gone terribly bad amen amen you can switch anytime you ready amen he paid a Deb he did not owe I owe a de I could not pay I needed someone to wash my sins [Music] away and now I sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus Paid a Debt that I could never pay one more time he paid a de he did not owe I owe a DE I could not pay I needed someone to wash my away and now I sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus Paid a Deb that I [Music] could amen praise the Lord so amen just to catch where we left off there he's able to change the economic situation let me remind you of how we started who's Elisha somebody say me Elisha is typing you so no matter what situation they present to Elisha is able to speak amen and change the situation yes amen yes amen yes Hallelujah that's right Elisha now is the time to unleash your double portion anointing now is not your time to accept complaints and to sympathize with complaints amen now's not the time to add to the problem now is the time to speak amen and change the situation around you people not coming to you with problems for you to say yeah chable they coming to you amen for you to turn it around oh thank you Lord thank you Lord change our mindsets sometimes we don't understand amen maybe we need an El physical person to say when they come to you with a problem to tap you in head and say open your eyes amen this is your test amen so they came to him with a problem no water dig Valley full of ditches water they come to him and tell him our water amen he's he tells them put salt in the water there's death in the pot take a handful of meal put it in the pot yes there is no situation that they present to Elisha that he is not able to turn around thank you Lord he's able to do the Greater Works yes Lord thank you thank you Lord but you've got to believe that you are you've got to believe you are called you've got to believe you have the mantle amen you have the double portion anointing thank you Lord amen I can show you yourself in the scripture after Revelation 10:7 the mightiest Prophet on the earth comes Revelation 10 8 to1 Elisha's Ministry amen oh yes hallelujah amen Lord and Elisha's Ministry has a Ministry to set the captives free yes it has a Ministry to cancel yet yes amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah some of you don't believe me amen hallelujah you can read this chapter amen when you go home yeah in chapter 4 one of the prophet's wives the prophet dies and his wife he's left with the dead amen you'll read there in chapter 4 verse 4 I think it is maybe you can read verse one second king chapter 4 there's a there's a wife amen certain woman of the wives of the sons of the Prophet unto Elijah thy servant my husband is dead and knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor is come to take him my two sons to be born men bondage slavery I want you to know Elisha's Ministry is here to set the captiv free amen but you got to be willing to follow the words of Elisha amen hallelujah and how many if you know debt can lead to bondage like the story tells you even in our own lives death can lead to bondage amen we we we have a lifelong commitment I'm just paying off debt but Elisha was operating under a different anointing a double portion anointing he is here living in a supernatural world he can see the Angelic realm amen I tell you there's a group of people who can see the Angelic realm all around us yes amen hallelujah thank now what Elijah said to him what can I do for you he says to her did not our Elijah tell at what can I do for you such as I have give I unto thee amen amen hallelujah here in verse two and Elisha said unto her what what shall I do for thee tell me what has thou in the house and she said th handmade had nothing had not anything in the house save a pot of oil she had a little bit of Holy Ghost but Elijah can work with that amen hallelujah amen when somebody comes you with a problem change their question ask them what do you want let them tell you what they want what do you want speak to me tell me create an opportunity opportunity for them to tell you what they want yes and you operate like Elisha amen and tell them I give it to you they may not understand what you are telling them but you possess the power if you can before you go and shut and close heavens and and do all of those things how about you operate the gift in a small way you know that you prophesied to close the heavens you'll be able to slice C amen close the heavens call for rain call for fire amen yes but you're going through a training ground I'm saying look at the opportunities that are presented to you daily amen hallelujah what is it that you want that handm made and not anything save a pot of oil you see you got to have something go borrow vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessel vels borrow not a few and when thou come in shut the door and pour out into those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full amen so she went out and shut the door upon her and upon her sons and brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were full she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed you see who can stop the Holy Ghost is you say I'm full amen that's just one type there we can shut out the Holy Ghost if we say we are full as long as we keep bringing a vessel keep pouring out keep emptying out amen the Holy Ghost can keep filling keep filling keep filling then she came and told the man of God and said and and he said go and sell the oil and pay thy debt and and live thou and thy Children of the rest so what Ministry is this it's the ministry to set the captives free it's the ministry to pay off debts yes yes am I'm just giving you something right there yes amen but it's up to you whether you're going to receive it right now it's up to you whether you're going to receive it right now yes oh I love my bond were they called Bond men where they call Bor men but I'm telling you Elisha is the the power yes Lord some of you don't want it but I'm giving it anyway amen take it amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen don't care amen follow the instruction let God perform it amen hallelujah in fact you can use the scripture Lord the bond men have come every month they come to my house but listen to the key what's in your hand God's going to use your ability what's in your hand to cancel that debt thank you Lord amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah it's in your hand you see you expecting to fall from the sky what's in your hand yes God has given you the ability yes that's right God has anointed you yes God has called you for this hour yes you got to see yourself as the anointed of the Lord Lord my hands are blessed my feet are blessed my words are blessed every place the soul of my foot tread is blessed I'm blessed coming in I'm blessed going out amen I have no need of lack amen hallelujah yes your current situation that you are living in is because of the words you have been speaking amen hallelujah tell them I am blessed I'm highly favored of the Lord amen hallelujah because here's Elijah telling them Elisha telling me verse S pay your debt and live thou with the rest you'll have Surplus amen right thank you Lord amen hallelujah go back to verse one there I want somebody to go this and and look this there you see the bond men some of you don't know the bond men some of them are called Absa Standard Bank FNB who are the crooks there's one more I'm not mentioning they's sayand there's another isn't there big four Cooks net bang amen the four hen but they are Bond men you say no bro I don't worry about me I've planned 30 years you want 30 years I'll take my time when I'm it'll be free I can enjoy the house but then the children are gone you know free no amen you need to sell up by that time and down scale you work so hard to build a a big house for all the kids now when you finally paid it off and you got 5 R left over now you come want to spend it but the kids are gone amen don't fall prey to the cycle of the system amen hallelujah within you you possess the power amen hallelujah I'm showing you Elisha's Ministry amen hallelujah if you're connected to Elisha I'm going to say it again you can pay off your debt yes you can set the captive free amen if you're connected to Elisha you will neither be Barren or unfruitful amen because straight after that she finds a man I'm going to say this but I hope you understand what I'm saying she finds a man who has respect for the man of God the shite woman and she wants to do something for the man of God sometimes our blessings are connected by us doing something for the man of God yes some people already know this amen amen amen amen hallelujah you know that brother son is already connected with that every time he can bless a man of God he tells them come see me at my shop why he understands amen the blessing attached to it yes amen hallelujah amen some of us have been practicing that if we got the opportunity we take a minister out for lunch or we do something to try and bless him she had respect to the man of God and wanted to do something for the man of God Amen so blessings something are connected by doing something for the man of God so what she did she built a room for him yes amen and she fed him you read in verse 8 she constrained him to eat bread and not only once the Bible says so it was as of as he passed by he turned in to eat [Music] bread not go tell everyone here I told the pastor come one time now he's coming every week amen and she said unto her husband behold I perceive we need some moment of perception I'm talking about the bride of Christ not just woman I'm talking about the body we need some woman who can recognize that somebody carries an anointing she says behold I perceive that this is an holy man of God which passed us continually let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a Bed table stool and a Candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us he shall turn into the you see she had to desire something to do for him amen why let's go to Matthew 25:40 while we here I'll I'll show you why because some of us don't have a physical Lord Jesus to do something for but yeah what our lord Jesus is telling us Matthew 25:40 and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as you have done it unto the least of my these my brethren you have done it unto me you see who you're doing it for you're doing it for the Lord Jesus Christ amen now notice something the shunamite woman did not go to the prophet and say I'm Barren I'm unfruitful give me give me a child she didn't do it who are we dealing with still Elisha it fell on a day amen so he calls okay let's read verse 12 gazi servant called the shite woman she stood before him verse 13 say unto her now behold thou has been careful care ful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee amen wouldest thou be spoken for the king or the captain of the host Oh you mean Elisha has power to control the Army sir you mean Elisha has influence with the King he is asking the woman can I speak to the King on your behalf can I speak to the captain of The Host yes amen you see elishah has power and influence over the king and the Army and he's offering protection of the army but he's also offering favor of the king basically he's asking her if you really want I can set you up in the natural economy and she answered I dwell among my own people what then is to be done for her how many times have we we read now Elisha's Ministry is to what can I do for you amen such as I have give I unto thee amen what can I do for you amen it's a Ministry of servitude it's a Ministry of impartation it's not a Ministry to take to take to take to take it's a Ministry to give freely you have received freely you give out come on elishah now is the time to unleash your double portion anointing amen amen thank you Lord remember it's not up to you to fulfill it it's up to God to fulfill it he's the one telling them take the valley full of ditches God has to come and fill this Valley full of ditches he's the one telling this woman amen go and find vessels and when you pour the oil it won't seize God has to come and back it up he's the one that's telling this woman now amen telling her this woman here in verse 14 she had no child and her husband is old he says call her and when he had called called as she stood in at the door and he says about this season according to the time of life thou shall Embrace a son and that sounds so familiar so Elisha has a Ministry to make the barren woman conceive you see some of you got friends here family members they can't have children but your mouth is zipped but I'm showing you you are Elisha amen amen call them some of you really want me to get down into this because you you think flow over my head I'm pulling it back now amen stop sympathizing stop speaking in your bedroom and saying shame I feel so sorry for them they can't have children Ah that's right God presented to you you to them them to you we just Rejoice how we are Elisha yes Elisha hallelujah thank you Jes thank you Lord thank you Lord about the season you see what he's connected with the angel of the Lord that's what I'm trying to tell you I said where these words sound so familiar because the angel of the Lord uses the exact words didn't he tell that to AA you shall have a son and his name Shall be Called ishmail didn't he tell that to Sarah you shall have a son and his name Shall be Called Isaac didn't he tell Mary you shall have a son and his name Shall be Called Jesus amen Elisha is the one who possesses Godlike power Godlike character amen Elisha is the one amen hallelujah he's the one that Adam like like like what Adam was supposed to manifest but now the angel of the Lord would show them how to operate the power because Elisha let me tell you if you didn't know I told you in a veiled way that he could see the supernatural World Elisha is connected to the angel of the Lord am if you are seeing Elisha operate in the double portion anointing it's not on his own strength Elisha is connected to the angel of the Lord come on now Mark 11:23 the 11 th000 Gentile workers connected with the angel of the Lord that's how they are doing the Greater Works that's right about the season according to the time of life thou shallal Embrace a son what did he ask you before this what do you want now he's being so specific not you going to have a baby you are going to have a son am thank you you're going to have a son and she said n my Lord thou man of God do not lie unto thine handmate you see and the woman conceived and bear his son at that season that Elisha had said unto her according to the time of life amen praise the Lord amen now we know in the progression of the story amen we don't have too much time to go into this amen hallelujah we find that the boy dies when does he die at Harvest Time amen you'll find there that the Harvesters are in the field the boy dies at Harvest Time and then let's go to draw verse 26 verse 26 this is the famous one year now where gazi is asking the shite woman run now I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it is well amen you see this is the type of person I was telling you don't focus on the problem don't speak the problem yes yes she said it is well when she came to the man of God okay you know the story she said don't deceive me I told you not to deceive me right and then Elisha tells him take the stuff and go place it on the boy's head now the mother of the child in verse 30 says this and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee wasn't this the words Elisha was speaking to Elijah so anyone connected with the ministry of Elisha will speak the same language because of your impartation because of your influence yes amen and he arose and followed her now what kind of Faith was this woman portraying she was possessing the faith of a lion amen a ferocious Faith amen Fai would [Music] teeth what what do you call his dogs that when they lock in you they get lock jaw he Rod viols eh R VI for the submiss he saying another door same dog Rod viers they lock and they don't leave oh yes how many of you have R VI of Fate here amen when your faith locks amen amen what happens when your faith locks you still continue to believe the Unseen and that's called violent Faith amen how many of you seen these doors when they lock they're singing Lis are they ferocious have you seen these dogs even you get scared the dog not biting you but you watching the dog biting someone you even scared am I right what is it violent Faith amen faith that locks in that's the type of Faith this woman was portraying I will not leave thee Rod viol is amen I believe they have an habit of going for the neck amen and once they snap it locks the jaws and even if you beat the dog or do anything it will not open up its jaw until it is finished come on now lock in with your faith amen and don't remove your faith don't waver with your faith until it is finished amen we need some violent faith we need some ferocious faith we need the faith of a lion amen fake people amen hallelujah with violence Faith um let me tell you about violent Faith let me tell you about people who have violent faith when they speak the words with their mouth and they believe with their heart they don't change their word yes 10,000 may come and tell you another thing they don't change their word yes amen once you get a grip of it by faith no matter what happens I'm not going to change my word and my faith is locked in Christ you hold to it no matter what hold to it and you keep amen supplying the substance faith is a substance you keep supplying the substance amen amen because the substance will go and get the job done thank you that's why Jesus said it is the violence that take the kingdom of God by force you shall have whatsoever you say amen hallelujah praise the Lord and then you know basically what I'm telling you Elisha has a Ministry to call back the dead amen amen amen Elisha has a Ministry to operate Mark 16 Elisha has a Ministry to operate Mark 11:23 Elisha has a Ministry to operate Mark 9:23 amen nothing shall be impossible to you amen yes Elisha now is the time to unleash
