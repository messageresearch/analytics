I'll be worship and praise you this morning thank you Father for thy loving kindness your mercy and Grace thank you for your goodness and your love Lord we thank you Lord this morning that we can be found in your divine presence of God because there is no better place this morning now there's nothing else that can satisfy our souls there's nothing that can quench you with us there's nothing that can satisfy our hunger Lord this morning but it is the word of the Living God the beginning was the word the word the same word was made flesh two thousand years ago and father through this message of this hour the same word has come now Lord and make is materializing Lord in a many-membered body and we are so grateful father we can be counted in that number this morning Father we could be part of that bright this morning uh we are so grateful and thankful we can be part of this invisible Union that is taking place in this hour we pray God that you raise our freighter yes and Lord through the preaching of Thy word that the Amnesia be removed and each one will come materialization father who we are this morning Lord are the way we come from and Lord where we are going from this place we thank you Father for this wonderful messenger we thank you for a prophet that you have sent us we thank you Lord for the open door Lord that the bride can step into another dimension the bride can go come into the bright angel she can walk in the bright light great God that you come in a very special way and bless us this morning as we come around Thy word because heaven and earth will pass away Lord we cannot count on heaven we cannot count on Earth we cannot depend on heaven we cannot depend on Earth but what we can depend on is your word this morning because the world will never pass away this morning we pray that you'll come in a sweet way Lord from the pulpit to the pure as we surrender our minds to the Lord we surrender our bodies to you this morning and we say like Mary said be that to us according to Thy word this morning a blessing anointed servant to Lord Pastor Adrian this morning together with the Believers Lord God father we are happy that we could be in fellowship with them this morning we pray that you will take them from strength to strength and from one glory and to another glory in the name of Jesus Christ as you as you wait upon the when you anoint the inspiration and bless the reading up Thy word as you wait on thee now in Jesus name we asked him much Thanksgiving amen amen greetings you brothers and sisters and a wonderful name of our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ while we're standing together Colossians chapter one we're going to read from verse 12. Colossians 1 from verse 12. it says giving thanks unto the Father which had made us me to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence we're going to turn to John 1 1. um very familiar scripture also John 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God you may take your seats this morning for a title we're going to title the sermon provision in the word amen and so we are happy that we could I mean fellowship with you this morning and I'm thankful to you Pastor Adrian for the invitation to minister and uh it's a good friend of mine also and we appreciate the friendship and love and appreciate you all very much so we are glad that we could be here yeah with my family also this morning normally they don't like to travel with me but they for some reason they wanted to come today I don't know why but they wanted to come so they are here this morning and so um I trust the things that we'll share will just be a blessing amen and uh at the Holy Ghost can take control we can put down our notes and we can have our thoughts about what we think uh could be a blessing but unless he comes and does something and so that's what we have expectation is this morning he said the Lord will come down and come in uh Minister and remember there was a pastor that told me one time he had his son preach for the first time and after you started Bridge he said Dad how did they do he said look you had Nice Notes you had nice points but there was no anointing okay so next time pray for the anointing when you're preaching and so I always pray for that Lord I said Lord when we have our notes prepared and uh please send an anointing also at the word that's being preached will come in anointing the people will be anointed to receive the word as well so I trust this morning it'll be the same that it'll be an anointing that comes with the preaching and from the from the congregation together we'll pull on the word we'll pull on each other and we'll have a blessed time this morning it's important to raise uh raise up out of this Earthly place of Leo this year and it's a it's a tug of war that we are in Daily we're fighting this battle we are we're living in two dimensions in this laodicean uh Dimension and also in the bride the bright age the bright Dimension like brother Venom says and so we have to live in the Supernatural and we're going to be living in Two Worlds at the same time but the bride you must remember is called up higher and we are called up into an Open Door age and the problem says that open door the door is Christ the open door is revealed Christ in this day so it's a revealed Christ that we would gather around the Bride of Jesus Christ and like the scripture says where the carcass is the eagles they gather themselves together and so we gather to hear the word brothers and sisters we always gather to hear the word the word which is the logos the word which prevents says the logos is the anointing or the anointed ones that's where we gather and so the word is preached um there's anointing of the logos and there's always a power that goes forth when the word is preached and the Believers have to believe that when you come to the fellowship and the word is being preached you have to believe that there's a power that goes forth when the word is preached it's not it's not about who is standing behind the pulpit and preaching it's about the word all the time when the word Goes Forth there's a power that goes with the word and so like the prophet says he speaks about creation he says the word of God went forth he said the word of God went forth and he said let there be light he said and then the light followed he said why because his word has a creative power all the time now he's the word is not a limited brothers and sisters and you have to remember that the word is the same yesterday today and forever the word the the nature and the character the attributes of the word won't change so if the word that when fought in the beginning said let there be light and there was a creative power in the world and light followed when the world is preached again now it will have the same creative power it has to follow that word button sisters because it's not unless it's the word of a man if it's the word of a man then it will fail hopelessly but if it's the same word of the Lord then when it goes part it will do the same things it'll have a greater power and what it says will follow when it is shed so uh that's the way God does it and uh he sends his word uh prabham says he sends his word for this hour and the Holy Spirit comes and he makes that word live the prophet speaks about the creative power he calls the creative power the power of faith means that every single one of us can have the creative power it's called The Power of Faith he says when two omnipotents come together he says to Omni faiths come together he says something he's got to shake whatever you say with that creative power of the omnipotent God Prophet says it creates a power and it goes forth Yonder and it brings it to pass what you say two omnipotence I want to read a culture work works is the faith Express 65 11 26 paragraph 151 just to lay lay a few things and as we get into what we're going to say when that word went forth now it becomes a seed amen it has to fall somewhere the word has to fall somewhere and if God said it there's bound to be a womb somewhere for it to fall into just as he said all things are possible to them that believe if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you said you see there's got to be somewhere that's right unquote so the word is a seed and there must be a womb somewhere here this morning somewhere here this morning that will receive the word when it is preached and when it is received in the right whom it will materialize to that individual you understand Francis when the world is God goes forward there has to be a room to receive that word because the word is a seed that's going to fall on a home and when it's received in their right womb with the right kind of Faith it's got to materialize to that individual says when the angel came to Mary the prophet says she was thinking about the scripture in Isaiah says that a mind was on that word mind was on that scripture and uh the prophet drama times dramatizes it it says Mary and Joseph had been to the synagogue that morning and the priest was speaking about the book of Isaiah a virgin shall conceive and so when she when they come home they've been talking about that scripture of Isaiah 7 14 a virgin shall conceive and a mind was on that scripture yes beholding virgin shall conceive therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive Isaiah 7 14. amen and so she heard the word being preached and she was pondering on that word means that after the word was preached in the synagogue she went home and she stayed under the anointing of the word amen amen now I hope you I hope you can catch that this morning means that when you leave the door this morning you don't leave the word back in the church but the word must go with you and you must stay in the anointing of the word and your mind must be pondering on that word why because you want that word to materialize you want that word to manifest in your own life and so Mary when she left the synagogue she went with the word the word that the pre the priesthood preached she went with that word at home she's pondering about that word and then the angel came to Mary and spoke and the prophet says that mary caught the germ of the word a virgin shall conceived in her womb when the Angels spoke it she caught it and she held on to it and then she said be that unto me according to Thy word so she caught the germ of that word that scripture a virgin shall conceive and then it materialize in her body the word spoken by the angel started to create in the womb of Mary a body again you see the word and its creative power do we have Mary's here this morning that when the word is preached they're able to catch the germ of the word and say be that to me according to the word that is being preached that jam is life this morning he stayed under the anointing of the word when it was preached in that day like there was two women one time brother Branham speaks about the two women that come in the prayer line and they had been prayed for in the service he says one had a stomach problem and she could not eat anything she eats she would take out she was very sick and the other had a cancer in the face and the prophet says the boat had been prayed for and says the angel of the Lord announced their healing amen and um he said uh and and the prophet says now go home and receive your healing now you might you might look for a supernatural Angel this morning it'll be good if you see it but the prophet says the angel of the Lord is in this message I mean the very word that we preach is the Angel of the Lord the very word that we preach is God himself as the prophet says the angel of the Lord is in this message the angel of the Lord that's going to visit you is going to come to the word the preaching of the word the preaching of the Prophet sermons is the Angel of the Lord coming to you amen the Robin says the angel of the Lord is in this message and the message is the word of God which is God himself and so the angel of the Lord when the word goes sport the angel of the Lord he brings that word to us and he will also bring that word to pass because the word of the Lord will not return void and so Prophet says yeah these two women had went home after the angel of the Lord had pronounced their healing and he said it was six weeks that had gone by think of that because we want the miracle right now if we prayed for today it must happen now if it doesn't happen now or what it was not spiritual enough but maybe we are not spiritually now to wait upon the God's word because the prophet says yes six weeks had gone by and there was nothing and so after six weeks there was no healing and the lady with the stomach trouble she tried to eat every day the prophet said but with no joy but remember when the word goes forward it will not return void but accomplish what its purpose for the prophet says six weeks later one morning she felt something cool come over her and instantly the woman got healed and the problem that she ran to a neighbor that was in a prayer line with her the one with the cancer on the face and when she got to a house she heard her screaming and shouting and praising God and when she went inside she saw this woman dusting the bed trying to find that piece of cancer that fell off and the problem says the word had went forth in the meeting and the angel of the Lord stuck around the neighborhood all that time and after six weeks of sticking around in the neighborhood the angel of the Lord visited their home why because the word of the Lord it went forth it will not return void but it accomplished that which is purpose for the healing was pronounced and so the angel of the Lord was waiting in the area waiting in the neighbor to bring that word to pass you hold on to that gem if it doesn't happen day one day two week one week two but you still hold on to that jam because the angel of the Lord that gave that word over the pulpon will see to it that it is met so we are saying that when the word is preached the angel of the Lord in this message that's bringing this word will bring it to pass in our lives you gotta catch the gem of the word for in your spiritual home and you must hold on to it brothers and sisters because it has the power to create and the prophet says the power to create is called faith when you leave yeah you've got to stay in the Supernatural you got to stay in the Supernatural for it to come to pass you can't leave you and leave your blessing back in the house of the Lord you've got to go out go out and confess your healing go out there and confess your deliverance go out here and ponder about the word that have been preached unto the angel visits your neighborhood comes into your home and brings that word to pass in your life don't let go once you catch the gym but the man speaks about Daniel one time he said Daniel was praying for 21 days he says in the for 21 days his prayer never went to God he says because the kingdom the prince of the kingdom of Persia was opposing his prayer the angel could not get to Daniel when the angel came to Daniel he said for 21 days I could not come to you but 21 days your prayer could not be answered because the Prince of Persia was opposing your prayer so what is the prophet saying that you've got to hold on to that faith you've got to wait if it's being opposed but the angel will break through for you once you Captain catch the jump but the man says once you catch a drum go out praising the Lord never have a negative testimony you love the Lord so this morning we're going to be touching on a few things and I trust that it will give us Grace um this morning I've been speaking on uh the Redemptive names of Jehovah on our Tuesday night services and I thought that this morning we would touch on Jehovah Jireh and what you the name Jehovah Jehovah means to exist ought to become known means to exist means he's the one that exists he's the ma is the one that always exists he is the I am he is the self-existing one he is Elohim Jehovah is Elohim the one that exists or the one that self-existed Jehovah means to become known means that he wants to make himself known this self-existing one Elohim the South existing one Jehovah that exists and in him is all the goodness in him his life he wants to make himself known or wants to reveal himself so in other words this great Jehovah who exists and wants to make himself known he has all of these Redemptive blessings in him all of this Redemptive nature and characters in him all of the Redemptive names in him and so he wants to make himself known he wants to make himself known as Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha and Jehovah Nissi so he wants to make himself known so Jehovah is the one that wants to make himself known amen but the prophet says that when he existed alone as Elohim he was too mysterious to be understood means that he could not reveal himself as Elohim Christ The Mystery of God revealed 6307-28 paragraph 21 141 brother Adam says the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people 142 he says he couldn't do it as a as great Jehovah God who covered all space-time and Eternity Jehovah is the one that wants to reveal himself we said but he could not do it in that form so he could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin then after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and on out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was that was all that and still is unquote is telling us that Jehovah God Elohim he is too mysterious to ever be understood or in that form that he existed he could not reveal himself he could not make himself known yet Jehovah means the one that wants to make himself known so he will make himself known we know and he will Express different attributes Express the different Redemptive names Jehovah Jireh uh Jehovah I find the different names but this morning we're going to speak on Jehovah Jireh and Jireh means he that sees oh Jara means cease to it all it means makes a provision in other words uh jarrah means the one that sees he sees to it and he makes a provision for it Jehovah existed alone and he wanted to make himself known as jira the one that sees and how does he see him says he sees by foreknowledge nothing happens without him knowing about it first Jehovah knows the beginning until the end he saw the fall of Man and he is jaira the Bible says that our hair in our head is numbered he says we cannot lose one strand of hair without him knowing Sparrow can't fall to the ground without him knowing the back cannot bear its eye without him knowing Jehovah Jireh the one Jireh is the one that sees by poor knowledge he knows all things and because he sees the other interpretation is that he sees to it also he's not Gyra the one that sees and then leaves it and that hope something happens when he sees it but no he sees it and he sees to it he makes a probation for it so in other words Jehovah that existed before the foundations of the world before man was even created he saw the future and he saw man would fall and when he saw man would fall he said I'm gonna make a provision for man before he falls you understand that button sisters he doesn't wait for the problem to find the solution he has a solution before the problem he doesn't wait for you to have a need before he provides for your need he already has a provision said before you raise your hand God already knew your problem but he just waited for you to action your faith and say I lift my hand I surrender to him he already knows how it needs he already knows when he's in need and he has already made a provision so he knew man was going to fall and goal of creation will fall before the foundation of the world the Lamb of God was slain eating that God in other words he saw the fall of Man and before Man was created he provided for man the Lamb of God was slain in his thoughts that's Jehovah Jireh that's how Jehovah Jireh Works he knows what it is going to be and he makes a provision before God had seen it and uh then he makes a provision for hit God makes a provision for the fall of Man before man was even created in the thoughts of God the Lamb of God was slain God himself saw himself becoming flesh so himself becoming the lamb to become the atonement for sin to reconcile man back to himself but look what God saw himself do become flesh was going to take a long time said the creation of the Earth in the beginning God God created the Heaven and the Earth full stop granted it took millions of years just to create heavens and earth he said but every other creation the First first day second day was a thousand year at a time but it says before that the Heaven and Earth creation full stop was millions of years so God saw himself become the lamb God saw himself become flesh he took millions of years before he became flesh but the provision was already made so he had a provision and um the prophet says yeah that God's all or he says it but not not as a uh verbatim he says God's first provision was himself becoming the logos God's first provision was Christ and Birmingham says God's first decision is perfect means that when God thought he was going to fix the problem he says I am going to give the solution and the solution is going to be me myself becoming a logos the word Jehovah's provision was Christ like we ran in Colossians all things were made made by him that's Christ for him for his good pleasure and before him was nothing made he knees before all things now we're not talking about the physical body of Jesus Christ that walked on the earth two thousand years ago but we are talking about Christ according to all the prophet teaches us what Christ says all things consist by Christ all things were made for Christ by Christ for his good pleasure and the problem says Christ is the logos Christ is the word himself which is God himself the one that changes form in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God in other words you can say in the beginning was Christ the Christ Christ was with God and Christ was God in the beginning was light light was with God and light was God in the beginning was the anointing the anointing was with God and the anointing was God in the beginning was the anointed one and the anointed one was with God the anointed one was God Amen in other words when Jehovah Elohim saw that it was going to need he was going to make a provision and his provision was going to be himself condescending into the logos the word which is Christ the Lord Jehovah's provision was Christ Jehovah's provision was the word Jehovah's provision was the logos that's his first decision it's his perfect decision and it will not fail praise the Lord the Jehovah Elohim if I can call him like that he changed his form he can't descended to become known as the logos the word Son of God or Christ inside of Jehovah was all of these attributes itself Elohim was all of the attributes all of these thoughts and he expressed all of these thoughts in the word all of these thoughts in the logos now inside of him we know we had he had the attribute of being a Healer that's why it's called Jehovah the one that wants to express himself as a Healer Jehovah Rapha and so he expressed that attribute in the word the logos now I'm going to share all these quotes and so that we can just all be on the same line of thought this morning the end time sign seed it starts up with so I never touched the child he's talking about a child that was six uh six 620319 Prophet says so I never touched the child at all I went right to the pulpit with the word and stayed right with the word and the word healed us so instantly until she got up and walked away he's all right now living like anybody else so means he's saying she's all right now living like anybody else can't find it say something anywhere never even touched what he wants to say never he or never even touched her so brother is saying I never even touched her I never even prayed for her but the word went far and he says you see the word went forth she believed the word and the word is God's life and God's power and the word is what does it the word heals the sick unquote so we find our judge that all the attributes of healing was all poured out into the word the logos so in other words Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Sharma the one that wants a year all those attributes is in the word his perfect provision was the word itself his public provision was the logos itself his public provision was the anointing or the anointed one or the Son of God himself before he become flesh means his perfect provision was himself changing his form Hallelujah so he could make himself known make his attributes known so in Elohim had the attributes of being a he Prophet says the word Is A Healer the word heals instead of healing was the attribute to be a savior Jehovah said can you and he expressed all of that attribute in the word in the quote God keeps his word 570306 the very short quote he says men are not saved by emotions and all the little sad stories you tell man saved by the word of God that suddenly fixed me up end of quote means man is not saved by emotions not saved by little sad stories but man is saved by the word of God it's the word that was made flesh it's the word that become the atonement the body was just gonna be the sacrifice on the cross but Saving Grace was through the word you love the Lord you know even the slain slain lamb in the Old Testament could not do anything because they needed the blood from that lamb because the blood was their life the slain goat could not do anything because they needed the blood from the goat to go into the most holy place the slain body of Jesus Christ cannot do anything unless the life comes out of that body and comes onto a believer the light is the word himself it's the word that heals it's the word that saves you you know we normally say I I we are healed I'm saved because Jesus was hooted for my transgression bruised my iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes I'm Healed well you have to know what we are talking about who is this Jesus Jesus is the word made flesh the book The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ 65 11 25 paragraph 274. you bear with me I'm just laying down something he says pure unadulterated he says oh Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed By the Waters of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding program says the life of God in the word and the Word was bled for you that you might be washed from the foot of these prostitutes and be cleansed and certified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on his word so we have to get our thinking right brothers and sisters because we are stuck in the old traditional denominational teaching about who God is and we go back to a man with a long beard and a long hair and a white garment but that man is the word made flesh that man is the logos himself condescended created by creative power a body to come and become a sacrifice that's right by the battle yeah he said after the opening of the seals he says the Bible becomes a new book after the opening of the Season says the word bled for you the word died for you you are Washed by the bleeding word all of God's attribute was expressed in the word elohim's provision was in the word the logos a perfect provision unquote they see Jehovah's provision was the logos or Jehovah's provision is the word all the time and the word is he himself means that he changing his mom he Jehovah becomes our provision in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and then that word became flesh God's provision for man is the word himself the one that changes form that we come from invisible to something visible God's provision before the foundation of the world was the word of the logos God's provision is the word and the logos today still because if it changes it means god changed and God cannot change God cannot change and still be God 's provision is himself but he changed his Spawn from Elohim to become the logos or the word and in the logos the word is all our provision every need that we have is met by the word Hebrew study in verse 8 say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in the book calling Jesus on the scene 630804 paragraph 90 Ram says he said this is him in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word is the same yesterday today and forever it's still just take this it's the it's the remedy it's the medicine it's the cure for every breakdown it's the cure for every Cancer it's a cure for every ailment it's God manifested in a word the word is God amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is not in reference to a physical man a body that was created but it's the word that is the same the word that does not change the word that is eternal the word that is God himself which is Jehovah's provision it's what makes him Gyra is the word the word manifested makes him gyro this morning and brother bear says it's the remedy it's the medicine it's the cure for every breakdown it's a key of every Cancer it's a cure for every ailment it's God manifested in a word the word is God so the word of the logos himself is the same all the time he Remains the Same he cannot change he cannot change his mind he is the constant he acts the same way he always done he behavedness in One Way Before He'll behave the same way now but the Bible says when God made man in Eden what did he give man to fortify himself gave him the word nothing else but the word the prophet says the word is the same he says but the veil keeps changing when he is a cried out to God for deliverance God come down to Moses the word came to Moses but he veiled in a bush when they were in the wilderness the prophet says they needed a deliverer when he went in the wilderness the word veiled in a plural of cloud amen he said the same word change its Veil and he was veiling they put up fire at night and when Moses built a tabernacle he says the word came down and veiled behind magic skin the prophet says in Mighty God unveil unveiling God it says the word Veil behind the skin of Moses he says the same word veiled behind Solomon 2000 years ago the veil had changed the veil the word become veiled in a flesh of a man called Jesus Christ but the word is the same but the veil kept changing so Jehovah means to become known to reveal himself and he chose to reveal himself in the logos or in the word Jara to make provision his provision is the word his provision is the logos and it's a perfect decision brothers and sisters every need of man is met in the logos every need of man is met in the word by the word because it's God himself when God asks Abraham he said take your son up to Mount Moriah to offer him as a sacrifice Isaac said father we have the word and we have the fire but where is the sacrifice and Abraham answered and said God will provide himself the lamb now you know when you read that uh that that portion of scripture there was real omnipotent faith that Abraham had because when Abraham spoke this word it had creative power and God heard the word of Abraham and God answered Abraham yeah notice God never spoke to Abraham about any lamb or any Ram he just said take your son Isaac up to Mount Moriah and offer him a sacrifice to God never said anything about a lamb or a ram but Abraham caught the mind of God Abraham caught the word of God and God honored it because it was his word you you understand it brother and sister why God honored the words of Abraham because that was God's word God Abraham said God will provide himself a lamb or should we say like this yeah God will provide himself as a ram means that every need as we said is met in him every need is met in the word the prophet says this Bible is the is is God in print form it's called the word of God but it's actually God in print form there's many occults like that that you find in God in pin form is his Bible he says this Bible that we that we have is God in print form means whenever God expressed in the logos he put it here in print form on these pages now these words Bible is called The Holy Bible and remember there's only one that is Holy and that's God himself so how can this book become a holy book unless it's the holy God in print form and Superman says the Bible is God in print form he says it's the thoughts of God laying in the Bible in seed form you understand that he says the very thoughts of God are laying in the Bible in seed form he says that when a Believer reads the Bible and catches the thought that God had put in print form he says then it will materialize in that believer's life now we want to turn to Genesis chapter 22. Genesis 22 from verse 7 . just touch on this story of Abraham and Isaac a little bit this is an Isaac spake unto Abraham's father and said my father and he said yeah yeah am I my son and he said behold the fire behold the wood but where is a lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering means God will provide himself as that lamb for a burnt offering because he is the provision the word himself became flesh Jesus Christ was not another person that was going to come and die but God was going to provide himself a lamb two thousand years ago let me give you a quote before can you show us the father 630606 paragraph 186 and Prophet says and God's law has penalty that in the day you eat thereof that day you die and when men eat thereof he said there's not he said 187 he says God could not send another person to take their place it would be unjust again for to for me to make this brother die for what this other brother done it would be wrong you see God had to come himself and the only way he could do it would be it would be it would come in his own flesh which was his own Creative Body that he made himself that he could suffer dead amen amen so my mom is saying God will be unjust if God put it on another man so God's provision had to be himself Burger 188 he said there is the gospel in the power that's God manifested In the Flesh Emmanuel to take away the sins of the world and in that blood We Trust not in the Jew or the Gentile but in the blood of God which was Jesus Christ that's the reason he said I and my father are one my father dwelleth in me it was the father in him brother and says what is the prophet saying here it was the logos or the word made flesh inside of him that came to die at Calvary so the culture that we're reading is whatever he's saying it's unjust if God who is the word God who is the logos God who is the Son of God is unjust if you send somebody else to die so God provided himself the logos the word to come down and become flesh to die for the sins of the world amen and that's why I said when Abraham said God will provide himself God haunted those words because it was God's Own word Abraham said God will provide himself a lamb notice before the world could exist God provided himself the logos God provided himself the word as our provision now you're watching Abraham just catch your story a little bit God said to Abraham you know the prophet has taught us that when you read the Bible the Bible can be a storybook or the Bible can be made alive for your day as Satan word of God is not a dead book it's a living book and so when you read the Bible you must see yourself in the scripture you may see your day and your message in the scripture and so God said to Abraham he says take thy son thine only begotten son whom doubt lovest now you notice that there's a jewel inspiration here in the scripture because it's God you're in Prophecy and one of the thing is Jesus Christ the only begotten the only begotten son of the father and your God is saying to Abraham take thine son that only begotten son but we know that was not the only begotten son of Abraham because Abraham already had an ishma before Isaac can come along but yet the scripture is saying Abraham who is the father take thy son thine only begotten son whom thou lovest can you see the words that God is relating to Abraham the father has an only begotten son the scripture says Jesus Christ whom the father loved and put all things in his hand and yet God is saying to Abraham take thy son and only begotten son whom thou lovest so even God you're in Genesis he's not even talking about Isaac he's talking about himself that will become flesh and Abraham catches the word of God and he says and God will provide himself a lamb means that God is speaking in Prophecy Abraham is responding in Prophecy so yeah when we hear this conversation is speaking about God's own son God himself that becomes a provision as the lamb then Abraham said to Isaac God will provide himself a lamb means the logos himself will become human flesh to take the place of every sinner on the cross he will hang on those sticks that man golgana God's thoughts expressing in the word before the foundation of the world now it has creative power he spoke it before the foundation of the world but that word was going to create later on so that's why I'm saying brothers and sisters if it's going to take God millions of years for his spoken word to create a body for him to come and become the sacrifice what about you and I why can't we wait 21 days in six weeks and three weeks and two weeks if the word is spoken if God could wait for that word to be material to materialized so long how how much more can we wait for a month or two months or a year or six months or six weeks whatever it is but how much more we can wait this morning when the word goes forward for it to materialize that's what the prophet is teaching us it says You must you must stay under the anointing when it's revealed to you and it's you know it's finished you hold on until it's until it's finished don't look at the symptoms and be discouraged so God's thoughts was expressed in the word before the foundation of the world and his word that a creative power and it had to wait for a certain time to create a body a lamb Abraham caught the revelation of the word and he spoke it you notice here Abraham said God will provide himself a lamb a lamb is a young sheep not not an old one and Jesus Christ was the Lamb of God and he was not an old man he was 33 years old he was the Lamb of God he was young and he was the one that was to take away the sins of the world the scripture says he was led like a lamb to the slaughter Calvary two thousand years ago but you watch it the Bible says Abraham raised his hand and an angel speaks to him let's go to verse 9. there's two things Happening Here are happening here the one yeah is Mount Moriah then Abraham's having a conversation with Elohim with God himself and God is prophesying about a future event and Abraham in response he catches the mind of God and he's prophesying about a future event that future event is about a lamb and the lamb materialized 2000 years ago Jesus Christ but watch the third thing that is taking place on Mount Moriah verse 9 it says and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wooden order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood in verse 10 and Abraham stretched for his hand and took the knife to slay his son verse 11. 11 is 10 plus 1. and the angel of the Lord it's an Angel that's what the Bible says right an angel called unto him out of the out of heaven now this Angel is not yet on Earth but this Angel is in heaven in verse 11 10 plus one and the angel comes out of heaven is it Abraham Abraham Abraham said yemayi verse 12 he said lay not thine hand upon the land neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fear is God seeing that thou is not with hell thy son thine only son from me now this is an angel that comes to Abraham but now the angel is saying you are not without your only son from me in other words this Angel is God himself God coming down in a form of an angel in verse 11 10 plus one means god appearing as an angel Revelation 10 1. we're going to watch the two prophecies at Mount Moriah Isaac is on the altar but Abraham says God will provide himself a lamb and the lamb was made flesh at Calvary but this is a different scene that is taking place now an Angel is coming down on Mount Moriah and this Angel is coming down and Abraham is speaking to the Angel and the angel is revealing that I am God Almighty amen means it's a coming of Christ to Abraham you love the Lord in other words burn sisters there's two comings being revealed Right Here Mount Moriah the first one behold God will provide himself a lamb the first coming but there's another coming there's the angel coming down from heaven Revelation 10 1 he's declaring that I am God himself and now there's another message another coming notice the Revelation yeah unfolding of this angel coming down to Abraham the angel said thou did not did uh doubted not with all thine only son for me in other words these angels coming with a seven seal mystery the mystery that come to the seven Angel messenger the mystery of God will be finished and his Angel yeah he's saying to the prophet Abraham that this is me God Almighty coming down now at Mount Moriah lay not your hand on the land so God is revealing the mystery of himself through an angel to Abraham verse 13 look what Abraham does Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked Abraham's not looking on the ground Abraham's lifting up his eyes the Angel is coming down verse 11 10 1 the angel is declaring that this is God Almighty coming down Abraham lifts up his eyes and Abraham looks into the sky if I'm wrong you can tell me I'm wrong he looks and the Bible says and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns now it's very strange brothers and sisters there's two things here if a normal person just reads the Bible and wants to condemn our Bible they're going to tell us Abraham said the Lord will provide a lamb God put a ram a lamb is under 12 months old a ram is much older than 12 months so they can technically come and tell us a lamb and a ram now is two different age groups they can come and question what we are saying in the Bible then you read the Bible here it says Abraham lifted up his eyes he looked so he's looking upwards but behind him is a ram caught in the ticket of his horns means that he's looking upwards and when he looks up he sees alarm in the sky caught in the ticket by his horns notice the mighty angel provides himself as a ram this time not as a lamb a ram is a mature sheep like you and I one time we were five years old another time we are 20 years old then another time in your life you're 30 years old and so forth and so forth but you know it's the same person but just different dispensations of Our Lives one time we're like a lamb we are young one time we're like a ram we are old but it's a self-same person but the dispensation of our life is changed it's not what I'm saying here is Abraham is speaking about one dispensation in the lamb and then there's another dispensation being revealed also on Mount Moriah the two comings so you see it's the same person but being revealed in different dispensations so too is the Lamb and the ram it's a same person but being revealed in different dispensations Abraham said God will provide himself a lamb and the lamb was provided at Calvary but this time God Is providing a ram also the ram like Buddha ma'am says now it's the second crucifixion it's a different dispensation remember the problem preaching indictment message he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the word afresh the word bled for you at Calvary because the word was made flesh now the same word again in this day is bleeding again it's the same bleeding word but in that dispensation he was a lamb and this dispensation he's a ram you gotta understand what I'm saying now the problem says I indict this generation with the second crucifixion of the word of Flesh because it rejected Revelation chapter 10. Abraham now sees a ram and not a lamb a ram is a mature sheep means that is a ram looks much older when you watch him appear on Sunset Mountain Prophet says he has a white wig on Mindy speaks about maturity the promise calls him the Ancient of Days he's looking older at 33 he's got normal looking hair black or brown whatever it was but at the age of but in this age when he comes he has a white wig on means two thousand years ago he was a lamb looking young 33 years old but now when he comes on Mount son said he's got a white wig he's looking like a ram Howard says he appears on Sunset mountain with a white wing he is Judge causing the Ancient of Days means now it's a ram oh it's the Lamb with white hair different dispensation of the same person the angel he said to Abraham or the mighty Angel like we're saying comes down to Abraham and he makes a provision he makes a provision for Abraham but he also makes a provision for Isaac Isaac is the true Seed of Abraham and Isaac would have died there on that mountain but you know we also would have died like Isaac would have died would have died because the prophet says we were in a denominational death trap we were under a Pentecostal denominational teaching but then the angel has to come the angel had to come so it could deliver Isaac the angel had to come now because it had to come with a message of Grace Grace to deliver the true seed again now this Mighty Angel comes to Abraham he makes a provision for the true Seed of Abraham to escape judgment and death Abraham types a prophet the angel comes to the prophet but he delivers the Seed of Abraham the mighty Angel comes down today to a prophet but he comes to deliver the true Seed of Abraham you and I he looks behind him Abraham you see the ram caught in the thicket of a bush remember I said that Abraham looks his eyes are lifted up and he looks he looks up and it seems now as if Abraham is looking up and he sees a ram caught in the ticket of a bush me the head of a ram in the bush the Hebrew word for am is the word AV it means ticket the ticket of a bush but that word has a dual purpose [Music] in other words when you read that you read it the ram the head of the ram is stuck in the thicket of a bush but the other meaning of the word have means a thick cloud lifted up his eyes and he looked he saw the ram the face of the Ram stuck in a thick cloud you see that brother and sisters now it's for believers it's our message today yes we're gonna look into the Bible and we see Isaac and Abraham and we say oh well such Grace Jehovah Jireh when we look in the Bible and Abraham says God himself shall provide a lamb and we look back two thousand years ago oh that was Grace 2000 years ago but what about today how does that scripture fulfill today and so the Hebrew word for AV means sticking up a bush or it means a thick cloud means when Abraham lifted up his eyes and he looked in the sky he saw a thick cloud and in the thick Cloud was a face a realm of a heart of a the face of a horn the horns of a Ram stuck in that cloud you see that brown sisters in other words Abraham lifted up and looked he saw in the ticket of a cloud a Ram's face the ram the face of a Ram stuck in the cloud you see what's happening on Mount Moriah Mount Moriah is the exact same spot where the temple was built later on where the holy Place laid on that mountain it was the exact same place the cloud would go and sit behind the most holy place means a cloud was going to descend on that mountain on Mount Moriah and Abraham yeah entitled looking up and the ram is stuck in a cloud it's our message brothers and sisters the two events I'll prophesied Young montmoriah Abraham speaks about the first coming in lamb and then God reveals the second coming a Ram stuck in the ticket of a cloud on the day of the crucifixion the prophet says when Christ hung on the cross the lamb he says that the priest went into the temple and he was offering incense in the temple and Christ the lamb was hanging on the cross he says that when Christ gave up the ghost the Earth shook would not break and when the Earthship would not break the promises and the Bible says the temple veil went into it and said when the temple veil went into the priest looked out of the temple he saw a man hanging on the cross and the promise is the Lamb was hanging on the cross on that crucifixion day Christ the lamb hanging on the cross cross Jehovah provided himself a sacrifice then the prophet brings it down to this day and he preaches an indictment message god making another provision he said the mighty Angels descended crying Grace Grace Grace but the promise of wine is bringing grace to the bride he says it brings judgment to the denominational world why because they crucified the word of thrush they put him on a denominational cross in this day and the Bible says Revelation 10 1 when he comes down he cries out with a loud voice seven Thunders are to The Voice what happened on Mount Sunset the Earth shut Like An Earthquake can you see the event replaying itself the prophecy of Genesis 22 being fulfilled Abraham sees a lamb Calvary God brings a lamb today's message they have the sticks that Christ must lay on they have the cloud in the sky the ticket of the cloud that will be crucified now on a dinama national cross you love the Lord the angel comes down the cloud appears on Mount sunset it's a face it's a face in the cloud because it's a ram in the ticket of a cloud and there's a face in the cloud means that his face is stuck in the cloud the ticket of a cloud the same lamb but he has white hair a dispensation change he's rejected in this day the word is crucified afresh in this day and what happens just like that they had Calvary there was an earthquake on Mount sunset the Earth shook and Bob says what happened in this day he said then the nominational veil renting too is that right brothers and sisters said that a denominational Veil went into this day he said we've been blinded by the normal National vein all of these years until this Angel comes down and opens the seal and the Bible becomes a brand new book and by the rejection of this message the denominational veil has been went into the Earth shakes and when the bride looks we look we lift up our eyes and we look Dame the ticket of a clown is a ram god making a provision for the bride thank you now the prophet says now we look beyond the denominational Veil like the priest now the veil was 22 and he looked beyond the Veil and the veil revealed a man hanging on the cross a lamb God's provision the word himself the logos materialized in human flesh was hanging on a cross the veil was ran now they look beyond the denominational Veil two thousand years ago the Jewish dinama National Veil the Jewish tradition they look past their tradition and they saw God's provision on the cross now when we are stuck we are like Isaac we should have been put to death a spiritual death but God has made a way for us God has made a provision for us a Ram stuck in a thick cloud and what happens when they're rejecting the denomination of veil renting too now we can lift up our eyes and we can look and we can see God's provision it's the same word the same logos God himself coming down in this age if it was someone else it'll be unjust it had to be he himself coming in this age to come and take us out of a denominational death we look past the denominational Veil we lift up our eyes and we see a Ram stuck we see a face in the ticket of a cloud Bible said who was worthy to take the book the lamb was worthy to take the book and the lamb has come down this day but he's come with a white wing making him a ram make him a judge the older than the older version of a lamb or the different dispensation that is revealing himself and he comes to judge those that reject this message he's the Ancient of Days he's the white wing one he is the Lamb that has come with Grace but dressed in a white wig as a ram we look into the cloud we look into the sky well the BAM says there was no moisture in the sky at that height for the cloud to be formed said there was no moisture that cloud in the sky what happened that day on the 28th of February brother and sisters was God confirming his word what was spoken in Genesis 22 God put it in the sky what was prophesied in Genesis 22 when there was no moisture gone by his own word sent his word for it had a creative power it put a cloud in the sky I hope you understand what I'm saying you read Genesis 22 there is the word of God thousands of years later the word that went forth to Abraham it materializes on Mount sunset God's word becomes materialized and it puts a cloud in the sky where there's no moisture there the same one that created the squirrels in the wilderness when there was no squirrels there God bring his word to pass God's God's Own creative power after his word has gone forth God himself has done it in this day he does not leave it for the nominational church it does not leave for a movement it does not leave for a man he did not leave it to William Branham but God himself becomes the sacrifice this day God himself created a cloud when there was no Cloud God himself comes again to deliver us public denominational death God's provision the logos of the word his creative power went beyond and it created himself this day in the form of a cloud a sacrifice for us Abraham call the name of that place verse 14. Genesis verse 14. Abram called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said even to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen the reference they they are referring to here Mount Moriah is the Jewish temple says even till this day it shall be seen but what shall be seen what does the temple have to do with what happened on Mount Moriah because there the lamb was slain for the ram was slain of Mount Moriah but at the Temple mount the lamb is not slain Jesus was slain here but what happens in the temple the cloud appears in the temple what happened in Genesis 22 was not a lamb was a ram a ram is Av the thickness of a cloud and here the scripture says and Abram called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen what is sin there's a temple built on the exact same place the exact same place the cloud descends and rests Beyond the Veil take the bride reads the same scripture today we'll read it like this and the scene of Abraham call the name of this place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord mount Sun said it shall be seen God has provided himself a sacrifice this day we'll received a Capstone message Jehovah Jireh is manifested to his reveal word in this day Jehovah Jireh has made a provision for the bride this day we were laid on the denominational man-made cross the destined for Spiritual death but Jehovah Jireh made a provision he come himself in this hour he become that rejected word this hour he become the bleeding word this hour God provided himself a ram and because jovajara has made the provision we have passed from Death To Life eternal life we have gone past the denominational Veil we have crossed over on the other side with ram says we have broken past tradition we have come into the promise word for age like Isaac passed on dead unto life we the two seed apart from debt to eternal life we are passed from denominational Darkness to the bright light the same Cloud the Bible says that gave light to Israel put Darkness upon Egypt we have come out of the doctors of Egypt and we are walking in the light of the cloud we are walking in the light of the bride's light this hour the logos himself the word is here and he's God's perfect provision for us today when we lay down the denominational cross he said I'll provide myself a ram for the Bride of Jesus Christ they won't die the spiritual death they won't die in darkness but I'll provide a light for them I'll provide a way for the Bride of Jesus Christ This Day we can take Genesis 22. Abraham and the Mount of Mariah and we can say this day this scripture Genesis 22 is fulfilled in our lives Jehovah Jireh was made a provision himself coming down a mighty Angel declaring to this Prophet it is I am said it is six seals that reveal himself but the seven seal brings him back to Earth it is our Lord up there it's God's perfect provision Jehovah the one that exists and wants to reveal himself the one that sees and sees to it and provides for it God's provision was the word the logos himself God become the word the logos himself God become flesh the lamb 2000 years ago and God himself comes this day as a ram to make an appropriation of our sin again take us out of spiritual darkness and spiritual death into eternal life is Jehovah Jireh to the bright today himself has come not left it for someone else but he's come to deliver the Bride of Jesus Christ and now what is he given us he's given us his own word that is being made flesh he didn't give us any kind of word he gave us the word that was there in the original the original word is the spoken word [Music] and now the books that we are reading is not a coincidence it's called a spoken word of God means that God has put back into the church the spoken word again has made a provision for us brothers and sisters and restoration this morning shall we all stand I land over to God Seven hallelujah amen you appreciate the word of the Lord amen hallelujah surely we can Rejoice around the things of God and the revealed word for the hour amen hallelujah you know the prophet they were baffled at this cloud and nobody else could explain the cloud nobody else could explain this amen they took it to scientists nobody could explain it even now it remains a mystery amen but the prophet explained it amen Oral Roberts didn't explain it Billy Graham didn't explain it but William Branham explained it and they said why don't you go down to the scientists and tell them he said it's not for them he says don't take your pearls and cast it before swines they won't believe it anyway amen hallelujah so this the reason why This Cloud existed there where there was no moisture this is not a rain cloud this is seven angels that formed the cloud and the prophet of God says that the Angels himself was his wig amen hallelujah and that's where we were in that story of Genesis 18. remember it comes with two parts now so the message fits in properly there amen first he comes to Abraham and Sarah to tell them they're going to bring forth the Son and the second part of Genesis 18 he's going down his judge to Sodom and Gomorrah amen so the prophet says there's three things that lay before us now amen hallelujah in the anointed ones at the end time and he talks about these three things that lay before us now Sodom amen the Earth is in a certain condition amen he says Janice and jamaris are rising up again amen and isn't it strange that now in a certain condition they are talking about new bodies in a perverted form they're not happy with their body they're talking about body change that's the trans movement now they want a body change so that in a perverted way they are talking about body change they're not happy in their own body but it's a perversion of us and the expectation for our new body amen hallelujah and I'm glad that the Bible called him a ram because a lamb could be male or female right [Laughter] but when he said a ram amen hallelujah a ram is a male amen Jesus Christ amen hallelujah praise the Lord and then Revelation 10 7 when he shall begin to sound not she when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God will be finished amen so some wonderful thoughts amen we can go on and on just uh elaborating on those thoughts but really appreciate the word of the Lord let's give the Lord a good answer of risk amen one of the beautiful thoughts that I had there was when the brother was preaching amen and he's talking about how God when he has a uh his first thought is a perfect thought amen he said what it's the first decision is the perfect decision the first thought is a perfect thought now when you are thinking about the Redeemer would the Redeemer be the first thought or the one who's Fallen be the first thought why would you have need of a redeemer if there's nobody to be redeemed what's it saying brother Joshua is telling me last week Redemption is for you you were giving me a nice saying there last week hey yeah yeah creation and Redemption Redemption amen God created the Earth God created the Redeemer to redeem us so who would he have thought of first when he had thoughts of Jesus Christ because we are part of him he had to think of us so we were part of first thoughts so that's why I'm saying you had a perfect thought greet your brother and sister and say God bless you perfect thought you're a perfect thought amen some of you are husbands telling your wives that and they're like yo perfect thought amen amen amen he knew me yet he loved me amen what a glorious father this is and that's why the Bride Can Rejoice you know we've we've gotten so accustomed it's been a long time that we just fellowshipping around the message of the hour that we've forgotten where God took us from this denominational rut filth amen where they crucified the word they've gone for Creeds and dogmas amen they lay aside the scriptures you show them baptism they don't want to believe it you show them goddess they don't want to believe it you show them no women preachers they don't want to believe it but we have been restored back to the original word amen and the Bible says heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away you look up to the first Bible the zodiac is still there you look to the second Bible the pyramid in spite of the flood the pyramid still stands the pyramid Woods to the flood because that was God's second Bible and this is God's written form of the Bible now these heavens and earth will pass away but his word all three forms are here the heavens the pyramid and the Bible and now all of that the word has become flesh in you and me amen amen they don't have to look to the heavens anymore they don't have to look to the pyramid anymore and the prophet says sometimes they don't even have a bible to read but when they look at you they look at me it's the only Bible they will ever read so how much we ought to say Lord Make Me In Your image amen let's sing be it unto me according to Thy word amen we can find it out there in the woods amen be it unto me that's what Mary said you know I was thinking Mary is really a beautiful name but nobody really names their daughters Mary I wonder why but it's a beautiful name brother Caleb if you're looking for a name amen Mary the then the prophet saying pick up your pen and write as the word was in Mary not as it was in Sarah not as it was in Eve not as it was in any other woman but he says as the word was in Mary blessed are thou amongst all women that would highly favored as the word was in Mary so shall it be formed in thee amen from Eve praise the Lord it unto me according to your word according to your promises I can stand secure and come upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word O Lord be it unto me let's sing it again be it unto me according to your word according to your promises I stand secure so carve upon

believed the Angel's message and she said be it unto me according to Thy word we have heard an angel of the Lord come down in Revelation 10 on Mount sunset amen come to us and tell us take this book that Revelation 10 7 is revealing take the message that William Branham is preaching yes and eat that wood and that word will start to change you amen it'll be sweet in your mouth but in your belly but when you begin to eat this word you become the prophetic voice you become the final voice that's why he tells it in Revelation 10 8. to 11 verse 11 thou must now go and prophesy again because you are the final voice you are the prophetic voice in this hour amen and the bride says Bride As thus saith the Lord or we keep still amen let's sing let us rejoice and let us be glad for the marriage of
