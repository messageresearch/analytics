all the media that's going around every news is bad news but we have the good news amen amen the good news of the Gospel amen amen the this word that's open to us right amen whereby we can see the things that are happening around us amen am and therefore we cannot be deceived amen amen because this is the age of deception right amen the greatest deception is in this age amen but this is the age where the mind of Christ has come down amen so this bride knows the has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word and she only moves when he says move amen amen because she's one with the word amen she's coming to full submission to the word yes sir we're not claiming to be holier than thou people but we are claiming to be one that come into full submission to the word and when we come into full submission to the word then amen then he has already satified us he's already Justified us he's already made a way for us he made provision for us and because his spirit is in US yes amen you can only be the only people of God when the spirit when the Holy Spirit is in you and when his spirit is in you then you are the holy people of God amen amen amen because you have to come through a new birth because your first birth brought you in a problem your first birth brought you in a slave and bondage it brought you in a spirit of fear but by the new birth you no longer have the spirit of fear but of power and of a sound mind amen and by this birth now you recognize your true potential by this birth you recognize who you truly are where you truly come from because your birth brings you into connection with your father amen but the first birth your connection came to your Earthly father brought you into the natural body but when you come at a new birth you come into your connection through your Eternal Father amen yes sir which is God amen amen amen if you got your Bible this morning morning we'll turn to the Book of Revelation chapter 13 read from vers 11 let's see what the Lord has in store for us this morning the Book of Revelation 13 11 says and I beheld another Beast coming out up out of the Earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercises all the power of the first Beast before him and causes the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast who whose deadly wound was ill and he doth great wonders so that he make it fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the own by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he caused it all both small and great rich and poor free and born to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or shall say he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name yeah is wisdom let him that had understanding count the number of the Beast which is the number of a man which is number is 63 score and six amen you may be seated amen so we want to put emphasis on the verses 12 and he exercised all the power of the first Beast before him and causes the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly un was healed okay so we know the first Beast represents uh Pagan Rome becoming people Rome right which was Catholicism right we know that right and the second beast represent the United States which started as a lamb yes Christian Nation right but yeah we see now later speaks like a dragon so it's going to exercise the power of the first beast and so we know the this image to the Beast is actually the Protestant Church United with the Catholic church was The ecumenical movement the World Council of churches right what they doing they're forming a religious political system just like it was in the days like how the Catholic Church did amen because we now we we want to put emphasis on his part he exercised all the power of the first Beast before him so we know that this Beast the second beast is the United States so we must look at what power was exercise but the first Beast because we want to see what power he's exercising now so we want to speak on this morning by the grace of God on the title Revelation 13 and America in the last days and on the coming squeeze of the Bride amen so we know the prophet speaks about history repeating itself so we find something very significant here because we're looking at the scripture in vers 12 which says that this Beast is going to exercise the power of the first Beast so when we look at history we find that you you know the the proper in the church age book he teaches us about Constantine who played a significant role in the corruption of true [Music] Christianity and we know that Constantine was more a political figure rather than what he portrayed to be as a Christian because the prophet of God told us that he wasn't he didn't have a true conversion but it was portrayed as if he had a conversion because when Pagan Rome was falling apart because remember even at that time when Pagan Rome was falling apart the Christians were persecuted there was a persecution of Christianity and even Nero before Conant Constantine he burned Rome and he blamed the Christians and then they they come to realize that it was not why are they doing this to Christians and Constantine realized that there were so many people being influenced by Christianity and he realized that a way to save this kingdom was to get on the side of the Christian amen or to get them to be part of the states and that's when we see church and state uniting together which was forming the bases that later will flow into the the paper room but this was the emperor that set the stage in order this was the emperor that said that he had a dream and you know the the dream that he had that he was going to it was just happening at a time before he was going to go to a war and he he saw a vision of oh he says that he saw a vision of a cross in the sky with the words uh in in when you convert it it means in this sign conquer so what he did he adopted the Christian symbol of the Cross and establish to everyone that he was converted but we know the prophet of God told us it wasn't a conversion but what he wanted to do it was a strategic move M it was because remember he was the emperor and he had a kingdom that's falling apart but it was a strategic move to unify his empire under a single religion blending Christianity with paganism and to make it a Empire a force to reckon with because that's what happened we see the Tyranny and the force of the Roman Empire at the time so what happened was that became more a political church when church and state unite it becomes a political church but we know in the uning time and sign we know that there's also a true Union not between church and state but between the bride of Christ which had the new birth amen she she was connected to her father because your birth brings you in connection to your father and when she comes under the new birth she comes under this Divine connection and realizes that she come from God and that she must go back to Goden then she realizes that she's not part of this world this world Cosmos yes this world system she's not part of she might have been stuck in those denominations she might have been stuck in the chicken barnyards but when Mama Eagle came crying out when the shout came out Amen to germinate that seed within her when a shout came and captivated her she began to realize who she truly is she began to realize why she couldn't conform to the chicken barard she began to realize why that chicken food couldn't satisf fire her she began to realize there was something more about her amen amen so we find that under constantin's rule there was a formation of a political church cuz why he declared Christianity the favorite religion of the Roman Empire and he began to give the church political power and this led to the nicolan spirit ruling over the lady which the prophet to us was condemned in the book of re ration amen amen yes amen so what it was the blending of paganism and Christianity doesn't that remind you of aab and Jezebel aab to unify and strengthen his kingdom he brought Jezebel in he come into a marriage Union with Jezebel only to know that he was a backsliding person and because he was in his back in condition he eventually it would be Jezebel's rule over Israel not ahab's rule it was Jessel Beyond The Throne yet aab was there back and preacher but who was influencing it was Jezebel influencing behind the throne so we know that in the days of Constantine they allowed Pagan Customs to be merged with Christianity leading to the eventually leading to the formation of the Catholic church because after Constantine there was another person who would come in and him through him would come now the pap he become the first pope and and and then you find the pap system in full power and you have the Dark Ages so you find that so who he was who was Constantine really he was basically deceiving he was deceiving about his conversion but only the two Believers at that time time the true Holy Ghost believers who wouldn't want to be influenced by church and state coming together they wouldn't be part of the system they wouldn't be deceived by this because they realize that this system is not of God they realize that the church has to be led by the Holy Spirit not being influenced by political influence amen amen and they knew according to the scripture that it wasn't the time of Millennium Reign because one day Christ will come again amen because there was a promise in the scripture that Christ will come as son of David Son of David he'll come to rule and reign as king of kings amen amen he's coming the days as son of man as the prophets amen he's come as Son of God but he must come in between the son of man again before he comes as son of of Davids but the True Believers know that and they wouldn't come into the system and then what happened the people that will come in system they was given political status and they was given positions in the church they was given uh property they was given land they was given all these rights but I want you to watch it's all deception and it was the beginning beginning of the departure of a Apostolic Doctrine leading to the r rise of Catholicism and ultimately spiritual corruption that continued Through the Ages until we find now this land America the United States that started off as a lamb where the people fled for freedom of religion which wanted to come out of church and States who wanted to come out to worship the one true God which wanted to recognize In God We Trust which build a constitution on the foundation of the principles of the Bible yes sir and wanted a religion where that doesn't where it doesn't mix up with states where is not influenced by politics and they wanted to follow the Bible the way it's supposed to be because God has put the five4 Ministry in place to bring the church to Perfection amen amen amen amen and we find that we are living in a time now where America eventually the prophet of God say it was under Kennedy President Kennedy that aab came into the White House because woman was given the right to vote and under the woman's vote it brought the wrong man in it might have been good in the side of the people but what they didn't realize they brought aab in which will come into a union with Jezebel and that's where it will start this nation that started off as a Godly Nation will turn away from god Till eventually they come into such moral Decay oh yes into such a Sodom condition that now they were cry for a Superman someone to save them instead of crying out to God the Bible said those that are full with the Holy Ghost sigh and cry for the abomination of the Lost instead of recognizing God's true prophet in the land that came and told them about this jel system amen yes sir when God's true Prophet was in the land in message was rejected they had an opportunity to repent and believe the true prophet of God but instead of believing the true prophet of God they were setting the ways they were happy accumulating their wealth they was happy living in a in a Land of n of national of being a patriot country because why they was focusing on being Earthbound they was focusing on the flesh caral things but what they didn't realize God's Prophet work that land amen and he measur that land with a yard stick amen they were found wanting waiting the balances of God yes and the message of the hour was rejected and what what happened they went into moral dek right and when they went into moral DK just want to read this one P you he said the strange behavior of Moses and Moses Elijah and John withdrawing from the people into seclusion left many confused they did not realize that it was because their messages had been rejected but the seed had been sown the planting was over oh yes judgment was next and they had served their purpose as a sign to the people so what was next and judgment was next I believe according to Revelation 13:16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the Beast is demanding the mark in the end or for if permission to preach be granted the nominations will take the Mark or be forced to put preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great others so we know who the mother is the mother is Rome the Bible say the mother is the home but the daughters are hars our daughters are who every denominational system coming from the Protestants right doesn't in a time of moral Decay doesn't religion seem good in a time where where America has become so bad in such moral decay the moral morality has declined so badly that wouldn't it seem good if somebody come and speak good things let's stop the moral Decay let's bring religion back wouldn't that seem good but then if that seemed good did it help then when we had Pharisees and Sadducees who followed the law were holy people was that just what God wanted good did God just want good morals did God just want good ethics no he wanted us to come into submission to the words amen amen amen he called the people to come to full submission to the words amen amen did God ask us to rely on any man no that's what the people of the world is looking for a Superman and he said they'll have the superman but we find this Beast the second beast he exercises all the power of the first Beast before him and cause the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast so there must be a political power and influence so strong because this Beast is America the second beast is America but it must come to a time where the the influence is so strong and so forceful that that she must influence the rest of the earth yes to go under the policies of Rome right and we find that that can't happen under moral DK it has to be in deception because if Satan comes in and shows you in Sodom condition and the people in Sodom condition you're going to you're going to know that he's ungodly but if he going to bring it in the form of religion all those lukewarm Believers or all those lukewarm Christians like aab and so forth they're going to be deceived they going to think this is a good thing amen and what happened when church and state comes together what's going to happen you're going to find that people will be given certain Privileges and they going to think that's a good thing amen we know that Constantine he claimed to see the vision of the Cross but we know that by his action we use Christianity for political gain and through what the proper has shown us amen I know that many Christian authors and historians Proclaim him to be Christian but the prophet of God told us what he used it for amen amen and we see right now in modern America with the current events that are happening we see there's a president that presents himself as a champion of Christian values which seems like a good thing after having a president that supported all the Sodom condition but we find that you can't make church and state together yes amen and to come to profess to be a Christian or to come the Christian value you must be born again until you are born again you have no connection to the father amen amen your natural birth your natural body was because of a it brings you to a connection to your Earthly father you come out of the loines of your Earthly father but when you have a new birth now you're connected to your father amen that is why you can fully submit to your father that's why you can truly understand that you have eternal life amen amen because you you know your father is eternal amen so we find that the Constantine made Christianity the official religion of Rome he merged church and government power we find right now America as it founded it was declared as a Christian Nation that's the true founding of America but right now we find that even now more so there's now political alliance with Evangelical of America yes Evangelical leaders evangelicals are aligning themselves with the current administration of America and we know what brought remember Constantine was going to a war into a battle and before he goes to the battle that's why he professed to have this vision of the Cross yes and then to get the Christian on his side that's how you won the battle now we know that the elections in America they were speaking about Battlegrounds and we know how the current president president got his votes it was through the Catholics and through the evangelicals it wasn't just the Catholics it was all the conservatives Christian people Catholics and Protestants together right people want was tired of moral Decay they wanted a change but we said the true change can only come with God's son forming power am they had a true hero in America God's Prophet amen they had a true hero to rely upon they could have taken God's Prophet as the hero because he War them of the oncoming storms of judgment before they even go to World War II he told him America will going to World War II and he told them he given he say if you repent I give America the chance to repent and they had the chance to repent but they refuse now we find that all this seems Rosy all seems good but this political alliance with evangelicals the Protestants and the Catholics eventually they will make it into a formal religion where will formalized laws and those that come against them preach against I mean he given uh a preacher Paula White k a big position in the White House to lead this Faith movement he's given a Jersy Bell preacher a position now if you going speak against these things you think that will be light if you going to speak the truth that a woman shouldn't be preaching in the first place yes sir which are apart from the message which other institution which other people will truly prophesy these things again yes which other people hold on to God's word as it is and say a woman should be preaching an adulterous woman Paula White and Kane look at her name her last marriage by because of her last marriage took the name Cain so we looking at these things happening now we see that there's a big uh push for Christian nationalism just as our Constantine use Christianity SOL SOL solidify power to bring power together and now we find that there going to be laws in there's laws put in place now executive order sign for for people that will come against Christianity that for Christian for people who now will uh come against this Christian worship all that seems good isn't it wouldn't that be good they bring in laws to protect Christianity but in that same laws can be amended to go against certain beliefs yes amen amen so we find that evangelicals aligning with political power same with the the Catholic church and the that is remember under remember that clip we played in the time of Kenneth copelan sending the message to the that that priest came to Kenneth Copeland's church and he also met to the pope how they said that the Reformation is over I mean sorry the protest the protest is over yes and how they all came into alignment with the Protestant church and the Catholic church that was the start of it but now they needed the political influence there was now the religious influence but they needed now the political influence to push all these things together to form an image to the Beast to make this image live so we find that at a National Prayer breakfast in February which happened the last the other day the president Trump announced initiative to combat perceived anti-christian bias within the F federal government he stated this is his word we will not allow discriminations against Christians to stand now I'm taking you back to history about Constantine I want you to think about that now under my Administration we are forming a task force led by attorney general Pam Bondi to root out anti-christ bias in our government so now they even got a task force to root out anti-christian bias so they have all the laws in place which is very which seems very good but eventually these very people the very Christians that are part of all this in here are going to influence the government that's right and say they are people they speaking against us they are people are coming against Christianity they are not part of the organized church and they can be very dangerous because they're not organized they don't have seminaries they got people who are not not thought to our Bible colleges they can be Reckless they can speak about hateful things and jeopardize Christianity amen amen do you for these things the prophet of God opened these things to up we have the book the seals are open amen so during the same event Trump emphasized the importance of faith in public Life Sharing he spoke about we must bring back bring God back in our schools and public squares Faith makes us strong amen right so which is a good thing there's nothing bad about that but here one comment that he made nobody has done more for Christianity or for evangelicals or for religion itself than I have see when you put the eye there yeah Christianity has been spread throughout the world through the working of the Holy Ghost that's right amen and through Holy Ghost men and wom come on Amen yes sir no man can have a claim on on doing more for Christianity then the Holy Ghost himself hallelujah amen amen and you can't take the title in America when God's Prophet was in that land yes yes amen amen amen so all this seems very good because if you go and type it out what would happened in the in the time of Josiah he also took away those the wrongful things those Pagan things and all that being the Trump being the 13 from JFK as past Adan gave us the illustration and Josiah being the 13 from a the 13 King but it was that the good thing that was done at that time was short lived because the sins of his fathers were so bad yes the sins of America are so bad that that eventually no matter what happens no matter how good the time seem America is doomed she can't go back it was short lived if you look at the story of Josiah you'll see there he brought back the proper brought back the proper worship and everything into took out the broke down the altars of pagan Worship in Israel in Judah but he was the last after his Reign after he died in the Battle of Mido they went into captivity because because after his son took over for a very short period in the time remember during Josiah's time just when Jeremiah the prophet of prophesying yes and how did they go into captivity who took them into captivity Babylon yes and where will America go into spiritual Babylon she's getting soaked into spiritual [Applause] Babylon so we find that all seems good but God is calling us to be OD balls amen our life is not to be the same like every other human being on the earth amen therefore we are OD B we are all to the ordinary person we don't look at things like every other ordinary person amen because why we have a connection to where we truly come from we are we have another dimension open up to us that while people are looking at Earthly things we are eagles we are showing like eagles we are looking up Beyond From Another Dimension we're looking from above not from beneath amen and we begin to see things clearly through eagle eyes and we see all the things around us that's why in this age of great deception when everything seems so good it's not good amen we can see through the eyes of God that it's all filth and moral Decay and we can see that the God of this evil age this is his kingdom but we see that the kingdoms are trembling amen because God Daniel's prophecy must come to pass the kingdom of this Earth must crumble and God is ready to set up his kingdom but he cannot set up his kingdom without people amen so therefore when you come into connection with God and you come in all the reason why you an OD because you are from another kingdom amen therefore the prophet give us the analogy of the slave boy the slave boy his character was different to all the other slaves because why he recognized he he never forgot yeah might he might have been taken away but he knew he knew his true identity he knew that I'm trapped here I am trapped in his ptil amen he knew that I'm trapped here as a slave to the system but I know my true identity when the Jubilee comes when the Jubilee trumpet sound I will go free amen I won't be a slave anymore I will go back to to what I truly am as the king son my father is the king of the tribe and that's where I'm going to be but I don't want to lose my identity so let me continue conducting myself as the King's son amen amen even while I'm here right now it might be a temp just a temporary time but while I'm right here let me conduct myself as the king son amen so that's what made that that slave difference because he knew his true identity he knew where he come from and he knew where he's going to go and he knew that he's there for a period of time but the Jubilee Trumble was going to sound but he knew that I can't just go there for I'm going to be here for so many years a while the time I'm here if I conduct myself like the rest of the people when I go to my father's Kingdom how can I conduct myself now as the King's son no I got to conduct myself as a king son while I'm here so when I go into my father's Kingdom I will put into my position amen so therefore you find yourself rightly divided into the body of Christ where God has placed you because why you are forming this pyramid City while you on the earth amen then when we leave here we live as a PID City when we come back in the Millennium Reign we come back as the PID City amen amen so we find now right now currently they pushing for laws to enforce religious principles in America and we find that all seems good that all religious are joining them and eventually and what makes it so good is because they went into such moral Decay and just before this Administration he was pushing agenda that was so bad we know that even in the time of jiah he stopped that Pagan worship where where will they will sacrifice children and so forth and under this presidency they're talking about now stopping the they they speaking for pro life against abortion and so forth but we find that the second beast it must speak for the dragon it must exercise the power of the first Beast because that is the scripture Revelation 30 must be fulfilled and this will put into place this whole entire ecumenical movement with laws that will come again Target the bride of Christ and they will try to put pressure on the bride but this bride the prophet of God said nothing not one bomb will fall nothing will happen as long as this bride is on the earth amen but we are all this is happening at a time where the bride has come to maturity when she knows what to do with the word it's coming in a season and hour where the doors have been open to her Amen to the Unseen World and where all things are possible yes where the endless possibilities amen amen amen so they can do what they want they can challenge the economy right now even South Africa is getting scared of what's going to happen to the economy if you going to focus yourself on living under South Africa's economy yeah come on then you're going to be living in a time of being enslaved to depression and all the things that goes on with the people of the world yes sir yes sir that's right but we are living under our father's economy our father is Je he is our provider Amen in the time he said why can I speak and a child will cry and will get what they wants yeah but when a person is mature right in this age of maturity come on in the age of adoption yes sir amen he said now don't cry you're not a baby anymore when you was a Pentecostal baby you cried the gifts was coming to you the gifts of pouring into the church but this is not the hour to cry but it's the hour to speak yes sir amen and you only can speak when you recognize your true identity you only can speak when you recognize your connection to the father hu you only can speak when you recognize that all host of Heaven is backing you amen amen amen and you only can speak when you are certain of God amen hallelujah amen amen we find this the two on beasts that that the Revelation speaking about the two ons were symbolizing church and state speaking as a dragon America will eventually they're going to abandon the foundation of religious freedom and they'll Force laws against the true worshippers because they amalgamating with the c Catholicism you can see what happened even in the in the presidency you had the Jew you had the Catholic and you had the Protestant so it's the uniting of protestantism and Catholicism to bring about that one world religion it was being already being done amongst Protestants and Catholics but it needed the might the military might the political influence of the of the USA because she was able to give power to the first Beast amen amen so we speaking about this America which is the which is forming now the union of church and States so you see even in the Bible History teaches us that the danger of religious and political life es we saw how the church eventually had to go through the Dark Ages the true church how they had to get persecuted if they didn't fall under this uh organized religion that's why the prophet said is not against people but is against organized religion because Satan Works through organized religion he works through laws and system for Satan to come remember Satan will only come incarnate into the pope when the bride leaves the Earth amen but everything must be set for him to come he must have the laws put in place everything must be made in such a way not only laws must be put in place there must be systems in place to track down people that don't follow the system that is why you're finding all this artificial intelligence and all are coming up now because Satan can't is's not like God he's not all knowing Satan doesn't know everything amen he can't be in different places God can be God is God is a being he's by he's being by he go by every place because he's all knowing amen he's only present he's only omniscient and that's why he's only present amen amen but Satan is not like that Satan is going to have to use science he's going to have to use technology Amen to track down people who's not following the system how are they going to get you not to buy and sell you're only seeing part of it now when to start putting cars and so you only seeing the start of thing because they can put sanctions they can put Terror if they can do that to countries how how is going to how easy it is to do it to people that own follow the system thank God we're not going to be here for that to happen amen amen hallelujah but they must come these restrictions they must come and targets where all Targets are are displayed and shown to the bride we must become the target amen because we will be the people that exposes the system they want to know how do you know these things how does this people know the secret they talking about these things they a thing that is information that has been leaked but a prophet of God who hear from God Amen who received the word from the seven angels coming down down amen come with a message come with the secrets amen come to unfold all Satan's schemes and what is happening Luke 21:12 says but before all this they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you so there'll be censorship of the word the true word they will allow religion yes but they will sense they have a sense the ship over the true word the unadulterated word yes you think all those big denominations can accept you to preach against preachers in a pul put come married two or three times woman preaches woman bobbing their hair all these things you think they're going to allow all that but the bride must stand on the word despite the pressure she will remain the OD ball yes she don't need to be influence she don't need any position of man she don't need to clim climb up any hierarchies and be in good books with any man amen she has to be faithful and submissive to her head to a head amen she come under full submission she she has come because of love amen she's so much in love with him that she become so much like him am all of his nature all of his characteristics she must display it amen she loves the thing that he loves amen hallelujah thank you Lord so we find that this pressure that will come this will bring the bride into a full manifestation am right now she's come to maturity but she had to feel that squeeze the prophet said you know when everything is nice to the the church the church go into a lazy condition but when the pressure comes she's no longer lazy she's on a KNE she's praying she's getting serious with God she's concentrating on the things of God but everything is just found for you when everything is complacent then what happen the church gets lazy amen amen that's why the church is thinking they're living in the Golden Age they're going to that's why they think that's how the Catholic Church look at the dark in the Dark Ages the Catholic Church didn't look forward to the Millennium they thought they were in a millennium they thought they were living in the Golden Age they had all the wealth of the world accumulated the wealth of the world they had full control full political power full influence on the earth yes and that's what's happening right now there must be an image to the Beast amen so we must have the token which is the literal Life of Christ and that is what the that death in The Bride will sustain her amen Isaiah 59:19 says when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up his standard against you Revelation 3:10 say because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour of Temptation amen amen we promised amen so we find that this bride must be sealed and positioned before the pressure comes on that's what the word is doing now that's what the 54 Ministry is doing building up his bride into come to a position amen and she must be sealed by the Holy Ghost amen and she must have the literal Life of Christ the token displayed amen Matthew 24:13 says but he that shall enjoy unto the end the same shall be saved amen so what we got to do now we got to hold fast to the revealed words we got to hold fast to the message of the hour we can't compromise with any man-made system we can't compromise with political systems of this world Amen we got to hold fast to this precious word amen the title lead that's come down that shown us our names in the book our title that sh us there I am in the book how do you know it you see it by faith and faith is a revelation amen amen how do you see Sarah as your type how do you see Ruth as your type how do you see Rebecca as your type amen how do you see these things by faith amen amen that's why God when he went to Sarah the first thing he would have to do there before the body changed he said take out the ey and name Shall be Called sah he give her the H amen amen therefore before the body change we had to have the name change amen amen took out the eye the eye WS our own worlds amen every time we when sh had the eye she was compromising she was reasoning she began to think what can I do look at me I I am old I can't do this I have to give you my made to fulfill the promise I can I was all I I I until the edge came amen and then Sarah could walk now in a position amen amen thank you Lord we you find that when you find church and state come together and all religion organized religion come together you as the bride will be the odd ball to them they will be an odd ball to us and we will be an odd ball to them amen you find basically what I'm trying to tell you that Revelation 13 He prophesies about the merging of church and state in the last days it's drawing a direct parallel to our Constantine United the Roman Empire and the Christianity and this Union was not to promote true Faith but to control religion for political power amen so similarly we seeing right now America the second beast will exercise the power of the first Beast Rome by enforcing religious laws that eventually would lead to the persecution of the true bride because she own be part of that that organized system but you see the pattern of the church and state throughout history we find the America is imitating Rome but the bride she must imitate every other believer that that came on from the true Pentecostal where our faith have turned back to the fathers so if they have been if America is exercising the power of the first Beast we must exercise the faith of the fathers amenallah the same faith that started the church amen the same Pentecostal faith and it moved on further right now with because if they if time had been more longer if they wasn't going to die and face death if they had to live on to the ages and come to this age they will walk out of this Earth they will also change Dimensions but we are to come in the day when the title leader to come down and we are to receive a word and this word will make us leave this Dimension change Dimension this world will give us a body change amen it couldn't be done in any other age it had to be done in this age amen that's why in this day you had a prophet that one day while he's walking the Lord said now walk with me yes amen and then while walking even the deer could eat eat from his hand can come right up to him went and so come right back because why he had an experience of a body change right there if time went a little bit longer this Prophet this Earth couldn't keep this prophet he was going to leave he was going to walk out of the dimension that's how anointed this prophet of God was amen but that was just a type and Shadow showing what will happen to this bride amen because why this bride is walking under the reveal word she's separated from every organization or religion that is why we don't compromise with Creeds we don't compromise the tradition we don't compromise but say I belong to this Culture I Belong To That culture yes because what your natural birth made you to realize you of a certain skin color you of a certain origin and then it made you then you learn to e different skin religion but under the new birth there's no Creed there's no Dogma there's no black there's no white there's no yellow we all are one amen we are baptized into one body we all from one family we all have one father amen yes amen amen that is why under this true baptism of the Holy Ghost under the new birth we can come together in true peace in true Unity while the world is saying peace peace they trying to bring peace and unify that's a false peace that's a false hope prophet of God said America is doomed she might live A short time under a righteous leader like in the time of Josiah but the Doom is there the Doom is set nothing's going to change that prophet of God prophesied thus say the Lord he spoke about what will happen to America the kings of the north will get together we know what will happen right now you see them all getting together yes and we know what our Jezebel will come to end our America will come to an end we know that Russia that seven Vision must come to pass but he said not one bomb will fall till the bride until the bride leaves the Earth the bride won't be here but Russia got USA name on it it got Vatican name on it got them on the nuclear Target and that must come to pass we know what will happen to Los Angeles that is thus say the Lord amen so we can see all these things and we know that somebody must bring the Covenant because we know Vatican owns the gold the Jews own own the bond someone has to come in between and bring them together yes and the the only way you can bring the Jews in that Covenant which is we know is going to be a false Covenant because it's going to be broken the only way you can bring the Jews together is to compromise on the temple mounts yes cuz that's what they want they want that place there that's what the Jews want so someone has to bring that deal together the stage is all set now we are living in the stage where should what condition should the bride be in now what condition it should be an a rapturing condition amen it should be an condition where we not Living Earth bounds amen we are should be in a condition where you are in such maturity where nothing can stand in your way now where you have a need you know what to speak to that need how do you speak to need according to the word of God because why the characteristics the nature of Christ must be portrayed through you in and through this many membered body now let me tell you one of the character when you become so in tune and so much like Christ when you become in such an atmosphere do you know when Christ walked on the earth and the persecution came just before the persecution the persecution didn't last long right because after the crucifixion was what it was the resurrection so if the persecution comes they must know the resurrection can't be far amen the next thing to happen right now that we are waiting for we've received the shout the shout started the cycle of the Rapture amen because the Rapture is in a three-fold cycle the shout The Voice the Trump so if the shout already started and came and and call us in we will call under the shout the next event to happen is the resurrection now Jesus before the resurrection what happened you had to come the persecution you had to go to the cross and that wasn't a very long time and before Jesus goes to the Cross just before he goes to the Cross so many prophecies are being rapidly fulfilled yes amen rapidly fulfilled so right now when you see these things going to come and the persecution come the next event is the resurrection and all these prop will be rapidly fulfilled as history repeat itself scripture must repeat itself amen amen they must be types in the scripture that's how the prophet would speak about the resurrection how we're going to meet our loved one During the period like how it was in the days of Jesus during a period of 40 days he was on the earth the saint was on the earth they were seen by many Believers am it wasn't seen by other people because the Believers that to have SE that they were coming there in the dimension so just like that one of these days for a period of time we going to see Believers coming loved ones coming we're going to see them we're going to have fellowship with them we're going to really talk to them amen amen that's the [Music] promise so we find that like when same story when sh Mish and eano when they went into captivity they refused to bow to the system they were in Babylon but they refused to bow to the system they refused to bow to Nebuchadnezzar's image we might be cheed in the system of the world but we would refuse to bow down to any system of the world Amen we will not participate in any world world religion amen amen they can bring sanctions they can bring whatever but the bride will only follow what the bridegroom thing amen yes sir anything else she won't do she won't go flirt around am with manmade religions Hallelujah because she's so much in love with him amen she's so much in love with the word she's not willing to compromise cuz if she doesn't if she's not in love with him she can't follow that word it'll be LA to her she comes because of law of love because of her love for him she follows him amen amen amen am amen yes sir so what will happen eventually they going to accuse us of bringing division amen they're going to accuse us of being rebellious against the system they're going to accuse us of being hatred bringing hatred to against Unity when they all trying to be unified and we are speak against this false Unity they going to say you all are people of hatred you don't have love God is love they misrepresent God's love amen to the World God is love but they don't know the love of God is being submissive to his word amen it's being one is loving his word yes God's love is corrective God love brings you into Union amen and you can't come into Union if you're not coming one with the word amen that's what God loved he loved you so much that he brings you into a union that's why he said depart from me workers of iniquity I know you not there was no Union amen and the Bible says Adam knew his wife and she begat there had to be a union amen but yet there's no Union they want to take the name of Christ for the pur for their own self gain and say no we don't want to come into Union with you but we will use the gifts we will use the benefits amen but we don't want to come into submission to you but marriage is about submission amen amen marriage is about coming to Fellowship marriage eventually leads to another leads to a family and how it comes to family there must be a reproduction what it is Christ being displayed again that's the end sign amen Christ is played in a many membered body so the bride has the literal Life of Christ in know amen amen her faith is an upon the word yes amen nothing else yes so we must stand firm and not compromised right we must Trust on God's word because we are living in perilous times amen amen this is the hour that we living in perilous times upon the Earth but you need to stand firm and stand as one with authority recognize your true position recognize your true potentials you're not the tail you are the head amen you're not from below you are from above Hallelujah your father is the creator yes you might all the great people of the world you are above them yes sir so don't when you speak you speak as one with authority you don't speak as one being puffed up but one with authority amen knowing that when you speak what you say must come to pass amen because because he said whatsoever should ask my father in my name I that he shall give unto you if you ask anything in my name it shall be given unto you amen some CL can me go to the he says he has to be for that history is repeating itself from the time of a Israel's history under a is happening right here in America when the prophet of Malachi appear now we know there was in the time of JFK he spoke about that and he says I do not think that Mr Kennedy will have much effect now because he'll make a wonderful president in order to bring in the others to get a scene set just like they have in England like they did in Mexico like they did everywhere else like that then in the message on the pan Church age he say Constantine was all always considered and is by the people today the origination of the Knight of Columbus now the one that gave that Bloody o but Constantine I say this with reverence and respect to my way of reading it out of History never was converted now he dreamed a dream one night he SE a cross and said that by this he would win the battle and because that he had promised relief to the Christian that he would be a Christian if they would pray for him to win that battle and I stood by the bridge there and on the other side of bridge sleeping dreamed this dream and woke up and painted a white cross on the shield of East and all of his Warrior and there where formed the Knight of Columbus which is under the Roman Catholic domination domination but he never did one thing religious the only thing that he ever did that wrote in history as I've ever seen was he put a cross on top of St Sophia's church but he was a politician and he and when he was the emperor of Rome at that time he and his Pagan priests together Consolidated and brought in the lukan church called nicolan at that time Christianity which was leaning toward priesthood and wanted it in their church that we have taken in future studies of the Church of Ephesus and so forth and of SMA those nicolan now nicolan has become not de like it was back at the beginning here but yeah it's a Doctrine yeah it was deed they were just trying to get it in but over here in the third age it became doct high priest Great Fellowship call them popes yet now but they were called like Arch Bishop great fellows you know we now and the doctrine was it was formal they were getting away from the spiritful Holy Ghost L Church they let them go off in the minority and call them Heretics because they wouldn't agree with them to have their great denomination so who's in the minority now the bride is always in a minority but the church wanted to stay free under jurisdiction under the power of the Holy Spirit as Christ has promised them it be with them and that was their King oh their King the true church has never changed his attitude not to be ruled by some b or I don't know what you call them out there Cardinals and Bishops and popes infallible one we believe there one infallible one he is our King he is Jesus Christ who us now in the form of the Holy Spirit God in us living amongst us leading us and guiding us into the Waters of life making himself known showing as he did among those early Saints and martys that he was the living He he was the Lord God of creation Healing The Sick raising the Dead showing Visions casting out devil amen now he says in the Titan Church age paragraph 63 he says and now look at this watch this strategy and watch how the Bible confirms it God hundreds and hundreds of years before he taken place and constant and use the same strategy God said you that a abused I want you to see history repeating itself now Constantine seen a great part of this people where the these nians Christians some of them were called Heretics that's the Pentecostals they were Heretics and O rollers and what more they there's where your real signs and wonders laid but the church natural then was coming on up to the organization what did he do Constantine played a smart part he goes over there get his Pagan friends and get his Christian friends and unites the church together amen brought paganism into Christianity Christianity and paganism married into the pagamos church now what did he say over here to this tonight that same thing that aab did aab to strengthen his kingdom married Jezebel this idolatrous to strengthen his kingdom to get more strength into Israel he say when aab married Jezebel for political reason he sold his Birthright you join up with an organization and you sell your Birthright brother whether you want to believe it or not every Protestant group that ever came out and that went back sold their birth right and when you sell your birth right just like Esau you can cry and repent all you want but it w't do you any good yes there is only one thing you can do and that is come out of her my people and stop partaking of a sin now if you don't think I'm right just answer this one question can any man living tell me what church or what move of God ever had Revival and came back after she went into organization and became a denomination read your hisory you find you can find not even one now in the true Easter se he said and how as people sit there and brought this thing in just because of politics how I don't understand it but here we are right here on this Easter morning and the very thing the very reason we come to this country become American was for freedom of religion against that jelly Bell System and we turn right back around and elected on the platform of there in the White House the very thing that we come out here to be freed from it's a tremendous condition that we living in now you know that this church spiritual because it's sold out amen leave that one more quote here in a super sign he says let me make a prediction I'm not prophesying I'm predicting I predict that in the next few years that all organization religion will be forced to take a stand and they will have a union of churches and a great boycott will follow this Union of churches all denominations will be forced into it all of them if they don't they will be a horrible boycott nearly every one of them today has not knowingly join the World Council of churches selling their Bird right protest Brothers with the mother Catholic of Rome they'll do that you know and the Bible said that the tears will be bound bundle first they are bundling all in one great group the Bible said they will make an image unto the Beast yeah I believe it'll come to pass that shortly that if people do not join some organization some church go in their doors will be closed this nation has always Ted Israel Israel we find out come into another land took the occupants slay them run them out push them back and occupy the land just as we did the Indians then God gave them that land God gave us this land notice that what take place they are great men in them days Joshua a king they had David they had Solomon great men but finally it worked around till they got a renegade on the platform aab a lwam Believer it wasn't so much aab but it was that wife behind him Jezebel of another race of another class not an Israelite she was an ethen and Idol worshiper she was the one who done the Dirty Work she told a what to do and we have worked around in the same way and we've had a Washington a Lincoln after we pushed the Indians back and took their ground but what we but what have we done to politics we work the very thing in what we come over here for freedom from that's exactly right a jezebel arious and a Jacqueline married twice before living with a third hband living in there now and yet the people go for it blinded in their eyes and there it is you just watch we're going to reap what we s she's at the end I prophesied in 1956 when buly Graham would return and I said that Tommy Osborne would return and America would receive a last call several years ago I it predicted exactly the magnet line line exactly what would taken what would take place exactly K the what would take place and of this there would be a Catholic President ruling here and what it would be and just two more things left from seven things that he told me to happen perfectly that's right it's on yellow paper we at the end time amen amen so you see where we at now yeah this last quote he says but you remember when it went down and the grain begin to ripen that you find before the grain can ripen everything in the stock has to be dead so we find all denomination to be dried up amen they had the Revival they had the Ealing campaigns around the world but it all had to be DED up it all had to be did before now the grain could ripen then we had the process of the ripening of the grain amen can't you see where we standing life is in the grain again amen amen what is it just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground the same Jesus in the bright form same power same church same thing same word amen the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to into a head here and all that life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the Rapture amen amen he said speaking on that tomorrow night or next the Lord willing well you separated from your first Union by spiritual de now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union not of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you amen now your old book is gone with your old Union your name in your old book you has been transfered do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God Amen now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeem not the old book of your natural Union but your new bride Hallelujah your name your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your married certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you Justified Romans 51 therefore being justified by faith look up that word that word don't mean forgiven that word means Justified it don't mean you forgiven for instance you word have got drunk and that some evil things and everything then you come around say to me you found out that I didn't do them you come around say brother BR I forgive you forgive me I didn't do it in the first place amen now if I did do it I'm guilty but you could forgive me and I would be guilty but yet I'm not justified because I've actually done it but the word Justified is though you never done it amen it's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead and is not even in the memories of God Amen you are Justified therefore being justified it was accused you are you was accused you never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are the predestinated SE yes he said now how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve it's not it's no form of your own by your natural birth you come after Eve who committed adultery that's the reason you was born in adulterous you a sinner to begin with that's right you were deceived into it it ain't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world God put your name in The Lamb Book of Life am amen praise God let's stand amen amen
