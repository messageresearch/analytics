good anle of Praise amen good to see everyone the house of the Lord amen greet your brother and your sister say welcome amen amen haven't seen some of you look like we need to have some Zoom meetings and whatsa video call so I can see you more often amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah amen this morning we'll speak on character with power is foot to rule amen character with power is foot to rule amen there's certain character required Amen to operate certain scriptures amen hallelujah it's only locked up to certain people amen and it's only people that have a certain character like Mark 11:23 will be able to operate it Mark 16 even requires a the character because you get some characters who in a veiled way are disbelieving Mark 16 when I say veiled way when they tell you that healing is the part of the first and second pool they are basically telling you they're part of the old school that don't believe Mark 16 because Mark 16 is not based on any polls Mark 16 is based on them that believe amen so some people as soon as you tell them about healing of the power of God they equated to first and second pool and they say we in the third pool because they are dead as a door nail amen hallelujah they proclaim the opening of the word but no power amen so we've got to have both Dynamics and mechanics amen yes any church that doesn't operate Mark 16 is a dead church amen the scriptural identification of the True Church of God is Mark 16 can you say amen amen believe that amen by faith amen so character with power is foot to rule let's turn to one samel 13 and ver14 it's one portion of scripture I want to get you seated amen I realize that you've been standing amen for since the service started and sometimes we take so long to read the scriptures you're standing for 45 minutes we don't realize we have old people young people amen so we want to be sensitive to everybody amen maybe the song leaders me make you sit in between for one song or two je we got some old people here I was timing the some of the services and sometimes you're standing for 45 minutes sometimes 50 minutes before you get seated amen so let's be sensitive to that as well 1 Samuel 13:14 but now thy kingdom shall not continue this is's not talking to Saul so he had a bad character right that's what we getting to but now the Lord had sought him a man after his own heart amen and the Lord had commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee amen amen you may be seated the Lord bless you Lord bless his word amen amen then we'll turn to Genesis 6 and8 just one portion of scripture there Genesis 6 and8 but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord amen so there are specific Men Who Please the Lord what is it about them their character amen Hebrews 11:5 amen praise the Lord amen you can see verse 5 speaks about Grace and here we're dealing with no with Enoch it says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was found not because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony amen that he pleased God amen amen amen what a testimony to have amen that we are pleasing the Lord amen hallelujah and this testimony was not man's testimony yes the testimony that he had was God's testimony about his son Enoch amen man and Enoch the Lord didn't tell him you're going to go in the ark the Lord had reserved him to be translated amen amen so what kind of character did these men possess amen because we are coming now into a time in a season where there must be a certain character on display amen amen God the only person that's going to be raptured is Jesus amen he's the only one that qualifies for the rapture so we must be like Jesus amen and that is what the fivefold ministry is doing if you read Ephesians 4 it's telling you that the five for Ministry is designed to bring you into the image of Jesus Christ amen everybody agree amen uh we'll read just now in second Peter what their true character is amen praise the Lord so if we're looking at and we're starting there at Saul and David we can see the type of character that men choose by their natural eyes yes amen look look at what they chose and then look at what Israel chose amen they chose a man that was Head and Shoulders above any man in the nation he was great big fine handsome looking amen but the prophet says he was always a fly in the ointment amen but God says I'm going to choose you a king of my own choosing amen amen I want you before you get lost in the sermon to know that God has specifically chosen you because you are a son and daughter of character you possess qualities within you that God won't find elsewhere amen God predestinated you like that do you know God hates people and loves people before they are born amen hallelujah Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated amen so God Loved You amen and we ought to appreciate God for loving us in such a way thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen so he tells Samuel to go to Jesse's house and he say I'm not going to tell you who he is but you go up there he is one of Jesse's Sons amen so Jesse and his wife probably looked around and they presented the oldest son he was great tall handsome the prophet would say he looked just right for a king's crown he's smart educated a fine man I know you'll be right he speaks his words proper but when they brought him out and Samuel took the cruise of all and went towards him he says no the Lord has refused him so he went all all the way down through the Suns and then he says isn't there another yes amen hallelujah isn't there another and then when we find he says yes is's one he's out in the back hurting sheep he's back there and he plays songs he sings it he shouts and goes on Amen some real Pentecostal experience amen not some dead beat amen but somebody who has the life of Christ within him amen somebody who has the holy ghost power yes thank you amen how many if you know the prophet says the Holy Ghost want behave himself in one person this way and misbehave himself in another person that way so if the Holy Ghost is full of power the Holy Ghost is full of action amen ask yourself amen I can't stay silent in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah you know the kingdom of God suffered violence and the violence taken by force the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost amen and you must take the Holy Ghost by force because there are spirits that are not willing for you to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen but it's your inheritance the Holy Ghost is your inheritance amen so how would God take somebody who was born in sin shaped in iniquity came into this world speaking lies amen nothing good about ourselves how will he take us and equip us and get us ready for a Rapture body change how will he do it amen to make us Sons and Daughters of God I'm going to make this statement that God started the church in act in the book of Acts the way he wanted it to amen but now he wants to go he wants the church to go back to the way he started it I'll say it again God started the church in the book of Acts the way he wanted it now he wants the church to go back to the way he started it am amen I'm going to further that thought by telling you that God created Man In His Image in Genesis 1 yes the way you wanted man to be created now you want man to go back to the that original image the way God created and intended him to be this may seem like a foreign thought to the world but it shouldn't be a foreign thought here in the church that we are going back to our Godlike position where we shall have dominion and power over the Earth yes amen amen amen it may seem foreign to people that they can command things and it happens but yes it is so amen hallelujah praise the Lord and I'm so excited to be acquainted with sons and daughters of God who possess a Godlike character a Christlike character who is able to operate in the god-given abilities in this hour amen hallelujah I I'm privileged to walk beside you as Sons and Daughters of God amen amen who's going to defy gravity who's going to defy the powers of this world Amen Satan has come to clog man with unbelief and take away his true identity that he's a god of the Earth God created us to be a god of the Earth but Satan came and dimmed the eyes of the people amen but God is Reawakening his people to the what he created them for amen hallelujah so this boy that was out there was hurting sheep he was playing songs he was shouting amen every once and again he shouted hallelujah praise the Lord amen and he was operating with sling and stone amen hallelujah David was operating with sling and stone both the Dynamics and the mechanics amen hallelujah praise the lord we got too many people operating with stone alone amen hallelujah praise the Lord yes but it required both sling and stone that's what people have been doing Through The Years amen under the Vindicated message of the hour they have been operating with stone alone and they've been stoning people that's why the word of God couldn't penetrate the hearts of the people they were not using the sling with the stone David didn't take the stone and start to Stone Goliath it wouldn't have had the effect but he needed the sling amen some of you know what I'm talking about because you were part of them that were stoning people amen hallelujah it's not the way to present the gospel just beat people of the word but how about we apply a little spirit with it and amen the spirit can soften the hearts of people amen amen let him that is without sin cast the first stone amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord so we find that when when they bring s David out to the prophet and then the prophet can anoint him with the oil and he poured it on his head and said this is God's chosen amen not pretty but character God looks at character turn to your neighbor and say I am chosen I am chosen tell him you are chosen you are chosen amen praise the Lord amen so God is featured in character we know that the Bible says that there was no Beauty in Jesus that we should desire him amen hallelujah praise the Lord you find all my thoughts are coming from the prophet's message amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord there's no Beauty in Jesus that we should desire him but there was never a character like him on the earth Hallelujah and if we in His image and in his likeness if we are being built up in His image there's not a character like us there's not a woman like this on the earth there's not a bride like this on the earth amen you are royal priesthood a holy nation amen set apart for God Amen Hallelujah we know this famous saying amen that the beauty of the church is the character of the people if you're are looking for the beauty of the church we got to look at the character of the people and I'm thankful for sisters here that can amen identify themselves as as Daughters of God and be able to take the scripture and apply the word to their heart and conform to the standard of the word because it's not a popular standard but it is God's standard amen amen I'm thankful for men in the church that are able to submit themselves under the authority of the word because it is God's standard amen hallelujah we are not wishy-washy Christians amen hallelujah because Satan and his group looks for big beautiful churches amen Hal Hallelujah beautiful things that's what the world looks for today amen they're looking for a great big Pastor amen so Priestly and godly walking around with big robes they call that beauty amen but we find here what the prophet of God is telling us real saints of God look for the character of the Vindicated word amen that's the character we're looking for amen that's what the Saints did in that day when they seen Jesus he was nothing to look at but they seen God was in him they so they also saw God was in David they stayed right with him they knew the anointing was upon David and they know that David was coming into Power amen and aren't we glad that we know Jesus is coming into Power amen amen he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me but one of these days he'll take power over the Earth yes every King will have to bow down before him that's right amen hallelujah Biden will have to bow down before the Lord Jesus Christ Putin will have to bow down before the Lord Jesus Christ amen Kim somebody not the Sister Kim now Kim Jong I don't know what's his how you pronounce his name that North Korean leader will have to bow down before Jesus even netan will have to bow down before Jesus and ramapa and all of his beasts will have to bow down before Jesus am amen hallelujah hallelujah no matter how much they look up to men on the earth they can look up to MMA Gandhi because he was a good man they can look up to uh Nelson Mandela because he was a good man but never a man spake like our Lord Jesus Christ he's king of kings and he's Lord of lords he's the most influential person on the earth amen that's right and not only is influential on the earth he's also influential in heaven because heaven was about to come to a stand still because there was nobody found worthy to take the book amen but he was be able to influence heaven and he came there as a lion of the tribe of Judah able to take the book back to our title deed amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen you're in 147 of marriage and divorce a pure picture of the church today that will stand by the word of God Amen we know it's going to it's going to be made Vindicated we know it's coming into Power someday we know that he Jesus is coming into power too so we take that word and stand right there no matter matter what it cost if we have to cut Philistines or jump in the pit kill a lion as one did we go anyhow cuz that's the way God designed it to be we look for character amen so what are we learning here the character of a son and daughter of God is one who stays with the word amen not so much what he professes but how he lives his life according to the word amen not one who's defeated not one who's negative amen hallelujah turn to your neighbor and say stop being negative you see the other person didn't want to look at you because they don't want you to talk to them they want you to look at each other dead in the eye now sister brother Kenzo sister Jason wants to look at you there tell them again stop being negative being the word is power positive so we must be positive amen hallelujah there in lies most of our problems we only speak our problems this is not going right that is not going right this is wrong that is wrong nothing is ever right the only time you think something is right is when you are [Music] wrong amen hallelujah praise the Lord now there's one character that we can pattern our elves after and that's our Lord Jesus Christ amen is the only character given to man because all characters that flaws in the Bible That's why God could never fully Express himself through that man no matter how great the prophet was or prophets down through the Bible no matter how great the man was God couldn't fully Express himself through that man therefore he had to create a perfect body and express himself through Jesus Christ so we've come down through seven Church ages and God couldn't find a woman that he could perfectly Express himself through so he he selected a certain class of people that would receive the entire message under Malachi Chap 4:5 and under Revelation 10:7 who had identified the Luke 17:30 sign that this woman would be a woman that I can express myself through amen she will be the Eve that will confound the Earth that will confound Satan amen God couldn't do it through seven Church ages but he's found in end time people amen that are built upon all mysteries of God Amen I'm trying to show you what a special class of people you are don't get afraid of the power that's God going to unleash upon you amen don't don't be afraid also because God just won't dump his power on people with unbelief yeah amen we've got to looking for people of Faith amen therefore we are not looking for big numbers but we are looking for the quality of people that can take the word of God and handle it there amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so if we want to look for character we look at the Lord Jesus Christ because we shouldn't have any natural man that we look up to because all men have flaws amen hallelujah yeah the prophet of God says look at his character watch his ministry as he worked then he works now as he was then he is now and will be forever and just what he did in them days he's doing it today he's just the same yesterday today and forever same time type of character amen he says a man that professes to be a Christian must have Christlike nature if it isn't there's another nature there which isn't Christlike amen he says if you're an if you're a killer if I told you at the Spirit of John Dillinger some famous Outlaw you'd expect me to have guns you'd you'd be dangerous to be sitting around where I was at cuz I'd be a murderer amen if I told you had the spirit of some famous mechanic you'd expect me to know what was wrong with your car if I looked at it if I told you the spirit of Christ was in me I must act like Christ you must act like Jesus your character and conduct must be molded like that and the Holy Spirit molds that conduct when he comes into you when you're really born again of the spirit of God there's the key now a man born in sin shaped in iniquity how does God equip him with the right kind of character the key is the Holy Ghost GH I'll say it again too many people are afraid of the Holy Ghost too many people want to make the Rapture without the Holy Ghost and that won't work there's no Rapture for you without the Holy Ghost you can say you believe all the word of God that's revealed through this Prophet but if you don't have the Holy Ghost there's no Rapture for you yes amen we find when a person is born growing up in life the things he reads the company he Associates with starts to mold the character of the person starts to influence the person amen the prophet of God is talking about Abraham Lincoln and he showing you how books can mold your character books can mold your character he says the only books we believe that Lincoln ever had until he was 21 years old was the Bible and the fox's book of mar that's what molded that character let me see what you read yeah let me go into your office amen are you going down this Lane again you like to come into my house every time Holy Spirit thou are welcome in this place I'm not too concerned what goes on in your house I just want you to make the Rapture amen hallelujah that's what I'm designed for Amen to build Faith within you to take a Rapture if I not a faith preacher amen preaching rapturing Faith to you I'm wasting my time I'm not sure to present theological sermons about some great mystery I'm here to prepare you for the Rapture amen amen hallelujah yes Lord let me see what you read let me go into your office in your house see what you read I will tell you what you are and you keep the Bible laying close to your children read it yourself amen be an example amen that's what I didn't have in my younger life the prophet is saying but by God's grace I want to put that before my children and if there is another generation may they put it before theirs and now if we could think today amen hallelujah so we know the Bible is a certain sound not an uncertain sound it identifies the characteristics of God in its sounding amen now what are the characteristics of God you are the characteristics of God God is expressing himself through you amen amen God's love can be expressed through you God's compassion can be expressed through you amen amen yeah we find here Jesus is saying in St John 37 10:37 if I do not the works of my father now watch are the prop is rephrasing it if I do not the works of my father and I don't have the character of my father then don't believe me they are the one they identify his character in me his characteristics and the characteristics of God is displayed by his promise for that age so the promise for this age after Revelation 10:7 is revelation 108-111 of people who are coming back in the image and likeness of God Amen who have dominion over the Earth so you are the characteristic of God being expressed on the earth amen hallelujah how did he do it yeah the prophet now I want you to follow this amen don't let it be tedious now I need you to Rejoice over the truth amen because maybe you haven't been this way before and maybe you need to go this way because maybe you don't know how to operate in this power and how to attain the character basically we are telling you now how to operate in the character and what are the basic steps that you [Music] need amen amen the gospel comes with progression we can't bypass any of the steps amen so it may sound tedious this morning but if we want to attain the characteristic of God the character of God the character amen hallelujah with power that is foot to rule these are the steps we need to take amen amen hallelujah so the New Testament we know is a New Covenant amen and the Lamb of God was slain and his blood in his blood was the life that has come upon us so the blood has life amen the prophet says blood is life in the New Testament life is from the blood of the Lamb which means New Testament New Covenant now the prophecy was after those days I will write my laws upon the fleshly tables of their heart amen amen the spirit Covenant will I make with the people and it displays his power here John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also shows that Jesus has met every requirement for us that God is required to make us back truly Sons and Daughters of God under the blood where there is no more condemnation amen amen yes you see this is key because some people can't get out from condemnation their past troubles them all the life yes amen because Satan uses the spirit which is as memory yes hello Satan uses a spirit which has memory and conscience and reasoning and affection and Imagination Satan uses a spirit to remind you of your past and what does it do it cripples Faith yes and it attracts fear amen but we've got to know there is power amen power Wonder workking power in the Precious Blood of the lamb and it cleanses me from all sin it cleanses me from every evil amen all of my past amen I am now a clean pure virgin Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I stand sinless before his presence why because of the blood the life that was in the blood has come upon me and what is he doing building me up amen amen therefore Romans 8:1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen amen see not those who are believing [Music] it brother sister I want to remind you the blood of Jesus cleanses you from all sin amen all condemnation amen you must be born again you can live in the Glorious victory of the Lord Jesus Christ if you submit yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah not believing it but those who are in Christ walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen no condemnation free from sin free from cares of the world no condemnation amen what is it doing the god of Heaven has accepted you his life is in you you are Sons and Daughters of God Amen if a dog has a Offspring what is it a dog I'm trying to remind you again if you are a son and daughter of God the caliber you are if for monkey has a Offspring what is it if God you're a son and daughter of God what are you amen son and amen hallelujah Lord praise the Lord you see the blood was applied and his life could not come upon the believer then for the life of the animal amen hallelujah now watch this is very important because Watch What Happens now when you accept the blood of Jesus everybody wave your hand to me amen I'm doing this for a purpose amen because this teaching can get a bit tedious right now and you can fall asleep but I want you to see what comes upon you and what it makes you I want you to understand you are not ordinary yes yes listen when the blood the life comes upon you watch what it does to you now see instead of being of a human being it was a super super super human being amen you see what you become yes and that makes the human being now not only a human being but he's a son and daughter of God of the super super super super super life amen how many times super amen you're a Superman you're a Super Woman you have super life but what is it Satan doesn't want you to understand that you have superpow am oh thank you Lord look at what the blood does but that's why I say this Revelation is kept away from the people to make them think I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ but you know hey yesterday I did this wrong the other day I did this wrong I'm living under condemnation I'm living under fear you got to be bold you got to have a character like Christ you've got to accept all the promises of God I don't know if you know now that what I'm trying to tell you is that you've got to confess this with your mouth that all my sins have been cleansed washed away if you confess with your mouth believe it in your heart yes amen hallelujah yes praise the Lord instead of a human being it was a super super super human being and that makes the human being now not only a human being but is a son and daughter of God of the super super super super Faith Life that was in him comes back upon who somebody say me me amen super life comes upon you how many times super five times super that's Grace am super Grace life comes upon me amen amen super Grace life how many of you have got super Grace life amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord amen you keep receiving there brother Caleb some of you are sleeping in the service here brother Caleb is receiving his promises amen hallelujah he found me so excited On th was it Thursday you found me amen we were speaking about our believing God to cancel your debt credit cards and all of these things see you're not coming here you're not receiving because such as I have give I am to the that's why some of you sitting with huge credit card debts and in problems and you're not coming to service so when the preacher is giving you say you can give it to me yes amen the prophet only gave one example when he said brother my crops are burning out there I have need of rain maybe your bank balance is burning and you don't know how to pay it and what did the prophet says you will tell that brother I give it to you amen he says I give you rain amen amen so I was telling you under Inspirations preaching here on Wednesday about how the Lord can cancel your credit card debt because the same power that he's able to heal you he's able to meet every one of your other needs he's not only Jehovah Rafa I mean he not only Jehovah Rafa means Jehovah healer he's Jehovah Gyra amen you see we've been taught to believe only God for healing but he's Jehovah Gyra and you can get the testimony from Caleb how when he went home or was the same day or next day same day he went home to check his app and you see money came into his card to pay off his credit card no no no some of you didn't get that you know why you jealous now how come it didn't happen to me now but it only happens to the one who connects with it amen so if you want super super super super Grace life connect with it because that's what it does amen amen yeah brother Joshua was sharing his testimony with you he was fearful because the bull was coming up and his wife was being like more than a conqueror there loading stuff into the trolley amen that's why I don't take my wife shopping with me amen hallelujah I don't like to get angry you know hey but the shopping chps can make you angry amen hallelujah you know especially I know some of you got disc yo amen but operating under God's economy you see Wednesday we were telling you about the economy within an economy amen so even though the barrel of meal and the cruise of oil was down to its last one where the woman can only bake one cake she was going to die she even was prepared to die she even was telling everyone I'm going to die that was the economy of Israel at the time but then she lock into God's economy which is a greater economy and was able to sustain it for how long three and a half years while the rest of the people were starving that's right while inflation was going through the roof how many of you want to live under God's economy oh yes amen Sons and Daughters of God who have super super super super super life imagine if we write a song like that how we going to sing that super super super super super life has now come upon me he you see I'm not living in the economy of ramapa I'm living in my father's economy amen people don't take terms and conditions around me amen I know I am a Son of God I can speak things I can speak my business to progress I can speak customers you see some of you are receiving right now I can speak my customer base I can speak amen employment I can speak contracts I can speak those things amen why I've connected with another Elijah of this day thank you Lord hallelujah thank you Lord that woman connected with one Elijah we have connected with the F with this fourth Elijah amen amen amen for all the unbelievers go on just believing Amen brother Caleb will keep rejoicing I don't know if he's going to find more money when he goes home tonight the way he's rejoicing amen praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah amen you see you need to make good Investments you speak to brother Caleb brother Jeffer they probably will tell you about good Investments but there's no greater investment than the gospel it will make your family life Prosper it will make your financial life Prosper amen it'll make your work life Prosper it's one best investment yes amen amen hallelujah you see he says here comes back upon you and changes you from a sinner and things of the world a church member denominational goer to a born again Christian filled with the spirit the life of God just flowing from you like Sparks from an anvil you just walk full of virtue love gentleness see what character this is now you're full of virtue full of love gentleness as the Holy Spirit moving speaking there you are and with what hearing the message watching the pillar of fire and the Blessed Assurance have passed from Death unto life no condemnation at all you see we need to ask one another ask the devil what sin what sin you're talking about it was gone the very minute I've confessed you know some of us have come through the blood being born again baptized and all of these things we keep going back Lord forgive me Lord for my past forgive me for my past the Lord put it in the sea of forgetfulness he saying what's talking about amen oh yes amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen yeah in perfect strength by Perfect weakness that's the way God wants us realize that we are totally insufficient then God takes that person and and begins to mold himself into that person make his hands do what God would have his hands do make his lips speak what God's lips would speak because they're not is they're Gods he begins to build a character begins to take this weakness and make his own [Music] self thank Lord God wants to make himself in you yes you haven't seen the most powerful version of rames yet you haven't seen the most powerful version of of Joshua or Caleb or Jeff the most powerful version of you is the Holy Ghost fill version one that is totally submitted to the holy spirit amen amen hallelujah amen yes amen thank you Lord you see when Faith turn super thank you Lord you know how to turn faith super when Divine love projects it turns Faith super super Faith super anointing am amen hallelujah you know that's the key if you read 1 Corinthians 13 because even there the Apostle Paul is saying though I had power to speak to mountains and have not love yes right but let's flip it around and not focus on the negative what if you spoke to the mountain in love amen what if you spoke to your situations your problems and all of your things with love amen yes what if you applied love to everything amen praise the Lord thank you Lord amen so unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain the reason for that is character simply is never made without suffering some of you brothers and sisters sitting here have been through suffering in your life you've suffered because you've just been under the the weight of sin you've allowed Satan Amen to influence your mind but God is molding character through that suffering right character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule you see it to operate Mark 11:23 the power you've got to have the character to be able to be foot to rule what do you think all creation is groaning for waiting to see your character yes the God man yes amen sir amen so don't be a faithless character amen be a perfect man a man of character that has the nature of Christ amen that's something you and I can't manufacture it takes the Holy Spirit to produce the Life of Christ amen amen now think about this there are many good moral men on the Earth right we may know some of them some of them you may say oh what a wonderful man this is what a wonderful lady this is they have such great morals good character but that's not what we're talking about these people do good deeds they go on feeding schemes they feed the poor they clothe the the amen those that need clothing real good people amen charitable but that's not the character we are talking about alone yes we must do good deeds yes we must feed the hungry yes we must clothe them that don't have clothes amen hallelujah but good deeds alone don't cut it we are talking amen because the man born of the flesh can't inherit the kingdom of God flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God Amen so matter no matter how good and decent and moral the person is if they are not born again they cannot attain eternal life we must be born so what is the kingdom of God the Holy Spirit how many of you can identify with that the kingdom of God is the holy spirit that's why Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you if you got the holy Spirit within you the kingdom of God is within you amen praise the Lord so we must be born again of water and of spirit that's the Holy Ghost within us begins to build the character of Christ amen the character that God is pleased with amen our best human efforts won't cut it unless become God's provided way amen so we just read a quote now about character being a victory if character is a victory not a gift means that we must overcome our human character yes to be victorious how do we overcome we must die to ourselves amen how many of you know that the most selfish people is the one you're looking at now the one I'm looking at now let me start looking at everyone here quickly the Bible says lovers of Self in the last days he High minded lovers of pleasure more than the lovers of God you see Enemy Number One is where yeah me I am Enemy Number One to myself amen so don't tell me I'm your enemy number one you have to wait in line I can only be number two to you because I am Enemy Number One to myself you can't come to me and accuse me and say you're my number one enemy you have to take number two spot because number one is me to me the one that is restricting the power of God in my life is me you see we've got to take responsibility amen we can't pass blame to the next person yes amen the one that is stopping me to be used to my full potential is me and I must die to myself and I Must Die daily amen amen hallelujah that's why we sing Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me amen amen praise the Lord thank you Lord so the character of Christ is the character of Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness amen I'm if you know where the scripture is found second Peter amen amen you want to read it I know some of you don't read your Bibles amen so let's read it so you know where it's found second Peter chapter 1 in verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and pre precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so there's a divine nature that must be attained and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make that you shall be neither Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack these things is blind and cannot see a far off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sin wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall am for so shall an entrance be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so I don't need to say anything more that's how you get into the kingdom into the Rapture the key is there you'll never find any denomination preaching on the scripture you tell me one time show me T J's preaching on this scripture show me jool team preaching on the scripture go find any other Church preaching on the scripture but it's the entrance to Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ why it's the character it's the life amen yes so what is the character the faith required to operate the third pole Mark 16 Mark 11:23 the faith of God so God's not going to dump his power onto you if you don't have the character required to operate faith God is telling us us to have the faith of God if you read Mark 11 20 how it starts he says have faith in God if you go and tap into that scripture you'll find it says have the faith of God Amen so it's not our own human Faith it's the faith of God in us and God in his people makes us a super sign it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me amen so how God is going to present mold our character through trials yes through test so that's why the Apostle Paul says rejoice when these trials come upon you because father is molding you and shaping you amen a test is not to make you fall test is there to make you promote you to the next grade amen so each test we overcome we must pass in order to progress to the next level God worked with Moses this way amen God worked with Moses when he passed the first test he gave him moved him to the next level amen so God is patient with us aren't you glad we have a patient [Music] Lord he's working on us until we cooperate with his plan until we develop the character required amen it's the hardest thing for us to do is get ourselves out of the way so that God can work through us because we want to use our own human ability and that's not what God required God requires full obedience to his word so God is developing his character through his word and if we don't read the word our character can't be developed this is the sword that's shaping us molding us amen amen how many of you pledge to read the word of God amen amen read the word of God say Lord this is what you're using to mole me this is what you're using to shape me know you're saying we have the opening of the word amen our hearts have been been turned back but then the word is in our hand and we don't use it this is the opening of the word amen right here amen hallelujah so God is developing our character through the word because the word is a Heavenly word listen to this now the word is an Heavenly word amen amen hallelujah that's why the Bible says be not conformed to this world but be this word came from a Heavenly realm so we are conforming oursel to the Heavenly realm why we are preparing to leave Earth and go into heaven then we don't require another character if the Bible is giving us the character to live on Earth it's the same character we can take and go to heaven amen because the word came from heaven we don't need a a change of character when we go to heaven if we conform to the character of the word on the earth how many if you get what I'm saying the same word amen is effective on the earth and in heaven so I'm saying if you allow your character to be molded here on the earth it's the same character you can use to liveing Heaven because the same word shaped it you don't need another change of character to go into heav amen that's why we must conform to the character of God Amen praise the Lord amen the character to rule with dominion and Authority amen is in the word the character to rule and reign with authorities in the word but we don't take the word and apply it amen the word is developing us and making us candidates to live in heaven because the word of God transcends the earth into the heavenlies now you know that God worked with br brother Brandon in that way through his experiences he molded his character the way that God wanted to demonstrate his power through him through the first two pools of his ministry was the training ground that would eventually lead to the third pool but God had to correct him when he was going through the training of the first two pools and he told him he tried to explain the gift too much and he showed him the shoelaces which were all now in a mess you remember that M and then he told him because of this you cause kindly impersonations Oral Roberts came up on the scene a Allan all of these men kind impersonations because you explain the gift too much even now if you study the prophet's messages under that first and second po you can find Keys how to operate under the anointing because he explained it so much if you go on YouTube you'll find how brandom influenced my life talking about these Apostolic people on the Earth call themselves prophets they put YouTube videos out how brandom influenced my life how they begin to study his early sermons and learn to operate under the anointing I'm not talking about long ago go go Google it yourself and see few months ago they've been putting these things up why he explained the gift he explained how to operate in the anointing amen hallelujah now you remember the character that was required to pray for the baby that was sick remember the time now the tax man phoned he stepped out of the house and he said tell him I'm not home amen what happened the Holy Spirit would not move so you can see the character required to operate the power amen so even though he he may have tried to pray for the baby he had to go back and see the taxi man make that thing right and say you know what when you found I was at home but I stepped out of the door and I told my wife to tell you I'm not at home that man told Brother brandom I had a lot of confidence in you but I have even more confidence in you now amen what am i showing you the character required for the power of God to operate in your life so you can't leave these little things undone yes amen hallelujah amen we've got to learn how to submit under the authority of God yes [Music] think about how his character was molded when he listened to his mother-in-law and didn't go and preach to the Pentecostal people down there he it was a hard price to pay but what was God doing molding and shaping his character so that he would be able to submit to the Holy Spirit you remember when he came to Durban South Africa when he came to South Africa and the angel of God told him go to Durban and he listened to a bunch of ministers and he said I had to pay a price for it he had that stomach trouble after them because he refused to listen and heed the voice of the angel of God Amen you remember that Amen in coincidentally brother Rosco was mentioning this amen because he he said he had some fellowship with brother Billy Paul and he asked him how come you know were able to see the angel of God he said this is what it was this is now according to him and his conversation with Bly Paul that the reason why he was selected to see the angel of God when brother Bram was listening to those men and you know they were changing his schedule and the angel told him come to deran he says but the bully Paul told his dad dad why do we need to listen to these men yeah why don't we follow the leading of the angel of God and and this is believe Paul's testimony he says because I made that statement the angel of God was pleased with me amen and therefore he allowed me to see him amen so don't think the angel of God is not listening to our conversations when we choose to accept right when we choose to stay with the word of God amen amen praise the Lord amen so think of what a price he had to pay amen it's 11:23 right now amen we're going to close in a few minutes for those of you who think that amen we're going too long I'm not preaching long amen you are just [Music] bored amen praise the Lord so what is the character required I'm trying to show you how God will take you through our trials think of it he lost his child he lost his daughter he ended up with a stomach trouble because he didn't obey his the angel of God who said come to deran amen why deran why deran specifically amen I don't know if you caught the revelation of it but because of me amen the angel of God had a special place in his heart and still has a special place in his heart for Duran South Africa amen hallelujah in fact if you meet the angel of God ask him where is his favorite place he'll tell you der in South Africa you ask him who's his favorite person he'll tell you me amen and I'm sure if I ask him who's his favorite person to tell me you but that's what we got to believe why we welcome his presence amen hallelujah amen so look at the Hard trials yet to go look if you look in your own life look at the Hard experiences you've been through but God has called you back to him God is calling you back amen hallelujah sometimes it may seem like the pain of life is too hard the trial is too hard but look at the prophet's Journey you can make it you can overcome amen allow the Holy Spirit say Lord I'm submitting to your Holy Spirit Lord I've tried it my own way Lord I've tried my own life living my own life doing things my own way but I'm surrendering to you Lord Jesus I'm surrendering everything to you I'm surrendering my marriage I'm surrendering my finances I'm surrendering my children I'm surrendering my work I'm surrendering everything to you Lord Jesus Jesus and I'm asking you to take control of everything amen hand it over to Jesus am amen hallelujah praise the Lord remember he wants to mold and shape us amen God is trying to achieve in US amen hallelujah no matter how great the test he's molding our character he is the Potter we are just the clay so even in death when brother brandham couldn't understand and maybe in death in our own lives we don't understand we don't have the answer answer God is in perfect control ours is not to question why ours amen God will not give us more than we can bear but with the test will make a way of Escape ours is not to go into depression anxiety stress and worry amen you remember everything that a seed requires to grow to its full potential is within the seed a farmer can't add to the seed he's got to take the seed planted in the ground and Trust the process amen so it by faith that tree will eventually grow and produce fruits amen no manmade interference now the seed of God is within you everything that you require in this life to overcome this life is within you all the potentials is within you you've just got to swow yourself into the word of God die to ourselves let the tree grow amen and we will bring forth much fruit amen amen hallelujah amen stop looking through the eyes of Flesh start Looking Through The Eyes Of God start looking at stop looking at your zero bank balance and look through God's bank balance say my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills he will not suffer the righteous yes to go begging for bread amen I've never seen the righteous forsaken no he he begging for bread say Lord I The Chosen seed of God I will not beg for bread Lord you are my father you are my provider I'm trusting you to come in on the seene now and provide for me amen Trust the process amen so what are we doing we are coming to the climax of this age where Sons and Daughters of God are coming into manifestation sons of God are coming to sunship Authority amen we are answering Creations grown we are coming back to the position we lost in the Garden of Eden in the beginning amen this is the end of all things and at the end of all things all that was lost in Eden is regain all that Adam lost we gained through Christ amen you remember when brother brand was faced with a disrespectful couple what was his character he said he could have cursed them but his character was developed to such a place that he could love them and what was his words I forgive you so now when somebody comes against you and speaks words against you and you feel they attacking you do you need to respond in a negative way or can you say now I forgive you amen amen we were speaking about how we a god of multiplication now God also wants us to forgive in multiplication am he says how many times must I forgive 70 times 7 amen he didn't tell you you forgive like this 70 minus 1 first time second time they offend you 70 minus 2 did God say he must forgive like that God says forgive in multiplication forgive 70 * 7 if I'm blessing you in abundance then you also forgive in abundance amen amen that's father's Kingdom his economy that's how it works amen hallelujah am so it wasn't in only that scene he said I forgive you to that couple you remember that amen hallelujah what was that doing when he was faced with a raging bll in the field amen that experience was to mold his character at first he tried to reach for his gun amen but when he realized that his own human potential couldn't handle the situation his gun was not there his gun was in the glove compartment what happened he had to rely on God God was training him not to rely on human ability so he began to love the Raging Bull amen hallelujah the same situation with the flying bees the on its nest when he's mowing the lawn yes Divine love projects he speaks to the bees so he has a man a man back in the image and likeness of God Amen a man who could speak to the winds and the waves did he not speak to the uh in the storm he spoke the wind and the W and this amen wind the storm out of existence did he speak to Flying bees did he speak to the Raging Bull yes amen who is this man in the image of God again praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah when his wife made him angry or sorry when he his wife got angry with him and slam the door because he would not correct Joseph it led her to developing a cyst that required surgery and did he go to and say yeah woman you see now you speak to me you see you got big mouth see now you got sist now I told the doctor when they cut you must give you anesthetic did he try and approach in carel what did he do he he projected love he even prayed for his wife now wives please don't take advantage of this amen hallelujah amen I'm just trying to show you the different character developments the prophet went through and now we use love to overcome every circumstance amen hallelujah so the the character required to possess all that God has given you is to have a Fearless faithful character not a fearful one amen hallelujah amen I need to close now amen praise the Lord let me close with this what's happening now in natural Israel amamas what was the last invasion they were blowing up underground tunnels were they blowing up underground tunnels what are those secret passages where within the land of Israel now with within you the Holy Spirit wants to blow up all tunnels amen all tunnels of unbelief amen hallelujah there's a beautiful type that's happening there right now amen hallelujah I think they're in a ceasefire at the moment amen were they in a ceasefire yes and they were going to swap hostages how many hostages 50 you got it 50 types Pentecost because in spiritual Israel some are denying Pentecost some of you need to get this now amen listen to what I'm telling you natural type spiritual in spiritual Israel some are denying the Pentecostal experience but yet natural Israel is saying we want 50 50 is a type of they want back the Pentecostal experience I see you're still catching it but you take it slow you'll catch it right that's a type in the Bible because you remember when a after the rain and aab was looking for this k for Elijah got it right so for those of you who don't know the word Elijah connected with this man who hit 50 men in a cave so there's a group of people people within the Messi church that have hidden the Pentecostal experience and not caused it to die out amen and he hit 50 prophets in a cave because who wanted to slay the prophets Jezebel but the Pentecostal experience was hidden yes and after the rain came back the prophets were released out of the cave mean the Pentecostal blessing came back upon the people amen so I'm telling you natural Israel right now they're demanding 50 hostages to come back they are trying to show us in time the Pentecostal experience coming back to the church amen yes Lord amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord how you reading style how are you reading the news amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen oh there's so much to read amen but amen maybe we'll just leave it there maybe we'll just read this final quote Amen in statue of perfect man praise the Lord because remember we're speaking about character with power is's foot to rule and there's a certain type of character going in the Rapture you got the last one yeah that's the one he says but each age God has placed these things into the church what is he talking about faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness amen charity God placed these things into the church and patented by showing that each individual has these possesses these qualities and this being when it's completed is the Church of God going in the Rapture amen no other church is going in the Rapture but the one in the image and likeness of Christ the one who possesses these seven steps to Perfection am and this
