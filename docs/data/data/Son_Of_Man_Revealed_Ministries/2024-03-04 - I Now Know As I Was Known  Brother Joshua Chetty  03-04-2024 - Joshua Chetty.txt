God we appreciate when God sends us gifts amen and we we thank God that we belong to an assembly where we even now the set men of the hour the the gift that God has given us have allowed us to have a teachable spirit have allowed us to appreciate the fivefold ministry amen amen you see you you because you are taught in a certain way and therefore when you go and you hear from the 54 Ministry you know how to eat amen you know how to partake but you're also not eating as someone that was in famine now you hear what I'm saying now amen now when someone is starving they begin to they they eat fast and when they eat fast they don't digest the food properly the food don't go in well it doesn't sit well but if you a person that have a good balanced diet oh yes and then you're eating your food digest well am amen and then you have proper nourishment and then you grow like how you grow naturally you're growing yes spiritually amen so because you are fed well you go and when you eat from the fivefold ministry your your diet is balanced and you have spiritual nourishment so appreciate what God is doing appreciate the five4 ministry and appreciate the gift that God has given unto us amen so we go tonight to our Bibles uh we'll take from 1 Corinthians 13 verse 9 let me just read it from here for we know in part and we prophesy in part yes but but when that which is perfect is come amen then that which is in part shall be done away amen when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man yes amen we believe we reach maturity in this hour amen amen amen we had to start our work with justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the the the Christian walk is a progressive walk amen but now when you become a man I put away childish things amen amen so it's not just about coming to I'm just a Christian I have to go to church I have to have a long hair I have to have a long dress I have to have church order not just that anymore for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face amen face to face that means the word is in front of you the angel of God appear to you amenah now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known amen amen so you are known amen and the only person that knows you is God and the only person that going to show you your true identity is God himself hallelujah amen Psalms 139 1-4 says Psalm chapter 139 reading from verse 1 to4 it says oh Lord thou has searched me and known me amen thou knowest my Downs sitting and my Uprising thou understanded my thought a far off you see when he went on Calvary he knew all things even before the foundation of the world before you can be manifested on the earth in you your whole life thou compassed me my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways amen therefore we have to always acknowledge the presence of God Amen he knows all things amen for there is not a word in my tongue but L Lord thou knowest it all together whatever you speak in your closet whatever you speak in secret God knows it all Hallelujah so that is why you have to always be conscient of presence but if you got the Holy Ghost even if you thought the wrong thoughts even if you spoke the wrong thing the Holy Ghost there to navate your life bring you back to correction through his word amen amen Let's uh thank God for the reading of his word you may be seated just read a quote quickly the prophet of God in question and answers 64 he says it is referring to 1 Corinthians 133 says when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things which when that which is perfect yes and do we have today and sorry and we do have today by God's help yes the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication amen no other age was the word perfectly interpret interpreted with Divine Vindication as in this age amen we not waiting for another interpretation of the word because there's already been a perfect interpretation of the word and therefore the true five4 Ministry is going to take the same word yes amen they're not going to interpret it in another way they're going to make sense to it in other words they're going to bring that word in a present condition amen for the present time for a present people amen amen then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things amen I go to preaching and then didn't okay speaking about these things so what he saying we have the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication so in other words what you have is not a message for childish people yes amen remember the prophet done the ABCs but he was waiting for the message amen the message was for the people that will already come getting ready for the edstone amen they've already buils when now the mind of Christ can come in them amen amen now you can't have the mind of Christ until it comes to the adoption age because the mind of Christ has to come to a mature people amen amen that will understand mature things there was a time when Jesus was on the earth under the first two pools doing Mighty miracles signs and wonders feeding the multitude and so forth but then he come when he comes down he's opening the word these things are only revealed to his inner circle yes to his disciples amen it wasn't for everybody amen so these things are revealed to God's predestinated people amen them that were part of him before the foundations of the world right this is not a public show amen yes amen yes it's spoken in public the message is gone around the world yes but it's not the revelation of it yes amen amen the understanding of it is not for everybody am the plain language of it which is in such Simplicity is not for the whole world Amen it's only for the predestinated yes so he's speaking on a little thought this evening I I now know even as I have been fully known yes amen I now know there was a time we didn't know as we have been fully known but there's a season when the angel of the Lord must come to you yes and fully reveal yourself your part of the scripture amen amen amen there was a season when we had to see that God sent us a prophet there was a season we had to identify what Malachi 4 and 5 came to do yes but now is a season for what you are meant to do amen amen now is a season to understand your scripture because you cannot walk in perfect Faith unless you see yourself in the scripture amen amen and Perfection can only come through Oneness amen you know what I'm saying Perfection comes in other words you have to become one with the word so he's saying we speaking on I now know even as I've been fully known amen cuz God deals with us through election amen God that's how God has always been dealing with things when God chose Israel in the natural he dealt with them through election when he chose Abraham when he was dwelling in the land of the the Chans down there in Babylon he chose him by election when he chose Jacob in the womb he wases by election amen and everything God does he chooses by election that's how he shows his love to us amen amen and we out of this message out of the the The Awakening out of the the word coming to awaken us to take us out of spiritual Amnesia we just thought we were just Christians or some whatever wherever we were and even when we come in the message we just thought yes God sent a prophet he brought proper Church order and doctr which is different from all the other churches which is that's how a Christian Life should be which is sweet because everything is with the Bible this property showing us woman shouldn't preach and all these things these are all in line with scripture that is beautiful and that is sweet and it was good for the season because God word called for a total separation from unbelief yes amen so they had to be cleaning up from out of Egypt amen amen but before entering the Land There have to come circumcision again amen for many were born in the wilderness and not born in Egypt yes there had to come another time where Joshua had to get them circumcised to enter the land amen and what the Holy Ghost you're not entering the land amen and the Holy Ghost is not a fancy subjects I'm talking about the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost dwelling in you is not a popular subject am not a popular subject in modern times that we are living in because the Holy Ghost come to the same oldfashioned gospel amen the Holy Ghost hasn't changed his ways the Holy Ghost still ate sin the Holy Ghost is still holy the Holy Ghost still requires only clean lives the Holy Ghost still require consecrated lives amen the pattern is always the same the Holy Ghost still calls you to be an ODOT ball he still calls for a separation from unbelief amen amen he still wants us to separate from the things of the world am because he wants to show you you see the devil keeps wants to remind you that you belong to Mr and Mrs so and so still remind you you come from the chti family you come from the Naidu family you come from the governor family amen he still wants to remind you of that you are in that family born in poverty you are the family you had a bad name the that's what the devil wants to do yes but the Holy Ghost wants to remind you you are no longer the son of Charles and Ella Bram you are a son and daughter of God the word has come to make you known as you was known as you are fully known amen it's like that like that slave out there from Africa he was a slave but what made him different from everybody else oh yes he ate the same food like everybody else slept in the same place like everybody else we are like everyone else in terms of that we are trapped in the P house we are living in this world like everyone else we are facing the same Spirits like everybody else we not immune to those things we are facing the same Lan Spirits like everybody else but what makes us different we recognize our identity amen the word has come down to awaken us to our true identity that you are Eternal beings that you are Spirit beings trapped in a flesh body hallelujah amen you're not a you're not a human body with a spirit in it you are a spirit being trapped In the Flesh body therefore you can defy the natural that's the the you can defy Supernatural defy things of world like sicknesses and so forth how do you do that you don't deal with them through your five senses if you are a supernatural being you deal with it supernaturally you recognize Spirits amen you got people with oppression around you you deal with it supernaturally yes you got people with demon spirits around you deal with it supernaturally amen amen so the devil wants to always hold you in the flesh he wants to always remind you of your failures in the flesh he doesn't want to make you think about what God did for you he doesn't want you to remember he doesn't want you to have this revelation of who you truly are yes because when you get the revelation of who you truly are you'll become an invincible Army he was preventing you all these years from becoming to Super church he was preventing you from becoming the super race because why he made you focus on the flesh yeah that's why you find in your life sometimes you get over the devil bring certain circumstances coming your life certain things come in your way all those trials and tribulations come in your life but you're going to come as a son and daughter of God in the hour where title leaders come down you're going to start to have dominion over every circumstance in your life have dominion over this Earth First you want to have dominion over the rest of the thing start having dominion over this HS amen because you need to get the Revelation as you are fully known that now you are that temple of God Amen the temple of God was there in the days Solomon build the temple the sh Glory came down in the temple then the temple came it was Jesus Christ and then now where is that Temple amen that Temple is this body of Christ amen amen so recognize yourself that you are the temple of God you you are the place that God dwells in right now yes you are the house that he dwells in amen yes but the devil wants to make you feel you are natural man and woman but I tell you something with that word when that light began to strike that seed within you he couldn't stop that amen amen no matter which system you was in when light began to strike that seed you began to realize no I'm Different something made you think I'm a different person yes there's something made you see I'm not like everybody else I need something more amen I need something more yes and then the word came your way amen and you began to see this is what you needed all the time but now you was growing from Faith unto Faith from Glory unto glory amen but now you living in a season of entering the land it's time to now have possession amen and the word of God the teaching of Ministry comes to place you in the land amen which is the Holy Ghost it comes to place you in your rightful place yes amen and if you are placed amen then you know what God want done with his word yes he know then you'll understand God's purpose for your life yes God's purpose for your life is not just to go to school go to uh College get a good job get a good business that's not God's purpose those things are there for you to get by in the Natural Life yes amen and wherever God plac you God is going to make you excel in it amen Daniel shedrach mishak and abono were taken into captivity from young boys it wasn't all men yes that's right but when they went there they never forsook the true Lord their God Amen they never forsook to pray to the Lord their God they never forsook his Commandments and all his law amen they kept the word and they excelled in their captivity Joseph he excelled where God put him every place amen Joseph for tread upon he excelled in it he prospered amen everything he touched prospered amen and you find that we are put here in this world wherever God put us we we are sons and Daughters of God Amen now God never put us here to have fear he never ask you to have fear over your Deb amen CU death will come from time to time sickness will come from time to time situations may happen in your life from time to time but he never put you there fear when you know who you are amen now when you know who you are what are natural things for you come on now you are a supernatural being you a being that can speak things amen amen we're living under the third pool amen yes amen we have the opening of the word not just any word yes we talking about title deed here amen because when the word open you began to see your name in the book yes and now when you and this is the hour when you saw when you saw that then you began to see yourself in the word amen and then you realize hey wait a minute this is me he's speaking about bride that's me he's speaking about Eagle that's me he's speaking about root that's my type he's speaking about Sarah that's my type he's speaking about all these things in a word is my type thou must prophesy again that is me he's showing John they come up a little higher that is me and you began to see that is you then you began to see that yes I was in the written word but now I am the manifested word I am the word made flesh in this hour what what said John John the Baptist apart when he was there on the earth he didn't go say I'm the son of so and so yes he identified I'm the one crying out in the wilderness amen prepare ye the way of the Lord he identified himself in the scripture when the the prophet came he identified himself with the scripture when Jesus was on Earth he took the word and he identified himself in the word so that's what sets you apart amen when you began to see that you are the word made flesh in this hour yes and then if you are the word made flesh in this our then the things that Jesus did you must do also because Christ is the mystery of God revealed and who is the mystery of Christ you and I yes we was the great mystery of Christ hidden in there all along when Christ was doing the Redemptive work you was all in God's plan when he did the Redemptive work yes amen yes from the beginning when he was doing the Redemptive work right there even when he SL slew the lamb and when he put Adam and Eve together it was always Christ and the bride it was always Christ and the bride in everything so everything that Christ did he had you in his thoughts you was the mystery behind it amen but now when you see yourself in the scripture is no longer a mystery amen because now it becomes reality yes it becomes the word made flesh it becomes it becomes now God again walking in 16 elements walking on our hands and feet but not in a one person Ministry anymore in a many membered body amen the Mystic IAL body of Jesus Christ the body that's from every nation from every tribe every tongue and every Kindred the prophet saw it in a vision amen yes amen and he saw his church so we began to see ourselves let's open to St John 10:3 St John chap 10 10:3 I and my father are one and then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him and Jesus answered them many good works have I showed you from my father for which of those Works do you Stone me the Jews answered him saying for a good work we stoned the not you see another words when you going to go out pray for the sick and they're going to receive healing they own persecute you for that they don't crucify you for that when you go and do good works speaking nice to things to them they w't do all that but see what it says here but for Blas for me and because that thou being a man make it thyself God yes you see it's hard for people to look Beyond the Veil and I'd be living that hour and now when you began to see I I am more than a normal human being yes amen I am Adam restored again yes I am a Son of God amen amen not a son and daughter of mortal beings but of an eternal God Amen yes Lord the creator of Life mother and father could produce a body but they couldn't produce the soul yes amen amen and I am in the image of God which is a spirit man amen God is a spirit amen therefore the true worshipers worship in spirit and in truth amen now what is the truth Jesus said if you love me you'll keep my word and my word will not be Grievious he said Thy word is truth amen he said I am the way the truth and the life amen now see when we as soon as we think about Jesus we all thinking back 2,000 years ago he said I am the way amen not I was the way he said I am the way the truth and the life so he's a present God Amen so he says but for bless for me because thou being a man maketh thyself God yes and I can tell you now people will expect they will respect you you got a nice Ministry praying for the sick people are getting healed and so forth but go and tell them according to scripture who you truly are tell them I'm the God man on the earth I'm an amateure God I am Mrs Jesus Christ amen I am I am the embodiment of the word made flesh now of Christ in in me Christ in me the hope of glory all that was in God he pour into Christ am all that was in Christ he poured into the church go tell them that and see if they don't tell you Blas me because thou being a man because why they are looking at you they're looking at the veil they're looking at the flesh body that you are trapped in they're not looking Beyond the Veil and therefore you know why people don't appreciate the why can't people can't appreciate the true word in the S people look at a monister preaching and they look at the veil they don't look Beyond the veil and say God in that man amen it's not the man that's speaking but God speaking through the man amen these things that we hearing is is not a man but God speaking through the man's voice vocals yes if you want to really appreciate God you got to look Beyond the Veil and understand God by his characteristics amen yes his characteristics are always the same so Jesus answered them said it is not written in your law I said ye are gods if you call them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken yes amen so let me ask you something now who is the word of the Lord coming to in this these days he's coming to the bride thou must prophesy again so who is the bride in this hour amen amateure Gods M Jesus Christ the body of Christ Christ is the head Christ as a body yes Christ as a body that was resurrected in his hour through the words amen yes when the seals were broken amen there was a resurrection amen of the body of Christ amen the body was laying dormant all this time the seals broke and the body came forth amen amen cuz it was a rising of the S so n amen he is the greater light she's the Lesser light she the Moonlight he is the sunlight amen am so the scripture cannot be broken see of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemist because I said I am the Son of God so now for you to identify yourself you are forsaking your Earthly fleshly things and you saying I am a son I am a daughter of God Amen you think it's easy for the people to grasp when you are saying I'm forsaking this flesh I am forsaking my worldly pleasures I'm forsaking the things of this world when you are saying I am I'm from another kingdom my kingdom does not operate like your kingdom amen amen I'm a citizen of another kingdom amen I'm a citizen of a kingdom that is eternal a citizen that can a kingdom that cannot perish in your kingdom you might have democracy in your kingdom you might you you might have your own rights to say what you want to say but in my kingdom my my God has his domain amen yes and he have subjects in his kingdom amen amen and he tell you subject you go there you go there you have this power you have this Authority you have that Authority that is my father's house amen and right now my father's business and I'm operating under my father's Authority in his kingdom from his kingdom you might be operating in this domain but this domain is temporary this domain is inferior to your kingdom amen because when he went on the other side he saw much more Superior things but one of these days there's going to be a renovation yes and he's going to become a superior Kingdom amen but right now this world has been weakened that's why the Bible says God will destroy them that destroy the world this Earth so you find that sin has weakened this Earth Satan has become the god of this evil age taking him 6,000 years to weaken the Earth you see when you see who you are then you begin to see other people around you you begin to see spirits in man when you begin to see that you are a spirit man dwelling in the flesh body then you begin to see Spirit dwelling in bodies yeah because then you have discernments because the spirit within you can discern the spirit within other people that have evil spirits in them and the evil spirits in them will discern the spirit in you the evil spirit wouldn't want to sit around you yeah I'm not talking when you stop talking fleshly things when you stop talking worldly things when you start talking like a son and daughter of God watch the evil spirits reacting yes amen amen you understand what I'm talking about amen start talking like your father amen start talking like Jesus he knew who he was he brought when he spoke he spoke with authority he was convinced of his own word so when you speaking the word you must be convinced of the word amen and he says but if I do do ye believe me not believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I am I in him so even though they can't understand what you're saying but they must see the manifestation yes they must see The Works in you they must see Christ again amen if we saying we have Christ then they must are you identify Christ Is In You by his characteristics he's the same yesterday today and forever amen we cannot keep saying Christ Hebrews 138 Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so we Pro professing to be Sons and Daughters of God then they must believe the works that is being done to us but if there's no Works being done then there's something wrong with our confession amen then we need to reevaluate what we confessing or unless we not even confessing you get what I'm saying because if you got confidence you'll confess yes you'll confess that you are a Christian amen you will not be ashamed to be a Christian no matter where you are no matter which you belong to you'll not be ashamed to identify yourself as a Christian you'll not be identified to not be ashamed to identify listen I'm not like your normal people I'm not like every other human being there's something different about me amen but let them see the difference in your life amen let them see the way you speak let them understand why you have this hope in a time when there's no hope you know we living such a time people have no hope anymore you have conversations around you everyone is negative negative about every situation whether it's their work whether it's politics whether it's their family whether it's their marriages whether it's whatever topic you can think about everything is negative because why Christ was put out of this world they rejected Christ when he come in this day Christ the hope of glory was rejected so when everyone is negative let them see why you have this hope amen let them see why you have this Joy let them see why you have this peace because the peace that Christ gives you no man can give you amen he can give you unspeakable joy he can give you peace that surpasses all understanding surpasses all human understanding John 14:18 says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also ask yourself if we can see him in this hour and we can see the things that we are doing so what does it mean he said I will not leave you comfortless amen yet the world can't see him can the world see what has happened can the world see that the Rapture has begun can the world see the shout went forth can the world see that a mighty Angel come down no so if you can see that he said but the world will not see me but we can see him in the way he manifesting himself how when the two men from him was walking with him he walked with them the entire day but when we came and broke the bread which he's typing the word the way he brought forth the word they began to recognize that this is him amen amen so he said at that day you shall know that I am in my father and Y in me and I personal in you which day in this day amen yes in this day it is I in you because why in this day because this is the day the title lead has come down the headstone has come down to come to the body amen The Headstone has come to connect with the body and when the when the headstone has come down now the body knows what he wants done with the word now the body understands the purpose now the body understand amen how to manifest his word because he says he that had my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me how many people fight against this word how many people persecute this word but you got the word why you keeping the word amen the word told you to love whatever it tells you speaks about from serent seed Ty up all the loose talking about woman shouldn't be preaching talking about the church order Doctrine all these things what makes you love that word amen what makes you desire more Revelation all the time what makes you want to eat from this word amen and keep his word but he said he that had my commandment and keepeth them he is that loveth me so how do you love him by keeping his word and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him you see you keep his word you love his word then he must manifest himself to you amen the Jesus said unto him Lord how is it that will sorry not the scariot Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world in Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our bold with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the father would send me you see then he come and dwell then the shikina glory comes down the glory of the Lord comes where in this tab Tabernacle in this Tabernacle of Flesh amen so you find that he said these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance amen whatsoever I have said unto you peace I live with you see what Jesus said my peace I give unto you not as the world give it see this peace only come from Jesus Christ amen the world can never give you peace yes people can have this meditations they can go to the Mount T tiet like be a monk they can go to this AR Krishna devotees they can do all these yogas nobody can give them peace peace can only come to Jesus Christ he said my peace I give unto you not as the world give it I give unto you let not your heart be trouble let neither Let It Be Afraid see when you have the peace of God he's saying let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid why should you be afraid if you know that he's dwelling with you if you know that you're not walking alone in the hour yes amen remember he said they have they no one else could uh remember what the prophet said when the church had his everyone had their own mouth mouthpiece but Christ is waiting for someone who speak for him and it's this bride that will be his mouthpiece it will this bride should become the final voice in his final hour everyone else spoke for itself for its Creeds for its dogmas for its own doctrines but in this hour there will be a people that will speak for him amen amen a people that will work for him because they their hands their feet spreading the gospel is Jesus Christ amen our eyes looking knowing that you're the body of Christ you're the temple of God you look at it through you look at situations Through The Eyes of God's word that's why you look when you look at the news we know that signs are given in Heavens you look at things through God's word you look at any situation around you don't be deterred by what's happening don't be negative like the rest of the people he's given us his peace he said Shalom yes amen Shalom wasn't given any other age amen he was given in this age amen Shalom why Shalom the light has come amen yes something that you was needed in this hour your title leaders come down in this hour that's why you can have peace in this hour amen knowing the end results knowing what he has done for you knowing the full counsel of God knowing full Redemption knowing that salvation didn't just stop at Calvary amen it's a full restoration of what he's doing bringing us back take us back to the original condition that we supposed to be yes take us back to have dominion again amen you think God want us to have defeated lives yet let's see what he says he says he says here could you imagine a little fish about half inch long out in the middle of the ocean out J saying I better drink sparingly of this water I might run out certainly not well you could have never you could never exhaust God's power and God's goodness if you think God has been so good to me I feel bad to go ask him again you know he's blessed me with all his blessings and he's giving me so much of his word should I ask me for more Revelation you can't exhaust God he's an inexhaustable Fountain of Life yes and we drawing from this word is an eternal word yes there's so much more to it amen and we pray for more revelation of his word you might say but the prophet preached in the message there's so much in that message you might read the message over and over again but as you keep going you begin to see more things and more things and it becomes fresh to you it becomes in the present time amen you say well I receed the Holy Ghost the whole EV is full of it God is just trying it was all all the whole heaven was a great big stand pipe and you had one little crack he's trying to pile the water will try to force itself out that's the way the holy spirit is trying to force itself into you like that like trying to get you to believe it I know that's the truth can you believe that the Holy Ghost once to come to you amen you just have to surrender yourself to him and say Lord fill me up with more and more of you Lord amen he wants you to have the blessing yes he doesn't want you to eat of this word sparingly this word that he's given us the seven cause meal he's got so much more to give to us there's so much more that he wants to use us with Amen in this hour in this late in this closing hour where we are about to leave this earth when we about to pass the B over it's up to us amen yes to surrender ourselves to it's up to us to come to a realization am as we were fully known don't let the devil make us keep thinking in our flesh don't look at your brother and sister look at them in the flesh look at it as them as a son and daughter of God amen amen look at the Believers that son and daughters of God look at them as a bride of Christ no matter where they are around the world look at them as the bride of Christ as the body of Christ in this hour the one that's taking the word out in this hour amen because they and look at the Ministers of this gospel is our carriers of the Gospel until the Rapture takes place amen amen what a you know what a thing it is to to be in a 54 Ministry this hour because it carrying the gospel to the rapure takes place because there's no other age after this this is the last and last of the there's no other Gentile age after this 1 John 32 says beloved beloved now are we the sons of God yes and he do not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen what did he live in a glorified body amen and when we shall see him we will be in the glorified body but when he appeared to us in his hour he come in the form of the word amen and we recognize it through the word so all the preaching all the teaching and everything else he had done had failed but when he revealed himself doing the same thing he did before his crucifixion they knew it was him you see so when you see the word being manifested to you you know that is Christ speaking to you yes amen amen but if you if you're drawing from a from a broken system and you're drinking water that was stagnant where all the wiggle tales and so forth came in there then there's something wrong there yes amen but if you're drinking from the Fountain of Life amen Fresh Living Water amen fresh word then you see God identified himself yes you see the characteristics of Christ amen he said it's a total separation we not to go back into the world no more what have anything to do with the world but CLE only unto God Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world she separated from the Fashions of the Modern Age that we live in she's separated from the cares and traditions of churches she is separated only to God and God is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word become one amen for the word is living through the bride that's our that's a credentials that's a identification amen that's our true identification yes I know now even as I have been fully known amen amen there was a time time in season I was walking in the things of the flesh there was a time in season I thought I was just a normal Christian there was a time in season I was just happy with I believe that it was God sent a prophet there was a time and season I was happy with that and I was satisfied with that there was a time and season I was satisfied that now I believe in proper Church order and Doctrine it was good because why that's how a Christian should be yes it was proper Christian behavior and it was according to the Bible but it wasn't good enough because now I I'm a man I've grown in the word yes so as a man I must speak as a man and as a man I need strong Meats I need a diet for a mature Christian yes I need a diet that will take me and walk into another dimension amen I need to eat food that's going to change his body from this Earthly Dimension to a Heavenly dimension amen but now the word is come in the season to show me who I really am Amen to show me and I'm not just someone who came and just received the word and yes but I'm somebody that is part of the scriptures I'm somebody that is part of redemption amen I'm somebody that walked when God was walking in the Garden of Eden I was walking there with him amen when God said let there be light I was in his thoughts yes when he said let there be light when God was creating the heavens and the Beautiful M the earth and the Beautiful creation the the mountain the Seas the forest and all these beautiful things I was in his thoughts that he created it for me amen and when man is destroying the Earth and God is writing the scriptures through the through His prophets and he said God and he said I to destroy man for destroying the Earth God had me in his thoughts he saw that his Earth is not a foot dwelling place for me when he went on Calvary because of what Satan has done and he took man and put him in a fallen State and he was going to go there when the body was laying in the Tomb and then he went down in his still off the body and when he went to the Souls Lost in prison then went and took the keys from Satan for dead and the grave I was in his thoughts amen amen when he went and defeated Satan and he paid the price I was in his thoughts when the pierced him on his side and he said father it is finished I was in his thoughts am amen so now I know even as I have been fully known because I was in the mind of Christ amen I was in the Eternal thoughts of God and now when I became manifested on the earth I see myself walking out of the scriptures oh thank you Lord I see my brothers and sisters walking out of the scriptures thank you Lord where my brother and sisters is coming walking believing the word rejoicing the word I said that is a son and daughter of God amen amen when I see a 54 Ministry is standing here I said that is Christ speaking to that man amen amen that is Christ speaking to me through his gift I see the gift of God in that person yes I look Beyond the Veil amen than when you say when you see a brother and sister coming to having his faults and failure said Lord Satan you will not put my brother down amen you will not keep my brother down there that is my brother that is my sister they are son and daughter of God they are paid with a price yes because why you are convinced of this message and now you are concerned when you seeing this world dying out in his sin and you seeing Souls that are being lost souls that are going to hell you cannot be quiet you are concerned for them amen because those that are full with the Holy Ghost are crying and sighing for the abomination of the L amen amen what is that the spirit of Christ in you because why everything that Christ was you are amen all that was in God he pour into Christ all that was in Christ he pour into his church he left us in his hour in the most difficult age to do the Greater Works Amen in the most hardest age to do the Greater Works but in it is in this age there will be a people that will not see dead there'll be a people that will literally changed from Mortal to immortality amen there'll be a people that will have a walk that like Enoch walked with God this people will walk with God how do they walk with God when they recognize that they are the temple of God God in them amen Walking with God yes that's how you're walking with God God dwelling in you you better make it comfortable for him because the Holy Spirit takes his flight the M of the life is not right so you want to make it comfortable for the Holy Spirit to dwell in you recognize be conscious of his presence always and God is mindful that the flesh wants to fail but that is why title just come down to make us have dominion say like Adam could say you Mountain go there you tree go there you bird you belong there you tiger you belong there you lion you be away from there you say yourself you start having dominion over your own Earth so you don't belong here you go out Satan you demon that's coming to influency you go out you demon that's coming you get away from me amen you start to have dominion over this flesh first over this Earth amen the sixing element this is the earth you start having dominion over because why you see the entire Plan of Redemption you see the temple of God in your brother you see the temple of God in your sister God dwelling in a many membered body amen you love him amen amen I know now even as I've been fully known man you wouldn't have known this without the revelation of the word without the opening of the word yes without this it was a partial realization yes but now is the hour you come to a perfect realization amen didn't Paul say I prophesy in part amen we know in part we prophesy in part you also had a partial realization but when you come into a perfect realization of who you are then you began to see the responsibility that lays within you the responsibility lays within me because unto whom much is given much is required amen we don't have much time before the Lord will come again we don't have much time amen we can see the signs all around us yes we can see what is happening in Russia Prophet said watch Russia watch Russia watch Russia we can see the condition in America we can see where that's going we can see the whole world turning against Israel when the time will come when everyone will hate Israel persecute Israel no one will stand for her yes and they will start to cry out to him and that is and watch when Israel cries out go back to the book of in Exodus in the first Exodus the Lord said to Moses I heard the Cry of the children of Israel and the task Masters how they cried about the task Masters and so forth and then he remembered he said I remember the Covenant so God won't forget the Covenant when they cry out so can you imagine how late it is in this can you imagine what's left for us that is why there's no other age and no other this is a season where God is showing us things rapidly this is the season where he's bringing us now to our full responsibility if I could put it that way that is why he's showing us who we are that's why he's showing us that we were fully known he's showing us our true potential maybe there was a time we didn't see our true potential and that is why that slave he didn't want to act like every other slave he conducted himself different because he knew his true potentials he knew that no matter that he kept here maybe a temporary period he belongs to a place yes and in the place that he belongs to his father was the king of the tribe and he is the king son that identity can never be taken away from him amen he was born with an identity yes Lord we might be trapped in the SP to we might be not known well in society we might not be popular in society in this world we not be might not be popular with the things of this world but we know who we truly are amen the word has come to show us who we are truly are amen that we are son and daughter not of a king but of the king amen and all the and all the things that we can see with our spiritual eyes when your eyes open you say but are just temporal thing people are just feeding their lives off for living for 70 years 80 years 90 years old 95 people are living older now 90 95 98 people are living like that now but is death how can you compare that to Eternity amen people are selling their souls for eternity but God has come to show us that we already been sealed yes you know what that means when you are seal now you must go to your destination that seal can only break at the destination yes it's sealed no one else can break that seal because no man sealed you but you are sealed with the Holy ghosten if the Holy Ghost seals you it's good to go it's a good genine product it must go to the destination amen so we are seal until the day of our Redemption we have the down payment amen that's the earners of our inheritance amen we have the earners of our inheritance down payment showing us here the proof here the proof of your inheritance yes here the proof Esa I've given you to half of the kingdom yes it's up to you to take it now it's up to you to speak now it's up to you to write your own law amen amen amen he's given us the responsibility of his work yes he's opened the full potential of Heaven to us amen he blessed us with all what Paul said he blessed us with all spiritual blessing the full potential is open to us in this hour because he knows that these are a responsible people he placed that responsibility of his word to us amen amen I have known as I've always known been known amen God bless you I pray
