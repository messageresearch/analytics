brother Wilson talinga he has also got the infection of red eyes so just pray that the Lord may put his protection upon us let us pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we are thankful and grateful unto you for what you have done for us father we magnify and glorify your Holy Name you are the same yesterday today and forever and Lord we depend upon you for everything Lord and we thank you again for We've Come Again into your presence and Lord Jesus you said in your word that where two or three are gathered in your name you will be there in their midst and Lord we believe you are here in our midst Lord you also promised in your word that they shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be their peace may you teach us Heavenly Father through your word that we may have such peace that surpasses all understanding father we commit all our burdens and all our cares into your hands we even pray for all our brothers and sisters on the way coming bring them safely even those

Lord and bless us all together Lord we love you and we thank you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and ask this amen so let us turn to our Bibles and we go to the book of Isaiah chapter 1 Isaiah chapter 1 I'm reading from verse 16 up to verse 19 Isaiah chapter 1 verse 16 to verse 19 so the Bible says wash ye make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes see cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the Widow come now and let us rason together says the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land may God bless of his word you may be seated so I want to preach on the subject be willing and obedient that's in verse 19 be willing and obedient praise the name of our lord it's a very very important that we are willing in other words we agree we accept we yield praise the name of our Lord like you know when you hear the word of God have a willing heart accept that word praise the name of our Lord you know take it it's just like a woman who is going to be taken in marriage before the woman is married she has to accept praise the name of our Lord like Ela when he was sent to get a bride for Isaac and when he met Rebecca and he saw by Revelation that Rebecca was the wife that was meant to be taken for Isaac he asked where do you come from who are your parents and then he said is there room for us to come and spend the night there and even enough animal feets she said it's okay and then now they went home and then Ela started giving a testimony of how the Lord LED him to to find that it's Rebecca who is meant to be Isaac's wife and you know the Bible says that the family of Rebecca said if the woman would be willing you get it so there has to be an acceptance there has to be a consent you know you to accept it and this is the same thing with the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that when you hear the word of God you have to accept it have a willing heart and this is why the Bible says that if you be willing so like now they had to ask Rebecca are you willing to go with this man are you willing to get into the marriage and that's the same thing that comes when people are making marriage convenants you know they ask the man is there anything that you think can impede you from marrying this person he says no Then they ask the woman is there anything that can prevent you from marrying this man they says no so there has to be a willingness there has to be an acceptance and this is now how the Lord also wants us to be we must be willing we must have an acceptance you must consent you know you have to agree with the word of God praise the name of our Lord and then now when you consent he says and be obedient praise the name of our Lord like when Rebecca accepted you know she said it's okay then she had now to be obedient to the instructions of elazar she had to allow elza said this is the horse which is going to carry or the camel and then she had to follow that until now when she reached in the field and then she saw Isaac he said who's what is that who is that person he says that is my master then Rebecca covered herself and when she got into the marriage she had to go and work according to the marriage kind of way it works and that's the same thing with the Gospel of Jesus Christ we have heard the word of God we have accepted the word of God we have believed the word of God but that we need to be obedient praise the name of our Lord we need to be obedient to the word of God you know when the word of God tells us do this thing that's what God expects from us so you have a willing heart and then you are obedient and then the Bible says in Isaiah 1 19 it says if you be willing and obedient the Bible says you shall eat the good of the land praise the name of our Lord he says if we are willing and then we are obedient we shall eat the good of the land now in the message questions and answers he says the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is Promised through the Old Testament and the new two the promise behold I send the promise of my father upon you Peter said that on the day of Pentecost that is the promise the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit and so now also if we are going to live in the land of the Holy Spirit we need to be willing and obedient to the word of God praise the name of our Lord whever the Holy Ghost leads us praise the name of our Lord be willing and obedient if the will of God is this be willing and obedient and then the Bible says then you'll eat the good of the land in other words you'll take possession over that land you'll be able to enjoy the benefits that are in the land of the Holy Spirit then he says that is God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of these conditions that you've been in to come out to live in the promised land to receive the promise remember the promise you shall receive power from on high after this the Holy Ghost is come upon you and Peter said that the promise that was made all down through the testament old and new you find promising on up on up to the day of Pentecost and then they entered into the promise praise the name of our Lord so he says the land we we are now talking about is the land of the Holy Spirit you know every Divine promise of God Is Right within the holy spirit so he says if if we can be willing and if we can be obedient to the word of God then we eat the good of the Holy Ghost we eat the good of the land praise the name of our Lord you eat the goodness of the Holy Spirit you get the peace in your heart you get the joy of the Lord in your heart you got you get the patience the longsuffering you are eating the good of the land and you see what we possess are Eternal things praise the name of our Lord and those Eternal things you can't buy them with money but you see you have to be willing and obedient for you to possess the good things of the land praise the name of our Lord what an assurance that we have that if we can like God has given us the privilege that we have heard the word of God so when we hear the word of God let us be having a willing mind a willing heart praise the name of our Lord and then you obey the word of God and that's how the word of God will bring its impact Upon Our Lives that's how we shall be changed and the Bible talks about being changed from glory to glory and every day we have to be growing praise the name of our Lord you can't say me I stopped growing in the spirit keep on growing keep on possessing more land keep on overcoming your weaknesses if my weaknesses today are something then tomorrow not be the same thing that means that I'm possessing there's something I'm gaining the way God told them that every in where your foot will take you'll possess it praise the name of our Lord so we just need to possess praise the name of our Lord all that the Lord has promised us now in Exodus chapter 23 and then verse 20 Exodus 23 and then verse 20 the scripture says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared that's what the Bible is telling us he sent an angel he send an angel before us to keep us in the way praise the name of our Lord he sent an angel to keep us in the way and to bring us into the place which he has prepared for us like last time I believe it was wedes day you know we were looking at the promise of our day what promise do we have of our day praise the name of our Lord and then we saw the promise is the change of our bodies the promise is that these mortal bodies must put on immortality so that's our possession that is our Target so now the Bible is telling us that God has sent an angel before us to keep us in the way that he may bring us praise the name of our Lord to the place that he has prepared for us so the angel is here to take us to adoption the angel is here to take us to the change of our bodies praise the name of Lord and so what we have to do is to be willing and obedient he has sent down the Holy Ghost so allow the spirit of God the Holy Ghost the inside teacher to do his leadership to do his guiding to tutor us praise the name of our Lord that we may be brought to the point of adoption to serve the purpose of God for our lives praise the name of our Lord so he says the angel knows the way he knows what we have to go through every other day and then God gives us the grace to overcome these things what we have to do is to be willing and obedient praise the name of our Lord then verse 21 it says be aware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgress for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto th adversaries for mine Angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the Hittites and the parites and the Canaanites and the hites and the jebusites and I'll cut them off praise the name of our Lord so the Bible is telling us let us obey the voice of of the Angel and we know that we live we have been Liv we have been in the seven Church ages and here we are now in the lisian church age and when you look at the messages to the church ages in Revelations chapter 1 and chapter 2 and chapter 3 the message was coming to the angel praise the name of our Lord and so we have also had an angel in the Lordan Church age and that angel brought the message so now we need also to obey the voice of the Angel praise the name of our Lord we need to be obedient to the message that we have received come back with evidence and then he said without perfect love you cannot be there praise the name of our Lord so now we have got the message of the hour to bring us into the full possession of what God has prepared for us praise the name of our Lord like John chapter 14 Jesus said I go and prepare a place for you that's what the scripture says so now and then brother Brandon preaches about this in message things that are to be and then your brother Bram was so much privileged to get into that land into that place that the Lord has prepared for them that love him praise the name of our Lord and so we have such a great promise that God has given us a message God has sent us a message has given us an assurance a proof that this message praise the name of our Lord will lead us to the change of our bodies so then we need to be willing and obedient to the message that God has given unto us praise the name of our Lord then in 19 I believe it was 1964 either 1964 65 I'm forgetting brother brandham had you know that Vision about the preview of the bride all these were things that God was assuring our age that this is what is before you praise the name of our Lord this is what is before us so we need to see that we run the race with patience praise the name of our Lord we run the race with patience like Paul say praise the name of our Lord that you know I strive to the mark of the High Calling of our Lord Jesus Christ and the mark of our high calling now is the change of our bodies that's the climax we have to look to every day that you live are you living a life and obedient to the message obedient to the leadership of the Holy Ghost that your body has to be changed from this moral body to immortality praise the name of our Lord you know these are the promises that the Lord has given us great and precious promises praise the name of our Lord so now in the message the angel of the Lord he says God went down there and told mes said to yourself go down there and tell the people then he says I hard in far's heart CU he won't believe and do could you imagine that how a man that rejects light when God sent down there with Moses it was not Moses it was God and God said I'll send an angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared is that right and when the children of Israel seen this Angel he was a pillar of fire praise the name of the Lord I'm just oldfashioned enough to believe that God is the same yesterday today and forever the same God with the same power now when he appeared back there first he was a Roy wind in a bush to me when he appeared and I come as Moses of all to tell you not to follow me but follow Christ believe him that is here here to heal all the sick the needy do you believe it and I believe is there to heal those who have need of him save those put those in highness of God do you believe that send them out to be Soul winners and to preach the gospel how marvelous he is praise the name of our Lord so brother Bram also giving a testimony that the angel of the Lord is here to lead to guide praise the name of our Lord to bring Deliverance praise the name of our Lord and so we see that we have also the same privilege like those people had before we also have the same privilege now much as brother Bram is of the scene but we still have the message of the Lord and not only the message but the angel of the Lord is right here with us also praise the name of our Lord and not only the angel of the Lord but the Holy Spirit himself praise the name of our Lord the Holy Spirit himself in our lives you know he guides us he leads us praise the name of our Lord and then we get to know the mind of God concerning our lives praise the name of our Lord so we need to be willing and obedient to follow all the word that God has given unto us and then you don't do something you know you don't take something partial or you select this and say this one I'm not taking it we need to take the whole counsel of God we need to take the whole word of God because it is all God praise the name of our Lord let us go to Deuteronomy chap 12 and verse 28 so the Bible says observe and hear all these words which I command thee that it may go well with you and with your children after thee forever when thou does that which is good and right in the sight of the Lord thy God praise the name of our Lord seeking to do that which is good and right every day in every decision that we make in our thoughts in our imaginations everywhere you are maybe at home or at place of work or at school or you are traveling among strangers always seek to do that which is right and acceptable before God praise the name of our Lord and then there you know that you'll be pleasing to God so you'll be able to take possession of the land you'll be take possession of the promises of God that he has given us in this day praise the name of our Lord he says do good and write what is acceptable before the eyes of God all the time praise the name of our Lord then in Deuteronomy chapter 15 and verse 5 he says only if th carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all these Commandments which I command thee this day for the Lord thy God blesses thee as he promised thee and thou shall lend unto many nations but thou shall not borrow and thou shalt Reign Over many nations but thou shall not Reign but they shall not Reign Over You Now these are promises these are blessings these are ways teaching us how do we Acclaim those promises how do we reach those promises he says hearken to the voice of the Lord be willing be obedient and when you are obedient then you take possession of the promises of God you take possession of the land of what the Lord has promised us praise the name of our Lord you possess it so you have to be allowing the spirit of God to lead us praise the name of our Lord now in the message the angel of the Lord is says now notice in the old days when God told Moses now you go and I'll send an angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared be aware of him only obey his voice for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him that angel was the angel of the Covenant which was Christ Jesus the people many of them did not believe it those who did not believe perished those who did believe went on into the Promised Land and the men who reject light went into total darkness and I believe today those who reject the Holy Spirit In The Light Of God the days of Miracles and for so forth go back into total darkness did you see how the Pharisees heart how dark it got he did not have nothing to do no more with the Israelites he showed them no favor because he Harden his heart against the light and Men Who Harden their heart against the light walk in darkness now that's where the danger is because he says today if you hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the day of provocation then Pharaoh heard the voice and he kept on hardening his heart so the prophet says he went into the darkness he perished and so here we've heard the voice voice the message of the hour praise the name of our Lord so we need to be obedient to the voice that we've heard and then when we are obedient the voice that we had then the voice will make us we shall be able to see the good of the land to test the good of the land praise the name of our Lord we shall be in position to take possession over all the things that God has promised us in this day then he says brother sister in the name of our Lord please get me right now what I'm trying to say to you that God who came out in the old days and led the Church of God out of Egypt the bondage in Freedom has come down again in the same manner to lead his church spiritual out of bondage of sin by the Holy Spirit sickness next and the third step is to go into grow take this motor and make it morality the Transfiguration of the human bodies to transform them into the perfect image of the Son of God please believe with all your heart praise the name of our Lord you know so what this what the Lord is doing he wants to take us into Glory he wants to change us you know whereby our mortal bodies shall put on immortality praise the name of our Lord so we have to be willing and obedient the message that we've received let us be willing and obedient the word that is given to us let us be willing and obedient then we shall be able to take possession of the land we shall be able to see the goodness of the Lord even when we are still alive here praise the name of our Lord all the things that the Lord has promised you know the fruit of the spirit coming down freely in our lives because the Bible says the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace so that Spirit Bears his fruit in us so it's until you are willing and obedient to the Holy Spirit that's when you can manifest the holy spirit in your life by manifesting the fruit of the spirit bearing all the fruit of the spirit regardless of the circumstances that you go through praise the name of our Lord so we just need to see that we are obedient we dedicate ourselves unto the Lord praise the name of our Lord that we can take we can be able to take full possession of what God has promised us now in the message the faith of Abraham he says now his promises is under condition if thou can't believe he says all the promises of God the condition is is if you can believe he says do you have faith do you believe praise the name of our Lord he says when God sent Israel from Egypt 400 years before he gave the promise to Moses beg your pardon or to Abraham here that his seed would SJ but would come again into the land bringing great possessions and when they started on their Journey he said behold I send an angel before you the pillar of fire to keep you in the way to bring you to the place which I have provided for you he said the whole thing is yours and when they got there they saw it all fenced up tightly with the amorites the parasites the hites the Juanes the jebusites all different kinds great High wall City all first in but he said it is yours now God don't go over there and say here all the jebusites and all you get out of here I'm bringing isra in no you got something to do yourself it's yours now go possess it oh I like it it belongs to you I'll give it to you do you believe it so he didn't the prophet is telling us he didn't go and remove the jebusites the Canaanites but he told them go so they had to have faith praise the name of our Lord and when Joshua and the 11 spies reached the land of Canaan they said that they are giants then the other 10 spy says we are like grasshoppers but then Joshua and calb said we are more than able to possess the land praise the name of our Lord and we should have the same faith that maybe the devil has been afflicting you for such a long time but then you need to have the confidence that you're more than able to overcome that situation in your life praise the name of our Lord you just take that courage we are more than able praise the name of our Lord look for example when they reached Jericho Jericho was a world city wellfed but what did God tell them God told Joshua go and walk around the city for seven days the first day they walked around Jericho the second day they walked around Jericho until the seventh day and on the seventh day says walk around it seven times that was God's instructions walk around the city seven times and then when you have walked around it and you've surrounded it then start shouting that was the instruction praise the name of the Lord and when they started shouting the city started collapsing praise the name of our Lord so it's also the same thing also for us be willing and obedient and then the Lord himself knows what he's going to do praise the name of our Lord the pillar of fire LED them right to the Red Sea there was no big big fairy there or Bridge there it was not there but the Lord knew what he was doing until when they got there and cried to go to help them that's when the waters divided praise the name of our Lord so God is also still the same God that in the midst of the challenges or the hardships that may come our way he has always got a way to overcome those things praise the name of our Lord so just only be willing and obedient to follow the voice of the Lord praise the name of Lord so it doesn't matter what the obstacle is praise the name of our Lord it doesn't matter what the circumstance before you is the promise of God has to come to pass praise the name of our Lord the promise has to come to pass the mission has the mission has to be fulfilled praise the name of our Lord like Jonah he was sent to nevi then he was running away but God made everything work out until the Sheep the fish didn't take Jonah to tashes where they where it got him from but took him to Nev where the city God wanted him to preach praise the name of our Lord so God made the circumstance work out for the glory of His holy name so we shouldn't be deterred we shouldn't be hindered by the obstacles that we go through every other day we should not do that let us just believe God trust in God to give us victory in everything that we are going through praise the name of our Lord then he says that's the reason 10 spies is God said you could the other one said you can't that's the reason 10 spies when they come back say we can't take it why are we look like grasshoppers up beside them people but old Joshua and calb said we can't do it why God said so praise the name of our Lord that should be the same confession we have when God has said anything just say the same thing praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says the spirit and the bride say come we need to have the same voice with the Holy Spirit we need to have the same voice with the angel of the Lord and then that's how we shall be able to take full possession then he says these other weaklings was looking through the physical side oh it is great we could never do that we could never teach Divine Healing and get by with it we could never have old time Pentecostal Revival they could count as fanatics but thank God Somebody went over and got the evidence and come back it is a good land praise the name of our Lord and that stimulates our desires you know like that Vision or that experience beyond the curtain of time you know the preview of the Bride it gives you such encouragement praise the name of our Lord that is something that God has put before us whereby we have to strive to reach that Mark praise the name of our Lord and then he says but thank God Somebody went over and got the evidence and come back it's a good land amen went over there and come back why they wasn't looking to the physical side of it they were looking to what God had promised I don't care how high defense is what the doctor said he's done the best he could what mother said what the pastor said the days of Miracles passed that don't have nothing to do with it look to to what God Said God made the promise we take it amen I like that courage courage to stand on what God said now listen this may hurt a little bit rra for the feathers up the wrong way you know but real children of Abraham Seed of Abraham believe that CU you are dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and are hairs according to the promise the same Holy Spirit was in Christ is in you and you believe the same thing so if you do not believe remember there's something lacking cuz the holy spirit will certainly agree with his own word praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that we believe the Lord we take the word the way it is praise the name of our Lord believe God let it be at as he has said take him at his word praise the name of our Lord be willing and obedient then you will test the good of the land praise the name of our Lord so now let us go to 1 John 5:3 the Bible says for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and he his Commandments are not Grievous they are not burdensome they are not heavy they are not to afflict us that's the scripture his commandment his light says my yoke is easy praise the name of our Lord so be willing and obedient to it obey the voice of God obey the word of God and that's how you know you'll find yourself revived that's how you'll find yourself walking in the will of God praise the name of our Lord that's what the Lord has prepared for us is when he gives us his word he wants us to be following what the word says He says in the message the seven Church ages it is God's word that brings life and it's not what we say about the word that counts but it is what God Said So the word brings life so Allah love love that word accept that word follow that word obey that word and then it will bring what it has promised in our lives praise the name of our Lord and then you'll see that you are taking over places where you are weak places where have been failing but you have allowed the Lord to take charge over your life praise the name of our Lord so then you able to get the possession of the promises of the Lord praise the name of our Lord and then in another place brother Bram says that God's displeasure is for people to leave the word like you know that's what he said in all other ages people were living the word and the only way they he could tell them is get back to the word that's the way whenever they leave the word he says get back to the word in all ages you know the trouble was the same so he was telling them get back to the word so he says repent get back to from where you have fallen get back there praise the name of our Lord and that's the same thing is we need when we hear the word of God let us be willing have a willing mind accepting it in your heart and when you accept it in your heart be obedient to that word make sure that that word praise the name of our Lord is precious before you you cherish that word and then it will bring the promises that it has promised it will bring life praise the name of our Lord the Bible has told us his word is not Grievous praise the name of our lord it's not Grievous it's not heavy it is something that you can follow all the way praise the name of our Lord after everything that we see was made by the word of God then how can we deny the word of God how can we put the word of God aside and see that we can be alive but here if we can obey the word of God then we can be alive we can be quickened by the same living word of God praise the name of our Lord let us go to coron 1 coronal chapter 28 1 chonicles 28 and then verse verse 9 the Bible says and though Solomon my son know th the Lord of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind praise the name of our Lord he says serve him with a perfect heart that means a whole heart you know not half heart but the whole heart with a willing mind for the Lord searches all hearts and and understands all imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek Him He will be found of thee if thou forsake Him He will cast thee off forever praise the name of our Lord so we need to be willing and obedient when you hear the word of God be obedient to that word and that's how you'll overcome your weaknesses when you are obedient and that's what we've been called to do every promise of God he wants us to be believing it and obedient to it you take it as your own this is what the Lord wants me to do so you possess it you own it praise the name of our Lord and so David was telling Solomon serve god with your whole heart the other place he told us do that which is right and good before God what is acceptable before God praise the name name of our Lord in other words you have the ability to make discernment to make a judgment over the issue you're going through and see how you can seek what is right and pleasing before God and then when you are doing that with a willing heart with a perfect heart and a willing mind then you'll be able to perform all that the Lord has promised praise the name of our Lord we shall be able to take possession of all the things that God has promised us in our generation praise the name of our Lord now in the message as I finish in the seven Church age book he says he has made us whole there are certain truth we need to emphasiz this is one of them he has made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings oh we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 for If by one's man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ and Colossians 1:13 who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son then he says right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the one the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise the name of our Lord so he has made us himself we just be willing and obedient and allow God to bring that transformation in your life he has made us Kings and brother says right now we are spiritual Kings we Reign Over The Devil we Reign Over The Flesh we Reign Over The World We Reign Over sin all those things that are contrary to God we Reign Over them so he has given us the ability praise the name of our Lord to take possession over these things blessed be the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so God has called us to a higher level praise the name of our Lord but you see when we are still living in this flesh we always we most of our time most of our thoughts are taken over by the things of this
