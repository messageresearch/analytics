of uh you know Papa and then they die in the wilderness but the rest keep soing will you continue with the journey amen because in this calling God calls you as an individual amen just uh in the week I you know two weeks now I had a situation that when I would go to bed I would get problem on my left like there is a stone on the inside here a stor you wouldn't turn on the bed the way you want so I had go and visit a cardiologist amen so they took all the ECG and whatever they do and they told me you don't have enough blood running to your heart so I need your prayers amen and sister Gloria today is in trying to have a baby so we also remember her in our prayers amen amen so I rarely dream and remember when I dream I just know there was a dream but I could figure it out but you know on Saturday 27th I mean that was Friday was it yesterday yeah Friday I got a dream uh and it was at a very old hour I normally wake up in very early in the morning sometimes at 3 4 to do my study and then uh at around six something I normally catch another hour so uh it was at 7:40 in the morning I dreamed in this dream I was in a convention in the area of and so we were staying in a house with which was close to the meetings and a few of us were leaving I mean were seated in the uh you know living room and suddenly appeared brother godf very smartly dressed is the one responsible for Designing the background of our church a few of us you know when we looked at him he greeted us and he disappeared into a bedroom and nobody seemed to follow him later he appeared standing behind my my seat and laying his right hand on my left shoulder then I told the people people that brother passed on and I preached his funeral and because we were two of us that took the services it was so real I then intended to call another brother brother Freeman whom some of you know very well that come and greet brother Godfrey but I mentioned the wrong name and I called brother hington but then later I corrected and says come and greet brother godri and they shook hands with him I remember very well in the dream I started telling the people that brother Bram said that our loved ones will appear Among Us first and then we shall be CH amen immediately I said that again he had disappeared then I woke up so you know sometimes we look at the times that we are living here amen time is no longer and then if there is any form of seriousness we need it should be now because when you look at everything happening in the Middle East amen there is already a very big problem all the nations are rising against Israel and it's prophesied that it would happen like that so you know you just don't understand what season we are living in so the most important thing is to be ready one of these days all our loved ones they appear in service here amen and then you'll say oh that's brother so and so sister so and so and so our mind so much J into the coming of the Lord and so for that we should be ready read amen let's stand up and get into the scripture reading we turn to the Book of Revelations chapter 18 and we are still dealing with the Messianic Kingdom amen and this morning I want to speak speak on a call into the kingdom where are we called from and so that's what I want to deal with this morning let us pray PR father we thank you so much because you are here together with us father we are going into the most Sac moment of the service the teaching of the word you said in your word that blessed are those who hear and blessed are those who read I pray that you may bless your people in this moment some of them have got needs father I pray that you may meet them and above all father Help the People Help us together that we may have an entr into this Kingdom in Jesus name amen so um the title is Messianic Kingdom the call into the Kingdom so in verse one of Revelation 18 after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted with his glory and he cried with a mighty with a mighty I mean he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babon the great is Fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every F Spirit and the cage of every unan and hateful for all nations have drunk of the wine the of and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are Works reach through the delic I mean the abundance of our [Music] Delicacies and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people be not partakers of and that you receive not of [Music] her come out over my people a call into the kingdom may God bless of the so in this morning we pray that the Lord May really give us Grace you see Israel was called from a natural Kingdom which is Egypt to make a natural Kingdom in Exodus I mean in in Canaan and that was a natural Exodus but we are called from what the scripture calls the kingdoms of Darkness to the spiritual Kingdom of Light meaning that the new birth is a spiritual exod amen there is somewhere we come from we come from a spiritual babon which is a mix of all different forms of cultures and traditions and this mixture is what we call mystery Babylon the great mother ofs and all Abominations of the earth so it's in Babylon the kingdom the ancient Kingdom where all the elements of the Fall were given prominence amen so I want us to just have a brief trail of how sin come you know we look at uh you know from the garden we see the serpent he beg and then we also see that the same spirit moves into C into the slot of Abel and then after that we see H in the ark and then you see we Trail and come to Kush and then after Kush we look at Nim in the tower of babyon so to Babylon which was polishing of all evil before it again so it's the serpent it's Abel it's because the sin crossed over then it's then in the Tower of Babel and then finally we see the real Kingdom of babyon so now Babel is the original name of Babylon it means confusion so in today's study we are going to go into quite a number of scriptures to help us understand what we are called out of because many times we think that we came out of one Church into another church no sir to come out of Babylon mystery Babylon is to come out of the confusion that originates from Babylon amen are you together with me so it's possible while you sit in this assembly that you are still in babyon because the elements of Babylon sometimes have never died out of our amen so as I said Babel is the original name of babyon it means confusion it was literally started by Kush the son of H but was brought to a kingdom of power and Grand under his son Nim which the Bible calls Nimrod the mighty hunter in Genesis 11 so Babylon is a mix of three major Global operations is encompassed in three elements amen praise the Lord political power amen religious power and then Commerce three things which govern the Earth political power religious power and then Comm sometimes when you understand the history behind what God requires of you then it will be possible for you to do the right thing are you together with come out ofon I said that's a common saying but what does it mean this is what I want to deal with amen so these three these three which is political power religious power and commas they make the world systems and unfortunately we cannot live without them but yet we can live above them are you together with me you cannot live in a world where there's no politics amen because it's just natural that when people come together a leader emerges amen like in the kingdoms of this world praise God so you cannot do without control amen I'm sure that in the beginning there nobody who voted toak but some kind of guy sees a number of people together and Imes and says I'm going to rule you and then he gets another son and makes sybol St that's how things start amen these are Spirit amen that govern the Earth and you cannot be together amen without you know religion it just emerges a certain belief comes and then the people begin to roll around and finally you cannot live without Commerce because you have to buy and sell amen so we are engulfed in a community where all these three control but while we live in it we have the ability to live above let's go to John chapter 17 and verse 15 verse 15 says I pray not that thou should take them out of the world Amen he says that don't pray that you may take them out of the world but that you should keep them from the evil that's in the world Amen that's the prayer when Jesus was living he saw the control upon the Earth and he says well we are not I'm not I'm praying that you don't take them off to come with me but I pray that as they live here you keep them from the evil that's in the world Amen praise the Lord and he says they are not of the world even as I am not of the world Amen so in your Direct Communications you will always rub shers with the world where you go to work you are rubbing shoulders with the world in your school you are rubbing shoulders with the world Amen but then God desires that you live beyond the control of the environment that surrounds you when you are together with thieves Amen in some kind of a society maybe they are my neighbors I should not become a fear if I am working with a drunker I shouldn't become a drunker because there is a prayer that the Lord said over you that while you live among those circumstances you cannot be overcome by them you will live above them amen so in first John chapter 2 verse 15 he says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him amen so love not the world now there's a difference between the Earth and the world there is a difference between the two between you know the GE [Music] out amen and also the systems that are in that Earth so one is the kingdom I mean one uh is the [Music] world H and then let me try because he's failing to get the difference between the two the Earth is your vegetation the Earth is the mountains the rivers The Valleys the plains the that's the Earth but then the world so this world here is a system that's brought forth by the people that live on the earth so you now understand so now the Bible says love not the world amen love not the world the Bible doesn't say that love not the Earth because the Earth was a creation of God but the world is the systems of the people are you together with me yeah so now the Bible says love not the world [Music] neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of God is not in him so you understand now so let us look at the world Amen Let us look at the world and the systems that govern it which God says we should not laugh where did it begin from amen let's go to Revelation chapter 18 where we read the Bible says that after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory so the Bible in I mean Revelation 18 it begins by saying after these things what things the things that are described in Revelation 17 because in Revelation 17 the Bible is talking about a beast which has got a uh let's get there before we can be able to understand this very well amen I was telling brother James that I end up preaching for quite some bit of period because I don't want to leave anybody behind now here in Revelation chapter 17 there is a voice that talks with John amen and then he says you know he was called To A wilderness to see so now verse three so he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blashe having seven heads and 10 H so in Revelation chapter 17 amen there is a thought which is picked to come to that and now that point is in Revelation 13 Verse 18 you just leave your finger there because we shall be going back to 17 he says here is wisdom let him that understanding count the number of the Beast for the number of a man amen and this number 666 so when we are talking about a beast carrying a woman amen don't look at an animal look at a man who has set persisting are you together with me so in verse 4 of Revelation 17 he says and the woman was in purple and the scet color and decked with [Music] gold and precious stones and P having a golden cup in hand full of Abominations and fness of forication and this woman here is supposed to have been the church so we can call this woman a fallen woman a fallen Church are you together with me and it has got somebody that rides around and upon her [Music] forehead was written name mystery babon the great the mother of and Abominations of the earth amen are you together with me he says that mystery babyon the great mother praise God so she is not Babylon but she is a mystery Babylon so in this this woman the Bible says she Seth upon many Waters so these are symbols Revelation is the book of symbols in verse 15 We Now understand what the waters are verse 15 says and he says unto me the waters which thou seest amen where the who were SE are peoples and multitudes and Nations and tongs okay now so now they are describing this woman here and the Beast that carries her and then once he comes into chapter 18 verse one that's why he says after these things amen I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted in his glory and he cried mightly with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the H of every false Spirit and the C of every unclean and so where are we called out of we are called out of a church system that has fallen from the world so this babyon is a web that is knit around our social lives and all Natures of evil operates in this mystery Babylon under the power of politics religion and money so every of glob amen is kned around these factors we got business cels business cels amen we get different drug CS amen and they all operate under there but our major emphasis today is not on money and politics it's now you and me not to be CAU into that system that's what we are called out of because says for all nations have drunk of the wine of AR amen and the kings of the Earth have committed forication with her amen and the Marchers of the Earth are now greatly rich in the abundance of her delices and therefore I heard another voice from Heaven say come out of her my people Amen in the world but not of the world Amen Rising above that's why he says come out of all my people this is not going to be another Exodus amen like it was in Egypt your to come out is just for you not to be partaker of all the wrong things that happen in Babylon Amen in the Bible we've got an example of the children of Israel that were captured and taken into Babylon in captivity but then we've got three boys m and another one and sedra praise the Lord they were in Bon but they refus to worship the god of babon are you together with me in babyon But Rising above babyon we've got Daniel he was in Babylon a Fallen Kingdom which was wicked but Daniel raised above and you also you live in a mystery babon a fallen wild system but one thing which we pray for is that you may stand like Daniel in this babyon amen praise God listen to what the prophet say he says come out over my people say to the Lord come out of Babylon confusion come out of your of of your Creeds of your self styled things I will receive you says the Lord touch not the unclean things nether bnic parties in church and the bank and all other kind of stuffff and it dances he says come out so where are we coming from you are not coming from a natural world into another natural world like they came from egy into Canan that's not your call your call is to come out of the things that are generated in Babylon that those things don't have control over you the Fashions of this world will not appeal to you you find people some of them are going for a wedding and they go naked my little grandchild two years looked at a picture of one of the people that were a bright this morning and she said girl those are things that are generated in the Fallen system and the purpose of all these things is to gender sin amen praise the Lord you know verse five of Revelation 18 say upon her forehead was the name written mystery Babylon the mother of Hots and Abominations of the earth praise the Lord now this woman here that was riding on top of this Beast amen is called mystery babyon and the beest was the engineer behind her systems are you together with me you are going to understand today amen and understand where you come from what the gospel is calling you out amen so the F of our fornication means the fness of her unfaithfulness because she is supposed to have been a church that is married to the Lord Jesus Christ but that's not where her loyalty is you begin to show them scripture and prove to them that BM is in Jesus name and they refuse it you show them scripture that ladies should dress modestly they reject it are you together with me yeah it is a system that has got a hold of the people and when God is saving you that's the system he calls you out to take you into Messianic Kingdom where the word is our control amen so you know unfaithful to Divine leadership unfaithful to the instructions of Christ which is supposed to be the husband to the church so and Abomination therefore because she was Mother of harot Amen the groups that reject the word and they come from that Union every group is called hot amen are you together with me and then he says again appear that full of Abominations of the earth so when you are called out of babyon the main thing you are being called out of is the [Music] Abominations amen you come out of the Abominations if you come out of a religion and you Ser come to the message and then you walk in with the Abominations of the land you are still in Babylon while you're here so to come out of babyon is to totally come out of the uh you know traditions and uh the Abominations so Abomination means the things that are [Music] detestable something amen and it's only God who can tell us what an Abomination is are you together with me it's not you who declares what an Abomination is it's God who tells us what an Abomination is because he's the one who knows what is calling us out of as we come into the Messianic kingom amen so let us look at a few of these Abominations in Leviticus 18 and verse 22 I want you to write it down homosexuality is an Abomination okay because in Romans chapter one when the First Church of Rome fell the Bible says God gave them up to an unlean spirit and they started living together woman and wom and then men and men the Bible calls that an Abomination we come out of that we cannot be partaker of that kind of character amen Deuteronomy 7 verse 25 a wor ship involving Idols is an Abomination are you together with me we cannot involve ourselves in a worship where they are Idols some of these Idols you know sculptures but then there are where the men became the idol they desire to take the respect of God that's IDE I mean idol worship it's idolatry because no man can share this honor with the Lord Jesus Christ amen Deuteronomy chapter 18 verse 11 and 12 involving in Witchcraft and Consulting witches is an Abomination come out of that you are not supposed to be a partaker to astrology of any kind amen 22 and verse a woman wearing what pertains to a man is an abomination hallelujah hallelujah mother of and all Abominations of the earth so we need to know the Abominations out of which we are called amen I know one day when I put on a dress and I start moving on the streets of Ginger either they will say I'm mad all the police will arrest me because it's not natural the Bible calls it an Abomination so when you talk to these ladies who were interested on putting on a man's cloth they said the fry of a man looks to the but the one of the woman turns to the left but still the TR in our culture is accepted as a man's well but the people have taken for it the Bible says it's an Abomination amen so let's go to Proverbs chapter 15 and verse 8 the scripture says the sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord but the prayer of their PR is Delight are you together with me so now this is an Abomination where many of us could be found guilty we come to the church like this one we enjoy the teaching of the word but then we car certain forms of life that qualify Us in wickedness the Bible say the sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord amen an offering paid in sin is an Abomination you bring your offerings you bring your ti amen and you think think God is pleased with you he says that's an Abomination let me tell you a secret that's why we pay TI and become more [Music] poor the time is no longer we need to come out of babon and get into the Messianic Kingdom so that we can enjoy the services of Holiness in this Kingdom which is justification sanctification of the Holy Ghost and the Min of the [Music] world hallelujah hallelujah so Matthew 5 verse 23 if you bring thy gift to the altar and there remember that thy brother has out against thee are you together with me he says leave there thy gift before the Altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and for th gift the Bible says we should not be segregative among ourselves one family cannot talk to another family one sister cannot talk to another sister the Bible says if we are in that kind of condition the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination the prayers we offer become an Abomination we need to be in harmony with one another where two or three are gathered together in one unit of spirit and pray agree on anything it will happen the Holy Ghost come in Acts chapter 2 they were gathered in one and they were in one Spirit the Holy Ghost came praise the lord we need to drop all this kind of stuff as long as you still have the spirit of qu in your heart I want to tell you my brother that is an Abomination amen when you are in that condition and you want offer your offering now another Abomination here Proverbs 17 verse 15 the scripture says he that Jus the wicked has got no problem just drinking he that justif the wicked and he that condemn the just a brother is trying to do his level best Amen to serve God but then another man is condemning him he that condemn the just even they both an abomination to the Lord so now let me tell you we were called out of the Abominations and all Abominations originate from Babylon mother of and Abominations of the the world somebody say Amen there so now verse 16 this 16 does the Lord [Music] hate yeah seven are an Abomination unto him no Proverbs 17 16 yeah that's what I'm read so now you say what I say these six things that the Lord hate yeah seven are an Abomination unto him one a proud look the way you you know a proud look are changing style come out of all my people he says a proud look a ly Tong and hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devis Wicked [Music] imaginations and then the answer from another sister and that's the advice one the heart that devises Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift in running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh life and he that sth this among the Brethren he's saying those are Abominations they originate from Babylon come out of my people is not coming from that church to come into this world because mystery Babylon is not a location mystery is a spirit so FSE character is an Abomination it's detested dwelling among the saints when you have got a divisive character are you together with me okay let's go to eel 22 here another Abomination here verse 11 and one has committed Abomination with his neighbor's wife and another half Lely defiled his da and another in the has humbled his sister his father's daughter he says it's an Abomination and those things are out there in secret Inc is an Abomination So speaking of the New Jerusalem in Revelation 2127 he says and shall in no wise enter into it anything that defile whether neither whatsoever work Abomination all make a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah the door to the New Jerusalem you cannot enter it with an abomination amen this morning it's a morning where we drop all our Abominations and we say we are coming out of Babylon because we were told tou not their ways of life while we in the world God calls us to live above the world Amen and we thank God that today he gives us an opportunity to understand what we are called When God says come out of my people amen so this is a call Amen to make our lives right to wash away all the elements of Babylon amen he said there is no man that will enter there with an Abomination so stay away from the Abominations of babyon because no amen now eel chter 9 and verse one the holy spirit says listen to this text of scripture very carefully he cried also in my ears with a loud voices cause them that have church over the city to draw near even never man with his destroying weapon in his hand now these were the men that were supposed to guard Jerusalem but God is Anointed with Jerusalem because of the Abominations and he tells the men in that vision of Jeremiah that you gods come with your sword so they had rejected the message of Ezekiel and any form of rejection to the word results into judgment see and doing what seeth right in our judgment is an Abomination it's not me who can know what's right it's God who knows what is right and when he speaks to me God have mercy that I may keep under the blood washing every day when he makes me know this is from Babylon I wash it off I don't want to get to that door amen together with an Abomination so today this morning it's a washing time to wash away the Abominations come out of her is not geographical come out of her it's spiritual condition that you come out of to come into higher order amen praise the Lord Disobedience to the voice of the world Amen brings forth judgment but then among them in the six men that were called there was one that did not carry a judgment weapon amen six men and then there was one praise God he didn't have a judgment weapon amen are you together with me praise the Lord the Bible says let me take you back to verse one here and behold six men came from the higher from the higher gate which Li toward the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his and one man among them was closed with one man together with them amen he was carrying the writers inor by his side and they went in and stood by the altar six but the Bible says one of them among them did not have a destroying weapon and they stood by the altar the people should have brought their offerings sin offerings to The Altar for forgiveness of sins but now the time was over we don't want to be CAU into that so they were standing right there with their killer weapon amen so there was one that was in fine Ling was a unique man he was holding an and so when the judgement on sin is hitting the ungodly there is always the seventh man waiting to see what side you take amen and this man when you make a decision he puts a seal of protection upon you he stands right there with an eon who is on my side and if you come to the Lord side you get an amen and that Mark was the security because the man with the sword were not supposed to touch these people that have walked away from the Abominations are you out of the Abominations this morning amen he that can SE your way from the oncoming storms of judgment so the Breen alt where they stood represents sin already condemned hallelujah praise God it stands for sin [Music] already and it was judged but here was some that had rejected the forgiveness of sin are you together with the altar the Breen altar represents the Lord Jesus Christ on Calvary that he has already paid the price of getting you out of the Abomination are you together with me yes sir and the Judgment that we face is when we reject that offer when we reject the atonement and go with the Abomination come out over my people amen so brother Bram in the message listen these men stand at the altar of the church meaning that the Abominable were part of the temple are you together with they didn't stand out there in Babylon they stand here in Jerusalem and brother Bram the message Israel and the church he say brass the serpent being made out of brass meant Divine judgment now the serpent was sin already judged and Brass meant Divine judgment like the present altar the altar was made out of brass that bur the bodies of the sacrifice [Music] he says look the sacrifice I mean the altar is here but the people have rejected the Altar and they've gone their way and Destroy them he says six men that are supposed to guard the city go and bring God's judgment upon the rejectors tell your brother I want to obey the word make a confession the devil will be afraid that we are going to obey the word the good thing is that by the side of the altar there was man even in all our up to this morning there is an if you take a step away from the Abominations away from the systems of this world there is an for you God is going to seal you with the B of the Holy Ghost amen so now at this time amen when they stood at the altar the glory of the Lord was moving from the cherubims at the Mass seat to the threshold are you together with it was time no longer it was time no more like the time that we are living in say like the brother sng this morning nations are breaking everything is going way the systems of the world are failing the economy is failing in every nation the politics is chaotic religions my God Amen what does that mean that Babylon is fallen so come out over my people this call is a calling to the kingdom amen praise God yes sir the glory of the Lord was moving from the CH because God in the temple of Moses amen he sat in between the chab he was the glory that was in between the chab and at that time when judgment was coming because of the Abominations the glory of the Lord was already moving out towards the door it's latter than with amen amen so the threshold speaks of an entance to a higher level the day of was running [Music] out and so three says and the glory of the god of Israel was gone from the chab whereon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed in with L which the writers by and the Lord said unto him go through the mid of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the Abominations that are in the midst here all he says go through the city and look at the people who hate the Abominations of are you together with me we have read all of them so now this Angel is told go everywhere and watch for a man who has no joy in the Abominations of this world he says that's the one that we are going to put a Mark I call you my brother to just reject the Abominations of this and say Lord I for the Abominations that are committed in the city amen so the glory of the Lord is that the threshold to a higher OCT and on it way into the bridge that's where God is collecting his children for the Abominations and is going to keep them are you together with me yeah praise the Lord he's lifting them into Psalms 91 oh hallelujah hallelujah we are taking an OCT God doesn't want to leave you on that stage he doesn't want to leave you in the Abominations of year he wants to take you as a harvest as a token amen amen of his Redemption and take you to the bridge to stain the presence of the glory of the Lord because the glory was departing from the temple amen oh my where was it going it was going into Psalms 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I TR Hallelujah hallu this is where God want to take you under his WIS in the end time [Music] into the Messianic Kingdom to bless you together with me so the glory of the Lord is already at the thresold it is a seing time for those who are you know for the Abominations committed in the city amen are you together with me okay Ephesians 4 and verse 29 amen praise the Lord let him that St still no more I'm saying that let him that St you know somebody walks out with a laptop let him that still still come out of the Abominations sometimes you may think only a p let him St that let him steal no more but rather let him working with his the things which is good that he may have to give to him that need those small things stop stealing the Bible has said that you be be comfortable be comfortable that you also give to your friends let no corrupt Communications proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to use of edify that it may Minister Grace unto the Healer okay Abominations come out of them coming out of Babylon is not a change of churches it's more than that he says here the prophet you apply the blood and kick all trash out of and kick all the trash out of the house remove them and the house cleaning time you women take off them shorts together with me they an Abomination they don't come from the glory go they come from throw them cigarettes and you men too get all this old stuff out of the system here that is called the world if you love the world all the things of the world because the love of God is not in you when you are ready to apply the token EMP up and get ready for it together with me are you ready to take the token to pray God to send the Holy Ghost down in our lives to seal us with the he says throw everything out okay let's get back to babyon a little bit now let us understand this babyon whose Abominations they kept posting from Kingdom to another kingdom now listen in the Heen kingdoms the kings were also the heads of Heen worship are you together with me so when this King came and overcome this King he takes the king together with his gods and he adds to his God Abomination upon Abomination through the kingdoms until they come to us and they diffuse into the church are you together with the Philistines when they came and in during the time of Eli they also wanted to take the god of Israel is is not captured amen amen they said you come and take your God Amen because he's a jealous God when they put him in their Temple he slaughtered their God called dag the following that they found when had fallen AR you happy that you serve a jealous God he doesn't need anything dir in our lives it's a house cleaning time amen so now let's go and look and understand this babon Genesis chter 10 and verse eight the Bible says and beg he began to be a might one beg and he began to be might one in the earth meaning that Nim came to a time when he failed to handle his f we need to be careful when the Lord lifts us we don't fall in the weakness of nimrod he became a mighty one what does the past have to tell me he became so famous until he also decided to start his own church are you together with me become so famous he doesn't see anything good everything is bad bad upon bad amen failed to handle his Fame and verse he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore it is say even might hun before the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom [Music] was in the land of now the Bible says he was a mighty Hunter but he was not hunting them amen he was not hunting for Animals he was hunting for Regions to bring them under him the Bible says he was a mighty H in verse then in verse 10 the beginning of his kingdom are you together with me so and that's why the Bible says and the beginning of his kingdom so we now get into Genesis 11 the Genesis 11 account says that nimod instituted himself into a king the beginning of his kingdom and then later He makes himself a priest to a religion that desires to go to heaven without the word we shall uphold the Abominations and still go to heaven our women will put ones and we shall still go to heaven they will dress Cly still got heaven and this days say they say God looks at the heart but my Bible says what is in the heart is what comes out you got Proverbs 7 the bible says there was that L woman and the Bible says she was dressed in the clothes of a prostitute so there are certain clothes which don't belong to us if you are a lady and you are not married the only person that should be seeing your body is the man you are going to marry and if you are you should cover your body because it's for your husband but you put on things and you put a to [Music] this and when you go to church you car newspapers or you go with a you are cover here if you want people to see you show don't hide are you together with me praise the Lord yes sir you see so in the subsequent kingdoms as n conquered the Conquering king would take the kingdom and then they are Gods so they kept multiplying the Abominations but notti that the god of Israel as I already told you they could not be taken hostage so the the pH fa to take the instruments of God I mean uh you know Nebuchadnezzar he fa he wanted to use the instruments of the Tabernacle that he got from Jerusalem and when he did the handwriting came up from a hand and started writing many [Music] many and he trembled he wanted interpreters but the men who lived above the Kingdom Life of Babylon are the ones who had the interpretation that your put being the interpretation was you've been put in the balance and you are been found wanting and your kingdom is taken away and the Bible says he was given the heart of a beast and he left the palace and he went into the Beast I mean the field and he was eating together with beasts and God protected him from the Lions seven years so that of what the beast in the New Testament is it's not going to be an animal it's a man who has rejected the order of the word let's go to Revelation 179 and here is the mind which has wisdom the seven heads of the Beast are seven mountains on which the woman sits and here are seven Kings they counting them five have fallen and one is and the together is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space let's go to Bible teaching now amen now babyon system has been changing colors like the horse riders change colors and this system has come [Music] through by protection of political power throughout history you hear the people who speak about us we are not going to allow government these men to operate because religion power verse 11 and the peace that was and is not even he is the eth and is of the seventh and go with so this is just like is and is not is and is not just like succession a system of men that one dies and another takes is and is not so now let us look at s major kingdoms that have come through history we've got Egypt it was a mighty power that ruled the world one time they were beaten Away by Assyria and the Assyrians took the gods of Egypt there amen and then Assyria was beaten by Babylon you know we've had all these kind of Kingdoms until we come to the Pagan R so in the time of John the Apostle when he was on the island ofos the scripture says five Kings had fallen and one is which makes him six amen and then he continues for a short space but when he comes back there is a seven is of the seventh and of the e [Music] let us look at the New Testament era and the fall of the first church in [Music] Rome the New Testament Church the m Kingdom starts in the era when Rome ruled the world the Caesar you see next time I come God will give me Grace that I may parade those kingdoms as they keep coming and going so you know at that time we have the church edge of [Music] Ephesus then and then the Church of pamos when the church fell in the age of pamus some of you may not understand the foundations of the church ages I remember brother is gone to live with the Lord he says when I came to church you were teaching complicated things but my heart was telling me don't move this is the place he says just one day as I was following I broke into a superatural understanding of where you were trying to take the church and when he left us here in the 90s he went and became a foundation for the church in M amen and then his son came back to Mar brother's daughter so let's go to Revelation Chapter 2 and we see what the spirit says about [Music] pagam and to the church and to the end of the church in right this thing says he which has the Shar sword with two edges he needed to SW because in the AG of P amen there was the manifestation of the Fall Satan had taken a seat in the temple so in this edge here praise the Lord this is where the Deeds of the nians formulated themselves into do you know what the de of the nans are these are the Deeds you hear the word and you say it's right but then it should not hold on me in nature of the spirit of [Music] iniquity but you are silent about it it is a spirit that is telling you no so the Same Spirit went into the next Church age and began to question the word and the third age a doctrine of one belief to answer the doubts was established and the head was also appointed okay so in this age of pamos the Deeds of the nans formulated into doct this is when we have the great Council where they broughten the Trinity Doctrine instead of the one God and this is the same age where baptism changes from the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to father son Holy Ghost and in the same time they rejected baptism by imersive because some of the people were too important to be put in the water verse 13 he says I Know Thy works and where th dwst even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my Fai and as in the days where my faithful matter slain among you where Satan DW I'm trying to bring something that's very very important and then we lay today's service down the True Believers of PAG they held on the authority of the name and the Divinity of the faith they lived above the systems of the word at the time amen but then the unbelievers they try to kill all the truth of the world so pamos is the age which directly puts the church and Babylon together listen to what brother Bram says now up to this time I've not brought out the point in history I promise to cover that is intermingling of the religion of nim and the Christian religion are you together with me Nim believed one can go to heaven without the word anybody who dises the word and wants to go to heaven that's the religion of nimod so that kind of understanding was intermingled in the Christian church when they think you can hold Abominations and still enter the New Jerusalem he says you will recall that at loose fled from Babylon to pamos during the time of the wars between this and that soal was a king now babon under [Music] attack he fled and set up his kingdom that outside the riches of the Roman Empire it flourished over the years a succession of the priest king until the Reign ofal the this one comes then another one comes then another one just like you cannot be a king you are poor so you must be S to replace the father so it kept going like that until they came to atus the thir and for reasons known only to the sovereignity of God he took his kingdom and gave it through but he has come they are winning and then taking God now he says I'm tired of being a king throws the kingdom to the Romans Julius Caesar jar then took both the kingdom and for he became Pon Maximus Pon Maximus of the babon religion and therefore was Priest and King and we hear of P Maximus Max that was a title from a heathen Kingdom so it were thrown to Rome and then the Roman Cesar became PTI he continues to say this title passed on I mean following Emperor until the time Max refused it according to history it was then that the pop took the leip of the emperor that he rejected and today we Max the secret Myster the mighton agency the mother of all house and Abomination of the world refus to the kingdom and gave it to the Roman Catholic church and took the same title Maximus Maximus mystery he wears a triple cross he says he has power in heaven on Earth and under the Earth so in Revelation 17 God does not any longer refer pamos as sat's seat does he say that is where Satan dwells no the throne room is no longer in P it is my babon it's the Babylon mother ofs and Abominations of the Earth are you picking it and when the pur took the authority amen fromus the I mean from third I mean the Caesar the third one lots of this [Music] mysticism came and filtered into the church and people will die to prove that Jesus was was born on 25th December and when we say we don't have a meeting on Christmas they came up with a lot of things they worshiped the number of God when the Bible spoke about the father they said that's one son and then the son that's a second so now there are three the mysticism and that's what and where we are called out of we are called out of the mix of Heen culture and the Godless religion we should be careful even as we keep coming through not import the traditions of the Fallen Kingdom into the messic kingdom people come from Pentecost and they bring the traditions of pentec you know I minister in those churches I take the message to them and I want brother James Sometimes to start doing some bit of videos here to show you what we do there sometimes you go to one of these new churches they have loved your ministry when you go there there is a parade of women worship team I will not say and they come to the pastors that's where they dance then they turn like this and then when you preach you bring the word those things begin to die Abominations that have been carrying on and carrying on and caring so when we say come out of her my people you are coming out of a fallen system into the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ to be part of a Divine Kingdom so colians 1 verse amen as we finish here giving thanks unto the Father which has made us me to be partakers of The Inheritance with the Saints so we are called intern inheritance like Abraham was called inter inheritance amen so in verse 13 he says he has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear hallelujah hallelujah we are called into the church we are called out of bab to come and take our inheritance in the Kingdom of his somebody say Amen there amen and now in the Kingdom of his dear son that's where we have Redemption through his blood and then forgiveness of s that's verse 14 once we get to the kingdom of his brother let me tell you one thing we have the forgiveness of sin amen I mean we've got the Redemption and then the forgiveness of sin we are redeemed from then into hallelujah praise God from a kingdom of darkness the kingdom of Life redeemed from the wicked traditions ofon is the kingdom of so this Kingdom that we get into is the Messianic Kingdom and in that Kingdom we have the blood Redemption and then the Forgiveness of it's a kingdom that's not joined it's a kingdom where you are born into hallelujah hallelujah have you been born again have you been born into the kingdom Hallelujah those who are born into the kingdom they got their citizenship in heaven they've got their names on the Lamb's Book of Life they got the boldness to walk away from the Abominations ofon Amen in him we already have our Redemption but as we saw we may see in the journey but even then we still have the forgiveness of sin when we place our sins under the blood somebody say man again so we need to put our little Abominations that we carried with ourselves from Babylon our former religions and we put them away and we take our lives and put it under the blood the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ which speak better things than the blood of the blood of Jesus which promises you an inheritance amen so the this morning we can put all our sin under the blood and the blood that already granted us the Redemption will also continue to give us the forgiveness if we end doubt in the Abominations of Babylon this is a Messianic Kingdom where we still have the blood on the altar John says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness you are here therefore because of a blood Redemption but when you fall you have the Forgiveness of sins if we have been holding certain Abominations in our Liv then the call out ofon is loud and clear let us get the boldness to enter under the control of the blood that we can step into the Redemption and then maintain the Forgiveness of sins amen Hebrews 10 verse now of these there is no more offering for sin I want you to understand in the Old Testament they gave the atonement sacrifice year after year but now in the New Testament when the lamb he does it once am now where remission of this is there is no more offering of sin having therefore Brethren the boldness to enter into the in the blood of Jesus to enter into the rest you need to take a step into the messic Kingdom by the blood of Jesus to where our Christ the son of God the priest of our I mean of our fallen condition that's where we step into it is a finished work and Paul says when he had by himself packed our SE sat down on the right hand of the Majesty it is finished the sin is wor that's why he says when you come in you receive the Redemption every past is washed away but as you continue you make a mistake he says we still have the Forgiveness of sins so it is the finished one he did the work and set down we only need the boldness to enter into the Hol by the blood of Jesus the B Amen to throw away all the tradition of Babylon when we say come out of her it is a spiritual Kingdom from a spiritual condition of Fallen life to another kingdom the Kingdom of Light Where You Are gued by the word God bless you God bless you amen amen we receive a call into the kingdom of Messiah so next time I stand Here we are going to speak about John 14 that the kingdom is a house God bless you amen amen God bless you amen will you throw away any form of [Music] Abominations do you now understand you can be in church but still held by the Abominations of Babylon come out over my people God bless you amen
