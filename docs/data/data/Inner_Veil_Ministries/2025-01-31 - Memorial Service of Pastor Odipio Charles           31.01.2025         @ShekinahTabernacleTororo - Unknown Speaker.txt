about uh our beloved Pastor neighbor friend friend praise the name of the Lord amen if he's not yet here I can go to the next maybe the friends oh the neighbor is here hallelujah uhuh I think we shall be mixing languages [Music] here blessed be the name of the Lord I'm Pastor Musa Kenneth a neighbor from malaba Kenya and if you can permit I want to give a personal testimony uh with the pastor diio Pastor diio was a personal friend we contacted a meeting with him here in the year 2018 December together with the pastor mlof Zambia and Pastor the late Pastor K kandon of Malawi and then the next meeting we had together with him was in Malawi that was 2019 April that was the last uh I think foreign trip we had together with him in Malawi and then um uh when he began being sick we were in touch and then uh uh When I Was preparing to go to Ethiopia in the year 20 2023 March uh I had prayer items before God uh one of the prayer items I had was I wanted Pastor D to be healed and then I was praying I mean buia sorry M Uganda and then malaba Kenya so I thought he should leave more so that we can have such meetings together so I was praying and one of the prayer items as I've said before was that I wanted him healed and when I was talking to God uh about it and praying seriously before I went to preach in Ethiopia that year I received uh a communication from God and that communication was that odipo will rest in the Lord oripo will rest in the Lord oio raised in the Lord and then I as I was still wondering God gave me a scripture that I'm going to read to you uh in the Book of Revelation and that scripture you're sorry if you can [Music] permit yeah in the Book of Revelation chapter 14 verse [Music] 13 it says and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me right blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth yeah says the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their Works do follow them blessed be the name of the Lord when I receive this this I didn't know how to continue interceding but the Lord commanded me to go and to come and see Pastor I came and saw visited him at his home place uh and comforted him I told him God has spoken well of you and then he said he demanded I I tell him what God had told me I told him it was a nice nice message and then I told him I hinted to him that God gave me a good scripture concerning you and then he told me I would want to see that scripture I told him don't worry uh we will be talking and then after some time he forgot I thanked God he forgot because I could not read him this scripture while he was still there because now having known what God had for him and of course I knew he was going to rest but in the Lord I was happy myself that when he rests he rests in the Lord go bless you heart as we mourn let's know he has rested in the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord amen God bless you Pastor amen I want to invite a friend uh maybe the friends I can see here friends whether they are two or three or one uh but should be one to speak on behalf of the friends even if you come you can come as many but you escort one will speak on behalf of friends 3 minutes the friend the friends representative if you're not there then I will replace with the church representative church member amen you're welcome brother bless God bless you H this is Vincent Ura from malaba Kenya uh and I'm in law to this church I married a good lady from this church and I is racing so is a good friend of mine we could come and sit down from 10:00 until 6 it's just time that could chase us away so this is a good man and I've never experienced another Pastor not even the father of my friend there I was raised under kamat in Nairobi but this one was special he he knew how to raise his girls that's why I was attracted to one of them when I came to his office uh to ask about a girl he told me yes are you admiring to be a minister I said yes now which of the girls of you are you interested in I told him there is one that I was interested in but I think the devil is bringing another one said who is this one I told him then he removed the book in his shelf said you see this book I said yes they I have a list of my girls and I I know their character and uh this is to help upcoming ministers said what what do you mean I said for example you you tell me which girl you are interested in I said I'm interested in haret which haret I said haret sing the sister of H yes say he removed is this the one you are talking of the picture of AR said yes said but this one this one qualifies to be The Minister's Wife I said why do you say so said I have a list of them and I have to abdate me monthly and I have with them a clinic they have to update me of their lives monthly if they break and their morals and spoil their morals they have to tell me I never heard such from any other pastor of the message it was a clear a clear record I called him me I called him my spiritual father-in-law I know that that is not in English but he my spiritual father-in-law even my children call him Grandpa because he's my spiritual father-in-law I was very happy with his life uh I've been preaching here even last December he has been telling me come help my church Preach to my church I didn't know that God has raised you to that standard and you are just hiding in here in malaba should be coming always preach to us preach to my church help them then he told me you know my people the wife was a little bit far was a Elijah who was around and Ben I I didn't know whether Ben had it he said you know my people are the ones who are sorrowful this people of mine but the Lord showed me he has already shown me on the other side you heard that I was almost going I said yes the Lord showed me my portion the other side I want to go I wanted to go by that time but I think the Lord has something again for me to do a little bit I don't know what it is but the Lord showed me my portion and I want to go to possess my potion these ones didn't hear that I know they were not happy with my conversation with the old man because I could keep him there was a time I used to go to home one day he woke up and

Pastor God bless you all we shall continue working with this church I want this church to stand I told him I am ready always to sacrifice everything to stand with you I can sacrifice every month I

God knows every program whatever happens on Earth God knows everything there is no accident with God so we give thanks and we appreciate you for coming to be with us and comfort with us that even if you live here today make sure you keep on visiting us and comforting us so we appreciate you all that as we leave here we we also hope to announce that tomorrow those ones who are going for barrial we request that you register with us for those who don't have private means for going we shall get public means thank you so much uh Pastor has been very good to us and personally he has raised me from childhood right from when I was joining S1 when I was in p7 and up to this old age I've been under Pastor so he has been a very good help to us and being a child and a father you take almost the characteristics what you have been taught so we hope that what Pastor has been is what we have been leaning on and since the Gap has been created God you know has a way where there is no way so we appreciate everybody and in the church in Shina assembly the Brethren entrusted us to keep order in the church and I'm one of those who acting as a deacon in the church so I'm by names Ado Moses so with Mama I say be of good courage that's what the Bible tells us don't be in worries God knows every step in life thank you so much as I given my brother to greet you amen God bless you God bless you church God bless you rich thank you for coming I'm brother Master Robert Moses uh one of the members of Shak assembly and also a friend to our beloved Pastor CH Odio I came to know Pastor J some years back God led me to him I didn't know him that is he's a Minister but before I went to him I had received Christ in a Baptist Church so things didn't go well with me I left that place so one time two days before I met him I God gave me a scripture so as I was reading the Bible the scripture was in Revelation Chapter [Music] 2 and when I went to him that road of baz Street there was a a library so I went to him and I asked him I've read this scripture but I'm not understanding could you help me when I look at you I see you as a servant of God we entered in the office then we read the Scripture it is in Revelation Chapter 2 from verse two says I Know Thy works and thy labor and I patience and how though cast Not Die Cast not bear them that are evil and though has tried them which they say they are Apostles and are not and has form them liars and has born and has patience for my sake has labored and has has not fainted neverless I have somewhat against thee because thou H has left thy First Love remember therefore from where th fallest and repent and do thy first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove the move th Candlestick out of this place except though repent blessed be the name of our Jesus Christ it was a hard message for me I can't explain how I was a feeling before I met him but when we read this we shared with him he spoke to me he prayed for me he told me just be right is your god and honestly from that day that's when he became my friend my spiritual father and he guided me and I've been with him blessed be the name of our Jesus Christ to talk much about him we shall take a full day here but I want you to accept that he was not only a minister he was beyond a minister he was not a father he was more than a father he was not a friend only but he was more than a friend because I could just imagine what life he went through the trials and one time I told him Pastor Charice this sickness is not your test it is a test to the church to the family and most especially us the people whom you have brought to Christ it was a test otherwise I thank you for those who have stood with him during the sickness I will not name Everyone by names but Ginger thank you so much tooro thank you so much I also appreciate the someone whom allow me to say about that person he's called brother on Fred he has been so good even if he's around he could raise up his hand please wherever you get him thank him he's a person who could run these last days with Pastor to the hospital he could stay throughout the night without sleeping I really appreciate everyone may God bless you thank you for coming thank you for loving Pastor ch please let it not remain here even love the family without Pastor Deo God bless you okay thank you so much brother now we are just to leave here I just wanted to hit this point that as Eagles sometimes are threatened by the enemy and the combined Harvester is always there to harvest but then as children of God sometimes we put boundaries I am borders you don't end where you end you don't want to cross the side it is my advice that M Pastor diio has been a pastor for all of us whoever I seated here because I remember from my childhood ever since and whoever went wherever you went but I know Pastor diio is all our pastor so don't create boundary is I am for this church I'm for this Fellowship you don't want to cross that side you hate the other one you don't talk to the other one you give fingers so I request that all this binds us together because we are aiming at one point thank you so much suppose you reach that point and you have against your brother something thank you amen I only want to say Pastor D has not been a pastor for tororo only has been a pastor for the entire body of Christ he has been our pastor so God bless you I want to invite uh now uh Pastor Kimo to come and give his remarks and then after him I will hear a pastor's representative God bless you I greet you all in Jesus name uh uh before I say much let me ask the Brethren who came from across Kenya please the pastors may you stand we had a small representative to represent uh as all of you please if you don't mind the pastors you may stand the pastors you may stand and uh yeah okay now we have Pastor kunu here Pastor kunu is the pastor of kab Church that is in Bunga bless you we have Pastor Roni there Pastor Roni is the pastor of Bia Kenya for quite a long time we have Pastor Sena I don't know where is and the rest of you God bless you very much yeah you may be seed so we have just come to represent uh quite a big group in Alor we have a regional meeting of Ministers of or from 52 churches so they have all send their condolences and the award of Po and also they praying for you all of them are not able to come they are on duty and other things and then also there is a bigger group of the message of the our assemblies is about 700 and something pastors I am the patron and they have sent me with the condolences Napo and also they are praying for you especially the family God bless you very much so as I've said my name is Nelson K boy I'm station in Alor but in the body of Christ uh what we have come for is to say po to my sister the wife of brother oio I've known her for quite a long time although it has been quite some time also when we are busy in different places I think when I was here most was when Shalom I don't know whether Shalom you here yeah was a a young girl of almost half my size plus the other children now let me say that H I've known Pastoria for quite a long time from 1980s used to come to elor preached to us several times invited me to come here also several times times uh and I was here for quite some time I think while I while or when he invited me I went to quite a few churches and uh most of you know me not that I've run away but uh the Harvest is plenty and the laborers are few and that is what made us uh To Go in different directions but I still come to Uganda in fact last year I was in meetings in cang and almost all of Western almost uh crossing over to uh Rwanda but or the yeah Rwanda I think that is so we are still working together what I want to say that uh uh in those early '90s brother uh OIP was really a Budd to me he helped me to get into the ministry he is younger than me by age but older in the ministry he was an elder to me also and uh the first time that I left the country to go and preach out was when we went with him to simab in 1994 I guess all of you were born at that time and H your St actually held my hand I was carrying the books for him and we were in Zimbabwe for quite some time and uh we preach in many places in Zimbabwe he was always the first one to preach and then I'll copy I would copy what he has preach because I was still I was really a greenh horn in the ministry but uh we walk together that way until eventually he settled me in Tanzania and I went to almost every corner of Tanzania and him he went to Canada Europe and other places uh which actually agreed with this uh Ministry so when I was in Tanzania we used to communicate even with brother the late brother Peters and as many have said really was ahead of us and very useful in the ministry and I believe the work he did not many of us if we are given the same opportunity would do what he did and uh you know you you I can go to a place and take one year stumbling trying to say something or do something but Pastor D or somebody who would go somewhere and we would see the results immediately and maybe many not know him but he was a great minister of the gospel and I believe he has left behind not only his children but also his children in the Lord and great a number of his children as ministers and I believe that even though we shall miss him sorry sister because you're I mean you'll miss your husband uh because I I'm sure is somebody that you knew very well even more in the ministry than even as a friend and I believe he put a mark and this Mark will be an example to so many young ministers when I went to Kenya and concentrated there it's not that departing from here has made me to do a lot in the field or in the M there is so much to be done that even in your small corner you may think you have done a lot but what is remaining is quite a lot also so um I tried so many times to come pass by here but every time I would get information that he was in M Malo hospital and there was a time we stopped in uh Cala trying to think of how to get him we were told that uh he was a bit unwell in the hospital so after debating over some time we agreed that we let him rest but when all is said and done we thank God for such a man crossing our way he had traveled when we started a Ministry maybe the wife only knows he he was really one of the poorest I would [Music] seea but in them AA I don't think any Minister can put on aala these days I think we are very proud people brother us put you know and he preached with all that little that he had he preached hiside out he used to come to LED take services for the whole weekend and in all in all he remained a friend and not my friend only but a friend of all all the Believers I think we had to give God a lot of thanks for such a life who came and was with us and he tried to be as humble as possible for the sake of the gospel God bless you very much the church here in the BL is called Shak and uh God bless you very much God keep you the family God bless you the children God bless you don't forget the god of your father and sister don't forget the code of your husband because God used to me in several ways to bless us and I still even remember it some month up to now from 1994 so I say so many of you are born and uh I wish I had time to talk to him and tell him I'll be faithful to the end to that Ministry which he started in Me God bless you very much and uh we may not come tomorrow because of other commitments but we say God bless you and God keep you and God Stand By You amen God bless you God bless you [Music] Pastor oh I want to see him and look upon his face there to sing forever over his saving gra on the stre of Glory Glory let me LIF my [Music] voice oh my last to Rejoice God bless you amen I wanted to because everyone has something to say about Pastor CH you know praise the name of the Lord because he has pointed many souls to Calvary so everyone has has something to say about him I believe don't you have amen but now with that there is a very very great friend has come in a little late uh I will just give him this opportunity before the pastor's representative comes uh I want to invite uh former mayor Pastor Pi John to come and say something 2 minutes please please two I request you stick to it God bless [Music] you thank you so much Pastor all of you dear moners I am called opio John I have served this area as a chairman L3 in the last time of office I was the mayor I met the late when I was campaigning for the office of chairman El with Robert it would give us a lot of advice but the one most thing that I remember I was not married when I was elected a chairman el3 but he told me be careful with that office and more especially when you are relating with the opposite sectors make sure you sit in an open or public place then when I became the mayor he kept coming to my office to still guide and advice for me both while I was a chairman and while I was a may I used to move to the community locally and I would always come to [Music] him I have not seen him for some time because when my election was mingled in the last election I decided to First stay away so that I give an opportunity to the person who got that chance because I believe it was God that said let me first get to off slightly say that people can see something here maybe God wanted to save me from something like he was my engineer when I was a chairman 3 he excused himself from the council because God wanted to save him from something life is like a train some people Bor some people disembark God himself knows the moment when he brings new people to to Bard and he knows when those who are supposed to dism back dear that is why sometimes for examp example if I do a good thing and people come to fight or when I see people fighting and struggling over things that we we got on this Earth sometimes I pause and simply look at them and wonder because all these things that we got here we are going to leave them you may want to own everything but when you are being buried they will all remain you see so why do we fight is like you have a bull that bull sometimes wants to fight all the others but you the owner you look at this bull and you know when you are going to slaughter it so God knows when he's going to call us off so those who are fighting those unnecessary struggling for almost one to have everything you want to fight others you are wasting your time God bless all of you I thank God so much that he enabled me to be around CU otherwise I would have missed this opportunity to see my friend off God bless all of you for God and my country thank you than you very much uh brother uh praise the name of the Lord I want to invite uh pastor's represent representative to speak on behalf of the pastors and then thereafter we shall have uh uh now to hear from the family praise the name of the Lord to hear from the children and the rest and praise the name of the Lord pastor's representative please uh God bless you Pastor as you come to speak on behalf of the pastors God bless you so much amen God bless you Brethren uh on behalf of my fellow pastors before I say anything maybe let me request all pastors who are here to stand up for recognition if you know you are a pastor you should not be ashamed God bless you so much in your capacities thank you for coming you may be se you know have been given a short time to say something well Pastor depio Charles has been a unique man I first met him in 1975 when we joined rooh High we were actually the Pioneer [Music] students who admitted by the government that time he was still he was a preacher I was the tiniest man would see him preach and we would get scared because in 1975 to be God preaching salvation meant either imprisonment or death that time the government had only allowed four religions Orthodox Catholicism Anglican and then Islam would watch him preach fearlessly as a small man after that after we parted our ways the last the next meeting was in 1987 when we met now in the message at that time there was a library in Kenya under the late pastor oena and I was the one responsible of smuggling book message books from Kenya Cross to Uganda by head and sometimes by bicycle that was a wonderful time that's when I knew that ripio Charles was a a real man of God the third incident again was in 1990 you know there was biting poverty in Uganda and I decided to go to campala to look for a job and I got a job on my return back to pick my family I got a message from Brother Charles calling me to come and see him and when I came he narrated to me a story of the prophet Jonah after giving me a story I I enjoyed the story so much then he turned and told me you are Jonah I asked him what what have I done he said you are the Lord showed me when you are running to cala said God has chosen you to be a pastor in that place I said but we have brother Seto he said go has removed set already I went back a Broken Man hearted man because looking at my family the poverty the needs it was too much but I sat back I listened to him who was I to disobey the voice of God uh let me say something again about how brother Charles was special we received some visitors from westca Africa some two brothers and we had a meeting at Elon view those people gave us gave gave him a proposal that if he can abandon what was preaching and take their version of taking the message would forget of poverty I remember he said never we cannot do that we cannot sell the truth for a piece of bread that proves to you that he was a man of integrity fast forward on 27th of November 2024 when I paid him a visit with brother Julius we had a memorable time we were sharing those old days [Music] he asked me how old are you I told him I was 68 and I asked him what about you how old are you brother he told me I don't know my age said maybe my wife knows then the sister came in and reminded him the day he was born then I said oh brother I'm older than you by two months then that was when he informed us that there will be meetings here on the 7th and on that 7th when we were here after the service he came here and stood and he [Music] said telling the church to respect every minister who will come to this place those words stuck to me and on the way back I was telling brother Julius you know brother Julius the brother though he has lost memory what he said there carries a lot of weight I went back home sat and thought so much about those words that statement and then finally I came to the Gospel of John chapter 15 verse 11 you will read at your own time it was a command from the Lord to love one another you see Brethren brother Charles pastored most of us when I came from Kenya he actually became my pastor and a [Music] mentor today as pastors we are meeting here he has gathered us [Music] together is the one who has called for this meeting that we should meet [Music] you know there may be so many things that have kept some of us apart but let us remind ourselves that that is the work of the devil there is one thing I'm sure of that it takes only love to put us in that place we bre that we are going to my prayer is as ministers let us drop all our ODS and recognize one [Music] another that in a house there are diverse vessels you may be having a bigger Faith than Aura you may be having a bigger congregation than Aur you may be able to bring a message in such a tremendous way that everybody listener gets worked [Music] up but let us not forget that in that very house there is also a pot break for you maybe metal my last word is brother Bram talked of one Abraham would make about 10 loots the faith of Abraham was greater than the faith of who lot and brother Braham said if you are a pastor of five souls in the sight of God you are not [Music] less than that Pastor who has a Congregation of 1,000 people before God you are a Shepherd if you have been avoiding abura let us meet and say from today my brother you are my brother if you avoid to greet me you are still my brother and there is one thing that I will request as fellow pastors to remember sister chario she has been a mother to all of us she cooked for all of us she served all of us water for bathing tea meals in this trying moment as we shall be going back to our homes to our congregations let's sit down and think about her I learned a lot from the meetings that I've been attending ministerial meetings in Kenya those pastors across don't forget of the Widow may the Lord bless you and forgive me for taking your time [Music] [Applause] Shalom God bless you Pastor B that was so great we need clap for him again and that is the message that I call the message praise the name of the Lord and that's what he preached and that's what he stood for let us respect that praise the name of our Lord humbly uh thank you for that was great testimony uh from 75 it was a great journey and God is not ready to lose any any of us the long journey he has traveled with with us God is never ready to lose any of us God bless you so much uh with that said praise the name of the Lord we shall sing Just A Chorus of all I want to see him and look upon his face as I invite the children uh to come and say something want to hear from the children amen I know you are strong you know the words of dad kept telling you be strong all right amen praise the name of the Lord and uh then after them we shall hear uh from the grand children and then we shall hear from the in-laws and uh Uncle Sam will speak for mji amen I hope Uncle Sam is around praise the name of the Lord uh so that is the order and then there after we shall invite maybe the word has to be given enough time the word from God Amen let us say as as I Journey Through the land singing as I go pointing s to Calvary what do we do do the FL many arrows many arrows pierce my soul from without within but what but my Lord leads me home through him I must win let know oh I want to see see and look upon his face there to sing forever alling Grace on the streets of Glory let me LIF my voice car fast and home at last [Music] to amen God bless you our want to hear the children speak amen you can come come come my brothers sisters come come I'm here I'm part of you I'm the eldest son amen God bless you brother Ben Elijah God bless you be strong and of good courage I'm with you here amen we want to see him and sing of his H Grace amen God bless you God bless you [Music] Church we're here to as as was saying we're here to celebrate life of Pastor Charles who is also our father biologically there is a lot which can be say about him it's not it's not something you can say within a short frame of [Music] time all in all dad was a a strong personality he was a farm man and you don't to him especially when he knows what he's saying is right and grounded in the message you'll never TOS him I don't I don't care how much scientific proof you will bring or whatever you will not toss him and that was a firm base for all of us especially in the Christian walk personally we have you've heard of stories of people wanting to come and bribe him to bring in other things we W witnessed it personally uh even if to some of them would make him sick like I remember one time after heed argument the following that he was in hospital pressures and etc for because of some people wanting to allow him to preach a false Doctrine and he gains financial wealth that and I witnessed it myself but he refused and that one struck a good seed which is a legacy by God's grace we have to keep hallelu another thing he was he led by example he's not a person who could [Music] pretend you know when when a person is pretending you just wait for them in their lonely hours or or whatever but I I watched daddy though he was he would not know sometimes but we watched him even out of sleep or you see his kind of maring scriptures or something when he was sick many times a brother Maybe come to visit him and of course maybe in the art of trying to divert him from his condition you begin talking other things he just does off but when you begin preaching the word of God or sharing a testimony you see him waking up or singing a song from his sleep I I used to watch him but from far I would not I would watch him from far but not talk anything and I was wondering he's only interested in God things but other things is dozing off or it doesn't show any interest when you was sick whatever Hot Topic you would bring maybe things like news current events as long as he knew would help him in the message there he would follow up but if you bring in any funny music or you just see him losing interest [Music] and when he was sick in hospital in mulago of course sometimes he not himself you know sometimes when a person is not himself you you speak out exactly who you are if you a terrorist you will begin speaking words of I will blast you with bombs here if you have ever been a terrorist when you're going through those sick hours but the words I would hear from Daddy was Hallelujah take what you have but give me scriptures such things now that one is not somebody who is pretending that one is a genuine person and he he didn't only do it once he did it many times so for [Music] me that is a fir story which I think we have to preserve that Legacy God bless you okay God bless you I believe all of us are creation of God so I can call you Sons and Daughters of God otherwise I appreciate your coming I'm the Third born Benjamin odipo and what I can say humbly about my father is that uh he has been both a physical and spiritual father in my life and one thing that would really attract my attention was that in spite of his influence and uh the great ministry that he had is someone who would even encourage the one who is at the bottom who is still Rising he would show you so much respect and encouragement uh actually he's the one who has been my mentor when I was a minister of course I'm a minister of the Gospel but of course not an old minister of the Gospel I'm still I'm still new in the [Music] field uh God bless you Pastor and uh I feel so sad that he went early do was doing a very good job in my life but uh whenever I would preach he would always encourage me and respect the sermons I would Minister so that one would really humble me and I would say if with my small Ministry this kind of Pastor can speak this concerning my life then I think that's the right path I have to follow you don't be someone who wants to be a show off in Ministry but like our pastor was saying you may be what you may be a leaf you may be a branch or you may be a root but you all a part of the tree amen and there's no one who is greater than the other so God bless you all and continue praying for [Music] us God bless you um Moses the youngest son I will just say a few things about Dad uh I remember some of his sermons he believed in Simplicity and he always thought all is well no matter the situation and he was uh he was faithful to God was a St Christian and I think he was a m to many people may his soul rest in glory [Music] [Music] the Lord bless you all um Joseph adipo the fourth born um these are hard times to speak because uh the pain of losing him is one that we cannot bear I like to say what Comforts us from the testimonies when he's departing and his life he has lived is that he's in glory and if we are faithful till the end shall meet him I like to say he he lived a Christian Life most importantly about that one thing I recognize with him is even when he had external battles you could not know his enemies he was someone who never wanted you to talk ill about anyone else you know as a child sometimes you witness s circumstances in life and you may M here and there that he always wanted us to be peaceful he always wanted us to love each and everyone like Jesus said do good he also had father in love and according to the scriptures the Bible says Those whom I love I Chas so he was a strict father he did not want us to go the wrong way he always wanted us to be right and I know myself personally growing up I was on the stubborn side but I always tell myself if I did not have him as a father maybe I would have been worse than I was but he was strict he cared for us he sacrific the Lord for our lives and where we are today it's because of him so thank you all for coming here to celebrate him I like to say that his life has left a footprint SS of time and we are blessed to have him the Lord bless [Music] you God bless you all first of all I would like to start by saying thank you to everyone who has been there for my dad financially spiritually emotionally may God bless you all may God reward you there's so much to say about Dad my siblings have Sav all but I always remember dad preaching love we Face hardships personal I when I'm with him I would tell him some of my hardships and he'll just say just love stay in love love love conquers all and don't forget to pray don't forget the family prayer that's always always what I teach my children that song don't forget the family prayer dad is resting it's very hard for us but he's in a good place I'll miss him I remember before I left hospital I left him fine before I could cross the road mommy calls me and says Daddy's going I don't know how I reached back there I don't know how I reached but uh he's in a good place and may I always stay in love and always practice forgiveness it is what will keep us strong God bless you let us sing this song It Is Well with My Soul as the children go back and then we shall hear from the grandchildren can you clap for them please that was wonderful testimony and I thank God for the grace that they were all strong I thank God for the pastor he had a real strong

amen um I am not going to speak as a son-in-law and you have heard people say it's one thing he not is more than a father more than a pastor and more than everything I am going to say my own personal uh Memorial of him the first time I saw him when I met him my Fondest Memories of him I think should be about 9 [Music] 1989 and we used to live at g Road and he used to come and stay at our home whenever he would have when he was moving West or when he was moving out of the country he would stay at our home uh it was the first time when I got to know him uh as a little child I was probably I don't even remember that could have been around maybe P maybe P4 I don't remember so what I recall is that whenever he would come home we used to have different names for different people would refer to a person without you knowing who the person is we used to have a people called the uncle with beards the uncle with specs but we used to know him as uncle or de for some strange reason so when he comes we would go and play with him the whole night in his bed he would not sleep would be with him until late until our parents Chas us out when I look back it appears I have a picture of him of open love open love for everybody I want to show you how it worked in 20 in 1993 when I joined senior one at St Peter's College tororo the church was in Toro girls I would walk from St Peters if you know where it is I was possibly 12 years I would walk from that place up to Toro girls every Sunday uh how did it happen when I the memories of 19 1989 I heard that he was a pastor here so I looked for him and when I reach church he would leave everybody he would pay I saw him pay attention to every person that was in church I used to wonder how he would do it and me at my age he would call me by name and he would ask me when are you going let's go home and I was not saved I remained going to that church for 5 years without getting saved but I was going to church can you imagine I was moving long distance to church without getting saved the time when I went to get saved the church had something had happened so I left the church I went back to scripture Union I think there was a new doctor that came so the pastor I asked the pastor what happened I realized he was not happy with what was going on he was a man of Peace he always loved place of Peace he loved he hated Discord I don't know where that thing came from I was told it was a new doctrine of shouting and things so after some time I rejoined with him again and I realized that the church was peaceful again now my memories of him in 1989 when I tried to get any other I remember a person holding his Bible in one hand and he used to have a [Music] briefcase and he was either head he was always going somewhere to preach and I remember always escorting him from the house with his I would hold the Bible and give it to him at the gate I don't know why those kind of memories remained with me now let me tell you he didn't leave me he continue to visit me even when I was working that's just to show you who this person is even when I got to work he came and visited me at my house then he looked at the house then he said oh this is very nice only one thing is missing in this house house you can imagine what it is then it didn't take long it was now when he spoke like that I think a year later he got to know that I was going to bring that thing that was missing in my house I was working I was having a house I was having almost what need but one thing [Music] was I don't know what it was of course at the end of the day I turned out as they said earlier on a son-in-law but I must say for me I think I'm a son in love to him he loved me I had him in my house I think we've been for over 4 years while he was [Music] battling we used to talk as men a lot of things the things he would tell me not to make my brothers jealous I don't think he discussed them with his children I think he loved many people who came around him just like the way he loved his family I I don't know how that happens but I experienced it I believe he was a man on a mission and he has accomplished his mission he's in a good place the Lord has welcomed him he has done his work very well I was talking with my father and my father told me that every place in this country has his footprint of work yesterday I was talking to somebody he called me and told me he could not make it but he told me that he has never seen actually after talking about him he talked about my mom-in-law and said he doesn't think there is a woman like that in the whole world that is only one I said why he said that she spent her time taking care of other people so much more than even her own family that's why I agree we must see a widow in the proper perspective and we should not leave a WI Widow alone the Widow belongs to us we ate all her food we we did everything in her house if you see what she lacks it's because we took it we took whatever she lacks now we took it so it is time to pay back it's time to pay back it's time to return home we go back home Hallelujah God bless you God bless you son in love amen we appreciate Brother Sam amen praise the name of the Lord now I want to invite Pastor George KUSI the father-in-law to our brother Elijah is [Music] speaking on the sun side as an in-law to the sons God bless you Pastor not yet okay then we can go shall continue with the program I will now uh have to [Music] invite Richard via yes she he's the one I was going to invite Uncle Richard to come and speak uh on the family of the

Uncle Sam he didn't come okay praise the name of the Lord the brother to the deceased brother y Joel you're welcome to come and speak uh praise the name of the Lord we are here to celebrate the life I remind you again the life of Pastor our friend Father Charles [Music] O amen God bless everyone moners I would like first of all to appreciate everyone who has come for this last moment and it's not an easy task uh physically but spiritually I believe that as the preacher was saying we have come to celebrate I know it's a hard time for the we the family members um just want to make an brief introduction my name's um Pastor Joel aoma I'm the last born of Pastor Charles oio and also I also like to first of all thank God for the ministry I remember he preached this message when I was still I used to see him preaching when in 1970s when I was still in [Music] primary uh but of course uh I was still young I did not understand but he could go to schools and preach into some schools and I could see him lining up all the seven Church Ages which I have never had in my life before uh but uh that's when I started hearing about this message Pastor uh brother our late now char I wanted just give him the brief uh background he was born on 21st January 1957 in West Nile West Nile is formerly it was AR District but now the place the location is in zumbo District was born in zumbo District in a village called araka Village and uh that's when he was born from that Village and I can say biologically the home district is called zumbo District that's why our ancestro home is and that's why our dad also was buried our father is called L Gideon amango he died and he was a lerer is a a preacher in Protestant church with the you tell me he had the first letter second letter third letter so he's El in Protestant church [Music] and when he became a l reader my dad because uh he's my biological brother and uh his wife that's our mother biological mother is called late Rebecca at tomaru these are Protestants and uh the biological Brothers of chipio were the ones our daddy had six boys two girls and those are eight children but out of this uh three boys died including himself then one of our sister also [Music] died and um we have remained three boys one girl now Pastor chario my biological [Music] brother he started his primary education in masindi District but I wanted to bring down how did he come to M from West Nile the people in buoro we had our tribes almost two subc count in Marini District our trib mates who speak local language so they wanted a preacher who could come and preach them in the local language so the The Boro people the Protestants especially they wrote to ROR dasis to request a preacher from West Nile to come and preach the word of God to buoro to the local people and the vote landed on my dad so they wrote a letter to my dad that is Gideon amango was a preaching Protestant they say you have been chosen to go as a missionary Ino from West n to buoro as a preacher to your people to preach in the local language my dad refused he said he can't go Boro they gave him another scripture that when Jonah refused to go to NV what happened to him that scripture hit him up and told his wife that's our mom that let us go because it's the work of God then they had to travel from West Nile together with his wife they travel through Lake Albert using a ship and crossed the lake up to buoro in a village called Nanton and it's from there that uh my dad preached the word of God to many villages and and people opened many churches and from there that also Char shipo started his primary education late Charles oio started his primary education in 1968 he completed in 1974 and he passed highly in grade one and was admitted in cabala s that is masindi district and his place later was replaced by rich man who brought his own son in his place then our elder brother the first born called Mata Alex is is there that's the first born uh of chario he was a clerical officer by then he was working here in toroto hospital he had to bring Charles oio in toroto and fix him in Rock High SS that's why he started uh studying and uh it's from there that he believed this message he got this message when it was already in toroto and um when his elder brother blasto was transferred to to another place in KAG then that's when he left charp he said let us go together said no I have my people near here I can stay with them you can go to kagadi me let me remain in too and started from there he could preach in different places as you have the testimonies and uh he remained here eventually uh he become the pastor here in tororo he completed his uh education from here and he started also becoming a pastor in this place because during his lifetime he has been preaching throughout um after completing his education he opened up churches church called salom Tabernacle thereafter uh I started another chart later which is called seina assemblies he has been an elder and every very active Pastor in the ministry he was among the first pastors who believed this message and traveled from missionary work preaching in Uganda and outside countries mentioned but few many people believed his ministry and churches were opened in different places uh later because I'm to be very brief now later became sick and had a long time sickness uh until he passed on but I like to appreciate all those who participated supporting him in the ministry supporting him in the sickness um and also in transport physically spiritually and also uh in many things that had made him to reach up this moment of time on behalf of the family members of our late father Gideon amango that is our late dad I also like to thank him that also what he participated in the faith of my D who believed the message at the last moment and he was baptized in tororo here when he was already a Protestant preacher then he believed the message he was baptized when he was baptized the Protestant says your daddy is our dadd is lost but my daddy could say one thing what you eat enters your stomach so what have received is assisting me but not you people who said I've joined the ministry of my children so that's how we could always speak like that and our families were Christians and look like missionaries and I also thank God when I visited him here in toroto I met Pastor Myra in his home and he participated also in the preaching in my life he preached to me I used to ask him many questions and he went there after shortly I I just told Pastor Charles that I want to get saved and I believed the message from Toro also thank God it's from there in this place I got my wife and and uh I just wanted them to come here my my wife and my children they around here that's the seed my children are ministers they're all preachers in the gospel of this message you can come quickly here and my wife because that's one of the fruits of the ministry in this place amen so there coming is the first Bor followed by the SEC second Bor that one is the third Bor and uh the last Bor is I think is not here but he went somewhere he abroad that the Beloved wife that has brought up this children and uh I thank the mother of this my my Bri my rib for bring up also her daughter where is that where is that sister she's out and uh that is the one who has brought her this wife of mine and has brought very good children and he's a pastor a now he a he a minister he just a minister he just a minister they are all medical personnels uh finally maybe just briefly within one minute I want my my eldest brother to stand up you can come here with your wife I think these are all closest people who have come there is not going to anything just to see them you can stand up and your

amen now I want to invite Mama Ruth uh the wife to the decease to come and at least speak something about her best I think you permit me for that then afterward I want Pastor IAL to come and he's the one to usher in the minister we are in time I think we have come for that let us bear uh excuse us where we have uh had some shortcomings but the Lord permitted it and God knew it will be like that are you Believers then believe it God bless you amen [Music] go God bless you all I would have not spoken but if I don't speak about him when will I testify about him again because I know him more than everybody Charice has been really a husband and more than a husband he got me when I had lost my father when I was young but he played the part of a father he loved me with all his life the first thing he would call whenever he reaches at home he would say wa me and all his life even when he was he has been my example I am what I am because of him I'm a kind lady a masterful lady true a simple a simple lady a lovely lady and I'm not a bitter person I don't hold [Music] bitterness just because I saw my husband leave it he does not allow us to sit and discuss about somebody even when he's his enemy and even when things are hard whenever you would ask him what are we going to do he would always say don't you trust God God will do it amen throughout all his this sickness I we never heard him complain even asking God why am I sick or why am I going through this P he has been a lovely person he loves everybody sometimes he could tell me he comes late at night and tells me I met a drunkard staggering on the way I had to hold him his hand and help him to escort him he lived that really a life which was challenging even but before he got sick he told me he Dreamed a Dream he had crossed over and that land was very beautiful and when he looked at himself he found he was full of stars he did not want to come back but he was told to come back he has been a great friend for me he has been encouraging me and when even things are hard I would look at him I say but this one is also a human being like me but if he can bear and does not complain who am I to complain he has been my example my friend does not talk bad about me I don't think anybody has ever had him complain about me he has always called me a good wife so he has loved my people with all his heart Charles loves everybody he really a person of love and patience I could testify he would be a very rich man because he would come and tell me what people promises him if he only believed the way but he would not do that we went through hardship but he will toate and still love his God he loved his children his family we cannot say that he loved this child more than the other one he loved them the same he loved us he wished the best for us only didn't have much but sacrificed the little heart for us there is even a time he could put one pair of shoe for a long time but to see his family okay he allowed the children to take the courses they want whether they are expensive he did not want toct to dictate for them that maybe does not have much he will struggle to pay the school fees yet he had friends who were promising him even one time he told me one showed him many good cars told him your car is old if you only believe the way he believes allows he would have the best car showed him many types of nice cars but my husband never did that at home everybody a v comes he will not go want anybody to go without testing anything that one I knew it even because when the visitor is wanting to say I'm going he will say you wait they are preparing something for you even without knowing whether I'm prepared all things are there to prepare but I also L I knew that V would not go until I S because he will hold him we have been together it is painful that's why you see me cry because he's a great friend he became my father became my twin brother he became everything to me I miss him but God is Grace because he has been even telling people I would love to go but I fear to leave my wife because he knew the closeness we had I thank God he has left an example because even when we married the first thing he did to me is to introduce me to read the Bible would read the Bible every day and even in his sickness has not left that the morning when he would call go and call him he says I'm still [Music] praying at night he made sure we always have a family prayer it has been a challenge one time even a certain lady came at the gate and he told me is this a the home of Pastor I said which Pastor do you want he just told me she just pushed me you don't ask those questions she entered but my husband received her as if he has ever known her before he does not say refuse people whether they are Muslims they have been coming at home home there saying what a simple man he loves us even when we are low is not our leaders there they only associate with big people but this one is a man of people even cholas he would have gathered much for himself but he was somebody who was not selfish whenever he sees somebody need he helps he gives away this was really a life too we thank God we tried our best but I thank I thank the family they also loved him I remember there's a quote the prophet said you were blessed if you help your parents because they helped you when you were you could not help yourself I thank God that my children have been there we left everything we said you want to see that okay my son left even the work he has been there for his father I thank him for that heart I only pray because he has been talking about love he wanted a United Family a lovely family may my children take that example let nobody come between you love hold yourselves together never despise the you a friend because he doesn't have much and you have more when you see you have much help the one who does not have to lift him up always stay together maybe one day I may not be there to guide you but you know I already speak love I already speak love for you and and I always long to see you peacefully and lovely never divide yourselves stay together and take keep the name of Daddy I know he's gone we have been discussing we thought he would stay and maybe we go together in the Rapture but it has not happened he has gone before I know is waiting though it was painful he always said I would have loved to go but I fear to leave my wife because he knew how close we were we really loved one another it was not a pretended love it was a begin love one thing I never even packed my bugs that I'm running home I think my people testify and I've never even start to complain about him and whatever we went through difficult the mountains the thing we were always stuck together when we were paying school fees of our children we will pay all yet we even go first when we had some challenges come back take our D and peacefully but lovely I'm a person who does not want to ask much to expose what we I'm going through because I always believe God if he wants me to get something he will get for me and also I love to do things but I learned from my husband when you the right gifts don't allow the left to when I help I enjoy to help in secret I don't want to show off just like my husband was he was a dad to me God bless [Applause] [Music] you God bless you Sister Ruth God bless

love God amen amen I welcome Pastor I to come and speak God bless you uh maybe before he speaks please bear with us I know there are big people here the government officials I want to take this moment to recognize them uh we know you will forgive us because of time too many of us have to speak because the pastors from Kenya came here about eight of them they traveled all the way from Kenya each one

for turning up for the memorial service of our pastor brother Charles I want to welcome brother kemboy and the team from Kenya it's a big sacrifice for you to be here and when I look around I see that all of us are offsprings of the ministry of the man that lies in in state [Music] now [Music] um I was celebrating thinking I'm the one who knows brother Dio longest here but I've been beaten by brother [Music] orra brother [Music] Charles can only be defined Ed by love he a man who did whatever he did simply because he believed that's what represented the word I remember in 1978 I was a young Pentecostal believer and uh I was so much zealous in winning souls for the Lord we were staying in campala then but I believed that Ginger I mean [Music] tororo you know needed the light I didn't know why but I strongly believed I should go to tororo and testify of the goodness of the Lord I spent here about one week that was in 1978 and then as I had my Bible in the hand and I was moving back and forth in casoli area I met a little group of about 15 people and they were having Fellowship the man who was there was Senor in age this is a man who moved all the way from Malawi to come and testify of this message they used to call him P Philly and he was raised under the ministry of mson bosy whom brother Bram speaks about the little he knew he stood for it and when I entered that house they told me you are welcome speak to us that was 1978 I opened my Bible to the book of Samuel and straight I went on the story of Eli a priest with deeming eyes I preached my heart out and after I sat down a young man in a cat Shir with Tire shoes stood to my face and said unto what were you baptized it was a very interesting question I tried the best I could to defend the Trinity but I was beaten and then I said I you people who follow weam Bram they said no we don't follow him I said didn't he say we were going in the Rapture in 1977 they told me no he didn't say that so I asked what did he say they gave me the seven Church age book brother Charles oio gave me the book and says go and read this book [Music] and when you come to finishing this book let us meet again I spent a week I read the book over I spent the day in the book The Night in the book and then when I came to the spot I didn't see that brother Branham prophesied he said I predict and he repeated it several times so I went back and I said I have seen what you people say then they said we are not going to discuss more take this book and read this one also then we can be able to kind of have a wider discussion they gave me the seven seal book h and I read it in one week when I came back I didn't have questions I said I believe where is the [Music] water the streams were dry and we followed a little stream somewhere in tororo where I don't remember until we find enough water to cover a person I was baptized by Brother Charles [Music] oo so when people talk about where the message began from we were not part of the Jerusalem which was from tesso college after some time we were introduced to the older brothers brother John oiso here Brother Martin Tom who is in Canada now and brother MTI that were in trog girls and that's how we came together in Fellowship years later brother Charles became the pastor of that fellowship and I want to say all of us who are here have been helped in one way or another by his ministry he was honest with whatever he said there was no shars when brother CH talked to you if he said no he meant it very well I want to remember one scripture in Proverbs 18:24 which says that a man that has friends must show himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother brother Charles was not only a brother to me he was a friend I always tell my children when you find a friend never lose him never lose him so I thank God that he was not only a brother he was a friend he always followed me up until I was able to separate from Pentecost and then one of my first disciples was brother Ben namag goia if you can stand up [Music] we were close and we preached everywhere they called us the Trinity and we accepted it so you know I was always checking on him and many years we moved together and uh a friend will always love you despite your weaknesses that's what we call a friend that is brotherly kindness brotherly kindness is not a Doctrine but a practical life experience that every one of us is supposed to exercise brotherly kindness doesn't tell you to love me because I'm a good person brother Bram says even when a brother is All Out Of Tune Express that loved that brother his brotherly kindness you know I love David he's a man who expressed brotherly kindness you know and it's what gave him the kingdom during his training on the backside of the desert he was looking after sheep he got all kinds of several challenges there he was attacked by a bear that he tore and killed he saw a sheep I mean a lion invad his ship and I tell you he tow that lion to Pieces then one time as a shepherd of God's people God was proving that man he ends up getting out of the Battleground to take his brother's food and found a giant gorth challenging the armies of the Living God he stood and said who is this uncircumcised Philistine that's challenging the armies of God they didn't believe him but he was anointed the true anointing is not physical manipulation either it's uh real scream or is supreme power under control and it was holding David in it is something that was brewing up deep down into his seed Jin so said let's try this gift he got five stones and brought down the Giants he slw gath so but you know brother [Music] kindness brought de to the kingdom after that the church recognized his gift the anointing that he already received by Samuel the women sang the church David has killed his thousands but Saul has killed his hundreds so became so jealous still brother carness was called to be put up on this plan so tried the best he [Music] could to kill David but David had supreme power under control because of Brotherly kindness he was avoiding the wrath of Saul in the mountain down in The Valleys one day he was tempted to return some stuff and he cut the HM of Soul's garment it hurt him so much that was brother Charles O he would feel so bad if he said something nasty about a brother he would say I've lost my peace David had what we call brotherly kindness brotherly kindness has got the ability to hide your potentials to Har it takes it under control that even if you are angry sometimes we may think we can get angry on behalf of God just like Levi did and Simeon then they went and almost killed the wall of sim Jacob was not happy he said in the land separate them and when Joshua got into the land he separated them he could not put them close to one another because because if you join together to do harm the next thing when there is nobody to harm you are going to harm each other Jacob says separate them so even after David become king because that was the last thing he did brotherly kindness to bring down charity to cap down his kingdom even when he became king he was still tested on the grounds of Brotherly kindness he just felt like Saul is dead I don't want people to think that I've got some kind of anx to grind against the family of Saul then he says is there any that is left of the House of Saul that I may show him the kindness of God he says on my own I canot if there is any kindness left is the kindness of God if we can let The Virtuous Life of Christ mold us the angers the history let it [Music] die we are all a product of brother CH or the ministry that's the brotherly kindness that charity will desire to see you so brother Charles oio was not only my pastor but a friend and a friend does not allow the codes of friendship to [Music] break all of us should have been the first people to come when we hear that a j GI of Faith Among Us has rested we would put our hands together for the purpose of the cause I'll remind you one thing God told Abraham that put away the son of the born woman he cannot be here with the son of the promise but can you imagine ishma that was going and crying and you know the mother put him aside because she thought he would die when Abraham died in Genesis [Music] 25 ishma came and participated in the funeral of his father who put him away I want to speak to the churches here that we are not in competition in the ministry we are not in competition whatever the Lord allows you to do do it with a basis of love just maintain the legacy of this young man who has rested he's young because he has broken the barri of time he's 18 [Music] now to celebrate his legacy that has benefited all of us let the acts for don't hold the acts no more we are a Brotherhood God bless you thank you for coming and being part of this I pray the Lord blesses [Music] you I just want to say one more time we are not in a popularity contest everybody has got a little part God has given to him let us be faithful to that and that's what God will reward God bless you God bless you so much in humility I want to invite brother James musaka who has worked also extensively with brother uh Charles oo to come and seal up the day with someone brother you [Music] Brothers thank you for showing us your love and coming over brothers from Kenya God bless you God bless you brother chud brother John you know many years together and uh I trust God will bless you just keep that Brotherhood that's all we can do you see Heaven is not my Doctrine it is not my Doctrine which takes me there is the personal relationship with Christ that life hitting the seed J and transforming it you see you shall never know everything we shall never see everything together you know Peter didn't know what Paul knew but both of them were Apostles and saint of God let us be a body God bless you [Music] God bless you so much um I want to thank God that I've got this opportunity to come and be together with you over the issue of the departing of our precious [Music] brother uh if it is the preaching then we have heard the sermons okay what the Brethren have [Music] testified they have revealed to us the work of Christ in a person and that's what we are looking for on this Earth I want to appreciate the family for the grace God has given you to stand all these prees that you never know the process could have been what the situation to be what it is but in life it's not good to choose another person Paul told us we must appreciate God in [Music] everything we are that's something we should not forget in life as we go this journey we need each other and one of the worst thing the devil can do he finds people walking together for a common cause and he breaks that [Music] Fellowship to me I've experienced that that is the worst thing that we can have appreciate the pastors who have come here the from Kenya we have been with brother k for quite a long time now is the way got lost from him and here besides [Music] him uh this is Pastor [Music] Sam it's the brother who led me to this message when I was a Pentecostal Pentecost uh here also I have my pastor Ben who took a very big part in my life and the other Breen who are here God bless you so it is there is a need we can't pretend there is a need and when I see of God like P stepped so much into the problems of brother Charles [Music] CH the family knows we know it we need at this crucial hour men and women of God to join hands with him there is a big gap which has been left to stand together for the [Music] family and church during during funerals we speak good and promise and when we go back homes we forget about it but at this time remember we are believers let us forget about what divided us because the devil and come back for the right cause there's a lot of love which has been spoken about a brother I'm one of them during very difficult times of the I I stayed in his house sister would cook for me he would receive me and talk with me and encourage me I thank God for him did not only have love was a man oft one time he told me he was crossing the border at thenc supect was a wrong of the Innocence he had how are you when he did it this people started qu started fear oh it's okay you can go actually is a man who put himself very low time after preaching he went baptizing went home and there was no food God touched one man he carried a big bag of when he was after preaching he had a thir somebody falling outside just to discover the man went home he said something told me to bring this to the one time he was preaching in my church there was anly brother who was not coming to church for a while when he had his sermon he received something special was so happy the whole of that week and that's the week that to with for when the Bible talks of footsteps of the rightous being ordered of the lord we have it our brother maybe without wasting time tired let's read a scripture and I say something little and then I hand over second Corinthians chapter 4 the Bible says verse 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward Manish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affli wa but for a moment work for us a far more exiting and eternal weight of Glory while we look praise God verse 18 while we look not at the things which are seen the things which are not seen things which are seen are temporal the things which are not seen are Eternal let's pray precious father we thank you for the scriptures we have read Lord you know very well I am not the best among your Ministries but it has fallen my Lord are children who need you know how to do it through your own way speak through a man and encourage your children encourage when we hear moving statements from these ministers and from brother we know there's something that has happened something has touched them it is something that has moved us out of our position that our brother rest give us also the peace let's focus on that our brother is at home Inus name amen may God bless you as amen amen so this is something for us to know to think about ourselves here and there see the love of God which has done for us that according to the scriptures to Apostle PA and others we are not crying like people without hope God gave us the hope and this is the time to know that what God has put in our hearts is greater than other physical things he has to us come to stressful moments there is something that can hold us and I believe in this world there are many things that have been given to people there are many great names great works great discoveries great powers that people have achieved but I want to say this the most important thing of all that when Jesus saved us he put something in our soul don't just talk about it on our lips we experience it and actually as our brother has said love is not just as someone preached something talked something that is just read but the love of God the presence of God in our lives come and stand for us when we cannot stand the prophet says that you should have sweetness towards your enemy that's not a the those are not statements a life he spoke of what he lived and we are supposed also to speak what we live is that's why when you have not gotten that experience of God in your heart even difficult to preach it the father hard to testify what you are not we are the word of God we are supposed to speak what we are we love what we areed that's the best inheritance we can give our children I want to say this because God created us in his IM Fallen there is something in each one of us be to be a great man you're going to be a great somebody the best greatness you can have best greatness you can leave behind is the life of Jesus Christ all other things we have examples there are people who have been great scientists we read great things but let me tell you there is one person who came on this Earth we don't read of him as invading inventing an aned anything of science but he handled science his point of view of creation speak to the winds he could speak speak things and they changed the same power he gave it to Willi and could speak to [Music] a that's a situation should come in yes we have been hurt everyone who is here been hurt in one way or how can we be restored back how can it be possible that we can forget the past and start something [Music] fresh it is the presence of Jesus Christen Amen Let Us understand that the experiences we have gone through teaches us that there was something missing in us because God is love and let God back in our lives if he comes back in our lives we shall come back to each other someone are not going to bring Unity the experience of God is visitation is what is going to bring God works by pressure when pressure is [Music] coming there is a reason God wants to use that to learn God things are lessons and we should not leave them pass we should use them to learn praise the best thing God would give us is to make us own of land if he wanted would have given us to live eternally when even but the best he could do give eternal life he brought us back to himself at the time of being restored back to him who is the word if there is any testimony we can think about which has ever been special which has ever been unique which we read in the Bible or in the world it is a God made testimony there are no characters on Earth that have been compared the Bible characters and it's not mirac Miracle working it is living the life of Christ and the greatest enemy is ourselves not the person you are pointing the finger at is ourselves Jesus Christ Mighty conquer praise God brought on Earth that nobody ever lived a nature like the only nature which had power still has power to take us sinners we have seen we are defeated in many ways but God can bring us to himself like him and live like him praise God you can live for the children is a testimony they have given us amen it's no need the money what was in the family is true like theal son if you go very far away and God you will come back that's why the Bible say train your child way of God so that with time even if he's in a situation where he will come back amen so the prophet says if somebody says if a doctor says who your dad is gone there is no hope for your dad your dad is he said the best I can do for my children open my mouth and tell my children your dad is not dying your dad is resting that's the best thing you can know about it if Jesus never die if in the Bible told that he went to sleep that's why the scripture says they stoned him and then he went to sleep likewise our brother has gone to sleep going to rest in a better place we have not come here to cry we have come here to learn a lesson and God's lessons are Faith bring also do that I had an aunti she was dying I looked at her when she was dying I told myself I don't want to die then I saw my I read about bosor when dying and then he said I'm not dying this the best moment of my time best time I've ever been and then he started shaking people's hands praise God there was a sister when she was about to go she veryy very he says I've been seeing Angels here and we felling mother not them when felling I want to go like that oh I don't want to kick people I don't want to see Darkness I want to see the light and the same light we see when we are [Music] going the same light we saw when we are Jesus Christ there is no Memorial that we can ever think of than the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ he up he ConEd prise God to do that let's think on our ways amen amen think of a better thing Jesus Christ was so much in Harmon with the father until the father was in him whatever he spoke it created and Jesus Christ want such with us whatever we shall speak because it's us it will happen what is causing the problem thinking that the Bible says let's think one thing mind which was in Jesus Christ us let us understand every sister you think he's falling the thing is not going in the right yesterday we were buing a brother when you hear story about him in fact one of her daughters his daughters was saying is a very bad man that was before he was sick but I want to tell you Christ is this this this man this brother when she received this truth there is no truth like we have amen when heed the truth heed a went to where the wife was he had three wives the first wife wife he had tortured the first wife had gone to stay with the daughter but when he had that heed a vehicle went to and the daughter says I did not want to take the phone every time it was trouble so but God made away there was a young woman around took him straight there said I want to see your mom took him to his wife his he nailed down wife my wife I'm sorry terrible things to you please forgive me after that he turned to the daughter da says that time everything would remind him I I wasn't a Christian his life softened he got sick he got more and more soft oh praise God God knows how to handle his people put yourself in that I've always said you cannot compete with an God has a way of doing with he knows the THS to use he knows the rocks to use until this person comes that's God we serve go to testify to somebody to get sa I think we know what we mean want to say that this man Chang then how does he come later to become your enemy no we fall and Rise fight for a our blood will pain us come back to each other and my brother I'm sorry for what happened yes I was hurt yes you made a bad statement but I was also wrong why did I get annoyed like that Jesus told the devil the Jews has no in him even us cannot separate us not part of our virt we have something bettered is a shame for a man to KNE before a woman for a man to KN before a woman but the spirit of God lifted that man beyond let us watch out those Spirits we have come with lay them to thear until we are purified oh praise God can go forel to what's wrong with us why don't we go for the and we go for each we why it means we are still in those Cal we are noted God should help us tot I'm finishing Jesus Christ was so much in harmony with the father he didn't need toce himself what spoke vated him let's check what speak what we are handling what we are dealing with each other how weing each I believe we talking I'm talking toen let think about what we say how he handle the grace God has given God has given us is not a stepping stone for PP preaching things that have gone through has used us there is where he has used me there is where he has used you let's wake up let us know the voice of the devil the voice of Jesus Christ amen God is SE cannot perish it cannot the prophet says other could do this no nothing in Heavens El could do that but him for he was the beginning of that character the angel wasn't born as he was created a being worship God not our savior but in God was our savior because nature but it took God himself I hope you see it look that was expression to manifest such a character as that for others it was aign character let me say this there is nobody who has ever lived for God and fail to face fail to meet somewhere brother in theob family I mean a member in the family of the church somewhere when critize you something about but who are you born with evidence that we we were born with evidence that we are and we are sinners saved by by Grace walk as a sinner saved by grace that will make us walk Care Rep the of the Lord only one only one who never was like us and that's why we have the ability to speak about the impossible because they must happen don't doubt this the faith we have in what we are speaking is going to bring result if you don't wait until Rapture like our brother that is why he he created you we know very well some of us are not going to sleep some of us are not going to sleep we are waiting for a change and before the body is changed the character must change the attitude must change I don't care how emotional we are is what item are you in the what item are you before others I think that's very important what do people say I am Jesus asked what do people say I am he said then he said what did you say there he also wanted a testimony from brother we need a testimony if you don't need it I need it is something to shake me toize me something toep set me in line as I finish don't feel bad when they tell you what you are remember you lied to me I feel not like me don't be don't be let's not be cunning we are seeing this this attitude forgive me for that bad word you have perceived me me WR I am not I am I don't you Prophet tells us a human being is very intelligent and I believe is more intelligent it's not that he will judge the world it's not that later will Jud already has a spirit of disc you like him or not be frank and say brother you are right right pray for me sometimes I don't think well about be transparent [Music] before and let me tell you don't wait until you you are put in a casket like because during that time people fear to say bad things but if they tell me bad things now I think that that is good for me I should not take reason to fight back God bless you so much we know God loves us he has allowed this situation to express his love to us we have heard good things why can't we also say let me say this the brother got problems not not so much not not not that it was from people but I know some problems we get them because of the problems not created by people but sometimes lack of this you have a desire to you have a desire to help the church and you get you don't have the that also brings stress you cannot meet the condition of the age tell a lie you cannot write a letter because you're a Christian that becomes pressure your children need need things but you can't lie even get them you can't be you can't take bribes child you cannot go you cannot say let me go and beat this maybe C5 because of your integrity BR pressure to us and I've been very close to brother such a sincere person he can't lie can't run I should deal [Music] it brings pressure so we can look at maybe this happen maybe the other happen but I also know this a brother one time I had a problem and I believe he gave me all the money he had in he solved my problem and when you solve a problem like that the devil who was bothering this comes to disturb you what are you going to do now and then you go home you find a lot of problem but thanks be to God through it and
