It's not difficult at all. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, you just yield yourself just been continuous communion and you know all those things the Lord has promised they just come to be manifested in your life because it's a flowing stream. So you find this one has come out. This one has come out. The Lord shows you things which are going to be. The Lord reminds you You know, you start seeing yourself that you start having a burden to witness. You have a burden to pray for people.

Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Father, how we thank you for this afternoon. The grace that you've given unto us again that we can come into your presence. We pray may bless us again. Speak to our hearts, Father. May we have such communion, Lord. And then as we come into the Lord's supper, may also bless us. and through the way all the needs of your children in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there any song? &gt;&gt; Let us go to 1 Corinthians chapter 11. Chapter 11 and then from verse 20 to verse 26. So the Bible says, "When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. For in the eating everyone taketh before the other his own supper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken. What have you have you not houses to eat and drink in or despise ye the church of God and shame them that have not? What shall I say unto you? Shall I praise you in this? Shall I I shall I praise you not? For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sed saying, "This is the cup. This is the new testament in my blood. This do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as of as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord his death till he come. May God speak of his word. You may be seated. So we want to share on the Lord's supper. Praise the name of our Lord. Ideally these were meant to be all morning service. Then I was meant to pick something else for the afternoon service but we couldn't do that. I believe was the work of the Lord. That the morning we talk about the spiritual communion. Then in the evening we talk about the physical. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message communion of 1965, brother Brennham says you don't take the Lord's supper by a tradition. Like now we see the denominations. They do it as a tradition. There is a denomination whereby every time they have a service they have to do it even at the barrier they do it just a tradition. Now he says you take it because it is the love of God in your heart. Now see how it comes here. You do it because it is the love of God in your heart in keeping the commandments of God because you've heard that the Lord has told us to do it. And now when God presents an opportunity to us that we are going to observe the Lord's supper on this particular day. Praise the name of our Lord. You make sure that you are part of that service. And you see they were observing the Lord's supper in the first in the in the book of Acts. When we go to the book of Acts and then we read in chapter 2 and verse 42, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in the breaking of bread and in prayers. It was the commandment of the Lord. So now they said they contined steadfastly. And then now when you go go to verse 46, the Bible says, "And they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and in the breaking of bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of art. [Music] Now in Leviticus chapter 23, there are feast that the Lord told the children of Israel to observe. And now the first feast, praise the name of our Lord, was the feast of the Passover. because he told them this shall be the beginning of your days. You start from this day to count your years. You start from this day to count your calendar. I think let us pick up Exodus 12 before we go to that part. Praise the name of our Lord. Exodus 12 and then we we pick up from verse verse six. He says, &gt;&gt; "And you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month, and the whole assembly of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And then verse 97, and you shall take the blood and sprinkle it on the two side posts, on the upper door post of the houses where you shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh in the night roast with fire and and unleaven bread and with bitter hops they shall eat it. Now in verse 14 he says, "And this shall be unto you for a memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations. You shall keep it a feast by an orodiness forever. praise the name of our Lord. So it was the first feast and you know that it marks your beginning because they were leaving Egypt and then they were going into the land of promise. And you know that night an angel passed killing was born. But then on the doorpost where there was applied blood death was not in that house. Praise the name of our Lord. And then now the angel would pass over. And then he said this is the Lord's Passover. And then he said observe it in your generation. So they were doing it every year. They had a particular time that they would observe that. Praise the name of our Lord. And then they would have only unleavened bread. You know leaven stands for sin. But now this bread had no leaven in it. So they had to observe that. And so every when that day comes, they had they had to kill an animal for the Passover. And we know that the blood of the animal that's where the life is. But then for them they were eating the meat because they wouldn't take the blood of the animal. God told them they shall not eat the the blood of the animal. So now they were eating the meat, roasting it and then eating it. But the whole thing is an animal had given its life. Praise the name of Allah. Protect these people from death. And then we see that our Lord Jesus Christ comes and fulfills that as the Passover lamb. He's the one who took the death. He's the one who reconciled us back to God. So he comes as the Passover lamb in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and then verse 7. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Punch out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lamp as you are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us. So he said punch out the old leaven, take out your sinful life, sinful thoughts, sinful ways, punch them out. Now when you punch them out, then you are not having that leaven And that's the life that we should live in order to have communion with the Holy Spirit. And then he says, "Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with the old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Praise the name of our Lord. He said, "Don't have that leaven of malice, of wickedness, the things we're talking about in the morning which actually grieve the Holy Spirit and then they take you from the fellowship from the communion of the Holy Spirit. Now this means we shouldn't only be careful when we are coming to the Lord's supper but yet our daytoday living every day that we are alive we need to make sure we are right with God. Praise the name of the Lord. That should be our living that every day I'm walking clean. Every day I'm speaking right. Every day I'm thinking right. Every day I'm walking right. Not only when we are going to have the Lord supper. I spend the whole Friday praying and fasting. Lord make me worthy. Then I make sure that I don't pick any calls on Saturday in church. Now when I come on Sunday, I'm worthy. How about Monday? Praise the name of our Lord. How about Tuesday? So when you do like that, it's a tradition now. It's just a tradition. like the denominations they start on Ash Wednesday I think to fast and then you know I'm not going to eat meat maybe I don't know whether I can't afford it the whole month so he says I'm fasting meat I'm not going to drink I'm not going to go to the bar I'm fasting now the moment he finishes the fasting he has already saved money to drink a whole crate of beer That's not the way to do. But that's how they do tradition when they are coming to the church to them. That's now being humble. How about at home when you are shouting at your wife? Praise the name of the place. They told me that these brothers they are highly placed in the district. So when they come to on Monday in the offices putting on a tie suit nice shoes of the district service commission but when it comes to church sleepers and touched his shirt. Brother, we are meant to be humble. That's not true. That's not the humility. But you know, it's just some kind of tradition. When they define modest, they think you have to be sharp. No, you know there are those people with that kind of mindset, &gt;&gt; but that's not the thing. Praise the name of our Lord. So then you need to see that every day. you qualify to take the Lord's supper because that's how you keep the communion of the Holy Spirit because you need the spirit of God every day in your life. So you need to see that the stream is flowing. The Holy Spirit is communicating also communicating the whole day. Praise the name of our Lord. Those are the kind of lives we need to live. So they had it as a feast. Let us go back to Leviticus chapter 2. And they were observing this as their first feast. Praise the name of our Lord. He says in verse four, "These are the feasts of the Lord, even the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their seasons. in the 14th day of the first month at even that's evening is the Lord's Passover. So they were observing that every 14th of the first month. That was Passover. So they had to get an animal, sacrifice that animal and then roast the meat and eat it with actually unleavened bread observing the Lord's Passover. Praise the name of our Lord. They had to do it every year. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the book of Luke chapter 22 and then verse 9, it says, "Then came the day of the unleven bread when the Passover must be killed." So they were killing an animal every Passover. And then he sent Peter and John saying, "Go prepare us the Passover that we may eat." to praise the name of our Lord. He sent them now this day here made a change of things. Praise the name of our Lord. They were used to killing animals, roasting them for the Passover. But now this time, Christ tells them we only going to have unleaven bread and then the wine. And then he gives a definition what these symbols stand for. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in Matthew chapter 26 and then verse 26, he says, "And as they were eating, Jesus took the bread and blessed it and broke it and give it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat, this is my Now in the Old Testament there were families doing that but now here it is a fellowship a collection of believers and then the Bible said they were moving from house to house observing the Lord's supper and then Paul was telling them when you come to the supper don't come When you are hungry, oh they giving me small because you are hungry. You want to be satisfied. No, it's not coming to just be full. I say, oh, we have not been drinking wine. Now it's an opportunity. Give me the whole bottle. And then you become drunken. No, don't do that. Eat. When you come here, receive what is being given to you, praise the name over. Now, supposing we are too many and then they giving you something as small as a name. So, he says if you want to eat a lot, eat from there. Then when you come here, it's not coming to be full. It's not coming to be drunk, but it is coming to observe do in remembrance of the Lord till he come. Praise the name of our Lord. So now the Lord say this bread, praise the name of the Lord without leaven, he said it stands for my body. So he took it. He broke it. Why was he breaking it? Because the body was pierced through. Praise the name of our Lord. The body was smitten. the body, you know, was kind of, you know, like striped. &gt;&gt; So they were breaking it. So even now he's saying this, take it and break it. Praise the name of our Lord and then he gave thanks and then he gave to the disciple. He said take this is my body. So now the true meaning of this came out when Jesus gave the definition. So the unleavened bread stands for the body of Jesus. Praise the name of our lord. And also if we are filled with the holy spirit. We become part of the body of Jesus Christ. Because the bible says we are baptized into one body. 1 Corinthians 12:3 we are baptized into one body and the Holy Spirit. So now if you are really part of the body of Christ you would want to fulfill the commandment of the Lord and you are doing it out of love not a tradition and neither do we do it because we want to find out. who is not living right. No, &gt;&gt; we don't do roll calls. Why did you miss the other day, then again this day? There must be something wrong with you. We don't do that to do that. But we want to fulfill the commandment of the Lord. You do it out of love. You don't do it because you are compelled. No, if I don't know, they will think I'm not living out of love. Praise the name of God. So he says, "This is my body." And then he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it unto them, saying, "Drink ye all of it. Now they were not before drinking wine. They were not taking it but they were eating meat, roasted meat, but now they roasted meat because they no longer going to kill the animal. He says in the animal it was actually the the flesh which you were eating but the main thing in the animal is the blood because the life of the flesh is in the blood but you can't eat blood because that's the word of the lord the wine is now the representation of the blood is the representation of the life. And then he says now this wine is my blood. Praise the name of God. So there was a change and he said this is my blood in the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins. Now the blood of Jesus Christ is what brings the new testament. Now when they were making the old testament they used animal blood in Exodus chapter 24. Praise the name of the Lord. Exodus chapter 24 and then we read verse 8. And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people and saying, "Behold the blood of the covenant which is which the Lord has made with you concerning all these words. So the Old Testament is under the blood of animals. Praise the name of our Lord. They had to be eating meat every Passover. But we are in the New Testament which is the blood of Jesus Christ. There's no more animal sacrifice. Praise the name of God. But now we do eat in the memorial of the death of Jesus Christ that when he died, he shed blood for our sins. Praise the name of our Lord. But when he shed blood for our sins, the Holy Spirit comes back to the soul of the repentance. Praise the name of our Lord. So you see in the Old Testament, they only doing it once a year. In the New Testament, as often, praise the name of as often as you can. Praise the name of our Lord. You remember his death, burial and resurrection. Now the blood of the New Testament was under you know was animal blood and it brought the law. We are no longer bound by the blood of the new testament. But now we are under the blood of the new testament. which is the Lord Jesus Christ. The blood of the Old Testament was animal blood and it brought the Lord. But the blood of the New Testament has brought us grace. Praise the name of our Lord. It has brought us grace. He has brought us salvation. He has brought us healing. He has brought us deliverance. So everything you do by the blood of Jesus brings you victory. Praise the name of our Lord. It brings you deliverance. That's why in the name of the Lord, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Everything can be done. You can pray for anything in the name of the Lord Jesus. Praise the name of our Lord. So the wine stands for the blood of Jesus Christ. And he said this is the new testament. Praise the name of our Lord. So that Passover night. Christ fulfilled the killing of the animals and said I am now the Passover lamb. This is my blood. take it in remembrance of me. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in verse 9 of Mark chapter 26. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the Father's kingdom. It says at that time the Lord supper after the rapture says, "I'm going to take it." I know the Bible says that the last enemy shall be dead and the rapture means our bodies, our mortal bodies shall be fully redeemed. Right now, it's the soul that has been redeemed. But this body has not yet been redeemed. Praise the name of our Lord. This body can be attacked of anything. It's not the soul that has been redeemed. This body can be you know attacked by the devil any time. It can die can fall sick. But the redemption of this body is when this body the motor body shall put on imotear. When this mortal body can never die. When this mortal body can never grow old. When this mortal body can never become sick. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he say that's the time I'll drink with you in the kingdom. When the last enemy has been put down, the body of Jesus Christ has all been redeemed. Praise the name of our Lord. That's why as we live in this body, the Bible says, offer your body as a living sacrifice. [Music] Be careful where you go. Be careful the people you associate with. Be careful the things you watch. Be careful the things you hear because the devil uses all these avenues to come and attack you. and your testimony, your walk. And that's what the devil likes. You see that he puts you in regret. He makes you do something wrong. Then he comes on the side and starts laughing. Some people do also like that. &gt;&gt; But the devil has made you do those things. Those same friends you go with in this cohort. They just start shaming you. They just make you just become wasted. So you offer your body as a living sacrifice. You don't go in bad places. The Bible says abstain from appearance of all evil. So you avoid those places which are not right. Praise the name of our Lord. Your body is not yet redeemed. So watch it. Be careful. It has not yet been redeemed. The Bible says these are vile bodies. You know, anytime it can be put down, sickness can put it down. This man was look how he's falling down his bodies. Anything can happen now. Even if I cross the road, they will knock you. These bodies are not yet. I cannot be tempted. Even if I go to the bar, &gt;&gt; you're going in the wrong place because you're living in these bodies, &gt;&gt; they can be subject to anything evil. So you have to be careful. Praise the name of our Lord. Even when you have the baptism of the Holy David was anointed. a man after God his own heart. But when he saw a naked woman bathing, sin took over. So you have to be careful. What do you watch? What do you hear? Who do you associate with? That's why the morning service, where is your communion? Are you communing with people who are unbelievers? You can't have communion with the Holy Spirit. What are you communing with? Who are your friends? Where do you spend most of your time? Praise the name of our Lord. So right now, we thank God. We have the blood of Jesus Christ that washes us from all sin that washes us from all evil. So you should desire all the time to stay under that blood. Praise the name of our Lord. Just stay under the blood. Remain under the blood. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us quot that quote communion. It says of 1965 paragraph 41. &gt;&gt; So if you don't take it in sincerity, it's just a tradition. Well, our church observes communion every Sunday or every month or twice a year. And you go up and say, "Well, it's my time." And then take the communion. Why? It is a stink to God. It's just a tradition. Even like anything else. You've got to be sincere. God wants the depth of your heart. You remember the very God that brought here on earth. is the one you are serving. See, you are doing this because he said so because it is his order. Then we want to come up with the deepness of sincerity knowing that by God's grace that we have been saved and we love him and we filled his presence and we see change our lives. Our whole being is changed. We are different people. We don't live the way we used to. We don't think the way we used to. So what do you do? You do it in the depth of your heart. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us get back to 1 Corinthians chapter 11. Praise the name of our Lord. 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and then in verse 23, &gt;&gt; for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you, and this do in remembrance of me." After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sed saying, "This is the cup of the new testament in my blood. This do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord his death till he come. Praise the name of the Lord. Then he says, "Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. Now in the message communion said we want just holiness among us that no filthy communications be heard among us at all as we profess this great calling of God. We must walk worthy of this thing that God has brought us to and we are well down towards the end of the journey. Now we are now expecting the exceeding abundant above all that we could do or think. And remember, we want to constantly be in prayer. And above all things, watch your life. Is if your life don't t up with God's holiness. Then go back and start praying again. There is something wrong. See, we must live in that kind of a state. that the fruits of the spirit will make itself known through us. That's what we want to live. You know sometime we hear great preachers who can preach mighty but we would rather see a sermon lived than we would one preached. because that's the evidence that God is on the inside. It's the life that you live. So we need to walk worthy, not only on Sunday, not only maybe where people know you, but you know all the time, even where they don't know you. live like Joseph. He knew God was there. So he had the fear of God. I'm not going through this thing and sin before my God. Even YouTube should be the same thing. And that shows that you are in a continuous communion with the Holy Spirit. Even when nobody sees you, you want to be sincere. Praise the name of Lord. That's now walking worthy. But now if it is dodgy, you're not walking worthy. So you don't come to the table of the Lord because you are drinking of it or eating of it unworthily. But your work should be worthy. When I'm at my place of work, I seek to do what pleases the Lord. If I make a mistake, I run to the blood of Jesus Christ and then I say, "Lord, have mercy upon me." And then the Lord delivers me. Praise the name of our Lord. So then the Bible says in verse 27, okay, verse 28, "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eatth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself discerning the Lord's So now he says you have to walk worthily. But if you are not worthy then you are drinking damnation to yourself. So you should be that you are walking worthy every day. Praise the name of our Lord to be able to partake of the Lord's supper. And if and if you are part of the body of Christ, why don't you want the Holy Ghost to flow there? Commun communion, you know the spirit of God is leading you. The spirit of God is guiding you. Then verse 30, &gt;&gt; for this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord and that we should not be condemned with the world. Praise the name of the Lord. So he says some fall sick because they are not doing the right thing. Some become weak because they're not doing the right thing. Some die. So you shouldn't come when you're not worthy. Now none of us is worthy. Praise the name of none of us is worthy. But we only become worthy in the blood of Jesus. That's what makes us worthy. So now you call upon the name of the Lord. You confess to the Lord, Lord, this is where my faith is. Lord, this is where my weakness is. And then the blood of Jesus makes you worthy to partake of his body. That's what you should do. You wait on the Lord. Lord, have mercy upon him. Praise the name of our Lord. All your sin, all your trespasses, bring it under the blood. Praise the name of our Lord. Bring it under the blood. The blood shall never lose its power till the last elect is saved. Sin no more. Praise the name of our Lord. So you must be a personal. &gt;&gt; If you are going to take up the Lord's supper, you must have accepted the Lord Jesus as your person. You must have taken his name in water baptism and you must be walking worthy of the gospel that is preaching of the word of God. You are walking worthy. Whatever the Lord tells you to do, you are all the time. Lord, I'm doing. Lord, I'm going to do it. If I fail, Lord, have mercy upon me. Praise the name of our Lord. You bring your weakness under the blood of what makes you worthy. So when you come before him, you are washed. Praise the name of God. And then brother Brandham says that they walked for 40 years without anybody being weak because of the Passover. And now we have the Passover, our Lord Jesus Christ. Everything we have need of fulfilled it in his body. So even when we come to the Lord's supper, those who are sick can be healed. Praise the name of our Lord. Those who are bound, they can be delivered. Those who need the baptism of the Holy Spirit can be filled with the Holy Spirit. Anything can happen. What are you doing? You are in obedience to the word of God. Praise the name of And that's what you should always seek to do. Lord, I seek to be obedient to your word. You know, the Bible says, be willing and obedient. Lord, I'm here. I'm willing and I'm here. Praise the name of God. And that makes you worthy. Not in my own. But Lord, I'm looking at you. I'm looking at the perfect sacrifice like the other publican went the temple to pray and then there was a Pharisee there. The publican bow his head to the earth and he said Lord have mercy upon me. Then the the Pharisee oh Lord Hey, &gt;&gt; I'm not like the other public there. Now, instead of looking at your troubles, he's looking at the other one. I pray I fast two times a I fast two times a week. I pay my taxes. I do everything, not like the other one. And then the Lord said the Pharisee went home not justified. But the publican went home justified. Why? Have mercy upon me Lord. He looked at the sacrifice. Even now we are looking at the sacrifice. The sacrifice that has been made for us to make us worthy. Not ourselves to be worthy. only under the blood of Jesus. That's where we are made worthy. That's how you come under the lord. I'm depending upon your grace. I'm depending upon you. I see that I've searched my life and I put everything under your blood. Then you come. Praise the name of our Lord. Then in verse 33, wherefore my brethren, when you come together to eat, t one for another. one another. You are interceding for one another. Lord, I pray for my brother. Lord, I pray for my sister. Forgive him their trespasses. Deliver them from this kind of deliver from this kind of praying for one another. You are ting. Praise the name of our Lord. So that you know the Lord can have his grace upon us. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So we need to walk worthy of the gospel every day. Bring all our things under the blood. Let us live under the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let us bring our weaknesses under the blood. because he's the only one who praise the name of our Lord. Now that same night after the Lord's supper, he did the foot washing. Praise the name of our Lord in the book of John, chapter 13 and then verse five. The scripture says &gt;&gt; after that he pou water into basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was guarded. Then cometh it to Simon Peter and says unto him, Lord, thou wash my feet? &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do, th knowest not now, but th shall know here after. Peter saith unto him, "Thou shalt not wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me." If now Christ would tell Peter that about foot washing How about us now? So we need to be obedient to the word of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. Foot washing. See that you participate in what the Lord has told us to do. And you know like in the in the Middle East, you know, because when Jesus was talking to Peter here, Let us continue in the scriptures. In the scriptures here, let us go to verse verse 10. Jesus said unto him, he that is washed needeth not to wash his feet, but is clean every week, and you are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore he said you are not all clean. Now he said you're not all clean. Meaning Judah escarot You're not clean. &gt;&gt; What was Judas Scariot doing? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us go to Mark rather let us go to Luke chapter 22. Luke chapter 22 and then we read verse three. The Bible says &gt;&gt; then entered Satan into Judah's Escariot being the number of the 12. And he went his way and communed with the chief priests and the captains how he might betro him unto them. And they were glad and confidented to give him money. Now he went and covenanted. He went and communed. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of us. And we're talking about communion. What do you commune with? See Judah escarot here. Communing. Satan entered him. Then he commune with people who are demon possessed. And then he comes the lord. Now in verse 19 okay let us start from verse 21 but behold the hand of him that betroth me is with me on the table is communing here with the devil and those who are going to kill and then he's coming to commune with the Lord of unworthy. We shouldn't do like that. I spent the weekend in the nightclub and I've not repented about it. Nobody knows my secret life. I spent weekend doing something &gt;&gt; like now those of Elvis Priestley &gt;&gt; Elvis Priley &gt;&gt; spend night on nightclubs clubs those shows you know on on those live life live bands Then on Sunday they in the choir singing Jesus loves me &gt;&gt; in the night worshippping devils on Sunday worshiping God communion communing with devils and you are communing here with God. You are serving the table of devils. Now you're coming. The Lord is stable. You shouldn't walk like that. That's unworthy. This was he had finished communing with the Pharisees. I know him and I will give him this time. You will do it. He also comes our light. So then the Lord Jesus says, "You are all clean." What made them clean? The word which he spoke made them clean. Praise the name of our Lord. Because the Bible says we are clean by the word of God. Now in John 17:1 17, he says, "Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth." So when you hear the word of God and obey the word of God, it makes you clean. It makes you worthy. But now when you don't obey the word of God, you are not worthy. You are not clean. because you you refuse to wash the water is here but when you go to wash like I'm told in some of the boarding schools they use perfumes can take a month without bathing disguising the other false smell Now we need to bathe by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. But Judas scariot for him he was refusing to bathe. So he was not clean. So Jesus was telling them you are all clean but one Jud scared he's communing with devils is not part of me but it's part of the other people. So he was not worthy but we need to be worthy. Praise the name of our lord. So now foot washing they were washing from outside a bathroom outside like in most of our villages. So after bathing you walk to the house but when you reach at the doorstep your feet have gathered some dirt. So you have to get water and clean that. So when we come for foot washing we don't come with brushes scrubbing brush. We don't do that. Praise the name of So you come to observe. And the significance of it is to turn for one another. You humble yourself. I will keep you in my prayers. I will keep you in my prayers. when I see you doing wrong, I'll come and tell you my brother. But some other people don't want to admit when they being told they're wrong. But that's the whole thing. Be your brother's keeper. That's the significance. Pray for me. Pray for me. Encourage me. I'll encourage me. Correct me here. I'll also correct you here. And we move as the body of Jesus. Praise the name of our Lord. We wash each other's feet. Praise the name of our Lord. And so Peter told the Lord, you are not going to wash my feet. Jesus told them, if I don't wash your feet, then you are not part of me. So we need to be part of these things. Praise the name of our Lord. Now back to John chapter 13. And then verse 14, &gt;&gt; if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet, you ought also to wash one another's feet. you an example that you should do as I have done to you. Very I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are you if you do them. Praise the name of our Lord. So we desire to do what the Lord wants us to do. As often as you would do it. Now in 1 Timothy chapter 5 and then verse 9, the Bible says, "Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man. well reported all for good works. If she have been brought up children, and if she have loded strangers, if she have watched the saints feet, if she have tra relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work, Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Now you see that foot washing was one of the qualifications to show that this person is walking right if she has washed the saint's feet. that done during the Lord's supper. So we need to be observing it. Now in the message questions and answers, he says over in second Timothy, Paul said, writing to the church, don't let a widow be brought into the church until she has washed the saint's feet. That is right. Feet washing was observed all through the Bible days and go by God's help. If I keep my right mind and God helps me, I will observe it till I die. That is right. It is exactly a commission of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. So we should always desire, Lord, let me do what you've told me. Let me do your will. I want to do your will, Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. And we participate in the Lord's supper. You participate in the foot washing. Praise the name of our Lord. And here God has given us a privilege that we have the facilities to use. Praise the name of our Lord. We have the facilities to use. They are enough. So you really can't have any reason. But then there are places you go to. You have only one person. So all others have to wait and then you there's a place we did it I think up to one. You have to wait for that one person. One thing yet Sunday you have to come back for you know different things but here God has given us bread we have our running water there so you're not going go to the well and when we have our water here why do you want to use one liter praise the name of our lord So we need to see that we participate in it as the Lord has given us the ability. Praise the name of our may God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us sing this song. When we all get to heaven as the song leader comes. When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be when we see Jesus [Music] and shout the victory. I heard bright and blessing. You prepare for us up when we all when we all get to. What a day of rejoicing that will be. Oh, when we all see Jesus, he'll sing and shout of victory. Oh, there is a river of life flowing out of me. makes the lame to go and the blind to see.
