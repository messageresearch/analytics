to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I want to say that it's a wonderful time for me again to be here and to to be able to talk to the married people my history is always an open book amen and I'm glad that I'm now speaking to the married because I started here by speaking to the Sunday school so I told Sunday school for some time when those were in Sunday school were promoted to become youth I started again now speaking to the youth and I've been speaking to the youth me almost all the youth that in Sunday school so I follow them now when they have escaped the youth married now God has again given them amen and not only that when they become old we shall again with the old people so you all welcome in the amen I'm so grateful and happy to be together yeah the Lord knows how to deal with us and he speaks the you know there's a message Prophet says season in due time yes so every season has got it own foot and there are things that we really need at a certain time so I trust God will bless us and help us so thanks dear brother [Music] jamesa standing and ping and doing all that at home I was telling the I the people in Cala I've learned to accept that I'm a pastor after some time when I I refused I refused I refused then I had to accept that I'm now a pastor but while I'm here I'm a brother amen I'm there I'm a pastor but it takes a time for you to accept what you are and as you struggle with that you go through many challenges so I want to invite you to the Book of Ruth [Music] Ruth 1 verse 1 to 5 Luc so the Bible says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went so J in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons the name of the man was elik and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Mahon and chilion ephus of Bethlehem Judah and they came into the country of Moab and continued there andik Naomi's husband died and she was left and had two sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one opah and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years and Mahon and Chon died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband for may God had bless in the reading of his word we may get seated amen so we thank God for his meres I want to say that in the message of the hour our training is always in the in the church and has been Always by the Bible and the message we have not known so much of scientific theories and whatever even when it come to meetings like this uh please just uh bear with us we shall be still in the message of the hour we just pi and bring a context that will be able to help us in a situation I remember I think it was Paul it was Paul was writing said to the younger people the old people to the Aged and every type of category there's a way the Lord speaks to every category amen so when we come to the married I believe that God speaks to the married people still in a very very special way because they are the type of him and the church amen so there is no way you see everything that we have on the earth must be speaking of God when you are young you are in the age of the youth and whatever the Lord says you are you are a bride the bride is in that age but when you marry then you reflection of Christ and his church amen amen so this evening I'll just share something on the family of pleas toship amen taking Ruth and and her family which was you know from the family of el amen I always do a lot of writing but I don't have ating when I used to Sunday school here people used to say he's a teacher I draw CHS and bring them up but it's just the the way the Lord shaped me so when we talk about a family of pleasant worship we just want to look at the of amen as a believing family that started on very well that was ordained of God and when you look at their startup it's entirely the family that reflects God Amen because as we started through the prophet we know that it means a worship amen and when you go to the study in the Bible they say my God is king So the real man a Believer he must be able to be a real believer and a worshiper of God Tye the husbands amen every true man a real Christian must have God as his King and he must be a worshiper of God Amen and then when he got married he got married toii which means my delight which means Pleasant amen so when man who is worshiping God marries a woman he marries something which is Pleasant something which is a delight something which puts his heart on fire amen so the man worshiping God marries a woman called delight and then they become a pleasant worshiper amen and a family of Believers always starts with that as the formul pleasant worship should a man Mar a woman who he doesn't Delight in it will be a problem or should a woman Mar a man who doesn't worship God it will be always a problem is that amen the woman must bring PR into the home and the man must bring Worship in the home amen true worship is always Guided by a man amen and all the joy that comes in a home is always moded by the woman so when people get married always Pleasant worship amen before during it should be always Pleasant worship amen so a home begins with worship and pleasant amen when the two are united together then that house that house it will be House of God because the Bible tells us come together and they agree upon anything I will be in their mid and God God himself cannot be God without people woring him amen he was Elohim El but the prophet tells us because he desired a family then it made him Jehovah which is God and God is an image of worship so if a man is a worshiper then he must be worshiping God and whever God is worshiping that's where he will come so a man must be able to bring God by his life into the family it's our responsibility as men amen and as the man brings worship which is God now in the ministry then the woman must be able to do Pleasant if you remember when God visited Abraham did he to it was Abraham amen the Angels first met Abraham Abraham worshiped Abraham know praised God Abraham started having fellowship with God as long as Abraham was having fellowship with God was happening to Sarah God underscore because sah was laughing when she would drop what was happening it wasn't realistic is that amen and God was looking but had he visited it was Abraham and Abraham now begin to say sah prepare something sah do this sah let us make our visors amen but who is the head of that is the man when a man goship go that amen and it's very important women areed in a way of they dress pleasantly they talk pleasantly they walk pleasantly the way they arrange the house is to pleas the way they dress the children is to pleas everything is pleasing and she must be pleasing is that she must please the husband amen and the husband must stay in position a worshiper a servant of God when God went to is the house of lot he never went to the wife where did he go to lot when Adam and Eve sinned went to Eve where did he go to Adam where are you why he the head he must be able to be the lead if you watch it very carefully from a few houses where people are blessed women will always Drug In Worship yeah will always Drug In Worship Is that amen the man is always the driver I always tell people that in the morning if were to check what has happened in people's homes the church is the only assembling place but before they leave homes areay there must be some to drive is that amen and as they drive you know that's how worship begins and will be happy with that God will not punish them for doing that amen because for the sisters are uning working on the foring on the ears working on the dress everything should be pleasing is that amen but husband we must go we must go Brothers keep it up if you are doing if you are not doing it pick it up is that amen and sisters God has made you you have a of making things Pleasant is that amen home where there is no woman you realize the way things are of a woman it makes things different is that amen the sockes have got to be ordered where they supposed to be so stocks yeah the stockings of a man know sometime men just throw their stocks they throw the tie there they throw the cour there somebody want thing to be done pleasantly amen be saying No this is supposed to be here this is supposed to be here and the brothers don't like that sometime the toothbrush is thrown that way the brush is thrown the another way and they want it to be they want to use it the following when they are told please this should be done like this too much but she want things to be pleas is that amen see at home just to give a little example we have I've got my daughter patience she's very orderly patience patience is very order and Joseph is a Freel amen so sometimes when she's moing Joseph is not very careful so what she no entering this house until I have finished this we must put things this way we must put things this so he has got to obey then afterward sometimes he would say I have fought a good fight I finished the rest now the rest of the people can enter Because she want things to be pleasant in a woman friends sister if that is not in you you'll find things a bit hard put things in a pleasant way is that amen so here is a story that we are following because the Bible says it says behold in Psalms 133 behold how good and pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in amen when home is together when a home is United how good and pleasant it is for our home it's like a precious ointment upon the head that R down upon the Beard's beard went down to the SCS of his G so when people dwell together it's Pleasant and God will always come down is that amen if you give real worship B says God will be amen when a rightship God was pleased amen and when he was pleased then the pillow of fire came it's pleasing when you do the right thing it's pleasing when the home is together when the man is taking his position and the woman is taking her it says as it's like the ointment which was flowing down it makes the it Mak things easy oil soften things amen it breaks down all the things so as long as as long as was which me worship he was in of worship things were moving and as long asii when they in the right place and what was the right place the house of God is bread amen amen as long as you are in that house where you can eat the word of God where both of you can dwell there and eat the word you will have pleasant worship amen what brings problems is when one lets go I'm going to talk about two things and when the prophet was preaching the message choosing of a bride he emphasized two things he says must be born again he must be born again then two says character is that amen two things he never preached discipline he preached character I hope yeah that's right I think there is a wide difference between discipline and character when you are choosing you choose character according to God you don't choose discipline is that amen so we are going so the character must be one that fear has God somebody who is given unto God that is somebody whom you can correct somebody you can M somebody who can be Chang he must first of all be having the fear of God is that amen the moment one of us loses the hold of God then discipline will become a key judgment will become the key for judgment you holding to God each of you will judge one another by character and character is not a gift character is a victory the things that you go through and they later on produce Christ in your life discipline is trained is that amen so when people get lose about God they begin to judge one another by [Music] discipline she doesn't KNE down she doesn't greet me that's discipline and that one is trained from home is that amen and that one even in a home you'll find people having different disin is that amen same father mother but their discipline is different actually they can even tell you that boy or that girl is not disciplin but he at home now when they are giving you they don't give you somebody who is not disciplined they give you a character which means it can be worked upon and to certain level is that so herei was sa as long as he can eat the word can also eat the but the moment Tres begin to come because first year second year maybe you can bear with one another maybe first month second month you can bear with one another why it's only two people it is is it is worship and pleasantness let's and pray let us go let's go out out that's all that works in the first few few times a few days few months come I you like the way we do when they wedding open your mouth it is Pleasant n thank God [Music] pleas then afterwards a child is born and the child who is born is called is that amen the first and the prophet tells us what is that sickness the name means sickness out of your union you are surprised sickness is coming up out of your pleasantness and joy and sickness comes up she's weak every morning she doesn't wake up like the way she used to wake up she's vomiting every hosp what is it out of the relationship a child is coming but it begins with sickness and that begins another approach of things amen then if if you didn't choose character begin to see the discipline coming because there are sometimes some of them become so irritated amen everything is irritating some of them can begin quarreling a little thing they are sh and you said they used to tell me they used to tell you see Pastor used to warn us we should choose character but I think I didn't hear that is discipline that is not character is that amen it's discipline but it's coming out of circumstance is born sickness is born before they knew that the second one was worse than the first one it was Meo amen and before they knew that fell in the land that's external forces she's having two children she can't work she's there all the time in hospital bills are accumulating and what is happening instead of pleasant she's no longer Pleasant things are changing so what happen is they leave the house of Fellowship because of internal and external pressures they decided to go somewhere out and where did they go something a little bit like a Christian or not Christian you know we are we are still in church but these days we are too busy s in church now let me tell you that's where danger begins to sleep in amen dies the moment troubles push them out of the real worship out of the place of worship God has got a chosen place where he wants to be worshiped the TR pushed them out of that if Satan can get you on the ground where you don't have protection he will with you he will with you so they went to Moab the first thing which died was the bread winner the bre winner died and the children were left just in the hands of pleasant and without a real guidance of worship if a man is not in his position and worship has died the children will marry anything they find is that amen you have moved a long way you have born sicknesses born Bloom you born stubbornness but never get out of Bethlehem never get out of the true place of worship when you get out of there into something which looks like a real Christian but not a Christian worship will die you will be the same person but they will tell to you like the way they ask those people can you sing for us the the songs of Zion and then you will say how can we sing the Lord songs when we in a Strange Land you are supposed to be simple principles let me say this that every time you get married the V is you know you will be able B to stay together in in riches and in poverty uh in sickness and in health those are two major things if you are able to stay together when sickness has come you are getting somewhere because it will come is that amen if you a to stay together when poverty has come you're getting somewhere because will every house will be tested by that there will be a sometime there will be a lck sometime but the L should never drive you from the original place where you have defense I've always given this example I don't know how true and deep it is but it is this way dogs die more on the road at home why when dog goes [Music] out it doesn't fear but when it goes out it loses Direction it loses control so it's just going like when it sees the vehicle it's standing there it's guarding where it's not supposed to guard and dogs die very much they are very tough and they don't you don't threaten them they car nature but in a Strange Land you will not survive is that amen you have CED a part of your Christian values long as you are out of Bethlehem you in Moab it will be problems the prophet says he asked a young man young man asked me the other day you think I could ow to get married such and such a girl I said how much do you think of her said oh my I just love her I said well if you are not going to live without her you better marry her then but if you can live without her you better not so but if it is going to kill you you better go ahead and get married and so what was I trying to get to him this that if you love her so much right in now before you are married everything is just fine and D worship pleasant but after you get married then the TOs and the trials of Life come in that's when you have got to be so in love that you understand one another when you are disappointed in her she is disappointed in you you still understand one another is that amen because you are going to disappoint one another as long as you are staying together you have those differences you are two families you have lived with your family for 20 years has lived with his family for 20 years now you are bringing all those complications in those after you have gotten married you need to have loved her otherwi there are things you will see say I wish I didn't see I wish I saw it before it's good you didn't see it because you need to be worked up your patience needs to be worked your gentl needs to be worked your character needs to grow because character grows sometimes we say that man has character what are you talking about character is a victory he must be able to overcome certain things then you can attach a character upon that person you only talking about discipline which was a training at home which you can bring very good values you were trained with at home and to another one they are vies to another person they are vies VI yeah it's not a virtue it's a vice it's not it's not a good character to them it's nothing really no sense is that amen because homes train their children they are girls oh you know you must greet must PL you must do whatever now you go and you hand such a person into the of another one the others that is useless where he grew up do that so for you when you are doing it just looking at to them that is not a value at all say what do you want me to do he says but for you is dir you are not [Music] styish your values are somebody's you are trying to stay in the kitchen for sisters they always watching TV and they're working on their hair and they getting the good perfume but for you not asking for even a perfume are we together you know we were in a certain family and you know the landl was brought up in a very very wonderful way hard worker and everything always you know putting everything in order working so the boys who were around they made a comment you know the husband went for another woman and they were saying you know this one the husband could not put up with her got somebody you know who is at least stylish this whatever you the world Jud so that can bring a conflict why are people fighting in a matter of values that are different bring on table we must bring the real character of Jesus Christ the love of God let your husband never leaveth never help him you will lose him is that amen you may be having poverty because as long as children have increased is that amen but stay where the drops of meres are bright when you are disappointed in her it says and she's disappointed in you you still understand one that's the way it is with Christ see we have got to be so in love with him when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit so I don't know in this family whether it was who was pressing so much other people always they go outside other people always they do this but for you are here and now the family is going to kill us and now we have our two children and now so what happens Journey up toab and when they reached Moab they were like a dog has been in an enclosure now it is outside what happens the light knocked it's concentration he died after that the children married outside of the church that's another danger is that amen worship the children once they don't have a guidance to them it was very easy they married moabites and happen they also died Pleasant worship with sickness M with Gloom and sadness the moment worship [Music] left these two took a hold of the situation they took a hold of the situation it was now sickness and Gloom and then death what happen the name changed no more worship the home has changed are we together the next thing that has come Pleasant no longer there it became what does mean bitterness sadness what are we talking about stay where theop ofes are bright amen the only thing that always brings chaos in a home unbearable chaos is when people worship dies because of living fellow is that amen now in the interest of time I just now be speaking the prophet gives us a story about lot lot and his wife it says lot left Abraham and went with his family just exctly like the way left Beth and went with his family but now l l failed to see because he was the leader he didn't see ahead that where he's going there's no where he going it is commotion he didn't know but he would not come back with his wife not only his wife didn't know that he would not come back with his children Lord did not also know that he would end up sleeping with his own children but if you follow the story he says when a Christian regardless of what happens when he leaves the God given position where he is fed if is strong will be powerless why he from theion so Church a blessing for God for us to have children it's a blessing for us to get married it's pleasing to God pleas what do you do whatever they are going to be these two types of forces I'm going to talk about one sometimes it is lack and sometimes it is Pless sometimes people are pushed and they suffer in the home because of Plenty that's why David said God don't give me much don't give me riches because I will eat and forget about but again don't give me poverty because I will steal and I shame your name the two extremes always keep the houses out of sometimes people are so humble as the prophet says the message influen sometime they are so good he says maybe they have nothing but as they continue in the presence of God then God blesses them the moment they are blessed the blessings push them out of Fellowship and we have seen people who are very obedient as long as they are poor but let them get something they are not ruled it's like a children obedi when they don't have a diploma when they don't have a degree let them get a degree and then then the parents are nothing let your blessings never push you away from the S of blessings but let your blessings dra you much closer the source of blessings never disconnect yourself regardless of what God does if your wife is becoming stubborn if your husband is becoming stubborn don't you ever push yourself or push him out of the presence of God Church you are better off with the man who listens to the word and the woman who listens to the word the man who doesn't who doesn't but sometimes bless push us the inability to contain a little blessing the prophet says maybe you used to have a bicycle blesses you with a car and from there you move to a better neighborhood and you get a better class of people and before you knew you are in a better Association you begin to associate with drunken you begin to do things that you never used to do when you do that you will blame your family because it will begin to disintegrate whatever happens keep your touch with the Lord let it never get lose amen let me just look at something here I'm saying that insufficiency can also be another problem because when things are very bad you know a very poor man is very hard to laugh it can either way it's not easy to love a poor man together because poverty is a real the I want tell you if there is no character that's where no disciplines will come out poverty goes along with a lot of sickness it brings bitterness I mean when you are poor sometimes it brings a lot of complications I want to use the real word complic okay poverty brings amen you begin to measure salt you begin to me to measure food this I [Music] yester it's already over it's poverty [Music] poor men are very complicated people when a man is poor the woman must be real patient if the woman is working and she delays to come back that's when you see the poor man it's because I don't have a job that's why you are coming back I had a job don't respect me any small thing respect because I'm poor poverty can even kill your home when you are because it makes you very delicate a poor man is very and in that delicacy sometime they become we so God help the husbands have money that amen you see even transport transport here we can walk here we for you always want but you try to normalize things because of poverty i' people who count even the pieces of meat so the sister will be you know it's not really that's not character that's now discipline [Music] he begins to pick out the discipline of his home for us by the way at home be now when supplies go down people begin to devise either defensive or attacking or protective measures but I want to tell you Christians if you want to prosper stay in the presence of God whatever little that God is blessing you with as a family thank God give your be in the presence of God thank God give your ti in the presence of God it's unlimited what God will do for you stay humble there are people when they are blessed they become arogant when arance comes arant before God just remember your family is going it's not even your your fellowship is with God will begin to say but your family is going and when your family goes sometime the amendment is very hard because God can save them God can save you but you will never have pleasant you may never have the original worship again she lost her husband lost her children God restored her but never gave her the pleasant instead of was Ruth gained is that amen lot lot when he left the real presence of God the family I'm talking about a family family that used to worship God the Bible tells us when they got money they became a problem for Abraham for them it was money they were Rich we can now manage our Affairs used to Ru us he used to control us and the moment they got off from the original princi slowly they know the B says the of Sodom of lot but it never Vex the wife Soul neither did itex the children is that amen because he's the head of the worship but he cannot be powerful when he's inom and so he remained suffering alone the little strength he got from Abraham not stand the strength and when the children went the Bible says talks about these two women Sarah sah and Mrs L the Bible says remember wife then it says also about sah as sah as sah obeyed her husband calling him Lord so should you the daughters of Sarah obey your husbands that's the compliment about sah is the compliment about about Mrs L remember L's wife what do you remember about L's wife when she left the prophet tells us she was she was now among all the women she was the leader of the women's clubs she was so popular having been with Abraham having been with Abraham been brought up well when she went there she was on top of the situation they respected her she was the head of the mother's Union she was the head of every society and she got a lot of riches such that when the Angels Came and they were saying this city is going to be destroyed the heart of M lot already gotten into the world world could not get out of her the second thing is that a mother will always remain a mother are we together so when the message came saying you tell your inlaws also to come out the Bible says when Lord told them those who married his daughters it was like a tail they just laugh at him so what happens their daughters with their son inw they never came in like it was the time of Noah for this ones they remain outside there now Mrs L she was being she was now being oppressed her riches were out her children were out her grand daughters were out Grand Sons were out then the man is saying let us go and the angels are saying let us so they get L she's moving but heres are behind her grand daughter is behind her daughters are behind and as a mother her heart was behind so she started to cry before you know had the fire burning had fire burning what was it it was her grandchildren it was her daughters it was her son were bur she turn a little bit and she became a of remember L's wife where did they begin they started when they got riches the workers started you know commanding them the workers started to command them you can't stay here this is man does this this man does but you have been with this man all you have been with this church all along and you know the ground and when they got that they moved but L the all that he went with he didn't come back with something he remain lot and produced Moab even when even when went to Moab it wasn't good it was death even when isra was moving and met Moab it was wasn't anything was always TR what do you produce at the end as a family we must produce ISAC as a family we must produce we must produce we must produce the tries but what did produce they were together but he went away the Church of the Living God we should have the pleasant worship always together how do you do that keep your position in the word keep your stand in the presence of God and I want to say TR will come Temptations will come but never lose your ground when when you go to politics for look of money when you go to when you go to Pleasures because of money for money you lose your children for you you may remain actually but in most cases they come back alone in most cases the parents come back alone I went full I've come back with and the name changes the prod son he went he went out son when he came back he said I'm not worth to be called but a servant families is a blessing when God gives us the opportunity to live together God will give you people to live within this world I just want to say that the world is very very amen it's very hard and if God gives you somebody to live with bear with one another is that amen I said this as I grow that every time you grow you learn to appreciate your your mate much more than is that amen when you are young you can play around with somebody for me for me for me I to [Laughter] you when you grow you realize you never helped actually God gave you a gift to help you in your helpl is that amen you learn to become brothers and sisters and more closer one another brother or a sister my sisters don't know me the way my wife knows me neither do her sisters or her brothers know her the more I know her she's a sister more than a sister my wife is a sister but more than sister her brother more than brother when God gives you some to live with treasure them don't say for me I can live without you your name is going to change from pleas you say he has died with his worship that's all no but he has left you you are going to change the name your name will change treasure one another one another is that amen you think like this person is a bit complicated what I've been saying pray for the character is that amen if is complicated sometime it's a character it's a nature sometime they upbringing amen for want to get her pure and pure but all him pure and pure it cannot be overnight he has been trained like that for 20 years you have stayed with this person for one year and you say cannot cannot change sometimes just what you want her to become which is not even standard sometimes what you are talking about is not a standard do you love the Lord unity and fellowship brings down God in our home and all the people that I have seen that have moved together and they are united even when they make a mistake God will save them I look at Abraham I know they made a mistake leaving the Homeland Abraham made a mistake and is lying about his wife she's my sister but one thing was Abraham and Sarah they were together is that amen so in their mistakes God forgave them even when she lied together here this friends no one of you doesn't make a mistake the prophet tells us sah and when God asked her s why did you laugh she said I never laugh are together and the prophet says if it wasn't for Abraham was supposed to die so I think afterwards Abraham went back but you youa problems even when God is there are we together you see you see lying over your father ly your it should get out of you after they move they going to because of food because of TR when they ask you what is your relation tell them you are my sister they might me because of you sahah you Rel with

for you lying think God wouldn't have you see that lying of your father change each of you will be at a certain time when you are playing the right one time you realize you are the cause of trouble God would have struck and now the wife was going to be taken you can't even protect also what God has given you bear with one another family stay in worship when Blue Man sadness comes them all

good fight together we have gone through thick and thin but we have come at the end and the prophet says on the resurrection morning those two are together amen let's fight together Let's Stay Together Lear to play learn to play Simple because Abraham the Bible tells us when they were when I think was it Isaac it was Isaac amen when he had also taken on the lives of his father and he had
