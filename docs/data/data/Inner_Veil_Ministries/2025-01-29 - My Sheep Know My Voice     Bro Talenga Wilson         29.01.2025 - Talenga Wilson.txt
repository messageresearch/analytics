inv me to speak to you amen do you love him amen so let's get on our feet and get our Bibles and open the Book of John chapter 10 we shall read verse 11 up to around verse 24 amen and the Bible says I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd gives his life for the ship amen and it says but he that is UN haing and not the shepherd who own the Sheep are not sees the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and flee and the Wolf catches them and Scatter the Sheep theing flee because he is not he is UNH Haring and care not for the Sheep I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep andn and as the father knoweth knoweth me even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the Sheep and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one she Shepherd therefore do my father love me because I lay down my life that I may take it again no man Tes takes it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this commandment have I received of of my father amen may the Lord bless his word we may get seated amen amen so I want to speak on my sheep know my voice my sheep know my voice and when I speak they hear and they recognize that this is the voice of the shepherd praise the Lord and Jesus himself said I am the Good Shepherd praise the Lord I know my sheep and they are known of me praise the Lord and now as he was speaking this verse 19 says there was a division therefore among again among the Jews for these says and of them said he has a devil and is mad why he others said this are not the words of him that has a devil can a devil Open the Eyes of the blind was a division amongest them the was that he spoke to them when he was teaching them praise the Lord he says I am the shepherd and then he led his to the sheep and says they are sheep and because they are sheep they are known of me and I know them praise the Lord and says I keep the flock all of them in my FL and then it says in verse 22 and it was at Jerusalem the Feast of the dedication and it was Winter and Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's por then came the Jews around about him and said unto him how long do thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly Jesus answered them I told you and you believed not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of but you believe not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you and then he says my sheep hear my voice those that were his when he spoke they were able to know that he is the Shepherd that he is the Christ and they had no doubt in their heart the Lord that's why when there was a cont some of them called him a devil there were certain of those that rose up and said for sure he cannot be a devil because the devil cannot open eyes of the blind man they recognize their Shepherd and Jesus comes down in 27 and says my sheep know my hear my voice and I know them because when I speak they follow me praise the Lord when I speak they hear the voice and they are able to know that that is the master then they come and follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man PL them out of my hand praise the Lord my sheep know my voice I know them and they know me that's what he said says when I call them they hear and they don't hear and remain there when they hear the voice they come towards the shepherd praise the Lord they come towards me praise the Lord I am the good shepher praise the Lord now A Good Shepherd takes care of his flock he does not allow strangers in neither does he let wild animals come in but a good shepherd he's the one that keeps his flock and therefore he can lay his life for the flock and that's what Jesus said he says I a good shepherd because I can lay my life for the sh I can lay my life for them praise the Lord for their sake I have the power to take it back again praise the Lord says I am a good shepherd Jesus Is a Good Shepherd praise the Lord because he said he can lay his life indeed because he's a good shepher he laid his life for us the Sheep praise the Lord he laid his life for us to be safe he laid his life for our Salvation praise the Lord he laid his life so we could be reconciled back to him praise the Lord and so he says now when I speak out my sheep because they are a sheep they have the nature of a sheep they are obedient praise the Lord because they know I am the shepherd when I speak they hear praise the Lord and when I call they come and they follow me my sheep know my voice praise the Lord he says I can lay my life for them and then I can pick it again praise the Lord so now God thinking about us how Satan will divert us from the original plan of God he laid his life for us that we may be called back to his flock praise the Lord because you believe that you were a part of him you were a part of his flock praise the Lord And now when Satan came heed us from the original plan of God and when we we got born to the world we got lost praise the Lord and forgot all that we wear and forgot all that we were we forgot who we were but now when Jesus comes praise the Lord he lays down his life he lays down his life for us as a sacrifice praise the Lord such that we can be reconciled back to God and get back to the flock praise the Lord so now because he said I can lay down my life for this that makes him the sacrifice for his flock so he became a sacrifice our FL and he is still the sacrifice for his flock so he does not allow any strangers in he does not allow any wild beast to come in he is very protective of his flock praise the Lord but then when he speaks this flock every sheep in the flock must be able to recognize the voice of the shepherd praise the Lord and when they recognize the voice of the shepherd you must move right to the shepherd praise the Lord because if you don't move towards the voice you shall not be safe why he says certain of them are not in The Fault praise the Lord but he said but when I call them they shall hear the voice then they shall come in and then it shall be onefold praise the Lord so when you hear the voice of God you don't remain there but you have to move towards the voice because that's where there is security praise the Lord my sheep know my voice so we can only be safe when we are in the flock because there is a sacrifice at the door the shepher himself laying down there for our protection praise the Lord so we are only safe when we are in the flock of the she praise the Lord and nothing can harm us praise the Lord nothing can harm us as the sacrifice lays there praise the Living God and he says when I speak the sheep hear the voice now the Sheep has a life praise the Lord the Sheep has a life and because the shepherd is in the door and who is the door and who is the shepherd Jesus Christ and he says when I speak so now when he speaks the Sheep is able to recognize or to hear the voice because there is a connection between the ship and the shepherd praise the Lord there is a nature that connects the ship and the shepherd praise the Lord so now the Sheep must have the life must have must bear the nature and likeness of the shepherd that's why when the shepherd calls you are able to hear the ship is able to hear because in the ship is a life that can recognize the voice of the shepher that's why when there are other animals and when the shepherd calls the other animals are not able to recogn that this is the voice of Our Shepherd because in them there is no life that is able to recognize the voice of the shepherd but he says I know mine I know my sheep and whoever the father has given me as a sheep I shall lose none when I call when I speak they shall come and they shall enter into the flock and then he says when they enter the flock then he comes upon the door and he lays his life at the door as a Good Shepherd protecting that which the father has given him and then he says as long as the father has given them and they in my FL I shall lose none praise the Lord so now he becomes our life the sacrifice of our life so as long as the shepherd is at the door taking charge of the flock we know that we are safe and we shall not get lost praise the Lord but there is only one thing only one thing we must be able to hear the voice recognize the voice obey the voice and follow the voice of the say that when he calls that there is danger we able to hear and run back to the flock because it's only in his flock that we are safe prise the Living God and says they hear my voice and when I call they shall come and follow me where he leads they follow praise the Lord being a sheep when I hear his voice when you hear his voice you follow him so where he leads you you will follow go with him and there is a songor that says I will go with him through the garden I'll go with him through sorrow through grief through judgment I go with him all the way because he is The Shepherd of my soul because I am sheep I will go wherever he leads praise the Lord I will go wherever he leads and each time he calls I will answer each time he calls I will hear and I will answer I will go wherever he leads me praise the Lord and now Jesus warns us of the end time confusion where many shall come in the flock where many shall come and he calls them wolves to try to divert the flock but as long as we have the voice of the Shepherd no matter how hard s tries as long as we are hearing the voice as long as we are following the voice praise the Lord as long as we are going by the voice of the shepherd we shall not get lost praise the Lord he says in the end times so many things shall happen and he says in Matthew chapter 24 verse3 it says and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and at the end of the world and at the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto them take he that no man deceive you praise the Lord take he be careful that no man deceive you and says for many shall come in my [Music] name verse men shall come in my name I am the shepherd I am the Good Shepherd that takes care of the flock that lays my life down for the Sheep as a sacrifice for their safety says but in the early times take he that no man deceive you because so many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ I shall receive many and says many false prophets shall arise 11 and shall receive many and then says because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall work SC be careful because in the end times there are so many Shepherds that shall come praise the Lord but now he describes himself as the Good Shepherd many Shepherds will come praise the Lord that shall put on that image as Christ but he says be careful that they deceive you not because when they shall come they shall say we are the Christ the anointed ones and they shall receive many say there shall be so many false prophets so there be so many Devils shall come to the EV the ship shall come to scatter the sheep from the flock praise the Lord but he says be careful praise the Lord because when they come they shall be anointed he says they shall say we are the Christ that means they shall have the anointing the anointing to teach the anointing to do miracles do so many great things but says be careful that they do not deceive you praise the Lord because the Bible tells us that even Satan himself lufer himself he has the ability to condescend into the angel of Light that he presents himself as the angel of Light see so many praise the Lord and Jesus warned us so many of the things will happen in the end times but it says be careful that you are not deceived praise the Lord second Corinthians 11 verse3 for as a for such a false Apostles he calls them false Apostles de sightful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ but no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an Ang of light praise the Lord with one reason with the purpose of the inverting the truth bringing doctrines of men and diverting people from the truth word of God theying people from following the voice of the shepherd but Jesus warns us and says he is the only good shepherd and only his voice must we hear and follow praise the Lord because where is he leading us he is leading us home where is he leading us he is leading us to himself he leads us with the word where the other false Apostles the other false prophets the false Christ the false Shepherds they lead us to man doctrines only the voice of the Good Shepherd Jesus Christ that leads us to the word and it's only in the word that we are S I am the Good Shepherd and all my sheep know my voice praise the Lord and when if they know my voice even in the end times there are so many voices that are coming on the scene to they the ship praise the Lord the ship that belongs to Christ Christ says as long as God has gotten you and brought you to him says will be faithful I am a very good shepherd and I will not lose you so even in the confusion of voices when there are so many voices of shepherds the sheep that God has called himself shall be in position to recognize only one voice the voice of the Good Shepherd the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ because my sheep know my voice and only his voice do they recognize are you able to recognize the the voice of the shepherd because there are so many christs there are so many false prophets there are so many teachers of the word praise the Lord but when you listen you are able to know that this is the voice of the Good Shepherd this is not the voice of the good shepher so you will not follow the voice of other Shepherds you shall only follow the voice of the good Shepherds my sheep know my voice and the prophet says the message communion 1962 now if you're are communing with God in taking the real communion because people take so many other communions but he says if you're communing with God in his word by taking the real communion the spirit is in the spirit in you disagrees with his word you are not communing with God you're communing with Devils praise the Lord if the spirit in you disagrees with the word of God and yet you confess that you are communing with God that you are following God the prophet says you are communing with Devils because so many Devils shall show up in the early times they shall teach people so many things praise the Lord but how are we able to identify them at the end they disagree with the word of God praise the Lord but the true spirit of God is in agreement with every word of God prise lord so he says you are communing with other Devils they are so impersonating and the B said in the last days they would almost deceive the very elected if possible the Paul teaches us where we've read in in in 2 Corinthians chapter 11 Satan himself became the angel of Light Satan himself Lucifer becomes the angel of Light deceive to impersonate praise the Lord but in him is no light praise the Lord he says in the last days they would even deceive the very elected if possible but the elect has the word the El has the word from the beginning the El has the seed of the word praise the Lord as long as that seed is in there you can never get lost praise the Lord because the seed in there has life and that life is in agreement with the word of God that life has the ability to hear the voice of the Good Shepherd so now even when these other voices come yes you shall hear them but you shall not follow them because they don't speak life to your soul praise the Lord but when you hear the word the word of the Good Shepherd you feel there is life in the word and that word speaks life speaks life to the word that is in your heart and he says heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not that word which you have received this true word of God as long as it abides in you it shall abide forever so now Heaven and Earth shall pass away but that word in you can never pass away shall live praise the Lord forever because that life that word is actually Christ himself praise the Lord so it is now that life in us that will help us to hear the voice of the shepher praise the Lord that life in us will help us to identify the true voice of the Good Shepherd only that voice shall we follow say as Paul said in Gans an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel than this that you've already heard let him be a c even an angel in the in the early church when those men like St Martin IRAs those Godly men when the devil would appear like an angel of Light you watch he will be a little bit off the word praise the Lord he shall be a little bit off the word he may look so close to the word somehow he shall be a little bit of the words and how are you able to identify it because you have the words and the word that you have must identify the true words when you hear that voice praise the Lord and what is that voice that voice is the true word of God that voice is the voice of Jesus Christ that voice is Jesus Christ himself praise the Lord so he says they they shall speak but somehow they shall go off the word and he says he appeared to Eve as an Ang of light he appeared to EV as an angel of Light told her the Lord said this the Lord said this he disagreed with God right at the end and that's the way false communion does today when people think they are praying to God obey the word it is a false communion if you out there you say you pray to God you say you believe God you say you a good Christian but then you disagree with one bit of the words praise the Lord it is a false communion you aren't communing with God you are communing with Devils because if you're communing with God you shall take God his word shall be in agreement the word of God and says if you abide in me and my word abide in you then ask what you will see it will be done now it just can't go one time the next you abide in me my words abide in you that is it stay right there abide means to rest there stay right there praise the Lord stay right in the word if the word abides in you it can't abide in you today then tomorrow it is off it has to abide in you once and for all it has to rest in there and you also have to rest in the word so now you can't hear the voice today and then you believe it and you said that is the truth and then tomorrow again you hear the same voice speaking something and then you say but there somehow I don't believe it you are not communing with God are communing with Devils because you're communing with God you shall rest in his words and you shall take every word that God speaks praise the Lord and then he says now let me close in saying this one word and says the blood and the body of the Lord mixed with faith the blood and the body of the Lord mixed with faith that is the blood and the body that is the spirit and the word mixed with faith equals eternal life he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I raise him up at the last day there you are that is it the communion of the Lord the word and the spirit this life is in the blood and the word and the spirit equals eternal life and you receive it by by faith in the and then he says here is my prayer as I see the end approaching and see at any minute something could happen I know that we are not far off from the coming of the lord lord then in the name of the Lord Jesus the son of God let me take the word The Sword and weave it with the Faith with what faith I have and cut my way through every demon power I see Jesus by the communing of his word says commune with his word commune with the word of God if you abide in me commun with his words you abide in me and my word in you ask me what you will and it will be done for you there is real communion with the world and the spirit with faith to it together ask what you will and it will be done praise the Lord you commune with the word you abide in the words you believe the words and so you abide in the words then the word abides in you you believe the word of God then the word of God rests in your heart it rest in your soul then you begin depending upon the word you begin communing with the word nothing else but you're being led by the word because that word is the voice of the shepherd praise the Lord abide in me and I in you praise the Lord abide in me in other words follow my word believe my word live by my word walk by my word my word in you and then when you ask anything it shall be given unto you why because you are communing with the word and that's right the Life of Christ in you produces that life it produces Holiness it produces peace praise the Lord and then he says ask of anything and it shall be given to you why because you have the word which word has everything that you desire which word has life which word has protection which word has healing so because you live in the word you live by the word and the word lives in you if you speak anything it says it shall be done why because you abide in him you abide in the words you are in him his flock praise the Living God and now because you are in his flock praise the Lord now you have his word and you believe every word when he speaks you hear and you answer you don't believe something today tomorrow you say you don't believe it praise the Lord means you don't commune with him but true communion means taking God at his word taking his word and leing his word and living by his word hearing his voice and following his voice and going by his voice praise the Lord and what is the voice the voice of the Lord is the Lord himself and that is his word living by the word of God praise the Lord hearing the word doing what the word says do praise the Lord that is believing the word that is following the word so he says in the end times so many false teachers will come so many false prophets will come so many false Christ will come and they shall deceive so many but it says hold first to the voice of the Good Shepherd hold first The Voice by which you have been called hold fast to the word of God praise the Lord he says as long as you hold there and you AB in that word there is no way you'll be shaken there is no way you will be lost praise the Lord he says I shall lose none long as they are holding into the words and theyy in the words he say I shall raise up at last day so he shall lose none of us as long as we've had the voice and we are in the flock and we are being led by that voice praise the Lord so when Satan and makes himself the Ang of light but because you are made of a different nature you can't be part of him his voice sounds different praise the Lord he may have the Garment he may have the outer cover of of light but his voice shall not sound the same as the voice of the Good Shepherd praise the Lord so when he speaks you are able to know that he is not the voice of the shepherd because you are sheep and you can only recognize a sheep voice the voice of the shepherd so he may try to copy and be exactly like the shepherd but certainly the word in you which is the seed the life of God will not agree with him because he won't agree with him because God the god in you cannot agree with Satan praise the Lord and so as long as you have that word that is our security that is your security in those times of distress in those times of false teachers and false prophets which times we are Living Praise the Lord the Ang of light he come can't agree with the word so you can't agree with him and all the false anointed prophets will not agree with the word because they don't have the life in there to believe the word praise the Lord they are men Pleasers that's what the B says they are men Pleasers but the true seed of God is identified by their OB Obi to the word of God how do you are able to identify that you are a seed is by your obedience to the word of God praise the Lord so if someone is not obedient to the word of God they don't have the life of God in them and he says they shall confess to be Christ but as long as they don't have the Life of Christ in them life is in obedience in agement with the word they are false prophets and Paul says in in Galatians 18 even if they come in form of angels but speak another gospel different from this which we have told you he says let them be a c and he says if me and you see me coming back when I am speaking another gospel which is different from this which we have spoken to you he says let me be a cur because Jesus said so many false prophets will come so many false Christ will come if they can take on the form of Jesus Christ they can still take on the form of Paul that's why Paul said even if I come back because he was convinced that he had the Life of Christ he had the word of God he had the seed of life so that se in him not contradict with the word of God that's why he says even if it were me I come and teach something different Let Me Be A C in other words don't believe me c me out praise the Lord why because he is very confident that the true seed of God will be able to discern be able to recognize the voice and know that this is the truth and they shall go by the truth praise the Lord but they that are not known of him they shall fall the false unknown why because the life in them is not able to recogize the voice and discern between the voices of the Good Shepherd and the voices of the other Shepherds praise the Living God says they are obedient and that the nature of the sheep they don't add on or take away from the word they just follow what the word says the ship just follows what the shepher says the shepherd is leading they shall come following praise the Lord no matter where the shepherd goes if the shepherd goes to the bush they shall fall to the bush their nature is obedience to the leadership of the shepherd and that is the nature that we have the nature that we are given of Christ is the nature of obedience to the leadership of the holy spirit so where the spirit says go where he leads us there we shall go and there is a song WR that says praise the lord we shall go wherever he asks us to go even if it's a hard way we shall go the hard way because we know know that he has no bad plans for us praise the Lord so if it means going through the fire we shall go through the fire is going through the flood we shall go through the flood as long as he's in the lead we shall follow him because our nature is the nature of the sheep that is obedient to following the voice of the master praise the lord we shall follow our hearts courageous and say should you lead us where the battle rages we shall still march with our hearts courageous unto him why because our nature is made to follow him wherever he leads us you don't say no here no here is very hard for me to bear I can't contain it if you are a sheep you be obedient and you shall stay right there and wait for the next step praise the Lord so when he's leading you through the flag you are there and you are waiting upon him to show you the next cause of action so if he's standing right there you also stand right there and allow him do his will then when he takes you to the fire in the fire you depending upon him you're waiting upon him and you're waiting to see where next he is going so if he leads you through it you go his way that's why the Hebrew children praise the Lord they had the Life of Christ they were a sheep praise the Lord so when Calamity came and the only way of their was to pass through the fire because they had the nature of ship they stood right there and says if it is fire he's leading us is leading us and this is where he's taking us we shall go his way because we are confident that he has no bad plans for us so now they moved and they moved to the fire praise the Lord and in the fire he was there with them and it is him who still L them out of the fire and while they were in the fire the Bible says not even smoke tou their garments why because the Good Shepherd was there with them in the fire and as long as he's there with you in the fire the fire shall not touch you he shall not stop the fire from burning he shall allow it to burn because it is meant to burn but that fire shall not touch you praise the Lord so we shall go with our heart courageous unto him should he lead us through the floods should he lead us through sorrow should he lead us through pain we shall March with our heart courageous to him because our nature is to follow his leadership my sheep know my voice and that's how he's able to recognize his she when he speaks they hear and they answer and when he says they say Amen because they are sheep and they are obedient to every word that comes out of his mouth my sheep know my voice and we are his sheep praise the lord we are his sheep and if we hear his voice let's go by his voice praise the Lord not complaining believing his word believing every step of the way leing every Journey that he takes us through with not complaining but believing unto him praise the Lord and and the prophet says in the message Hebrews chapter 6 and 7 197 says and the man that is Bor of the spirit of God becomes a dve of God a dve of God his nature his change his makeup yes you put the spirit of the dve in the crow he would never sit on a dead ccass If he if he lit down by mistake he would certainly get away quick he couldn't stand in and the man that born of the spirit of God don't it you in there light a but he will get out of there quick a woman May entice him him turn around but he will turn his head again he will get away from there quick why he is a dve you ain't going to pull him because that he knows my sheep know my voice and the voice of the master is continuously calling like we heard last Wednesday that the voice of the blood keeps on crying out it keeps on calling because the Good Shepherd became the sacrifice the good shepher laid himself up as a as a sacrifice for us then his blood that comes out of him that blood is what claims each one of us and covers each one of us praise the Lord so the prophet says that he may get yourself in the wrong place but each time you hear the voice there still small voice the voice of the Shepherd in your heart you can't settle there shall R right straight back to the flock because your nature is not meant to be there it's meant to be into the FL my sheep know my voice praise the Lord and the stranger they will not follow he is a dve um to begin with that's what I'm speaking about the actual something that anchors in there that's right and when they that are not of the FL come and try to imitate it they won't last there they are men Pleasers bers lovers of themselves more than lovers of God they take time to talk about what befits them and what benefits them more than building the kingdom of God men shall be lovers of themselves that's the Bible says in the end times praise the Lord it says men shall be lovers of themselves disobedient boastful reject the truth praise the Lord because the truth makes them comfortable praise the Lord but yet the ship is very comfortable with that truth praise the Lord why because she has nothing else to do to obey and believe that's her nature obey and believe praise the Lord now the those praise the Lord that talks about that are disobedient that don't Point people or don't Point themselves towards Christ but Point people does of men with which people believe with which people are pleased with he says be aware of them they begin to preach does of men when they begin to preach does of men rather than pointing the people to Christ then you know they are false they have a false anointing because the true anointing of Jesus Christ points the people to Christ praise the Lord but now the false anointing shall Point people something else and not until Christ praise the Lord so now they begin to preach doctrines Bible calls them the doctrines of men they begin to preach what are those doctrines the baptism not in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord but the baptism Father Son and Holy Spirit yet it was not so praise the Lord from the beginning of the Apostles they begin to deny the scriptures they said now here there is something wrong there was an interesting evening yesterday when I came back to office I found my brother and then my sister Beck was there they have a friend I just bumped into them and they were speaking something about about the Trinity and about God and the Bible and then I came in they all kept quiet and I told them you are choking me I told him me I'm a preacher and now I'm going to start from where you've ended and now the young man he has been seeing me in a different perspective he has just been there for three days I told them I'm not going to sit this young man has asked a question about baptism about the godhead and I told him young man I am going to start from there and I told him let us go back to Genesis chapter 1 and we started from Genesis chapter 1 and we ended up in Revelations and then at the end of the sermon of around two to three hours he says which means I must be baptized again I must be baptized again and I told him yes you must be baptized again and then he said oh that means all along these Apostles and these pastors been teaching the wrong word I told him yes because B says in the end there shall be false teachers false prophets and I told him I have not said anything outside the word every word which I have spoken I was quoting for the Bible and you read it and the Bible became new to him it's as if he was reading it for the first time and I told him this is the truth and I told him at the end that you are blessed because the Bible says the things we are hidden from the wise and The Prudent but you are blessed because now he has revealed it unto you and now you have no excuse but believe it and then said so which means there are those who are not meant to believe I told him yeah there are those that will not believe it because maybe somehow they are not predestined to believe it and I told him but as long as you are known of God like I told you that you were with him before the beginning of the world so now if you were with him and we are part of him you shall still be with him in the end of of the times and he says so I have to be baptized then I told him yes you must be baptized and he says yes he wants to be baptized praise the Lord there are false teachers who are teaching the false Doctrine the doctrines of men they not pointing the people Jesus Christ the good shepher they're anointing they're not pointing people to the voice of the good Shepherds but they appointing the people the doctrines of men and there are so many people out there that are lost because of these teachings Jesus said if it were possible they will deceive the very elect God that it is not possible for the elect to be deceived praise the lord we know that somehow someday the elect of God will hear the voice of the Good Shepherd and when they hear the voice of the Good Shepherd they will be able to know that this is the voice of the master they shall not sit but they shall come up they shall come out into the flock to believe the true word of God abide in me and my word abides in you you rest in me I will also take my rest in you stay right in the word and take your rest praise the Lord whether I lead you to the fire whether I lead you to the fire you follow because your obligation your nature is obedience follow to the fire and white water I bring next that is the voice of the master praise the Lord should he lead us where the battle rages we shall still mat with our praise the Lord they teach the people the doctrines of men they teach that they are three gods they teach that the baptism father son Holy Spirit they teach that a woman can still stand up because everyone of us is Anointed and they nor quote the book in Joel in the last God will pour His Spirit upon young men and and upon old people and young men and young women shall prophesy praise the Lord they take the scripture interpret it and then teach the people the doctrines of men but how are we able to identify them we have the word praise the Lord you have the word even before you believe the seed of God was in there and is that seed that is able Rec organize the true word praise the Lord and our prayer is that this word out there and reaches Every Soul that was predestinated for the of the world to believe this word because not until the last of the elect comes in we shall still be so now the prayer of every saint in these trying moments in this stressful moments in these moments of peral our prayer is that this gospel goes out there to reach Every Soul to catch every bride of Jesus Christ to bring them back to the FL that when they come to the flock we shall not be here anymore but we shall be taken because the purpose of God of reconciling his back to himself shall be finished praise the Lord Romans 1 verse 21 because they are disobedient because they glorify themselves more than God we've heard many of them in the entire world they calls great men men of God great pastors healers prophets even an Abomination it's even an Abomination it is to mention their name you can't call them Pastor so and so you either supposed to call him a man of God glorifying themselves more than Jesus Christ they are not pointing people to believe Christ and Trust on Jesus Christ by they appointing people themselves glorifying themselves exalting themselves more than Jesus Christ to search turn away the voice says to search turn away because they not leading you to to to life they not leading you to eternal life but they leading you to destruction they are hipping to themselves glories instead of glorifying the only son praise the Living God and the Bible says because they had in their hearts because they hard their hearts no I'm not reading God them gave them up praise the Lord he gave them up praise the Lord because that when they knew God they glorified him not but rather glorify themselves may God help every servant of God not to glorify themselves but glorify God in everything and point people to Christ says they were thank neither were they thankful but became vain in their IM inations and their foolish heart was darkened professing to be wise they became fools praise the Lord and the prophet says you know great bright things is what blinds the eyes of the people he was looking for a new light was looking for a new light she got it why the Bible has said Satan became the angel of Light and he came to speak to Eve so now because Eve was was looking for light she found it praise the Lord because that's what she was looking for and now because these men the false teachers and false Apostles there is something they are looking for God gives them over praise the Lord if they're looking for fame they shall find it if they're looking for Glory they shall find it but then they become fools that's what the Bible says they became fools professing themselves to be wise and the Bible say in the last days the Devils would be themselves into Ministers of light look at the very first sin was ever performed Satan wanted a greater and greater Kingdom great thing and went over in the north and set his own kingdom up outshine Michael always those bright things we are not monkeys we are not monkeys monkeys is Rich after right things let's be men and women let's be men and women sit down look at the gospel see what it says and follow the leading of the Holy Spirit you will never be able to know God until the Holy Spirit comes into you said that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost if you if you'll never receive the Holy Ghost you you you you don't know what he's the Christ yet you don't that he's the Christ yet remember that you're only walking towards that light you can say my pastor said so that's true my Bible said so that's true my mother said so that's true my church believes it is the that's true but what about you as an individual you don't know until you've received it and when you receive the Holy Ghost then you are a witness that he is alive forever more now the Holy Ghost is within you now and then you watch him as he works you hear the voice and you follow that voice because the voice is coming out of you the voice is in you and when he speaks you follow that voice because that voice is the voice of the Holy Spirit if the Life of Christ is in you it will produce his life in you you shall not seek to glorify yourself but you shall seek to glorify God praise the Living God and it says in the message the lamp and the dve praise the Lord he says now I want you to notice another thing the lamb was a willing lamp to be led it was willing and God his LS are willing to be led by God Spirit my sheep know my voice and a stranger they won't follow the strangers will come praise the Lord they will speak but we know the voice of the shepherd and only his voice do we follow and when the voice shall call out our names in the last day oh not even the ground shall hold us back voice of the shepherd which is the voice of the trumpet when it shall sound the Bible says the dead in Christ arise because they died they had a life in them the voice was in them recognize the voice was in them them so when the voice shall sound the trumpet shall sound says the dead in Christ shall rise up not even the grounds have the ability to hold us back when we hear the voice we come out and even in that day those that shall be sleeping when they shall hear the voice they shall come out to follow the voice they shall come up and shall be C up with the Lord in the air my sheep know my voice wherever they are as long as they hear the voice they run quickly to the master because my sheep know my voice and another message about the little eag and Mother E the message the ego in her nest now when we notice this old H every time she would find a little b or something she cl to herck little chickens all the little chickens come then the little e come in the back looking around because it was not recognizing the nature he was a f looking little creature but you know one day she happen to be out in theard feeding and the old mother happen to fly by and as she flew by and great Shadow swept over over the top of the Bard she looked down the mother Eagle looked down and she seen her own and he knows his voice and she screamed to him praise the Lord so now the prophet talks about the story of the eagle and the iglet the iglet had been lost because that the farmer got the egg and brought it and and it HED together with the chicken and now the iglet was always feeding together with the chicken it was always isolated so now he says some point when the mother the mother could Now look for food and then when he got it he could throw it for the chicken but now these chicks would eat by the iglet theet could not understand it and then he says one day she was moving behind the cheeks and then there was the mother up there then when the mother looked down with his big eyes he was able to locate the iglet and when she saw him the prophet says she screamed she screamed from a distance because she knew this little e had the life praise the Lord he had the nature to be able recogize the voice of mother eag so when she screamed the prophet says the little fellow turned his head and begin to look upward my she know my voice when he speaks they hear so the little e was able to hear and he looked up that's the way he ought to have been looking all the time and when he looked up she screamed back and she said Son you are not a chicken you are mine that is the voice of the sheer he says you don't belong there you don't belong to domination you don't belong to those organizations you belong here in the world praise the Lord you are mine I am so glad that God is God children all works of Life bus whatever they may be God knows his own and when they hear the gospel of the power of Jesus Christ they know that voice why because my sheep know my voice and now Satan may try so much squeeze the nature out of us by giving us lots of worries by giving us lots of Pleasures making us to sh up the pleasures of the world trying to squeeze the love out of us trying to divert us and us out praise the Lord into the lust of the Flesh and all these kind of things but you won't last there long when you hear the voice of the Good Shepherd you say here I am then you begin to follow him where he leads me I will follow I will go with him through the garden I'll go with him through the Judgment I'll go with through the fire I'll go with him through death I go with him and he shall lead me all the way because the purpose of creation the purpose of God is to bring us to himself and see us into eternity his purpose is not to call us to leave us here in church his purpose is to call us give us his word give us his life produce that life out of us at the end of the day that life produces eternal life out of Us Praise the Lord that when he calls us we shall be able to hear our names and we shall be able to join him will be taken eternity praise the Lord he says I will accept him but I won't let him in this little place because I have been this way since I was a child because I have been this since I was a child now I feel like I'm just a little bit over them I'll let Jesus in but I'll never go to one of them little old missions one of those places where they all amen and glory to God and Hallelujah I will let Jesus in but I won't go to there I won't go to their place if you do that if you hear the voice and say yet I have known the truth but I won't go there Jesus isn't your Lord because if he's your lord he is your Good Shepherd is no good shepherd when he speaks his sheep must hear his voice and they must go the way of the shepherd so if you say I will hear him today but no I will not do this no I won't do this he isn't your Lord because if he is your lord you be obedient to his voice sh he my voice then he is your lord he is your ruler he will let you will let him in and take him praise the Lord and he says I don't care if they put if I wanted to go into the Bard wherever he wanted me to go I would want I would want to go as long as he's calling me I let him in on the grounds that he's my Lord praise the Lord I will let him in on the grounds that he's my Lord when whatever he wants to do let him do it just keep following him wherever he leads you just keep going by his wherever he leads because he's a good shepherd and sure he will not let none of his sheep to get lost wherever he leads you follow his voice wherever he calls you go when he sends you go praise the Lord all the father has given me will come to me and all that will come to me I will know is cast out but I'll give him everlasting life and though the Undertaker him in the ground The Undertaker puts him in the ground he may he my sheep will hear my voice and raise him up at the last day because my sheep he my voice and that day all that is in the grave shall hear the voice of the great Shepherd and shall come forth Hallelujah come forth Everlasting that great day of the coming of the shepher Sorrows of Tears can never keep the shepherd away Sorrows of Tears can never keep the shepherd away corruption he proved it at the grave of Lazarus Lazarus was one of his little lambs and he was laying in the bottom of a pit a stone roll over it his body was molded the nose had dropped in the skin worms were eating him up the Sheep Shepherd come up to the Grave he knows his Sheep by name and if he speaks your name now and calls you you answer for there is going to be a time say the prophet that he will call and I will answer him Lazarus was four days dead his body was corrupted but the shepherd spoke and Corruption knew its Master saw that was four days journey back into the body body that had been emed it had been Ed no blood the cells was broke he was rot in the grave by the shepher of Life spoke the name of his lamb and his lamb let out a bleed and said here I am he's a marvelous Shepherd let him feed you he will feed you on his word the Holy Spirit leads by the word of God that shepher will feed you he will feed you on his word and he will not let any of us to see corruption he is a good shepherd and when he speaks you'll be able to hear and answer here I am because my sheep know my voice and even the previous times still a good Shepherd and he shall be there to take care of his sheep in times of Sorrow he's a Good Shepherd in times of sickness he's a Good Shepherd in times of distress he is a good shepherd and when he speaks let us be able to hear his voice and say here I am and whenever he leads us let us follow because that's our nature the nature of the ship may the Lord bless you amen amen my sheep knows my voice and
