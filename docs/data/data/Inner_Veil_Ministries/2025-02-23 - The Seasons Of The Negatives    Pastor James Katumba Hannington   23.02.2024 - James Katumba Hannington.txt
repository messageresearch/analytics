[Music] the life is easy when you're up the mountain oh because you got peace of mind like you never [Music] know oh but things change when you're down in the [Music] valley that's where your fth [Music] is really put to the T the of the still call in the oh when for go WR he make him I'm the god of the good is still in [Music] the god of is still God in [Music] the now you talk of f when

tear for the still when things go strong [Music] the the god of the day [Music] oh the god of the mountain mountain [Music] coming make them am the god of the mountain is still the god of the valley praise the name of our Lord you know when the children of Israel went to war and then they defeated the the Syrian Army because the battle was on the mountain so when the syrians got defeated they came and told their King you know the god of Israel the god of the m so that's why they defeated us because the the the temple was on the mountain and then they would go to the mountain to pray so they on the Hills I think that's why they are strong then they Syrian arm advised the king let us restore all the army that we lost and every equipment and now let us go and attack Israel in the valley and you know that time was the king of Israel a very Wicked King but now when they talked about the name of God that is only the god of the mountain and is not the god of the valley then God said no I have to show them that I'm the god of the valley praise the name of then the Bible says the syrians covered the whole place but Israel were just like small groups of gods but God came and they defeated the Syrian because it's the same God praise the name of our the god of the mountain the god of the V the god of the good times is the god of the B the god of the day the god of the night praise the name of the god when things are all good is the same God when everything is upside praise the name of so let us stand up to us to stand up and go to our Bibles we are going to read in the Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 3 from verse 1 to verse 8 praise the name of our Lord pray before we read us pray father we thank you for this opportunity again that your word is alive and in every situation your word applies therefore pray you may come and speak to us through Thy word to help us in the time of need that we are going through that bless us all together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ us this amen so eclesiastes 8 verse 3 verse 1 to the Bible says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven to be born and a time to die it's time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mour and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a Time refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to rent and a time to s a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of and a time of [Music] Peace amen word so I want to preach on the subject the seasons of the negatives praise the name of the Lord seasons and then there are negatives or things that are not pleasant praise the name of Lord they are not pleasant but they love to come that's what the Bible is telling us scripture is telling us that there is a time or a season for everything a time to every purpose under the Heaven There is a time when we are born and then there is a time when we die a time when we are born what a joy what a gladness that you have been born but yet there is a time when the Natural Life comes to un and then it's a time of Sorrow a time of regret it's a season of negative then he says a time to plant and a time to plant up that which is planted It's Time to Kill and a time to he a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mour and a time to dance so then there are STS that keep on coming in life and those STS that come that we Face make us to react in a certain way the of like when a child is born in a family it will bring joy and when a person dies in a family it brings sorrowfulness depression uncertainties when a person achieves in a family everybody rejoices everybody wants to talk about that but then when somebody loses some Fails Like recent' been having the examinations of and for coming a child passes it is such a joy praise the name of our Lord at the school and even the family but now if a child doesn't do well it's not pleasant so now the scripture is telling us there is a season to everything and there is a time for every purpose praise the name of our and then we see that God has created them like that praise the name of our Lord but then we see much as we can have the positive you know the things that are Pleasant the things that make us so glad the things that you know we esteem highly the things that you tget to achieve like a businessman you know a businessman is looking at how we can get profit but then in that same business they also risks you know the things you're not sure about s can come and break down your shop if you're maybe a farmer you know something can happen maybe the weather becomes so terrible and then you make a loss or even F can come or maybe the market goes down and then you said this season have made a loss but it doesn't mean that you because made the loss in this season the next you can't make a profit you know so because it is a cyc you know something that repeats praise the name of the Lord you know it's just like something cirular when it is rolling one point it is up at one point it is up and then that thing can also come down and then it keeps on moving like as we were Tau last Sunday you know the shadows in the cycle praise the name of our Lord so something negative is unpleasant it is depressing sometimes can be harmful it can be terrible it can be tough it can be it can be sorrowful it can be bad it can be rejected it be it can be destructive unfavorable you know undes God permits those to come in our way praise the name of the Lord now in the Book of Genesis 8 and then verse 22 the Bible says while the Earth remain Genesis 8:22 while the Earth remainers seed time and harvest and cold and Heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not CE now you look at these things he says there is a SE time time to to S the sea and then the scripture says they go when they are sewing let us speak that scripture here praise the name of our Lord let me get it here during the time when you are sewing the Bible says let us go to the scripture here it's in the book of Psalms 126 Psalms 126 and then verse verse 5 shall reap in Joy he that go forth and weepth bearing precious seed shall doubtlessly come again with rejoicing bringing his f with him so he says the seed time is a weeping time is kind of like un Pleasant time but then if you are going to do the Harvest you need to go into this sewing but then he saying sewing you are bearing precious seed now it's as if you are losing your seat you know like taking your children to school and then they start crying you know and then you feel that that kind of you know burden I don't want my children to be aware from me but the more you keep them your children around Yourself Praise the name of because they not going to live in your house all the time to prepare them for the times ahe and so it's the same thing in sewing you are preparing yourself for the Times ahead where there will be necessity so he says that se time and harest time shall not Cee and then he says cold and heat shall not CE so when and then you know the wetness the coldness now look at what we are going through but this is not the end it will also get over and the other one comes another cycle coming then he says summer and winter here we don't know what winter is praise the name of our Lord we've never seen snow around or our temper going below zero but those people who go through that can know what exactly is and then he says day and night shall not see just as we have the day now know that the night is coming praise the name of our Lord you know during day you don't need the during day praise the name of our Lord you don't need to be so why because you are seeing the light you are seeing the light you are seeing where you going but it's a time of being careful in the Book of John chapter 11 and then verse the Bible says Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in the day if a man walk in the day he shall not he stumbles not because he sees the light of the world he stumbles because there is no light in him praise the name of the Lord it says when you walk during that time this hide behind you know banana plants know if you move at night you know in a place where there is a lot of banana plantation and coffee and then the night dancers do you know that there are mod night dancers in town they also night dancers but for them they have built for them a big hole where they danc same spirits that make them not go to sleep those in the village who live running naked going hold Same Spirit so when you walk in the day 2 the scripture talks about four Gentile kingdoms it started with the bonian Empire which was the head of God praise the name of Lord then from the Babylonian Empire then it went to the to thean and you know Kingdom and you know that was now the the hands the shoulder silver and then from thean and median Kingdom it went now to the Greek Kingdom and now the Greek kingdom was know the stomach and the thighs you know of brass and then now it goes to the feet and the toes of iron and clay and that is the Roman Empire and I can say according to the scriptures are still living under the Roman Empire according to the scriptures and it is that the time of the Roman Empire that Christ came the first time and still at the time of the Roman Empire that Christ comes the second time to pick his bride and now when Christ comes the third time he comes to destroy the Roman Empire so we are under the Roman Empire and now the Roman Empire is a religious system right now in the days of Christ it was the Emperors but in the religious time it the pop praise the name of our so now we see here that you know God our Lord Jesus Christ was telling disciples when they were telling him when you restore the kingdom to Israel in other words to the divinely given king of God you know the king to Ru over them who is not under any leadership not under the leadership of the emperor not under the leadership of the pops but under the leaders ship of God himself they were asking when is the time of restoration Jesus Christ told them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons God has the power to determine the B praise the name of the Lord so now when we are going through our seasons of negatives you know things that are not pleasant all the power is in the hands of praise the name of our Lord then verse 8 it tells but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and shall be Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria unto the utmost part of the Earth so instead of them being afraid of the times and the seasons Christ was now pointing them that what you need in the season which you are going through is you need the holy spirit that will give you the power to go through dist praise the name of our Lord and that's the same thing that we need also we need the power of God to help us go through times of uncertainity we need the presence of God Seven compound Redemptive names Jehovah was onef Jehovah man Shi man and then now so he says seven Redemptive names that the Lord would appear to the people according to the need that they hadise the name of when Abraham was on the mountain and then God told him sacrifice Isaac your son and then when God saw Abraham going to cat Isaac told him don't do that what did the Lord do he provided lamb for the sacrifice because God needed the sacrifice what did he do he provided it praise the name of the Lord so God is Jehovah is God the provider so when you have necessities is Jehovah G and you call him upon his name no this is my need does he he provides when you are at unrest God Shalom when you don't know where to go God is Jehovah you know the shepher praise the name of the Lord is your Shepherd the Bible says the Lord is my shepher so I depend upon his leadership praise the name of when I'm sick God is Jehovah Rafa the Healer he heal all my diseases when I'm in sin God God our righteousness prise the name of our Lord so he gives me the righteousness praise the name of our Lord when I'm under battles God the Lord our our Victory the god of hosts God Mighty in battle what are you going through God is mighty in the battle so you just call him in that situation come over my condition Lord overcome over what ising Jehovah praise the name of when you feel that you are alone forsaken god Jehovah the Lord is present praise the name of our Lord now let us go back again in the book of Philippians 3: Philippians 3 ver the Bible says for our conversation is in heaven from when also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says our citizenship is in heaven so we are on this land it's a journey that we are taking and when you are on a journey the scener keeps on changing it keeps on changing sometimes you're on the mountain sometimes you're in the valley sometimes you're in the forest sometimes you're in the town sometimes you in a swamp area sometimes you're in a rock place it's a pilgrimage but God determines the times of each of those things when you're going to go through this when you're going to go through this when you're going to go through this when you're going to go through and now as we go through those things the Bible says we live in V bodies in verse 21 who shall change our v body that it may be fion like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he's able to subdue all things unto himself the Bible says we live in Vile bodies there bodies of humiliation are bodies that areow bodies of failure they are bodies of weakness the bodies that we living now you add the condition of the body and then you add on the condition of the environment we are living and then you see that the negative season they can be a div Upon Us Praise the name of our they can be so frightening they can be so kind of like distressful like John the Baptist John the Baptist he got the baptism of the Holy Spirit when he was in his mother's wom and he had such a powerful Ministry that this man was preaching in the desert on the rivers he was not preaching in the town people would walk from the town and they would go to the rivers or in the desert John preach praise the name of our so highly anointed praise the name of our but the time came that the season of his ministry had come to an end so what happened he was arrested he put in prison unpleasant Place unpleasant season and when he was in the prison and he had the disciples tell him about Jesus Christ what did John tell them go and ask him if he the one but he the one who introduced Christ praise the name of the Lord let us go in the scripture here in the Book of John John chapter 1 and then verse 29 the next day John sees Jesus coming unto him and says Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore I'm come baptizing with water now you see this he's recognizing his ministry that why I was sent to introduce Jes but now the ministry is over is now doubting whether that was Christ praise the name of the Lord then he says and I knew him not verse 32 and John be record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a d and it AB upon him and knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou sh see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is which bapes with the Holy Ghost and I bear record that this is the son of and next day after stood two of the disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God praise the name of you look at the of John filled with the Holy Spirit called to be a prophet born the promise praise the name of the Lord but now when the conditions change he started wondering are you the Christ praise the name of he started wondering what is this now if John would get into such a situation how about you and me praise the name of the Lord if John would do such a thing in the message forgotten beatitude the he says so we find out here that the devil tries to make the people believes disel so the devil is trying to get John to disbel he was the Messiah so he got two of his disciples and sent them out and say you go out and find we he he's the one preaching and when you do go out and ask him have I been wrong could you imagine that I could have been wrong is it really the same one I know the sign was right I seen the mesiah sign I know what was right but this me and lowly I don't get it I can't figure it up I can't make end me with it and then brother Bram says you're not supposed to make ends meat praise the name of so he was wondering is he the one or we look for another seasons of negatives now in Luke chap 7 and then verse 19 and John calling unto him to his disciples sent them to Jesus saying at though he that should come or we look for another Luke 7:19 l when the men came unto him saying they said John the Baptist has sent us unto the same that though he that should come or will look for another praise the name of the Lord Jesus just told them stay for the meeting and then they show the manifestation of the spirit of God the sick being heal the lame walking blind and then he sent them away go and tell joh what you have seen and so when we are in the seasons of negatives praise the name of our Lord that's the time you need to think about the goodness of What the Lord Has Done For praise the name of our Lord It's the time to start testifying about the goodness of God how the Lord has brought me this how the Lord has saved my soul how the Lord has delivered him from so many things and you don't allow Satan to make you focus on the negatives you are living in the night don't be scared praise the name of the Lord no sure the night will come to that's what the scripture says you know I always wondered let us go to Psalms 112 and then verse four the Bible says unto the upright there arises light in the darkness so the upright living in the darkness it may be a darkness of your it may be a of uncertainity something you know living in the darkness you know it's just like at home if you want to sit in a place you look for FL is unless when you want to sleep that's when in a place where there's no light but naturally our body are attracted to light but now when you are living in darkness very unpleasant you can't do much Darkness brings Gloom you know sorrowfulness you know it you can't be happy in darkness no praise the name of you can't but now the Bible says when you are living in darkness un Pleasant time the Bible says light arises when you're in darkness so you look what the darkness around the scripture says light arises praise the name of then says he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous that's what we need when there was darkness in the mind of John light AR praise the name of and then he had confidence that I know he is the Messiah praise the name of our Simon say praise the name of when he saw the Lord is Christ he said let your servant depart inace because the promise has been fulfilled now when we are going through situations that are difficult you need to know the Lord is the master of all conditions prise the name of he Masters tion so you shouldn't be dismayed in uncertainties the things that you don't understand you just need to be strong praise the name of our Lord and you know PA said when I am weak then I am strong praise the name of our Lord in 2 Corinthians 12 verse 9 verse 10 1 Corinthians 2 Corinthians 12 ver9 vers 10 he says and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for you now in every condition we go through in weakness when you can't help yourself then you know if anything this has been the Lord praise the name of our this has been God working this has been God protecting this has been God delivering God opening that door this has been God coming to my rescue you just need to have that testimony and then you need to confess that even if I'm going through this kind of like job when he was going through hard time his confession was I know my redeemer Liv praise the name of our Lord so in every situation you need to acknowledge God praise the name of our Lord that is ever present to help in the circumstance I'm going praise the name of our Lord then he says most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me oh blessed be the name of he said I don't fear them now why I know God is with me he will give me Grace to overcome he will make me strong when I am weak therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches necessities in persecutions in distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong praise the name of the Lord such times come but now when they come how do you handle them praise the name of some people when they are fearing maybe at night what do they do they would say let me get a witch doctor and then they try to put charms around their homes and then others when they are farmers they get rain makers because they are put into pressure others when they are baren they go to which doctors different things and the devil always comes there to minister to you what to do the devil is always there to tell you this tell you this now you don't have money why are you going to church you the business is here why you wasting time doing this the devil always keeps on [Music] coming pressing against you giving you wrong suggestions doing this doing this now in 2 Corinthians 6:4 it says but in all things approving ourselves as Ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in Necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tlets in labors in watchings in fastings praise the name of the Lord it says we go through all these unpleasant things but God gives us Grace when we in those kind of Seasons praise the name of our Lord he comes down and gives us strength he comes and encourages Us Praise the name of our Lord the Lord says I'm a very present help in trouble in Psalms 46 verse1 he says God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble Psalms 46 verse1 verse one to verse three he says God is our refuge is very present in other words all the time is our refuge all the time God is our strength and he says is a very present help very present in trouble so when Trouble Comes like that know that the Lord is already there so what do you do you call upon the name of the Lord and the Bible says whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved that's the time praise the name of our Lord to use that that's the time to put that in action if I'm sick then the Lord Health me if I'm afraid that the Lord is my peace praise the name of our Lord if I'm lacking the Lord is my provider so you call upon the name of the Lord based on the sttion that you are going through so he says I'm a very present help in trouble what kind of trouble are you going through what kind of season are you in a season of death a season of sickness a season of fear a season I don't have anything to do a season the Bible says is a very present help in trouble so you call upon the Lord to come in that situation and don't allow in the condition you are going through to become like the children of Israel you know the children of Israel in the wilderness they were all the time complaining all this all this all this don't allow that in your life look at the good that the Lord has done thank God for what he has done praise the name of don't look at the negative don't look at the things which are lacking don't look at the things which are disturbing you but rather glorify God for what he has done and say Lord I Thank you for this Lord I give praise to you have done this praise the name of our Lord you know the children of Israel the pillar of fire was before them the glory of God was before them but they only looked at the things they didn't have but the presence of God was always with them you can imagine the cloud and that cloud was covering their head whenever they were going it was protecting them from the Sun so you can't say the heat was getting today he provided enough environmental condition for them when it comes tonight the cloud became a pillar of fire to give them the light and the heat when it is day it's a cloud the Bible says they never had they never had clothes get worn out their shoes they never got worn out their feet they never got swollen the Lord would provide whatever they needed when they needed the water rocks would provide the water every day food would fall but then they were complaining complain complaining complaining and then for you also start complaining are you b or what praise the name of our Lord have they taken you to prison for the date or what praise the name of the Lord but God has given Grace that even those who demand you they are patient with you that's the goodness of the Lord praise the name of the Lord that they can be patient with you when you tell them this is my oh my children at school God just holds them from chasing them away that's the goodness of God and so you should always be thankful to God I thank you for this I thank you for this or maybe it may be house rent for two months or three months God makes your landlord be patient with you that's the goodness of the Lord so you don't have cause to complain oh now this this no see the goodness of the Lord in every St that you go through and learn how to glorify know it is's wife who told him God and die and then told her should we only receive good things from God and not from not evil things praise the name of Lord we just need to learn how to be thankful unto the Lord and as we are living in these bodies which are V sometimes things which are not pleasant will always come praise the name of our Lord let us go back let us go to the book of chapter 1 and then verse four the Bible says one generation passes away and another generation cometh ecclesiast chter 1 verse 4 but the Earth abideth forever The Sun Also arises and the sun goes down and to his place where he arose the wind goes toward the South and turn about unto the north it about continually and the wind return again according to his statut all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from where the rivers come from they return again all things are full of Labor man cannot it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor are the ear filled with hearing the thing that has been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun is there anything whereof may be said see this is new it has been already of all time which was before us there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of the things that to come with those who shall come after praise the name of Lord very interesting he says even what you are striving for others also do the same praise the name of but then for you you feel now if I achieve this I'll be the greatest man on Earth there are others who did that praise the name of oh I'm too strong I can run a race said finally you you'll be weak you get it so it has been it is here it will be and it keeps on repeating itself keeps on repeating itself it says there's nothing new Under the Sun the seasons we go through the times we are going through times of negatives times of positives challenging moments they have been there but how do you go through challenges praise the name of our Lord how do you go through them now in the message Dr Moses he says all scripture has a compound meaning it runs in cycles for instance there where it said in St Matthew out of Egypt I have called my son now that scripture that MTH was referring to was pertaining to Israel that was Jacob and God said out of Egypt I called my son Israel you know when they went to Egypt in captivity then he called them out but yet the same scripture refers also to Jesus Christ when was taken in Egypt then he says I've called my son out then he says the cycle of time SS back ever so often history repeats itself and scripture repeats itself down through the age and Scholars know that that's ever studed it from the spiritual standpoint to watch how the scripture will repeat itself run in Cycles like that it certainly does so that's why the Bible says what has been will be and then it keeps on coming on like that praise the name of our Lord and then brother Bram praise the name of our Lord in the message question and answers okay before we go to that let us go to the Ephesian church he says that cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is to recall this the last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to churches prayed all night took the street corners and were not ashamed of the manifestation of the spirit they left their old dead churches and woried in homes of old store building they had reality but it wasn't too long time until they be began to get enough money to build fine new churches they put a choir instead of singing unto God then he says they they they put gowns on the choir they organize the movement and R it by man they soon began to read books that were not fit to read they let down the bars and the gods entered in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone or they kept on with the form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is all about what is left now that's the thing about the spiritual part the natural and spiritual you know they type now when you go again in the scriptures in the Book of Judges chapter 2 verse 18 the Bible says and when the Lord raised up judges Judges chapter 2 verse and when the Lord raised up judges then the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers following other gods to serve them and to B down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way praise the name of the Lord so it says when the judges would come then they overcome when the judg is dead they go back to evil things again God brings another judge they overcome it was a cycle even in the church ages when the messenger goes the fire of God calls down and again God raises another messenger and on and on like that how can we break that cycle praise the name of our Lord that you know you're not only over coming on Sunday praise the name of our Lord You're Not only dressing well on Sunday when it comes to Monday I put on shorts tight I'm A working class let us break that cycle when it come to Monday I can wear Nails red yellow blue you know these days there also Nails which are silver or colorless but you wear them it's the same thing or you put clear on them it's the same Spirit we need to break that cycle praise the name of our when you are good to me I'll be good to you how about when I'm bad I'll also be bad we need to break that ccle praise the name of our Lord at home when you give me I'll be obedient when you don't give me I'll be rebellious we need to break that cycle praise the name of the Lord by allowing Christ to come and live within us that when you are challenged at any time you'll not drop back you'll not backslide you not fall from the truth but then you'll always be encouraged by the truth you'll desire the word of God you desire to be obedient to the word of God not in out I'm in light I'm in darkness but your testimony is constant praise the name of our Lord you know it is constant to continue in the thing that the Lord has told you to do praise the name of the Lord you know the devil like when he tempted the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says he left him for a season after some time then he came back there's a Time Jesus was preaching and when he was preaching then the woman Rose how blessed are the PS that you CED how blessed is the womb she wanted attention Jesus said yes blessed are they that hear the word of God told her here what I'm preaching praise the name of our Lord again he's on another mission and then the Devil Comes they are going to kill you there he keeps on coming the cycle keeps on going but you see even if the Devil Comes you need to be ready to resist him the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee away and he flees and again he comes back you keep on resisting resisting resisting and as long as we are still living in this V they are bodies of Temptation they are bodies of Temptation until these bodies have been changed that's when you say I'm free from tempt I'm free from trials I'm free from persecutions because we live in V bodies Our Lord Jesus Christ right now he lives in a glorified body praise the name of our Lord then there are theophonic bodies the sleeping sins who are living who have gone into those bodies now at the rapture we shall put on the glorified body and the glorified body can never be persecuted praise the name of the Lord because even if you Lo it here it passes through the wall even if you put fire there it can do nothing to it because it can go in the air can walk on the water praise the name of our Lord so as long as we're living in these bod the devil has opportunity to come to us to bring this the natural environment can also affect us as long as we living in this B praise the name of our no wonder what the Bible says that he has filled us with the Holy Spirit until the day of our Redemption that means the bodies are not yet redeemed the bodies that we're living in but the soul has been retained but the bodies are not yet rained so the bodies can be tempted the bodies can be killed the bodies can fall the bodies can be affected praise the name of our Lord so now in the condition that we're living praise the name of our Lord we need to see that we are fully armed praise the name of our Lord we have God living in us to give us the ability to overcome whatever we are going through praise the name of our Lord and don't so much look at the natural what you are going through but see what the Lord can do with you in thetion that you are going through praise the name of our Lord not all the time on this all the time on this where it's the Lord living in all this praise the name of our Lord so the devil keeps on coming keep on coming keep on coming praise the name of our Lord you know in the Millennium when you read in Revelations chapter 20 the Bible says the bride came in the first resurrection and then they were living with Christ but then there were some people who were not saved but they lived in that time in the millennium and the devil was bound a thousand years now you see this when the devil was released at the end of a thousand years what did he do he went and deceived those people who were not redeemed but couldn't deceive the bride he deceived the others and then they came to fight Christ and the bride so we we need the blood of Jesus Christ to overcome the devil praise the name of our Lord that's what we need the life of Jesus Christ will give us the victory to overcome the devil praise the name of our Lord blessed be the name of our Lord amen now let us continue to this script this message in the message questions and answers brother Bram says but now this speak is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and acids and things come right back into the place and develop this picture again now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world it was put in God's Great Fire and then the only thing it did it was futured itself here for you to make your choice then you become a servant of God him for knowing it makes him a makes him a redeemer as we've been through it then the picture is absolutely this is the negative the negative part of life is what where you are living now now let us try to pick it up so brother is saying that in the life we are living is a negative praise the name of our Lord so he says it's a negative it is a shadow in this life there is sorrow in this life there is sickness in in this life there is hunger in this life there is lacking in this life there is being disappointed in this life there is growing old in this life there is becoming week in this life there is being disappointed so he says it is a negative but there is a positive life and that positive life There Is No Death there's no sorrow there's no weakness there's no growing old it's an eternity praise the name of our Lord and then he's saying right now we are living in this you know where you know there is negative at your best time maybe you are 18 years or 16 or 20 years but he says the picture of your best was taken before the foundation of the world but here we are living in the negative then he says if there is a negative there is going to be a positive before a negative if this is a negative there is got to be a positive somewhere and this ain't the real thing this is only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come now you got it so I don't care what they will do with you they can destroy that Prof you know like maybe the animals have eaten or they have bur it say that that's not the main issue then he says they can destroy that profile that picture in God's Great G up [Music] there it cannot destroy it it's in heaven praise the name of our Lord so the real you has been predestinated praise the name of our Lord the real you of you Eternal praise the name of our Lord here we are passing through time to be tempted to be tried a season of Happiness a season of Sorrow a season of of rejoicing a season of morning we are going through that praise the name of our Lord but the reality is God praise the name of our Lord has given us eternal life and that etern life is within us so even if we pass through the seasons of negatives they are not going to consum us praise the name of our they're not going to consume us pass through that but during that season of negative that's when he saw the mighty Revelations of God to say even if the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I'm going to see my redeemer praise the name of our Lord he was so confident that he looked beyond the veil and he saw the promises of God so brother Bram says God has the best of us in his ALB which is eternal praise the name of our who you are praise the name of our Lord and as we are speaking here we have our the bodies in heaven that when you live this Natural Body you go into the body theop praise the name of so we shouldn't allow the seasons of negatives to throw us off to take us back to disappoint us but we need to keep on striving we on moving praise the name of our Lord don't allow the conditions you're going through to take you away from God praise the name of our Lord don't allow if things are failing at a place of work let them not take you away from God if things are not good at home let them not take you away from God if your health is not good let it not take you away from God praise the name of our Lord don't allow anything take you away from Christ because those are temporary things a season praise the name of there just a season ask God to give you the grace to go through the challenges you're going through to go through the disappointment you're going through sometimes you can expect this something else happen What do you do keep on trusting in the praise the name of and don't allow the devil to take a hold of you because you're in the seasons of negatives praise the name of our Lord now let us take a turn praise the name of our Lord the first Dream he dreamed when there was seven healthy cows very well favored time of rejoicing time of celebrating then afterward saw thin ones coming to start eating the seven big ones this is strange they ate but they still remain the same and then same night he dreamed also about weight and it scared him until they called Joseph to interpret the dream so in verse 28 he says this is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh what God is about to do he shows to Pharaoh behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt a season of Great Harvest being happy What the Lord Has Done For Me Oh I'm strong oh I can do this seven plenty years but after the seven plent years seven years of fine so he says and there shall arise them seven years of famine and all the Plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt and the famine shall consume the land praise the name of the Lord he's telling him this is what is going to happen so what do you do be ye ready praise the name of the Lord just as we are in the day now be ready for the night and some people if he knows he doesn't have a torch or if he knows there is a place where people kill he says I better leave early and then he goes back he's preparing for the night praise the name of the Lord he says I'm going to delay says let me call this B man and tell him you know I'm reaching Ginger at midnight and I want you to help me and pick me from he preparing so when there is plenty you need to prepare when there's nothing praise the name of our Lord you need to to prepare and this is one thing each of us should do praise the name of our Lord you need to prepare if you are a young man growing up you need to prepare challenges come you need to prepare for every stage of life because there is a time you PL and there is a time you harvest but there's a time you can't plant and harvest so what do you do you store praise the name of the Lord you store there's a time you can earn and there's a time you can't earn what do you do when you ear what do you do do I go to all the places I know let me buy this expensive shirt been missing I've wear this one of the designers what about in the time of need you're not going to eat that shirt and when you try to sell it noes how much did you buy it I 100,000 but this one has wasted this opportunity God has given him and he has wasted it so Joseph was telling far we need to be careful when we have plenty praise the name of the Lord you know there are some people when they cook food they cook more than what they can eat throws it but now there is a time to become hungry and you can't go back where you thrown it praise the name of the Lord so then Joseph was saying and the plant shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following verse 31 for it shall be Grievous says it will be so terrible and for that the dream was doubled and far T it is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to pass praise the name of the Lord so we also need to be careful with our Liv when you are strong do as much as you can because a time will come when you are weak it will come praise the name of our Lord when you are healthy do the best you can the time of sickness is coming when you are during that time do as much as you can because the night is coming praise the name of the Lord so we just need to be careful now let me go into this message investment he says I do not believe in some of these get rich overnight Investments either by some unidentified business now any good business any good businessman wouldn't take a chance like that maybe on your life s your earnings and you wouldn't invest it in some G night rich and it is unidentified someone run with some kind of an idea here we got a certain F here there's no background to it I think a good sound thinking man would be foolish to try to make investment in such a company as that and we've had many of them around ah you put this you're going to get this put this you're going to get this you put in nothing comes back then he says because I had a friend one time that tried such a and when he did he lost everything he had he lost all his life's ear about ready to retire he thought well I'll take this church because the man seemed to be he knew what he was talking about but come to find out the company was just a make belief company and no stocks on nothing so the poor fellow lost everything he had so I think if a man wants to make a good investment he should first check his company or whatever is making his investment in and find out what is going to do and I think a sensible thinking person would do that praise the name of our Lord you are preparing for the uncertain time and you know you want to generate income praise the name of our Lord you know like you have children and you're not raising your children well you're not investing praise the name of the Lord you're not giving your children you know some kind of training or tutorship you know in the Old Testament they could take the children to tutors to train them to prepare them now we have schools and you don't take them to school ah those ones no what what about the future ahead you know there are some parents who don't want to take their children to school I didn't go to school so they can also not go to school there is danger ahead there is a need ahead how are you going to be helped you know in old age you may not be able to do much right now you can do a lot so when you are old and your house is collapsing the house is like this and then they get you in the house and you didn't invest in your children the child [Music] comes what are going they living in as bad condition as you living because you didn't invest in them so who made the loss so you need to prepare for the time ahead because the challenges come it doesn't matter how you pray and fast now for the night not to come it will become dark at night that's the cycle of Life sometime you are weak sometime you are strong but when you are strong what have you done to help you when you are weak praise the name of the Lord when you have what have you done to help you when you don't have praise the name of the Lord because it a cycle it keeps on coming this one goes another come go another so we need also to learn how to handle Our Lives praise the name of our Lord you need to learn how to handle your life how to handle the challenges of life you know how you know you can see that okay can I be able to have these things done praise the name of the Lord if you're not working why don't you get work and do work and when you get work why don't you do it to the best so that you are the best at the place of when they talk about a person who is Sincere you are there a person who is hard working you are there that's how you maintain your work but now if you get work like in some offices they leave the coats in the chair and goes and does other things you're eating your job so when the time comes to chase you are one of them have don't have hey so we need to see that we prepare for the times that are uncertain praise the name of the Lord prepare for the days ahead every decision you make prepare yourself for certain because uncertainity is coming negative seasons are coming and so God now revealed to pharaoh and showed it to Joseph that there will be a time of Plenty and then there will be a time of and then Joseph told Pharaoh let us get somebody who can help collect all that much and keep it in every city to help in the time of need praise the name of the Lord the time of need will always come but now when that time of need come how do you go through that praise the name of our Lord in the book Hebrews Hebrews 4 verse 16 Hebrews 4: 16 he says let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need amen there is need so you need Grace to help in need praise the name of our Lord and God was warning Egypt this is going to happen so Fara said there's nobody who can handle these issues than Joseph so he put Joseph in the position he put the right man praise the name of our Lord in a position to help handle the challenges when there is need and God has got solution when we're in the time of when we're in the seasons of negatives God has solutions to come and help us in that time of praise the name of our Lord and so when we are challenged out we need to rely on God praise the name of our and as we live we need to ask God for wisdom how we can handle the Affairs of life every day praise the name of our I want us to go to another scripture here and we continue on investment here praise the name of the Lord Psalms Genesis chter 41 and then verse 47 it says and in the seven PL ious years the earth brought forth by handfuls and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid up in the same and Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number for so he says he collected as much as possible when it was available praise the name of the Lord he collected so when you ear you don't waste whatever You' [Music] ear invest put into something praise the name of Lord say that it generates more it gives on bringing more praise the name of our Lord that's how you can be the Bible says and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very s so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the fine and Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan for corn which they bought and Joseph brought the money into far and when the man failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said give us bread why should we die in thy presence for the money fath he said they had money but the money failed it lost value like in Zimbabwe some years ago you needed something like 8 million you put the money on the wheelbarrow to buy a Loof of bread money fail so money can fail any time so having or keeping money is just not the best investment you put it to make work you know you put it to make more money you know in that same message we reading brother Bram was saying it's not a good idea to keep your money in your pocket many people say I would just put it in my pocket but you know you business men and women you don't think in those terms it's not good thing because it can be stolen the best is to it is best to have it in circulation like the Lord said one time he gave so many talents to so many and such and then they made an investment with it and those who made a sound a good Sound Investment he gave them [Music] dividends but when the one man said I just kept it didn't want to take any chances on it put it in my pocket I buried it somewhere he taken that he had given to him and gave it another that had drawn more dividends that to put it in a good investment and that's the way our Lord doing things praise the name of our Lord you earning invest praise the name of our Lord not just keeping I have accumulated this amount of money and the more it is kept the more it loses value what can buy maybe a plot of land at the beginning of the year at the end of the year it can't buy that land so when the money failed Joseph told them bring your CLE so CLE has more value than money hey now it is investment praise the name of the Lord so you just keep there your money the one putting it in animals is better than because they multiply praise the name of our Lord that's what he was telling Joseph was telling them and now when the animals were over let us go back to verse chapter 47 verse 15 and when the man failed in the land okay verse 16 and Joseph said give me your CLE and I'll give you your CLE if money fail so all the CLE was taken and when the year was ended again they said we cannot die we don't have anything but our land land has more value than animals and more than money where are you investing and now when the land is taken you become a slave you sell yourself so we need to see where we invest to help us in the time of need you don't eat all your salary praise the name of our Lord just eat everything when the job is what are you going to do what will happen if you want to eat go to either those high places KFC chicken tonight tonight when you can use the same money to buy a whole thing wastefulness of course if you can afford there's no problem with that but if you are going to be in Deb all the time and then you doing such a thing that is Reck L Living Praise the name of that's reckless living so you need to learn how to invest what God has given to when God gave the other two talents he traded and got more two talents when he gave five talents he traed and that's what this natural life is even the spiritual also is that you don't remain alone but you need to bring more children to the kingdom the than when he was given one Talent he buried it are we using the gifts God has given unto us are we using the talents God has given unto us God has given you this gift God has given you the other Talent doing the best to improve your welfare are you using it to improve your family are you using it to improve your livelihood are you using it to build the kingdom of God praise the name of Lord this is why God has given us this praise the name of our Lord is that you can participate into the things of God praise the name of our Lord so it is good to invest right because it has benefits praise the name of our Lord now let us go and read in the Book of Psalms 15 Psalms 15 and then verse one he says a sum of David Lord who shall abide in thy Tabernacle who shall dwell in thy Holy Hill he that walth uprightly and WTH right and speaketh the truth in his heart he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor do evil to his neighbor nor take up a reproach against his neighbor in whose eyes a vile person is condemned but he honor them that fear the lord he swears to his own heart and changes not he that putteth not out his money to user nor take up regard against the innocent he that does these things shall never be moved praise the name of the Lord so he says who shall dwell in the Tabernacle of God who shall dwell in His Holy Hill and then he gives the answer that we need to walk uprightly Walking In righteousness speaking the truth in his heart so when you are in the season of negatives you are in the times of challenge you need to uphold your integrity you know like job when he was challenged he held his Integrity he never cast God he never complained and said this and this but was thankful to the Lord and then he worshiped God so when we go through challenging times we need to keep our uprightness we need to work righteousness praise the name of our and see that the Lord takes charge over your lives and you know you are not imagining things which are wrong or things that are evil but you see you are depending upon God to give you Grace to overcome the challenges that you facing praise the name of our Lord you need to stay strong by the word of God regardless of the Season be relable praise the name praise the name of our good season praising God you know devil is smart when the Bible talks about the Thorns even when the seasons are good they are thorns the pleasures of life because you have money say church is wasting my time I need to do this and this even when it is Bad season cares of Life the devil keeps on coming I don't have money he comes I have money he comes I'm healthy he comes I'm sick he comes when people are strong that's when they want do all evil things and now when people are weak and sickly the Devil Comes them that you Cur evil or kill because you're going to die any time the devil keeps on coming but in whatever sitation we are going through we need to be walking upright we need to have the word of God inside of us that we can be able to stand by that word and be able to overcome praise the name of our Lord now let me finish with this message Jehovah he says then when Abraham was 90 and n years God appeared to him in the 17th chapter of Genesis and he appear to him in the name of el sh El sh is Hebrew word which means the blessed one the Blessed god notice Abraham was almost 100 and God appeared to him in the the name of the blessed one like the mother with her baby just a breast just a breast God but blessed God now what is it then he says he died for a compound cause for both soul and body he was wounded for our transgression withes were him is the Blessed lifegiver the little baby when is sick needy the mother takes it to her bosom then feeds it and it strengthens the mother's body and it's the strength of the mother 's body goes into the baby and the little baby is satisfied with the recover while covering child the children of Abraham lays onto the bosom of God and his Divine promises and is satisfied while they are recovering because they announcing from the promise of the almighty God you are if you are weak spiritually lean over his bosom little sick child Abraham said well I'm 100 years God said you are just a little boy baby I am thy strength giver and now just come up here on my bosom and you are as good as dead and the womb of Sarah is good as dead because the husband and wife is one just lay here on my promise that you've been ncing on and I'll n you back to health praise the name of the Lord so in the times where we are distressed we need to help us in the time of need to help us in the sttion of unities help us in the seasons of the negatives you know when there is sorrow praise the name of our then you know if this person has died in Christ I'm going to meet that person again praise the name of our Lord something comes and then gives gives you consolation gives you comfort when in darkness Comfort comes the light comes praise the name of our Lord so in whatever thing we go through in life praise the name of our Lord the Bible has told us is a very present help in travel in everything you go through just rely on the Lord just depend upon God and then you see the goodness of God how the Lord will take you out of that sttion praise the name of our Lord in M 7 verse 7 Mah 7 ver7 he says therefore I will look unto the Lord I'll wait for the god of my salvation my God will hear me Rejoice not against me or my enemy when I fall I shall arise when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be light unto me our that's the confession we need to have that when I'm in the negatives and Venture I fall when I'm in the season of negative just believe I'm going to arise praise the name of our Lord the Bible says righteous person falls seven times but when he falls he doesn't remain down he arises because he sees where he's going he says when I'm in darkness the Lord shall be light unto me praise the name of our Lord so when we in the seasons of negatives it it doesn't matter thetion you're going through just look unto the Lord to give you the victory overcome that station even when you faint in that
