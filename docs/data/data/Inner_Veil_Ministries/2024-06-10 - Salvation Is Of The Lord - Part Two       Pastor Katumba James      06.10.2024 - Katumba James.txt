will be be done for the glory and honor of your name in the name of the Lord Jesus amen I GRE again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I request we go back to the scripture we read in the morning Jonah chapter 2 praise the name of our Lord Jonah 2 shall read verse praise the name of the Lord the Bible says I will sacrifice unto thee with voice of Thanksgiving I will repay that I have vought salvation is of the Lord seated I just want to continue with what we started in the morning praise the name of a lord I took almost a different direction in the morning praise the name of our Lord just something to build our Fai praise the name of our Lord just sng that song that he is Lord praise the name of our Lord now if he is Lord then what is difficult for him to do praise the name of our Lord we just need to see that we have confidence in the Lord praise the name of our Lord and then believe him now salvation is of the Lord praise the name of our Lord and many times when we talk about salvation we sometimes limit it know and then we put it at that time and then we don't bring it in our daily circumstances praise the name of our Lord maybe you are stuck in this kind of Str you have this kind of need you are traveled in this kind of things and we rarely bring those scriptures we don't always bring those scriptures to pass every day in daily living praise the name of our Lord we really do that we really do that but okay now I want us to move now you see here the Bible says that salvation is of the Lord it is only Christ that works it out now in the message the phian church age brother Bram says now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it is Christ or perish and it is not even Christ and works it is Christ Alone this age began the years of arminianism that does not believe in Christ as the reality it does not sing of nothing but the blood but it SS of nothing but the blood and my own conduct now I believe in Good Conduct and if you are saved you will do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus it is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from start to finish all God let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that FS me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that H me be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteous that I have done no sir Christ is my life amen so it is the Lord himself who starts out our Salvation from the very beginning to the end praise the name of our and just to bring it in the simplest it can be it is the who led you the first time when you interacted with the minister it's the Lord maybe you were on other things and then someh the Lord you in a certain place maybe it was a crusade or radio program or some book and then you unless you get saved then you start thinking this it was the Lord who led you to that point and it is the same Lord who appointed that minister to preach to you praise the name of our Lord now we just want to look at some scripture here you know Cornelius was praying until the angel came down and then when the angel came down the angel told Cornelius go call for Peter and now Peter where he was was also praying and fasting and then the Lord showed him you know different animals to be eaten and the voice was telling him slay and eat said I don't eat those the second time it came the third time went away and then Peter was wondering what is this and then at that same time people who were sent by Cornelius had reached where Peter reses praise the name of our Lord go to acts chap 10 and then we read in verse 17 now while Peter doubted in himself what this Vision which he had seen should mean behold men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry of Simon's house and stood before the gate and called and asked whether Simon Peter which was son named Peter was lodged there sought on this Vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek arise therefore and get thee down go with them doubting nothing for I have now you see the spirit was telling Peter the Holy Spirit was telling Peter I'm the one who has sent these people go don't doubt anything and now when Peter reached the house of Cornelius he started wondering why did you call for me Cornelius told him the vision Peter started preaching to them the Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord now in Acts chapter8 praise the name of the Lord and then vers 26 and the angel of the Lord spoke unto Philip saying arise go toward the South unto the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaz which is Desert and he AR and went and behold a man of Ethiopia an unar of great Authority Under The Queen Under cand queen of ethopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship and was returning and sitting in his Chariot read the prophet then the spirit said unto Philip go near and join thyself to The Chariot so you see it is always the Holy Spirit appointing the minister and it's the Holy Ghost using the minister to preach the word praise the name of our Lord so it is the spirit that ministers to you it's the spirit that preaches to you the word of God so now the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord like if we can now demonstrate it you are not at you are not at this wall and then the Holy Ghost is other world praise the name of our Lord that's not what it is but the Holy Ghost comes to where you are praise the name of our Lord and then starts taking you through all the way up to where he wants you to be praise the name of the Lord so the Holy Ghost ministers to you the word of God to bring you under conviction it is the holy spirit that convicts us let us go to John chapter 16 praise the name of the Lord John chapter 16 and verse 7 nevertheless I tell you truth it's expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment praise the name of our Lord so it's the Holy Ghost who brings conviction so when you are convicted in your heart it the holy spirit so then you can't say the Holy Ghost is far away from me it's the holy ghost that preaches to the word and when you hear the word it's the holy ghost that convicts you and now when you get convicted and you repent of your sins and you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ it is the holy spirit that justifies you praise the name of our Lord so you see that it is this work of the lord it's the Lord who justifies you it's the Lord who sanctifies you it's the Lord who fills you with the holy spirit it's the Lord who raises you up it's the Lord who makes you grow up and it's the Lord who positionally places you that's the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit preaches to you the Holy Spirit convicts you the Holy Spirit forgives your sins the holy spirit separates you from your evil nature sanctification then the same Holy Spirit after he has cleaned you himself he fills you himself so how is the holy spirit from you so the only thing that you need in this work is to be obedient to be willing and obedient that's how your full salvation can be worked you allow the Lord to take over your life and then he works in your life to bring you to his image to bring you to his St that's what salvation is all about is allow him to take over your life praise the name of our Lord let us go to E chapter 36 and then we read from verse 24 the Bible says for I will take you from among the heaven and gather you out of all countries and I'll bring you into your own it is God who is saying I will take you from the heaven from unbelief and then take you to the place I want you to be in how does he do that then says then I will sprinkle clean water upon you verse 25 and you shall be clean from all all your filth and from all your Idols will I cleanse you praise the name of the Lord It's God himself saying I will I I will not yourself not your so much kind of works you want to do but it's God saying I'm going going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this so what we do is I come and present myself to the Lord and say Lord thy own way in my life praise the name of our Lord just learning how to surrender to God and then he will bring the work of Salvation to completion praise the name of the Lord you know some people think that When God says you are saved then he allows he leaves you to battle it yourself let me see how he does it no it's all of God and it's all of Grace praise the name of our Lord now that God has been kind to you he has opened your eyes and you knew that you were born in sin sh in iniquity he has called you then allow him to continue doing that work in your life says I will take you from the Heen when I take you from the Heen I will bring you to your land when I bring you to your land I will sprinkle you with clean water the washing water of the world I will take away your FS I will take away your Idols I will make you clean it's all of God praise the name of our Lord you only need to surrender and allow God to work it out praise the name of the Lord then in verse 26 and a new heart also will I give you maybe you you follow as I as I read and a new heart also will I give you verse 26 you translate and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stone heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh it's the Lord saying I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this he says he will take our Stone heart and then he will give us a heart of Flesh a new heart and after giving us a new heart he gives us a new spirit and he puts that new spirit in the new heart and after he has put a new heart there he puts a new spirit there after putting the new spirit there he puts a new okay after putting the new heart there he puts a new spirit now when he has put there a new spirit it says in verse 26 and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statute and shall keep my judgments and do them he it's God himself he gives you a new heart he removes the Stony heart then he puts the new spirit in your new heart and after he has given you a new heart he fills you with his own holy spirit so where are you Lord I'm here walk upon me the way it pleases you praise the name of the Lord so you can't say now I've taken 10 years without the Holy Spirit you don't know what you're looking for praise the name of our Lord you can't have look for the Holy Ghost the whole year you don't know what you're looking for praise the name of our Lord you don't know maybe you're looking for something different but is God himself saying I will do this I will do this I will do this I will do this you can imagine conar praise the name of our Lord the man was doing well praying giving for support praise the name of our Lord and then the angel came down and says your prayers have been heard then he says now what you need to do if you are going to do if you going to do better send for Peter and now when Peter is told please come he realized it's the Holy Ghost sending him but the Holy Ghost doesn't tell him everything but maybe along the road he hear the story of those men was moving and then he reaches cornelius's house why did you call for said you know I had this and this said okay I know God is a respect of no person but every person in every country where is respected know he does this he was talking then talked about Jesus how he died how he resurrected how we took our sins and then the Bible says while Peter yet spoke this and now you can imagine it was corus who was praying and fasting but when he heard that Peter is coming he called his neighbors and friends and fames come and we hear this is something God wants us to hear and now those people were all there praise the name of our Lord and then when they heard the word believed the word the Holy Ghost came and then you say and you say I've taken 10 years without the Holy Ghost praise the name of the lord it's not right there's something different you're looking for the Holy Spirit works out our Salvation from the very beginning to the very end that's what the Holy Ghost is praise the name of the Lord but we go and limit the Holy Spirit to what we want to see what we want to feel but it's the Holy Spirit brings conviction in your heart and it's the Holy Spirit when you are convicted and Lord forgive me you repent of your sins you go to the water baptism it's the holy spirit that justifies you praise the name of the Lord It's the holy spirit that sanctifies you it's the Holy Ghost himself that comes and BRS ins and here we are seeing what God is saying I will take you from the country of the heaven so you didn't say let me leave these sins and go and it was the work of God praise the name of our Lord that took you from there and put you somewhere else for his purpose praise the name of our Lord and then God changes your heart praise the name of the Lord I just want to read the quot here in the message what it it takes to make a Christian he says now I want you to listen for a few moments before closing I want you to notice one thing and watch closely now watch the order of the scripture I will take away the ston heart and give you a new heart now the heart is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit and I will give you a new spirit I want you to watch the order now many people get mixed up there they think they got the Holy Ghost but they just get a new spirit watch I'll will give you a new heart and a new spirit and then I will put my spirit it says God had to give you a new spirit but that's a new spirit God give you so you could get along with the Holy Ghost with that old Spirit you had you couldn't get along with your neighbor you couldn't get along with yourself so you know you couldn't get along with God so God gives you a new spirit that's what he does so he gives you a new heart that you can be patient and you hear the word praise the name of the Lord and sometimes things being spoken are not pleasant to you but you are you are the the new heart becomes patient he puts the new spirit you know to get alone to get along with your neighbor to get along with the word to get along with God you're not going to quarrel with God you're not going you know to just say I don't like this so he gives you that spirit and then you can sit calm and all this one here is for you to allow the Holy Spirit he gives you that new heart and the new spirit that the Holy Ghost can work upon your life praise the name of our Lord and as the Holy Ghost Works upon your life then the Holy Spirit himself comes and fills your heart praise the name of our Lord so you see that it's you to yield to God and many times under enthusiasm if you watch the life that it bears I hope I'm not hurting but I hope I'm uncovering see a lot of times you think that you would have the Holy Spirit oh you say I sng I spoke in Tong certainly being that close to it you might do all that but that isn't the holy spirit yet see the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ now he taken what did he do he give you in your heart he give you in your spirit then he puts his Spirit his spirit in you you don't have to go around and pretend that you are a Christian man that new spirit brings the new life the holy spirit in your new spirit your new heart your new spirit and the Holy Spirit goes right in the center of your new spirit and your new spirit goes right in the center of your new heart but all these things they done by the Lord is the Lord working out your salvation prise the name of our Lord the Lord so now he has pied to you like brother Bram demonstrates that you go to the rubbish pit and then you pick a cup when you pick a cup that is justification but you can't use that cup in that condition because still dirty but you've already picked it that's how that's what happens to us when you accept Jesus as your personal savior he forgives all your past sins but in you there is still a nature to desire to do evil and now this is where sanctification starts from destroy that can nature that nature that desires to do evil praise the name of our Lord so he sanctifies you you know that's the time you having The Stone Heart has been taken away youve got a fleshy heart you've got a new heart you've got a new spirit praise the name of our Lord he's working upon you so now when he washes you then he uses you that is fing you that's God himself salvation is of the Lord praise the name of our Lord and then now in another message praise the name of our Lord he says the hidden life with Christ that's what the church needs today a hidden consecrated life you can't be D doubling along with the world and impersonating and acting like them and hide with Christ because you are trying to Fashion After the world trying to live like the next Church you are trying to belong to a better organization we better clothes do so and so that's not complying with Christianity Christianity is a sacrificed life hidden with God through Christ sealed by by the Holy Ghost that's what real Christian Life consists of not of how well you can do this or how well you can see that's all right how well you can preach that is fine but that is not it it is the hidden life consecrated the veil it C dropped around you and you are dead and buried and you are HID in God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost praise the name of our Lord that's what it is a consecrated life a hidden life praise the name of the Lord you know because it's God by putting a new heart in you he will create a s a yearning for more of himself that you desire more of God to come in your life so this one drives you into [Music] consecration a consecrated life reading the word of God speaking about the word of God hearing the word of God jying about the word of and you know as you dedicate yourself then the word trans transforms you the word changes you praise the name of our Lord it changes your thinking if you have evil thoughts they find no room in you praise the name of our Lord and then you find that you have words of encouragement and as your thoughts have been changed then your words are change and as your words are change even actions are CH praise the name of our Lord because your heart is subject you know it is submissive you know to the one that you dedicate yourself to you hear the word you think about the word you speak the word and then you perform it so the life itself is is being formed in you you see that Life of Christ is a reality in your life praise the name of that's the life of Jesus Christ that shows you have been redeemed redeemed from the way the other people do like people at places of work somebody starts in the morning thinking about the drinking place so so in the day he's looking for opportunities of getting money praise the name like if you go to some offices they say you can disturb you what are you saying you brought your file here let me check maybe you didn't bring it I don't know who took it away tell me what is your name maybe he checks then he sees it then maybe he calls the office messenger now this gentleman brought his F the other day but he needs it and his work is urgent so you need to find time and you they know how to talk there's too much work live late okay we see what to do now when he's there you know you want something so what you do you just leave here this and then he will do it once he gets work it for you you think how much how much do you have okay do this then you put there that's what they do now when he gets that he knows he can go to the B the evening so the day is done even if he lives office at 10:00 in the morning already but now for you it's different you'll be sincere in what you're doing praise the name of our Lord somebody will not come and then you start you know like you know kind of like dodging him he will come what do you want what's your name Che okay sorry I'm sorry this thing has been here for long you work on it give it to him no excuse but then the other this this this he speaks this he thinks this he does this he say something you know they're under bondage they're not safe praise the name of our Lord they in a cage but if you being delivered from that if you have been delivered it's a life that you live unconsciously because is part of you you speak what is in your heart you tell somebody okay this is this what you do today you can even do the same tomorrow without any much effort part of you praise the name of our Lord so we need to consecrate Our Lives to allow the Holy Spirit to work upon us to mold us to bring him to bring us in His image praise the name of our Lord now in the message what does it take to make a Christian Life he says and when you have this little temper fs and you fly you and you fly out and you tell lies and you Pro and you jump defences and so and you are so selfish with your organization that you are so narrow minded you could not hear another Minister just remember the Holy Spirit isn't ticking in the middle of inside of you praise the name of our Lord you know there are some people who can tell they have the Holy Spirit but ler they don't have the H they despise others and then you say what holy spirit is this one why is that life praise the name of our Lord where is the life of Jesus Christ then he says the H spirit will make every movement like Christ it will make you Christ like the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering goodness weekness gentleness patience faith those things are what the Holy Spirit controls or emotions our emotions is not so much as jumping up and down you could do that then he says aing will bring that to you but the Holy Spirit brings you into operation or in the control of God that you walk in peace and in love and in Joy with long suffering goodness weekness gentleness patience see it isn't something that you do it is something the Holy Spirit does in you you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it is a subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so the life is yielded the same holy spirit that convicted you has been gaining ground you know gaining ground of your whole being he gained ground of your heart he gained ground of your human spirit and now he has filled you until all your reasoning the the senses of the human Spirit they are all ticking with the word of you affections your Delight praise the name of our you know brother Bram had a person I think she was a girlfriend before he married and then she would say you don't go for party you don't like smoking you don't like like drinking what do you like then he told him what I like is the word of God that's my passion praise the name of Lord because there is a change within my life About Us Praise the name of the Lord if they bring I don't know what these days they watch maybe some movie some opera or or soap whatever they call them then you were there the whole night a football match no sleep but you put a preacher hey where do you fall when it is the ears are like this you don't want to miss any single is the word your mind is on something else so is the holy spirit then but if the holy spirit is right inside of us he will drive us to the things of God he will make you desire the things of God like David he said I was happy I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house it was his delight and then he said I would rather be a D in the house of God in a par but he was a king and he said I want to be like a D in something special that draws you to that there's something that links up there's something that connects deep calling to the Deep praise the name of our Lord and brother Bram says when the Deep calls the Deep praise the name of our Lord you know when you get a thirst it means that there is a feeling praise the name of Lord and we need to have that continuous thir in us more of God being like Jesus Christ that should always keep us moving praise the name of our Lord every day you Delight to hear what Lord I want to hear what you telling Lord I want to see your meres this Lord I want to see your goodness this Lord I want to see you manifested in my life that's how we need to live praise the name of our lord said that the Holy Spirit has got Liberty in working on all our lives praise the name of Lord and don't hide anything to God you know you're just surrendering yourself to God and then you see how the Lord will work out one by one one by one so you're not afraid of anything you know God has taken charge over your life praise the name of our Lord not scared about anything because he's there he's settled he's Ling praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the children of God and that's how we need to seek every day Lord lead me Lord here yours I need your guidance I need your direction praise the name of and then you'll see that Christianity will become such a great joy not a burden praise the name of our Lord because he says my yoke is easy praise the name of our Lord my yoke is easy and my burden is light it's not problematic praise the name of the Lord you didn't make a contract to be a Christian five years it's over no it's an eternity it's a life praise the name of our when those are enjoying their beers and so on for you enjoy your Christian Life they have beer they have beer get hangovers they in debts they Tred but when they come to you you are as good as you were before praise the name of our Lord and then they start wondering you have more problems but you are more happy there is something special about your life praise the name of our Lord that's the True Life of Christ praise the name of our Lord not a pretense oh I I had this I felt like this do you live in your life praise the name of the Lord now in the M of hidden life in Christ he says what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters into with Christ the things of the world with God and veils dropped round down round and the world is shut off then Christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer today people just have enough religion to make them miserable knowing that they ought to do this they are trying to escape hell well if that's the way I felt about it if that's the way I felt about it brother I don't know what I would do but many people are caught up in that you know I have to struggle I have to struggle this I have to like phares you know what they were confessing I fast two times a week that's why they D their righteousness from I give what I have you know they they are glorifying what they are able to do not What the Lord Has Done in their Liv but our Salvation is of the Lord what the Lord is doing in my life praise the name of our Lord that should be our Delight that should be our joy you know I Surrender myself to the Lord and Lord take over all my life Lead Me Lord guide me Lord you know you'll find that even at your home praise the name of our Lord you know whatever challenges are there the Lord Remains the Lord is the Lord of your heart it's the Lord of everything so you commit whatever you're going through to him and you move forward and then you move forward praise the name you know it says it becomes a pleasure every day it is Pleasant to live for Christ praise the name of our Lord then he says who get in with Christ shut off from the things of the world commune with him as a pleasure it is beautiful it is something that fs and satisfies the soul something that gives you peace that passes all understanding all the crosses become a flying wings and all the burdens are chariot wheels oh you can't fly away burdens are light yoke up with him the yoke is all paddled with Hallelujah when you are once inside the ve with him he becomes your life praise the name of our Lord so you're no longer living it's God living in you and then he says people are trying to live on Mount siai I will do this I will do this that's M they have their own [Music] laws M but you need to leave Mount and come to Calvary where everything is paid praise the name of our Lord you live m where it is AOW to you to put on Long clothes until now when you're coming to church you start looking around the clothes I think this one nobody say that I put on tight how about you're just thinking of what people will say it's a law not life so when you going to the place of work you know I'm not meeting any believer put on short ones when you come to church I put on long ones that's slow you are living on but when you go to calary you test your test you know you you'll not mix bad and good praise the name of Lord you not buy short and long you not buy wide and tight that's a law to you that becomes a law but when you are transformed you'll only pick the right thing praise the name of the Lord why because you are changed there is a life it's a pleasure praise the name of our Lord while the others are posing you know there are stles people now either they stand in particular you tight it is or they do [Music] something tight to show something and put on and then they stretch it like this there's something they showing but you know you are not interested in those things it's not your test you are not on you on calary Jesus Paid It all praise the name of the Lord you're not in those kind of things praise the name of our Lord so for you you are delivered you have a consecrated life praise the name of our Lord then he says if I'll go to church now he's talking about Sin if I go to church if I pay my dues if I do this do that if I quit this and stop that that is still on Mount it's you not Christ but allow the Holy Spirit who said I will put a new heart in you I will put a new spirit in you I will put my spirit in you and bu in your heart so it's a life praise the name of our Lord if they take you from and then they put you in Moro even the people in Moro will have the same testimony the people in ging that that one is a fear goodar not the people who know [Music] Ginger I see going to that church on long maybe but when you go too is party person different testimonies so when you're in G you are living by the law now where there is no law there I'm free but when you are changed you in they know you you go to where they don't know you your testimony is the same praise the name of our Lord so he says when you come to a place where you are dead and your life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost the whole Christian life becomes a great glorious shout and Hallelujah to you and you are he away daily that's what we need praise the name of our Lord salvation is of the Lord you just yield to the Lord and then he will bring you into that St praise the name of our Lord he will bring you into the image his own image you are not so suspicious all the time Tred all the time but your heart is settled on God praise the name of our Lord we need to have that kind of consecration praise the name of our Lord just depending upon God looking unto him depending upon Him Praise the name of our Lord for it is God who works within us praise the name of our Lord is the one that brings our life to transformation he's the one that brings our life to his St we only need to allow him to work it out in our lives praise the name of our Lord like the children of Israel they were in bondage 400 years but it is God himself who came down praise the name of our Lord let us go in the book of Exodus chter 3 and verse 6 Exodus 3:6 moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord say I have sure seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard the Cry of by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am C down to to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land up the land of a good land a large and a land flowing with milk and honey and the place of the canites and the Hees and the amorites and the parites and the hites and jit now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel come unto me and I've also seen the oppression with the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send you unto Pharaoh that th may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt it's God who came down says I have come down to deliver them praise the name of our so it's God working out in our Salvation they were in bondage in Egypt then God said I've come down and then God identified Moses and said I'm sending you to bring these people praise the name of our so it was the grace of God that provided a deliverer it's Grace praise the name of our Lord salvation is of the Lord praise the name of our Lord you have to recognize it and accept it praise the name of our Lord now in the message atesh he says yes they had not lost their convence they had lost their freedom they were slaves but the Covenant still lasting and one day down there when they were groaning and crying under the task masters of the Egypt because they had become slaves I want you to notice this beautiful picture and this would be good for the legalists listen God never come down and say if you'll do certain things I'll do certain things God is Grace provided a savior Moses that's right not under any conditions was Moses brought but by The Sovereign Grace of God sent Moses not only a savior but Grace provided a deliverer without any law without anything just solemn grace of God he sent down Moses to be a deliverer and the savior of the nation to bring them out praise the name of our Lord and then he said when when I think of that then I begin to remember that the same God that was with the Covenant people in is surely under all the strain he says under all the strength and difference that is in the church [Music] tonight he will by the grace of his own being send a deliverer we are just as certain to get an outpouring of the holy spirit in these last days as they were sitting in the church tonight God has acted to the Covenant people without the efforts of theirs but he sent freely from Heaven to his Covenant people an act of Grace upon the servant of his promise he sent Moses and in the same crisis when the people is in bondage under everything the Yoke of sin and sickness and trouble today is just certain to send Jesus Christ the second time as he sent Moses in the first time praise the name of our Lord so it's the Lord who works it out they were in bondage in Egypt God sent Moses a deliverer a savior praise the name of our Lord just the same thing with us he said I will I will I will salvation is of the Lord praise the name of our so when you get held up ination remember the Lord wants to deliver you praise the name of the Lord the Lord wants to set you free from whatever condition you are in from whatever circumstance you are in so what you need to do is to call upon the name of the Lord say Lord I'm here Lord I need your deliverance praise the name of our Lord and then you allow the Lord to take over your life praise the name of the Lord now just as I finish let us go to the book of Isaiah 1 Isaiah 1 verse 16 the scripture says wash you and make you
