May you speak to us according to your vual and purpose and even according to our needs in the name of the Lord Jesus pray and ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us go to Hebrews chapter 3. We're reading from verse 7 to verse 14. &gt;&gt; Yes. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost says today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness. When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works 40 years, Wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said, "They do always error in their heart, and they have not known my ways. So I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest. Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. But exalt one daily while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end. may God bless his word. You may be seated. So I want to pick our subject from verse 10 which says and they have not known my ways. So I want to talk on the subject. This is my way. Praise the name of the Lord. So here he was talking about the children of Israel. How God led them from the land of Egypt. And you know by the time God was speaking them from the land of Egypt, he showed a lot of works. a lot of signs and wonders. And then he brought them to the sacrifice of the Passover. And then the death angel did not go into their homes because they had applied the blood of the lamb. But then to the n to the Egyptians, there was always death for the firstborn child and the firstborn animals. They were all dying that night. So then the children of Israel went and when they reached the Red Sea, they walked in a dry land and when they were even moving, you know, the Bible says the pillar of fire was there leading them during the night. Then during the daytime it was a cloud. And you know that cloud was covering them to shield them from the sun. Then at night there was a pillar of fire which would give them the light. And if there was coldness then it would also kind of emit heat you know to give them a comfortable condition. And now when they cross the Red Sea they were all rejoicing. And then the Bible says that Miriam and all the women were singing rejoicing a song of victory. Praise the name of our Lord. They had overcome Egypt. They had overcome unbelief in the world. Praise the name of our Lord. Now that is in numbers chapter 15. Praise the name of our Lord. Numbers chapter 15 and then verse 20. Let us start from verse 18. &gt;&gt; He says, "The Lord shall reign forever and ever." Brother Exodus 15 verse 18. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with the chariots and with the horsemen into the sea. And the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them. But the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timber in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbros and with dances. And Miriam answered them, "Sing ye to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea. Praise the name of our Lord. You know they were singing that song of victory like in the morning we sang happy day when Jesus delivered me from my sin. You know like the joy that you get that you have been saved. God has received you into his kingdom. So they were singing and rejoicing. Praise the name of our Lord. And then you can imagine all the waters on the sides and then Pharaoh's army drowned in the waters. And then now as they went after that song of Jubilee, I'm saved. I'm set free. Praise the name of our Lord. You know they were rejoicing over overcoming Egypt. And then they thought that the journey is now going to be that easy all the way. Ah everything is going to be okay. But they didn't know that the way of God he wanted them sanctified. Praise the name of our Lord. So when they come out of the Red Sea, the Bible says three days into the wilderness, they found no water. And then they they came and they could not drink of the waters of Mara because the waters were bitter. And then the people started murmuring. In Exodus 15 verse 24, and the people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink? And there was bitter water. And then God healed the water. And then now as they kept on going, there was no food. There's no shop to buy food. There is no garden to buy food. There is no world food program to throw down food. God was trying them, taking them through different situations. And then the Bible says in Exodus chapter 16, and then the scripture says in verse one, and they took their journey from Elm, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came out to the wilderness of sin, which is between Elim and Sinai. On the 15th day of the second month, after they departing out of the land of Egypt, And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. And the children of Israel said unto them, would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to fool. For you have brought us forth in the wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger. [Music] You know like they say they came out of Egypt but Egypt never came out of there. So they were referring to the flesh ports in Egypt. Oh, we had cemeteries to bur our dead. We had garlic. We had onions. We had this. We had towns. Now you brought us in the wilderness. And sometimes we can also be confused that when we come to Christ, everything should be as not in Christ. It shouldn't be like that. This is a different way. Praise the name of our Lord. And we need to learn the way of the Lord. The children of Israel had not known the way of the Lord. Anything they were lacking, they were complaining. everything they never had. They're just complaining, complaining. You know the way people cry to politicians even when their well water well is is is They want the politician to go and dig for them everything crying to politicians. So they were crying to God in every aspect. When the water was bitter or water is too bitter when they have no food, there's no food. Then God would drain the mana. Now you see that the children of Israel, every other time, they had something to complain about. When you go to chapter 17, they reached a certain place and there was no water. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And the people cried." Verse one, &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 17. And then verse one, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according the commandment of the Lord and pitched in Rafidim, and there was no water for the people to drink. Wherefore the people did child with Moses and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, why ch with me? Wherefore do you tempt the Lord? And the people thirsted there for water. And the people murmured against Moses and saying, "Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? you know, saying, "Why are you making us to suffer?" But they never knew the way of the Lord. So Moses cried to the Lord, said, "Lord, what shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me. And then the people were saying, "Is the Lord amongst us? All these things we are going through but the pillow of fire was there, the cloud was there, the prophet is there. The other day mana is even coming down every day. And then they are saying is God amongst us in verse seven. And he called the name of the place Masa and Marba because of the chiding of the children of Israel and because they tempted the Lord saying, "Is the Lord among amongst us or not? Praise the name of Lord. They never knew the way of the Lord. Let us go also to numbers chapter 20. And we read also following the same things. And then verse two, &gt;&gt; and there was no water for the congregation, and they gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron. And the people chedd with Moses, saying, "Would God that we have died when our brethren died before the Lord? And wherefore why have you brought up up the congregation of the Lord into the wilderness that we and our should die here? out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place is not place of seed, nor figs or vines or pomegranates. Neither is there any water to drink. for so they never knew the way of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. And sometimes you may also not know the way of the Lord. But the way of the Lord was to take them throughation. He takes you a situation where there is no food to learn to depend upon him. Praise the name of our Lord. He takes you through a station where there is no water for you to learn that God who created water can even create water in the earth. Like there is a time Samson had victory. He used a job born to kill thousands of Philistines. The spirit of God came upon him and killed thousands. But now after he had killed those people, he became so thirsty. Now Samson said, "Oh Lord, you have given me victory to be defeat these enemies, but you see thirst is killing me." And then the Lord heard Samson his voice and out of the hole in the jaw there was water which started coming out. Praise the name of our Lord. The same thing with Hagi. When Hagai was with Ishmael in the wilderness and then the sun was thirsting for water cry to the Lord and then the Lord made sure that the water starts flowing. So now the children of Israel never learned how to depend upon God in every stress that they were going through and God allowations to come in our way that we can learn to depend upon him. When there was no food, he proved that he can feed them a way. Now when they ate mana after many days and we are tired we've taken long without eating flesh. &gt;&gt; Then Moses told God then God told Moses I'm going to rain it. I'm going to bring then Moses said are you going to blow the whole river to bring the fish here all these people are you going to feed them? Then God said you will see it. So every day there were birds flying and they were flying at a level of about three chits. You know where you would catch them every day. Everybody would pick whatever they would pick. God providing whatever they need. But they reach a station then they complain. when they are sick, brother Brandham teaches us they had Dr. Moses and Moses would only read one scripture. The Lord forgiveth all your sins and health all your diseases. He never had a hospital, but God was healing them. When the serpents came to to kill them, he told them, "Put the present serpent in whatever condition they were in." The Lord was always there to provide for their needs. And it's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So even as in whatever condition we go through, the Lord is always there to meet all that we have need. Praise the name of our Lord. He said, "I'm the very present helper in the time of trouble." But the children of Israel never learned how to trust in God, how to depend upon God, how to call upon the name of the Lord, but instead was complaining, mammar, why don't we go back to Egypt. When I was a castle, oh, I didn't suffer like this. When I was a protester, I didn't suffer like this. When I was in my village there, I could not sleep hungry. Now, that was in Egypt. Praise the name of our Lord. But here, it's a promised land. God is molding you. Praise the name of our Lord. Like the Bible says, &gt;&gt; you know, in Matthew chapter 13, &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord. Matthew chapter 13, &gt;&gt; and then we read in verse 20. &gt;&gt; But he that received the seed in stony in stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and unknown with joy receiveth it. Yet that he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, by and by, he is offended. Now he said that's the one who received the word by the rock. You know when the trials come said I think I'm in the wrong place. &gt;&gt; So he thought everything should be smooth. You know the way they sing that song but it's not &gt;&gt; smooth right I was sometime we got the the the spokesperson of the UPDF I think about five years ago six years ago They were saying that there are some soldiers who were killed in the game park or somewhere or maybe they were training. Then he said, "Amen. It's not a walk in the park. You know, see good flowers, good singing, fresh breeze. He said that military is not a walk in the park. There are things you go through hard and even our life as a Christian. There are ways God has prepared for us that this time you are going to climb the hill. And you know climbing a hill. You know how you feel the breath is not enough. You feel the legs are paining you. It's not just ah it's a nice ride. But people want that kind of way. That is not the way of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. now in the message but was not so from the beginning. Brother Brandham says it was spoken by it was spoken to brother Brham &gt;&gt; on February 11th 1961 in the full gospel business men's breakfast because you have chosen the narrow path the harder way. Thou hast walked of thy own choosing. I can understand that Moses walked of his own, too. He didn't have to do it. I couldn't I could have maybe had big meetings, big things and great a lot of flowers and things too. This is the way I desired. Now you know it is so amazing with the gift that brother Brham had maybe many gifts. &gt;&gt; You know tens of thousands of people getting saved but he chose a humble way. Praise the name of our Lord. He chose a humble way. Like the church they had they had about 300 people. They only upgraded during the time of the se to 450. But for was not wanting it. But now with the ministry that he had, he was not looking to build a big stadium. Ah, you know, I'm a prophet of God. He have the biggest church around maybe a jet and everything. He chose a humble way. &gt;&gt; And then he said, "Though hast walked of your own choosing, though has picked the correct and precise decision, and this is my way. Because of this momentous decision, a huge portion of heaven awaits you. That's the vision which you'll get that he know nothing about it then. What a glorious decision thou hast made. This is what will give you and make to come to pass tremendous victory in love divine. And God says this narrow path harder way is my way. Praise the name of he said this is my way. It's a precise decision you have done. Praise the name of our Lord. And the children of Israel they never knew the way of the Lord. They thought the way of the Lord everything is going to be smooth throughout. They never knew. There are trials on the way. There are temptations on the way. You know there are things that are not pleasant on the way but yet it was the way of the Lord. You look what the heroes of faith You know, see how Moses was born and then he was protected in on the river, raised in Pharaoh's house. But for him to do the things of God, he had to deny the things of the world. He had to leave the comfort of Pharaoh's house. He had to be identified with the children of Israel who were suffering. Then the scripture saying he took on the riches of Christ, the suffering of Christ to be greater riches than the things of Egypt which perish for a short time. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 11. Praise the name of our Lord. Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 24. By faith, Moses, when he was come to Yaz, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt. For he had respect the recompense of the reward. Praise the name of our Lord. He took the narrow path. They had a way and that is the Lord's way. Praise the name of our Lord. And you know even like Daniel he had a choice to worship the idol or to go into the lion's d. The three Hebrew children they had to choose worship the image not to go into the fire the way of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in this in the message here healing and what sickness is he says and as long as we are getting acquainted. Okay let me start from here. Say God has two ways of all things that is the right way and the wrong way and your way and my way is the wrong way. God's way is always the right way. No matter how unright it seems to us, God's ways are true and right. They are past find they are past understanding. But God works in mysterious ways. His wonders perform. Now you can only come through faith. faith, not my faith, but in your faith, the individual faith. I might have faith in Jesus to be saved, but there has been many does not have faith to be saved. You cannot be saved until we have faith. I have faith in healing. Maybe you do not have faith in healing. So there is only one way for the Lord outside of the Lord. It's a wrong way. Praise the name of our Lord. So we always need to seek and find out which is God's way. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message all the days of our lives he says man is prone to have his own way man wants to do things but he wants to do it his own way. He showed that just a few hours after his fall in the garden of Eden, he wanted to do his way because man is always satisfied as long as he's doing his own way. Now that's the weakness of man. My own way, my own experience. But we need to depend upon God that he can guide us in his way. Praise the name of God. So now when he was leading the children of Israel, he told them, be aware that I'm sending my angel before you. In Exodus 23:20, &gt;&gt; behold, I send my angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him. Obey his voice. Provoke him not, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him. But if you indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I'll be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary unto your adversaries. Praise the name of our Lord. So he sends his angel that the angel of God may go ahead of us may lead us. And right now the angel of the Lord he has sent is the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of our Lord. He says in John 16:3, "How when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth. For he shall not speak of himself, but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and will show you things to come. Praise the name of our Lord. So God has sent us the Holy Spirit and the reason why the Holy Spirit has come is to lead us in the way of the Lord. That's what the Bible says. as many as are led by the spirit of God. So the Holy Spirit leads us guides us in the way of the Lord. And the way of the Lord is known in the word of God. But the Holy Spirit will not take you out of the word, but the Holy Spirit will guide you into the word because he guides us into all truth. He makes known to us the way of the Lord. Praise the name of God. So we can have confidence that when we have the spirit of God dwelling in us living in us, he will guide us to the paths of truth and righteousness. Praise the name of our Lord. And so you need to see that you walk in the way of the Lord. Some other people may not have any difference. But then for you, if you have the spirit of God, the spirit of God will guide you. One day, brother Brandham had gone for mission missions in Europe. And then I think I'm just forgetting the country. &gt;&gt; But it's a country which is neighboring Russia. Praise the name of our Lord. And then when they reached in that country, the people he was with, they were saying, "Ah, we are going out. We are going out to these or to these kind of places." And then now the Holy Spirit told him don't go there. Then he was wondering why. Then one of the brothers who was organizing the meetings came to him. And then he said, "Are you come here?" said ah. Then he would see men removing their clothes, put on towels and then go in a certain place. And then he saw some women also going where they were. Said, "No, you don't go there." He said no. They were just laughing at him. Then this brother was telling him, "You American, your American nurses or doctors, don't they examine the opposite sex? No, but that's not like this." But for them, they had comfort in doing that. You're not going to feel so good when you have that kind of thing. But the Holy Ghost said, "No, don't go there." Praise the name of our Lord. So the Holy Spirit knows what lays ahead of us. He knows the challenges. That's why you need to see that you depend on God every day. Lord, I'm starting out my day. I don't know what lays ahead of. Lord, I'm starting out the whole week. I don't know what lays ahead. Lord, I need a job. Guide me which kind of job I should get. Lord, I'm looking for a place where I'm going to live. I want you to guide me to a place where I'm going to live. So you don't take things for granted, you know, just saying anyhow, let me get this or let me be attracted by the physical things. Have you prayed over something you're doing? your friends, your people who are close to you. Do you commit to the Lord in prayer? Praise the name of our Lord because a wrong association can affect your Christian influence. Praise the name of our Lord or they can take you in the way of least resistance. Like in the message says is this the time there's a brother who had a dream and then he came and told brother Brana in the message says is this the time 136 paragraph he said I went to brother Biller and he he said down at his house one night when I was going on some calls He said, "Brother Brham, I had a strange dream." He said, "I dream that I was going down a stream of water [Music] towards the west. And there was a road on the left side. And I was on the left side going westward on the road. Seeming like hunting for cattle. And on the right side, I happened to notice that after I got down there, there you were. And you were rounding up a big bunch of cattle and there was plenty of feed over there and said, "Then you got this cattle and started them back up the river and seemingly that I must have nodded to him to watch over those cattle. And he said now if it now it will be easy for those cattle I know they will go the way of least resistance but brother Brandham wants them to stay on the right side of the river. So I'll go back up this road and keep them from going across the river on this side. I'll keep them on that side. But he noticed I never followed the cattle but went on westward. He said he must be hunting. Now in paragraph 39 139 he says now the interpretation of that dream is in so much that the stream was large. It was the stream of life. I was going westward on it and so was he because he was on a road. He was running small down this road and on the other side was lots of grass but lots of thicket you know bri thicket and jungle but in there was much grass and that's the way we hunt for the lord and the Food of the Lord through difficulty. Praise the name of our Lord through ticket. Praise the name of our Lord. Waiting on this waiting on this. Praise the name of our Lord. Sometimes you know you you start wondering what am I going to do? Like maybe when you're looking for something to minister that doesn't sometimes come that easy, you wait on this, wait on this. Then he said, but there is food there, but there's some difficulty to get it. And then he said, rounding up the cattle, rounding up the cattle was this church, keeping them on that side. K will actually go on the smooth road the denomination if they can which the road represent a denomination. I started him back up to see that they did not go to any denomination. So it is easy in this Christian life to go and do something wrong because it's easy to do it anyway. Very easy. But then the things of the Lord, praise the name of our Lord. You know it takes the grace of God to do the things of God. Praise the name of our Lord harder way, narrow way. Praise the name of our Lord. But then you know whom you have believed. and you are persuaded that is more than able to take you through whatever challenge that you are. Praise the name of Lord. So we need to see that we avoid the way of least resistance and take the way of the Lord is despising. Abraham and Lord, you know, when they had a contest, Abraham told Lord, if you go west, I'll go east. If you go south, I'll go north. And he gave him the best option, the best deal. He told him when you go this side I will go the other side. And brother Brandham says that's the best way to do it for a Christian. You give the other person the best deal. He decides himself. So Lord chose where he wanted. Then Abraham chose another path. But Abraham depended upon the Lord. Lord chose the wellwatered valleys of Sodom and Gomorra, you know, where there was watering, &gt;&gt; you know, so animals would not suffer, there was plent of grass, but the Bible says, the men of Sodom were evil continually. Sometimes those are the things you may have before you. I'm getting a lot of money here. What is the condition of your soul? The Bible says righteous Lord, righteous Lord living in Sodom and Gomorrah, it vexed his righteous soul. by the things he saw and by the things he heard. The animals were feeding well but his spiritual life. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in Genesis chapter 13, Genesis chapter 13 &gt;&gt; and then in verse verse 8, &gt;&gt; and Abraham said unto Lord, let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and you, and between my heartsmen and your heartsmen, for we are brethren. is not the whole land before you separate yourself. I pray you for me if you will take the left hand I'll go the right side. If you go depart on the right side I'll take the left side. So go and Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan. And it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. given as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as though comest unto Zora. and Lot chose all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed east and dispar themselves one from the other. And Abraham dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. [Music] See the Lord was influenced by the physical appearance. You know the benefits physical but he was not looking at the spiritual. So the world the people of the world will always look at the carnal things. If we are in the way of the Lord, check the spiritual. Praise the name of our Lord. The spiritual aspect. Is the Lord pleased what I'm going to do. Is this the way of the Lord? It is the wide way. Because the Bible says the wide way there are many people that find it. And the wide way leads to destruction. And there are many people who find that wide way. But there are few people who find the narrow path. And that was the decision of Abraham. I want to be where the Lord is despised. If you are, I want to take the way of the Lord. That's what decision of brother Brana narrow path. They had a past not popular. Not everybody is going to part on you. You are our man. You are our man. And in many meetings, brother Brandham when he preaches, then they will come and tell him. Oh, you have a great gift. But you should stop talking about women. Don't talk about how they dress, how they paint themselves. You are ruining your ministry. wide way. Become a popular preacher. Let everybody say this is our man. Be a motivational speaker. And then said you should teach people how to speak in tongues, get those gifts, give those things, the way they dress, how they conduct themselves. Then you would ask them, "How can I teach algebra? when they don't know A B C D always believe Christ the way of least resistance let everybody come whether you dress in what or you conduct what we are all going to heaven no it's not like that bring the witch doctors also in church but also God's people bring the worshipers also these ones also Jesus's mother was born there way of less resistance we are all going to heaven it's not like that Abraham had to choose the way of the Lord Lot looked at the waters the vegetation And then he pitched his tent there. And the Bible says, "The men of Sodom were so wicked and evil before the Lord exceedingly." And then that's where your your influence is. I want to be near, &gt;&gt; you know, in business. &gt;&gt; I need to get a shop and put it near that disco tech because there the business is there 24 hours. So you're there in the night doing funny things there. I make a lot of sales at night. He pitched his tent towards Sodom. Every doubt that would come should be able to know receive but his soul was vexed. Praise the name of Lord. So you see Lord he avoided the hard way. Even when Abraham was interceding for it, the angels came and then the angel was telling him run to the mountain. It was a harder way. He said, "Let me go to the city." He was used to city life just want to be in a city. When he went to that city, he thought the men are evil. He took off. The way of less resistance, the way of the Lord. Praise the name of Lord. The Bible says it is a harder way, a narrow path, but the Lord gives you grace to go through that way. Praise the name of our Lord. He says, I will not leave you. I will be with you even in you. So, he gives you the strength. You can imagine when Lot left Abraham then the Lord came and told Abraham look all over even where a lot has gone all this land I will give to you praise the name of Allah and that's what the Lord was telling brother Brham the Lord was telling brother it's a narrow path it looks despised looks not pleased but I have A huge portion of heaven awaiting you. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us finish with Genesis chapter 18. Praise the name of our Lord. And then verse 17. And the Lord said, shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do? Abraham chose the place where he would fellowship with God. He chose a place where the angels of God would come. Praise the name of our Lord. Like brother Brandham said that I'm a Nazerite. You know there is time he had to spend with the Lord. He wouldn't be like the others. So and so and so. He had to spend time with the Lord. So that would have that continuous fellowship. Praise the name of the Lord. So God said, will I from Abra what I'm going to do? Saying that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. For I know Abraham that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice, judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him. Praise the name of our Lord. God spoke about Abraham and God was interested in teaching Abraham. Now when Abraham learns from the Lord, he would obey what the Lord is teaching. He would teach his children what the Lord is teaching. And then what the Lord has promised would come to pass. God involved Abraham, involved him in his promises. Praise the name of Allah. That is part of the promises. And now this is my way, the way of the Lord. God desires us to choose his way. That is the way of the Lord. He has given us the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit is here to lead every one of us to lead you at your home, to lead you at your place of work, to lead you at your school, lead you in the community. Praise the name of our Lord. That's why we have the Holy Spirit is to guide us every time. The decisions that you make, the words that you speak, the actions that you do, just allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in the way of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. And then you'll have peace that surpasses all understanding. The joy of your salvation, you'll always be happy. When you find that you have done the things of the Lord, when they when they the disciples, when they were beaten, the Bible says, they came back rejoicing because God has counted them worthy for his name, led of the spirit of praise the name of our Lord. This is my way. And if it is the way of the Lord, we need to desire to walk in the word of God. Sometimes it's not pleasing to the eyes, but yet there is joy in it. Praise the name of our Lord. And the Bible says, "There is great joy. Praise the name of our Lord." Psalms 19 in keeping of them. There is great joy. Psalms 19 and then verse verse 10. &gt;&gt; More to be desired are they than fine gold than much fine sweeter than honey and honeycomb. Verse 10. Psalms 19:10. Moreover, by them is your servant warned, and in the keeping of them there is a great reward. Praise the name of our Lord. There is great reward. Just take the way of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. There is protection in it. There is comfort in it. Praise the name of our Lord. You know when they they left the Lord Jesus Christ. They deserted him. He told them, "I'm not alone." Praise the name of our Lord. I'm with the Lord. Praise the name of And the Lord always comes down to help you in the challenges you are in. When Daniel was in the lion's day, God sent his angel and stopped the mouth of the lion. When the three children were in the fire, God himself came down. Praise the name of the Lord. So we know in the narrow path, the harder path, the Lord will always be present with you. Praise the name of our Lord that you can be encouraged that you can feel strengthened. When Jacob was running away from Esau and he was tired and then he put a stone for a pillow, the Lord came in that night and showed his presence to said, "I'm going to be with you. Even where you're going, I will bring you back." Praise the name of Lord. What a consolation we have that regardless of the trials that we go through, regardless of the challenges we go through, the Lord is always present with us. Praise the name of our Lord. So if you in the wilderness, when there is no water is the one who creates the water. Praise the name of our Lord. So if you're in a you have no food at home, he's the one who brings food. If you're in a situation, you are so weak. You see you can't move forward. He's always present. Praise the name of Allah. Like when God told Abraham, I am God with breast, the blessed one, telling an old man. He was telling an old man, "Come and from my breast. Receive the promises of God. to have strength to continue moving forward. When Abraham was afraid, I'm going to die and I have no hair, he said, this is what's going to be your generation. Praise the name of the Lord. We just need to wait on the Lord and then the Lord will take us through the pathway into his way. Praise the name of our Lord. Sing that song, they that wait upon the Lord. May God bless you. Amen. Amen. Song number 10. As the song leader comes to lead us in worship, then we start the Lord's supper. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount with wings as an eagle. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not teach me Lord. Teach me Lord through way.
