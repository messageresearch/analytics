let's get to our Bibles and return to the Book of Exodus chapter 12 and read from verse 11 amen amen and thus shall you eat it with your loins guarded your shoes on your feet and your stuff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall beat to you for a token upon the heart houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy when I SM the land of Egypt amen amen we are all familiar with this scripture we have all read about the condition that God said that God had said for Moses and the children of Israel when he was about resue them from the hand of the Egyptians praise the Lord let's to Matthew 25:6 and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lambs and the foolish said unto the wi give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out and the foolish verse but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut add a blessing to his word we may get seated amen amen so now where we started from we started with the Exodus we started with Israel in Egypt praise the lord we have read of these scriptures about the Passover and we have read and heard about the scriptures talking about the the foolish and the wise now we in Exodus when God had given instructions praise the Lord he gave an instruction to to to Moses and Aon to take to the children of Israel and tell them of what God required of them for their redemption in that day praise the Lord so now God only required that condition to be fulfilled the rest of the things were left for him praise the Lord for the Bible says and thus shall you eat it and with your Lo guarded your shoes on on your feet and your stuff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste in haste it is the Lord is Passover now when they were going to eat this Passover God told them what how they were supposed to be dressed told them how prepared they needed to be because it was going to be a take off praise the Lord and it says now when your feet are guarded when you have your shoes on and you have your Lo guarded and then you have your stuff in your hands and when you shall eat it in haste then I will pass through the land of Egypt and what he required when the Lord was going to pass the land of Egypt that night he says I will only require one token that is the blood praise the Lord and says now when I shall pass through the land when I look at the token which is the blood upon the lint I shall pass over you but now to the household which did not have the blood regardless of whether they were Israelites praise the Lord or they were Egyptians if they did not have the blood upon the L they were doomed but whoever had the blood which is the token I will pass over you praise the Lord and now in Matthew chter 26 where we read the Bible says and at midnight there was a cry in Egypt praise the Lord the voice that came down said get ready make sure that you are ready make sure that you have blood on the lint which is the token that God requires now here at the Midnight Cry there was also a requirement something that was required for the bride to have praise the Lord before they would be saved or before they would go in with a bridegroom and the says and at midnight there was a cry behold the bridegroom come out to meet him when the cry went out everyone that had a cry to check themselves see if they were ready the Lord now they check their LS their LS to light up their lamps to see if there was oil to light them up illuminate their way it could lighten their way as they going out to prise the Lord and now in the two instances we see that here it was in the night when the angel was going to pass over in the land of Egypt it was in the night and now here when the bridegroom was coming it was still dark praise the Lord now in Egypt it had be the blood it had to be the blood toen now here at the mid it to be the oil in the lamb toen praise the Lord when they Shake themselves there are those that found themselves wanting praise the Lord they found that they had not enough oil light up their L to meet the Bri so now they went inquire those that had o other words they had not prepared themselves praise the Lord they were not ready to receive the bride and the Bible says when they went to inquire other five wise on they said unto them we do not have enough oil praise the Lord why because they did not have the authority to distribute part of the O which they had and they told them you got those that sell praise the lord we bought from those that sell and now this sign here is the talking of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord the wise virgin they had had the message they had heard the word of God received the word of God they obeyed the word of God walked by the word of received the Holy Spirit which is the oil in their lamps and each time the message went out get ready have the shoes on your feet have the stuff in your hand tonight I over I pass around the of Egypt I SM whoever does not have the token praise the Lord they gathered themselves they held to the word Obed to the word collected the oil and they ready to meet the Bri the foolish ones asked to go out go out and buy of the oil but yet it was too late for them Lord it was very late for them for the time had come for the bridegroom to come in the says as they went out behold the badroom entered praise the Lord and by the time they came they came back the door had been shut praise the nameing so now when we go back to the Book of Exodus praise the Lord the instruction that we are being given they were given to the head of the house praise the Lord and now the head of the house who is the father had the responsibility over the household and he had to make the household ready for the Passover praise the Lord he had to get the sacrifice ready had to kill him apply the blood the rest of the household dependent upon the father but the father had receive the message and he had to take the responsibility to make the message known to the people household praise the Lord and I would wish to like it today who is the father to the church and what is the Lamb involved in the sacrifice literally the father be liken to the spiritual leader to the leader the messenger would be the pastor Lord under the anointing of the Holy Spirit receives the message he receives the word he receives the inspiration bring the inspiration to the people re the word from God bring the same to the peopleare them to make them ready for the Bri praise the Lord so now the father was Restless until the sacrifice was done the blood was sprinkled the L praise the Lord and I want to say this that today we have that father praise the Lord who God speaks to to prepare our household praise the Lord he lab day in day out to prepare the sacrifice to make it ready and he's not at rest until the household is ready he very well knows that the life of the entire family the life of the household and their success their blood is is on his hands he is restless until the entire flock is rest under the blood praise the Lord and God has put a burden upon they have received from him they receive from him put upon them praise the Lord that's why they are restless they spend sleepless night trying to search through the scriptures they get the inspiration they get out the Bible they start searching the scripes they prepare it bring that message to the peopleare them for the rapure praise the Lord so they wake up in the morning they sleep they preparing bring the flock Under full protection BL which literally is the fresh words praise the Lord this what they are preparing to apply to the flock so now the pastor is simply a veil and behind him the Lord the Holy Spirit behind him is God proclaiming his man to the people behind him is God himself trying to tell the people to get ready praise the Lord the father was simply a represent praise the Lord God needed a father in the house and he received the instruction and if he did not execute the instructions had been given of him the household was doomed praise the Lord that's why he became so restless and if he did not have enough receive the bread Grom all conditions all instances there was something that was required to make them ready we need a token we need the Holy Spirit to prepare us for the Rapture the Holy Spirit prepare our lives receive the brid praise the Living God I said behind this behind him is God and now behind this God revealing himself the church God revealing to the hard condition the hard conditions of the people to the pastor praise the Lord so now the pastor is already receiving from God setting himself aside praise the Lord receive and when he gets The Inspirations whether he's driving whether he's in the fields when the inspiration comes he gives it attention the Lord he does whatever he's doing so fast go and sit down and settle and prepare what speaking the Lord that's why many times people pastors are persons who are not sometimes very free in the public they have a life which is a life of a sacrifice they sacrifice their Pleasures the Lord they sacrifice their time set it for God speak to them come and feed the FL the Lord so when they out there they still listening to him and now when Hees from now goes down and he begins to pray waiting upon the Lord expound it more maybe the picture is not coming the vision is not clear so he sits down to search the scriptures and is searching the scriptures God is revealing your condition to him praise the Lord why because you have a need and now your need must be addressed God himself when he sits down under the of the Holy Spirit God is speaking to him he picks up the SC and then he picks up the scripture and he picks up this quot God get him this quotes when he comes here and he's speaking exactly what you're going through addressing your needs praise the Lord what is that is God speaking through himare the bride for the Rapture praise the Living God and now he gots the flock that no walls should come me praise the Lord he guards it so he sacrifices so now all the burdens of the church all your burdens all your failures all your TR all your persecutions all upon Him Praise the Lord because he has to come with the words which must address your condition and to do that they must sacrif praise the Lord they sacrifice to prepare themselves to prepare that which is Fit for Your Heart praise the Living God that's why the church must be in support we must pray for them we must keep them ministers in prayer Lord because all our burdens are upon them all our weaknesses upon them and they must fight and they must be obedient so we can go through an over praise the Lord so there was a Midnight Cry and the cry was like behold the bridegroom cold the bridegroom C there was a message going on praise the Lord prepare yourselves behold the briad and the same voice running out praise the Lord speaking to the church speak the bride of Christ prepare yourselves hold the bridegroom make yourself ready dress yourself the full arm of the word of God your feet with your shoes on your breasts on get ready the bridegroom cometh praise the Living God now this sets the church this sets the world into a condition of preparing themselves to receive the bridegroom praise the Lord there is a message that is going out praise the Lord there is a message that is going out to the entire church to the world to prepare themselves praise the Lord and we know that everything God is doing today has already told us through the scriptures what it must be there was a vision that came to Isaiah praise the Lord let's get there let's get to Isaiah chter 21 verse one the burden in the the burden of the desert of the sea as whir winds in the South pass through so it comes from the desert from a terrible land a Grievious vision is declared unto me the treacherous dealer dealth treacherously and the spoiler spoil go up Oham Bes oh media all the sign thereof have I made to seiz therefore are my loins filled with pain puns have

in the vision in the middle of the night God gives him a vision God gives isah a vision Vision about the city and now he gives him the word he gives him this message to tell the people in the city what was coming before them the Lord says tell them what you see was standing in position to receive from God and then tell the message to the people says tell them exactly what you see he turn to see
