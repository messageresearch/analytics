unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Lord did not see did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had shown unto your fathers has the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of born men from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt [Music] [Music] amen we may get seated amen amen so we are picking up from our context of last Wednesday we saw praise the Lord where we looked at the a New Covenant and a better praise the Lord where we saw how God that made a covenant with Abraham and how God is faithful to keep his Covenant that he makes with his children praise the lord we saw how the children of Jacob and the generations theref how they fall favor before the sight of the Lord not because they were worthy but because God had established a covenant with their fathers and we saw how God worked Faithfully with the people praise the Lord and how he promised them a land that he had promised to his servant Abraham and how he promised that land and how that Generations there after come and that land and we saw how God does m allowed 4 years afterwards and after that God still visited his word to come and fulfill his promise that made with Abraham and we saw that he's the same yesterday to done forever and we saw that in this generation in the New Testament praise the Lord he gave us another better test another better Covenant by the blood of Jesus Christ a covenant and two children a covenant to be called children of God a where he chooses us and brings us to himself then he tells us he's going up to prepare place for us and how that he would come back to take us to himself in the rupture and how we see that if God was faithful in the Old Testament and after all those many years he still kept the Covenant that he made with abrah and how we are confident that the same God who never changes will still visit us our day with this new and better Covenant praise the Lord and we are hopeful that one day it shall come to pass that the bride shall not be praise the Lord but that Christ will come and take the himself why because it is a promise that he gave his promises never fail praise the Lord and out of the same context tonight I want us to take a ride in the elective love of God the elective love of God praise the Lord so now as we read from the book of Genesis last week how God had visited Abraham remember AB Wasing the moon AB Wasing Idols because he was in a nation in a land that knew not God but how God chose AB not because abrah was the best of all the people that living the of the Earth but God chose Abraham because he loved him praise the Lord abrah did not have the best character God chose Abraham he loved him praise lot and now here when God was speaking the children of Israel reminding them of his elective love reminding them of how he chose ABR and how Abraham had not done anything good before the sight of the Lord but God had chosen him by himself so now here God reminds his people and says in verse for thou Unholy people unto th God why because he has chosen you to himself and he says the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself all that upon the face of the Earth praise the Lord he says he has chosen thee he has chosen you to be a special people and the New Testament calls it people special people who have been called Praise the Lord so now here God calls them as special people and says the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people so here this scripture praise the Lord it sets out a president that God did not choose us not choose to love us because we had special conditions that we fulfilled how we saw last week that the love of God is unconditional and this election is unconditional that's why when he went to choose Abraham he didn't set out conditions for Abram praise the Lord and when he made Covenant with abrah he still never set up conditions with ABR all he required of Abraham was obedience praise the Lord and when Abraham accepted the voice of God and he obeyed the voice of the Lord and he left his country and he left his household and he moved to a place that God had chose now it was now in the hands of God of Abram that's why God set out a covenant and said by this I shall be reminded of your obedience praise the Lord and in the same manner God has set out a covenant because when he loved us he has loved so many people and he has called so many people not everyone has obeyed the voice of the Lord in this day so now because he has loved us still gave us a same promise a same Covenant those that have that have accepted the voice when I called out when I was choosing those that accepted the voice of the messenger and obey the voice of the messenger I have a special place set for them that's why he said I go prepare a place for you you who he has called Praise the Lord who he has set before the table those that are feeding daily before the table he said I have not called you to leave you on the table but behold I go up to prepare a place for you praise the Living God and he said but remember I have chosen you because I loved you not because you had any special attributes not because you are so many in number not because you are rich not because you of a special character but simply because I loved you and because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the O which had shown with his with your fathers now who are our fathers B says we are Abraham's seed and we become Abraham's seed by obedience praise the lord we become Abraham SE by obedience to the word of God pra the Lord because when we obey God gives us his life the messeng teaches us that total obedience to the word of God praise the Lord to the baptism of the holy spirit so now when we obey the voice of God to OB the voice of the messenger praise the Lord and you accepted and when you heard the voice you accepted and when you accepted you obey the voice and you started moving in the direction of that voice and we left the comfort the comfort and we chose the way of the Lord prise the Lord and the way of the Lord is not smooth but it is rugged because we accepted to be loved by our loved ones we accepted to be rejected to be called all sorts of names for the word's sake because we we obey that voice we rejected of our families for the sake of the word god establishes a covenant with us and the Covenant is the Covenant of eternal life when Abraham accepted to be rejected of the family because he chose to worship and only serve the true Living God praise the Lord he was rejected because he left his family and he never turned back and because of his commitment to the [Applause] words God accepted him because of our toward the word because of youred towards the word god accepted us and he loved us and he chose us and he showed us his word so when you go by the way of his word it is upon is his duty praise the Lord to one fill with the Holy Spirit why because the Holy Spirit which is the life of God must eliminate our paths it must shine through our paths which is the light and darkness praise the Living God so now we become Abraham's SE after we have obeyed the voice of God and when he gives us his life this life prepares us for the eternal life why because the life that he gives us is the life of God which is eternal but now when abrah was moving along the way praise the Lord because his body was not yet glorified Abraham also went through certain challenges in life he was tested but through it all he held first the Le of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord he always remember the Covenant of God because in the Covenant God promised abrah that I will give you a son shall be here your inheritance and each time Abram was moving when he fed remember the Covenant that God had made with him and he held back to that promise 25 years later had grown old but because he had hope and his hope never ran out God visited him Accord to the time of life and got a son faithful to the word of God so when we are faithful to he who called us he establishes our Fai he provides for the way praise the Lord he gives us strength when we are becoming weak praise the Lord he gives us words of Courage when becoming wary because he knows that the journey is not easy but praise the Lord he is bound and he provides sufficient Grace praise the Lord Abraham never fell he remained faithful though at some point as a man praise the Lord when the people were laughing at him when people were rejecting him because he held to the promise praise the Lord until even Sarah thought maybe the promise was not going to come through Abraham and he compelled ha praise the Lord and He compelled Abraham to go in for he so they could bear a child praise the Lord even when Abraham had produced is is was not according to the order of God and God still reminded ABR that your SE must come from Sarah and even when Sarah was becoming very old God Contin reminding Abraham be patient with me praise the Lord and he walked one year he W two years he walked three years he walked 10 years and he was still faithful in his work 20 years and he was still hoping upon the Lord and 25 years the Lord visited him praise the Lord and the Lord established him but we see that even after God had provided Abraham with a child exposed him to another trial and remember the Bible says the trying of our face sou patience it works sou patience so when Abraham was being Tri was working out patience for him and he became patient with God and wherever God L him Abraham went to the extent that even after looking at his son praise the Lord even when God came down and told him this only son that I have given unto you I want him for a sacrifice because Abraham learn patience praise the Lord he still became patient with God and He waited upon the Lord and says the one that you've given me I will offer him unto you and he him up and he was obedient to the voice and because he was obedient God provided a sacrifice God provided a sacrifice for Abraham and now when Abraham was done being God looked at him and he sealed him praise the Lord God sealed him that's why Abraham holds a special position before God all the C of Abraham all the SS of Abraham have a special place before God he has said to the children of Israel four generations after Abraham is gone he says I have called you Unholy people before me special people because I loved you praise the Lord because he loved us he has called us a special people and just called us to himself praise the Lord and He that has called us is not ready to lose us he that has called us is not ready to lose us praise the Lord because when he called us he called us for a purpose that we we made manifest his life in the end times prise the Lord that when he comes back he's able to find a life on Earth so he that called us is still very faithful and patient with us he is not going to lose us until the purpose which he loved and chose us comes to pass and that purpose is eternal life so until eternal life God is not ready to lose you the prophet says I heard someone saying what if he would backslide and back what if you would back slide and back you could do that you could do that well I'm lost out with god well I'm lost out with God lost out with God if you were ever found with him you will never be lost with him because God can't save you and then turn his back on you and Turn you and Turn you away if he would he defeats his on purpose so he can't do that praise the Lord if if you were ever found with him if he ever chose you to himself you never get lost he says he can't save you at the same time turn his back on that makes him get defeated the purpose for which he called us so that assurance that he that called us he that started the work in Us Faithful Is He that he shall dve us to the end praise the Lord and says because if Christ the same yesterday done forever his power is the same his atude is the same and just as he was then he is now and will be forever you just can't take nothing from him that's all praise the Lord and in another message in the church ages he says now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he St the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation so when he called us the the prophet says it does not take out the tribulation from coming our way when he called Abram and says I shall bless you with a son he never took away trials out of Abraham's way and each time Abraham was tried and tested the prophet says God stands out and says yeah I know I know your tribulation I know your trying moments I am not all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people what a stumbling block this is to so many people Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by if he stands by and watches his people suffer shall the service Israel when God had visited them and they were on their Journey they had many stumbl they stumbled of times and when they stumbled they were blaming God they thought God was not just they thought God was not faithful praise the Lord and they somehow thought that God had left them that he had turn himself away from them but the prophet says God is still mindful of for suffering God says I know your tribulation praise the Lord and now these on saw that God was watching that God stood and was simply watching them suffering and that's what they asked you know we were reading last week about KES in the Book of Numbers around vers 30 and now when they came to the chapter 14 the Bible says they were complaining and they were complaining until they said AR andto Moses they said why did God bring us here he would kill us together with our children why did God leave us in Egypt though we were suffering but we were not dying so now when they looked at their suffering that God had deserted them and the prophet tells us he says I know praise the Lord and now they even told Moses they wanted captains allow us to get ourselves Captain to take us back to where you face praise the Lord they had run short of that of that patience they had forgotten the works that God did for Abraham they had also forgotten the works that God had done for them through the Wilderness and because they were here at Kadesh and were afraid of the people that were in the land they were now complaining and telling Moses we know we cannot defeat them praise the Lord the patience that they had through the Red Sea they had run short of it they said Moses allow us to get ourselves caped you have failed your God has failed Prophet says Paul says I know I know your suffering so when he call us out we are often told we are often told that the Journey of the Israelites is a shadow of the Journey of the believer Journey it's a shadow of the Journey of the Bride fromon from the unbelieving world and now shows us that when he chose them and he gave them Moses to lead them to the promised land praise the Lord God never deserted them his presence was always with them through all their weaknesses God was still with them praise the Lord when they reached Mara and they were complaining to Moses they wanted water they were thirsting and they wanted water and now they turn to Moses and says give us water and Moses didn't have water and they began to complain and cry and says now why did you leave us there each time they found difficult they remembered where they came from but God's presence never left them even when they M and complains the presence of God still remained in their presence their m in the day he provided a cloud to guide them even when they were complaining the cloud was still there watching over them and directing them and that's how faithful our God is that when he called us out of Egypt when he called us out of Babylon when call us out of the unbelieving world out of them denominations God sets his eye upon us and the Bible says the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous his eyes never deser the righteous why because he knows that the righteous have his righteousness and God is protective of his own life so he sets his eyes upon the righteous praise the Lord so many times sometimes the righteous also complains because of the situation when it's becoming very hot they look out and complain says but if God was really faithful and if he's really God why would I be going through all these challenges but God is eyes never set out of us his eyes are straight on us to look at us to direct our feet and when we are giving up he now comes down to give us strength he says when you're weak then are you strong why my grace is sufficient for you the grace of God is sufficient for us in this J that we are moving the grace of God is sufficient praise the Lord his grace was sufficient upon these people so when they come praying praise the Lord because The Waters at Mar were very bitter when they tested of it it was bitter they complained but it was the working of God was working out patience praise the Lord he says do not do not worry of the suffering of the tribulation of the trials that you shall face because these trials are working out patience for you praise the name of the Living God Abraham the tri he went through we working out patience and when he got a hold of him praise the Lord when he saw the promise he to manifestation he gave up himself and he surrendered to God praise the Lord when we come to the promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit when we get that confirmation of the life of God in us we surrender ourselves unto him and whatever he says I will do whatever he leads I will follow praise the Lord that's why when God tells Abraham that your boy I want him prepare yourself prepare firewood prepare a good knife I want him tonight Abraham was not hant why because the trials that he had gone through had worked out patience praise the Lord and even when he reached that time of giving up his son Abraham still trusted God why because whatever he had gone through the 25 years buil patience in ABR praise the Living God so now Prophet says they thought God had turned his face from them that is what they they asked in Malachi 13 1 to 13 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I love I have loved you says the Lord yet we say where in hast thou loved us was not es Jacob's brother say the Lord yet I L Jacob and I hated and his mountains and his Heritage West for the dragons dragons of the Wilderness elective God When the Children of Israel were forcing their way in and they were complaining the Bible says here God asked them isn't es Jacob's brother and yet by elective love I chose Jacob over [Applause] es praise the Lord so when we look at ourselves praise the Lord we do not have to compare ourselves our successes our spiritual stand with the people of the world why because we are a royal seed elective love God has chosen us to be called our special people people he says now among all of them haven't I loved you haven't I showed you my love I showed you my truth why have I rejected why have I loved Jacob why have I rejected the world and why have I chosen you give you my truth has chosen us to give us his truth he will protect his truth us he says chosen jaob rejected and given all his irit to of the of the Wilderness and yet I have loved Jacob and I have blessed him God has loved us God has loved us by himself not because there's something we can do for him Israel thought God would love them because there is something they did and when he looked at them he caued them and says do you think I have loved you you are so many in number yet you the fewest upon the face of the Earth you think I have loved you because you have the best character some of us he found us in the dungeons of the world he found us in the fness of the world and he rejected those that we of character and he chose us amidst our weaknesses he chose us because he loved us because of elective love because he loved us and he wanted to make a bride out of us not because we were wored be called a bride of Christ because of his elective life at Jacob as a man was so sub praise the Lord but yet God loved him look at is very gentle un faithful God rejected God is love is elective praise the Lord so when he loved us he elected us before the foundation of the world he loved us because he chose us to be his bright praise the Lord there's nothing much we can do to it simply because he loved us praise the Lord and now the prophet continues to say now Israel when they were tested of the goodness of the Lord and later fac Affliction became doubtful they started doubting the power of the that delivered them out of Pharaoh's hand why they couldn't understand God is love they couldn't understand his elective love they looked at themselves and often compared with Egypt praise the Lord when they looked at their task Masters they could look at themselves and doubt if truly God loved them and if TR God chose them they looked at pharaoh and they looked at the people in the pharaoh's house how they were they well and they looked at themselves and there was nothing good to them they said but surely there is nothing that God could love to us because we not good after all we don't have the skills to fight but yet God did not set out conditions to choose them and to love them he simply loved them by election he elected them through their fathers and whatever he was doing it was based upon that love the scripture tells us praise the Lord in Ephesians chapter 1 blessed be blessed be the God and father of our Jesus Christ who has loved us who has chosen us who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings who chose us before the foundations of the world so that means even before we were he had chosen us even before we were he had loved us praise the Lord so we don't present anything before him for him to love us but he loved us by election praise the Lord and he shows us his Mercy by election he show shows us his love all by election his love is elective love praise the Lord regardless of our weaknesses if he has called us has chosen us and we have been F of him he is not going to turn his face away from us we can be confident that we shall see him we can be confident that we shall be in the rapture we can be confident that we are the bride that God has chosen himself because he has chosen reveal his Mysteries before us he shows us that we can come into countenance we can come into count with his presence in the message of the praise the Lord there are so many land people land people who have been taught praise the Lord by from the beginning are still young they have been taught the word they have gone to to those kind of of of of studies in the church you know what happens in the Catholic church when the child is they given to the church as they grow there are certain lessons they have to undergo being Tau God but yet God did not choose us because we were taugh God but he chose us because he loved us praise the Lord so many of them have been told he has not chosen chosen us who did not have any knowledge of him chosen us who are completely lost has given us his word he has given us the revelation of the hour given us the light of the day that we can come into countenance with the purpose of God for our day is his elective love praise the Lord so why should we look at ourselves and see we our St is not worth of him your St has nothing to do with his elective love praise the Lord why we look at ourselves and our backs judges ourselves praise the Lord God has not chosen us because we have a good background in fact if you are to look most of us we are chosen from one of the worst back went out and says Abraham I have loved you and I have chosen you he says my son daughter whether you know not God I have chosen you and this is the truth and he showed us the truth praise the Lord and remember he knows that along the way we shall be rejected we shall have Mage but yet he's patient with us praise the Lord he was patient with the children of Israel because the purpose of their calling was to inherit the land so when they mmed God was still patient the Bible says in ex 16 verse and the whole Congregation of of Israel mmed against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and the children of Israel said unto them would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat by the flesh BS and when we did eat bread to full for ye have brought us forth into this Holiness to kill this whole assem with that's what they thought but yet God not bring them up there to St them those sufferings would work out patience prise the Lord the sufferings work out patience and the prophet says now it is God that chose these people they were not aware of the Covenant God made with their father Abra moved before God he was tested of God remained faithful in his work praise the Lord and why he never chose God he never looked for God God looked for Abraham God located Abraham so he had no effort in the calling and the Covenant Abra never had any effort it was the elective love that God that God located chose him and when the trials be him he was still patient and at some point you know he B to the weight of care to the weight of care praise the Lord and he accepted the coun of Sarah and he produced isma and at some point praise the Lord when when he was in lack he gave up his wife and says you say you are my sister he also went through such trials praise the Lord but God still loved him for one reason he was obedient to the calling praise the Lord and now you see they could not figure out God's love they saw that love meant not suffering they saw that love meant a baby with parental [Applause] care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love his election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen un salvation because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and believe of the truth so God chose Abraham salvation praise the Lord through belief of the truth he may commit you to death he may commit you to death as did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while be made perfect be established strengthened settled praise the Lord that is the purpose it says that we would be made perfect will be established in his words we will be strength and settled as job said he puts his strength in US job made perfect by the things he suffered see he himself suffered that's Jesus and he learned obedience by the things which he suffered he was actually made perfect the things that he suff Christ who is our footprint a perfect example for us he himself he suffered you open not his mouth to C God because he lived the life of a purpose to redeem us back to himself in Hebrews 5: no man makes no man takes his honor unto himself but he that is called of God as was Aon four 54 so also Christ glorified not himself be made an high priest but he that said unto him Thou Art my son today have I begotten thee as he also said in another place thou art a priest Forever After the order of MEC speaking about Jesus Christ verse who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with his strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from from death and was Hur in that he [Music] feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffer and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him obedience by the things which he suffered he is our we learn obedience we learn patience by the things that we suffer remember the beginning of the scripture says the prophet when was teaching inan Church age he said says through your suffering I know through your tribulation I know through your lacking I know and in plain language Prophet says the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they to by faith in suffering for him would come to a place of perfection praise the so the prophet teaches us here that according the teaching of PA that Christ has also left a measure of suffering that's why when we are suffering we don't need to Cur God we don't need to cry sometimes we shall cry because the St may seem so praise the Lord but the prophet says God has left us a measure of by fath while we suffer where we patiently wait upon the Lord through those sufferings challenges through the of Life while we wait upon God patiently in prayer that we would come to a place of perfection why he want this the Bible says in James 1 verse myen count it all joy when you follow into div Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith Works patience but let patience have have perfect [Applause] work that they that ye may be perfect and enti wanting nothing has left a measure of suffering a he says there is no temptation there is no trial God allows to come your way that which you able to over so now through that moment says God has left us a measure that by faith in himout that moment we come to our place of perfection we come to our place of Victory why does he stand by and look on in in in in Romans 8 ver 17 and if children then hairs of God and Joints with chist if so be that we suffer with him the scripture tells us through our suffering with our faith in God we are suffering together with him he does not stand by but he is with us through it all patience praise the Lord bringing us un Perfection bringing our bodies sub the word of God bring us into obedience the word of God that through suffering suffer with him that we may also be glorified [Applause] together for I Recon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the joy which shall be revealed in us 18 so unless we suffer with him we canot with him the reason for this is that character is never made without suffering that's the prophet character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't rain because power apart from character is satanic without so the suffering works out character but Power with character Fe to rule remember the Bible says if we suffer with him we shall be glorified together with him we Ser with him we shall also re with him praise the Lord that's the B says that the suffering that we go through now the rejection praise the Lord cannot be compared to the glory that shall be revealed in Us Praise the Lord so when we suffer we suffer together with him and same we suffer says by faith in God we come to our point of perfection when we suffer by prayer and supplication by prayer and supplication we come into patience and he says and the little tempor suffering go through is not whether to be compared that REM Glory that will be revealed in us when it comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those that are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation think it not strange the trials that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering sir and all we have trials but we are all tried and ched not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God praise the Lord Hebrews 12: 6 for whom the Lord L he ches every son whom he receive but if you be without tainment where of all are partakers are you bastards are not Sons now this special condition is must be applied to every age is no free from it there is no True Believer free from it this is of god this is the will of God it is needful we need the law to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it love suff and His Kind blessed you when men shall rev you and persecute you that you sh and shall say all manner of evil of evil against you falely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you his approval of of is only in the Beloved his love is which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so man that he did love us for he brought us unto himself and gave us his Spirit blessing us sons and shall how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass obedience believing what he said and being conducting ourselves with joy it is hard is hard for us conduct ourselves with joy am the trials that's what the prophet teaches us praise the Lord by conducting our soul with joy amid the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass praise the Lord all this work together for good to the elect praise the Lord Romans 8 as we close and we know verse 28 and we know that all the things work together for good to them that love the Lord to them who are called according to his purpose 28 for whom he did for for he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren he knew us prated he called us to be ConEd the Lord and now it is written in Romans chapter 9 for he say to Moses I will have mercy I will have mercy and I will have compassion I have compassion so then it is not of him that will it is not on whom them that will to be conformed to Children Of God it's not upon them that are of good character be ConEd the children of God of him that run but of God that shows Mercy I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy I choose Those whom I have mercy so the choosing of God is elective he says I will have mercy so he mercy upon me mercy upon you and he chose you I'll have mercy on whom I'll have mercy I'll show Grace whom I'll choose to show Grace God must choose a bright God chooses he does not call us to himself by accident but calls us because he chose us before the foundation of the world praise the Living God for thou art Unholy people the Lord th unto the Lord thy God I'll have mercy I'll have mercy when we found Mercy before his sight he says Thou Unholy people the Lord thy God the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people to himself above all that upon the face of the earth and the Lord did not set his love upon you choose you because we were special but because the Lord loved us and because he would keep the which he saw our fathers I will have mercy on whom I'll have mercy the love of God is elected and his love is shed upon us and it keeps us through this journey the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are ever open to their prayers so we can gladly speak to him through our suffering we can gladly speak to him through our Affliction we can speak to him through our joy why
