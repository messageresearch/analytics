you happy to be here this afternoon amen so I will take you through uh the preaching of the word and then Pastor shall take us through the uh the communion amen so you you preer for me such that I may only speak what the spirit wants to speak amen so let's I'll take you to the Book of Exodus 12 amen a very usual scripture we've read and we saw talk about it so many times amen so let's see what the spirit says this we shall read verse one up to verse 5 we shall get seated and read following scriptures when we are seated amen and the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of month it shall be the first month of the year to you to all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house and if the household be too little for a lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make you count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats amen may the Lord bless his word we may get amen amen so as you SE let's go through verse 67 11 12 and 13 verse six says and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the conation of Israel shall kill it in the evening is and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat and thus shall you eat it with your loins guarded your shoes on your feet and and your stuff in your hand you shall eat it in in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house houses where you are and when I see the blood I will Passover you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I made the land of [Music] Egypt praise the Lord so we all know this scenario we have read this scripture so many times how God instructed Moses how God gave Moses a message praise the Lord to take to the children of Israel in bondage praise the Lord and how the people received the message praise the Lord and now it came to a Time of Separation praise the Lord because Moses had preached this message to the people in the land regardless of whether it was an Israelite or it was an Egyptian remember they were mixed up praise the Lord the children of Israel were born servants and then they had their masters who are the Egyptians so it was a mixed congregation but now this message that Moses brought to the people was going to separate praise the Lord was a message of separation between those that we are predestinated to receive it praise the Lord and those that we are not and so he preached the message the way the message had been given unto him so now Moses goes to the congregation and begins to preach the message together with Aon and they begin to tell the people what the word of the Lord had say praise the Lord and now whosoever was predestinated to hear this message and believe it believed it and it caused an impact on their lives whoever was not predestinated they listened to the message they enjoyed Moses's teaching but they did not believe what Moses preached and it also caused the difference the prophet teaches us in one of the messages I think it's a message desperation that this message that we preach we preach it to everyone we preach it to every individual in yes but we know that this message is meant to reach out to a specific soul that was known before the foundation of the world but does not stop us from preaching this message that's why Moses went ahead to preach the message any until the message reached the Final Destination praise the Lord and now at the end of the message the scripture says that I will pass through the land of Egypt this was a message of judgment and Moses was telling them after all the plagues that have hit this land there is coming another plague the plague of death and was telling them to guard themselves was giving them the instructions that God had given unto him and was telling the people to go and get a l for what for sacrifice why because the angel that was going to pass that night it was looking for something specific it was something that had to identify a household with the message that had been preached that was the token praise the Lord so he told them go and kill the lamb bring this lamb kill it and then apply the blood on the door post praise the name of the Living God and so it did not matter how much of this message you had if you had not applied the blood on the door post this could hit your house praise the Lord and now this is where the Prophet calls it a separation separating The Believer from the unbeliever praise the Lord because they believe when they heard this word they believed it and theyken to this what and they went into their fields they got the Lambs killed them and applied the blood and they believed on what Moses had told them of whether it was coming to pass or not they believed it and applied the token praise the Lord and now in verse 13 it says and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I pass around this night and when I shall see that identification of the blood when I shall see that token I will pass over you and the plag shall not hit it shall not destroy you when I made the land of Egypt praise the Living God so now those that obey the voice did according to what Moses said presented their token and they were saved from the death living so now in this scripture we notice that the things that were done in the Old Testament are perfect Shadows of the things that we are to be in the New Testament the instructions that God gave to the children of Israel in the Old Testament perfect Shadows of the things that we are to come praise the lord we know we see that in the Old Testament in the Garden of Eden when Eve and Adam had committed sin God did not reject them but God identified the lamb for himself he killed this slam what was he looking for he was looking for a token to be applied that when this lamb was killed it died praise the Lord out blood and blood came out of it lost his life into that blood was ight the sin of Adam and his wife were covered and that was the token that God was identifying in their day and when it comes now to the children of Israel when they were in bondage when God wanted to redeem them when God wanted to save when God wanted to change their environment what he did after he had sent the message over and over and Pharaoh had rejected it he now instructed Moses he said I know something that is a part of me that must be identified with by every believer and that was the blood praise the Lord so he told them go and kill the wise Egyptians who could have believed on this message as long as they applied this token they were saved from the plague praise the Lord and now this same message we see that he presents to us this token which is the blood that is coming out of a sacrifice the lamb that has died and that blood much as it was play on the door post as long as it was applied there it was a symbol that God could identify himself with to save whichever houseold hard praise the Living God and now the prophet says about this token it says and God required a token from them this token was an innocent L that he had substituted for death and now when the lamb was killed the blood was to be placed upon the doorpost and on the L and it was to show that the requirement had been carried out praise the Lord that blood that token was a requirement it was to show that the requirement has been apply and says this was going separate and make a difference between those who were going out of Egypt and those who were going to stay in Egypt and perish with Egypt the difference praise the Lord and that's what he was requiring that night to separate the Believers from the unbelievers the believer worshiper was identified with his sacrifice he must apply the blood praise the lord we are laying a foundation for something tonight and it says it wasn't take and kill the lamb set the blood out there somewhere keep it in a charger or take it down to the neighbors he had to apply the blood that's the way it is tonight we could come and sympathize with everything God does that that isn't what he requires you've got to apply it it's not sufficient until you apply it the blood must be applied that shows that you are identified praise the Lord and we see that in the Old Testament when one was convicted of sin praise the Lord there have been given instructions praise the Lord that they go out and get a lamb praise the Lord or get a sacrifice and then bring it before the priest and then the person who was convicted and wanted to reconcile themselves with God they had to lay their hands upon the sacrifice the sacrifice was killed in other words the person had to be identified with the sacrifice praise the Lord said that when blood is coming out unless the sacrifice is losing his life by way of losing its blood and when that blood is applied the sins of the person are covered what was that it was a token praise the Lord it was an instruction that God gave to whoever wanted to be reconciled back to himself we find that Inus verse4 it says and he shall put his hand upon the head of the bur offering and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him and that exactly what we do tonight the prophet says we lay our faith upon the sacrifice which is the word of God which is Jesus Christ praise the Lord and out of him comes the Eternal token of God says what we are doing tonight is to lay our faith upon that sacrifice is to lay our faith upon Jesus Christ praise the Lord which sacrifice was offered for our sins and out of him when he was being offered as a l for sacrifice he was on the cross and blood was dripping out of him when he was losing his life and the blood was being applied and out of that blood came life which is our Eternal token Holy Spirit praise the Lord so the prophet says we simply have to p put our faith upon that Sacrifice by way of believing his words by way of believing the word of God because the word of God is Jesus Christ himself which is the sacrifice that God gave for us that out of him comes eternal life out of him comes the Holy Spirit which is the seal the the day of our Redemption out of Jesus Christ comes the token which we must apply the token of the Holy Spirit now when that day comes the oncoming storm which we know surely shall come we were teaching about it in the morning that there is coming a day when the entire Earth shall burn as an oven praise the Lord and when that day come there is only one thing only one requirement that God demands of us that is the token of the Holy Spirit the life of God in us no matter how much you've listen to No matter how much you believe without that token you shall be left but as long as the token is there when the angel is passing sees the token he says I will pass over you praise the Lord and now this time the angel shall not pass over us to leave us on the Earth but when the Archangel sounds when the Trump of the Lord sounds praise the Lord and now we shall be identified with him why because we have that life the token of God the Holy Spirit praise the Lord that is the requirement that he needs of us that's the requirement that every believing Christian must have in order to enter into the rupture praise the lord we are a blessed person we are blessed people we have all the secrets brought down to us we have all the secrets unto us praise the lord we don't need to go praying and fasting crying and running up and above in order to receive the Holy Spirit it is simply obedience to the words obedience to the word you receive the Holy Spirit and this Holy Spirit in our age is what God is looking out for why because this Holy Spirit comes out of Christ the Lamb of God that was offered for a sacrifice this holy spirit that is our s of redemption this holy spirit that is our protection praise the name of the Living God so now the one who wanted to be reconciled needed a token which was the sacrifice out of which blood came out so now what is the token the token is a symbol that a price has been paid it's a symbol that something has been accomplished the term token is often used to refer to a visible sign or a symbol that represents a deeper spiritual Ser as tangible reminders of God's promises praise the Lord there are tangible reminders praise the Lord of God's promises God his Covenant and his acts of redemption we've seen that in the Garden of Eden in the Garden of Eden he killed a lamb and blood was applied that was a token that was a covenant and we also see that after God had stray the face of the Earth floods praise the Lord that when all was done he still came out and when he looked at at Noah he sympathized with him praise the Lord and He repented to himself and he says I shall never destroy the Earth with floods he did not end there he gave a covenant praise the Lord he gave a token which was the the Lord that each time man an God andever they have committed when God attempts to destroy he remembers his Covenant he remembers his token because he is a God who is faithful to his promises so he gave Noah a token of the symbol which was the physical symbol of the rainbow each time he's annoyed he says I will not when the S appears up there and he looks at it he repents himself and says I will not destroy man that was a conval reality it is a token that God gave praise the Lord and now we see now in the times of of Moses when now he was pulling them out of bondage praise the Lord when was going to Smite the land of Egypt he also identified himself with a token praise the Lord and he put it up there and he was Dy bound to respect his token Duty bound to give respect to his token and now when he saw it because it is the instruction it is the requirement that he needed when he saw it he passed over and he kept his promise prise and now in this our day the token that we have is the Holy Spirit the token that we have is the life of God himself even Jesus Christ and as long as you have that token death has no power over you as long as you have that token sickness has no power over you which is the reality of the Covenant of God which is our protection that token the life of Jesus Christ which came out of his blood when he passed on Calvary praise the Lord he is our protection praise the Living God and the prophet says about the token in the message desperations he says the token is the sign that the blood has been applied that the price has been asked it has been asked required of God then Jesus Paid that price by shedding his own blood did that then from his life came the Holy Spirit and when the blood is applied to you when the blood is applied to you the Holy Spirit is a token that your price is paid that God has received you that is the token remember that is the token praise the Lord then he says then the life that was in Christ is the Holy Ghost not the third person but the same person in the form of the Holy Spirit coming down upon you as a token that your life and your fa is paid you have been accepted and until that token comes you are not permitted praise the Lord he says that token the Holy Spirit it is the Holy Ghost which is the Life of Christ which he gave unto the church the scriptures say all that God was he poured it into Christ and all that Christ he poured it into the church form of the Holy Spirit which is your token to keep you until the day of your Redemption praise the Lord so now a token said is a physical symbol of Covenant between God and his people praise the Lord and we have seen that in the Book of Genesis chter 12 and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for Perpetual Generations I do set my bow in the cloud I do set my b in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and you between me and the earth that is Genesis chter 9 we reading verse 13 now verse 14 says and it shall come to pass and it shall come to pass when I bring a CL over the Earth that the shall be seen in the that's for token to remind God that he has a covenant with man then I will remember my Covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of All Flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood To Destroy All Flesh and the shall be in the cloud and I will look upon it praise the Lord to Moses he said let them apply the blood and when I look at it I will not destroy them pass them praise the Lord and now here to to Noah he says the B shall be in the cloud the boss shall be in the cloud and I will look upon it something God has to identify in order for God to save you he has put something for himself he shall identify praise the Lord that's why he has told Noah that when I look at it I remember the Everlasting Covenant between God and every living creature God said unto Noah this is the token of the Covenant which I have established between me and all the flesh he gave a token of Salvation praise the Lord and He Duty bound to protect that Covenant God is Duty bound to protect every Covenant that he makes with us he is bound to make sure that all the promises he has made come to fulfillment praise the Lord and now the token is also a symbol of God's protection yes sir it is what protects us because the Bible says it is your seal holy spirit is your seal not just your seal until the day of redemption only only waiting for the day of redemption but it's also your seal in other words it's your Shield is your protection so the token that is given to us in our praise the Lord isn't just a physical symbol praise the lord we have seen all the old Testament tokens all the Old Testament tokens which are simply Shadows of what the reality is praise the Lord and we have now seen that ours which is the holy spirit is not simply to be identified on that day alone but it's also our protection praise the lord it's the Holy Spirit which is our atonement which atones before God on our behalf it's the Holy Spirit which protects us and guides us through all storms it's the Holy Spirit the token of God that reminds God of his obligation for the bride it is this token reminds God of his promises for the brid is this toen reminds God praise the Lord of his healing mercies upon us it is this token reminds God to protect us from evil it is this token that guides our fotep it is this token that teaches us the word this token is the holy spirit is the leadership in this age praise the Living God yes sir the token protects you from Wild doctrines for Christ Wars I think in the book of of of Matthew chapter 24 yes we shall have doctrines coming through praise the Lord to Restort the faith which you have received we shall have FSE prophets coming through and the Bible says we shall even have Wes wolves in the bride Church shall pretend to be having sheep says by their Fruit by what they teach you shall be able to know them praise the Lord and it is only the token the holy spirit that points us to them and to identify them and we shall not believe their teachings the holy spirit that protects the word which you have received it's the holy spirit that protects this message from being diluted in your minds in other words this is an assured protection of every believer it is the holy spirit that protects every believer yes there shall be diverting Faith prophets Apostles do is coming through but as long as the token is there when God looks on it is his to protect you we don't stop them from coming praise the Lord yes you don't stop your ears from listening to them you shall listen to them but there is something that gives you the grace to reject every wild Doctrine there is something that gives you the grace only believe on the message of the hour there is something that gives you the grace continue loving the word of God and that's something which we can't explain is the holy spirit of PR which is your token that was given unto us to take us through the T time until the day of our Redemption praise the Lord that is the promise that God has given unto the church praise the name Living God and as long as that token is there you are protected brother as long as that token is there you shall overcome all trials of life as long as that token is there you shall have faith enough to believe that whatever the that the devil has brought around you you have the faith to believe that you shall overcome why because the token is there that keeps reminding God of his Covenant for your life because he gave us a promise that he that started the good work in us it is his duty to take us through to the so that token is there to constantly remind God all those promises for your life praise the Lord that's why he says don't have to worry just believe all things are possible just believe that the token is there with you just believe that God has given you his life and that life must protect you that life must guard you even when the bells of death Are Ringing praise the Lord that hope that comes on the side of you that you shall live beyond that death because you have a life that can never die the holy spirit in you is the eternal life of God praise the Living God and that is the promise the ultimate promise that we have our day then what next why must we cry when things get tough why must we cry in the tent times just apply the token believe and let God do his work just believe there is something that has to remind God yes sir there is your there is your child she's going through a moment and you gave him a promise that you shall protect them and gave them a promise that they simply have to believe you and that you are Duty bound to protect them through all and that when they believe all things are possible now here is your son is your daughter he's been praying to get a job he been praying for deliverance here is your son the Holy Spirit continuously atoning for you the reminding God of his duties for your life that's when God looks down and the Bible says at that time when you at the weakest moment that is when you are strong why because the Holy Spirit which has reminded God to come down to your rescue and when you in your moments of life that's when God raises his hand he says his hand is not shortened that he cannot deliver go has given us that promise and he shall keep that promise praise the name of living yes sir the toen do protect us not only in the spiritual atmospheres but also protects us physically from Evil attacks praise the Lord how do you be able to move praise the Lord the other time I was coming from Cala and then suddenly our it hit from around before get to then we were wondering why it was getting late and we stopped for around 30 minutes and then we were moving together with a certain vehicle in the same and now that overtook Us Praise the Lord and had had we entered M we found the same vehicle that had been moving with us it had been crushed and there were six people in there and only two people survived what was that God had seen that before and he had to protect his life he had protect us that's why he caused the vehicle to break down for a moment never makes any mistakes he is always God so brother if we have anything that we have been praying for anything that we keep wondering why God is not doing this he has a reason why it has not come yet but in his own time he knows that it shall come to pass why he never disappoints his promises he never disappoints his life and you and I have got the life of God which God is not ready to disappoint God is not ready to live his life under afflictions he shall come through praise the Lord the children of Israel they were crying they were crying they were in bondage praise the Lord but when they heard this message that Moses had come they got the Hope praise the Lord that the suffering they were going through was just for a moment that it was a matter of time and they would come out of it in the like manner the suffering of the present times prise the Lord just for a moment they cannot be compared to the glories which are to come praise the Lord the token in that Passover is what God wanted to identify himself praise the Lord God is so much mindful of his life praise the Lord and now the token which we have as the church which we have seen that Christ poured it unto the church God is so mindful to protect it he's not going to lose you brother he's not going to lose any of us he's very kind praise the Lord he's very very kind and compassionate because he is our high priest he's touched by every bit of our infirmities he's touched by every bit of our infirmities pray the Lord all our weaknesses he knows them praise the Lord but still he protects you because you have a part of him you have the Holy Spirit which is his token and he has to keep watch over it praise the Lord and now to us the evening time right we are having a promise just like the children of Israel had a promise we were going to enter into a new land that there was going to be a change of a system praise the Lord that there was going to be a change of system and that the leadership was going to change from the system of pharaoh prise the Lord where there were afflictions where they had to suffer before they could get something to eat where they had to suffer before they could get medical because they had received this promise they were when they received this promise they were expectant praise the Lord and every word that came every word that came to them they believed and did it why because they knew that there was going to come a storm that wouldit the land of Egypt praise the Lord also believe that there is coming a storm and this storm shall hit the face of the Earth Mal has told us the day of the Lord is coming and shall burn it shall burn the enti Earth as an oven praise the Lord and only and only them that have the token shall be able to survive that stor praise the Lord second Peter 3: 10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and El shall melt with fent heat the Earth also and the works that are there in shall be burned up second pet 3:10 the Earth also and the works that are there in shall be burned up verse 11 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought should be in in all holy conversations and godliness looking for and Hasting until the coming of the day of the Lord where in the heaven being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fent heat nevertheless we according to his promise we that have the token of the blood of Jesus Christ we that have received the requirements of God which is the holy spirit look for new heavens and a new Earth where dwelleth righteousness yes the oncoming storm is coming then we who have received the promise of God and are looking Beyond this oncoming we are looking beyond the Judgment of the Earth but you're looking for new heavens and new that is full of righteousness praise the Living God and now let the condition of the children of Israel as we wind up how their condition of Life praise the Lord prior to leaving the land of Egypt now when they received this message they were expecting a change of environment because the message in itself was promising them a land that flows with milk and honey set their souls into expectation and they were expecting any time test of this land they were expecting that any time test of the land that flows with milk and honey praise the Lord and even when they they were being hit praise the Lord as they were carrying the the ls and whatever and they were being smited they could smile because they knew this was coming to pass they they knew that any time they would be changing their environment and the systems would change why because the promise had been given unto them how much more joyful must we be when we go through the Trib times how much more joyful must we be when we go through the trials of life knowing that we have a promise that there is a life that is awaiting us knowing that we have a promise that the Rapture is at hand knowing that we have a promise that Jesus Christ the bridegroom is coming to take us away how much more joyful must we and how much more in expectation the Church of Jesus Christ knowing that Jesus Christ is coming to take them home praise the Lord now these people we are changing environment from suffering Working Day and Night praise the Lord before they could get out to eat remember they operated under a system of operation with the defined leadership of pharaoh and their positions was to be born servants they were slaves praise the Lord but there was coming a change of environment in their lives a change of systems a change of position from this environment of suffering triling Working Day and Night Under the Sun before they could be given something to eat they were were expecting to change from this system ofer of operation praise the Lord they were expecting to change from positions of being born servants children of God Children Of Promise praise the Lord yes they had to tr to survive but they were strangers in that land praise the Lord and if you are a stranger if you a refuge that means you have a land that you own it means you have somewhere that you are destined to be praise the Lord there were strangers and refuges in the land and they were moving onto the Promised Land strangers and refugees here on Earth praise the Lord and yes we T and suffer day and night but we have the expectation that there is a land where we are destined to be we are not destined to be on earth no brother we are destined to be with Christ and we expectation just like a unexpecting mother we know that the day shall come and all the signs are showing that the day is coming when we shall be free from these bodies praise the Lord yes they groomed they were full of afflictions but we are sure of our promise praise the Lord they know that it was it wasn't their Eternal home Egypt wasn't position they hit Moses's message and that's what gave them their Redemption they hit the teachings of Moses and that's what brought their Redemption as long as you listen your messenger as long as you listen the voice that God has sent for your day and you get the instructions right praise the Lord and you believe every word right you must be set into expectation that someday you shall join Christ praise the Lord they hit Moses's message and we confident that was coming a change of system they were in expectation that there was a home that was coming there were bells ringing in their hearts there were bells of Joy ringing in their hearts regardless of the situations they were they were going through there were bells of Joy ringing that the suffering of this time is Just moment and it cannot be compared to that land which we have been promised which flows with milk and honey praise the Lord so now we see a change in the system and God when he had sent this message to not only take the message of the oncoming change of position but also of redemption they were not simply changing from the liberty of pharaoh they were being set to positions of Freedom praise the Lord and his message was clear crossing the people over to the land prepared for that that was the ultimate message of Moses the message has been given to to just to prepare you and to guide you over to the promised land and we are so grateful to God that he has given us the message of Malachi to not just prepare us but the same message shall lead us to the promised land praise the Lord and the message was we are going to the land that God has prepared in other words a predestinated land in which the system of leadership was different was God himself through His prophets that will lead them and it was purely God and only those with faith who believed Moses this message and recognize that Moses was a messenger the voice of God in their day received the grace to cross over because they applied the token and now because there was a change in the system there had to be a thing to define the Believers of that message that was the token of fa praise the Lord and when all was done and regardless of how Pharaoh was refusing to let them go Pharaoh referring the World Systems referring to the World Systems Pharaoh being liken the world Systema the lead of the World Systems full of Oppression the burdens that hold the people into captive PHA the Bens that don't want let the children of of God Escape captivity to change into their positions and take on to positions that God has ordained for them that he loves who are known before the world war Pharaoh referring to all all those burdens of captivity that want to hold us here but I want to bring our notice this evening that regardless of Pharaoh let him be praise the Lord let the captivities be let the burdens be as long as we have the token when the voice of the Lord shall sound these systems shall be broken and there shall be no any force that shall have power sufficient to hold our bodies hold us from being changed regardless of how much far F when the token was applied when the blood was applied and when the angel passed through the children of Israel were redeemed and the forces of pharaoh were broken systems that we are holding them back were broken he let them go praise the Lord he let them go there is no any amount of pressure that can hold us back there is no any amount of power that can hold a Believer when that time has come as long as we have that token praise the lord we got our promise as saints of God that in this rupture in this rupture there shall be a change of bodies praise the Lord and this change is going to be against the operations of the forces of nature the operations of the systems of the world praise the Lord not even the senses of of the body can hold praise the lord we have a promise that when the Trump of God shall sound in the book of First Corinthians chapter 15 verse says now this I said Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inheriting corruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed why because we have the token we have the Seal of God we have the life of God in a moment the twinkling of eyes at the last Trump for the trumpet of the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be rised Incorruptible and we shall be changed yes we shall be changed when the voice of the trumpet shall locate us shall locate the token praise the Lord and verified that the price was paid and the requirement was met the death price was paid and it shall be finished there shall be a force from the inside of us a power of the token that shall cause a sudden change of our bodies which shall be ruptured for this corruptible must put on incorruptible and this moral must put on immortality is a promise and it must come to pass God never fails to fulfill his promises praise the Lord when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this model shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written praise the Lord when you have passed from Death to life when you've crossed onto the other s the Bible says then there shall be made the saying that says death is sold up in Victory praise the Lord Moses when they looked back after God had led them through the the Red Sea and then they looked back and saw the Chariots and the armies of of of pharaoh destroyed the sea the Lord and they remembered how they were being tortured how they were being mistreated praise the Lord and they looked and they saw the mercies of God when we Cross by the other sight we shall look back to our bodies and see how much suffering you've gone through then shall have the power to save death where is your Victory praise the Lord Death where is your vict so up in Victory where is your victory for the token has been applied brother sister the blood was applied at Calvary out of it came the life of Jesus Christ the life of God which is our token given to us freely by faith in the finish work of Calvary praise the Lord and now like Moses's day we have power over death praise the Lord and the scripture has said when that Trump is sounded and we have crossed over we shall ask where is your Victory where is your Victory why you will now know that death has no power over you you will now know all those afflictions have no power over you because on the inside of us is the life of God and the inside of us is the Life of Christ the Holy Spirit which is the token a requirement for every bride in our day praise the lord we got a promise praise the Lord that we shall be changed and brother it's just a moment of time keep the promise of God apply the token hold your faith in the words and let the token be applied which is the only requirement that we have for our we shouldn't be the foolish virgin we should be the wise virgin who have kept their oil who have kept their Spirits burning who have kept their candles Bur have kept their faith unadulterated praise the Lord who have been faithful to the and as long as we obedient to the word God said once you obey his word being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he gives you the Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit is what God shall call out on that day God when the bridegroom came when the when the trumpet was sounded and all the virgins woke up praise the Lord the only thing that could identify them with the bridegroom is the token of the oil which they had that's the only thing that identifies us with the bridegroom the Holy Spirit of promise that keeps us burning

will read the few scriptures in the introduction of the ordinance that we are going into I know you are taught here amen and you know what we are going to do there could be some somebody who is new amen that's why I have to go through a little bit for a foundation before we get into it amen and here it is for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come may the Lord add a blessing upon the reading of the word you may be SE so that's why we we in the Christian Church the true Christian Church Must observe this ordinance of the communion hallelujah or the Lord's Supper it is not only the Lord's Supper why do we say it is communion because there there are other things to be done is foot washing praise the name of the Lord amen it is part of that communion praise the name of the Lord it is not it is to commune between Believers hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord that's why I wanted really to talk about it so that we may not remain into what we were we were Tau in denominations because in the dominations they do it in the morning they can do it in the morning service and they give you C Bread on your tongue you put there your tongue some others hallelujah hallelujah that's you're going to Hallelujah Hallelujah no what does communion what does communion mean in this message communion preached 1962 February fourth hallelujah hallelujah today is what today is what it is by coincidence or what today 4th February I'm quoting from that message preached 1962 Mar Bram amen February 4th he says may the Lord bless his word I want to just for a few minutes speak on communion what does the word communion mean commun means to talk to have communion really means to have fellow yeah praise God you appreciate brother Silas I didn't know you would interpret me because sometimes I'm FAS I know myself but today I was very careful to go with him and I KN he caught up with my speed praise God to have Fellowship to talk with each other hallelujah hallelujah we are talking with him he's talking with us we are talking with one another so we are having Fellowship right if you talk on the phone to someone you carry a conversation there you carry a conversation there you are communing one with another hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and you know how you use those phones of yours you commun you feel it so good even food can cool tea can cool if you on phone a child comes don't you see me I'm on phone that is communion now don't allow anything to disrupt you from the communion with your master hallelujah hallelujah you than God for a prophet he's breaking it down bring it into our usual businesses our usual life hallelujah hallelujah amen and he talks about a phone by then these cell phones I don't know whether they were there 1962 it was the other the the other telephone telephone which you Hallelujah you children have never seen that brother Andrew amen that was the telephone how many saw that Tel oh oh even some you saw it even Henry that telephone heyy then I have some people here praise the name of the Lord you understand understand that right praise the name of the Lord then brother Bram says and if we should come aside and stand back in the back of the building any individual and the pastor or any two people they are communing one with the other praise the name of Lord and this is what we've come praise the name of the Lord so uh with that introduction you know even our families brother Bram talks about it that we ought to bring our families amen this communion by the way is for all ages as long as they are prepared I know you have you have home altars teach your children hallelujah hallelujah the way to go the way of the Lord and when they grow they will never leave it l they get confused in schools where we send them you teach them about communion too those are the basics by the way baptism hallelujah hallelujah that is the first ordinance then communion Hallelujah the Lord supper that is second communion and then foot washing because we see some Pentecostal churches they wash they do the fot washing in the morning they do it they do it and they even now they've introduced even [Music] oil smearing the feet with oil and yet the oil was put was anointed on the head you know many things our children are taught things which are not right praise the name of the Lord so you should bring your children to see was happy for brother William's family Hallelujah he brought all the little ones praise the name of the Lord I think all of you Brethren Amen brother Bram says it is for all ages let me see here he says in this message context uh praise the name of the Lord to stand here and watch the families come in and that's the way it will be one of these days family by Family Rank by rank Group by group one by one when we meet him what a time it will be when all the human life has been upon the Earth that believed in him and trusted him will meet there day won't it be wonderful praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and this message let your light so shine before men he says now we are approaching the table of the Lord oh what appropriate time after seeing many the altar filled the altar filled repenting younger boys younger girls little children aged middleaged teenagers fathers mothers see the coming see them coming accepting Jesus not put it there you've not put it there Hallelujah please put it there so that people may know I'm quoting from the prophet of the day amen L they say it is a new lest they take it a new doctrine it is an old religion praise the name of the Lord Give Me That Old religion hallelujah hallelujah yes sir amen there it is amen ah no no no no no let your lights so before me amen should I give it to you again the altar fied repenting young boys younger girls little children aged middleaged teenagers fathers mothers hallelujah hallelujah amen am see them coming accepting Jesus walking up close to Calvary amen because that they are coming to the table of the Lord praise the name of the Lord so that's what we should be doing amen we come when we know what we are getting to we are coming before the Lord amen that's why we should come humble with humility amen consecrated Apostle Paul says in First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 26 Hallelujah rather verse 23 let us start from 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner oh also he took the cup when he had sapped saying this is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me hallelujah hallelujah then verse 26 which we read is it for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes so that's how important so important it is that it takes us back to think and remember and meditate how he gave himself for a sacrifice so that he may release the token token he released it was he gave his ghost Hallelujah Hallelujah and then when he gave his ghost that Spirit came searching for you seeking for you so that he may seal you in sealing you in him you in him and him in you hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and then verse 27 wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord amen let it sink in your heart you should not take it unworthily should not take it what do we mean by that you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for you to enter into him and for him to enter into you are we together and then your life your life always be conscious of him is he still in me so you must be clean you must be worthy Hallelujah Hallelujah by what I don't see I don't mean that you will not be with any mistake you may have a mistake but if you're a Believer you amen you confess and we pray and sort it out [Music] hello amen but still there is somewhere where brother Bram says see a brother or a sister maybe having come and he saw him or her somewhere in ined in ined hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and you think he's unworthy when you see him or her coming for the Lord again please don't disorganize the service to come and Jack him get him or her out no brother Bram says no because there is a scripture where he says wait for one another yes right then after that go go to that person at his place or her place sit down get the scriptures get the word say I'm sorry if I was wrong brother Bram says so you said I'm sorry if I was wrong but I saw you coming to the Lord's supper and the Bible says that you should not take unworthily but there is some time I saw you in a certain place or at a bar amen but again I saw you at the Lord how about that and then when then you say then brother sister then let us pray you should repent amen and if that person repents that person is a Christian pray together praise the name of the Lord we should not misunderstand and misinterpret scriptures we should be very cautious of that amen we are all we need all we all need Grace and we should not finish Grace for others amen amen now he says verse 28 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup so before you come here examine yourself before you are examined by others are we together Saints I told you I must first give it a foundation then these younger little ones they should know amen praise the name of the Lord I know this church is told this is my church but there could be one or two who are here for the first time praise the name of the Lord so verse 29 for he that eateth and drink drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body hallu you have to examine yourself you say that for the truth I'm not worthy then you remain in prayer and Hallelujah you cry to the Lord amen amen we need you if you are part of the body by the way this proves you are part of the body of Christ communion we said it is communion with one another communion with him we commune with him we commun with one another we need to see you all of you Church all of you that we baptized here we want to see you in the Holy Communion if we see you dodging today you dodge another time you dodge another time will you blame us if we say you a secret sinner I love that amen amen so we are not Sinners here we are children of God you saw you you you you you heard the song I introduced when we are going to to get it and see in US plunge lose all their guilt stains of the Lord you come amen he wants you that's why he came that's why he died that's why he offered himself brother Wilson was showing you that's the token it must be apped praise the name of the Lord amen so verse uh 30 for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep those verses I must I must emphasize them so that you keep remembering them amen they are important for the whole Holy Communion or the communion which we always have as a Christian Church you see this weaknesses this that's why we want you to get the strength and that's why you students before you go back to school

show you what the Lord did amen praise the name of the Lord and I've shown you what Paul was talking about so in Luke chapter 22 the Bible tells us praise the name of the Lord chapter 22 of Luke amen we want to read from verse uh let me see where we can begin from amen verse uh we can read verse 19 to 20 verse 19 and 20 okay but I would have likeed to start from 14 verse 14 up to 20 let me see here praise the name of the Lord Luke 22 verse 14 up to 20 the Bible says and when the hour was come he sat down and the 12 apostles with him and he said to them let me read 15 also and and up to 16 then you will read and and he said unto them with desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not anym eat there of until it will be fulfilled in the kingdom of God amen am mean now look to hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord because this it continues hallelujah hallelujah they will be communing there in heaven in the Kingdom of Heaven There will be there will be that Bridal supper hallelujah hallelujah we shall rejoice we shall commun with him Jesus talks about that and verse 17 says and he took the cup and gave thanks that's why I wanted the bottle here and put it up praise the name of the Lord thank you brother hallelujah hallelujah amen amen the bottle of wine he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it and divide it among yourselves for I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the wine until the kingdom of God shall come then verse 19 and he took bread and gave thanks and break it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this two in remembrance of me you see it is a continuous thing it is a continuous ordinance very special and important he said this do you in remance of me that one is a command it did not say this he may do Hallelujah he said this do you in remembrance of me hallelujah hallelujah and that's why we have to do it as a Christian Church praise the name of the Lord in my church we've not yet started it we want to start it this year because it has been still shaky I'm careful not to not to blunder I wanted them to mature but now they mature amen and I feel we are starting it this year I wanted to begin it on the new year but I was I was away for a convention in in Gaya praise the name of the Lord but we are going to do it one of these days amen praise the name of the Lord this one is not for noin it is [Music] noin thank you praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah yeah that's true praise God amen amen amen so uh this is what it says amen and he say divide it among you do this this do in remembrance of me this do he was emphasizing this do in remembrance of me but I don't him say this birthday celebrate in remembrance of me which is depicting his death hallelujah hallelujah and that is why we would celebrate that more often his death it was for us to get life hallelujah hallelujah and this Brethren it is giving you life although this is a token but it is giving you life you are going to have a different special life hallelujah hallelujah and that what makes a difference between you a True Believer and them who are make Believers like it made a difference in Egypt the token are we together praise the name of the Lord amen so uh verse 20 likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in [Music] my blood which is shed for you hallelujah hallelujah but but that is where I wanted to stop at verse 20 praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord so this is what we are going to do amen we are going for that Lord's supper and then after that I'll read the scriptures which take us into the next stage and that is the foot washing okay I'll read the scripture and maybe get you a quote because we have the messenger we have the message which amplifies for us the scripture the message amplifies brightens expands it for you you know amplifying is expanding making it making it clearer hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so let us get down here amen and pray for the cup pray for the the bread praise the name of the Lord I wish I had the other one
