laying in God's presence in this particular verse the Mother-in-law of Ruth advises her to approach boys a close relative while he's laying down after a day of winnowing barley New Mexico to truly understand this the significance of laying in God's presence we must fast recognize the symbolic meaning of behind this act the symbolic meaning laying down signify a posture again foreign

says come and let us return unto the Lord come out to me that we let him saying for he has turned and he will heal us up after me today after two days will he receive us right that one is that day he
