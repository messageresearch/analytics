name of our Lord Jesus Christ This is a precious morning that God has given unto us to come into His presence all those who are visiting us you're welcome praise the name of the Lord Pastor is not here today he went for the meetings which youth confession that's taking place Youth Camp that's taking place in brother praise the name of the Lord he went to attend it actually praise the name of our Lord so we thank God for what he has done for us and then I would first encourage every one of us if you have a smart and on WhatsApp be part of the Chanel of the church the in Tabernacle we have morning exaltations every day and it's always good to take time listen to this such that you are built praise the name of the Lord we've taken a about I think two or three weeks talking about the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost you know the Holy Ghost being the teacher the Holy Ghost being the seal the Holy Ghost being the Sabbath the Holy Ghost being The comfor Advocate the Holy Ghost now being the token which we have been talking about through this last week and then we want to also take timeing from Wednesday morning to talk about the Holy Ghost as Charity praise the name of the Lord really encourage you take your time and listen to these things because we don't have enough time to teach here at church praise the name of our Lord whereby you take that time maybe picking one scripture and expound on it so you take time and this things will help you you know we are living in days of deception a lot of deception and you know Storms Come and then as if there is no ST storm then again they come and every storm that comes makes some people fall just like in a forest and those who are weak they fall down and then after another season those who are weak they fall down you get it and so there are storms of Doctrine some coming like earthquakes some coming like big storm like those which are making fire burning Los Angeles then some comes you know like fire wind different things and they come you know with a lot of force they take your attention they can sweep you off if you're not careful but none of those things none of those things took alah's attention none of them took El's attention until El had the still Small Voice praise the name of our now just before we continue I didn't plan to say this but I feel I need to read it can put it on the stream brother Bram says he says in the message God keeps his word he says I've went into meetings I want to ask you something if you can put it I want to ask you something fine he says I've went into meetings I want to ask you something you go into a meeting and the pastor Jacks his head then you find the whole congregation jacking their head and watch every one of the Cong Jack their head you go into a meeting you go into a meeting a pastor Jacks his head watch everyone jacking their head you go to a meeting that is a pastor's real wild fire run about and then then you get everybody is running around like the pastor if the pastor jumps everybody starts jumping and then he says you watch every one of congregation catch the same way but you go into a place where a pastor is a solid gospel teacher all hell Will Never Move that church praise the name of our Lord and we want to thank God for our pastor praise the name of our Lord that's our stand a real solid teacher praise the name of the Lord so even if you go those places you know that there's something I'm missing praise the name not just emotions around where people are taking emotions for the baptism of the Holy Ghost until somebody to feel that he filled with the Holy Ghost you have to feel something I got it that is not so praise the name of our Lord but let us be stablished on the word solidly on the word praise the name of our don't move by emotions where we see people in churches run running from behind coming in front and then running back as if the church has become a theater or Stadium no you sit and listen to the word well if you God kind of reveals to you there's nothing wrong with Clapping Your Hand there's nothing wrong with you standing just running running when the preacher is preaching that's disorder praise the name of our Lord you you clap there's nothing wrong with clap you can say Amen thank you Lord but again you can't say Amen throughout amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen what are you listening to them praise the name of so we just need to see that we are established on solid one you know when you listen to the T of brother when the people would rejoice it is a moment and then they stop because they want to hear more praise the name of our Lord so but then you get a spirit gets a hold of us and then somebody no longer listen only one what amen they run around they run around no sit and be Faith praise the name of our so we want to thank God for that and we just want to move by that praise the name of our not the Ws that have come no praise the name of you know those winds come and they sweep many at the end of the day you've moved around run running around comes you have no word in you you fall praise the name of the Lord so we just need to really be careful about praise the name of our Lord so brother said that a church where a pastor is a solid gospel teacher all hell Will Never Move that church praise the name of our Lord but this wins they will be moved praise the name of our Lord but when we stand on the solid word of God we know where we are standing and we can discern what kind of spirit is in our praise the name of I see brother Peter you're welcome Simon you're welcome praise the name of Lord quite a number of activities to do and I pray you'll bear with us we have only one service the name of the Lord so we have dedication of brother emo jong's grandchildren again let sing let them bring them in as the children grandchildren come forward bring them in bring bring them in bring them in from the fs of s breing them in bring them in bring down wondering ones to Jes amen we want to thank God for our brother em is concerned about his second or third generation you know the Bible says I'm forgetting how the scripture puts it but talks about a man who can live his wealth or inheritance for his grandchildren praise the name of many of us look at our children which is good because if you don't take care of your children you may lose your grandchildren and so we need to see that we pass what we believe to our children and our grandchildren and our brother is trying to to bring the children the grandchildren to the Lord now in Matthew chapter 19 and then in verse3 the Bible says then were there brought unto him little children that he put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them but Jesus said Ser little children I forb them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven and he laid his hands on them and departed then so Jesus didn't baptize little children the way we see being done in denomination baptism of small children is not right but the little children are brought to the law and he dedicated them and this what for these little children [Music] amen [Music] sh St let us pray for them Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we dedicate Shalom and Steven your hands we do this father in remembrance of what you have done to and even you told us

return unto thee praise the name of our Lord so today we want to talk about finding favor before God praise the name of the Lord know everybody looks for favor favor at place of work if you are married favor among your inlaws fav in the community where you live you know favor when you get meet strangers so we want to talk about finding favor before God let us stand up and go to Proverbs chapter 3 Proverbs chapter 3 we're reading from verse one okay before we read it us pray again father we thank you again this time we are going to the reading of the word and the preaching of it and you said that the scripture is of no private interpretation we pray therefore that the Holy Spirit may come and search our hearts that Lord you may speak to us that we have need of and bless us father and help us to leave by Your Word In The Name Of The Lord Jesus and this amen prover 3 vers1 up to verse it says my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and for long life and peace shall they add unto thee let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine head so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of and trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thy own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil may God bless of his word you may so verse three the Bible says okay verse for so shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man so we are talking about finding favor before God how do I find favor before God praise the name of a living you know favor is like Grace you know to be acceptable praise the name of our to be acceptable to be received you know the Bible the Bible talks about the children in the marketplace praise the name of Lord and then when we go to Luke chapter 7 and then verse 29 the scripture says and all the people that heard him and the publicans Justified God being baptized with the baptism of John but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counil of God against themselves being not baptized of him now he's talking about when John the Baptist came when John the Baptist came and was preaching the gospel on River Jordan you know people were coming to him from the towns and from all the villages because they heard that God had risen a prophet and then when people were coming to John the sodas came and they said what shall we do then he told them don't falsely accus then when the tax collectors came to him what shall we he said don't ask for more taxes than what is meant to be you know different people are coming they were asking him what shall we do and John was preaching the gospel he was preaching the gospel of repentance the baptism of repentance now when the Pharisees came and the scribes came they asked John who are you praise the name of and the Bible says they rejected the councel of God because they were not baptized of John the bapti and now when they come to the Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord let us go to Matthew okay maybe we leave that we just continue with Luke so when they come to Jesus chist they ask Jesus Christ the Pharisees and the scribes by what power do you do those things you know so they also rejected the councel of when Jesus Jesus now also asked them the baptism of John was it of men or was of God then they said ah wait a little then they go and say let us have a meeting here and then they get into a meeting then they say if we tell him of men there are many people here people know John was a prophet they will St us said what do we do when we tell him it's of God he will ask us why didn't you believe him say what do we do let us go back and tell him we don't know Pharisees and those religious Spirits are still there they don't want to acknowledge the truth but they want to debate with it find what is The Fault in it and then reject it now so now Jesus was telling these people when we continue in the Book of Luke praise the name of the Lord in verse 31 chter 7 verse 31 and the Lord said where then shall I liken men of this generation and what are they like they are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danc we have mourned unto you and you have not wept now you look at this scenario you get fellow children you know it's just like when the children meet and if there's maybe a field somewhere even if it's is not a big field one comes with a ball even if they don't have money to to buy a ball they will make one out of banana fibers and then they would do get maybe make one from poly and then blow inside praise the name of and nowadays there is a lot of policy so you can make men and make a good ball and get a rubber band and tie around and then you bounce it and then you get children playing together but now this is a scenario they go into the market and when they reach into the market they find their friends seated there in the market and start wondering so what they did they get pipes all they get jar and then start playing Amazing Grace house in the sound they start playing the other people don't get moved at all they just there then they start asking we thought he would Rejoice together with us said now maybe they are so sorrowful then they start mourning those they are not m and says this is the kind of generation that we are living in other words there's nothing that can attract someone to get into the Same Spirit of what is taking place so now the Bible has told us that if you obey the word of God you will find favor before God good understanding praise the name of our Lord we have another we can take up here in Genesis chter 4 praise the name of the Lord Genesis chter 4 and then we go to verse three and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel unto his offering but unto Kan and his offering he had no respect and Cain was Roth and his countenance fell now came to the same God that AB was worshiping came to the same God that Adam had but now how he came he brought the Bible says the first fruits of the ground you know he brought mango he brought you know fruits and different things he had the thinking that the original seene was a tree so he brought the mango different things like that just like the religious system of the day they think they ate the lital fruit so that's what Kan was is now propagating and then the Bible says but Abel brought the fings of his and then his sacrifice had the Revelation it was by the blood there was an exchange of blood from a wrong SE that brought sin and then the Bible says that God had respect you know Abels and even his offering God had respect AB even what Abel offered and now we need to look at this that for God to accept us what is the condition of your heart praise the name of our Lord what is the condition of your heart it doesn't matter how much sacrifice you can give it doesn't matter how much worship you can give it doesn't matter what you can offer but the issue is about your heart condition in Psalms 51 praise the name of the Lord 51 and then we read in verse 16 he says for desire not sacrifice brought the sacrifice but he rejected the sacrifice he rejected Cain himself then he said or else I would give it though Delight not in Bur offering then verse 17 the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God you will not despise praise the name of our he says that one God you're not going to reject it if you have a broken heart if you have a broken and contrite and we see that was the condition of he had an evil heart so he was rejected even what was doing was rejected and so we know that when we are living before God make sure that your heart is not evil make sure that your heart is not kind of like a heart living in dishonesty you know and we see the generation that we're living people are too smart they can talk this but their heart is somewhere else they can do this but their heart is somewhere else like the Bible talks about a king in the scriptures here in the book of second chonicles praise the name of our Lord second chonicles and then verse 25 chapter 25 rather verse one and verse two second chonicles 25 verse1 it says Amia was 25 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 2 and9 years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was Johan of Jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord but not with a perfect heart so the Bible says that which was right in the sight of God I don't have anything I've done which is wrong like we can give the same testimony I always come to church is there a fault of coming to church no fault I always pay my tit I pay my offering I make sure that I do that which is right how about your heart praise the name of because that's where the problem is so Amia did which was right when you go to the law and you give a checklist of the law he said this one I have done I worship one God I don't name the name of the Lord in vain I obey my parents I don't steal I don't lie I don't commit a doubt you know I don't C anothers like the Rich Young he was doing that which was right even coming to the Lord what a great the Rich Young to meet the Lord himself and then he talked to him first to face the Bible says he ran and then when he met him he knelt down said good what shall I do can eternal life the Bible says Jesus loved him because he was doing right but now when the Lord told him go and sell all that you have that's where the problem his heart was not right with God and so we should also examine our what is my heart's condition Lord because your heart condition determines your destiny determines what's going to come next on the surface people can see a good person but what is inside the house praise the name of our Lord what is not inside the house so now we see that the lord gave him victory over his enemies around praise the name of the Lord go to verse 13 that same chapter so he went and fought battles and he destroyed his enemies praise the name of our Lord and then the problem came let us read that verse let us start from verse 12 and other 10,000 Left Alive did the children of Israel carry away captive and brought them un the Top of the Rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they were broken in pieces but the soldiers of the army which amazia sent back that they should not go with him to the B fell upon the cities of Judah and Samaria and even bethon and smot 3,000 of them and took much spoil and it came to pass that after amazia had come from Slaughter of the that he brought the gods of the children of sea and set them up for his gods and bought down himself before them and burned incense unto them now you see this St he was doing that which was right in the sight of God sent him to the battle and he fights the battle and is Victorious he destroys those people who are Idol worshipers but again he picks the idols of the people he has Ked and Tak them to his home and then he starts worshiping he did that which was right but not with a perfect heart so at the end of the day his unperfect heart him into idol worship so we need to see that we are careful praise the name of our Lord look at you know Saul look at Saul King SA you know God sent him to fight the Amit and now he doesn't do everything the Lord Has Told heally does What the Lord Has Told he never did the word of God with a perfect heart he never did the word of God a whole heart and then the Bible tells us that the greatest commandment is love the Lord your God with all your hearts all your mind with all your soul loved just halfway the rich loved God just halfway and now when they don't commit themselves entirely to God they give room to the enemy to take a hold of their lives praise the name of the Lord so went and worshiped the idols of the people that he had killed praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says in second coric 25:1 15 wheree the anger of the Lord was kindled against amazia and he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why have th sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand why did you do such a foolish thing you killed these people but then you are picking their Idol to be your God and see that's where the devil gets a hold you know if you are not fully established in the word of God by the spirit of God another Force comes and takes you off praise the name of our so you need to see that you are grounded with all your heart praise the name of know what you have believed be strong on what you have believed don't have doubt on what you have beli don't give room to the devil to come and show you something different and you know the devil likes showing things that look nice you know brother Bram says Hollywood hwood shines so much glamour everything but the gospel blows you know like a light which is just small like this growing that's what the gospel is praise the name of no wonder elah was not moved by those heav things but it was still Small Voice gospel glowing praise the name of our now in the scriptures Proverbs Chapter 11 11 and then we can read from 18 he says the wicked worketh a deceitful work but to him that sth righteousness shall be a sure reward as righteousness tendeth to life so he that pursues evil pursues it to his own death they that are of FR heart are an Abomination to the Lord but such as are upright in their way are his Delight praise the name of the Lord so we need to see that our hearts are not fraud they are not evil praise the name of our see and examine your heart that it's not after things contrary to the word of God otherwise that will be your weak point and that weak point is your strength the devil will just come by the weak area and then he takes a hold of you praise the name of our let us read verse three of Proverbs 11 he says the Integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy and you see all these are condition of the heart he says if you have integrity as an upright person that Integrity in your heart will guide you even in challenging times will challenge you when Temptations come because your heart condition you not look at things the way they appear you will go further before that thing you find out what exactly is this what is behind this thing what is the motive of this thing what are the objectives of so you're not going to fall for anything because you see everybody is running there they are also running there where is your integrity where is your perfectness of the heart praise the name of the Lord and then the Bible says the perverseness of transgressors we still reading in verse the wickedness that they have the one that leads them to destruction and that's what the scripture is telling us praise the name of our Lord and then in verse five the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way your righteousness your heart condition the Bible says shall direct you in your way see Joseph in P's house his righteousness his Integrity could not allow him by the naked's wife do such a thing said we are only alone in the house and then every day she would undress herself until this time she said that she's the one who went to take a hold of him and then he pulled out the clothes and took off these are powers evil powers and now these evil Powers when they come to attack what would they find in your heart if they find in your heart there is no good man of the house which is your faith in the world you will fall by that you will fall but Joseph was able to resist that and so the Bible says the righteousness of the upright shall deliver them but the transgressors shall be taken in their own nness six now so the Bible says in verse six the rightousness of the upright shall deliver them but the transgressors shall be taken in their own nness praise the name of our heart you know a heart which doesn't desire others to have good so you go to a place and you are like H hmon had a you know he woke up in the night when mod in the course of the day refused to OB oy him then the wife said that man you need put him on a g so he made the girl very high that everybody would sit very high and after making it because he was able to make it at night so he in the morning to the king and he want to seek the favor of the king and now the king in the night was troubled and then he went and got the book of Chronicles and read about mod how he saved his life and then he asked the servants what have we done to they said we have done nothing said ah now early in the morning the king said who is there and and her man had gone to seek for Mod's life the wickedness in his made him make a what a tower to kill not knowing that he's going to fall by that so the says when the King was talking to mod what shall we do for a man who the king Delight what shall we do for a man who the king Delights to please and H thought it is me so he said this man was lasting for the throne of the king we put him on the king's White Horse we dress him like a king he get the most honorable Prince around and then he walks in the the city on Main Street and then tell people the king is pleased with this one and then the king told H go and do that to don't fail now you see how his fall started coming so the King goes the H gets everything he had talked about and gets sit on the on the of the king and started declaring this is the man the king is H man man the king is he left that place embarrassed covering his face going home then the wife told him if you have started falling before this I called the Jew sure going to fall when he was still there The Messengers come the king is calling you to the B of and now when they reach the banquet of Esther and the king is kind of you know having a heavy heart he wants to know what does Esther want of me declares we have been sold we have been given over to be destroyed young and old everything then the King was who is this and then she said this hmon here from there was put on his Galls so the Bible has said praise the name of our in verse six but the transgressors shall be taken in their own nness praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that our heart condition is upright before God praise the name of our Lord let us go back to Genesis chter 4 and then verse 6 and the Lord said unto Cain why art th Ro and why is thy continence Fallen if you do well shall you not be accepted and if you do not well sin lies at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and th shall rule over him praise the name of our Lord so he says if you do well you will be accepted praise the name of our Lord and we need to see that from the bottom of our heart we are sincere we are genuine in whatever thing we are doing we are not looking for vain Glory we are not looking for being above others but we are looking to serve the Lord we are seeking to do the will of the Lord something that is acceptable of the Lord the name of our Lord did what that which was wrong but the lord gave him an opportunity do right think right act right Bram says that is our duty to God think right do right praise the name of you know your thoughts let them be acceptable before in in their heart let it be acceptable before don't things like men Pleasers you know at place of work what you are doing is just to please men but then your heart is not in what you you end up doing something wrong your judgment will become wrong because a challenge will come and then will try to find out why would he do this kind of thing why this kind of thing so the unperfect heart will make you make a wrong decision your unperfect heart will make you make a wrong choice praise the name of our Lord but now if your heart is perfect you will be actually inspired to make the right decision because the Lord has been gracious because you have found favor with the Lord because it is God who knows the end from the beginning he knows what is going to happen next now when the Lord when you find favor before God you always do the will of God but now how can you find fav before God let your heart be right before God praise the name of our Lord let your right be acceptable praise the name of our Lord the Bible says in Acts 10 and verse 34 10 and verse4 the scripture says then Peter opened his mouth and said of truth I perceive that God is a respector of no persons Acts 10:34 praise the name of the Lord he says God is a respector of no person but in every nation he that fear Him and work righteous is acceptable with him we want find favor with God how can I find favor with God when I hear the word of God let me obey the word of God let me be you know following the word of God he says he that fears God and work righte in other words to the best of your knowledge you are doing what is right praise the name of our Lord let us get back to our Liv the things that you do the decisions that you make is that the best to your knowledge praise the name of our husband and wife the decisions you make the way you treat one another is that the best to your knowledge praise the name of our your children how you handle them the best to your knowledge or you are doing something to just say let me do because I'm meant to do and not with a perfect heart your heart is not complet like David halfheart allowed AB to come but he said you know he said he can come from those countries but you not come to Jerusalem halfed it brought a problem to the kingdom and sometimes there are also things we do which are meant to be right but not with the whole heart it becomes a problem you know you are taking right but then there is wrong you also accepting with it so you are getting a hybrid becomes a problem and it became a problem to David but the Bible is telling us if we do right praise the name of the Lord it shall be acceptable before God let us go to the Book of Ruth chapter one praise the name of the Lord Ruth chapter 1 and then we read in read in verse let me get the verse here Luke L chapter 1 and then we go to verse 7 wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in-law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah now you see that Naomi had two daughters inw you know he had one Ruth and the other Opera Opera the husbands had died and now to go back to Judah and then he was moving with the two daughters and then he reached along the way and put them to a test praise the name of our Lord Andi said unto her two daughters in the go return each to her mother's house and the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me the Lord grant you that you find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and said return unto your people and say turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands you know she started explaining to them one thing after another said you go back now D said we are going with you then she says I'm no longer going to Mar even if I married and give birth to a son for to marry that son and then Opera said let me go back I'm now free but then the Bible says Ruth cled in other words Opera was doing it with a half heart now when she saw she's going there's no physical benefit this is my opportunity she went back but now when Ruth left to Naomi she went with Naomi into the land of Bethlehem and she was a virtuous woman and now because she desired Naomi and she said your God will be my God where I will die I die left toomi the Bible says Naomi told Ruth go into the Harvest and get some food to do some work and then you see the goodness of God that Ruth was divinely inspired to go into the garden of B praise the name of our and now when she came back from the Harvest with what she was given and then she came to Naomi and then Naomi was asking her where have you gone today she said I went into the garden of boas theni said blessed be the Lord has led you to that F because for us is our K red praise the name of our Lord and there are so many things God allows in our lives that permits a circumstance to happen but this circumstance happening is leading you to your Victory is leading you to your deliverance is leading you to something you least expected praise the name of our so we need to see that we have an upright heart we have a heart that fears God the Lord himself will guide us challenges at the place of you stand upright the Lord knows what he will do in those challenges praise the name of our Lord like now we see the world in its confusion the Bible say the footsteps of the righteous they are ordered of the Lord praise the name of then the Bible says commit all thy ways unto the Lord then he will direct your p praise the name of our Lord on the surface people may despise that thing God has hidden something behind it that he will guide you to that and then when you get into that after some time the on who despised it will find I wish had made that decision and that's how Ruth was so she found favor before until now she was redeemed became her husband and she found peace praise the name of the Lord so we need to see that we find favor before God praise the name of our Lord Noah in his days when it was all evil when it was all Wicked people are doing all the evil things they want to do like the time we are living in the world is so wicked the world is so immoral we need to find favor before God so in Genesis 6 and then verse 5 and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it he repented the Lord that he had made man on Earth and it grieved him at his heart praise the name of the Lord and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the Falls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord praise the name of Lord the Bible says Noah was a just man in his generation what is our condition where we work where we live what is our heart condition prise the name of look at Simeon the Bible says Simeon was a just devote man and then he was looking for the promises of the Lord so every day said Lord thank you for this new day I want to see your Redemption and then the Bible says that the Holy Ghost was upon Simon and when the Holy Ghost was upon Simon the Holy Spirit revealed to Simeon that he will not die until he sees the Lord is Christ now God has given us the promise of our day and the promise of our day is the change of our bodies the promise of our day is a rupture praise the name of our Lord and the Lord who has given us that promise he has come down to us in his word when we believe the word of God obey the word of God the Holy Spirit comes so when you have the spirit of God that same spirit of God praise the name of our assures us that we are part of the promise praise the name of our Lord we are partakers of the Divine prise Praise the name of our Lord now you may start asking how am I sure that I'm going to be in the rupture how am I sure that my body is going to be changed the assurance that I have is that I have the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of our I have the life of Jesus Christ if I have the life of Jesus Christ even if I die I will rise again praise the name of when the rupture happen I will be among them why he has given us his life he has filled us with his holy spirit it is an assurance that we have like Simeon the spirit was upon Him Praise the name of our and the spirit that was upon Simeon when Christ was born that same Spirit Led Simeon where Jesus was praise the name of our Lord there were hundreds of babies who had come for circumcision and the babies almost look alike and those Jews dress alike praise the name of so Simeon didn't go and start asking questions he didn't haveing up the mothers now you Mama you feel for me here also feel there also feel there and then the question was who is the father of this son he didn't do that to find out who had the Virgin birth he didn't do that but the Holy Spirit led him to exactly the and we also have the Holy Spirit that the Holy Spirit the Bible says two will be in the garden one will be taken two will be in the bed one will be taken you will be grinding meal will be taken so the holy spirit in us will be sleeping and the Rapture comes I'll will be taken praise the name of so you are not afraid wherever you will be praise the name of the Lord even if they bury you anywhere or maybe you drown in an ocean or you burn up in flames in air it is it will rise up praise the name of Lord because we have an assurance praise the name of our so now Noah form favor before God when the time was living in was so evil when the time was living in was so wicked praise the name of our and we see we also living in the same evil days where people on their phones they are feeding on dir things and those dir things they are feeding on are destroying them evil thoughts evil evil words they speak and then evil Works they do but now for you have taken your phone and you're not using it to connect to Hell praise the name of for you are using your phone to connect the Throne of God praise the name of reading your Bible hearing the gospel preached at church you know reading the message book you are connecting to the throne of God praise the name of the Lord the wickedness they use this same tool to get inspiration from h that's what happens but then for you you use it connect with the Throne of God praise the name of our Lord that's how Noah lived in his While others were becoming more wicked the bible say that the thoughts of the heart of men was evil continually starts in the morning to see is going to cheat yesterday certain man there I saw a certain woman there and he says he wanted to buy land now how Retreat him then they plan how they canat you and then another is saying ah there is a new girl in the village here now we in town there is a new girl on the Block what should I do the Bible says they were thinking evil continually wakes up in the morning is planning but this girl here she likes this she hangs there then he starts planning in the morning then he says why would I do this if she sells in a shop he'll come as if he's coming to buy something just to throw a word you look nice you're welcome to our town then he goes back then he finds out more but the whole thing is to achieve his wickedness that's what is interested you know we are living in a time that you get ask where are they you know I worked in another one is another is with you know people are just doing funny things and then you ask him what did they eat at night he doesn't know what do they dress he doesn't [Music] know they just business is praning living that's what is happening and then you get foolish girls or women there that manes me you have just seen him and say he loves you there's something wrong in your heart praise the name of our Lord you just see somebody who has just come that one I wish that one I that one praise the name of it is funny it is very funny somebody has just come to church one month two month you want that one to be your wife what's wrong with you praise the name of Lord a brother has just come maybe he's looking better than others and then you try to see how you can make moves to that brother what's wrong with you how much time have you waited on the Lord there's something wrong with your heart praise the name of our Lord you know marriage when you are married is until you die but why do you want to make a decision of many years within one month two months three months to bind yourself to somebody for the rest of your life whom you even don't know you don't know why he left the other church and there are those who are smart they will hide every dot behind them when they come here brother is so good that brother is so nice oh that brother is good sister that sister is good but you don't know what he has covered behind find out what is behind here now I'm not saying try to find out what is behind every person but if you get interested in has come to you find out what is behind yeah what is there behind there because some people are not sincere to declare who they are they not sincere you fall this one I think everything will be okay and now when you start living together you start discovering and your spirit becomes low because you made the wrong decision so the Bible says people's thoughts are evil continually evil and there are some people who are real just like spies you know spy can come and live in your house and you don't know either housekeeper have sent him to pick is a house to find out what you like they take their time until they get their catch but when you are living upright before God he will reveal this kind of f Spirit that's what the Lord does Sons he exposes praise the name of the Lord May pretend to be good but they can't hide when the spirit of God comes and finally the right thing will come out he says only one statement only one word troubles you why has that one say that but then it comes back and then you pray to God then he says that small word is a big package to evil things exposes so we need to see that we live with an upright heart praise the name of our and that's how Noah lived in his until God was saying why have I created man and then God said I'm going to destroy the man that I've have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and theing and the Falls of the air which me why I have made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord praise the name of and we have also found Grace in the eyes God has sent us a message praise the name of let us live the message of the hour while people are just you know living in hunger we have a message from the Lord God has revealed to us the message praise the name of our Lord that when people don't have what to eat God has given us food spiritual food in this season praise the name of our Lord now in the message God keeps his word brother Bram says in paragraph 29 oh oh what started in the C it was hungry children trying to find something to eat now you see when people are hungry they can even eat anything and then he says and if you a bunch of preachers w't give them the gospel they will eat out of aage then he says they will eat out of a garbage can that is right I lay it on you preachers that's right if you won't give the children the bread of life they will take some kind of a scam out of a garbage can that's what's happening that is what is happening praise the name of the Lord where you know church has put the word of God aside and then they are busy on fun things temporary here garbage when you have God you have everything you need but then how will you have that God if you are living in wickedness no doesn't work out praise the name of our Lord so when people are hungry that they even eat dir things they even believe false Doctrine and the Bible says like J and James corrupt mind reprobates we are living in the days of Noah until even you get homosexuals also preaching and they ordaining their ministers yeah they're eating from that and they promote their stuff praise the name of our Lord and you know many things have come up in the time we are living and now when the word of God is taken away from people their lives become Wicked they become evil they rebel against God they cannot have faith in the sound Doctrine and somebody want to think if I don't get excited if I don't get emotional I don't have the Holy Ghost that's not sound doctr praise the name of our Lord so somebody wants to roll how many times now I have the Holy Ghost that's not the proof is the life of Jesus Christ and then you see that there Spirit of emotionalism if you want bitter you go there bitterness praise the name of the Lord you know you find that the devil gets into something and then somebody wants to go by that thing and then you said the other doesn't have the Holy Spirit but that's not the way of God when you receive the word of God and you obey the word of God then the spirit of God comes you don't look for emotions you don't look how much I've jumped around be built on the solid word of God pra the name of our Lord and see the challenges that Noah had but then you bring in the days of lot and you know Sodom we are living in the same days that there's a lot of Darkness around there's a lot of wickedness going on until it has to take the message that God has given unto us to discern the spirits of the time because the devil is always attacking is always coming praise the name of our then how do we find favor with God God has sent us a message take the message of God and believe it with all your heart when you obey the word of God you find favor before God that while the storms are passing God keeps you standing strong praise the name of our Lord in Genesis chter 18 praise the name of our Lord the Bible says in verse one and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he as he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bought himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy s pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and Dr your under the tree praise the name of our Lord Abraham found favor before God until God had Abraham and God did according to what Abed praise the name of our Lord we need to have that kind of personal relationship with God until you were before the Lord I said Lord all this all Lord this all Lord this and then the Lord says what you have said I'm going to do praise the name of the Lord like the children in the marketplace they were just they are seated and then their friends come to them they pipe they never responded then these ones want to take their attention they start mourning they never respond but now when we hear the word of God we need to respond to the word of God by acting it and say Lord I believe that Lord receive that that is mine praise the name of our Lord and then you get that favor of God when brother Bram was giving a testimony about the creation of the squirel and then sister said that is the truth it brought down the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost say what do you want God to do that is Finding Forever before praise the name of Lord where the Lord will ask you want me to do for you praise the name of the Lord we need to find favor and you know Finding favor means that your heart is given to the Lord and you are willing to receive from the when you're willing to receive from the Lord the Lord asks you what shall I do for you praise the name of our Lord and then the Lord after communing with Abraham giving him his promises and says it will come to pass in the time of life Sarah will conceive then Sarah was laughing in the heart say why did Sarah laugh and then Sarah said I didn't lying in the presence of God but the grace of God came down praise the name of our Lord not to destroy her praise the name of our Lord and then when God had finish communion he was walking Abraham was walking with God and the two angels and then the angels went forward to Sodom Abraham started talking with the Lord and then the Lord told Abraham I have come to see what is in Sodom God revealing his secret to them that fear Him Praise the name of our if you fear God God will reveal to you his SEC that's what the Bible says in verse 18 praise the name of our Lord Genesis 18 ver8 the scripture says let us start from verse 17 and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed of for I know him that will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord May bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of Hima the name of Lord God had promised Abraham but the word of God to be fulfilled Abraham had to fear God Abraham had to keep the word of God same thing also with us what does the word of God say in the SC and then you seek the counsel of God you do according to the will of God see the Lord perform his praise the name of so whatever God spoke of Abraham praise the name of our Lord obeyed it and the scripture say when God told Abraham that your seed is just like the sky you know Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righte it's the same thing with us we've had the gospel of Jes we had the message of the hour take it receive it obey it and when you obey it that is righteousness praise the name of our even where you are failing say Lord I believe this is the truth give me the grace to live the life of this world praise the name of our Lord and you yield to the word you allow the world to transform you you allow the word to change your thoughts change your desires change your motives change your attitudes praise the name of our the word purifying you so when you stand to pray the Lord hears you you have found favor before God when Abraham walked with the Lord and then Abraham started interceding for Sodom and and then he saw that the people were not enough reached 10 they are not even 10 and the Bible says when God went to destroy s and God remembered Abraham and when God remembered Abraham he [Music] delivered praise the name of our finding favor with God until the Lord is concerned about what concerns you praise the name of you know like when the Angels were in Sodom they were telling Lord you have anybody here your sonin-law your daughters out that is favor praise the name of our Lord God concerned about your family God concerned about your children God concerned about your parents God concerned about everything that concerns you praise the name of that's why we need to apply the token to all our household praise the name of our Lord to our children to our spouses your husband or your wife you know you need to apply the token that God has given you allow it to reach all your household like RAB praise the name of when she found favor praise the name of and they told her your room is good enough put that Scarlet cloth on the window and get all your parents in all your relatives inever was in that room was under the protection you can see the goodness of God that while all the walls of Jericho are clambering spat that place of Rahab was Secure because there were protected people who had found favor before God praise the name of our Lord the challenges we have at place of one let us have favor before God that the Lord knows the time for you to enter in and even to exit praise the name of the Lord maybe your exit is your safety praise the name of the Lord your neighborhood where you are living in let the favor of God come there and when the favor of God comes no destruction will be there when you are there praise the name of our Lord finding favor before God and the Lord desires us that we do that which is right and acceptable before praise the name of our Lord now in the book of First Kings 8 and then verse 61 the scripture says let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord Our God to walk in his statutes and to keep his Commandments as at this day now it says let your heart be perfect that means that let your heart be whome all your heart praise the name of our Lord that you know you may walk in the of God to keep the Commandments of God praise the name of our let us go to First cor 28 ver9 praise the name of our Lord the scripture says 1 coronal 28:9 the scripture says and though Solomon my son know that the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the Lord searches all hearts and understands all imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek Him He will be found of thee if thou forsake Him He will cast thee off verse 9 first Cor ch ver9 praise the name of the Lord he says walk before God you know with a perfect heart and a willing mind in other words your desire is wor the Lord says God searches all hearts and understands all imagination if you seek Him He will be found of you but if you forsake Him He will C forever so then we need to see that our imagination are right according to the word of a perfect heart a contrite spirit your desires you know it's the mind of God what's the plan of God God want me have to do then you find favor before him because you are doing his way are performing his work because the Bible says the earth and the fullness thereof is the Lord is your body is the Lord is your life is the Lord even your portion of land the even the materials you using to build is the L you don't have anything of your own so now you need to seek the coun of God lord you have made me Reach This Lord you have made me be in this employment Lord you've given me this family Lord you have placed me in this area what will you have me to do praise the name of our you know you are giving God you are having a willing mind you know your heart is opener to the Lord and so the Lord takes over your life because you are there to serve him praise the name of our Lord we have all been created the Bible says for his pleasure for his glory were are created so we go to the Creator that's what brother Bram says you need to go back to God and ask God why have you created me Lord I'm here why have you created me and then you ask him and then God himself he will give you an answer I created you for this I I made you for this in the message God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him brother Bram says and now we find out that his nature was let me jump there say he always gives warning a reminder to we a responsibility we are responsible and God has put us here on Earth for a reason and that reason that he has put us here for we are responsible to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do praise the name of the Lord he has kept you up this time seek the Lord you have raised me this far you have made me reach this age what would you want me to do words you are seeking the will of God you want to make sure you are found doing that which is right and accept before the so David was telling Solomon seek the Lord and seeking the Lord is continu if you have S him today and elected you what you are going to do how you going to do it even tomorrow do the same you are seeking him you want to know the mind of God of God and the more you seek Him the more you find favor before him until he can give a testimony God gives a testimony that there is nobody like so and so he has always sought me to find out what is my will in this issue what does the Lord desire me to do in this praise the name of the Lord now let us go to to First Kings chapter 11 as I try to finish First Kings 11 verse4 the scripture says now Solomon when he got older First Kings 11:4 for it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wife stand away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the that of his father David the Bible says for Solomon went after ath the goddess of the zidonians after milon the abomination of amorites and Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord and went not fully after the Lord as David his father praise the name of our Lord so Solomon turned away from the way of the Lord by his wife from strange lands and the Bible says he never followed with a full heart you know obeying the word of God so he go toing this idoling the other iding other ID you know the wife stand away from the Lord praise the name of so then it became a problem in his kingdom until when reob was a son was King the kingdom was divided praise the name of our Lord his kingdom was divided so now we need to see that we follow the word of God the word of God from the bottom of your heart and if you are speaking to somebody talk from the heart not dodging and finding out I don't know what he's talking about praise the name of the Lord let us go to First Corinthians chapter 4 okay at Second Corinthians chapter 4 I just love that scripture there it says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty and not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscious in the sight of God praise the name of says we have renounced the hidden things of dishonest not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscious [Music] in the sight of God speak the truth from the heart not a pretense you say this you mean this praise the name of Lord like when they say when she says yes she means no when she says no she means a yes then you start a hunting trip around praise the name of Lord when they say no I think now they didn't mean it then you start around persuading here persing here no praise the name in the message to see Jesus he says and so that is the way it is tonight those who desire to see God must come with a perfect heart with all strange feelings set aside with all toward neighbor set aside with all towards the other churches set aside and all other individual and forms of worship you must come with that perfect heart could I see you Lord could I see you Lord take all the superstitions away and I am going to seek tonight to seek the Lord Jesus now I hope that is your intention every one of you and I believe that if you come with that kind of intention God is under obligation to reveal himself to you don't you believe that God is under obligation to reveal himself to you here tonight and you know God is so gracious that if your heart is right if your heart is pure even when you are going into error un knowing the Lord will always stand there to tell you that is wrong like a he was taking Abraham's wife because Abraham said this is my sister and then the Lord came in the night told him you you are as good as dead and then he said Lord how will you punish a righteous people said you have taken a man his wife but the man said his wife sister then the Lord told him because your heart is right that's why I've have come to warn you but now the wicked he just goes with it that's what the Bible say to the wicked [Music] nness leads them to destruction like H the bad heart he had for mod him to destruction praise the name of our Lord so we need that we have Pure Heart upright before the Lord obeying the word of godam says when you come with that kind of intention a perfect heart looking unto the Lord God is under obligation to reveal himself now you find favor you know the will of God you know the mind of God praise the name of our Lord in Psalms 25 praise the name of our Lord Psalms 25 this is my second last scripture Psalms 25 then verse 12 the scripture says what man is it that fears the Lord him shall it teach the way that he shall choose verse 14 The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him and He will show them his Covenant praise the name of our Lord fear the lord he will show his confidence he will reveal to you those hidden things praise the name of our Lord like if you want to marry but then you find a sister or a brother seek the Lord he will reveal more about that but now if your heart is not right with how are you going to see right when yourself you are wrong you can't see right you'll see that which is like you so if you are FR in the heart you get another one like you hey the Bible says they shall deceive and what happens to them they also deceived so you try to hide something behind you you go to God God doesn't answer you like Saul when he went to the there was no answer no answer from the prophets no answer from the dreamers where did he end what the prophet told him to obey is better than sacrifice and then the prophet told him Rebellion is like witchcraft he ended up in witchcraft a spirit and the prophet's word was fulfilled but then if he oby if you did everything according to the word of God would answer him it was always answering David when David would ask that should I go to battle it would answer no don't go will I find these people and then it would answer you'll find but when Saul went there with a fraud heart with bad intentions it was silent and then he went to the witch praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him you'll always not the Covenant of God the Lord will show it to you praise the name of let us finish with second Corin chapter 16 and then verse 9 praise the name of the Lord for the eyes of the Lord run to and fr throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him here in thou Hast done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shall have wars [Music] praise the name of the Lord he says the eyes of the Lord they run to and FL they come in your house they even go to your bedroom they go to your place of work they go to your office they even run in the taxi you are using when you are in eyes of the Lord they run to and FL and the Bible says throughout the Earth they are seeking that person whose heart is perfect toward God now when your heart is perfect in the times of Crisis challenges he comes and proves himself that is with you he comes and shows you exactly what you you find favor before him and you find you are making a decision unconsciously you're doing the right thing praise the name of our Lord because the Lord has chosen you your heart is right before God that's what we need to have all the time places of work have a perfect time at home have a perfect time you are even among the people even strangers have a perfect and then you'll continuously finding favor before God because you're doing that which is acceptable so the Lord is always pleased to reveal himself to you to show himself strong when you are challenged when circumstance you don't understand I don't know what to do in this kind of I don't know what lays ahead the lord always will come down to show himself strong in your life praise the name of have we found favor before God Amen praise the name to know what the lordes of us is it finding favor when you know what the Lord deserves you to do that is favor so you do what the Lord wants you to do and his favor is continuous continuous continuous every day wherever you are you find yourself you are in the favor of the Lord may God bless you Amen Let us sing that
