never heard about the church but they were just drawn and they came for a visit came at the end of service and I had a chance to talk to them and they came last night to the Bible study uh but they were going to come tonight but they called and uh one of the deacons took the call and uh their names are Justin and Felicia Clark but Justin called and said they had a death in the family and requested prayer so they've just come for a visit but they've come because the Lord draw drew them here and I believe it's for a reason amen so I'd like for us to agree together and pray for them as we bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for the privilege you've given us of being here tonight we thank you for drawing us for we know it wasn't we who brought ourselves but it was you who drew us to yourself and God we come with joy in our hearts with the privilege of singing your Praises we're so grateful Lord to come to hear your word for we know Lord that you've given us your true word in this last day and we're feasting from your own hand upon yourself Lord you're giving us portions of yourself to help us to grow into your very likeness and we come every service with expectation with gratitude with Thanksgiving Lord knowing Lord that you're changing us from Glory into Glory you're lifting us Lord word by word into your very presence to your very likeness God you know that this couple Justin and Felicia Clark they've come you've drawn them they came for visit they wanted to be here tonight but Lord there's been a death in the family and Justin asked for prayer Lord and I pray that you would comfort them that you would bless them Lord that you would bless the family and may they be a comfort to the family we don't know how closely related this relative was but we pray God that you'd be a friend that sticketh closer than a brother that you'd be the great comforter that you would send your spirit to give Supernatural comfort and as you begun to draw this couple this family to yourself I pray you would continue the work that you've begun to do do that you would open their hearts to the full truth in this hour that you would transfer them by your life by your spirit Lord and that you would bring them all the way in to the fold all the way to yourself Lord that they would come to that invisible Union in this hour for I believe that's why you began drawing them God I pray you'd help us tonight as we look into your word I pray you would take this vessel under your control may I just relax Lord and may you take over and speak your words of eternal life I pray in Jesus Christ name amen amen God bless you all while we're standing let's take our bibles if we can and let's turn to Isaiah 9 we're going to begin with uh Isaiah 9 and6 I just noticed we had a few guests and uh brother Jordan and sister Rebecca Simonson God bless you it's good to have you together we see Rebecca from time to time but it's a treat to have Jordan here as well so God bless you brother Jordan it's good to have you and uh have them together as a family also brother Vernon and his wife iren here God bless you brother Vernon amen they just arrived in the Lima about two hours ago I think and so Brother Kyle picked them up and they've been with Brother Kyle and his family and so God bless you brother Vernon it's good to have you and we're looking forward to hearing from you on Sunday Lord willing amen Isaiah 9: 6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and the increase of his government shall of increase of his government in peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this amen God bless you as you have your seats amen we're going to look at a couple scriptures right right off the bat here but I just want to uh make mention of a couple things I I want to zero in on this phrase the government shall be upon his shoulders and that's what I want to take for a text for this evening for a subject to preach on the government shall be upon his shoulders amen and so we see that that uh the word government just means the rule just the Authority or the rule it'll be upon his shoulders and we know that means that he'll the shoulders brother B tell tells us is the strongest part of a man meaning he'll bear it upon himself upon his shoulders amen this government shall be this rule shall be upon him and it and it goes through and tells us he'll be the wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace so we know that he came in the form of son amen but as form of son he was called wonderful counselor the Mighty God Amen because it was God in the form of his son counselor the uh the Everlasting father that's one of his titles the Everlasting father why because it was the Everlasting father that took on the form of Flesh Amen to to come down his son for that manifestation for Redemption but the end verse 7 of the increase of his government in peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it so we know that we're looking forward to the coming Millennium when will come and establish the rulership the kingdom upon the Earth amen and and and he'll take the Throne of David David which was promised to him for he is the son of David the Eternal son of David amen that'll keep the Throne of David eternally praise God so I just want to set that all together so we have the right picture as we move forward because I it's going to take a little strange twist because of something brother Benham said not really strange but we're going to take it a little further Matthew let's turn together to Matthew chapter 19 Matthew 19 and verse 4 amen as uh brother Ben had been saying the Abbott family is traveling home right now they should be at the airport right now and they board their flight I think here in an hour or two and fly home and it's been wonderful to have them with us for a few weeks and I really enjoyed the service on Sunday I I really I was blessed and I was encouraged and I began to understand more and I felt like as he was preaching on the lifting of the veil it was explaining my life and I feel like the veil was coming up even higher amen while he was preaching but there was some things he said there that really inspired me I had another thought I thought I'd go to today but I really want to move Amen in this thought uh as he opened that channel and open that door and you'll see how we connect it here in just a minute but Matthew 19:4 says uh and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God ha joined together let not man put us under amen so that's that's a strange verse to follow up the one we just read amen so let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 let's just support it with another strange verse amen Ephesians chapter 5 in Ephesians chapter 5 uh the Apostle Paul starts breaking down the relationship between Christ and his church and between a man and his wife and he comes to verse 30 Ephesians 5:30 and he says for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones amen I I don't don't know how more exact you can get in the language he's not you know with the Apostle Paul I think the reason sometimes I wonder why he uses some language that he uses because you know the scripture is not to just be read like you read in newspaper it's to be pondered over amen it is to let the Lord the Holy Spirit begin to soak it into the depths of your soul and bring a real Revelation we're not to read this like we read a newspaper we're not to read this book like we read other books and he says uh for for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined into his wife and they too shall be one flesh going all the way back to the prophecy in Genesis that was given by Adam which Jesus reinstated and and and uh repeated in the Book of Matthew and then he says this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church amen so now Paul is talking about this relationship between a man and a woman but he telling you this is a great mystery but it actually is reflecting Christ in his church and so we go back to verse 30 says for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones I mean the Apostle Paul could say we are just members of his body are we part of his body but he so wants to he so wants us to get how much we are part of his body that says we are part of his flesh and of his bones he's not saying we're like he say we are amen we're not in a way this is not in a way or this is not in a time he's actually making it an absolute picture that we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones praise be to God and the reason that I wanted to tie that together with Isaiah 9:6 the government shall be upon his shoulders is because brother brandham does Amen we come now to spoken word is the Original Seed and he says no wonder the people were astonished at his Doctrine did you ever read that Mark 1:22 if you want to put it down the people was astonished at his Doctrine because he taught like somebody that had Authority he knowed what he was talking about the church now should have a double portion of the spirit for it is true like Elijah's garment that fell upon Elisha a double portion the same thing came from Jesus Christ now you say oh brother brandham you're talking about his church that's right that's his body because that's what the Bible teaches us that that the church is his body on Earth members of his body of his flesh and of his bones how much much more this is it's not an analogy it's a reality I believe that's why the Apostle Paul went to the Flesh and to the bones to try to show you the reality of this amen not just a metaphor re it's reality amen amen so now he says the church should have a double portion what did he do he took the the scripture by Authority and he didn't speak as the scribes said did in his day he didn't say well it could mean this or it couldn't mean that it might be this and it might be that but no he was the word amen so when he took the word he properly placed the word and he said a church should have a double portion of that amen why because the same spirit is in the church and he's brought in this day the perfect interpretation of the word so we're not afraid amen with the word that he gave us through a prophet we're not afraid to take that word and say this means this and that means that and this is the Fulfillment of that amen amen praise God that's his body and then he goes on to say isn't my wife part of my body and your wife part of your body flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone by holy Union is that right that's the reason a Christian shouldn't be married to a harlot SE that's right not right no sir because it breaks all the things of God you say oh now brother Bon wait a minute you talk about the spirit of Christ being upon the Bible said it would is that right Isaiah 9:6 he said unto us a child is born son is given name Shall be Called counsel Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father and of his kingdom there shall be no end and the government shall be upon his what and the congregation says shoulder that's that's part of his body my that's his body isn't it his shoulders is his body where is the government on Earth at in his body amen he says Saints shall judge the Earth that's right amen Paul said I dare you to go to court with one another and not take before the church that's right Saints shall judge the Earth where is the government going to be upon upon the shoulders his body the government upon his shoulders that's a part of the body what is it his Earthly strength God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body here on Earth bringing it to pass amen amen why and it's amazing he said the government shall be upon his shoulders amen and we know the whole reason because of the strength of the man and and the and the Key of David on his shoulder we there's so many types there but in this day amen God has built up a body and he's connected the body to the what to the head and where does the head sit the head come from Heaven which is the the word that was the back part of God's mind the mystery that God held the thought that he had amen he he brought the full restored word and the full revelation of the word came down in this day as the headship upon the church and where did that head come to rest it rested on the body on the shoulders amen so his government shall be upon his shoulders amen and and that's referring to Jesus Christ absolutely but Christ and his bride are one we've come to the age of Union Oneness restoration fullness we've come to this in full measure it's amazing that in Isaiah 9:7 he goes to the throne of David amen because the Throne of David is his throne but he makes a promise to those in leoda he said and Leo DEA there's a promise to the Overcomer he that overcometh shall sit with me in my throne even as I have overcome and sit with my father in his throne amen and so he's going to take the Throne of David but those who overcome we're going to sit where on his throne as a joint Heir with him in Partnership as one Amen on what Throne the Throne of David So Isaiah 9 and6 it applies to Jesus Christ amen but Jesus Christ has a body on Earth in this day amen it's his bride body amen praise God so many scriptures that we want to look at but we're going to just refer to several of them because we know them well but 1 Corinthians 12:27 says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular in fir in 1 Corinthians 12 let's turn to this one together 1 Corinthians 12 and 12 see as we talk about as brother Simon was saying about the lifting of the veil and the lifting of the veil he was talking about the Veil throughout the ceremony how it can create a little bit of a a a a blurred vision a little bit of a indistinction amen but as the veil lifts amen at the end of the ceremony amen then she can see clearly her bridegroom amen and he tied it together to now we see through a glass Darkly but then we shall see amen and we all know we as known will see face to face amen and and what what we've realized in this day and we've preached it many times because brother brandham showed us that when the bride recognized es what she is amen and and she is a further revelation of Christ she is his body she is his she is his body on this Earth she is a further manifestation a further working amen of Jesus Christ as he works through that body and and so as as it gets clearer and clearer I mean we live in we live in the age where it's getting clearer amen it has to get clearer because there's God to be something that comes to give us the confidence we need to take our position because it's absolutely astounding amen what the Bible is said the position that it's given the believer amen is absolutely astounding where it has placed us amen and through the denominational ages it's been such a hard thing to see it clearly amen what the what the body is and the Believers and who they are amen but in the end time God has sent a prophet to help break through the obscurity and all the cloudy and give us a Clear Vision of this word so that we can see who we are because what we've got to do is we have got to be him on this Earth amen we have to move into that position where we have the confidence amen we can't continually walk in uncertainty we cannot continually walk in this opaqueness this this obscurity this blurred vision where I'm not exactly sure who I am or what I am but we have to know by the word exactly who we are because the the task ahead of us is Monumental amen it's going to take somebody who has bold Faith to be able to take the word and move forward in the word amen and if you don't know which word applies to you and you don't know that that you have a right to it and if you don't know that the responsibility has been placed on you and I amen we'll always be holding back waiting for someone else or something else amen and and we've got to know in this hour exactly Who We Are by the scriptures Amen in 1 Corinthians 12: 12 says for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ I love this language amen I love how exact the Bible is he did not say this is how Christ is or this is like Christ or this is similar to Christ he's saying as our body is made up of many different members as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ so then what is Christ Christ is a many membered body amen and by faith I happen to believe I'm one of those members so what am I part of Amen I can never be all of it in myself that's Antichrist but to make me not part of it is also Antichrist you can get off on one side or you can get off on the other brother Brenham said amen to make me the person of Jesus Christ would be Antichrist amen but to say I'm a messiah or I'm part of it he said now that would be absolutely the truth so you have to see as the body is one but many members and all those members make up one body so all also is Christ if I want to know what Christ is according to the Apostle Paul Christ is a many membered body amen for by one Spirit we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink unto that one spirit for the body is not one member but many amen oh praise be unto God you know it's getting to the place where we have to it's becoming so clear it's becoming shocking yeah amen but I believe it like I know it's true but I think sometimes I shouldn't I shouldn't believe this like I shouldn't be able to say that I shouldn't be able to believe that about myself because I know what I was I know where I've come from I know I'm talking Earthly Journey now anyways cuz I I have another Revelation that precedes this one amen but just in the natural we know what we are we know where we've been we know what we've done and it seems I shouldn't be able to say these things I shouldn't be able to believe these things about myself but I can't help it I believe it when I read it in the word I believe it's true and I believe I'm part of it that's why it's becoming shocking that's why you know get to the place where uh uh we actually become Christ to the world Amen and that's not a farfetched statement that's biblical do you know that when I mean doesn't you take a family you take any family believing family when they go into a restaurant and they go in together and they're in Harmony and unity and they're dressed right and the ladies look like ladies and the men look like gentlemen and and they treat each other good and they all sit around the table and they bow their heads and pray and the parents are conversing with the children and children with the parents they're not all on cell phones they're not being smart elic they're not snipping at one another mom's not yelling at her children because she's got interrupted from her popping bubble game or her Facebook whatever and you understand when somebody sees that picture of a believing family do you know what they just saw they just saw Christ why because it's the word made flesh made manif in that family living as a family unit as a dad in headship a mother in submission he gen caring for her her reverencing him them nurturing and bringing up the children what is it it's the actual Bible in flesh it's the scriptures amen it's the scriptures of how to raise your children it's the scriptures of how to treat each other it's the scriptures of how to conduct yourself it's the scriptures of how to dress and those scriptures took on flash and what those people saw was they saw Jesus Christ sitting around that table because Christ is the anointed one the anointed word for the day sometimes we make it so diff it's not difficult it's the life that you're living it's the Bible that you're reading it's the word that you've received now anointed by the spirit coming back out and that is Christ to the world let's go to Revelations chapter 1 Revelation chapter 1 we know John on the aisle of patmas he's going to get the the the vision here of the seven Church ages I'm going to skip down uh well let's go to verse n and I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in Kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patmas for the the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet and it's skip verse 12 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst that means in the middle in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man I want you to notice the phrase like unto the son of man and keep that in your mind one like unto the son of man clo with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they were burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shining and his strength amen so we we want to go back um to verse 13 and focus on in the midst of the seven candlesticks in the middle the seven candlesticks represent the seven Church ages and in the midst throughout the middle of the seven Church ages is one like unto the son of man amen and we'll look at what the prophet of God tells us all the way back in the message the seven Church ages from 1954 he has this to say about these scriptures he's breaking them down he said now that's the Bible that's what the spirit said candlesticks all right now 13th verse in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like the son of man who what one like him who was this his bride one like him watch How It Was clothed with a garment down to the foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her was washed us from our sins with his own blood all right GED about the paps not a man a woman paps means breast in the Bible G about the paths with a golden girdle the gospel that had the power and glory of God over the body of Christ Oh what a beautiful picture we got here under consideration look at here down to the foot and G about the pth with a golden girdle his head and his hairs was white as wool white as snow righteousness Holiness white speaks of and his eyes like flames of fire looks right through us don't try to hide from him he knows who you are where you are and what you've done yes sir he sees everything we got just a few minutes left to to get to this other Church age if we can and his feet were like fine brass brass is always judgment and he goes down he I'm going to skip down this paragraph he says and his feet was like fine brass as if they had been burned in a fire that's all the draws taken out and his he had a voice the voice of many Waters watch it's the church speaking to him now the voice of many Waters Waters Revelation 17:15 said the waters means thickness and multitudes of people now his voice or his being that was standing there looking like this Christ in his church as the bride and Christ being one like husband and wife is one the church in Christ being molded together with one person the same Holy Spirit and that's the things that Christ did the church does also do you see it that beautiful Church there in Holiness and power and Majesty with seeing visions signs wonders everything just like he did here it is on Earth giving all all praise to God saying I can do any nothing except the father shows me but he shows me and here it is and they come see these things got to take place now Christ molded into one The Voice many Waters many people not just the one it was the whole church the seven churches molded together as one great Ransom body of the Lord the Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian all that's born again with the Holy Ghost speaking with the power of God that's the body that's the body and yet had in his right hand everything in the Bible has meaning in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth goeth a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was like unto the sun shining in his strength and out of his mouth goes the sharp two two-edged sword out of the mouth of this standing there Christ and the church as one brother M now takes us back uh here to Revelation chap 1 and he said this is Christ in his bride amen this is Christ in the church one like unto the son of man amen but it's Christ in his church and we see it culminated in this day in the picture of Christ in the formation of his bride she on Earth is representing all seven Church ages coming to the Head amen we know that when brother Bram preached Christ as the mystery of God revealed he goes to Colossians chapter 1 and he preaches that that that all important verse that we've quoted over and over and will quote over and over and over because it's the day we live in for this to be in manifestation but in Colossians 1:26 he said even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory where is Christ to be where is this great mystery among the Gentiles it's Christ in you the hope of glory what are you you are a member a member of what a member of the body what body you can say church and you can use all kinds of terms but really it's the member of the body of Christ amen and Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet says identified oh the devil is howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word and her alone they don't have this the answer when Jesus came why didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by see he stood alone and his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last day and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and by the power of the Vindicated word promised to her hallelujah what does he mean she is now risen by what by the power of the Vindicated word promised to her she is now risen why because she's seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but she's now risen by the promised word in this day that raised us out of a leody Dean condition raised us up out of Darkness out of misery out of wretchedness out of nakedness out of the apostasy of the lean Church age and brought brought us into his very Presence by the promised word for us amen why did he bring us into his presence so we can say we've come into His presence no he came to unite with us so the headship could come down upon the body so that the government could pee upon his shoulders upon Earth and it could manifest his kingdom in her that's why this came in this hour not so we can say I can believe the message amen we're supposed to believe the message not so we can recognize God sent a prophet supposed to recognize but the whole thing came together to restore a Unity between God and man to restore the the unity between Christ and his bride Amen to bring the invisible Union to bring the wedding to bring the marriage amen so why so that now he's manifesting himself in her on the earth when he was standing there in Revelation 1 remember he was gir about the paps with a golden girdle brother B starts to talk about this and and uh he gets to this in the message the papis vision and I'm going to stop I'm not going to go there yet I'm going to go there next I want to slow down let's go to John 14 John 14 you know I love to go to the scriptures and I love to go to them again and again and again cuz as Paul says is you not believe cunningly devised fables no no you not believe something that some Superstition or something somebody picked up but what we're actually believing is what Paul taught what the apostles taught what Jesus Christ taught we're actually believing the word amen amen it's been held in obscurity and it's been been revealed partially and believed partially through seven Church ages but we've come to the age where it's not to be seen partially it's not to be believed partially but it's to be believed in the fullness of its power and that Faith should manifest into a manifested life amen so that these scriptures become life in John 14:7 and John 14:7 says if you had known me you should have known my father also and from hence forth you know him and have seen him Philip sayi un the Lord show us the father and it suffices us Jesus already told him if he already told them if you had known me you should have known my father amen from henceforth you known him and you have seen him Jesus tell him Philip you've seen him and Philip says uh I haven't seen anything yet show him to me Jesus said unto him have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me Phillip he that has seen me ha seen the father and how sayest thou show us the father how can you say show us the father I've been showing you the Father the whole time amen the father's the one in me he's the one doing the works me he's the one fulfilling the word in me how can you ask me to show you the father I've been showing you the father verse 10 believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works amen oh I I just love that amen he says you know uh he says now you've seen the father Philip says um show him to us you know when we walk through this world not of our own thinking but we've surrendered our thinking to the word and we walk in this world obedient to the word and our actions and our conduct amen and the fact that we we get up on Sunday morning and all our neighbors see us come out with nice clothes on going to they know you're going to church they see your Bible they see the way you're dressed what are you doing you're showing the word amen amen amen when you when when you the way you conduct yourself the way we act at work the way we act at school the way we act when we're out amen the conversations we have everything we do when it's structured by the word amen it's no longer me but it's Christ in me amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's now fleshing out his word in my flesh and now amen what are we doing we're showing Christ am we're showing Christ to the people amen and it's saying you could you could say Amen show me Christ and been like I've been showing him to you all along have you not been noticing amen this is Christ this is the word this is the anointed word on display right before your eyes and you say I want to see Christ you're seeing Christ amen you're seeing the word on display day in and day out this is why the life we livees matters so much amen we can't just go out and continue living our life according to our thinking that's why we die to ourselves and die to our thinking amen that's why when when Simon was talking about the union that takes place in a marriage amen when that turn when they turn around and walk out that girl now has a new identification she has a new name and now her actions amen reflect on her headship which is her husband now because brother benam told us amen that the kind of woman that a man choose will show what character character he has inside and what he's thinking of his future home what he is on inside is reflected so as she goes out bearing his name now Goes Forth as Mrs Jesus Christ amen she's going out walking back out of the ceremony bearing his name and displaying his name in female form Amen to the world and they can get an honest opinion of that man come on now by looking at the woman who's bearing his name that's why the whole scripture amen of headp and and submission is so important because we as Believers if we ruin this picture amen and a woman will not come under her husband's headship and she wants to dictate and run the home you get everything flipped upside down and now you're not showing Christ to the world Amen because he's not bearing her name she's bearing his name amen so now Jesus came in his father's name is that right he was bearing his father's name and what name did the father take he had many titles but he only took one Earthly name when he came in flesh he took the name Jesus Christ amen and he was bearing his father's name and he was showing the father to the people because it was the father's life inside of him he was living the Commandments of of the Lord he was living out the Commandments of the word the Commandments of his father and so doing that he was showing the father Amen brother B tells us the word tells us the scripture tells us God is the word Christ is the anointed word the word for our day Christ is the word God is the word and he said and we are the word amen so we become the word as we let the word flow through usen and so as that life in US amen changes our life and brings our life subject to his life and begins to live his life through our life amen now we're displaying to the world not our life we're displaying to the world his life because before I came to him I had a different thing I projected to the world I projected all kinds of selfishness and foolish Notions and childishness and and and and self-love and all kinds of lewdness and crudeness and all these things I projected that was me amen but there was come a time that I had to die to me and I had to take his name and now he has to live in me and he's projecting something totally different he's projecting submission amen surrender love and harmony with others he's he's projecting something completely different and now we're showing him to the world all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church verse 18 John 14:18 this is the same chapter this is the same discourse that he just talked about uh you've seen the father and Philip askes show us the father he's in the same conversation with his disciples in verse 18 he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you he's speaking of the comforter coming he's speaking of the Holy Ghost coming the spirit of God but what's he saying he's making it personal he's not just saying now I will send you the Comfort he's saying no I will come to you the comforter that he sends is he himself am I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also amen at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you now show us Christ amen amen when brother Brenham came to this scripture says at that day he said that's this day amen at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you so where is Christ he's in his body that's this day now let's look at verse uh 21 same same portion of scripture here says he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas saith unto him not as scariot Lord how is it that thou wil manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him how are you going to reveal yourself to us and not the world how is this going to be a private Revelation how will you reveal yourself how will you come to me how will you reveal yourself to me and not to the world he brother Jesus makes it so simple he says he that keepeth my Commandments have my Commandments to keep them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him manifest myself to him then he asked the question and Jesus answered if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we so where's the father same place Christ is and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him amen where's he at in his body let's go to First John 1 John chapter 4 1 John chapter 4 verse one said beloved believeth not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know you the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist where if you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world so the Antichrist spirit amen is not just some man the Antichrist spirit will be incarnated in a man at some point but the Antichrist spirit is the spirit that resist the truth that Jesus Christ is come in flesh is currently present tense come in the flesh that's the Antichrist spirit and that's why the world is full of the Antichrist spirit and religion is full of the Antichrist Spirit looking for an antichrist to come and not realizing they're right I'm in the Antichrist and fleshing out the Antichrist because the Antichrist spirit is denying that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh the Antichrist spirit is denying that Christ is here in Bride form that's an antichrist spirit so that that Spirit we resist and now we can judge that spirit because it denies the truth of Christ why is it an antichrist because it's against Christ what Christ Is it against this scripture tells us it's not against the Christ that was nailed to the cross at Calvary this Antichrist spirit is against Christ what makes it against Christ it's against the present tense place of Christ and that's what makes it Antichrist it's not against what Christ did in the past it's you can tell the Antichrist spirit because it's against what Christ is doing now right amen so now we we've went through all of that now I want to back up and I want to start talking back about Revelation chapter 1 again now he he was one in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks is one like unto the son of man and he's G about the paths amen and brother B's going to refer to this and when he preaches the patmas vision in 1960 so now let's watch him just a little further as we take the rest of the 13th verse and in the midst that's the middle of the golden candlesticks one like the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle now here's more proof that this Doctrine is right about it being the Lord's day this this picture emerges in the Lord's day amen did you notice him he was not a priest during this time neither was he a king he was a judge so he was in between priest and King amen he was in between mediation and the Throne of David amen maybe he had come as the white wigged one the Supreme deity the judge of all heavens and earth this is the Lord Lord's day amen see do you notice he's not a priest during this time neither is he a king he was a judge notice a priest a high priest then he went into the sanctuary or went in to minister to service he tied himself around the waist tying his girdle around the waist meant that he was serving never tied it over his shoulder but here he comes out walking out with the girdle tied around the top with a sash over his shoulder girded about the paths the breast with a golden girdle gted up high what is it an attorney a judge the judge with the sash over his shoulder where's it at now over the shoulder where's the shoulder it's part of the body where's the body it's on Earth yeah where did the headship come amen when he come as the white wigged one the judge of all heavens and earth when he comes as judge he that that headship came to sit where it came to sit upon the body and now the picture in Revelation one brother said is the Lord's day amen between priest and between King amen sash over his shoulder gted up here not down a priest shows he wasn't in his priesthood now John went all the way over into the Lord's day and saw him coming as judge you believe he's a judge let's just read John 5:22 right quick we'll see whether he's judged or not John 5:22 for the father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the son amen so his throne will be a throne of judgment the question is who sits on the throne with him amen the one who is one flesh the one who is member of his body of his flesh and of his bones a joint air United together sitting on his throne know you not that you shall judge the world it's only fitting that as he merges into his church he merges in the in the end time in the Lord's day as a judg with the girdle heard about the paps the breast amen with the sash over his [Music] shoulders amen amen that's right he is the judge the Supreme judge and John knows that he wasn't in the day of his prophecy as a prophet neither was he Plum out in the days of his kingship but he was in the day of the Lord as a judge so here he is in between two dispensations priest and King comes as a judge you know we're in the time of judgment yes amen do you know that we're we're we're we're currently under the dispensation of the six seal it's not open in full Fury it can't as long as the bride's here amen CU as long as the spirit's here is holding back the full wrath amen but we're in that period of the judgments of God it's why brother B after he preached the seals took a stone and threw it in the air amen it started Ro he said judgment striking the West Coast there's a series of judgments that's been striking and Rippling through the Earth ever since there's wars and rumors of wars and pestilence and fearful sights and all kinds of the things that are promised to happen are here but it can't fully unleash as long as the bride's here and it's not just because of your flesh it's because what you represent because the life of God is in you the holy spirit is here but he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way amen he goes on in the church age book he goes through the same section patmas Vision in the church age book now and listen to what he says he quotes the same scripture Revelation 13 He says there he stands one like unto the son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so is he glorified in the midst of the churches where's he at he's in his church amen that's where this jewel is it is the Lord's day for John sees him standing not as a priest but is the coming coming judge the golden girdle is no longer gird around the waist where the priest must wear it as the minister to God and the holiest place but is now around his shoulders for he is not now the priest but the judge amen it's interesting that in this time I want to I want to finish these last few minutes by just talking about in this time where we're in between priest and King we've had Son of God we have son of man Son of God and then we have son of David but injected between Son of God and Son of David is son of man again and that's the prophetic and we know God we saw the son of man Ministry we saw a son of man revealing the son of man that was Jesus Christ the son of man had returned and was working through a son of man that Prophet amen but that son of man didn't leave the Earth when the prophet left the Earth he because that that a son of man was there to unite The Head and the body together in the wedding Amen to do what to reproduce the son of man again so now that dispensation is in Bride form in between Son of God and Son of David in between priest and judge or and King Amen in the time of Judge and you say then then all of a sudden we have to think oh my goodness you think now now if that's the case if there's a unification here if the white wigged one has descended and come down the Supreme judge of all Heaven and Earth looking down with eyes of judgment and he's come to unite with the body and now the sash is about the girdles about the breast and sash over the shoulders we see this dispensational change we say if we're in judgment is there no more Mercy on that's always the question but I'll tell you this there's only one person that can ever extend Mercy the only person in all of our governments that can extend Mercy is the judge the only place to get Mercy is at the Judgment seat you don't get Mercy anywhere else but at the Judgment seat because the Judgment seat is The Mercy Seat and then the Judgment seat becomes The Mercy Seat when when the blood which is the life is upon the Judgment seat it becomes a mercy seat so what did the blood represent it represented the life what is the life the life is the life of Jesus Christ where is it it's in the church it's upon the Judgment seat making it a mercy seat cuz you can only get Mercy at a judgment seat if you say hey I've committed this crime and I've done this and I've done that you've got to go before some judge somewhere to get acquitted of that to have mercy there's got to be somebody that'll be that has the right to judge and that person with the right to judge is the only one that has the right to give Mercy the police officer can't give you Mercy the one who arrested you the one who keeps you in jail none of them can give you Mercy only at the Judgment seat can you find Mercy praise God Amen why did he move from priesthood and the judge because he's no longer covering for the sins of ignorance through the church ages he's brought the fullness of the word now the fullness of the word is available he's not covering for sins of ignorance now he's now he's here as a judge but he's still offering Mercy to those who can come to [Music] it where's he at the head and the body has United in between priest and King I'm happy to be here this day you know what I don't see myself on Earth I take this back I was going to say I don't see myself on Earth as a judge but I do because if you want to give Mercy you have to be the judge that's right but I don't see myself here for condemnation I see myself here for Mercy I see my role that I'm playing out here not condemnation but Mercy but when mercy is spurned what happens when mercy is spurned when mercy spurn there's nothing left but judgment so I don't see my existence I'm not walking around saying lightning bolts lightning bolts fire and brimstone I don't see myself in my role that's not what I'm here for I'm here because there's an opportunity while Christ is here while the blood is here while life is here before the full unleashing of the six steel and the tribulation period when there's no change in your condition while I'm here while we we are present while the spirit of God is here in me I see myself as a place of Mercy not a place of judgment amen I shouldn't say not a place of judgment it is a place of judgment not a place of [Music] condemnation you know what a privilege it is to be a judge who can give mercy God Amen you don't always have to give condemnation doesn't always have to be the worst praise God Amen let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new amen amen and all things are of God who ha reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and ha given to us the ministry of reconciliation oh I believe we have that Ministry friends to Wi that God was in Christ oh this is so good God was in Christ what was God doing when he was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation as God was in Christ Christ is in US all that God was he pour into Christ all that Christ was he pour into us what was God doing in Christ he was reconciling them to himself not imputing unto them their trespasses he was giving them an opportunity what is Christ doing in us the same thing Amen to Wi that God was in Christ reconciling the world and to himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and ha committed unto us the word of reconciliation now now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us he saying we're Ambassador Christ meaning we're here as if God is talking to you and imploring You by us he's using my mouth he's using my body but it's God beseeching you we pray you in Christ dead what's he saying we pray you in Christ dead that means in the place of or instead of or for Christ we are here representing in Christ we pray you in Christ dead be ye reconciled to God what's the ministry of the Bride this is the ministry of the Bride this was the ministry of the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul Goes Forth with this ministry he's got the word of reconciliation as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself now we are beseeching you as if God was beseeching You by us God's talking to you by us we're here in Christ dead imploring you to be reconciled to God is that was Paul's Ministry and if you heeded Paul's word what happened when you listened to Paul's word believed it heed it you were reconciled to God what happened if you rejected Paul's word when Paul and Barnabas amen when they went down into a city they preached and they were the whole city was hearing them gladly amen but then all of a sudden amen the Jews stirred up they made counsel and stirred up the the Jews and The Devout Gentile women and they came against him and he says it's meat it's proper amen that the gospel should have been first preached to you seeing that you're Jews but seeing that you count yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life what is Paul Paul is standing there he is a judgment seat and a mercy seats not because of his flesh because he has the gospel he has the word amen Paul had the word for his day he had the word of reconciliation he had the ministry of reconciliation he was beseeching them as if he was God he was in Christ dead and when they rejected that right they rejected God Amen when mercy is spurned there's nothing left but condemnation we are not here to condemn Jesus didn't come to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved but he said he that believeth not is condemned already yeah they're already condemned they were already condemned so he didn't come to condemn because they're already condemned this world is already condemned friends it's going to burn not because I said so because it's already destined they've already rejected the gospel they've already turned their back on God the denominations have all kicked him out amen he's outside yeah the denominations they're already condemned they've already rejected God they've already turned their back on the word so I have not come into the world to condemn the world I've come into the world that the world might be saved why are you here why are you here as part of the body of Jesus Christ not to condemn the world but that the world Amen through Christ in you might be saved what happens when that Mercy is spurned there's nothing left but condemnation why because they're already condemned in the message adoption 1960 then if God has sent us to be his ambassadors all power that's in heaven all that God is all of his angels and all of his power stands behind our words if we are correctly an ordained sent Messenger to the people God has to honor the word for he has so solemnly written that whatever you bind on Earth will be B bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth will loose in heaven and I give unto thee the keys to the kingdom all such great promises he given to the church he's promised amen when when when Peter amen when Peter said they asked Jesus asked who say you that I am in in Matthew 16 he says Thou Are Christ the son of the Living God he says blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood is not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail and I give unto you the Keys of the Kingdom whatsoever you bind on Earth will be bound whatsoever you loose on Earth will be loosed and that power has been with the Living Church amen that's on the found foundation of the revelation of Jesus Christ and the revelation of Jesus Christ present tense is the inoculation against the Antichrist Spirit and the Antichrist spirit is against this Revelation am has been in every age has been in every dispensation is the same [Music] today so then brother B said doesn't the church have power to forgive sins doesn't have power to bind the church have power to loose and brother Benham said said that's correct he was questioned on that by a Catholic am he said but not the way the Catholic Church does it they go to the priest and the priest says I make you free do hail marage do this pent this that's not it he said how did they do it they said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and that's how their sins were remitted that's how they were loose why what were they doing they were giving them the true word the gospel which is Jesus Christ Christ the anointed word for the day and when they gave them the word those that took it were loosed and freed from their sins those that rejected it stayed Bound in their sin they were already condemned they stayed condemned amen but there were some who were loosed Hallelujah am how will they be loosed in this day amen because we have the word of reconciliation we have the ministry of reconciliation we have been given the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication we know our day and its message this message is Christ brother said the message is Christ it's not an addition to Christ it's not plus Christ it's not a bonus Christ this message is Christ praise be to God brother B says in the fourth seal said if God speaks and sends you he backs up what you say this is what we have to recognize Who We Are amen if God speaks and sends you he backs up what you say see notice if you an ambassador from Heaven All Heavens behind you and Heaven is consisted of the word so if you're speaking the word all the word is behind you all the power of the word is behind you not when you take your own idea not when you take your own but when you have the word brother B I'm going to read two quotes together as we close close here yeah we're very close and the message Christ is revealed in his own word he says see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it came out through the feet Luther come back out through Wesley then it come to Pentecost the tongues and the lips see now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that so what comes after Malachi 4 him himself to step into that into what praise God because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his what is that the headship the word that has come amen we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's God himself it's becoming to a place he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride praise God then all the way down through but the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning praise God then in choosing of a bride he says the other he says the one Church the false church is pregnated with the false word and bring forth the Antichrist one day he said the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride hallelujah amen as you are a member but you your body is one but many members many members make up one body so also is Christ and the word those who are pregnated with the word of God will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one in Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word I believe that what has he given us his word if we have his word perfectly interpreted for our day we have his will am how do you know it's his will because it's the perfect interpretation of his word his word is his will and that's what directs us amen amen that's what guides us that's the head listen that is the head guiding the body amen that's right the end time revelation of this word being lived by the body is the head directing the body prise God the paman church age from the Church age book he says this this is in pick up your pen and write brother Simon referred to it said those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still n though they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride amen where is he working in and through the bride at the end time if he comes as judge in between priest and King where will he work in and through the bride when the white wiwin comes down as the Supreme judge of all Heaven and Earth where will he go to the body which is the bride where will he administer his office through the bride cuz he did not finish all his work in his Earthly Ministry now he finishes he completes it in and through the bride she knows that that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time he left the work for today and he's going to do it through you and I so he has to have a complete body to finish the complete work the work that he didn't complete in his first Earthly Journey now he's going to do it in through the bride so he must complete the body to complete the work that's the day you and I live in this is today I want to close with two scriptures just to solidify what we've been saying in Matthew chapter 10 Matthew chapter 10 verse 11 Jesus sent his sending out his disciples to preach the Good Tidings of the Kingdom that's what he sent them to preach that the Messiah is here that the promise is being unfold he sent them to preach Good Tidings of the kingdom it says into whatsoever city or town you shall enter inquire who is it is worthy and there till you go hence then and when you come into a house salute it and if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when you depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet verily I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for that land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that City let's go down to verse 40 same same chapter chapter 10 verse 40 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward he sent them out to preach Good Tidings of the Kingdom he sent them out to preach present tense truth he sent them out to preach the gospel but he said wherever you go salute it and put your peace upon it if they're worthy let your peace remain but if they're unworthy if they won't receive the word if they'll reject it then let your peace come back to you and as you go out shake off the dust it'll be more tolerable for Sodom and gomorah in the day of judgment than that he didn't send them out there and say go condemn and go chat no go bring a message of peace and if they don't receive it then your peace will return unto you and shake off the dust and go on that sealed their Doom they were ambassadors ambassadors of the Gospel ambassadors for peace but when they were rejected they rejected peace and life yeah and Jesus said if they receive you they receive me they receive me they receive him that sent me what if they reject you what happens when they rejected the disciples then he goes on and it's amazing where he goes next if they receive you they'll receive me if they receive me they received him that sent me he that receive a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward he that receive a righteous man and he's going down by strata he will receive a prophet will receive a prophet's reward which is a whole host of Heaven the word he that received a righteous man now he's went from Prophet just to a righteous man but receive a righteous man's reward which is life and then he goes down lower but he that will give a cup of cold water to one only in the name of a disciple so he just gives it to just one of the disciples doesn't have an office not a prophet not but he that'll give a cup of cold water in one in the name of a disciple shall in no wise lose his reward the same ones that went out with the same message there are those that receive judgment because they rejected it there are those that receive life even all the way down to reward for someone who just gives them a cup of cold water and the name of a disciple the question is what are you here for what are you here for in the day of judgment under the Sixth Seal with the Earth trembling under the impact of The Sixth Seal ready to burst forth amen with with the Christ on the outside with judgments rolling beneath the Earth amen reading to belch out amen with the full wrath of God about to unleash what are you here for why has why has the white wigged one come down and United with this body and this dispensation why are you here don't don't say bride you ask yourself why am I here why why am I on this Earth what am I doing in this dispensation when judgment's all around amen I want to go with a word of reconciliation with a Ministry of reconciliation not to condemn the world but the world might be saved if they'll just receive the Christ that I'm bringing to them if they'll just receive the word amen they'll be saved that's why I believe I'm here not here to condemn the world's already condemned but I'm here that somebody might have life I'm here to to spread the word sometimes through my lips mostly through my actions but I'm here to live the word I'm here to be the word I'm here to be amen one member but that member's part of the body of Christ amen so I'm here to represent Christ to the world that when I come in contact I want my peace to go into that house amen and I don't want my peace to come back to me I want it to stay there amen I want somebody if they can't receive a prophet they can't receive a righteous man if they could at least give a cup of cold water to one who is just a disciple at least there'll be a reward amen for that why because she is him amen that's the dispensation we're in today that's why I believe that God has placed me on the earth in this day he's placed me here for Mercy he's placed me here for life because the world is already condemned that's why when he takes his bride away and the spirit goes up when the bride goes up there's nothing here to hold back the Wrath but while she's here the blood is here right because brother Brenham said now you see why brother Brenham said the church is is the blood by the spirit amen because the blood represented the life and the life of Christ is here in his body in his bride and as long as the life is here there's a mercy seat here as long as the life is here there's a chance for life but once the life goes no more chance amen I'm not I'm not looking forward to that I want reconciliation let's all stand Amen brother Ben if you can make your way up and musicians if you could come let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for this word lord it's beyond us Lord when we think humanly when we think finite Minds when we think just intellectually this is so beyond us lord it's so beyond our capabilities it's beyond our thinking it's beyond the reality we've known as a three-dimensional reality but God when we go deeper than that when we go to the soul lord we know that this is nothing but the truth God I pray that you help me so live this word that it'll be life to somebody let me display your life on this Earth forgive me Lord for compromise forgive me for taking my own ideas forgive me for my spiritual laziness Lord I Repent Lord at your feet and I pray you would suck it all out of me Lord and put more of your spirit in me take more controlled as I die out take more residence in me Lord that you might reach through my hand to lift someone else up that you might speak through my lips a word of reconciliation that you might Minister through me a Ministry of reconciliation May there be Mercy May there be life may there be rewards that are given Lord because I'm here and I'm present and let my peace go out the your peace that's going through me May it fall on many Lord may they receive it that's our prayer help us God to engage help us God to Live help us God to love help us God to minister God we want to surrender ourselves to your hand that you might finish the work that you've left for this day that you might finish it through US Lord and may there be Mercy granted to many because we were here may there be rewards given to numerous individuals because we were here here and because we represented you and because you were in us may there
