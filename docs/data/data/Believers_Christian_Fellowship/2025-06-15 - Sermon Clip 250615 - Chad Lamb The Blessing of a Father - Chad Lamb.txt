========================================

You ever had a conversation, a a man and his wife had a conversation, child's done something, they need discipline, and who is it that's always advocating for the child? Well, they didn't mean to. And and they've they're overly tired and they and and and maybe just not this time. Is that only in my house or does that happen anywhere else? That's the proper role of a mother. But you see how if that's the only role that you have, how there's never any character building in that child because it takes a father, amen, to say, "No, th this is for their good. This is what they need." The same thing happens in a church when you get into situations that are violations of the word. You take for instance, amen, qualifications for ministry, who can marry, who can not marry, who's eligible, divorce, and all of a sudden you say, "Well, I feel sorry for them because their situation and this happened to them." And you don't know how bad their husband treated them and now they're all alone and they're so lonely. I feel for them. That is the role that you should play as a mother, right? I feel for you. I love you. This is hard for you and I'm here to support you and take care of you. But the moment you start to try to deviate from the word and say, "I think in your circumstance or in this situation, we'll let it go." The moment that happens, the church has just cut the father out of the scene and she becomes a doineering woman and she's taken her mercy and love and she's done damage to the very objects of her love by what? By circumventing the word of the father. Amen. For what? For compassion and sympathy. This is what's happened to the worldly church. God forbid it would ever happen to us. Amen. Because the church, it doesn't matter what names on the sign, it doesn't matter how much you like the people that gather gather together, the church can never give you your identification. And if you're looking for the church for identification, you're always going to be struggling with identity. Yeah. But oh, if that mother could just say, "This is your father." Amen. This is your father right here. This message that God given us is the word restored. That's our father. That's that that's where you came from. That's your progeniator. That's your origin. That's the giver of your life. Amen. I've only been here to facilitate his will. The church is only here to be a help. Amen. But never. We are not the originators of life. Amen. The originator of life is father. Amen. The one who coddles and holds and protects and feeds and nurses, that's mother. But the originator of life is father.
